1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,340
(The sun shines bright.)

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,210
(Where is today's destination?)

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,910
- Isn't it great for running?
- It's perfect.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,810
- Go for a run then.
- This place is amazing.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,820
Let's run there.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,520
(Jogging)

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,390
Is this a river? It's not an ocean.

8
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,590
- It's a river. No, it's an ocean.
- No, it's not.

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,690
It's a river.
The ocean is over there in the back.

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,190
No. It's not an ocean.
It's an enclosed body of water.

11
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,560
No,
the ocean is over there in the back.

12
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,760
No.

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,430
Fine then!

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,370
- But it looks like an ocean.
- Whatever then!

15
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,400
It's not!

16
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,270
(It's a lake between a river
and an ocean.)

17
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,570
(An ocean and a lake coexist...)

18
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,080
(in this natural lagoon
called Gyeongpo Lake.)

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,120
(Today's destination glows
with emerald light.)

20
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,050
(Gangwon Province)

21
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,390
(Gangneung)

22
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,720
- My gosh.
- Hello.

23
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,190
- Hello.
- We came all the way to Gangneung.

24
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,260
Have you all been well?

25
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,460
- We've been well.
- Of course.

26
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,900
It seems everyone has been well.

27
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,200
- Looking at everyone today,
- Yes?

28
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,100
they must have been busy yesterday.

29
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,570
- Everyone seems so tired.
- You...

30
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,570
- Se Yoon...
- Really?

31
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,170
- This guy...
- Look at his face.

32
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,340
- This guy...
- What happened to him?

33
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,140
"Tasty Guys" ended around 2 a.m.

34
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,510
Joon started a new show.

35
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,540
So he filmed that yesterday.

36
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,050
The shoot for my new show
also ended late yesterday.

37
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,880
- Only I'm feeling great then.
- This is the worst.

38
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,180
- You're good too, right?
- Yes, I'm good.

39
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,280
- Yes, you're good too.
- Yes.

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,020
- Seon Ho. You too, right?
- I slept for eight hours.

41
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,550
- You slept a lot.
- Great.

42
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,820
Let's focus on us today.

43
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,990
- Okay.
- Let's focus on us today.

44
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,660
It's Team Energy
versus Team Fatigue.

45
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,290
It will be 3-on-3 today.
Joon, join us.

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,160
- You look out of it too.
- They're not feeling good.

47
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,360
- I look out of it?
- What did you do yesterday?

48
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,730
Why are you dressed
in a playful outfit?

49
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,170
I had no idea.

50
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,140
I woke up this morning,
saw this outfit, and put it on.

51
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,200
- How old are you?
- Really?

52
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,970
- It looks off, right? What do I do?
- No.

53
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,140
- No. It suits you.
- By the way...

54
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,340
- Doesn't it look weird on me?
- It's not that.

55
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,370
After losing his muscles,

56
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,780
he's been wearing
adorable outfits a lot, right?

57
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,080
Is that it?

58
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,550
- Are you trying to look adorable?
- Right.

59
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,750
He makes facial expressions...

60
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,010
- Yes.
- like this too.

61
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,850
- He was making this face.
- Right.

62
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,220
(Smiling with his eyes)

63
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,420
(Wincing in a cute way)

64
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,620
(Wincing again
for the 2nd and 3rd time)

65
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,060
(Wincing again for the 4th time)

66
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,620
(He maxes out
on his cuteness level.)

67
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,190
- You're acting cute a lot now.
- My gosh.

68
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,360
- You must have good news.
- Yes.

69
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,860
Look at him. His face is so red.

70
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,030
- He was spot on.
- Okay.

71
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,670
Now that I've lost my muscles,

72
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,440
I thought it would be nice
to wear cute outfits like this.

73
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,300
- Great. You look cute.
- Right.

74
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,870
- I'm trying something new.
- Okay.

75
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,340
Relatively speaking,
they're not feeling good.

76
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,440
- And we're feeling energetic.
- Yes.

77
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,780
Ironically, they're the ones...

78
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,080
who hiked Mount Halla
on Jeju Island.

79
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,380
- What is this?
- That's right.

80
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,380
- It's them.
- Right.

81
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,650
- How ironic.
- How was the hike? Good?

82
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,350
(They didn't expect
this kind of weather condition.)

83
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,130
(They hiked Mount Halla
despite the bad weather.)

84
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,670
(A grand journey
heading to Baekrok Spring)

85
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,570
Our staff members staggered
like this because it was so windy.

86
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,700
- Come on.
- I did hear that.

87
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,040
Seriously. It was no joke.

88
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,570
- Listen to the sound. It's crazy.
- We're serious.

89
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,040
- Come on.
- We're serious.

90
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,280
- I'll know once I watch it.
- We're not exaggerating it.

91
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,080
- I'll know once I watch it.
- By the way, it was funny.

92
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,520
I was going down in the back.

93
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,920
I said, "One, two."
I was going down.

94
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,090
Then I had a feeling that
I would start experiencing pain.

95
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,760
- Think about it. Mount Halla...
- I know.

96
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,590
I wanted to tell them about my pain,

97
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,290
so I'd be recognized
for my hard work.

98
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,730
I thought,
"Okay. I should tell them."

99
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,700
I was about to tell them.
Then all of a sudden, Joon went...

100
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,800
(Limping)

101
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,330
Then...

102
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,410
He was limping like this.
I called for him from the back.

103
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,440
Do you know what he said?

104
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,440
"I'm all right, Se Yoon.
I've always had bad knees."

105
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,280
"Don't worry about me. Go ahead."

106
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,710
"I'm fine."
Then he started to grunt.

107
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,350
All of a sudden, my pain went away.

108
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,020
There was nothing I could do.

109
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,920
I said, "Joon. I'll go down first."

110
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,790
Without him,
I could tell them about my pain.

111
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,390
I was going to tell them then.

112
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,960
- I was about to tell them.
- Was there someone else?

113
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,190
When I turned back, I spotted
Chul Seung who was filming me.

114
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,260
- Chul Seung?
- I'm serious.

115
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,900
There were two patients already.

116
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,100
That seriously happened.

117
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,000
Those two were limping down
the mountain.

118
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,170
He couldn't come down
because he was scared.

119
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,200
(Se Yoon's cameraman)

120
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,440
The wind might blow me away.

121
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,610
- What?
- The wind might blow me away.

122
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,670
Same here.

123
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,210
- The weather was really bad.
- Really?

124
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,910
When I was going down,
I was separated from them.

125
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,120
A writer was ahead of me.

126
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,820
- She was kind of short.
- Yes.

127
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,350
She was running down.

128
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
(Glancing)

129
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,460
I slowed down because I thought
she was rushing because of me.

130
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,790
Then after going down for a while...

131
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,590
(Turning back)

132
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,730
What? Really?

133
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,830
When I got close,

134
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,700
- she easily hiked down again.
- Really?

135
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,630
But you know what?
She did that for two hours.

136
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,170
- Who was that? She's good.
- She's that good?

137
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,000
It was her.
She was like a flying squirrel.

138
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,240
Her name is Park Tae Hee.

139
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,510
She's joining us from "Iron Squad."

140
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,970
- Really?
- Really?

141
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,180
She's from where?

142
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,240
She's from the special forces?

143
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,010
- Come on. Don't lie to us.
- I'm serious.

144
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,010
- It's the truth.
- Really?

145
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,610
- From the 777th Command?
- That doesn't make sense.

146
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,980
- Look.
- Are you from the 777th Command?

147
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,250
- No. She's from the show.
- Even the writer...

148
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,950
She worked on the show,
"Iron Squad."

149
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,390
The writers have to be strong
to join the show?

150
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,220
- Hey.
- That doesn't make sense.

151
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,030
She's a writer.
Writers on the show are strong too?

152
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,460
- Gosh, that's amazing.
- She's a writer.

153
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,830
She hopped down like this.

154
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,300
- She did that on Mount Halla.
- Like that?

155
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,400
(Hopping down)

156
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,700
- I'm serious. She hopped down.
- But...

157
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,270
actually, this is what I saw.

158
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,840
This is about Tae Hee.
We have big bottles of water.

159
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,470
I saw her carry eight of them
and run like this.

160
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,310
- Really?
- Come on.

161
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,410
I'm serious. It's a true story.

162
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,910
- She grabbed the bottles like this.
- Come on.

163
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,310
Come on, Sae Ho.

164
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,320
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm serious.

165
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,950
Why would you suddenly
exaggerate it?

166
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,490
Let me make some stuff up.
I've got nothing here.

167
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,360
- We also have stories.
- You punk.

168
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,260
- On Jeju Island...
- You guys saw dolphins.

169
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,560
- Gosh, the dolphins.
- Dolphins...

170
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,730
- They were amazing.
- To be honest,

171
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,030
- I feel bad for you guys.
- Okay.

172
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,900
It was such a therapeutic session
for us.

173
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,460
- It was therapeutic.
- It was touching.

174
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,900
When we went,

175
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,300
- we saw a pod of dolphins.
- Really?

176
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,330
- Like this.
- There was an entire pod.

177
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
(Jumping)

178
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,840
My gosh, look.

179
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,780
(Watching the dolphins up close)

180
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,340
So you saw a lot of them.

181
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,510
But how close were you?

182
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,150
That's important.
We were super close.

183
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,120
- Really?
- Let me tell you how close we were.

184
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
- You should stay out of it.
- We were close enough...
to touch them.

185
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,950
- If we reached...
- Did you set out...

186
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,890
- Like this.
- to make up stories today?

187
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,730
- We could've touched them.
- We were that close, though.

188
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,730
- Hey.
- Come on.

189
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,460
Our talk at the opening segment
was great.

190
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,500
- It was packed.
- How nice.

191
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,300
We're doing well
judging by the quality of our talk.

192
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Great.

193
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,600
During our trip to Jeju Island,
this was discussed many times.

194
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,900
- What?
- What was discussed?

195
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,740
"Teaming up with Joon..."

196
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,070
- "always ends in defeat."
- Gosh, yes.

197
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,610
That's how we ended up
on Mount Halla.

198
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,640
- I'm off to a bad start.
- Yes.

199
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,850
(It began
during the lunch mission in Jeju.)

200
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,750
Me. I know it.

201
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,350
(He was confident
about the animal quiz.)

202
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,960
(He got all 10 questions wrong,
the 1st in the show's history.)

203
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,660
(Make sure you don't have
the same answer as Joon.)

204
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,030
(This was an early sign
of the complete defeat for Joon.)

205
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,330
- Whoever didn't get to eat...
- Yes.

206
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,900
(They started to feel anxious
to team up with Joon.)

207
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,640
(Are you looking down on me?)

208
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
It should be a new idiom.
"Joon Leads to Defeat."

209
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,480
I've been on many shows
in my career.

210
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,150
My answer is always yes.

211
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,750
But when I was asked to team up with Joon,
for the first time,

212
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,020
I said no. I decided to say no.

213
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,180
- You became No Man Sae Ho.
- No Man Sae Ho.

214
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,250
That's precisely why
we came up with this theme.

215
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,390
- This episode is about Joon.
- Is it about the fools?

216
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,790
- Is he really the Defeat Fairy?
- What?

217
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,260
If he's not,

218
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,130
who is the true Defeat Fairy?
We're going to decide that.

219
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,430
(Who is the true Defeat Fairy?)

220
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,670
We will begin
the First Defeat Fairy Pageant.

221
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,470
(The Defeat Fairy Pageant
has begun.)

222
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,600
- I love it then.
- All right.

223
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,340
It's a chance for you
to clear your name.

224
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,870
- Yes. I like it.
- Yes.

225
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,440
All the missions will be played
as 3-on-3 games.

226
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,580
- The members of the losing team...
- Okay.

227
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,320
will get this badge.

228
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,850
That's a cute badge, though.

229
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,550
The member who becomes
the official Defeat Fairy...

230
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,490
with the most losses on the show...

231
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,060
- Okay.
- will have to stay behind...

232
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,390
after the show
when everyone has gone home tomorrow.

233
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,190
- Just him?
- The Defeat Fairy will do...

234
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,400
a mission,
appropriate for the title.

235
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,930
- Just him?
- That will be me then.

236
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,500
- Just one member.
- I think it might be me.

237
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
- Why would you think that?
- Just one?
You said you wouldn't be.

238
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,870
I think I'm being gaslighted.

239
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,500
You know what? This belongs to Joon.

240
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,570
- Look at the colors.
- Yes.

241
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,440
- The colors are perfect for him.
- It looks good on him.

242
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,970
"Don't lose me, son."

243
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,380
- Like a badge from his mom.
- It suits you.

244
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,980
Start with one badge
since it looks cute on you.

245
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,010
Right here.

246
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,080
- People might not notice it.
- Like a fashion accessory.

247
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,550
Put one on. The design looks good.

248
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,580
- Like a fashion accessory.
- Yes.

249
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,280
Oh, no. What do I do?
Even I think you're right.

250
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,350
It looks good on me.

251
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,350
Then you must first split
into teams...

252
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,860
- for your missions.
- Okay.

253
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,690
You'll divide into 2 teams of 3...

254
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,730
by Joon's decision...

255
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,700
as he's the biggest candidate
to become the Defeat Fairy.

256
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,700
Yes!

257
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,970
(We're in a tight spot then.)

258
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,000
Everyone is avoiding
to meet his eyes.

259
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,040
- Right.
- So...

260
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,810
He's picking the teams,
but we have our backs on him.

261
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,910
- I rarely say no to people.
- You were right.

262
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,170
Sae Ho was right.

263
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,980
Raise your hand
if you want to team up with him.

264
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,140
- Joon, why don't you choose?
- All right.

265
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,110
Just in case, is there anyone
who would like to team up with me?

266
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,680
All right. Raise your hand.

267
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,050
(Only Se Yoon raises his hand.)
Really?

268
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,390
So you shouldn't pick me.
I like you.

269
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,450
(Take the gesture only.
Don't pick me.)

270
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,590
- What are you doing?
- They're so mean, aren't they?

271
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,560
- He raised his hand.
- Get revenge on them.

272
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,760
- You're in.
- Gosh.

273
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,530
What are you doing?
You must be out of your mind.

274
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,460
- That's a powerful team.
- They're strong, indeed.

275
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,230
- I... But...
- Whom should we pick?

276
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,070
In your opinion, who's the weakest?

277
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,500
(The weakest?)

278
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,470
You should recruit someone
around your level...

279
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,440
or the weakest member and win.
That will restore your reputation.

280
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,540
- I've made my decision.
- You have?

281
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,540
(Whom will Joon pick?)

282
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,610
It's...

283
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,580
- the cute member.
- Cute?

284
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,050
Then it's not me for sure.

285
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,820
(Smiling)

286
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,090
- I agree.
- It's either DinDin or Sae Ho.

287
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,790
(Is it me as expected?)

288
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,660
- You're not the cute type, right?
- Yoo Seon Ho.

289
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,760
- What?
- Okay.

290
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,230
- Okay. Great.
- Really?

291
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,230
- Okay.
- Great.

292
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,930
- I'll show it to you.
- How is he cute?

293
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,430
- I'm cute.
- He's so tall.

294
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,040
(Acting cute)

295
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,700
- We've got the names for our teams.
- Like this.

296
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,340
They're Team Lee Joon.
We're Team No Joon.

297
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,770
- Yes, Team No Joon.
- That's good.

298
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,770
- Team Lee Joon.
- Team No Joon.

299
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,210
Joon's Absence Leads to Victory.
Joon Leads to Defeat.

300
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,910
Come on.

301
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,710
Do you like your teams?

302
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,850
- Yes.
- It's great.

303
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,280
- I love it.
- All right.

304
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,480
- Let's begin right away.
- Okay.

305
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,590
- Now?
- Set it up, please.

306
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,790
- We're starting right away.
- Okay.

307
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,290
- Hey.
- Let's show them.

308
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,460
(Which team will be the Defeat Fairy
in the first mission?)

309
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,390
- Guys, are you ready?
- Yes.

310
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,660
- Should we sit down?
- Yes.

311
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,460
Joon. You're the leader.
You sit over there.

312
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,730
- You must fight them.
- Yes.

313
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,900
- I'll crush them.
- And...

314
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,070
I'll sit in the middle
like Jeong Won Kwan of Sobangcha.

315
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,100
Let's destroy them. Okay?

316
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,370
Sit like you own this place.
Why do you look so polite?

317
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
It's them we're up against.

318
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,870
I don't even feel like
this is a real fight.

319
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,010
- I'm not nervous at all.
- I'm crossing my legs.

320
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,380
This is the first mission...

321
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,010
- of the Defeat Fairy Pageant.
- Okay.

322
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,110
It's the Word Association Quiz
with Initials.

323
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,520
- I like this.
- This is easy.

324
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,020
- Association?
- I like this.

325
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,520
- Association?
- This is going to be fun.

326
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,790
- Right.
- This is fun.

327
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,020
- I'm good at games like this.
- I'm good at this too.

328
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,920
You must give a word...

329
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,190
that fits the category and initials.

330
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,900
- Okay.
- There will be five rounds.

331
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,530
If you know the answer,
call out your name.

332
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,570
- Okay.
- Seon Ho.

333
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,430
You're ready, right?
Here's the first question.

334
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,500
(Here comes the first question.)

335
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,240
One, two,

336
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,110
three. Singers!

337
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,680
(Singers whose name begins with D)

338
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,880
- DinDin. Me.
- DinDin.

339
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,710
(DinDin: Correct)

340
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,750
- Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho.

341
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,310
- Do Won Kyoung.
- Great.

342
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,050
- Se Yoon. DAY6.
- Se Yoon.

343
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,250
- Okay. Joon.
- Joon.

344
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,320
Doh Kyung Soo.

345
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,150
- Seon Ho. The One.
- Jong Min.

346
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,150
- What?
- Jong Min.

347
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,260
- What did you say?
- The One?

348
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,260
- The One.
- They win.
- Okay.
- What were you doing?

349
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,660
- You know what?
- What were you doing?

350
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,760
- We're not that bad.
- Of course not.

351
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,900
What were you doing?

352
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,660
When I named myself,
you could've said DEAN.

353
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,200
Right, DEAN was one.

354
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,100
- What were you doing?
- What is this?

355
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,700
(Sorry, guys.)

356
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,240
You could've said DOYOTE.

357
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,310
Why didn't you say, DOYOTE?

358
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,940
You could've said that.

359
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,180
- Hey.
- Jong Min of DOYOTE.

360
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,310
- He's mocking me.
- They're leading by one point.

361
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,550
It's fine. We must let them have it.

362
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,750
- Let them have the first point.
- Okay. Hey.

363
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,180
We must let them have a point.
That will lower their guard.

364
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,250
Okay.

365
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,820
- That's my strategy.
- Let's begin.

366
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,390
One,

367
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,220
two, three. Korean movies.

368
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,420
(Korean movies that start with B)

369
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,760
- Jong Min.
- Seon Ho.

370
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,830
- "Bang Ja..."
- Wrong.

371
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,130
- Seon Ho. "The Grand Heist."
- "Bang Ja..."

372
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,260
DinDin.

373
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,000
"Veteran."

374
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,230
(DinDin: Correct)

375
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,830
- Joon. "Peppermint Candy."
- "Peppermint Candy."

376
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,540
- Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho.

377
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,570
"Man on the Edge."

378
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,570
(Sae Ho: Correct)

379
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,110
- "Man on the Edge."
- Hurry up.

380
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,140
Jong Min.

381
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,240
Se Yoon. "Violet Fragrance."

382
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,680
- Jong Min.
- No.

383
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,410
Why are you struggling with this?

384
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,550
- Why can't he think of one?
- It's...

385
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,580
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min.

386
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,620
- "The Unjust."
- Yes!

387
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,820
- Okay.
- That's it.

388
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,950
Correct.

389
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,460
(Team No Joon succeeds.)

390
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,660
That wasn't hard.

391
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,060
- There's no movie named that.
- What?

392
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,430
Se Yoon is awful at this.

393
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,330
Se Yoon,
why are you trying to be funny?

394
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,830
Hey, let's make it a close game.

395
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,430
No. Let's not do that.

396
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,130
Just relax as if you're watching TV.

397
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,430
- No.
- You'll think of one right away.

398
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,140
- When you see this on TV,
- Let's begin.

399
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,400
you're good at this.

400
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,410
- That's true.
- Pretend you're watching TV.

401
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,140
But you don't watch TV
by yourself these days.

402
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
- It's trash talk.
- Come on. Don't say that.

403
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,010
- Trash talk to shake him up.
- Yes.

404
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,050
You're not trash-talking.

405
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,050
- You're just being trash.
- Hey!

406
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,320
He made stuff up.

407
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,620
- Okay. You make stuff up too.
- Make it up.

408
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,020
- You...
- You make it up too.

409
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,250
- You have a kid, right?
- Let's go.

410
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,520
- What? What is this?
- This startled him.

411
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,890
- Your ears are turning red.
- Let's go. It's getting to him.

412
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,960
- Let's go.
- Hey.

413
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,320
I see. Joon doesn't watch TV alone.

414
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,930
- One, two,
- Okay.

415
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,900
three. Song titles.
You must name the singer too.

416
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,160
- DinDin.
- DinDin.

417
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,200
"HEYA" by IVE.

418
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,670
Sae Ho.
"Swallowtail" by Kim Heung Kook.

419
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,670
Jong Min.

420
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,300
"Under the Sky" by Kim Min Jong.

421
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,240
- Okay. That's correct.
- It's correct.

422
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,770
- There's a song named that.
- There is.

423
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,370
There's a song named
"Under the Sky."

424
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,440
It was released in 1997.

425
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,210
- Correct.
- Yes!

426
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,240
(Team No Joon succeeds.)

427
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,750
- My gosh. Nice.
- That's a real song?

428
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,110
I understood it wrong.

429
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,120
I thought both the singer
and the title must start with H.

430
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,650
See?
My trash talk messed with his head.

431
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,550
That's why I thought...

432
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,360
- This was such an easy one.
- It's...

433
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,520
(What a bummer.)

434
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,830
"Hula Hula Hula" by Hyun Sook.

435
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,890
One, two, three, four.

436
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,300
(Hula hula hula)

437
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,100
(He tries to answer it rather late.)

438
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
What's the correct title?

439
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,300
- "Dancing Tambourine."
- "Dancing Tambourine."

440
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,340
(The correct title is
"Dancing Tambourine.")

441
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,670
- All right.
- If we miss this, we lose.

442
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,870
- Right. If you miss this one...
- All right.

443
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,970
Let's go, Team.

444
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,140
One, two, three.

445
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,080
Song titles.
You must also name the singer.

446
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,380
Song titles? Sae Ho.

447
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,410
- Sae Ho.
- "Forever" by Lee Sun Hee.

448
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,450
- Se Yoon.
- "Forever."

449
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,350
"I'm Not Myself
When I'm Around You."

450
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,350
- By DinDin.
- Okay.
- You must sing it too.
- Se Yoon.

451
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,320
Se Yoon. "Summer Story" by Cool.

452
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,360
- Jong Min.
- Darn it.

453
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,660
(Jong Min!)

454
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,260
(If Jong Min gets it right,
this mission is over.)

455
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,200
Jong Min. "Fate" by Lee Seung Chul.

456
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,870
- Okay.
- Okay.

457
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,900
Nice.

458
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,840
(Does this mean
Joon is indeed the Defeat Fairy?)

459
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
- Okay.
- Joon.

460
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,340
(Swaying)

461
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,780
(Go away.)

462
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,950
Why are you drooling?

463
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,980
It's so funny.

464
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,420
Here's the result
of the first mission...

465
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,550
of the Defeat Fairy Pageant.

466
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,020
- Great.
- Okay.

467
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,160
- Team Lee Joon lost.
- We're going to win everything.

468
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,460
- Okay.
- We're going to win everything.

469
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,790
Bring them, Youngest.

470
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,190
Here are the Defeat Fairy Badges.

471
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,700
(Take the Defeat Fairy Badges.)

472
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,270
(Se Yoon, Joon, and Seon Ho
get 1 badge.)

473
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,570
Then let's head over
to the next spot.

474
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,500
Let's go!

475
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,740
This is nice.

476
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,040
We can kick back and enjoy this.

477
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,740
That's the lotus field.

478
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,550
It's the lotus field.

479
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,650
- Gosh, the lotus flowers.
- "The lotus field."

480
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,680
(You can check out the lotus flowers
in July and August.)

481
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,820
This is nice, by the way.

482
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,580
It's not too hot.

483
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,820
- This is nice.
- I'm so relieved.

484
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,290
Hey, they have nothing on us.

485
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,920
It's going to be an easy one today.

486
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,120
If I'm being honest,

487
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,920
you were a little weak
with this game, Jong Min.

488
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,030
You and I can just
stick together today.

489
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,490
- Totally.
- It doesn't matter whom we get.

490
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,560
Right.

491
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,200
You just need each other?

492
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,430
Here's the thing.
He and I have high winning rates.

493
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,870
- Right. It's not bad.
- Whenever we team up,

494
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,300
- we almost win every game.
- Really?

495
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,740
We're Ronaldo and Messi.
We're good with anyone.

496
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,710
- Of course.
- I can play defense.

497
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,740
- What?
- I'm on defense.

498
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,080
Right.
You were defending against us.

499
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,250
How did we end up losing again?

500
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,880
What's the cause of our defeat?

501
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,380
- No. Joon.
- Right.

502
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,050
We just lost. We were unlucky.

503
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,050
Let's be honest.
This is all about luck, isn't it?

504
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,250
- Right.
- This is about our skills.

505
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,390
Se Yoon was awful at it.

506
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,890
If I had REM sleep last night,

507
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,060
I would've thought of them
right away.

508
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,490
Hurry.

509
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,090
- I need to use the toilet. Hurry.
- Fifteen minutes...

510
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,060
The toilet is here. Let me use it.

511
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,230
- Do you want to use the toilet?
- Can you park it?

512
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,300
I can park it.

513
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,970
- Let's park it then.
- Okay. I'll stop here for a bit.

514
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,340
- I'll be back.
- Go ahead.

515
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,240
Thanks. You stopped
in front of the restroom.

516
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,070
- Go ahead.
- I can't move my legs.

517
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,310
(Se Yoon and Seon Ho
use the toilet.)

518
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,380
(He's leaving them there
instead of waiting for them?)

519
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,760
(Joon pedals off for a while
for some reason.)

520
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,460
What? What's going on?

521
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,690
(What's going on?)

522
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,930
Did he leave? He's pedaling away.

523
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,530
- You're on your own?
- Yes.

524
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,600
What about the other two?
You want them to walk?

525
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,730
Well,

526
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,300
I'm not sure.
I wanted to ride this alone.

527
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,040
Are they here?

528
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,470
That little...

529
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,640
(Se Yoon is spotted running
from afar.)

530
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,910
(Laughing)

531
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,150
Hey!

532
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,780
I'm sorry.

533
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,650
Good job. Keep going. Hurry.

534
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,660
Hurry. Let's go.

535
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,420
Go ahead. Come on, let's go.

536
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,690
- Shouldn't we wait for Seon Ho?
- It's okay.

537
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,560
It's not like you waited for me.

538
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,730
(They really set out,
leaving the youngest in the toilet.)

539
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,430
I just went for it.
I wanted to see how it would feel...

540
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,770
- Just go.
- to be on my own.

541
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,470
Where did they go?

542
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,870
What?

543
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,770
(Seon Ho is running
as hard as he can to catch up.)

544
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,680
- Hello?
- What are you doing?

545
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,240
I don't know. He was pedaling away.

546
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,910
- Stop it.
- Hurry.

547
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,420
- Come on.
- I barely managed to get on it too.

548
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,980
Hurry.

549
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,950
- Seon Ho.
- He's not coming?

550
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,020
He's running from afar.

551
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,020
- Stop.
- Hurry up.

552
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,160
- Hey, stop.
- Hurry.

553
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,430
Stop.

554
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,090
I told you to stop.

555
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,230
(Running as fast as he can)

556
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,830
Okay. We should let him hop on.

557
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,400
I'm sorry.

558
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,730
Look at him sweating.

559
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,340
(Exhausted)

560
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,540
This guy is evil.

561
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,110
I think I ran for 1km.

562
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,710
- You're sweating profusely.
- Seon Ho.

563
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,080
Step on it. We're falling behind.

564
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,740
- Let's go, Team.
- Let's do this.

565
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,710
We need to reset our mindset
this way.

566
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,580
Okay. Let's do better
starting with the next one.

567
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,280
- Let's go.
- Okay.

568
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,290
(They set out for the next mission.)

569
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,750
Would you say
you guys have good luck?

570
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,020
- No, but the first game...
- That was all about luck.

571
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,630
I'll be blunt.
Se Yoon didn't do well.

572
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,730
But it depends on
how you look at it.

573
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,860
Here's an example.
Losing games on our show...

574
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,400
and suffering...

575
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,300
would be equivalent
to being blessed by the deity...

576
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,470
when it comes to variety shows.

577
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,210
- Really?
- If you consider that,

578
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,640
- you're lucky.
- Actually,

579
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,210
if you think about our last trip
on Jeju Island,

580
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,580
Joon was the winner...

581
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,480
- in terms of entertainment value.
- Right.

582
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,350
- He's lucky in that sense.
- Considering the airtime,

583
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,380
- he's...
- It's not something you can force.

584
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,820
- Right.
- That's...

585
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,150
(The legend of 0 points)

586
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,660
Other entertainers
might secretly envy him.

587
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,160
- Aren't I right?
- Of course.

588
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,830
- It's not an easy feat.
- If you try...

589
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,560
- to force it, it shows.
- Right.

590
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,000
It proves that
Joon is genuinely dense.

591
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,300
- Right.
- This is...

592
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,830
- Seriously.
- Otherwise, it'd show.

593
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,100
- It looks so natural to me.
- Right.

594
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,070
(It didn't look like
you were faking it.)

595
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,700
- It looks so natural.
- Right. A fool recognizes a fool.

596
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,040
- You can recognize your own.
- Right.

597
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,770
- He's the real deal.
- Jong Min recognized you.

598
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,240
- They can recognize each other.
- Right.

599
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,180
You know what? We often say that
Joon is the Defeat Fairy.

600
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,980
But we don't have any statistics.

601
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,020
- I'm curious.
- Right.

602
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,750
Let's ask an AI
about the statistics.

603
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,890
- That's great.
- We must use statistics.

604
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,220
- What? We can ask an AI?
- Seriously. You're so smart.

605
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,890
I asked ChatGPT.

606
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,930
"What's the win-loss record
for Joon, Se Yoon, Seon Ho,"

607
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,890
"Jong Min, Sae Ho,
and DinDin on 2 Days and 1 Night 4?"

608
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,960
"The staff didn't reveal
any statistics."

609
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,900
"But given the recent episodes
of the show,"

610
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,270
"DinDin often ranked high
in agility missions..."

611
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,840
"and missions where the losers would
have to dive and get left behind."

612
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,100
- "He's been performing well."
- That's good.

613
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,470
"Cho Sae Ho also wins
rock-paper-scissors..."

614
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,810
"or certain games so luckily..."

615
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,240
"that even the staff
gets surprised."

616
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,680
This is good. It's no joke.

617
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,550
"On the other hand, Moon Se Yoon,
Kim Jong Min, and Yoo Seon Ho..."

618
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,680
"often show patterns of losing..."

619
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,750
"or get eliminated..."

620
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,880
"from missions that require focus
or from regular games."

621
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,020
I asked about Joon.

622
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,120
(They're curious about
the evaluation on Joon the most.)

623
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,490
"Lee Joon has been captured,
losing..."

624
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,630
"in many games that require luck
or physical strength."

625
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,460
"One of his main defeats was..."

626
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,060
"in a leg wrestling match
against the director."

627
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,000
"He was humiliated in front
of the members and the staff."

628
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,140
I had forgotten about that
completely.

629
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
He's got it.

630
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,240
(A memorable scene
even the AI remembers.)

631
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,280
- It's accurate.
- It really is.

632
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,310
It's unforgettable.

633
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,150
Sae Ho and I have been recognized
by the AI for our competence.

634
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,150
- That's nice.
- You have a good reputation.

635
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,620
We're like Ronaldo and Messi.

636
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,220
(Ronaldo and Messi
of 2 Days and 1 Night)

637
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,320
What about me?

638
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,120
- You?
- Even AI doesn't recognize him.

639
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,720
If I compare you to a soccer player,

640
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,490
I'd be belittling him.
It'd be awkward.

641
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,490
Exactly.

642
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,100
(Lee Joon is still the Defeat Fairy
for now.)

643
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,900
Where are we?
Is it a tourist attraction?

644
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,670
Wait a minute. We're at the sea.

645
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,610
Let's go, everyone.

646
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,510
What's this?
I like things like this.

647
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,980
- It's a cafe.
- It's a cafe.

648
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,280
- I like cafes.
- Are we going to a cafe?

649
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,480
- Do we go in?
- Is it a cafe?

650
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,080
Are we going to a cafe? Really?

651
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,280
(What awaits them at this place?)

652
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,120
- This is the place.
- Look at the view.

653
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,490
This is it.

654
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,990
(A panoramic view of the sea)

655
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,460
(In love)

656
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,860
The view is amazing.

657
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,330
It's the most well-known beach in
Gangneung where many tourists visit.

658
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,200
It's Gangmun Beach.

659
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,370
- Gangmun Beach.
- Gangmun Beach?

660
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,100
Gangmun Beach is famous.

661
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,040
In case the weather was hot,

662
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,370
we found an indoor place for you.

663
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,740
- You have good manners.
- Thank you.

664
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,310
All right, you're Team Lee Joon...

665
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,750
- and Team No Joon.
- Team No Joon.

666
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Are you happy
with your team members?

667
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,580
- I'm very happy.
- They aren't bad.

668
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,750
I feel comfortable around them.

669
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,920
I don't think they're perfect.

670
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,860
I still lack in many ways.

671
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,790
Before I announce the next mission,

672
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,430
I'd like to give you a chance
to remove your teammates.

673
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,430
That's great.

674
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,660
- "Remove."
- We don't care, do we?

675
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,730
We're fine.

676
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,900
- We don't need to.
- No.

677
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,300
Only the losing team gets a chance
to remove their teammates.

678
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,370
Have you ever been
a class president?

679
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,370
Yes, I have.

680
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,610
Show us your leadership
from back then.

681
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,340
- This team is named after you.
- Okay.

682
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,540
I won't change my teammates.

683
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,150
I'll show you my leadership instead.

684
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,150
Why?

685
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,380
- Joon, you need to do this too.
- Why?

686
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,480
- Why?
- You need to be able to say,

687
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,950
- "You get out."
- Don't leave this team.

688
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,090
Why not?

689
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,650
- Which one was the most annoying...
- Stay on this team.

690
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,720
on the other team during the game?

691
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,120
Bring him onto your team.

692
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,760
He should bring the ace player
onto his team.

693
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,090
- I made up my mind.
- Yes?

694
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,030
Get out, Seon Ho.

695
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,030
Get out.

696
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,430
(He looks happy.)

697
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,530
Jong Min, please join me.

698
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,100
(Recruiting Kim Jong Min)

699
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,710
- That works.
- It turned into a mess.

700
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,810
Why?

701
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,880
- That's impressive.
- I mean...

702
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,950
(The fate of the two changed
with Joon's words.)

703
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,010
Why you...

704
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,680
Are you trying to make me stand out?

705
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,850
You have expertise.

706
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,860
We won't do quizzes
with initials anymore, will we?

707
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,790
I was looking at the bigger picture
for 2 Days and 1 Night.

708
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,330
You lack experience on the show.

709
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,330
- Really?
- By the way...

710
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,590
Jong Min should have
a lot of experience.

711
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,930
Whatever the reason, thank you.

712
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,070
Se Yoon, Joon, and Jong Min.

713
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,500
They're Team Lee Joon.

714
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,800
DinDin, Sae Ho, and Seon Ho.

715
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,000
- They're Team No Joon.
- No Joon.

716
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,170
We don't know what we'll do next.

717
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,010
- We don't know.
- We don't know what we'll do.

718
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,180
We have years of experience.

719
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,710
The second round
of the Defeat Fairy Pageant.

720
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,050
Relay Random Chance Mission,

721
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,350
it's called
What, How, and With Whom.

722
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,550
"Relay Random Chance?"

723
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,020
Each of you will pick...

724
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,790
what, how, and with whom.

725
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,490
After the selection,

726
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,230
you'll clear the given mission
with the assigned member.

727
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,890
(Clear the mission
based on the combination that you pick)

728
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,230
It will be a relay.

729
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,500
Is it a relay?
We have to play nonstop.

730
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,230
The first player on each team...

731
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,570
must come back
after clearing the mission.

732
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,440
Then the next player can start.

733
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,870
The team
whose last player finishes first...

734
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,070
will be the winner. Got it?

735
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,080
We have to do it with citizens
no matter what.

736
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,640
- I'm shy around new people.
- Me too.

737
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,450
Gosh, this is...

738
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,580
(INFPs who are shy
are on the same team.)

739
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,350
Clearing missions with citizens?
Don't worry about a thing.

740
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,290
- We have you.
- That's right.

741
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,720
- I can approach them with ease.
- Okay.

742
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,220
You must clear the missions
on the beach.

743
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,060
- Okay.
- There aren't many people.

744
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,290
- There are only a few.
- Right.

745
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,760
(An unexpected variable:
The beach is empty.)

746
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,300
Finding people will be
based on luck.

747
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,270
Selecting someone
who's easy to find is also based on luck.

748
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,330
Right.

749
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,000
"How" is something you must do...

750
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,870
as soon as you depart from here.

751
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,070
- Really?
- For example,

752
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,310
if you pick "3 steps, 1 squat,"

753
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,310
you must do it from here
to the beach.

754
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,350
That's intense.

755
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,710
"Wear a mouth gag."

756
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,850
- You know samba, don't you?
- Yes.

757
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,580
Can you show us...

758
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,920
- how to dance samba?
- Okay.

759
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,020
Jong Hyun, demonstrate it for us.

760
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,490
I'm a terrible dancer.

761
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,530
Everyone, look at this.

762
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,630
(A video that he's prepared)

763
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,160
- Do you see it?
- I can't see it.

764
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,400
I can't see it.

765
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,060
I don't get it at all.
How do you do it?

766
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,170
How can I do that?

767
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,200
Can you demonstrate it a little?

768
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,970
We need to see how it's done.

769
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,800
This is very embarrassing.

770
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,470
You don't think
it's embarrassing for us?

771
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,170
- What about us?
- I'll hold your hand.

772
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,240
Come out.

773
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,710
- The two of you should do it.
- Come out.

774
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,640
Wait a minute.

775
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,080
(Dragging)

776
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,110
- Show us a little.
- How can we do it?

777
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,280
- Show us.
- No.

778
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,720
- Then how can we know?
- Get up.

779
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,050
- I really can't do it.
- What are you talking about?

780
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,550
Show it to us.

781
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,090
(Forcing him to dance samba)

782
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,690
I can't do it.

783
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,160
Show us.

784
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,030
You have to shake like this.

785
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,960
(Struggling to end it quickly)

786
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,970
How?

787
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,530
Show us a little.

788
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,140
No.

789
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,500
(He feels bad for Jong Hyun.)

790
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,910
You can get yourself blurred.

791
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,310
- How do we do it?
- "Blurred?"

792
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,310
Do we dance like this?

793
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,580
You don't shake like this.

794
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,980
- You have to shake like this.
- We should look at each other.

795
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,350
- All right.
- That was funny.

796
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,680
You have no more questions, right?

797
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,780
Okay.

798
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,880
(What, How, and With Whom,
The relay order)

799
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,720
(Team Lee Joon, Team No Joon)

800
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,950
- Number 2 and 3.
- Okay.

801
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,760
Who wants to go 1st?
Do the 3 of you want to start?

802
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,260
Number one, what.

803
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,430
Yes.

804
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,430
It's tangsuyuk game.

805
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,860
- That's a good one.
- You're good at it.

806
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,670
(That's good.)

807
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,270
That's one of the easier ones.

808
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,570
(What: Tangsuyuk game)

809
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,570
"While hula hooping."

810
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,240
- That's not bad.
- You're good at it.

811
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,510
- It's okay.
- I know how to hula hoop.

812
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,880
It's okay.

813
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,150
(Don't worry.)

814
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,650
He picked good ones.

815
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,580
The difficult part is with whom.

816
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,620
"With someone
whose shoe size is 270mm."

817
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,120
That's easy.

818
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,520
- He got easy ones.
- For now...

819
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,860
Next is Joon.

820
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,190
I picked the game of ddakji.

821
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,460
Okay.

822
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,300
If he fails, the ddakji game
should go to someone else.

823
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,660
Okay.

824
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,000
He picked such an easy one.

825
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,570
- All right.
- How?

826
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,470
"Wear a mouth gag."

827
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,140
- That's the worst.
- Okay.

828
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,740
Okay, the mouth gag!

829
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,240
I hate mouth gags.

830
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,940
"With someone holding a beverage."

831
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,440
That would be easy to find.

832
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,180
(Joon: Play a game of ddakji
with someone holding a beverage...)

833
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,480
(while wearing a mouth gag,
Sae Ho: Play the tangsuyuk game...)

834
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,680
(with someone whose shoe size is
270mm while hula hooping)

835
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,920
Are those choices gone?

836
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,880
- Are they gone?
- Of course.

837
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,250
They took the easy ones.

838
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,320
- You're right.
- I didn't like the mouth gag.

839
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,990
- The mouth gag is bad.
- The worst part is...

840
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,260
that it looks horrible.

841
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,360
It'd give you more airtime.

842
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,660
- Right.
- I'd be happy to wear it.

843
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
(His appearance stands out.)

844
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,430
Look at Joon.

845
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,230
Are you okay, Joon?

846
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,770
(Is this right?)

847
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,840
You're drooling. Be careful.

848
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,140
Ask me to play ddakji.

849
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,640
- Hello.
- How about a game of ddakji?

850
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,770
- What did you say?
- A ddakji game.

851
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,710
- Do what?
- A ddakji game.

852
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,240
- What?
- A ddakji game.

853
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,180
You have nice teeth.

854
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,880
(Despite the bad luck,
he has a set of strong teeth.)

855
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,820
- We'll start.
- Let's start.

856
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,420
- Get ready.
- Joon.

857
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,390
You must win no matter what.

858
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,520
- Get ready.
- Okay.

859
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,260
- Let's win.
- Good luck.

860
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,260
Let's win.

861
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,660
Now that they're gone,
can you give us beverages?

862
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,900
Let's have the losing team pay.

863
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,330
The three members can decide
who gets to pay.

864
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,070
Someone will treat us anyway,

865
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,400
- so can we get the drinks first?
- Let's get something.

866
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,570
The losing team will pay.

867
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,840
Can we get the drinks on credit?

868
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,670
(Quick)

869
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,880
(Joon dashed away fast.)

870
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,240
It's not working.

871
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,280
(Sae Ho is struggling
from the start.)

872
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,580
This is loose.

873
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,980
(Joon, Sae Ho)

874
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,150
(There's already a gap
from the start.)

875
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,320
(He lost his good looks,
but he's got free legs.)

876
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,990
(Looking around)

877
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,660
(Thankfully,
there's a crowd of people.)

878
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,300
(He must find someone
holding a beverage.)

879
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,400
It's him.

880
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,500
(No one is holding a beverage?)

881
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,140
There's no one.

882
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,710
There's no one.

883
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,910
(He can't find someone
holding a beverage.)

884
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,980
There's no one.

885
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,180
Joon is having a hard time
finding someone.

886
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,950
Joon has to play a game of ddakji?

887
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,610
There's no one holding a beverage.

888
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,390
(Among these many people,
no one is holding a beverage.)

889
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,890
(Sae Ho barely arrived
at the beach.)

890
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,360
Hello.

891
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,390
(Joon, Sae Ho)

892
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,030
Hello, sir.

893
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,330
(He finds someone to play with.)

894
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,670
Sir,
could you come here for a minute?

895
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,930
It won't take long.

896
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,970
Can you come here for a minute?

897
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,570
(He's happy to come near him.)

898
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,870
Hello.

899
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,640
My goodness.

900
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,710
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

901
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,410
Excuse me,
but may I ask for your shoe size?

902
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,850
(I'm looking for someone
who fits in this shoe.)

903
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,950
One moment.

904
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,350
- Still...
- My feet are huge.

905
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,250
(The person for the mission:
Someone with a shoe size of 270mm)

906
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,990
(Will the shoe fit him?)

907
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,890
- It fits.
- My foot went in.

908
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,360
Okay.

909
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,890
(He found the person
for the mission fast.)

910
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,300
You just have to play
a game with me.

911
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,500
It's called tangsuyuk game.

912
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,230
When I say, "Tang,"

913
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,830
you say, "Su." I say, "Yuk."

914
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,970
We take turns saying tang, su, yuk.

915
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,370
- I just have to win, right?
- That's right.

916
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,010
Sir, do you understand?

917
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,440
- Yes.
- You understand the game?

918
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,580
All right, here we go.

919
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,580
(Sae Ho just needs to win.)

920
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,940
I must hurry. Ready.

921
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,580
He's playing the tangsuyuk game.

922
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,980
You can do it!

923
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,120
Please do your best
and defeat Sae Ho!

924
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,220
Start. Tang.

925
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,520
- Su.
- Yuk.

926
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,550
- Tang.
- Su.

927
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,790
- Tang.
- I won.

928
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,090
- Tang.
- Su.

929
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,290
- Tang.
- I won.

930
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,030
I won.

931
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,460
(Oh, my.)

932
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Thank you.

933
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,130
I won.

934
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,940
I cleared the mission. I won, right?

935
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,100
- That's right. You may go back.
- Do I have to keep doing this?

936
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,370
- Do I have to do it?
- As you go.

937
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,410
I also have to do it on my way back?

938
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,280
(Taking a long time to go back)

939
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,380
Hurry up, Sae Ho!

940
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,490
It really hurts.

941
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,090
(I want to hurry back too.)

942
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:14,890
(Meanwhile, Ddakji Man Joon...)

943
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,830
(He's looking for someone
with a beverage.)

944
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,060
Where is he going?

945
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,900
He should attract people
on the sidewalk.

946
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
Exactly.

947
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,230
Isn't there anyone with a beverage?

948
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,330
(He's getting farther away.)

949
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,840
(Looking around)

950
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,770
- Excuse me... Hello.
- Yes?

951
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,150
Are you okay
with appearing in a TV show?

952
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,980
- Pardon?
- This is 2 Days and 1 Night.

953
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,720
Are you okay
with appearing in a TV show?

954
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,550
(Joon gets his chance to try.)

955
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,550
Sir.

956
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,620
(Opening his briefcase)

957
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,890
Will you play
a game of ddakji with me?

958
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,830
- A game of ddakji.
- Okay.

959
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,030
Will you play it with me?

960
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,300
Sir.

961
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,130
I'll let you play first.

962
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,500
Please slap it.

963
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,500
(How dare you challenge me?)

964
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,510
(Will he succeed in his first try?)

965
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,580
- Gosh.
- Nice.

966
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,940
From here...

967
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,310
(Joon gets his chance right away.)

968
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,310
(Groaning)

969
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,580
(Failed)

970
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,080
Put it in the center.

971
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,150
All right.

972
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,660
(He almost had it.)

973
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,330
(It's Joon's turn again.)

974
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,400
(He has no more time to lose.)

975
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,260
Okay!

976
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,570
(It got flipped!)

977
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,240
(Joon cleared his mission.)

978
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,470
Thank you, sir.

979
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,470
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

980
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,570
(The young man is working hard.)

981
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,040
(He runs back immediately.)

982
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,380
- Joon is coming back.
- He's coming.

983
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,050
He's coming back.

984
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,250
I'm drooling so much.

985
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,790
Sae Ho is back.

986
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,460
What's going on?

987
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,890
- Shouldn't you hula hoop?
- Sit down.

988
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,360
I don't have to hula hoop
while playing the game.

989
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,630
Did the shoe fit him?

990
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,100
- It fit him perfectly.
- Really?

991
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,200
(Picking his mission right away)

992
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,300
- All right.
- What is it?

993
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,340
"Do the E.T. pose
after Elephant Nose Spin."

994
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,440
- This is easy.
- Hurry.

995
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,540
I'm good at this.

996
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,270
- "Three steps, one squat."
- Okay, it's okay.

997
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,340
- With whom?
- I got 3 steps, 1 squat.

998
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,340
(How: While doing 3 steps, 1 squat)

999
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,180
- It can't be someone who's tall.
- Sunglasses.

1000
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,580
- Sunglasses.
- Go now.

1001
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,610
Finding someone
with sunglasses is easy.

1002
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,080
A lifeguard would be
wearing sunglasses.

1003
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,520
Joon is coming back.

1004
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,790
One, two, three.

1005
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,220
(3 steps, 1 squat)

1006
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,800
Seon Ho.

1007
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,270
He's standing on the left.

1008
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,570
(Joon who's going back
inside quickly)

1009
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,570
Seon Ho.

1010
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,200
(Paper Doll's legs
got weak already.)

1011
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,210
Seon Ho.

1012
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,710
You can ask people
to come to the beach.

1013
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,880
He's back.

1014
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,140
Sit down right away.

1015
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,850
Sit down right away.

1016
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,650
Okay.

1017
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,420
Which one should I pick first?

1018
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,220
- With whom.
- This is with whom.

1019
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,290
(The 2nd player from Team Lee Joon,
Jong Min)

1020
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,820
"With someone in a group
of four or more."

1021
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,020
- "Wear acupressure slippers."
- Okay.

1022
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,330
And do what?

1023
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,390
- "Stocking water cup challenge."
- Okay.

1024
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,430
- Jong Min, goodbye.
- Don't put in on a citizen.

1025
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,070
- See you later.
- Take off your socks.

1026
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:13,170
(The stocking water cup challenge)

1027
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,270
(Jong Min departs.)

1028
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,310
(Groaning)

1029
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,010
(He enters the beach while limping.)

1030
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,920
(Both Jong Min and Seon Ho
are on the beach.)

1031
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,420
No one is wearing sunglasses.

1032
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,950
It's difficult.

1033
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,120
(He doesn't see any sunglasses,
and his legs are shaking.)

1034
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,390
Hi.

1035
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,160
Where are you from?

1036
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,800
Where are you from?

1037
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,600
Say Pyeongtaek.

1038
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
(He finds a family on vacation.)

1039
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,830
- Are you from Pyeongtaek?
- Yes.

1040
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,300
- The three of you?
- Right.

1041
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,740
I see. Hello.

1042
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,770
(It must be a group
of four or more.)

1043
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,240
Three people aren't enough.

1044
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,240
- We need a group of four.
- That's unfortunate.

1045
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,010
Enjoy your trip.

1046
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1047
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,310
Jong Min, what are you doing?

1048
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,380
What are you doing, Jong Min?

1049
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,780
Jong Min.

1050
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,990
Your 11 o'clock.

1051
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,690
Run toward your 11 o'clock.

1052
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,020
Where?

1053
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,860
Hello.

1054
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,500
Were you taking photos?

1055
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,130
Hello.

1056
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,900
Did the four of you come together?

1057
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,970
- Yes.
- Really?

1058
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,670
We're shooting 2 Days and 1 Night.

1059
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,840
Could you play a game with me?

1060
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,140
(At this rate,
Jong Min will turn the tables.)

1061
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,640
I'll put on the stocking.

1062
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,080
You just need to pull it off.

1063
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,610
It's not difficult.

1064
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,220
Hello, are you a couple?

1065
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,390
I'm married too.

1066
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,050
I'll put it on top right here.

1067
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,190
Grab this and pull it instantly.

1068
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,360
Strong and instant.

1069
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,630
It looks difficult.

1070
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,660
- It's not difficult.
- It looks difficult.

1071
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
- Put it on my cheek.
- On your cheek?

1072
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,030
I'll count to three.

1073
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,070
From here?

1074
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,200
- It's slipping.
- Is it slipping?

1075
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,670
You just need to keep it still.

1076
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,480
All right. In 3, 2, 1.

1077
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,380
(What will be the result?)

1078
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,450
One.

1079
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,550
- Failed.
- Gosh.

1080
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,620
Sir.

1081
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,280
What are you doing?

1082
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,020
(He also failed to pull off
the stocking.)

1083
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,520
You had to pull this off.

1084
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,360
(Now, he has to find
another group of 4.)

1085
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,790
The cup fell.

1086
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,400
Thank you. Have a good day.

1087
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,500
(The game is back to square one.)

1088
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,300
(Seon Ho is desperately looking
for someone wearing sunglasses.)

1089
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,740
Hello, sir.

1090
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,840
Hello, sir.

1091
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,870
(Seon Ho spots someone
wearing sunglasses.)

1092
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,010
Hello.

1093
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,040
(No matter how excited he is,
he must continue doing the squats.)

1094
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,080
Hello.

1095
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,080
Hello.

1096
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
(Bowing)

1097
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,920
Seon Ho found someone.

1098
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,550
Do ten Elephant Nose Spins.

1099
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,090
Then touch the tip of my finger...

1100
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,550
- like E.T.
- Okay.

1101
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,660
Can you do it with me?

1102
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,860
Just once? Thank you.

1103
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,890
Okay.

1104
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,530
(He spots Seon Ho.)

1105
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,630
My feet hurt so much.

1106
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,730
(He's in a hurry,
and his feet are in pain.)

1107
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,670
Get ready, set, go.

1108
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,670
(Seon Ho starts.)

1109
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,100
One, two,

1110
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,070
three, four,

1111
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,140
five, six,

1112
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,510
seven.

1113
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,310
Eight.

1114
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,810
(His legs got weak
from doing squats.)

1115
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,650
Eight,

1116
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,720
nine.

1117
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,120
Seon Ho,
you have to spin one more time.

1118
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,320
Ten.

1119
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,620
(They finish spinning ten times.)

1120
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,120
(They must touch
each other's finger in one go.)

1121
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,790
(Seon Ho clears the mission.)

1122
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,490
- Success.
- Okay, thank you.

1123
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,030
Thank you so much.

1124
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,230
(I hope that you win.)

1125
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,630
You have to do the same
on your way back.

1126
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,900
I'm so dizzy.

1127
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,100
(It's killing me.)

1128
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,810
Hurry up.

1129
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,010
Okay, Seon Ho succeeded.

1130
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,510
What is Jong Min doing?

1131
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,780
(Jong Min can't advance fast.)

1132
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,850
It really hurts.

1133
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,820
Hello.

1134
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,950
Hello.

1135
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,250
(Did Jong Min find
a group of 4 people?)

1136
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,290
DinDin.

1137
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,820
Okay, sit down.

1138
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,390
Here I go.

1139
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,830
With whom.

1140
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,660
(The last player
from Team No Joon, DinDin)

1141
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,230
"With someone in the sea."

1142
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,230
- I see someone.
- Okay.

1143
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,470
"Sing every word I say."

1144
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,740
Hello

1145
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,670
I'm DinDin and get called sexy

1146
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,140
I'll be back

1147
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,540
In the sea

1148
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,540
(The last player, DinDin, departs.)

1149
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,580
(Hello)

1150
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,780
(A street musician appears.)

1151
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:22,050
(Find someone in the water.)

1152
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,320
(Hello)

1153
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,820
(Is the water cold?)

1154
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,520
I can go in the water like this

1155
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,560
(A strange man is approaching
while singing.)

1156
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,530
- Aren't you going in the water?
- I am.

1157
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,630
Can you show me?

1158
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,930
That's so amazing

1159
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,940
(He shows his dive
to a strange man.)

1160
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,610
(Enjoying the sea
with this whole body)

1161
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,640
That's amazing.

1162
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,510
How do I look
when I dance like this?

1163
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,510
(You look sexy.)

1164
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,680
(How do I look
when I dance like this?)

1165
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,650
(You look strange.)

1166
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,090
(My friend)

1167
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,890
(How do I look
when I dance like this?)

1168
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,290
(No response)

1169
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,990
Please answer me

1170
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,700
(He's at a loss for words
due to the shocking dance moves.)

1171
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,030
(DinDin is facing a huge obstacle.)

1172
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,440
Hey, Jong Min!

1173
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,070
There are people over there.

1174
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,200
(A golden opportunity
for Team Lee Joon)

1175
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,340
There's a family. I should ask them.

1176
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,980
Hello.

1177
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,610
(He puts on a stocking
all of a sudden.)

1178
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,610
I'll explain.

1179
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,750
Pull it hard enough
to make it come off my head.

1180
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,450
Please put it on.
(He has a chance
to turn the tables.)

1181
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,090
- Instantly.
- Do it when I count to three.

1182
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:33,560
(Will he be able to succeed
this time?)

1183
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,960
One, two, three.

1184
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,290
(He pulled it.)

1185
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,430
Two, three.

1186
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,760
Failed.

1187
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,700
You almost had it, right?

1188
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,030
All right.

1189
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,600
Have a good time. Thank you.

1190
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,670
Why is it so hard
to find a group of four people?

1191
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,140
(Empty)

1192
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,480
I'm sweating on my back.

1193
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
(Even still, he keeps looking
instead of giving up.)

1194
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,010
- Oh, no. He failed.
- Gosh, my legs.

1195
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,250
Se Yoon, I don't think
your turn will come.

1196
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,880
I feel bad for Jong Min.

1197
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
What's Jong Min's mission?

1198
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,150
How do I look
when I dance like this?

1199
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,220
(Just like Jong Min,
DinDin is struggling too.)

1200
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,220
Okay. I should find someone else.

1201
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,220
(He gives up.)
Darn it.

1202
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,960
(He shifts directions
as he starts running.)

1203
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,560
(He must find someone
in the water first.)

1204
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,460
(He spots someone in the water.)

1205
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,560
Are you okay?

1206
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,870
Isn't the water cold?

1207
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,870
It's not so cold.

1208
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,570
How do I look
when I dance like this?

1209
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,610
(Will she say he looks sexy?)

1210
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,910
Please answer me

1211
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,910
(Please answer me)

1212
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,210
- You look sexy.
- You look sexy.

1213
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:31,610
Thank you

1214
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,980
(DinDin completed his mission.)

1215
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,050
Okay.

1216
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,860
(All the members of Team No Joon
have completed their missions.)

1217
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,920
(Jong Min, DinDin,
The winner was decided at the end.)

1218
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,830
My feet hurt so much.
It's so painful.

1219
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,530
You don't have to run. You can walk.

1220
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,430
Only I never got to draw anything.
Can I try it just for fun?

1221
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,670
With a couple, I play catching
cookies with my mouth. How?

1222
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,700
While dancing samba.

1223
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,040
Se Yoon, you should do this.
Come on. He should do this.

1224
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,170
(The samba performance
to commemorate the defeat)

1225
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,280
He should do this.

1226
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,280
(We won't get to see him do it.)
Let him try the mission anyway.

1227
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,750
Just for fun.

1228
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,920
(DinDin arrives
in a relaxed manner.)

1229
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,120
(Disappointed)

1230
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
(They sing together,
enjoying the victory.)

1231
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,650
You just have to pick up the flag.

1232
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,960
- Okay.
- Okay.

1233
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
(Team No Joon wins
the second round.)

1234
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,660
- Se Yoon, go. You should go now.
- Me?

1235
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,330
He's just annoyed...

1236
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,400
that Se Yoon
doesn't have to do a mission.

1237
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,100
The losing team of the second round
of the Defeat Fairy Pageant is...

1238
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,370
Team Lee Joon.

1239
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,940
All right.

1240
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,940
What's become clear
through this mission is...

1241
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,510
- that Seon Ho wasn't the problem.
- Okay.

1242
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,080
Seon Ho wasn't the problem?

1243
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,310
- This way, we'll find out...
- That's right.

1244
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,510
who causes the team to lose.

1245
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,520
Joon, this is only the beginning.
It's just begun.

1246
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,820
All right.

1247
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,250
Where? Is this it?

1248
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,790
- Haven't we been here before?
- No.

1249
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,060
- Hello.
- Hello.

1250
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,690
- This is it.
- Is this it?

1251
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,760
We're here. This is it.

1252
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,390
- Let's go in.
- This place is famous.

1253
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,390
Hello.

1254
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,660
Sae Ho and DinDin,
you still have no badges.

1255
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,670
Of course.

1256
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,300
I'm pretty sure
we won't get any badges today.

1257
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,400
Exactly. I have...

1258
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,600
I have a good feeling about this.

1259
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,670
- Give us another type of badge.
- Gosh, Joon.

1260
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,640
I joined the wrong team.

1261
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,410
What's important on this show
isn't placing first.

1262
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,910
It is important
to avoid placing last.

1263
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:09,980
Se Yoon is right.

1264
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,620
- What are we eating?
- You must be hungry now.

1265
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,080
- Yes, I'm hungry.
- I'm starving.

1266
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
- Okay.
- It's past noon.

1267
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,290
The dish
you'll have for lunch today...

1268
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,490
is made from a variety of seafood,
such as abalone, flatfish, octopus,

1269
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,090
sea cucumber, and sea squirt.

1270
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,590
(Made with a generous amount
of fresh seafood)

1271
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,930
It's a summer delicacy.

1272
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,760
(The best summer delicacy)

1273
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,500
We prepared cold sashimi soup.

1274
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,200
(Cold sashimi soup,
the most refreshing dish)

1275
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,270
Cold sashimi soup? Nice.

1276
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,870
- You must eat it when on the beach.
- It's the best dish for summer.

1277
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,700
This place has 50 years of history
and is famous for cold sashimi soup.

1278
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,210
- Oh, my. Fifty years?
- They've been serving it for long.

1279
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,510
I wish you all the best
in this round.

1280
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,310
Before we begin the mission
that will determine...

1281
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,150
who will eat cold sashimi soup
and who'll get Defeat Fairy Badges,

1282
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,520
- you'll change the team members.
- Sounds great.

1283
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,490
(It's up to me again.)

1284
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,750
(Avoiding eye contact)

1285
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,660
Joon, can't you leave the team?

1286
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,760
You leave.
Leave and join the other team.

1287
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,560
Can't you expel yourself
from the team?

1288
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,730
Joon, those two have no badges.

1289
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,830
- But we...
- Make them look messy.

1290
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,960
In any case, the members...

1291
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,460
- Joon. I mean...
- We will...

1292
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,830
- I will leave the team.
- What?

1293
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,730
With whom will you switch teams?

1294
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,640
- I will resign from my position.
- Who wants to join his team?

1295
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,010
- You're abandoning us?
- Yes.

1296
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,210
Joon, you should think it through.

1297
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,410
If your team loses again,
you'll be blamed.

1298
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,510
I don't care.

1299
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,950
- I just want to eat food.
- Joon is leaving this team.

1300
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,180
Seon Ho, come here.

1301
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,620
- That sounds good.
- You'll make them lose?

1302
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,620
(They'll be on the same team
as Joon.)

1303
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,950
- That means he'll make them lose.
- Joon.

1304
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,950
But why did you pick me?

1305
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,390
- But this is...
- They have no badges.

1306
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,720
I'll tell you what this is about.

1307
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,490
- This is a fight...
- Gosh. Seon Ho is on our team.

1308
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,590
between Se Yoon and Joon.

1309
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,330
If our team loses
after Joon joins us,

1310
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,760
- Joon will be at fault.
- He'll have three badges.

1311
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,500
But truthfully,
this isn't a fair fight...

1312
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,930
because he gave me the bad ones.

1313
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,600
- How could I win with them?
- They're the bad ones?

1314
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,970
- Either Joon or Se Yoon...
- Right. You'll be blamed.

1315
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,710
will have three badges...

1316
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,210
- at the end of this round.
- That's right.

1317
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,140
- Can we stick to our team name...
- Let's go with Team No Joon.

1318
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,910
- Can we not change our team name?
- Sure.

1319
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,880
I have a feeling that we'll lose
if our team name is Team Lee Joon.

1320
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,220
Since we don't want
to be on Team Lee Joon either,

1321
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,290
how about we name our team
Team Hate Joon?

1322
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,450
(Laughing)

1323
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,860
- We'll go with Team Hate Joon.
- Meaning that we hate Joon.

1324
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,890
- Team Hate Joon?
- Yes, Team Hate Joon.

1325
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,860
- Or as we said goodbye to Joon...
- Team Joon Bye?

1326
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,060
- Okay.
- Team Bye Joon.

1327
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,330
- Team Bye Joon.
- Let's go with that name.

1328
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,360
- Team Bye Joon?
- Team Bye Joon.

1329
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,360
Then we'll be Team Welcome Joon.

1330
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,670
- Team Welcome Joon.
- Yes.

1331
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,670
- Team Welcome Joon.
- Team Welcome Joon. I like it.

1332
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,600
- Then we'll have no choice.
- If we win in this round,

1333
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
it means it wasn't my fault.

1334
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,970
- Yes, that's right.
- That's right.

1335
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,510
- Joon, we'll help you win.
- Of course.

1336
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,540
Yes, thank you.

1337
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,980
- Let's give it a try.
- But...

1338
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,040
- We've got this!
- We've got this!

1339
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,680
- Let's go for it.
- The game you'll play is...

1340
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,320
Stone Flicking
for Gangneung Cold Sashimi Soup.

1341
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,790
The two teams will
take turns attacking.

1342
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,720
The team that survives
until the end wins.

1343
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
- Okay. It's not bad.
- He's good at games like this.

1344
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,430
- I have small skills like that.
- I'm not good at stone flicking.

1345
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,530
- Joon is bad at it.
- I'm bad at it.

1346
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,500
Then we'll start preparing.

1347
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,430
I won't lose three times in a row,
even though I'm unlucky.

1348
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,470
I'm sure I'll win at least once.

1349
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,900
Joon, come over here.

1350
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,170
(What is it?)

1351
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,740
Try to flick a stone like this.

1352
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,810
- Do not make a stone fall...
- Lower your body to align them.

1353
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,640
- And flick it lightly.
- so that we can move it.

1354
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,840
(Joon listens to him carefully.)

1355
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
- Like this.
- Okay.

1356
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,150
You shouldn't flick it
while looking down on it.

1357
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,950
Lower your body
and align your eye level with the stone.

1358
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,320
Then your fingers will
naturally bend...

1359
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,020
- this way.
- Okay. Got it.

1360
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,590
Okay. Let's begin.

1361
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,060
How would you like to decide
the color of the stone you'll use?

1362
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,660
- Can Joon choose the stone first?
- Sure.

1363
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,660
- Would you mind...
- Joon, you choose first.

1364
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,760
The team that chooses
the black stones will decide...

1365
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,330
- whether to go 1st or not.
- The team will go 1st?

1366
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,860
Which one is better?

1367
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,870
It's better to attack first.

1368
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,200
Having the black stones
will be an advantage.

1369
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,400
I'm 100 percent sure that
he chose the white stones.

1370
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,600
- I'm 100 percent sure.
- Ta-da!

1371
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,670
- Good. See? You're lucky now.
- Okay.

1372
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,770
- Now that you're on our team,
- It wasn't my fault.

1373
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,510
- you get positive energy.
- Yes. It wasn't my fault.

1374
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,540
We're at a disadvantage.

1375
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,580
It's cruel.

1376
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,110
The ingredients like abalone
are written on the stones.

1377
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,980
- You've checked the stones, right?
- Yes.

1378
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,980
- There's something written on it.
- We're in trouble.

1379
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,250
Seven ingredients
of cold sashimi soup...

1380
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,950
are written on the stones.

1381
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,620
The losing team...
After the game ends,

1382
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,260
there will be some
of the winning team's stones...

1383
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,930
- left on the board.
- Yes.

1384
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,200
The losing team will have the dish
made from those ingredients.

1385
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,700
So if there are vegetables
and green laver left,

1386
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,830
- they will only have those.
- You understand the rules, right?

1387
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,600
- That's correct.
- You know what it means, right?

1388
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,400
Each team should place
the seven stones you have.

1389
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,400
Got it.

1390
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,240
They can only eat
what's left on the board.

1391
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,670
Green laver would be a good choice.

1392
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,380
So the main ingredients should be
placed in the easy spots to attack.

1393
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,810
- Yes. It's because we...
- Shouldn't this be here?

1394
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:03,810
Okay.

1395
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,210
Wait.
Let's put the vegetable at the back.

1396
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,850
They shouldn't be too far away
from one another.

1397
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,520
Se Yoon, I really want to win this.
I'm so hungry.

1398
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,250
Please.

1399
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,620
Are you good at this game?

1400
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,490
- Shall we begin?
- Are you ready?

1401
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:15,490
- Yes.
- That's good.

1402
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,660
Joon, is our team attacking first
or later?

1403
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,700
- We'll attack 1st.
- Team Welcome Joon will go 1st.

1404
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,700
- Will you? You should go first.
- No, you go ahead.

1405
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,200
- Okay.
- The good player should go first.

1406
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,470
(Focused)

1407
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:26,240
- He seems serious.
- You can't touch it twice.

1408
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,540
- If you touch it, you're out.
- If you touch it, you're out.

1409
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,700
- If you do so, your turn is over.
- No.

1410
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,470
Of course, he won't touch it.
It's okay.

1411
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,340
- The first attack...
- You must not touch it.

1412
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,010
- It's okay. It won't be a problem.
- I'll keep an eye on him.

1413
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,080
- You must not touch it.
- I'm keeping an eye on him.

1414
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,510
(Aiming at the sea cucumber)

1415
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,820
(Sea cucumber)

1416
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,750
(It fell off the board.)

1417
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,390
(He wasted a stone
by making a ridiculous mistake.)

1418
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,390
Okay!

1419
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,790
- What did you just do?
- Are you insane?

1420
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:48,390
- We have our plan.
- Right.

1421
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:49,390
Was that part of the plan?

1422
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:50,730
- Is it going as we planned?
- Okay.

1423
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,960
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min, let's do this.

1424
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

1425
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,460
Let's change our plan.
We'll do whatever we can to win.

1426
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,900
- What?
- Okay! That's good.

1427
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,800
- We just have to win by one point.
- That's right.

1428
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,800
You did well.

1429
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,900
Out.

1430
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,610
- To make that one fall...
- You should push it off the board.

1431
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:05,740
- Hold on. What...
- What's wrong with his hand?

1432
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:08,140
(Sae Ho practically pushed
the stone.)

1433
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,610
- Come on. That wasn't right.
- What's wrong with your hand?

1434
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:10,650
- You get a warning. Hey.
- You get a warning.

1435
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:13,020
- Sae Ho. How could you do this?
- Yes? Why?

1436
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,520
I'm sorry.
I'm just bad at this. That's all.

1437
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,520
Gosh. That was a good opportunity.

1438
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,020
Which one should I hit?

1439
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,860
- Hit the sea squirt with this.
- Exactly.

1440
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,660
- Only then can we...
- My hand should be between them.

1441
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,330
You should hit the sea squirt.

1442
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,660
Hey, you should
hit the sea squirt. Listen to me.

1443
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,230
Don't touch the octopus
before you hit it.

1444
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,330
You should hit the sea squirt.

1445
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,700
Hit it lightly. Don't hit it hard.

1446
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,470
Lightly. You should hit it lightly.

1447
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:32,530
Yes, hit that one.

1448
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,770
Joon, I taught you earlier.

1449
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,570
I taught you earlier.
Align your eye level with the stone.

1450
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,470
- Right. Hit the octopus.
- The green laver or the octopus.

1451
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,440
It's okay if we lose that stone.
So hit it hard.

1452
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,510
Keep your hand off the stone.

1453
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,350
(He plans to hit it hard so that
both will fly off the board.)

1454
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,510
- Keep your hand off it.
- Watch your hand. Lower your body.

1455
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,920
Put this finger horizontally.

1456
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,020
- Oh, gosh. I'm anxious.
- There you go. That's good.

1457
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,320
Now hit it as hard as you can. Go!

1458
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,520
- Great.
- Move aside.

1459
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,990
(He missed the target.)

1460
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,460
- Great.
- Move aside.

1461
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,530
It's Seon Ho's turn.
Go back to your position.

1462
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:02,600
- Oh, is it Seon Ho's turn?
- It's okay.

1463
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,430
Seon Ho, make them both fall off.

1464
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:05,930
- Lower your eye level.
- I'm so nervous right now.

1465
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,670
- Make them both fall off.
- I'm so nervous.

1466
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,710
- Make both of them fall off.
- Both of them should fall off.

1467
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,070
- Make them both fall off.
- Make them both fall off.

1468
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,440
- Make them fall together.
- Seon Ho.

1469
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,710
- Make them fall together. Okay!
- Seon Ho.

1470
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,210
(Their strategy succeeded.)

1471
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,880
- That was good. Good job.
- Did I do well?

1472
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,250
You did well. It's good.
We're winning by one point.

1473
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,720
- It's a bit strange, but it's okay.
- Take your time.

1474
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,250
- Can I make the green laver fall?
- You don't have to...

1475
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,720
Do not rush.

1476
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,190
We just need to win.
That's all that matters.

1477
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:26,220
It's okay. Don't rush.

1478
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,590
- We'll get less food. That's all.
- Hurry up.

1479
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,260
- DinDin made a mistake earlier.
- Yes.

1480
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,590
- He'll make a mistake again.
- This time again?

1481
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,130
He's good at soccer
but not good at using hands.

1482
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,530
He's bad at using his hands.
Look at that.

1483
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,230
- DinDin, don't let them sway you.
- He can't control his hand at all.

1484
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,430
- Okay.
- Okay.

1485
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,770
(Green laver, sea cucumber)

1486
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,430
(Both of the stones
fall off the board.)

1487
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,500
- It's good for us.
- Okay. Nice.

1488
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,510
- Both of them fell off.
- This isn't easy.

1489
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,310
- It's Jong Min's turn.
- Which one will you hit, Jong Min?

1490
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:46,480
I'll make the abalone fall off.

1491
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,840
- You'll make it fall off?
- Of course.

1492
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,340
- Jong Min, it's too risky.
- Jong Min.

1493
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,610
- You can't do that.
- If you succeed, you're the ace.

1494
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,750
- Jong Min.
- Oh, gosh.

1495
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,080
- It's okay.
- I'm so nervous.

1496
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,080
- It's okay. Do whatever you want.
- We'll trust you.

1497
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,150
Okay. I'll move it to the center.

1498
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,120
- Okay.
- You made the right decision.

1499
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,920
It was too far. Something's wrong
about Sae Ho's hand.

1500
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,990
What's wrong with his hand?

1501
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,930
- That's good. Great job.
- Hey, make that one fall off.

1502
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,260
- The abalone? Sounds great.
- Make the abalone fall off.

1503
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,530
I'm sorry. I keep getting cramps.

1504
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:08,530
Be careful not to touch it.
Hit it.

1505
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,000
- Okay!
- That's great.

1506
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,070
(Out)

1507
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:17,070
(What did you just do?)

1508
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,070
I told you to hit it lightly.

1509
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,440
- I tried to make the abalone fall.
- We shouldn't attack.

1510
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,480
Okay!

1511
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,380
It's our turn. You did well.

1512
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,250
- The stone is very light.
- Hit it lightly.

1513
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,350
- Just hit it lightly.
- No, wait.

1514
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,380
- What do you mean it's light?
- That's good.

1515
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,920
- We should block it.
- That's good. Nice.

1516
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,050
Let's defend instead of attacking.

1517
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,890
- Move it just a little.
- Move it close to that one.

1518
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,860
- Move it far away.
- Okay. That's good.

1519
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,890
I'll make it fall off.

1520
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:36,890
- It's not bad.
- Aim carefully.

1521
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:37,990
- This will...
- The stone will bounce.

1522
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,130
- Bounce!
- Bounce!

1523
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:42,200
- DinDin's stone will bounce.
- Don't make them sway you.

1524
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,200
- Don't make them sway you.
- Their trash talk drives me crazy.

1525
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,730
- Don't listen to them.
- Trash talk.

1526
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,970
- Just do it.
- All right.

1527
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,370
Does DinDin have a baby at home?

1528
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,370
He has a kid.

1529
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,910
- Does he have one?
- He has a kid. It's all right.

1530
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,410
(Out)

1531
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:59,250
I don't have a kid!

1532
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:00,950
You lost two stones.

1533
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,220
(DinDin got swayed
by their trash talk.)

1534
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,390
- I'm sorry. I panicked.
- It's okay.

1535
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,650
- You can't push it too hard here.
- No.

1536
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,260
No, they are so bad at this.

1537
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,830
Okay, they flicked their stone.

1538
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:11,090
One more time. Hit it softly.

1539
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,560
- There you go.
- Joon, try this.

1540
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,930
- You should flick it. It's a tie.
- You can do this.

1541
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,030
- We have to get this stone.
- This is what I think...

1542
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,870
Just flick it straight.
Imagine you'll hit these two.

1543
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:19,600
- No, do it however you want it.
- Okay.

1544
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,770
He's going to miss it.
His hand looks weird there.

1545
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:22,870
(Disturbing again
with his trash talk)

1546
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,840
(Losing focus)

1547
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,840
- No Joon.
- No Joon.

1548
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,850
That looks weird. Look.

1549
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,580
- He'll make it bounce.
- There you go.

1550
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,780
Okay!

1551
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:33,820
He's in a rush.

1552
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,020
(Out)

1553
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,350
(This can't be happening.)

1554
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,490
Okay!

1555
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,260
He's so bad at this.

1556
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,430
Let's end this game.
Flick the stone.

1557
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,000
- You can put it next to it.
- Put it next to it.

1558
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,430
Just hit it softly
so they can't hit it hard.

1559
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,930
- All right.
- They won't hit it hard this way.

1560
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,930
- Okay, there you go.
- You got this.

1561
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,240
Can we turn the tables?

1562
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,100
- You can even lose.
- Just hit it.

1563
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,200
Just flick it the way you want.

1564
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,770
It looks like we won. Okay, DinDin.

1565
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:59,140
- Okay.
- We got this.

1566
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,940
But we don't know what will happen
if he hits two stones of ours.

1567
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,250
All right. It's going to end soon.
This is their last chance.

1568
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,450
- It's okay. Just flick it.
- Let's see his last horrible move.

1569
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,150
- He won't hit it well.
- You think you can win this?

1570
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,480
You can have jjamppong all you want.

1571
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,390
(Can he turn the tables?)

1572
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,490
(Please.)

1573
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,490
Flick!

1574
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,260
Flick!

1575
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,590
(Both black and white stones
got eliminated at the same time.)

1576
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,560
- Flatfish and sea squirt.
- Yes, flatfish and sea squirt.

1577
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,430
We got flatfish and sea squirt
at least.

1578
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:22,930
- Nice, we won.
- This is fun.

1579
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:24,700
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

1580
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,870
I couldn't have done it either.

1581
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,500
He lost as soon as
he changed his team.

1582
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,900
This is all because of Joon.

1583
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,310
- Joon loses in every game.
- It's all because of him.

1584
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:32,110
- These guys...
- He's so bad at everything.

1585
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,280
- With just one bad player.
- What is happening?

1586
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,350
Stone Flicking
for Gangneung Cold Sashimi Soup.

1587
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,780
Team Bye Joon won.

1588
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,310
- Yes.
- Yes, Bye Joon!

1589
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,380
- Bye.
- Without Joon, it's all good.

1590
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,750
Joon was the problem.

1591
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,820
My hand didn't feel like my hand.

1592
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,860
It almost felt
as if I was all possessed.

1593
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,390
- You were possessed by Joon.
- I know...

1594
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:49,990
It didn't feel like my own hand
when I played.

1595
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,990
He said he was possessed.

1596
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:52,460
Joon lost in all the games today.

1597
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,860
My goodness.

1598
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,630
I should practice
flicking the stones.

1599
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,000
(Announcing to practice
stone flicking)

1600
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,070
I'm happy at heart.

1601
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:00,370
We'll get you the sashimi soup
that we just prepped.

1602
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:01,700
(Fresh cold sashimi soup is here.)

1603
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,470
- Sea squirt and flatfish are okay.
- We just need flatfish, that's all.

1604
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,070
- It's fine as long as we have it.
- I love flatfish.

1605
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,280
(Amazed)

1606
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:09,810
- This looks crazy.
- My goodness.

1607
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,410
- Gosh.
- This looks so healthy.

1608
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,720
(A blend of various flavors
of the sea)

1609
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,820
This is a lot.

1610
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,250
This looks amazing, My gosh.

1611
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,250
(Premium sashimi soup of Gangneung)

1612
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:19,720
This is huge.

1613
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,590
- This is...
- This is a lot.

1614
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:22,720
Goodness, look at this.

1615
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,330
- Goodness, it's...
- It's huge.

1616
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,700
(Speechless)

1617
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,570
What is this?

1618
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,240
Is this green laver?

1619
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,670
Gosh, this looks so good.

1620
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,670
(Full of bouncy noodles)

1621
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,270
- This looks crazy.
- I'll get yours too.

1622
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:39,410
- I'll get you all the noodles.
- You like them anyway.

1623
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,310
Why would you give me noodles?
Are you joking?

1624
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,280
- I will just finish the whole bowl.
- No! Wait.

1625
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,680
I want the fish too!

1626
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,810
All right.

1627
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,380
Gosh, this is crazy.

1628
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,820
(Taking a sip of the soup)

1629
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:52,750
It's so refreshing.

1630
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,590
This is delicious.

1631
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,660
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1632
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,760
It tastes like an apple.

1633
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,530
It's so good with this fresh fish.

1634
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,610
(Chewy sea cucumber is the best.)

1635
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:11,640
Gosh, this sea cucumber...

1636
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,110
- This is the best.
- You have to eat this for summer.

1637
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,110
(Feeling happy)

1638
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,350
Aren't you giving us our food?

1639
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,480
We'll get Team Welcome Joon's
right now.

1640
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,920
Hey, what is this?
This has no seafood at all.

1641
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,820
- But this is...
- It's almost like a fruit salad.

1642
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,660
(Empty)

1643
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,230
(Trying hard to find edible bits)

1644
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,960
- This isn't bad.
- It isn't bad at all.

1645
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,570
- This is it.
- Try the soup.

1646
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:38,870
- It tastes like young radish.
- The soup is great.

1647
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,200
This soup is actually good.

1648
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,340
(Eating rice with the soup
where there is no seafood)

1649
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,370
This is...

1650
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,740
But this actually tastes good.

1651
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,010
(It is delicious.)

1652
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,010
(However...)

1653
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,150
It doesn't have a lot of texture
without vegetables here.

1654
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,050
- Vegetables make it crunchy.
- I know.

1655
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,390
We need to eat it with vegetables...

1656
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,920
(Looking)

1657
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,690
Is there anything we can do
so that you can help us?

1658
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,560
Is there anything...

1659
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:11,170
(Emotional Se Yoon
is getting softhearted.)

1660
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:15,340
(Is he sharing the sashimi soup?)

1661
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,410
(Is that ours?)

1662
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:20,910
I'll have it.

1663
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:22,310
Hey, come on.

1664
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,150
- All right, then.
- Okay.

1665
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:25,310
- Do you want to have a go?
- Sure.

1666
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,350
This will be a small segment
within the game we're playing.

1667
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,120
It's a small game
within the big game.

1668
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:32,050
(Jong Min's Rushing Game)

1669
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,560
We'll now play
Jong Min's Rushing Game.

1670
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,830
What?

1671
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:37,990
He's never heard of this game.

1672
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,330
- What is it?
- Jong Min's Rushing Game.

1673
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,400
Jong Min's rushing.

1674
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,500
- He'll just rip the toilet paper.
- Right.

1675
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:47,800
You have to guess
whether it's odd or even.

1676
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,170
(Guess whether the ply
of toilet paper is odd or even.)

1677
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:50,740
All right. Jong Min's Rushing Game.

1678
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,940
You can start and rush
for the game while eating.

1679
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,680
All right. We'll rush with the game.
Pay attention.

1680
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,510
Jong Min, take it easy.
You might choke.

1681
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:58,780
I'm okay.

1682
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,120
You will get a stomachache
from having hot and cold dishes.

1683
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,420
- I'm all good.
- You sure?

1684
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,750
(They don't know when Jong Min
will have a stomachache.)

1685
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,520
- It's so delicious.
- I'm just worried.

1686
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,020
(Drinking the soup)

1687
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,360
(Is it now?)

1688
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,800
Gosh, it's so good.

1689
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,230
(This tastes so good.)

1690
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,630
- When are you starting the game?
- What?

1691
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,900
I'll go when I have a stomachache.

1692
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,740
- You don't have a stomachache?
- No.

1693
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,310
I'm worried that
you might have a stomachache.

1694
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,440
You could get a stomachache.

1695
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,080
I don't think he's playing.

1696
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,850
(Drinking the soup again)

1697
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,520
What? What's wrong?

1698
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,990
(Is he having a stomachache?)

1699
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:40,560
Are you having a stomachache?

1700
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,620
What's wrong?

1701
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,990
- Goodness.
- A stomachache?

1702
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,360
What's wrong?

1703
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,430
I told you! He was going
to have a stomachache.

1704
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,170
I knew it was coming.
The game starts now.

1705
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,170
- Should I go?
- Go for it.

1706
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:54,840
(Screaming)

1707
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:56,970
(Paying attention)

1708
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,910
(Rolling)

1709
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:00,940
Your game starts right now.

1710
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,110
All right.

1711
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,580
I don't think we can do this.

1712
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,720
(How can we guess that?)

1713
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,950
Jong Min's Rushing Game has started.

1714
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,990
Is this odd or even? Even or odd?

1715
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,090
(Thinking)

1716
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,130
- Did you pick one, Joon?
- I did.

1717
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:19,460
What's your guess?

1718
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,560
- It's even.
- Even?

1719
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,730
- Odd.
- Odd.

1720
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:23,830
What?

1721
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:24,970
Hold on, Joon.

1722
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:26,470
- Even.
- Even.

1723
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:27,670
- Odd.
- Odd.

1724
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,900
Are you sure it's odd?

1725
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,610
Jong Min, I know you are in a rush.

1726
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:31,970
I need to rush right now.

1727
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:33,640
- Please unroll it.
- All right.

1728
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,710
Let me do it.

1729
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,680
You might not be the problem
if you guess it right this time.

1730
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,720
(It's Joon's chance.)

1731
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,680
- Joon's the only one who said even.
- We'll let him get it.

1732
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,690
Joon's the only one
who said it's even.

1733
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,120
- I'll unfold it now.
- Okay.

1734
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,820
- Odd.
- It's not my fault.

1735
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,020
Even.

1736
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:49,820
Odd.

1737
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,630
Even.

1738
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,060
You can't manipulate
the result of the game.

1739
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,230
Odd.

1740
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,100
- Even.
- Hold on a second.

1741
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,770
- Odd.
- You can't manipulate.

1742
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:58,770
Even.

1743
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,770
Odd, even.

1744
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:03,910
(Joon's getting even more nervous
as Se Yoon's unfolding the paper.)

1745
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:05,310
Even.

1746
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,470
- Unroll it.
- Odd.

1747
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,810
I ripped as it was odd.

1748
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:12,280
This is the rest.
I ripped it on the odd.

1749
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,880
- I'll go now.
- This is getting fun.

1750
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,620
Even.

1751
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,520
You might think that we're wasting
the toilet paper.

1752
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,960
- But we'll use it all.
- I'm wiping my mouth with it.

1753
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:24,530
Odd.

1754
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:27,530
(What?)

1755
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,900
Odd.

1756
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:32,630
Is that one piece?
It's done if he said odd.

1757
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,870
It would be even
if there were two pieces.

1758
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:36,300
Will this be even?

1759
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,440
(What will the result be?)

1760
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:41,580
Even, odd.

1761
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,610
(Odd)

1762
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,650
Odd!

1763
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:47,820
Joon got everything wrong.

1764
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,450
(Joon failed again.)

1765
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:50,520
Joon lost in all the games.

1766
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:53,960
- My goodness.
- How did he lose in all the games?

1767
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,230
- That's crazy.
- Joon is unbelievable.

1768
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,530
(Depressed Joon)

1769
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:01,630
(The other two are trying
the cold sashimi soup without him.)

1770
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,700
Let's try it.

1771
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:10,170
(They dreamed of having
this normal cold sashimi soup.)

1772
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,940
- How is it?
- It's like a different dish.

1773
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,240
- It's different.
- I know.

1774
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,080
- Is it different?
- The texture is different.

1775
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,010
- What is this?
- It's a sea cucumber.

1776
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,480
You don't like sea cucumbers?
Do you want me to eat it for you?

1777
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,480
It's delicious.

1778
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,190
Is it good? I love sea cucumbers.

1779
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,250
This is so good.

1780
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,490
(Nonchalantly giving
his sea cucumber)

1781
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:29,690
Try it.

1782
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,830
- Thank you.
- Cheer up. Get energy from it.

1783
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:32,860
Cheer up after eating it.

1784
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,730
(Cheer up
after eating the sea cucumber.)

1785
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:40,700
This yukhoe is so good.
I haven't had it for a while...

1786
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,070
- Yukhoe?
- What was this called?

1787
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,370
- Cold sashimi soup.
- Cold sashimi soup.

1788
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,440
Did everyone enjoy it?

1789
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,480
- Yes.
- No.

1790
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,050
Joon is surviving.

1791
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:52,210
Thank you.

1792
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,520
All right. Give a round of applause.

1793
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,190
Let's get this through together.

1794
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,150
One, two, three.

1795
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,190
(Clapping)

1796
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,220
Even the sound
of his clap is so small.

1797
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,130
I know. He even missed his clap.

1798
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,730
(Nothing is going well for me.)

1799
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,430
Today has been so fun
because of him.

1800
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,900
My day will come one day.

1801
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,970
I mean to wrap this up...

1802
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,070
I know this week's episode
wasn't all about me.

1803
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:17,570
But thank you for making it
about me.

1804
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,740
I know you wanted me to win.

1805
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,510
They wanted me to win.

1806
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,650
You all cheered me up.

1807
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,650
But I lost in all the games.

1808
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,320
You have to start...

1809
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,680
- to turn the tables now.
- Create a twist now.

1810
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,990
Right?

1811
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:33,190
- This isn't your bad.
- They'll think you're horrible.

1812
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,090
- You have to give it a twist.
- I mean...

1813
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:36,090
People will think you overcame...

1814
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,030
This is all for the show.
I'm not that unlucky in real life.

1815
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,430
Joon, how many badges do you have?
Three?

1816
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,860
- I have 3.
- I got 2.

1817
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,170
They're rivals.

1818
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,330
(Candidates for Defeat Fairy)

1819
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:47,100
Do the 4 of us have 1 badge?

1820
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,770
- Yes.
- Then...

1821
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,810
The important thing
is that Joon gave them to us.

1822
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,670
Joon gave them to us.

1823
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:54,680
It's amazing, isn't it?

1824
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,940
(The Giving Joon)

1825
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,710
We'll get very lucky at one point.

1826
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:59,980
Right? We will, at some point.

1827
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,620
Before arriving
at the next location,

1828
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,520
we'll have the last member change.

1829
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,060
We have to be careful.

1830
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,590
We have to win this time.

1831
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,360
I really have to win.

1832
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,130
I can't say anything if I lose here.

1833
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:14,760
Do what you want.

1834
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,070
Let's be truthful now.

1835
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,340
Who wants to be on a team with me?

1836
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,300
Please raise your hands.

1837
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,370
Where is the spirit you had here?

1838
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:25,410
(Look at this.)

1839
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,810
Where is the spirit you had here?

1840
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,280
Now...

1841
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,680
- This time.
- Joon!

1842
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,720
Bring out the spirit you had here!

1843
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,480
- I used to have a fighting spirit.
- Joon.

1844
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,420
I lost it now.

1845
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,620
I want to be with Joon.

1846
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,920
- Really?
- Yes.

1847
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,260
I want to beat that energy.

1848
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,890
When you cut the flow
of continuous defeats,

1849
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,260
- the person will start winning.
- Right.

1850
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,760
You need to break through it.

1851
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,100
- That's right.
- That's right.

1852
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,930
I experienced a slump once too.

1853
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,240
You fall into it together.

1854
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:55,640
What?

1855
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,110
But...

1856
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,670
You can't get up.

1857
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,880
You'll be dragged into it.

1858
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,640
No. I can lift him up.

1859
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,080
I win.

1860
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:07,320
I win.

1861
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,780
I'm doing this to win.

1862
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,850
(Come to think of it...)

1863
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:13,990
(DinDin has saved several people...)

1864
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:17,190
(with his natural
competitive spirit.)

1865
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,590
Who else did you
make that happen to besides me?

1866
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:20,760
You just say that.

1867
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,460
(Don't you remember, Joon?)

1868
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:28,270
(I made you get the 1st place.)

1869
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,640
(He is in deep thought.)

1870
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,140
I will make my decision.

1871
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,380
He's made up his mind.

1872
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,280
I'll announce the first member.

1873
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,150
- The first member.
- We joined together.

1874
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,850
- It's Cho Sae Ho.
- Okay.

1875
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,320
Let's do this.

1876
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,350
Not bad.

1877
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,990
- It's just like before.
- Let's do this.

1878
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,690
Let's go.

1879
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:49,060
I'll announce the second member.

1880
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:50,790
Trust me.

1881
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:51,890
(Is it DinDin the competitor?)

1882
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,730
I let you eat.

1883
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,160
Im Cheol.

1884
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,200
- Yes!
- What?

1885
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,230
(He chose DinDin.)

1886
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:59,270
Why are you happy?

1887
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:00,840
- I'll show you.
- Really?

1888
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,500
- I'll win for you.
- Why are you happy?

1889
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,110
- I can't tell if he's acting.
- Let's go!

1890
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:11,110
(The last Defeat Fairy match
is waiting for the members.)

1891
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,350
(What mission awaits them?)

1892
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:15,920
Who is on my team?

1893
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,750
- The battleground.
- Why is there a pull-up bar?

1894
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,790
Go, ninja.

1895
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,660
(A mysterious space at the beach)

1896
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,930
- Hold on.
- Wait.

1897
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:25,130
- It's a gym.
- Amazing.

1898
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:26,430
- This is good.
- This is good.

1899
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:28,330
- It's a gym!
- What is that?

1900
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,770
(The view awaiting Lee Joon
beyond the forest)

1901
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:32,930
What is this?

1902
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,970
What is it?

1903
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,410
What is this place?

1904
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:42,680
(It's filled with things
Joon likes.)

1905
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,210
What is this? Is this a gym?

1906
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:47,750
- A gym at the beach?
- A gym.

1907
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,750
This place is amazing.
How could this be here?

1908
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,790
(It makes Joon's eyes widen.)

1909
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:54,090
This is the Muscle Beach
in Gangneung...

1910
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:56,220
where you can enjoy
various workouts...

1911
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,060
while looking at the beach.

1912
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,800
(A famous spot
where you can enjoy them both)

1913
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,030
What is this place? It's amazing.

1914
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:05,870
Can you do pull-ups?

1915
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,470
I can do pull-ups.

1916
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,200
How many can you do?

1917
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,210
(DinDin gives it a try.)

1918
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,340
One.

1919
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,180
Your legs... You have to
fully stretch your arms.

1920
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,910
- Right.
- Why are you giving advice?

1921
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,850
There are people
who always give advice...

1922
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:20,280
- when you go to the gym.
- How many can you do?

1923
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,950
- Basically...
- You should...

1924
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,180
stretch your arm.

1925
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,890
You want me to fully extend it
and then go up?

1926
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,120
You should do five of those.

1927
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,920
Are they showing off
their pull-up skills?

1928
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,790
Gosh. What?

1929
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,530
Gosh.

1930
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,360
(It turns out
he's a workout enthusiast.)

1931
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,630
He does it the textbook way.

1932
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,170
That's true. Gosh.

1933
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,670
- That's true. Gosh.
- He's good.

1934
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,000
- Yangbaechu.
- How refreshing.

1935
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,240
Jong Min...

1936
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,470
- Yangbaechu is good.
- It's refreshing.

1937
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:45,840
- Amazing.
- Did I do well?

1938
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,210
- But he looks very shocked.
- Goodness.

1939
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,950
Joon used to do 100 pull-ups...

1940
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,050
at the gym.

1941
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,150
But the outfit doesn't go with this.

1942
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,580
Right.

1943
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:58,750
Amazing.

1944
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,190
He'd do it easily.

1945
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:02,290
- Gosh.
- The ninja is different.

1946
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,430
(He keeps going steadily
like a machine.)

1947
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,160
He doesn't look tired.

1948
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:09,100
How many can you do?

1949
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:10,430
Nice.

1950
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:12,200
- I do 100 pull-ups.
- Se Yoon!

1951
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:14,270
Yes. Se Yoon.

1952
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:15,800
You can lift this.

1953
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,140
Why show off my strength?

1954
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:19,340
Lifting 3 plates of 20kg isn't easy.

1955
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:21,410
- They're 3 plates of 20kg.
- Se Yoon would do it easily.

1956
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,540
It's 120kg?

1957
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:24,480
- It's 100kg on each side.
- It's okay.

1958
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,510
It's 100kg on each side.

1959
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,880
If I can do this,
Se Yoon will do it easily.

1960
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,080
Se Yoon would just do it.

1961
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:31,020
Hold on.

1962
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,820
You can lift 200kg?

1963
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,760
- He can't do it.
- It's a matter of pride. Do it.

1964
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,290
Joon can't lift that.
How could he lift 200kg?

1965
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:37,430
He would push it.

1966
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,190
(Exclaiming)

1967
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,130
What? Why did you do that?

1968
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:42,200
Hold on.

1969
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,000
He took it as if he normally did it.

1970
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,170
- Hold on.
- Why did you place it?

1971
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,500
Push it!

1972
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,670
(Exclaiming)

1973
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,840
- What are you doing?
- Why did you place 200kg at 1st?

1974
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,740
- Why did he do that?
- You were going to do 120kg.

1975
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,880
Okay.

1976
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,010
(Lifting 120kg is easy.)

1977
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:56,610
If you fail to do this...

1978
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,510
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1979
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,520
What are you doing?

1980
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,050
- Let's go.
- This is right.

1981
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,520
Se Yoon can easily do this.

1982
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:05,490
(Exclaiming)

1983
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:06,950
Goodness.

1984
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,320
Goodness.

1985
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,360
(Strong Se Yoon succeeds
in lifting 120kg.)

1986
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,730
I am in awe.

1987
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,900
He doesn't even work out.

1988
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:22,370
- Stop. You'll get hurt.
- Stop.

1989
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:23,640
Gosh. Stop.

1990
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,970
- That's pure muscle strength.
- Stop.

1991
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,480
I can't do this.

1992
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,410
- Give it a try.
- I can't. How do you do this?

1993
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:31,910
It's so tiresome.

1994
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:33,050
Sae Ho is strong too.

1995
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:34,950
This...

1996
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,880
(Exclaiming)

1997
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,220
(Awkward Beach)

1998
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:41,760
I want to stay here
for about a week.

1999
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,820
I'd just keep working out.

2000
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,490
- It's really nice.
- It's amazing.

2001
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:46,430
(They move for the main mission.)

2002
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:48,030
We won't be getting on that boat,
right?

2003
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,630
- I can't do that.
- I don't like it.

2004
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:50,670
I can't get on that.

2005
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,330
We have to cross over.

2006
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,670
- There are cameras.
- Where?

2007
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:56,740
Here.

2008
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:57,970
(There's a banana hanging.)

2009
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:00,310
- We lost.
- We can't do this.

2010
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:01,540
You did gymnastics, right?

2011
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,910
I did floor exercises.

2012
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,550
Why is my hand swollen?
It's bleeding.

2013
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,050
- Because of the rope?
- It's okay.

2014
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,750
(They found a rope climbing area
on their way.)

2015
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,060
(Sae Ho showed off
his strength and climbed up.)

2016
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:19,260
(It looks like he pushed too hard
and got hurt.)

2017
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,930
- Your hand.
- I'm all right.

2018
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,100
There's a reason
why men die quickly.

2019
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,570
They go crazy
when they see such things.

2020
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,100
- The rope...
- Why are they like that?

2021
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,470
- He couldn't resist it.
- Right.

2022
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,640
I regretted it after doing it.

2023
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,440
- He wanted to show us.
- He's amazing.

2024
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,280
The mission
that will take place here...

2025
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:37,280
is Physical Six.

2026
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,580
I used up all my strength.
Why did you let me do that?

2027
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,550
- No one asked you to do it.
- No one asked you.

2028
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:43,180
(That's true.)

2029
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,420
There will be three rounds.

2030
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:47,960
Rounds 1 and 2...

2031
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,660
each have two Defeat Fairy Badges
on the line.

2032
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,690
- Per round?
- Yes.

2033
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:53,190
That's too much.

2034
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:55,730
Round 3 has 3 badges on the line.

2035
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:57,670
You should do this well.

2036
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,800
- Gosh.
- Okay. All right.

2037
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:01,270
- Two, two, and three?
- Yes.

2038
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:02,400
Goodness.

2039
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:07,710
(It's the last chance
to make up for the defeats so far.)

2040
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,610
(Who will be the official
defeat fairy...)

2041
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,580
(of 2 Days and 1 Night?)

2042
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,920
The mission of round one...

2043
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,150
is Tarzan banana picking.

2044
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:19,650
Each team will start
from opposite sides of the ring.

2045
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,860
You must get the banana
in the middle first.

2046
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,560
- We have to move.
- We should do it like this.

2047
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,060
We should use both hands and swing.

2048
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:31,070
You have to move together.

2049
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,370
Let me try.

2050
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,770
Like that.

2051
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,100
- That's right.
- Yes.

2052
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,740
- Right.
- Go.

2053
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,040
That's right.

2054
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:42,380
You're good.

2055
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,610
(Easily moving)

2056
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:46,110
Don't use up your energy.

2057
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:47,110
(He smoothly touches the last ring.)

2058
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,550
(I got the hang of it.)

2059
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:50,380
We won.

2060
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,250
- I can't do this.
- I can do it.

2061
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:53,920
I can't hang on with just one hand.

2062
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,060
You can't do it like that.
Use the momentum.

2063
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,560
This is as far as it gets.
You should jump.

2064
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,830
Se Yoon!
Stretch your arm before doing it.

2065
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:00,930
He can do it!

2066
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:04,230
(Se Yoon managed to hang on,
fighting through the weight.)

2067
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:05,730
You're like a gorilla.

2068
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:09,240
(Give me the banana.)

2069
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,970
You're like a gorilla!

2070
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,140
(Screaming)

2071
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:14,740
It hurts!

2072
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,910
- It hurts.
- It works.

2073
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:19,580
- It hurts.
- Like an orangutan.

2074
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,220
(Hey.)

2075
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,120
(Round 1: DinDin versus Seon Ho)

2076
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,120
Okay!

2077
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,250
Let's begin!

2078
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:28,620
Ready!

2079
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,360
(Start!)

2080
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:32,630
Let's go, Seon Ho!

2081
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:33,760
Show us, Seon Ho!

2082
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:36,330
(Grabbing)

2083
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,270
(He grabs with momentum
with rhythmic swings.)

2084
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:39,400
(He gets the second ring too.)

2085
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,670
Let's go, Seon Ho!

2086
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:41,770
Show us, Seon Ho!

2087
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,800
(He pulls.)

2088
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,870
- Your left hand.
- Quickly.

2089
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,470
- Quickly, use more momentum.
- Go!

2090
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,310
Quick momentum.

2091
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:53,150
(DinDin and Seon Ho
move at almost the same speed.)

2092
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,020
(Neck-and-neck)

2093
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,220
- You're faster, DinDin.
- Quick momentum.

2094
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,120
- Hurry!
- You can do it. You're faster.

2095
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,060
(The results are unpredictable.)

2096
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,560
Hurry.

2097
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,020
The last one!

2098
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,030
Get it!

2099
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,030
(Will it be DinDin...)

2100
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:07,700
(or Seon Ho?)

2101
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,100
Go!

2102
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,740
(DinDin wins.)

2103
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:24,710
(Did you see my physical ability?)

2104
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:25,850
They were both good.

2105
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:27,580
You're at a disadvantage
because you're tall.

2106
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:28,820
- Right.
- It's because you're tall.

2107
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:31,490
(They're both good.)

2108
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:33,590
(Eating)

2109
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:35,220
It's 1 to 0.

2110
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:38,130
Relax your body, Jong Min.

2111
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:41,530
Grab the first one and relax.
That's right.

2112
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,300
You don't need to go so far.

2113
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,570
- Just grab it.
- Gosh.

2114
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:45,770
(Groaning)

2115
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:49,470
You're going to
master high notes soon.

2116
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,440
Whenever you do something, you go...

2117
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,770
(The number 1 crybaby)

2118
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:54,280
Who should go second?
Should it be me or you?

2119
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,480
- I don't think it'll matter.
- Right.

2120
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,610
Anyone will be able to win.

2121
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:00,210
All right. Let's begin
with the second players.

2122
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:06,790
He has the body of a male servant
from the past.

2123
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:08,890
(Sturdy)

2124
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,720
- Don't go too fast. Check on me.
- Okay.

2125
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,890
(Okay. I'll take it easy.)

2126
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:13,790
- We'll begin!
- I feel nervous, though.

2127
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,600
Relax.

2128
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,960
- Relax.
- Get ready.

2129
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,530
Jump at the start.

2130
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:21,100
Okay.

2131
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,800
(Jong Min grabs the first ring
with a jump.)

2132
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,140
Relax. Pull your left arm.

2133
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:27,440
Oh, gosh!

2134
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,210
There you go. Nice.

2135
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,680
You won, Sae Ho.

2136
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:33,980
You're looking light.

2137
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,720
(Sae Ho is in the lead.)

2138
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,980
- Sae Ho is good.
- But if you lose,

2139
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:39,020
we'll witness a great scene
with Se Yoon.

2140
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:40,750
(Please win.)

2141
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,290
(No. Please lose.)

2142
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:45,160
(Jong Min tries to do his best
while enjoying the game,)

2143
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,800
(but Sae Ho is a lot faster.)

2144
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,400
(Pacing...)

2145
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,870
(forward)

2146
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,100
(Sae Ho grabs the last ring first.)

2147
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:57,610
(No!)

2148
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:58,710
Gosh, Sae Ho won.

2149
01:08:58,710 --> 01:08:59,940
(This is easy.)

2150
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,680
(What?)

2151
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,410
(He just needs to get
the banana to win.)

2152
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,290
(Slipping)

2153
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:13,290
(He missed it!)

2154
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:15,790
(Grabbing)

2155
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:19,560
(He barely manages
to get the banana.)

2156
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,360
- I almost missed it.
- Nice one.

2157
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,700
We had to win.

2158
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,300
We have to bring them down quickly.

2159
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,600
Gosh!

2160
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,070
I didn't even get a chance!

2161
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,210
(Thank you so much.)

2162
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:35,210
All right.

2163
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,380
Jong Min still did pretty well.

2164
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,580
We have to bring them down quickly.

2165
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,920
Should we have an extra game
before ending it like this?

2166
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,120
We should go for an extra game.

2167
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,890
(I thought I was going to
get away from it.)

2168
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,890
We have to watch Joon's match.

2169
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,360
(Meanwhile...)

2170
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,860
Why are you eating so many bananas?

2171
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,900
He had two bananas.

2172
01:09:57,670 --> 01:09:59,030
Well, it's for the match.

2173
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:00,130
Right.

2174
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:05,070
How does this sound, Joon?

2175
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,410
Can't you take off your top
and just wear the overalls?

2176
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:09,610
Let's go with that.

2177
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:11,950
- I haven't been working out.
- Let's take off the top.

2178
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,810
- I'm out of shape.
- Let's show everyone.

2179
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,750
- I lost a lot of muscles.
- Let's see.

2180
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:17,790
No. You look great right now.

2181
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:18,890
I lost...

2182
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:22,190
(On the hot beach,)

2183
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,490
(there's an even hotter man.)

2184
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,100
(He transforms into the muscular guy
with overalls.)

2185
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,810
- Gosh, it's Muscular Joon.
- Gosh.

2186
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:41,010
It's been around 30 years
since I've hung onto something.

2187
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,310
(Event match: Joon versus Se Yoon)

2188
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:46,650
Get ready.

2189
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,780
Set.

2190
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:52,020
Go! Show them that you can win,
Se Yoon.

2191
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,390
(Moving freely)

2192
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,630
It's the muscular guy!

2193
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:01,560
- He feels light.
- It's the muscular guy!

2194
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,330
(Where is this guy?)

2195
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,430
(The sightseeing guy watches
the muscular guy on the other side.)

2196
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,240
(Bring it on.)

2197
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,570
Wait, Joon.

2198
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:10,970
- Just come down.
- Go, Se Yoon!

2199
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:12,510
- Wait.
- Just come down.

2200
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,780
(If that's what you want...)

2201
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,420
(What is he doing?)

2202
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,950
Hurry over!

2203
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,950
What's wrong with him?

2204
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,760
Gosh!

2205
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:31,960
- Hey!
- Come on!

2206
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,460
This is so humiliating.
I don't want to do this.

2207
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:34,660
I don't want to do this!

2208
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,960
Let's go, Se Yoon! Show us!

2209
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,330
Show us what you've got!

2210
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:42,040
(I will show you.)

2211
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,400
- "I'm a gorilla!"
- Gosh.

2212
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:45,910
- "I'm a gorilla!"
- Gosh.

2213
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:47,040
(Se Yoon grabs the first ring.)

2214
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,210
Show us. There you go.

2215
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:50,740
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2216
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,650
(What is going on?)

2217
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:58,050
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2218
01:11:58,450 --> 01:11:59,750
Gosh! That hurt!

2219
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:00,750
(Hitting)

2220
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,590
(I did my best.)

2221
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,320
(Groaning)

2222
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:06,790
(Se Yoon gives up.)

2223
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,900
(Are you not coming?)

2224
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,430
Gosh, look at his back.

2225
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:13,570
- Gosh!
- Muscular Joon!

2226
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:21,410
(He does everything he wants
at this moment.)

2227
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:22,410
Gosh, Joon!

2228
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,450
This is the reason
men die faster than women.

2229
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:26,680
What is wrong with him?

2230
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,750
(The Muscular Joon Show)

2231
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,350
Your foot is going to slip!

2232
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:32,390
(How do I look?)

2233
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,160
(After putting on a show,
he takes the win with the banana.)

2234
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,560
You look great.
You did well to wear these.

2235
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,000
(He ends it with another banana.)

2236
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,600
That's his third banana.

2237
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,570
- All right.
- I didn't have much for lunch.

2238
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,940
- You're going to gain weight.
- For Round One,

2239
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:50,070
in the Tarzan Banana Picking game,

2240
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:52,340
Team Bye Joon loses.

2241
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,670
- Okay.
- Nice one.

2242
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,680
You're great at this.

2243
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,380
(Defeat Fairy Badge Count)

2244
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,850
(Se Yoon 4, Seon Ho 3, Sae Ho 1,
Jong Min 3, Joon 3, DinDin 1)

2245
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:01,650
- Okay!
- It's ssireum.

2246
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:03,550
Ssireum? I'm terrible at it.

2247
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:04,690
I don't know how to do it either.

2248
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:06,790
- All right, everyone.
- This is too much.

2249
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:08,790
- This is the second mission.
- It's definitely ssireum.

2250
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:11,390
It's the Ssireum Champion Battle.

2251
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:13,060
- Gosh.
- Right. This is our game.

2252
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,960
Please decide on the order
of the players.

2253
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,970
Are you good at ssireum, Joon?

2254
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:19,570
I've never tried it.
Maybe just once.

2255
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:20,600
- Let's give it a try.
- All right.

2256
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,740
I have no skills at all.

2257
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,640
Joon has never tried ssireum.
You can beat him.

2258
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,010
- How?
- So...

2259
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,340
You should trip the inside
or outside of his leg.

2260
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:28,340
- Right.
- Or you should do the leg pull.

2261
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:29,380
Because you're weaker.

2262
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,510
You use your weight with this one.

2263
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:33,280
There's one like this too.

2264
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,320
Since he's light,

2265
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,580
just lift him up...

2266
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,250
- and just push him over.
- Okay.

2267
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,620
- Right at the start.
- Okay.

2268
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,220
Tripping him from the
inside of his leg is the andari.

2269
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:43,260
Right. I know that much.

2270
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,690
It's not about pushing his belly.

2271
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:46,090
You have to trip him
from the top of his shoulder.

2272
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:47,330
(Push his shoulder
after tripping his leg!)

2273
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:49,030
- You get it, right?
- Okay.

2274
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:51,570
We'll start with the first players
of each team.

2275
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:52,600
Enter!

2276
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,930
- He's up already.
- What?

2277
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,370
It's a battle of muscles.

2278
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:56,900
(Team Bye Joon's number 1,
Yoo Seon Ho)

2279
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,110
- What?
- What?

2280
01:13:58,110 --> 01:14:00,170
Fashion muscles
against paper muscles.

2281
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,910
Greet each other.

2282
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:07,920
Each player will say something
before we start.

2283
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:10,950
- I'll end things in 10 seconds.
- "I'll end things in 10 seconds."

2284
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:12,290
I will try to stay alive
for 11 seconds.

2285
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:13,950
Okay. That was great.
Get down on your knees.

2286
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,590
- How is it done?
- Get down on your knees.

2287
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:18,960
Get closer. You have to get
each other's satbas.

2288
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:20,890
The satba. Grab onto it.

2289
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:23,060
These two
have never tried ssireum before.

2290
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,670
You know how to grab the satba,
right?

2291
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:25,930
- I don't.
- You don't?

2292
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,400
- I'll help you.
- Put it in here.

2293
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,500
- Here.
- Please tighten it for me.

2294
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,470
- Put your hand here.
- The other way.

2295
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:34,040
Gosh! Hold on.

2296
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,240
You have to hold it like this.

2297
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,610
- It hurts so much.
- Like this. Okay.

2298
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:38,510
- It has to be held like this.
- I can't!

2299
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,210
Get up after the count.

2300
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:42,550
Get your left knee up.

2301
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,120
Get your left knee up! Get up!

2302
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,850
- It hurts!
- Get up.

2303
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:49,020
- It hurts so much.
- Get up!

2304
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,890
- What's going on?
- He won!

2305
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,730
(Seon Ho wins?)

2306
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:54,530
- What is going on?
- Let go of it.

2307
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:56,900
- Let's just let them stand.
- Okay.

2308
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,100
Okay. All right.

2309
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,330
Push back. Get into position.

2310
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,000
You know what to do, right?
We will start now.

2311
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,240
Get ready.

2312
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,070
Go!

2313
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:06,140
Flip him over!

2314
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,740
(The first ssireum match starts!)

2315
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:08,940
Flip him over!

2316
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,550
(Joon uses his strength
right from the start.)

2317
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:16,550
- Seon Ho, keep your balance!
- Go for the leg!

2318
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:20,390
(Joon's only skill
learned from DinDin)

2319
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,720
(Hang in there, Seon Ho!)

2320
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:27,590
(Seon Ho held out
through Joon's attack.)

2321
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:28,800
Use his strength!

2322
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,630
(He goes in for the andari.)

2323
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:34,970
Go up! The andari!

2324
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,540
- He won.
- The andari!

2325
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:37,940
The andari!

2326
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,810
- He won.
- The andari!

2327
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:42,980
(Seon Ho unexpectedly
brought down Joon.)

2328
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,650
- The andari!
- What just happened?

2329
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:46,850
(Yoo Seon Ho wins with the andari!)

2330
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:49,450
What? He lost.

2331
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,620
(Joon goes through another loss.)

2332
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,990
(Se Yoon and Seon Ho's strategy
got them the win.)

2333
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,520
The andari worked.

2334
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,860
- I don't know how it's done.
- There's sand on your face.

2335
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,100
- Nice one.
- Yes!

2336
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,330
All right, everyone.
We'll have the second players now.

2337
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,070
- You two have experience.
- Right.

2338
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:09,270
Please get the satbas on your own.
- Right.
- Right.

2339
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,970
The game ends
if Jong Min wins this round.

2340
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:15,040
- Right.
- DinDin is the last player?

2341
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,210
Why push me?

2342
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:17,840
Okay!

2343
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,810
(Quarreling)

2344
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:23,380
- That's too much, sir!
- Gosh.

2345
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,250
The other way around! I can't see!

2346
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,390
- Hold on.
- What is this?

2347
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:29,090
- Sir. Hold on.
- We should face the other way.

2348
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:30,460
We should face the other way.

2349
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,760
Loosen up a bit.

2350
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,530
- Okay.
- Like this?

2351
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:35,330
- Come this way a bit.
- Is this right?

2352
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:37,400
Are you ready?

2353
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:39,570
Let's begin. Grab it well.

2354
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:41,570
All right. Ready. Let's begin.

2355
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:43,800
- Okay. Start.
- Let's begin.

2356
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,910
(The match starts!)

2357
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:47,910
Wait. Don't try too hard.
Don't waste your energy too soon.

2358
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:50,510
Jong Min. Good.

2359
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:52,450
- My gosh. He won.
- What?

2360
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:53,950
- I threw him down.
- He threw him down.

2361
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,520
Jong Min. Good.

2362
01:16:55,580 --> 01:17:00,220
(The two fell
almost at the same time.)

2363
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:01,820
Sae Ho took him down.

2364
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:02,860
(Which one of them fell first?)

2365
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,890
(Without caring
about what Jong Min said,)

2366
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:08,930
(he carefully took some steps...)

2367
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:11,130
(and tried
the abdomen throw right away.)

2368
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:13,770
(Jong Min's hand
touched the ground first.)

2369
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:18,170
- I threw him down.
- He threw him down.

2370
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:19,670
- Cho Sae Ho wins.
- Yes!

2371
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:21,440
- Okay.
- Sae Ho, you were so cool.

2372
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,910
- All right.
- That was cool.

2373
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:24,310
Gosh.

2374
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,450
- Jong Min, what did you do?
- My gosh.

2375
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:27,550
He's not hurt, right?

2376
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,150
I'll give you a chance.

2377
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:30,880
(Shameless)

2378
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,420
- That was really cool.
- How?

2379
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,690
- All right. The last match.
- Already...

2380
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:35,020
- I lifted and turned him like this.
- Then...

2381
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,390
I should give him a chance.

2382
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:39,230
I'll give Se Yoon a chance
to make a contribution.

2383
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:41,630
Se Yoon, it's your call.
What do you want me to do?

2384
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,030
- What?
- What do you want me to do?

2385
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:44,600
- I'll do what you want.
- Okay.

2386
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:46,770
You know what it will be like
if you lose, right?

2387
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,440
What is it you want?

2388
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,740
Let's just do it properly.

2389
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,670
- Shall I use only one hand?
- Let's just do it properly.

2390
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,710
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

2391
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,980
In the center.

2392
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,710
(The third round,
Se Yoon versus DinDin)

2393
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:02,080
(What is DinDin's strategy?)

2394
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,480
Get ready.

2395
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,690
- It's the last round.
- It really hurts.

2396
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:07,350
It's 1 to 1 now.

2397
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:08,860
Start.

2398
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,560
(DinDin is imagining
a miraculous victory.)

2399
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:15,060
Okay.

2400
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,030
(But he soon ends up
facing an upside-down world.)

2401
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,570
Don't do that.

2402
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,740
(My boy.)

2403
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:30,940
Don't do that. Stop it!

2404
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,580
(A scene that you can
rarely see in a ssireum match)

2405
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,280
- My gosh!
- We don't know it yet.

2406
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,750
We don't know it yet.

2407
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:39,020
(DinDin tries to do something.)

2408
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:42,290
(But nothing works.)

2409
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:47,730
Don't be like this. Stop it.

2410
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:49,260
Moon Se Yoon wins!

2411
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,370
Don't do that.

2412
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:54,430
(He almost cried.)

2413
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:56,040
We lost.

2414
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:58,240
(Team Bye Joon wins!)

2415
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,840
We enjoyed the mockery match.

2416
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:02,040
This is the last round now.

2417
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,280
Thank you, DinDin.

2418
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,910
(Now they have
only the last round left.)

2419
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:06,380
(Current Number
of Defeat Fairy Badges)

2420
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:07,780
(Lee Joon, 5, Se Yoon, 4, Jong Min, 3,
Sae Ho, 3, DinDin, 3, Seon Ho, 3)

2421
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,780
Actually, this is...

2422
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,550
a battle between Se Yoon and Joon.

2423
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:13,190
- That's right.
- We're safe.

2424
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:14,860
Still, we should do our best.

2425
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,290
- Let's still try to win.
- Right.

2426
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,020
We shouldn't take it easy.

2427
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:20,660
Let's begin Round Three,
the last round.

2428
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,960
The first player
to reach the finish line...

2429
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,430
after turning the halfway point...

2430
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:26,770
while dragging a 20kg tire wins.

2431
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:29,740
- Is it 20kg?
- Yes.

2432
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:31,870
- You won't try hard, will you?
- No.

2433
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:33,010
- I'll try hard.
- You should win.

2434
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:35,940
- Okay.
- Whom should I play with to win?

2435
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,180
No one is easy to beat.

2436
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,850
We can't tell who will win
because of the tire.

2437
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:41,410
A tire of 20kg is too light.
It should be 100kg.

2438
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:42,880
I want to see how it feels.

2439
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:48,290
(Seon Ho checks the weight,
and the tire doesn't move at all.)

2440
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,460
Jong Min, I'm serious.
It's not moving.

2441
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:53,130
Let me see.

2442
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,830
It's not light.

2443
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:57,000
No, it's not light.

2444
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:58,900
It might work
to Se Yoon's advantage.

2445
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:02,370
(Between Se Yoon and Joon,
who will be the Defeat Fairy?)

2446
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:03,800
The first players.

2447
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:07,470
- It's Yoo Seon Ho.
- Good.

2448
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,110
- DinDin for us.
- DinDin versus Yoo Seon Ho.

2449
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:11,140
(It's a match
between Seon Ho and DinDin.)

2450
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,580
- Try your best.
- The first players.

2451
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,150
Please.

2452
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,380
Seriously, I want you to survive.

2453
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,390
(I want you to survive,
my colleague.)

2454
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:19,390
This time.

2455
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:20,450
- It's hard.
- Let's begin.

2456
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:22,120
- Let's go, Seon Ho.
- I'll try my best anyway.

2457
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,260
- All right.
- Make it short.

2458
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,190
- Make it short.
- This is the last round.

2459
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:26,290
(DinDin looks relaxed?)

2460
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:27,760
Ready.

2461
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:29,830
Start.

2462
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,130
- Go, Seon Ho!
- There you go!

2463
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:35,570
(Seon Ho's youthful get-up-and-go?)

2464
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:38,100
(DinDin's speed trained by running?)

2465
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:40,710
- Go, Seon Ho!
- There you go!

2466
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,510
What? DinDin is really weak.

2467
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:44,010
- Didn't you run?
- My gosh.

2468
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:47,780
(He runs unbelievably fast
while dragging a tire.)

2469
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,680
(Meanwhile, DinDin is struggling.)

2470
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,520
What? DinDin is really weak.

2471
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,090
- DinDin.
- Didn't you run?

2472
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:56,460
What? DinDin is really weak.

2473
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:57,760
Didn't you run?

2474
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:01,190
(Seon Ho arrives
at the halfway point first.)

2475
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:02,730
Seon Ho, hurry.

2476
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:04,130
Run, Seon Ho!

2477
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:07,200
Seon Ho! Until the end!
Clench your teeth!

2478
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,740
(Seon Ho runs with clenched teeth
for Se Yoon.)

2479
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:11,810
(Seon Ho is still winning.)

2480
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:16,010
(While trying to cheat,
DinDin falls alone.)

2481
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:18,480
- Hey, don't give up.
- Clench your teeth!

2482
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,850
Thanks. Hurry. He's coming.

2483
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:22,480
(DinDin gets back up,)

2484
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,350
(but Seon Ho is already
reaching the finish line.)

2485
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:25,590
Is it hard?

2486
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:27,390
It seems hard.

2487
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,460
You should lift it up a little.

2488
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:31,190
When you drag it,
the sand goes into the tire.

2489
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:33,190
- It gets heavier with the sand.
- This is...

2490
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:36,230
Sand goes into the tire like this.

2491
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:37,630
(Sand falls from the tire.)

2492
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:39,770
- We should get rid of the sand.
- It doesn't move because of it.

2493
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:40,830
The sand is too heavy.

2494
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:42,440
Let's move the tire.

2495
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:44,840
Should I move it?

2496
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:50,340
(He must do it himself.)

2497
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:51,750
Yes. Please do it.

2498
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,510
Thanks, Seon Ho.

2499
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:55,650
Se Yoon, I tried my best.

2500
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:57,350
(Seon Ho tried his best
for his teammate.)

2501
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,090
(The second match,
Jong Min versus Sae Ho)

2502
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:00,550
No, you can't do that.

2503
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:03,390
Hey, if you do that,
I'll make it shorter.

2504
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:04,790
I can have it around my body
like this, can't I?

2505
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:06,030
- You can do that.
- Jong Min.

2506
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:08,160
- You lost the ssireum match.
- Yes.

2507
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,230
Will you lose again?

2508
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,260
Okay.

2509
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,570
I bet Sae Ho is good.

2510
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:14,030
Sae Ho is great at things like this.

2511
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:15,540
You have to win this one
to have the final match.

2512
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:16,740
- Okay.
- All right.

2513
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,310
Good luck, Sae Ho.

2514
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:19,640
(If Sae Ho loses, Joon will be
the Defeat Fairy right away.)

2515
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,410
- Please, Jong Min.
- Ready.

2516
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:22,580
- Please.
- Good luck, Sae Ho.

2517
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:24,840
Jong Min, please.

2518
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:26,880
Start.

2519
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,920
- Go.
- Cho Sae Ho is winning.

2520
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:34,190
(Sae Ho with overwhelming speed)

2521
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:36,420
(Sae Ho...)

2522
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:39,290
(Jong Min is just loud.)

2523
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:40,730
Pull it harder with your arms.

2524
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:44,000
There's no way he will win.

2525
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,840
(Sae Ho passes
the halfway point first.)

2526
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,670
- My gosh.
- He's fast.

2527
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:52,840
- My goodness.
- He looks so ugly.

2528
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:55,310
His face...

2529
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:58,080
(Sae Ho wins
with an overwhelming gap.)

2530
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,380
It's so hard. I'm tired.

2531
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:03,220
He doesn't try hard at all
since this isn't about him.

2532
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,420
He's unbelievable.

2533
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:07,750
He's unbelievable.

2534
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,320
- Joon.
- Thank you, Sae Ho.

2535
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:13,290
You were outstanding.

2536
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,200
- Gosh, it's heavy.
- So this is...

2537
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:17,830
the match to decide
on the Defeat Fairy.

2538
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,430
- That's true.
- It's not my fault!

2539
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,640
They have to do this themselves.

2540
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:29,140
I have only one shot left.
The last one.

2541
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:32,110
- Let's do this.
- What's with Joon's eyes?

2542
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:35,580
(The two of them
somehow became serious.)

2543
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:39,590
(A match that they can never lose)

2544
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:42,690
- You can do this!
- This is the final.

2545
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:44,290
It determines the results
of all the matches we had today.

2546
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,790
- Let's do this.
- What's with Joon's eyes?

2547
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:48,360
- He looks determined.
- Ready.

2548
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:50,960
Go, Se Yoon! My gosh.

2549
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,730
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

2550
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:54,730
- Se Yoon...
- My goodness.

2551
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,940
Go, Se Yoon! My gosh.

2552
01:23:56,940 --> 01:24:00,640
(As soon as the whistle blows,
Se Yoon speeds up fiercely.)

2553
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:05,510
(Se Yoon has no intention
of losing.)

2554
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:10,220
(Running at full speed)

2555
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:12,850
(He's slightly ahead of Joon.)

2556
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:14,720
(Joon chases after him diligently.)

2557
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,690
(Meeting at the halfway point)

2558
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:22,360
(A fierce and desperate
confrontation)

2559
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,730
Go. We don't know it yet.

2560
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:28,170
(A physical fight
where no one gives in)

2561
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:29,840
Let's start over
and play fair and square.

2562
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:30,940
Fair and square.

2563
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:33,910
- Se Yoon is unbelievable.
- Se Yoon, you were really fast.

2564
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:35,010
- Here.
- Se Yoon.

2565
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,040
(A short break)

2566
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,040
Se Yoon.

2567
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,050
- Get ready.
- You were really fast.

2568
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:42,550
- Where is it?
- Se Yoon is amazing.

2569
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:44,120
Se Yoon, you got there first.

2570
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,120
Your tire has a lot of sand in it.

2571
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:47,690
Make it short.

2572
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:49,360
- Are you ready?
- Just get here, and it's over.

2573
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,090
- Ready.
- You're almost there.

2574
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:53,590
- Start.
- Lean and run.

2575
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:55,530
- Who will get here first?
- Please!

2576
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:57,130
Who will get here first?

2577
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:59,470
(Almost at the same speed)

2578
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:03,870
(To avoid becoming
the Defeat Fairy,)

2579
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:06,870
(they have a fierce final showdown.)

2580
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:10,780
(How will this showdown end?)

2581
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:14,250
(Se Yoon staggers at that moment.)

2582
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:17,450
(Meanwhile, Joon doesn't waver.)

2583
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,260
It's downhill here.

2584
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,530
Right. This part is difficult.

2585
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:29,000
You were almost there.

2586
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,400
(Se Yoon is the Defeat Fairy.)

2587
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:33,630
It's not because of me!

2588
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:35,200
It's not my fault!

2589
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:38,740
That was a big match.

2590
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:40,840
I'll give him some water.
Have one more sip.

2591
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,340
Se Yoon. Have some water.

2592
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,540
Pour it.

2593
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:48,720
All the matches were neck-and-neck.

2594
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:50,050
It was fun today.

2595
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:51,850
- It was a good game.
- It was a close match.

2596
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:52,920
- Yes.
- My gosh.

2597
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,260
The result
of the Defeat Fairy Pageant.

2598
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:59,730
Se Yoon has become
the official Defeat Fairy...

2599
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:00,830
of 2 Days and 1 Night.

2600
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,360
Joon is so lucky.

2601
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,630
- I...
- You did a good job.

2602
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:04,930
- Well done.
- One thing I regret is...

2603
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:07,000
Today, during the shoot,

2604
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:10,000
I wish I hadn't played
the 1st 2 games with Joon.

2605
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,710
I would've survived if I weren't
on the same team as him.

2606
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,580
- Then you would've survived.
- That's...

2607
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,240
- Right.
- That was unfortunate.

2608
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,850
(Unfortunately,
he was stuck with Joon.)

2609
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,280
Actually, we got all the badges...

2610
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,850
because of you today.

2611
01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:24,050
That's true.

2612
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:25,490
- I got this because of Joon.
- You're right.

2613
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:27,950
All right. Thank you for today.

2614
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:29,390
- Right.
- Se Yoon.

2615
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:32,760
After the shoot is over tomorrow,

2616
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:35,830
You'll remain alone
on the beautiful Gangneung beach...

2617
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:38,100
to compete against civilians.

2618
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,130
Compete in what?

2619
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:40,200
- And...
- What?

2620
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,670
- What?
- He's really shy.

2621
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:45,070
You can't go home until you win.

2622
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:47,110
Will he come back
to the Muscle Beach to drag this...

2623
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:48,610
and hang onto that and stuff?

2624
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:50,740
- For real?
- Yes.

2625
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,350
- What's that?
- That's really tough.

2626
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:57,780
- Let's head to the base camp.
- Let's go.

2627
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,350
I can barely stand in the sand.

2628
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:00,350
I'm exhausted.
(The 1st Defeat Fairy Pageant
ends successfully.)

2629
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:03,320
- Are we going to the base camp?
- That's right.

2630
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,660
- I'm hungry.
- Okay.

2631
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,060
I used too much energy.

2632
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,060
(They gave their all on Physical 6.)

2633
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:10,230
(This guy is almost out of it.)

2634
01:27:10,530 --> 01:27:12,170
It's just 7 p.m. for the viewers.

2635
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:14,000
(I must get a grip.)

2636
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:17,140
I must think of
what to compete in tomorrow.

2637
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:19,140
(The Defeat Fairy
will stay behind tomorrow.)

2638
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:21,670
I hope you wrap up
and go home at 6 a.m.

2639
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:22,910
(He wants to send them home,
finish quickly, and leave.)

2640
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:25,080
You can't go home
if you keep losing.

2641
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:27,980
Forget that.
Just standing still in the sand...

2642
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:29,750
That's a tough fight.

2643
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:30,880
You're competing against yourself.

2644
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:32,650
Sleep well tonight.

2645
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:33,820
Go on home first.

2646
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:35,760
Go home before I send you.

2647
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,060
(Turning evil)

2648
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,290
Jong Min.

2649
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:39,430
Okay, thanks.

2650
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:40,860
(He looks out for the eldest.)

2651
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:42,760
Jong Min can go.

2652
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:43,830
If you don't want to be sent.

2653
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:48,000
Let's get moving, guys.

2654
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:50,000
It's a hanok village.

2655
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,400
This is where we're staying?

2656
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,440
- The lodgings...
- This is our base camp?

2657
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:55,910
It's the best ever.

2658
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:57,740
It looks like Gyeongbokgung Palace.

2659
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,010
It's a nice place to sleep outdoors.

2660
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:02,080
This is insane.

2661
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:07,220
(Mount Jewang
surrounds the cozy hanok.)

2662
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,660
- Is anyone home?
- This is incredible.

2663
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:09,790
Look at the mountain in the back.

2664
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:11,920
It's picturesque.

2665
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:13,690
The air too.

2666
01:28:13,690 --> 01:28:15,130
(They exclaim in awe
as they go indoors.)

2667
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:16,330
It's fantastic.

2668
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,970
I saw something on social media.

2669
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,770
If you put this on your face
and trace with a marker,

2670
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:24,200
you get a caricature.

2671
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,200
You do?

2672
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,240
Give it a go.

2673
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:28,540
Put this on your face like this.

2674
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:29,910
- You trace his features?
- Like this?

2675
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:31,340
- Yes.
- No way.

2676
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:33,050
Won't you poke a hole?

2677
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:34,980
- No.
- Can't he hold it still?

2678
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,350
I don't see how this works.

2679
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:38,720
Does this make sense?

2680
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,890
- It's nonsense.
- It's nonsense.

2681
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:42,190
- No way.
- It must feel weird.

2682
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:43,490
No, it's fine.

2683
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:45,020
This is a bit...

2684
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:46,260
(The artistic little finger)

2685
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,060
- Isn't it suffocating?
- It's not.

2686
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:50,630
I'm watching the process,

2687
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:51,700
and it's not like him at all.

2688
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:53,600
- It's fine.
- It kind of looks like him.

2689
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,930
- For real?
- This works?

2690
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:55,940
This works?

2691
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:58,440
- No, isn't that silly?
- It makes no sense.

2692
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:59,470
Is this how you do it?

2693
01:28:59,470 --> 01:29:00,570
It looks weird.

2694
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:01,570
That works?

2695
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:03,380
This is nonsense.

2696
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:05,140
I see Jong Min in it, though.

2697
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:07,810
- I think it's working.
- Hang on.

2698
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:10,820
Do you think anyone would look good?

2699
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:11,880
You don't know what to do, do you?

2700
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,350
No. This is what they did.

2701
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:17,220
- Gosh.
- It's kind of like him.

2702
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:19,190
- I see Jong Min.
- It's a good likeness.

2703
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:20,390
I see him in it.

2704
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:23,300
(You can't deny the likeness.)

2705
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:25,700
- What is this?
- What is this, anyway?

2706
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,900
- I saw it online.
- This works?

2707
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:29,240
I'll take this off.

2708
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,040
- The space...
- Is this how it's done?

2709
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,040
(How will it come out?)

2710
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,270
Don't make me ugly on purpose.

2711
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:34,840
No, I'm tracing it identically.

2712
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,040
Just trace his features.

2713
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:39,650
- I see you in the drawing.
- Me too.

2714
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:41,210
Hang on. Hold it up.

2715
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:42,280
Keep it still.

2716
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,880
There are no kids,
and we're still having fun.

2717
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:45,490
How good is it?

2718
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:46,550
(Glancing)

2719
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:49,190
- Hey. Darn you.
- Wait. I need to trace your face.

2720
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:51,660
It's so him.

2721
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:54,830
(They complete Sae Ho
and Joon's caricatures too.)

2722
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:56,700
- Everyone.
- What's that?

2723
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,630
- My gosh.
- What's that?

2724
01:29:58,630 --> 01:29:59,630
(Director Joo appeared
from behind the door?)

2725
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:01,630
- Why? What?
- What's that for?

2726
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:04,070
- You had a rough time.
- We didn't ask for this.

2727
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:05,100
- For real?
- For real?

2728
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,740
- Yes.
- It's really for us?

2729
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,840
- Guys, look.
- What is it?

2730
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:11,380
- Why?
- No. We can't eat it.

2731
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:13,610
- We had one.
- Don't eat, then.

2732
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,550
You're free to eat this.

2733
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:16,680
- For real?
- Yes.

2734
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:18,720
- We'll really eat it.
- Yes.

2735
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,520
Okay. I'll cut it up.

2736
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,790
- We just took it out.
- Are you sure?

2737
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:23,860
- Yes.
- Thanks, then.

2738
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:24,920
- Sure.
- Don't complain later.

2739
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:27,130
"You had watermelon earlier."

2740
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,360
- I won't eat it.
- "We'll play a watermelon game."

2741
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,630
"It's time for you
to become a watermelon."

2742
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:31,630
It feels weird.

2743
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:33,070
- You can eat, Joon.
- No.

2744
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:34,530
- Let's eat.
- Have some.

2745
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:36,300
- No.
- I'll do it.

2746
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,300
(Why can't you eat
what you're given?)

2747
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,700
I want a big piece.

2748
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,270
- What size?
- Like this.

2749
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:43,080
Eat and get some rest.

2750
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,410
- Thanks a lot.
- I'm serious.

2751
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:45,880
Thank you!

2752
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,310
- Guys.
- Here, Joon.

2753
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:49,520
- No, I'm fine.
- Why?

2754
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:50,980
I think there's something to it.

2755
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,550
- Okay.
- There's nothing bad.

2756
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:55,150
- It's fine.
- Yes.

2757
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,020
(He takes a huge bite.)

2758
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,690
Hey, it's pure sugar.

2759
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,060
He's really something.

2760
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:05,060
I want a piece too, you know.

2761
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,270
- Joon, you won't eat?
- No.

2762
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:10,140
Whatever happens,
it's better to have eaten.

2763
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,470
A spirit with a full belly
looks prettier.

2764
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:12,910
It's pure sugar.

2765
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:15,680
- I need to stop being suspicious.
- Share with the crew.

2766
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,340
(This darn suspicion...)

2767
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,410
Anyone who takes a piece is...

2768
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:20,550
in the same boat as them.

2769
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,850
- It's really good.
- Is it sweet?

2770
01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:26,350
- It's so tasty.
- It's really sweet.

2771
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:28,220
Joon makes his life harder.

2772
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:29,220
(He should just eat.)

2773
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:31,020
Oh, whatever. I'll eat some.

2774
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:32,460
- It smells too nice.
- Now...

2775
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:34,460
(He can't withstand the temptation.)

2776
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:36,900
Will it be okay
if I eat just one slice?

2777
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,560
Just one piece...

2778
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,470
Did we just eat a whole watermelon?

2779
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:41,500
Yes.

2780
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,070
(Eating)

2781
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,700
It's so good.

2782
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:45,710
(Even Joon enjoyed it in the end.)

2783
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:46,810
They give us something...

2784
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,210
in the summer.

2785
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:49,440
It's so sweet.

2786
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:50,640
Shall we cut it all up?

2787
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,350
I ate too much.

2788
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:53,350
(What's wrong with him?)

2789
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:54,680
- What?
- I ate too much.

2790
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:57,650
(I'm full.)

2791
01:31:57,650 --> 01:31:59,790
So what? Why are you like this?

2792
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:01,590
Why do you do this?

2793
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:04,160
- I ate this much.
- If you can't control yourself,

2794
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:06,330
tie your hands or gag yourself.

2795
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:07,960
I'm so full.

2796
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:10,900
- I feel better now.
- Is watermelon this filling?

2797
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:13,970
- You look like Di Di.
- What's that?

2798
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:15,200
My dog.

2799
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:17,500
(I'm Di Di.)

2800
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,010
- Seriously.
- He can't control himself?

2801
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:21,340
It's like Di Di...

2802
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:22,980
He eats in such a hurry.

2803
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,850
He eats hurriedly, then throws up.

2804
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,850
I scold him when he eats too fast.

2805
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:32,220
(He then pants and lies down.)

2806
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:36,560
I looked at you,
and you're like that.

2807
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,660
You're like this.

2808
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:39,790
(He's too full to even laugh.)

2809
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:40,990
You need to lie down.

2810
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:43,560
(One watermelon
brought such joy to the break.)

2811
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,600
You're pretty much alike.

2812
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:46,870
(Next episode)

2813
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:48,770
(Peaceful Gangneung...)

2814
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:49,970
(shatters.)

2815
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:54,040
(Friendship and war)

2816
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:56,440
(It turns into a mess.)

2817
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,610
(Covering his mouth)

2818
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:01,880
(Distrust deepens)

2819
01:33:02,150 --> 01:33:03,780
(It's not like that!)

2820
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,890
(Things heat up,)

2821
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:07,190
(and they're unable to speak.)

2822
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:10,220
(Will our friendship last?)

2823
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:13,160
(On a beach under the hot sun,)

2824
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:15,590
(the Defeat Fairy
yearns to go home.)

2825
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:18,030
(The only way to escape is to win.)

2826
01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:20,030
(Will you play a game with me?)

2827
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:23,700
(So begins the nightmare of games.)

2828
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,800
Rock-paper-scissors!

2829
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,940
(It's harder than he thought.)

2830
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:29,640
(Does he have to stay even longer?)

2831
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:32,950
(Can Se Yoon go home?)

2832
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:35,780
On the count of three, let's go
