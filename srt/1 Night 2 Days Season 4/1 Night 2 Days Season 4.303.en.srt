1
00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:04,805
(The morning rises in tranquility.)

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:09,685
(A picturesque scenery unfolds.)

3
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:14,685
(In a place with the peaceful spirit of hanok)

4
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:18,185
(The capital of Korea's spiritual culture)

5
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:19,924
(Today's travel destination)

6
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:23,625
(Andong)

7
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:29,365
(This place is filled with an antique vibe.)

8
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:31,234
- This is nice.
- Gosh, already...

9
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:32,335
It's gotten cold.

10
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:36,275
- Hello.
- Hello.

11
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:40,774
(What kind of trip awaits them today?)

12
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:42,444
It's Korean Cultural Theme Park.

13
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:43,885
Gosh, it looks amazing.

14
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:46,654
Tell them to come down.

15
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:48,724
- My goodness.
- Why are they so far up?

16
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:49,925
Tell them to come down.

17
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:52,624
- This is exhausting.
- Is this a site for a general?

18
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,625
(Panting)

19
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:55,925
- Hello.
- Good morning.

20
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:58,594
- Hello.
- Hello.

21
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:01,195
- Hello.
- Hello.

22
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,165
- Hello.
- It's cold.

23
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:04,364
Gosh, it's cold.

24
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:05,534
- Hasn't it gotten chilly?
- Yes.

25
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:07,934
- We can see our breath now.
- We can see it.

26
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,615
It's no longer possible to sleep outdoors.

27
00:01:10,175 --> 00:01:12,255
- By the way...
- The "The Return of Superman" host.

28
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,814
(Congratulations, Kim Jong Min became a host.)

29
00:01:14,815 --> 00:01:16,614
He's thinking of going after the Grand Award in entertainment.

30
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:18,114
- Oh, my.
- Jong Min.

31
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:19,314
Give us a preview of "The Return of Superman."

32
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:22,014
What's the opening remark that you made as the host?

33
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,324
- How do you start the show?
- Jong Min,

34
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:24,525
what's your opening remark?

35
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,055
- I wasn't given the opening remark.
- Then who says it?

36
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:28,864
I start the show naturally.

37
00:01:28,865 --> 00:01:30,164
- Naturally?
- Yes.

38
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:31,765
- Did you just stay in your seat?
- Yes.

39
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:34,435
But...

40
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:39,405
(Our eldest member did a good job during the shoot.)

41
00:01:39,735 --> 00:01:42,074
Yesterday, Sae Ho and Se Yoon...

42
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:43,344
They went on a trip as friends.

43
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:44,604
Let's be honest.

44
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,574
We should reduce their performance fee on 2 Days 1 Night.

45
00:01:46,575 --> 00:01:48,645
- That's right.
- I'm being serious.

46
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:50,984
After getting here the day before, like friends on a trip...

47
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,184
They hugged and put their heads together.

48
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,385
This is what they do.

49
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:55,414
(Here's a photo as proof.)

50
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,024
(Working and traveling as friends at the same time)

51
00:01:58,025 --> 00:01:59,394
They put their heads together.

52
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:01,955
- We just took a photo together.
- Like two adult men on a trip.

53
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,664
By the way, where are we?

54
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:06,364
- We're in Andong.
- This is Andong.

55
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:08,364
- It's a cultural theme park.
- That's right.

56
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:09,965
It's located in Andong.

57
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:12,064
It was created based on a theme...

58
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,275
of Joseon's righteous army war in the 16th century.

59
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,844
This is Korean Cultural Theme Park.

60
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,945
(Korean Cultural Theme Park)

61
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:22,744
(A cultural and tourism complex...)

62
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:24,814
(that offers a wide range of experiences)

63
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:27,154
Also, there's a lot of food to eat.

64
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:28,954
- When it comes to Andong...
- Braised chicken.

65
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:30,154
- Braised chicken, salted mackerel.
- Mackerel.

66
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:31,424
- Soju.
- Galbi.

67
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:33,194
- Andong noodles.
- Gukbap.

68
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,054
And there's heotjesabap. It's excellent.

69
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,224
- What did you say?
- It's called heotjesabap.

70
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:39,795
It's not made or an ancestral rite,

71
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:41,534
but the food is the same.

72
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:42,904
- Food for an ancestral rite?
- There's such a restaurant.

73
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:45,874
You hold a mock ancestral rite because the food is delicious.

74
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:46,974
- A mock ancestral rite?
- Yes.

75
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:49,244
I heard you practiced this line last night at the motel.

76
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:50,844
- I practiced this morning.
- This morning?

77
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:51,944
You practiced with a loud voice.

78
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:53,844
He said, "Heotjesabap."

79
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:55,944
You will be traveling again today.

80
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:57,045
- Okay.
- All right.

81
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:59,315
Please turn around.

82
00:02:59,585 --> 00:03:01,954
(Command Post of the Righteous Army)

83
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:03,685
- What's that?
- Goodness.

84
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:06,325
(What did they see?)

85
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:10,094
Gate 1 and Gate 2.

86
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:12,235
(Pick 1 of the 2.)

87
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:14,465
Why is my life a continuation of making choices?

88
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:15,764
I know.

89
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:17,411
- Making choices never ends.
- I have to choose every day.

90
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:18,974
It's bad when I make the wrong choice.

91
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:21,275
Each of you will set out.

92
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,675
Pick 1 of the 2 gates and go out.

93
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,474
This is where our fate is decided.

94
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:28,845
For each gate,

95
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:31,714
- three of you can go through.
- Okay.

96
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:33,414
- I'll start.
- Okay.

97
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:34,754
Since your hair is long, you go.

98
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:36,024
- Okay, I'll go next.
- Yes.

99
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:37,124
I'll be number three.

100
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,484
Then I'm number four.

101
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,154
- You're number 5.
- You should be 5 and 6.

102
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:41,194
All right.

103
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:42,694
- We decided the order.
- Is everyone okay with it?

104
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:43,695
- Yes.
- All right.

105
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:45,265
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

106
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:47,065
See you down there.

107
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:48,164
DinDin.

108
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:49,464
- He's number one.
- DinDin.

109
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:50,534
Shall I go?

110
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:53,034
I bet DinDin will pick Gate One.

111
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:54,475
If DinDin picks 1, I'll pick 2.

112
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:57,466
- Sae Ho, which one will you pick?
- I promise to follow your choice.

113
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,214
That's not what I was thinking.

114
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:00,374
You don't want to go with me?

115
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,744
- Which gate will you pick?
- Gate Two.

116
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:03,284
- When is your turn?
- I'm going second.

117
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,285
- Second?
- Yes.

118
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,884
It won't mean anything. No one will follow that.

119
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:07,385
I'll do the opposite of DinDin.

120
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,785
With his front teeth, shouldn't he pick number two?

121
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,555
Front teeth, number two.

122
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:16,595
(Despite Se Yoon's mocking, he goes down with composure.)

123
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:18,065
(Sighing)

124
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:20,935
(What will be DinDin's choice?)

125
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:25,264
(He picks Gate 1.)

126
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,404
- Gate One.
- He's going this way.

127
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:27,475
Gate One?

128
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:29,045
I bet Gate One is...

129
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:30,874
- It will be bad.
- I agree.

130
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,474
I can't tell what's behind the gates.

131
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:34,015
Do you think Gate One is a bad choice?

132
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,015
(DinDin comes out through the gate.)

133
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:40,815
- I'll pick number two.
- Gosh.

134
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:42,824
He's acting.

135
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,384
Gate One must be good.

136
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,424
- I think Gate One is good.
- Okay.

137
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:46,694
- Look at him acting.
- Here I go.

138
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:47,754
Gate One must be good.

139
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,194
It's obvious that DinDin is acting.

140
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:50,524
- I get it.
- You know what I mean?

141
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,124
He said, "Gosh." I'll also pick Gate One.

142
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,264
- Gate One is definitely good.
- No way.

143
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:55,864
His reaction was so fake.

144
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:56,865
- Really?
- Yes.

145
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:58,605
- Where should I go?
- Pick Gate Two.

146
00:04:58,705 --> 00:04:59,705
Gate One is definitely good.

147
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:00,705
- I'll pick Gate One.
- His reaction was fake.

148
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:01,705
Se Yoon.

149
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:03,004
- Go through Gate 2 and tell us.
- Go through Gate 2.

150
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:04,844
Since DinDin picked Gate 1, you should pick Gate 2.

151
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,014
- Pick Gate Two and react.
- Right.

152
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,374
You should show us.

153
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,615
Tell us by exclaiming.

154
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:12,684
Sae Ho is thinking.

155
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:14,285
(What will be Sae Ho's choice?)

156
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:16,754
He'll pretend to pick Gate 2 but go through Gate 1.

157
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:18,525
Come on. Don't do that.

158
00:05:19,255 --> 00:05:20,394
Which one?

159
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:21,554
- Gate 2.
- Gate 2.

160
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,265
- Gate 2.
- Go through Gate 2 and react.

161
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:25,325
- Cho Sae Ho, Gate Two.
- Okay.

162
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:27,164
Let us hear your true reaction.

163
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:29,405
He's going through Gate Two. It's over once you open it.

164
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:31,434
- You made your choice.
- It's over.

165
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:32,674
(What is behind Gate 2?)

166
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:33,774
I can't see.

167
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:36,574
(Sae Ho comes out through the other gate.)

168
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:38,645
(Shouting)

169
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,114
(Here's my reaction for you.)

170
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:42,115
(Screaming)

171
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:44,444
He's being honest.

172
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:45,984
- That's real.
- Is that real?

173
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:47,655
- Or is he acting?
- That's real.

174
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:52,285
(Their reactions are similar yet different.)

175
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:53,494
Listen.

176
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:55,995
- The voice tone is important.
- When he shouted,

177
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:57,865
the production crew laughed.

178
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:00,255
- It means that it's something bad.
- Right.

179
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:01,434
Exactly.

180
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:03,164
When DinDin shouted, no one laughed.

181
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:04,335
That's right.

182
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,605
- I will go.
- Since they laughed...

183
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,004
Which number are you?

184
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:09,144
Wait a minute.

185
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:10,404
- Hold on.
- What's going on?

186
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,004
- Let's decide the order again.
- Wait.

187
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,374
- No.
- Hold on.

188
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,874
- Wait.
- What's with the order?

189
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,044
- I know.
- We didn't do rock-paper-scissors.

190
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:17,284
You will get to choose. Don't worry.

191
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:18,344
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

192
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,114
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- No way.

193
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:21,314
Stop him.

194
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,954
- You can't do this.
- Where are you going?

195
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:24,925
Let's play rock-paper-scissors. What?

196
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:27,495
Sae Ho's reaction was honest.

197
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,894
And the production crew laughed.

198
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:31,265
(He looks back at the clues.)

199
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:32,895
However, at DinDin,

200
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:35,235
no one laughed.

201
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:39,774
(Jong Min picks Gate 1.)

202
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,474
Gate One has to be good.

203
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:43,345
(Will Gate 1 be good as they suppose?)

204
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:45,974
(Peeking)

205
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:49,245
I want this one.

206
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,384
- That sounds real.
- It's something good.

207
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:52,515
It sounds real.

208
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:54,514
(Is it true?)

209
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,515
I mean...

210
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,555
(Look behind you.)

211
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,054
(Nobleman)

212
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,824
I listened to your reaction carefully.

213
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:04,724
(Jong Min came out through the nobleman gate.)

214
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:05,995
I listened to your reaction.

215
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:07,565
(Shouting)

216
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:09,865
(DinDin's situation a moment ago)

217
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:11,364
(Turning around)

218
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,035
(Nobleman)

219
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:15,774
(Reacting as quietly as possible)

220
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:16,905
I can't tell.

221
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:18,404
What...

222
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,444
(Isn't nobleman a good thing?)

223
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:20,545
I can't tell.

224
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:25,015
(How about the other gate that Sae Ho picked?)

225
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:27,055
(Screaming)

226
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:29,484
(Without knowing what was ahead, )

227
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:31,985
(he got excited at the thought of fooling other members.)

228
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,394
I tried to pick Gate One, but they begged me not to do it.

229
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:35,754
They told me to pick Gate Two.

230
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,824
(Look over there.)

231
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:40,734
(Farmhand)

232
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:43,635
(It's obviously a bad thing.)

233
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:44,965
(Sighing)

234
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,405
I should've picked Gate One.

235
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:48,934
- Sae Ho.
- Goodness.

236
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,244
- Is it starting from now on?
- Yes.

237
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,544
(Nobleman DinDin exploits him immediately.)

238
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:52,915
Carry it for me.

239
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:58,445
(This trip's theme is finally revealed.)

240
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:01,015
(Those who pick Gate 1...)

241
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:05,685
(will become noblemen and enjoy privileges.)

242
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:08,125
(Those who pick Gate 2)

243
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,764
(Farmhand)

244
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:12,995
(They will become farmhands who serve the noblemen.)

245
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:17,035
(It's fate ordained by the one above.)

246
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:19,175
Gate One is definitely something good.

247
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:23,305
(Everyone has a sharp intuition.)

248
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:27,215
(The current number of people)

249
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:29,814
(The fourth member, Se Yoon sets out.)

250
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:30,815
I got it.

251
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:34,655
(He goes directly to Gate 1.)

252
00:08:34,985 --> 00:08:36,654
(1 is better than 2)

253
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:38,855
(That's what I like)

254
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:43,025
(Anticipating)

255
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:46,194
- They pick things up so fast.
- They really do.

256
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:47,195
Goodness.

257
00:08:47,465 --> 00:08:48,565
Yes.

258
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:51,434
(Se Yoon becomes a nobleman.)

259
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:53,275
- What?
- I also wanted to pick Gate One.

260
00:08:54,235 --> 00:08:57,745
Those who are pure-blood like us have good intuition.

261
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,175
(There are no more spots for nobleman.)

262
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,845
(Seon Ho comes through Gate 2.)

263
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:05,915
Gosh, he looks so weak.

264
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:07,784
(Yoo Seon Ho becomes a farmhand.)

265
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,285
He looks very weak.

266
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:11,684
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

267
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,595
- With Joon.
- Joon.

268
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,725
- What's going on?
- Joon is an ace.

269
00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:18,224
- We can't tell if it's good or not.
- We can't.

270
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,294
- Then why...
- Just because.

271
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:20,734
Why did you react like that?

272
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:21,765
Hey, you.

273
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:23,935
How dare you point your finger?

274
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:25,905
Turn around, you boy.

275
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:27,005
What?

276
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:28,675
Darn it.

277
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:29,905
(I see...)

278
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:31,575
- Today, - Come here.

279
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:33,014
I will show you what hard work is.

280
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:34,045
Come here.

281
00:09:34,145 --> 00:09:35,374
All three of you, stand here straight.

282
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,785
Please stand in line.

283
00:09:36,915 --> 00:09:38,045
This is tiring.

284
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:39,755
Why is my day starting like this?

285
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,714
They say that a person's social status is...

286
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:42,954
determined not by human will,

287
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:45,455
but by the will of the one above.

288
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:47,495
- Don't be ridiculous.
- That's right.

289
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:49,764
If they aren't being obedient...

290
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:50,794
Can we spank them?

291
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:52,564
I'd like to strike them with a rod.

292
00:09:52,565 --> 00:09:53,565
(Feeling dizzy)

293
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:56,664
After you dress up as noblemen and farmhands,

294
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:58,534
- we'll get started.
- Dressing up?

295
00:09:58,535 --> 00:09:59,604
Are we dressing up?

296
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:01,205
- Please give me warm socks.
- But...

297
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:03,845
This is too...

298
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:07,044
(Noblemen: Jong Min, Se Yoon, DinDin)

299
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:09,175
(Farmhands: Sae Ho, Joon, Seon Ho)

300
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,014
This is how you put it on.

301
00:10:11,015 --> 00:10:12,754
- Gosh.
- Is this it?

302
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:13,814
Yes.

303
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:15,215
What are you doing? Do this for me.

304
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:19,595
Hurry up. Hey, do it.

305
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:22,694
- Each of you, help me get dressed.
- Do what?

306
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:24,525
Grab my clothes already.

307
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,064
Hurry up.

308
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:29,545
Are we really splitting into teams like this? It's ridiculous.

309
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:31,305
Do you know how to tie a knot?

310
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:35,075
- No, but I'll try.
- You've never worn this before.

311
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:38,045
(The farmhand's life has started for real.)

312
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,644
- This is your last chance.
- Come over here.

313
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:42,125
- Last chance, my foot.
- Jong Min...

314
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:45,514
- What are you doing?
- That works well.

315
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:46,585
What?

316
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:50,625
(Sae Ho is concentrating on something.)

317
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:52,894
It will be put on you, but you're very enthusiastic about it.

318
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:55,195
I like things like this.

319
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,125
- I really like it.
- Okay.

320
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,865
- Are you putting it on yourself?
- Of course.

321
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:02,195
Why are you putting makeup on yourself?

322
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:05,005
- It's fun.
- It's fun?

323
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,604
He understands his place.

324
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:07,711
(He's the type who enjoys his fate.)

325
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,304
I can't understand him either.

326
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:10,404
Why not?

327
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:11,544
- Doesn't he look...
- Why are you doing it yourself?

328
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,845
Doesn't he look lovely?

329
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:15,845
He accepts his status as a farmhand immediately.

330
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:18,415
- It's nice to see.
- This is great.

331
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,514
- You punks.
- What?

332
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:21,791
(He transformed into a corrupt official.)

333
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:24,554
Come over here.

334
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:26,854
- I got my makeup done.
- No.

335
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:27,895
No way.

336
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,835
- What are you doing?
- Can I do it?

337
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:31,424
What are you doing? Why would you put it on me?

338
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,564
Noblemen need makeup too.

339
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:34,064
- Why me?
- To make you look handsome.

340
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:35,065
No way.

341
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,664
- You look like a child.
- No way.

342
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:38,004
- Come over here.
- I'm a child.

343
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:39,034
No, you're not.

344
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:40,834
- No, I'm not a servant.
- I'll wear makeup too.

345
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:41,835
Goodness.

346
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:45,245
(To make him look like a dignified nobleman)

347
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,845
Say, "Hey, you."

348
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:49,744
- Hey, you.
- Say, "Come here."

349
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:51,244
- Come here.
- Come here.

350
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:52,385
Good job.

351
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:53,654
My gosh.

352
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:57,755
(You who fill my heart)

353
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,425
"Come here."

354
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:01,725
Isn't it great? This is great.

355
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:08,735
(Nobleman DinDin, a little nobleman with catfish mustache)

356
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:14,804
(Nobleman Se Yoon...)

357
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:17,805
(who boasts a variety of charms)

358
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,814
(Nobleman Jong Min, )

359
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:23,815
(a standard textbook of how nobleman should be)

360
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:29,455
(Farmhand Joon, I have nothing on my mind)

361
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:35,595
(Farmhand Seon Ho, captivating the nobleman's heart with his looks)

362
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:39,734
(Farmhand Sae Ho, )

363
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:43,304
(totally absorbed in his farmhand character)

364
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,365
Is that good?

365
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:48,034
(They transformed into noblemen and farmhands.)

366
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,905
Today's theme is Nobleman and Farmhand.

367
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,944
- Nobleman and Farmhand?
- Yes.

368
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:56,075
A nobleman and a farmhand will pair up...

369
00:12:56,515 --> 00:12:58,684
and spend the day together.

370
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:00,855
- We'll become a couple.
- Yes.

371
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,655
I'll be in charge of someone.

372
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:04,955
We're pairing up.

373
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:06,654
- Three against three is better.
- Goodness.

374
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:09,354
You must pick your nobleman or farmhand wisely.

375
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,295
It will be useful to your trip today.

376
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,165
- Goodness.
- Each of us gets a farmhand.

377
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,364
- This will be lonely.
- All right.

378
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,904
Partner matching will begin now.

379
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:20,534
The farmhands will pick the nobleman...

380
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,304
- whom they'll serve today.
- This is good.

381
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:23,745
This is wonderful.

382
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,374
The partner matching will be led...

383
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,115
by Nobleman Se Yoon.

384
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:28,714
He's good at this.

385
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:30,585
But I didn't get anything for this.

386
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:33,954
(Ta-da)

387
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:36,224
- He's good at this.
- What's this?

388
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:37,454
- He's very good.
- He's good at hiding.

389
00:13:37,455 --> 00:13:40,254
We will start the matching...

390
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:42,295
of the noblemen and farmhands.

391
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:43,395
Here we go.

392
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:45,095
(Giggling)

393
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:50,735
Exciting Sunday, it's burning with passion tonight.

394
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:52,035
(Laughing)

395
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:53,934
(Exciting Sunday, )

396
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:56,345
(it's burning with passion tonight.)

397
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:57,475
- "Tonight?"
- All right!

398
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,114
For noblemen and farmhands,

399
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:03,114
it's time to find your perfect match again.

400
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:05,384
(Moon Se Yoon's Perfect Match)

401
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:06,385
He sounds like Ho Dong.

402
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:09,625
Let's meet the farmhand candidates first.

403
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:12,455
We have Farmhand Number 1, 2, and 3.

404
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,254
The noblemen may choose...

405
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:15,994
after seeing the farmhands' charms.

406
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:17,194
- Why would we show our charms?
- All right.

407
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:18,394
Wait a minute.

408
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:20,311
No matter which nobleman we get, it's terrible for us.

409
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:21,464
Why would we show our charms?

410
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:22,934
- I don't want to attract them.
- Then...

411
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:25,805
Shouldn't the noblemen show us their charms instead?

412
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:27,434
- Hey, be careful.
- I can't wrap it up.

413
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:28,634
- You could get hurt.
- What's going on here?

414
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:31,375
- Let's punish him.
- All right.

415
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:33,514
(Joon feels wronged.)

416
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:36,884
Based on the information, Farmhand Joon has...

417
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:39,714
worked out for many years.

418
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:42,314
He's good at work that requires strength.

419
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,984
Could you show us your charm like doing push-ups?

420
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:47,094
You must make yourself attractive to be sold at a high price.

421
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,355
What kind of charm will you show us?

422
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:51,295
Can you lift the farmhand next to you?

423
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,694
- Him?
- Do squats...

424
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,395
- while carrying him.
- Do some squats.

425
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,564
(That's a piece of cake.)

426
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,975
- Do squats while carrying him.
- One, two, three.

427
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:01,474
Do squats while carrying him.

428
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:02,574
(Throwing down)

429
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:03,874
That's all.

430
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:04,975
(What was that?)

431
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:06,844
(Embarrassed)

432
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:08,244
That's all.

433
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:10,684
(Farmhand Number 2 ended up getting humiliated for no reason.)

434
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:11,685
I'm sorry.

435
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:13,254
- I'm sorry.
- What was that about?

436
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:14,814
- I enjoyed it.
- That farmhand...

437
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:16,401
- Number Two is...
- Farmhand Number Two.

438
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:18,484
He seems completely useless.

439
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:19,924
Noblemen, listen up.

440
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,854
It's a joke up to Number Two.

441
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,664
I'm looking forward to seeing the last one.

442
00:15:23,665 --> 00:15:25,724
He looks completely useless.

443
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,165
I have no expectations. Number Two,

444
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,164
- show us your charm.
- What do you want to see?

445
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:30,365
Why don't you sing?

446
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:35,504
(Singing carelessly)

447
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:36,844
(Smiling)

448
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,245
Should I hit him with a rod?

449
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:41,914
All right, this is our ace.

450
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:43,715
- No way.
- Farmhand Number Three.

451
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:46,784
- Show us your charm.
- I'm very shy.

452
00:15:46,785 --> 00:15:48,284
I don't know what to do.

453
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:49,984
Here I am

454
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:51,024
(He's been waiting for this moment.)

455
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:52,325
That's good.

456
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,124
(Nobleman, you're the only one for me)

457
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,995
- That's great.
- Nice.

458
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,595
(He was born quick and agile like a farmhand.)

459
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:01,595
That's nice.

460
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:02,795
(Singing)

461
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:05,435
(What's with that farmhand?)

462
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:07,504
(Things get heated up thanks to Farmhand Number 3.)

463
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:08,535
Nice.

464
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:11,175
(You're my only love)

465
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,615
Gosh, I like him.

466
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:15,574
(He even does a sharp ending pose.)

467
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,544
- If he's this good...
- I'm too embarrassed to continue.

468
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:19,284
If he's this good, I wouldn't make him work.

469
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:20,514
I can't do it anymore.

470
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,514
- Next is...
- Let's have a drink together.

471
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,185
- Let's do that.
- May I join you?

472
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,194
We enjoyed watching all the farmhands.

473
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,994
Just because of our different status,

474
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:30,324
we can't discriminate against anyone.

475
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:33,065
This time, we'll have noblemen introduce themselves.

476
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:34,464
That's good.

477
00:16:34,465 --> 00:16:36,334
- I didn't expect this.
- They should show their charms too.

478
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:38,634
Let's start with Number One, the little nobleman.

479
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:40,834
Nobleman DinDin, please introduce yourself.

480
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:43,105
- Hello.
- Nobleman Number One.

481
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:45,104
I'm the only son of the third generation.

482
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,715
So I grew up sheltered.

483
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:49,644
I believe that everyone is equal.

484
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:51,444
- I also think that...
- Right.

485
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,884
- our status can change anytime.
- Yes

486
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:55,515
- He's smart. He's right.
- If you become my farmhand,

487
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,855
I will treat you like a friend,

488
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,985
- not a farmhand.
- That's right.

489
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,255
- There won't be any hierarchy.
- I like that.

490
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,424
- I will maintain a relationship...
- I like his attitude.

491
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:05,594
- that's mutually beneficial.
- That's a good attitude.

492
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:06,794
He's a thoughtful nobleman.

493
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:08,665
- A thoughtful nobleman.
- Yes.

494
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:11,334
- DinDin is Nobleman Number One.
- I'm a thoughtful nobleman.

495
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:13,335
I heard a lot...

496
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,474
about this nobleman before.

497
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,404
He's changed a lot.

498
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:19,445
- By the way...
- He was cruel in the past,

499
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:21,175
but he's changed a lot now.

500
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:22,574
We're in this together.

501
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,614
Let's go together, Nobleman Number One.

502
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:26,284
- Yes, let's go together.
- That was Nobleman DinDin.

503
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:27,754
The world is still a warm place.

504
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,984
I'm Nobleman Number Two. Let me introduce myself.

505
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:31,155
Go ahead.

506
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:33,825
I'm Nobleman Number Two, Moon Se Yoon.

507
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:36,294
My basic motto is the same.

508
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:38,195
We're equal.

509
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,524
- When we eat together, - That's true.

510
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,235
Eat a little less than me.

511
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:43,034
As long as you eat a little less than me,

512
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,264
everything will be fine.

513
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:45,534
How could we eat less than you?

514
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:47,374
- You have to starve.
- Just starve.

515
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,434
You know what's scary about him?

516
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,675
I can't talk back to him carelessly.

517
00:17:52,175 --> 00:17:54,844
- You can do it carelessly.
- No way.

518
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:56,014
Do it carelessly.

519
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:58,614
(Do it carelessly.)

520
00:17:58,615 --> 00:18:00,714
How is that relationship equal?

521
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,684
- Everyone, we're equal.
- "Do it carelessly."

522
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:03,784
Everyone, pay attention.

523
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:05,225
Here comes the nobleman ace.

524
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,424
This is Nobleman Number Three.

525
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:09,025
Hey, you.

526
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:12,125
(Full of grumpiness)

527
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:15,735
(Is he a corrupt official?)

528
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:18,335
- He has a strong impression.
- He looks mean.

529
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,675
He's lived 18 years with malice.

530
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:23,575
He's Nobleman Nolboo of 2 Days 1 Night.

531
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,374
Who are you?

532
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,045
I used to be a farmhand.

533
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:29,914
(Nobleman Number 3 used to be a farmhand?)

534
00:18:29,915 --> 00:18:31,995
- Were you born a farmhand?
- I was born a farmhand.

535
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:33,985
Then I earned a lot in the stock market,

536
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:36,315
so I paid to become a nobleman. You hear?

537
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,654
- He has no roots.
- He bought his status.

538
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:40,215
If you find it unfair, buy it yourself.

539
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:42,194
All right.

540
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:43,525
(What a funny nobleman.)

541
00:18:43,895 --> 00:18:45,295
If you get matched with me,

542
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,665
you'll get a taste of the underworld.

543
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:50,965
(Feeling dizzy)

544
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:53,504
One of you will end up on my team.

545
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,804
- This year...
- One of you will end up on my team.

546
00:18:55,805 --> 00:18:56,874
We can't join him.

547
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,774
Of all the shoots this year, you're enjoying this the most.

548
00:18:58,775 --> 00:18:59,974
May I ask you...

549
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:02,215
to laugh greedily?

550
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:04,615
(Laughing)

551
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:09,654
(The farmhand is completely satisfied.)

552
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:11,084
I like to kick.

553
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:13,794
(Nobleman Number 3's specialty is kicking.)

554
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:14,854
That was nice.

555
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:17,424
It might damage your reputation. Are you okay with that?

556
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:18,495
I'm okay with it.

557
00:19:19,295 --> 00:19:21,265
His reputation can't get any worse than it is.

558
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,304
- We finished introducing...
- That's intense.

559
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:24,934
Ourselves as noblemen and farmhands.

560
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:26,364
- All right.
- Yes.

561
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,205
Now is the time to choose.

562
00:19:29,105 --> 00:19:30,344
(Nervous)

563
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:32,674
Noblemen, please turn around.

564
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:35,374
Farmhands will stand behind...

565
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,844
- the nobleman of their choice.
- Do we get to pick?

566
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:38,721
- Do we get to pick?
- The farmhands get to pick?

567
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,584
- The farmhands...
- When multiple farmhands pick...

568
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:42,084
the same nobleman, the nobleman gets to pick.

569
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:44,225
- Right.
- The remaining farmhands go away.

570
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:46,424
"Why didn't you pick me in the beginning?"

571
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:48,025
- That's what happens.
- Exactly.

572
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:49,295
Now...

573
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:51,494
We have to be smart about this.

574
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:53,494
- We have to be smart.
- Three noblemen.

575
00:19:53,495 --> 00:19:55,094
Please stand in line.

576
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:57,081
(Which nobleman and farmhand will become a couple?)

577
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:59,141
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Do you have someone in mind?

578
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,334
- What about you?
- DinDin.

579
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:01,335
DinDin?

580
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:02,975
- What's your plan?
- If...

581
00:20:03,505 --> 00:20:04,945
no one picks me,

582
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,015
I'll make my farmhand suffer.

583
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:11,885
- The one who's forced to be mine.
- Welcome to the underworld.

584
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,084
We made our choice.

585
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:15,584
(Meanwhile, the farmhands made their choice.)

586
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:16,785
We made our choice.

587
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:19,054
- All right.
- I guess they didn't even argue.

588
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:20,095
Farmhands.

589
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:23,495
Please stand behind the nobleman of your choice.

590
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:27,095
If no one is behind me, and someone is forced to be with me,

591
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:28,895
you'll be on your own to think.

592
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,864
I have no such condition.

593
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:32,265
I'd be grateful if they picked me.

594
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,035
We're equal.

595
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,044
The roles could get reversed...

596
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:38,745
- anytime.
- You have three seconds.

597
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,644
Three, two, one.

598
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:44,061
(What will be the farmhands' choice?)

599
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:45,284
Time is up. Okay.

600
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,785
(They picked their nobleman.)

601
00:20:47,255 --> 00:20:48,754
It feels like someone is behind me.

602
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:49,985
(Anticipating)

603
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:51,984
(The noblemen are extremely nervous...)

604
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,705
(at the thought of meeting their farmhand.)

605
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:55,624
(Who will be my farmhand?)

606
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,424
(Glancing)

607
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:58,525
One,

608
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:00,694
two...

609
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:02,795
(The farmhands are just as nervous.)

610
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:05,135
(Pit-a-pat)

611
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:08,005
(Which nobleman did the farmhands pick?)

612
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:11,705
One, two, three.

613
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:18,919
One, two, three.

614
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,409
- Let's go.
- Nice to see you, my farmhand.

615
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,709
- Master.
- You punk.

616
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,779
Nice to meet you.

617
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,850
Oh, my.

618
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,619
- Goodness, it's good to see you.
- I look forward to serving you.

619
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,889
- The ace is here.
- Somehow...

620
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,159
we ended up standing here together.

621
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,130
Our ace is here. My gosh.

622
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,830
You didn't pick me?

623
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,399
My goodness.

624
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,630
- It's good to see you.
- Darn it.

625
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,900
All right.

626
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,099
I really like you.

627
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,169
(Furious)

628
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,599
You didn't pick me?

629
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,839
One of you will suffer.

630
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,070
(A notice of suffering)

631
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,710
Can't 1 nobleman keep 2 farmhands?

632
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,880
I'd rather die than work for him.

633
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,080
- They're in trouble.
- Nobleman Se Yoon.

634
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,319
You will pick one of the farmhands.

635
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,889
The farmhand who doesn't get chosen.

636
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,460
I suggest he bite his tongue.

637
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
It's better to bite your tongue.

638
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,490
- I cannot decide.
- This is the worst.

639
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,999
Goodness.

640
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,060
- He's very scary.
- What is it?

641
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,130
May I say something?

642
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,299
- I heard that...
- Yes?

643
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,610
You and I were the same age.

644
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,069
(How dare you?)

645
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,439
Who do you think you are?

646
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,609
- Are you...
- I just want to say...

647
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,679
- that it isn't true.
- Is that so?

648
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,409
Of course. I'm not your equal.

649
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,719
Okay. Go ahead and say something.

650
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,380
I will yield my food to you.

651
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,850
You, go away.

652
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,489
You, go away.

653
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,559
(Feeling wronged)

654
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,859
- Good job.
- It's nothing.

655
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,629
Good job. That's right.

656
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,659
- How dare you?
- Where should I go?

657
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,230
Welcome to the underworld. Go to him.

658
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,570
Go to him. Open the gate to the underworld.

659
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,800
- I've been waiting for you.
- You punk.

660
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,480
(It's time for punishment.)

661
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,880
(Laughing)

662
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,209
- I waited for you all night long.
- What did you say?

663
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,450
(Panting with anger)

664
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,180
Look how excited Jong Min is.

665
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,090
This is fun.

666
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,760
Come up with many scenarios like this.

667
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,589
(The nobleman is 100 percent satisfied.)

668
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,190
My goodness.

669
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,580
- Jong Min can kick him.
- He looks like a real character.

670
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,480
As the result of the partner matching,

671
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,399
Nobleman Jong Min and Farmhand Sae Ho are one team.

672
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,099
(Farmhand Sae Ho, Nobleman Jong Min)

673
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,369
Nobleman DinDin and Farmhand Joon.

674
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,370
They're one team.

675
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,339
- Nobleman Se Yoon...
- Are these the teams?

676
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,439
- and Farmhand Seon Ho.
- Really?

677
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,639
- They're one team.
- My Lord.

678
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,179
- I feel honored.
- "My Lord?"

679
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,549
What should I call you?

680
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,180
I look forward to serving you.

681
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,620
All right, everyone.

682
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,949
From now on,

683
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,989
the farmhands have to obey their nobleman no matter what.

684
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,990
Really?

685
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:45,860
- Sae Ho is in trouble today.
- Be quiet.

686
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,429
Now that you're partners,

687
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,660
why don't you name your farmhand?

688
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,329
Are we also changing our names?

689
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,830
Is there a name that you'd like?

690
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:57,099
I will answer to whatever you call me.

691
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,340
How about Grubby?

692
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,910
Grubby?

693
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,509
I'll call him Lovely.

694
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,039
- Lovely?
- Lovely.

695
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,210
- Lovely. Yes.
- Okay.

696
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,650
I'll call him by his English name.

697
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,290
- Sebastian.
- Sebastian?

698
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,419
- Sebastian? It's his English name.
- Yes, Sebastian.

699
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,390
I'll call him by his western name.

700
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,860
I'll name him Hooray.

701
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,090
- Hooray?
- Hooray?

702
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,090
Hooray!

703
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
(Hooray)

704
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,730
- Since it's Seon Ho, Hooray.
- Hooray?

705
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,430
The noblemen and farmhands' trip in Andong.

706
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,769
- Let's get started.
- Let's go.

707
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,970
- This is fun.
- Okay.

708
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,469
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

709
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,139
(Nobleman Jong Min sets out full of energy.)

710
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,240
All right, boy.

711
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,380
Push me gently from the back.

712
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,549
Se Yoon, it's this way.

713
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,950
Is it the opposite direction?

714
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,700
The sun is out. You go in front of me.

715
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,519
- There's the sun.
- Hooray.

716
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,920
- Don't step on my shadow.
- Okay.

717
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,389
- Move away a little.
- Okay.

718
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,959
- Why is your shadow so big?
- Lovely.

719
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,400
- Don't step on my shadow.
- Your shadow is about 3m long.

720
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,869
(Noblemen and farmhands of 3 colors and 3 charms)

721
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,599
(They set out on their trip.)

722
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,070
Mr. Nobleman, let's go.

723
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,839
- Hooray.
- Hooray.

724
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,069
- Let's go.
- You boys.

725
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,669
- Hooray.
- Yes?

726
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,909
Find out how much longer we have to walk.

727
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,179
How much longer do we have to walk?

728
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,379
(The farmhands expect a rough day.)

729
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,880
- We're almost there.
- Really?

730
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,679
- Gosh, the view is amazing.
- Oh, my.

731
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,649
(They arrive where there's a panoramic view of Andong Lake.)

732
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,149
- No, don't look.
- Gosh.

733
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,519
- Don't look.
- Why not?

734
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,889
- Turn around.
- Why?

735
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,736
- It's so beautiful.
- Look behind you instead.

736
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,190
Look at the mountain behind you.

737
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,489
- I didn't even look.
- Don't look.

738
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,660
He said that we were equal.

739
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,300
I guess we aren't.

740
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,799
This is scary.

741
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,269
(Lovely who's getting persecuted by DinDin)

742
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,400
One.

743
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,039
(He dreams of breaking away for a moment.)

744
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,170
Are you out of your mind?

745
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,709
He must be insane.

746
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,710
Now is your chance.

747
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,710
- Go up.
- Guys.

748
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,109
One, two, three.

749
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,449
(Only the noblemen take pictures at Andong Lake.)

750
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,120
Come at me, world!

751
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,750
- Come at us, world!
- Come at us, world!

752
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,190
- My gosh.
- It's so beautiful.

753
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,419
(Andong Lake is peaceful and tranquil with the autumn vibe.)

754
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,289
- How picturesque.
- What a magnificent view.

755
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,970
- What a magnificent view.
- How stunning.

756
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,960
Jong Min, you look really well-off.

757
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,229
- Right. Why does he look so grand?
- Why does he look so rich?

758
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,769
- Seriously.
- This outfit suits you.

759
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,900
You look like an evil nobleman who actually existed in real life.

760
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,139
You did a good job with the mustache.

761
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,969
The mustache suits him really well.

762
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,109
(He definitely suits the image of a corrupt official.)

763
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,239
Everyone, thanks to the lake...

764
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,709
- Yes.
- behind you,

765
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,810
this place offers a beautiful view.

766
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,249
The name of this place is Sandae Theater.

767
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,419
- Sandae?
- Yes, Sandae Theater.

768
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,590
An important reward is at stake on our first mission.

769
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,920
- It's your lunch.
- My gosh.

770
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,789
- Okay.
- We must eat lunch no matter what.

771
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,019
- I'm so hungry.
- We must.

772
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,130
It's famous specialty of Andong.

773
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,360
It's the salted mackerel meal from Andong.

774
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,100
- This is crazy.
- I like this dish.

775
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,029
- I like this dish.
- Yes, my lord.

776
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,699
- I like this dish.
- We must eat that.

777
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,140
- I need omega-three.
- I got it, my lord.

778
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,510
Your lunch is riding on this mission.

779
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,739
It's called Civil Service Exam by Proxy Bell Ringer.

780
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,839
- Proxy Bell Ringer?
- Yes.

781
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,386
- I'll do a task on your behalf.
- A civil service exam?

782
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,079
It's called Civil Service Exam by Proxy Bell Ringer.

783
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,180
Farmhands must run hard and then ring the bell first...

784
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,049
for the noblemen to get a chance to answer the question.

785
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,050
My gosh.

786
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:04,259
(The game format is unfair.)

787
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,489
Only noblemen can take this exam.

788
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,490
- Right.
- Yes.

789
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:09,190
But my nobleman isn't educated at all.

790
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,129
All right. However, today's civil service exam...

791
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,970
(Punishing his farmhand right away)

792
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,569
You can run fast, can't you?

793
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,369
- I assure you. I'm a fast runner.
- Yes.

794
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,410
Farmhands have to be smart about this.

795
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,939
Say that your nobleman...

796
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,239
- doesn't know the answer.
- Right.

797
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,409
Then you should arrive second,

798
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,579
so your nobleman can get a hint...

799
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,926
- from the previous answer.
- Right.

800
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,549
Like Nobleman DinDin said,

801
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,979
the teamwork of a swift farmhand and a wise nobleman...

802
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,380
- will be important.
- Right.

803
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,950
There will be a total of ten questions.

804
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,889
The quality of your lunch will vary based on your scores.

805
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,330
Hold on. So we're on the same team.

806
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,930
- That's right.
- Okay.

807
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,460
I told you to use your funny voice.

808
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,830
We're on the same team, right?

809
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,369
- That was nice.
- I'm all about entertaining. Okay?

810
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,370
- That's good.
- All right.

811
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:52,069
Noblemen. Farmhands.

812
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,609
Go to your places now.

813
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,840
- Okay.
- Yes.

814
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,169
- If we lose, - Let's do this.

815
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,780
Brace yourself to be punished.

816
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,449
They'll run over there.

817
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,056
(Noblemen will sit comfortably and answer questions.)

818
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,019
(Farmhands must be ready at all times to run.)

819
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,579
Lovely. Look at my hand.

820
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,649
- If I do this, you must run.
- Okay.

821
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,720
Yes.

822
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,890
Sebastian, keep winning me chances to answer questions.

823
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,430
- I got it.
- I'll do this.

824
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,000
(The noblemen abuse their authority in their own ways.)

825
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,830
We're like their puppies.

826
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
All right.

827
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:22,930
If you think your nobleman knows the answer,

828
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,040
you must run to the cone, sprint back, and then ring the bell.

829
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,209
Civil Service Exam by Proxy Bell Ringer will begin.

830
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,370
Let's go!

831
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,339
Farmhands.

832
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,650
If you think your nobleman knows the answer,

833
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,020
run, sprint back, and ring the bell.

834
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,720
Here's the first question.

835
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,389
Since ancient times, tall people were called...

836
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,490
giants of six cheok.

837
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,990
"Cheok" was used as a unit of length.

838
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,130
He's running.

839
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,899
(He starts running before they hear the full question.)

840
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,700
- He's running.
- You know the answer, right?

841
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,650
- You know, right?
- He doesn't know.

842
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,570
It seems he has no idea.

843
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,010
(Sebastian rings the bell.)

844
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,609
- You know the answer, right?
- Go ahead.

845
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,610
All right.

846
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:05,840
I think 1 cheok is equivalent to 1.5m.

847
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,480
(Then 6 cheok is 9m?)

848
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,810
Wrong.

849
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,449
- All right. So...
- "Cheok" was used...

850
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,850
as a unit of length.

851
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:17,020
What's one cheok in centimeters?

852
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,490
Run!

853
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,129
- Run!
- Round up your answer.

854
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,959
(Hooray starts running right away at his nobleman's command.)

855
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,099
- Go.
- Wait. I can go again, right?

856
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,200
- Go?
- Go.

857
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,780
- I'm going to be second.
- Use their answers to guess it.

858
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,569
(Se Yoon will answer the question first.)

859
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,570
Okay.

860
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:32,099
Se Yoon, DinDin, and Jong Min will answer in this order.

861
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,869
- Okay. I can answer it now?
- All right.

862
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,669
All right. Come to think of it,

863
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,580
during the Joseon Dynasty, most people were short.

864
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,149
I think DinDin's height...

865
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,686
would've been considered to be six cheok back then.

866
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,979
Then what should my answer be?

867
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,120
It's 30cm!

868
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,020
- Your answer is 30cm.
- Yes.

869
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,190
- Correct.
- Gosh.

870
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,820
- Don't come.
- Darn.

871
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,259
(Don't come.)

872
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,359
How dare you try to hug me?

873
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,729
- Dance in your spot.
- Okay.

874
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,099
(The farmhand is responsible of celebrating.)

875
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,629
- Let me give you an explanation.
- Okay.

876
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:03,099
Actually, 1 cheok is about 30.3cm.

877
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,599
(Pobaekcheok: The ruler used in the Joseon period)

878
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,009
- Nobleman Se Yoon got one right.
- That's right.

879
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,070
Here's the next question.

880
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,210
During the Joseon period,

881
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,510
there were various occupations.

882
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,709
What was the term for the female detective who worked...

883
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,070
at the Royal Investigation Bureau, the Ministry of Justice,

884
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,849
and the Police Bureau from the mid-Joseon period onward?

885
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,120
I've heard of this term.

886
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,959
- What was it?
- Do you know it or not?

887
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,160
Would we all know this word?

888
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,559
- Yes. You'd recognize it...
- Would we know?

889
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,629
Once you hear it.

890
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,300
What do you say? Should I run or not?

891
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,699
Well, why don't you go for a run?

892
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,970
Give me a signal.

893
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,769
(Hooray sets out first by himself.)

894
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,000
Come on, run.

895
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,939
So it's the term for a female police officer.

896
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,870
- A female police officer?
- That must be it.

897
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,240
Seon Ho.

898
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,039
It must have something...

899
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,079
- to do with "police."
- Okay.

900
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,850
It must include the word, "police."

901
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,260
Since it's a female police officer, how about fe-po?

902
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,779
What's wrong with him? Come on.

903
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,820
Wrong!

904
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,620
Did he seriously just say, "fe-po?"

905
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,819
- He's the worst.
- I...

906
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,060
Isn't that the answer?

907
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,160
I bet female police officers used a lot of tactics to infiltrate.

908
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,630
- Maybe they're called Eoudong.
- Eoudong?

909
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,559
- Eoudong?
- As Eoudong.

910
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,440
- Are you serious about that?
- Eoudong? Wrong.

911
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,140
Will you answer it? Or will you give up?

912
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,240
I'll give up.

913
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,769
(Disappointed)

914
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,740
- Well...
- Joon seems frustrated.

915
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,210
- Give us a hint.
- Do you want a hint?

916
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,580
- Do you want a hint?
- Yes.

917
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,080
"Are you in pain?"

918
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,980
"I'm in pain too."

919
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,890
(Rushing)

920
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,420
(All the farmhands run after the critical hint.)

921
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,859
You can't grab him.

922
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,889
(Lovely tries to grab Hooray.)

923
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,399
(The farmhand in his 20s easily ditches him...)

924
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,260
(and comes in 1st.)

925
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,430
You useless farmhand, Sebastian.

926
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,769
(Sebastian comes in last again.)

927
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,770
Sae Ho.

928
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,069
Seon Ho, Sae Ho, and Joon.

929
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,639
(The young farmhand is indeed a fast runner.)

930
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,780
It was a famous line from the drama.

931
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,980
Lee Seo Jin said this famous line.

932
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,750
"Are you in pain?"

933
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Are you in pain?

934
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:01,989
(The most famous line from the early 2000s)

935
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,050
Yes.

936
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,230
"I am in pain too."

937
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,330
I reckon the title of the drama is the correct answer.

938
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,230
- "Jewel in the Crown?"
- Damo.

939
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,670
- Damo?
- Damo.

940
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,770
That's correct.

941
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,470
Don't come. You can dance there.

942
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,609
(His farmhand will celebrate by dancing again.)

943
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,170
- All right.
- Did you know the answer?

944
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,340
No.

945
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:32,180
(Damo is the term for a female detective in the Joseon period.)

946
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,889
(The occupation of the main character is called damo.)

947
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,890
We have two points now.

948
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:37,719
- We'll win with two more points.
- Yes. We'll have lunch.

949
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,989
If they win four points, they'll get the lunch?

950
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,259
We'd be safe then.

951
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,729
There are ten questions. And the highest score wins.

952
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,050
- It's okay. We have ten questions.
- What does that mean?

953
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,100
- The highest score? What?
- We'll begin.

954
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,029
The team with the highest score will win.

955
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,230
Only one team will get to eat?

956
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,200
My nobleman doesn't know what "highest score" means.

957
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,139
The team with the highest score.

958
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,646
It was shocking for me too. "The highest score?"

959
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,579
Did you guys know that food could be delivered...

960
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,909
- even during the Joseon period?
- What?

961
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:00,910
- Okay!
- Really?

962
00:33:00,911 --> 00:33:01,950
- All right.
- Go.

963
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,549
(Distrustful)

964
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,449
It was one of the first dishes to be delivered.

965
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,490
Go!

966
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,719
(Do you really know the answer?)

967
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,790
Go!

968
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,159
Go.

969
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,559
(He hasn't heard the full question. Does he really know the answer?)

970
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,960
- What?
- Sae Ho.

971
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,200
Shouldn't we listen to the complete question?

972
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,959
- The right answer is...
- Do you really know?

973
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,030
Go on.

974
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,400
It's naengmyeon.

975
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,169
- Gosh.
- I guess he's right.

976
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,539
(Did he get the correct answer right away?)

977
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,070
- How does he know that?
- Correct.

978
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,869
How did you know?

979
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,240
(My nobleman did it!)

980
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,410
How did you know the answer?

981
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,479
How did you know?

982
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,480
(The class of a nobleman)

983
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,750
According to "The Veritable Records of King Sunjo,"

984
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,849
King Sunjo often ordered naengmyeon...

985
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,060
from a street pub to the palace.

986
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,289
You didn't know that?

987
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,559
(King Sunju was admiring the moon at night...)

988
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,829
(when he ordered naengmyeon according to the records.)

989
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,430
Yes, I knew about that.

990
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,399
- Really?
- I know a lot about that period.

991
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,629
(Historian Kim is good at historical quizzes.)

992
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,539
With that, Jong Min and Sae Ho have a point too.

993
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,339
- Here's the next question.
- Sebastian.

994
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,469
(Jong Min and Sae Ho: 1 point, Se Yoon and Seon Ho: 2 points)

995
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,370
Andong is famous for fish.

996
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,709
Which of the following is not a fish?

997
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,849
- A choice that's not a fish?
- A choice that's not a fish?

998
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:08,880
All right.

999
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,120
Number one, mungtungguri.

1000
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,920
Number two, ggeolttaegi.

1001
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,590
Number three, gasiraengi.

1002
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,919
Number four, godori.

1003
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,389
Number five, dorumuk.

1004
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,950
(Which of the following is not a fish?)

1005
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,559
(This time, Sebastian is the fastest.)

1006
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,099
- Hurry up.
- My gosh.

1007
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,976
- What are you doing?
- Hurry up. Yes. He came in first.

1008
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,160
(While these two farmhands are engaged in a scuffle, )

1009
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,639
(Hooray runs at full speed.)

1010
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,840
What's wrong with you?

1011
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,210
Sae Ho.

1012
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,260
- Did you ring it?
- What's wrong with you?

1013
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,750
- Come on.
- All right.

1014
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,220
I had a few choices in mind.

1015
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,050
But I always seek for peace...

1016
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,689
and to be placed in the middle.

1017
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,659
I'll pick number three since it also sounds like my name.

1018
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,340
- What's the answer for number 3?
- What's the answer for number 3?

1019
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,659
Was it a thorn tree?

1020
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,989
- Okay. It's wrong.
- Can you repeat them?

1021
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,359
- Okay.
- You must know the term too.

1022
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
- You must know it too.
- Right.

1023
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:00,469
- You need to know the term too.
- It's not a short-answer question.

1024
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,929
- Why must I guess that too?
- You must tell us the term too.

1025
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,029
I should only do it for short-answer questions.

1026
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,640
- I'll go then.
- Number three.

1027
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,969
He can't get this right.

1028
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,639
- I still have to tell you the term?
- Five seconds. Five,

1029
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,769
- four, - I can only give you the number.

1030
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,269
- three, two, - Gasiraengi.

1031
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,410
- one.
- One.

1032
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,080
- Gasiraengi.
- Gasiraengi.

1033
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,310
That's correct.

1034
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,809
- That was correct?
- It was.

1035
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,909
Gosh, really?

1036
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,420
It's some kind of medicinal herb.

1037
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,889
It's a small and thin pieces of wood or grass.

1038
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,989
- What's going on with him today?
- Of course.

1039
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,519
- Today...
- You're on fire today.

1040
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,629
- The food...
- Gosh, what a bummer.

1041
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,929
- Are you okay?
- What a bummer.

1042
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,289
- Tomorrow...
- Be honest. What was your answer?

1043
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,359
- Number three.
- Gasiraengi?

1044
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,959
Yes. I knew all the other choices.

1045
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,169
- Really?
- What's mungtungguri then?

1046
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,970
That's a type of fish.

1047
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,340
(Laughing)

1048
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,509
That would be you, a silly fish.

1049
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,039
Isn't it similar to pollack?

1050
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,210
- All right.
- Isn't it?

1051
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,609
It's a type of lumpfish that lives in the ocean.

1052
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,610
- Really?
- Ggeolttaegi is...

1053
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,879
- a baby sea bass.
- A baby sea bass.

1054
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,419
And godori is...

1055
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,949
- It's a mackerel.
- It's a baby mackerel.

1056
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,150
- It's a baby mackerel.
- Yes.

1057
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,819
- The last one.
- I'm sure you know the last one.

1058
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,690
- Yes, it's from Gangwon Province.
- Yes.

1059
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,800
Sailfin sandfish are tasty.

1060
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,159
- I...
- Here's the next question.

1061
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,406
We just need to get one more right.

1062
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,659
- Hahoe masks from Andong...
- I see.

1063
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,329
Are an important cultural asset...

1064
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,400
and the only one designated as a national treasure.

1065
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,869
Among 11 hahoe masks,

1066
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,340
what's the name of this particular mask?

1067
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,739
What's that? I've never seen that before.

1068
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,210
- Hey.
- It must be Something Mask.

1069
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,549
I learned that in elementary school.

1070
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,856
(Lovely starts running when DinDin gives him a signal.)

1071
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,009
- Hooray.
- Hooray.

1072
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,020
Joon.

1073
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,661
- All right. The answer is...
- I bet he'll get it wrong.

1074
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,949
What is it?

1075
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,120
It's a bridal mask.

1076
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,320
Wrong.

1077
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,590
- That was your answer too, right?
- Yes.

1078
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,390
A nirvana mask.

1079
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:37,529
(Silly incorrect answers are blurted out.)

1080
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,560
DinDin's Mask.

1081
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,630
- Wrong.
- DinDin's Mask?

1082
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,770
- Do you want a hint?
- Yes.

1083
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,700
"Cholangi" is used to call short people who act cheeky.

1084
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,169
The origin of this word, "cholangi," is the key.

1085
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,170
Let's go! Why aren't you running?

1086
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,279
(The other two farmhands start running right away.)

1087
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,580
Okay. I'm running.

1088
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,619
- I bet you don't know the answer.
- I know the answer.

1089
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,150
- You do?
- Lovely.

1090
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,850
- Lovely, Hooray, and Sebastian.
- Calm down.

1091
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,489
I doubt the other two know the answer.

1092
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,490
They don't know the answer?

1093
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:06,090
- Okay. But I do. I got this.
- Lovely.

1094
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,529
It's the origin of the term that describe people who act cheeky?

1095
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,160
- Yes.
- Cholssak.

1096
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,229
Wrong.

1097
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,900
- Choksaek Mask.
- Wrong.

1098
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,560
My nobleman is going to give you the right answer now.

1099
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,969
(Relaxed)

1100
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,086
- I don't think he knows.
- The name of the mask is...

1101
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,239
What is it?

1102
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,340
It's Chorong.

1103
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,480
Chorong?

1104
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,150
Chorong? That doesn't sound right. Cheeky Chorong?

1105
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,890
- Wrong.
- What?

1106
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,550
You said you knew the answer.

1107
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,459
- Chorong...
- Let's try again.

1108
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,289
- Chorong.
- Chorong.

1109
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,760
It's Chorong.

1110
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,999
- Chodaeng?
- Yes! Let's go!

1111
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,329
- They already ran.
- No. It's our turn.

1112
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,629
- He came in third.
- It's our turn.

1113
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,669
- I figured it out.
- It's our turn.

1114
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,799
(Jong Min figures out the answer rather late.)

1115
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,840
What should I say?

1116
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,269
- All right. Hurry.
- Please. Just hurry up.

1117
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,146
DinDin, you have to guess. Just listen to your gut.

1118
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,440
Choryang? Chodan?

1119
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,349
- Cho...
- Let's distract him.

1120
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,350
Cho...

1121
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,290
- Distract him, Sebastian.
- Chorang.

1122
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,250
- It's wrong.
- Chorang?

1123
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,890
Wrong.

1124
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,790
- All right.
- It wasn't Chorang.

1125
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,720
It wasn't Chorong.

1126
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,160
- Then...
- Cholunny.

1127
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,700
My gosh. It's an easy one. If I get it right, it's over.

1128
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,329
If I get 4 questions right out of 10, I'll be in 1st place.

1129
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,230
- No!
- All right. Here it goes.

1130
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,769
Cho...

1131
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,016
(If he gets it right, he'll have 4 points.)

1132
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,740
It wasn't Chorang. Cho...

1133
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,879
- Choraeng.
- Yes. That's it.

1134
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,309
When he said "Chorang," you looked surprised. It's Choraeng.

1135
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,679
My gosh. He figured it out just by reading the situation?

1136
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,049
- I think it's Choraeng.
- He got it.

1137
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,180
- Choraeng.
- This is it.

1138
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,082
- I think it's Choraeng.
- He got it.

1139
00:38:40,414 --> 00:38:41,854
- He got it. This is it.
- Choraeng.

1140
00:38:42,693 --> 00:38:43,722
Correct.

1141
00:38:43,723 --> 00:38:44,762
(Choraeng is the right answer!)

1142
00:38:44,763 --> 00:38:46,322
- Come here.
- Gosh, I was so close.

1143
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:47,332
(Nobleman Se Yoon is in 1st place with a huge lead.)

1144
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,732
- I thought it was Chorong.
- My gosh. Well done.

1145
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:50,432
You're a fast runner. Great job.

1146
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:52,262
- You should've run faster!
- It's not that!

1147
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,302
- Sebastian.
- My gosh.

1148
00:38:53,303 --> 00:38:54,632
(Feeling wronged)

1149
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:57,033
- Gosh, I was so clever.
- How come you don't know anything?

1150
00:38:57,203 --> 00:38:58,483
Why are you taking it out on me?

1151
00:38:58,743 --> 00:39:00,242
You should've told me the answer.

1152
00:39:00,243 --> 00:39:03,273
I'm nothing but an animal who runs when you give me a signal.

1153
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:05,642
You were an animal?

1154
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,829
I go when you tell me to go. I stop when you tell me to stop.

1155
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:10,782
Choraeng Mask looks like it's smirking at us.

1156
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:12,452
It's an eccentric character...

1157
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:14,092
whose hobby is teasing noblemen and scholars.

1158
00:39:14,093 --> 00:39:16,299
I see. That's a fun mask. It kind of looks like a clown.

1159
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:17,363
Choraeng.

1160
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,863
If we get one more question right, we're safe.

1161
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:22,469
He said the quality of the meals depended on the scores.

1162
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,533
We can win second place.

1163
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:25,339
During the Joseon period, there were people...

1164
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,703
who were hired to take the beating in place of the nobles.

1165
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,402
This occupation was called...

1166
00:39:30,403 --> 00:39:32,203
- a substitute punishment receiver.
- I know.

1167
00:39:32,743 --> 00:39:35,712
How much money did they earn...

1168
00:39:35,713 --> 00:39:37,643
for taking 100 lashes?

1169
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:41,613
During the Joseon period, 1 yang cost 100 pun.

1170
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,653
- So 100 pun.
- So 100 pun equaled 1 yang.

1171
00:39:43,913 --> 00:39:47,292
A daily wage of a manual laborer...

1172
00:39:47,293 --> 00:39:48,653
was about 20 pun.

1173
00:39:48,893 --> 00:39:49,992
Then...

1174
00:39:49,993 --> 00:39:51,292
- So 1 yang equaled 100 pun?
- So 100 pun equaled 1 yang?

1175
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:52,962
- Yes.
- Their daily wage was 20 pun.

1176
00:39:52,963 --> 00:39:54,762
Yes. Then how much money...

1177
00:39:54,763 --> 00:39:56,592
did the substitute punishment receivers earn...

1178
00:39:56,593 --> 00:39:58,463
for taking 100 lashes?

1179
00:39:58,603 --> 00:40:00,903
But your backside would be torn after 100 lashes.

1180
00:40:01,003 --> 00:40:03,173
Right. You would have to risk your life for this job.

1181
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,702
Flogging must've been more painful than manual labor.

1182
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,613
- Right.
- They just have to guess this one.

1183
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:09,013
They have to guess.

1184
00:40:09,014 --> 00:40:10,912
(Let's run first.)

1185
00:40:10,913 --> 00:40:12,359
Will you tell us if our answer is higher or lower?

1186
00:40:12,383 --> 00:40:13,482
I will.

1187
00:40:13,483 --> 00:40:14,912
- Are you on board with this?
- Yes.

1188
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:15,953
(They agree.)

1189
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:19,323
(As the question is unfamiliar, farmhands run slowly.)

1190
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:21,452
All right. You were here first, so ring the bell.

1191
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:22,453
(Avoiding to ring it 1st)

1192
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:25,293
(Oh, yes!)

1193
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:26,422
What are you doing? Why did you ring it first?

1194
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:27,433
What?

1195
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,403
That fool, Lovely.

1196
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,133
(Laughing)

1197
00:40:33,703 --> 00:40:35,672
I just do whatever you tell me to do.

1198
00:40:35,673 --> 00:40:36,733
Come on.

1199
00:40:37,073 --> 00:40:39,843
- Remember what I told you?
- He's so slow.

1200
00:40:39,973 --> 00:40:41,942
Gosh, you're the slowest at figuring out what to do.

1201
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:43,212
He drives me crazy.

1202
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:44,213
(Thanks to Lovely, I got an extra turn.)

1203
00:40:44,214 --> 00:40:46,019
I'm glad we drew the snot on you. The snot mark suits you.

1204
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,413
I can't believe you rang it.

1205
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:49,083
I didn't know.

1206
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:52,852
Gosh, he's so frustrating. You're frustrating.

1207
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:53,952
(Frustrated)

1208
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:56,193
- For 100 lashes?
- Go with a big number.

1209
00:40:56,293 --> 00:40:57,763
They ought to earn a lot of money.

1210
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,323
- A hundred yang.
- A hundred yang? It's lower.

1211
00:41:00,963 --> 00:41:02,093
Thirty yang.

1212
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,403
Thirty yang? It's lower.

1213
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,532
"Please give me one pun."

1214
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:08,372
People teased each other by calling 7-pun brain or 8-pun brain.

1215
00:41:08,373 --> 00:41:10,233
- Right.
- It must be much lower.

1216
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:12,772
A manual laborer only earned 20 pun.

1217
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:13,843
Ten yang.

1218
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:15,873
Get ready to run.

1219
00:41:16,313 --> 00:41:17,613
And trip Sebastian.

1220
00:41:17,983 --> 00:41:19,012
Ten yang.

1221
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:20,212
(Getting ready to trip him)

1222
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:21,483
- Is it lower?
- Ten yang.

1223
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:23,913
It's lower.

1224
00:41:24,013 --> 00:41:25,682
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Let's go!

1225
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,593
(It's less than 10 yang. They're close to the right answer.)

1226
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,323
(The competition for the mission has gotten more fierce.)

1227
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,192
(Run fast!)

1228
00:41:33,193 --> 00:41:34,263
What are you doing?

1229
00:41:34,663 --> 00:41:35,663
Win second place.

1230
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:37,343
(Sebastian wins 1st place.)

1231
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:38,463
(Lovely wins 2nd place.)

1232
00:41:39,503 --> 00:41:40,773
Great job, Sebastian.

1233
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,032
Do a good job.

1234
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:43,103
This is your last chance.

1235
00:41:43,773 --> 00:41:44,803
Five yang!

1236
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:46,619
- That was my answer.
- Gosh, you should've said that.

1237
00:41:46,643 --> 00:41:48,243
- Please.
- Five yang.

1238
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,872
(5 yang)

1239
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:50,913
- It's higher.
- Gosh.

1240
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,112
(It's between 5 yang and 10 yang.)

1241
00:41:53,113 --> 00:41:54,353
We might get a chance.

1242
00:41:54,883 --> 00:41:55,883
Seven yang.

1243
00:41:56,983 --> 00:41:57,983
Seven yang.

1244
00:41:57,984 --> 00:41:59,682
"Seven yang." That's hard to say. It can never be that.

1245
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,843
(There's no way it's 7 yang.)

1246
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,822
- Seven yang.
- That's wrong.

1247
00:42:02,823 --> 00:42:04,362
(Farmhands are ready to run just in case.)

1248
00:42:04,363 --> 00:42:05,523
- I bet it's more.
- Correct.

1249
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,533
Gosh, Lovely!

1250
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:12,033
(A full bow)

1251
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:16,203
- Lovely.
- My lord.

1252
00:42:16,403 --> 00:42:19,042
- I raised you well, Lovely.
- My lord.

1253
00:42:19,043 --> 00:42:20,742
- Okay. Get up.
- Okay.

1254
00:42:20,743 --> 00:42:22,412
Get up. You're doing well.

1255
00:42:22,413 --> 00:42:23,512
- Okay.
- Right?

1256
00:42:23,513 --> 00:42:25,543
How much would that be in modern currency?

1257
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:28,452
That's 35 days' worth of labor. If you earn 100 dollars a day,

1258
00:42:28,453 --> 00:42:29,812
it would be about 3,500 dollars.

1259
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:32,153
Seven yang was a lot of money then.

1260
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,122
This was recorded...

1261
00:42:34,123 --> 00:42:35,592
in "Miscellaneous Records of Cheongseong..."

1262
00:42:35,593 --> 00:42:37,962
written by Seong Dae Joong from the late-Joseon period.

1263
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:39,562
It says in his book that a man died...

1264
00:42:39,563 --> 00:42:41,309
after being flogged 3 separate times in 1 day.

1265
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:42,933
- Who died?
- Three times in a row?

1266
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:45,162
- So he got 300 lashes?
- He got 300 lashes?

1267
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:47,123
- How can anyone endure 300 lashes?
- Here's why.

1268
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:49,432
- That's 35 days' worth of labor.
- Right.

1269
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,602
For a month...

1270
00:42:50,603 --> 00:42:52,072
He died after getting over 100 lashes.

1271
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:54,443
- He could've earned 21 yang.
- Right, 21 yang.

1272
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,053
Gosh, that must have been tough.

1273
00:42:56,643 --> 00:42:59,682
In the past, to tell time,

1274
00:42:59,683 --> 00:43:02,453
people used the Chinese zodiac hours.

1275
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,483
That's the one with 12 animals.

1276
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:06,853
What time period...

1277
00:43:07,223 --> 00:43:09,093
does the hour of the Monkey refer to?

1278
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:11,223
- The hour of the Monkey?
- Yes.

1279
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,663
Hey, run. Run fast!

1280
00:43:13,963 --> 00:43:15,732
(Sebastian comes in 1st.)

1281
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:17,532
- the hour of the Monkey or Dragon?
- Monkey.

1282
00:43:17,533 --> 00:43:18,602
Monkey.

1283
00:43:18,603 --> 00:43:20,933
(Bakumaru, Hols, Gao, Cream, rat, ox, tiger, rabbit)

1284
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:23,632
(The song Lovely is singing is...)

1285
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:25,502
(the soundtrack of "Juuni Senshi Bakuretsu Eto Ranger.")

1286
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:27,443
(An old cartoon centering around the 12 animals)

1287
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:29,312
(The order of the 12 animals)

1288
00:43:29,313 --> 00:43:31,142
(Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, )

1289
00:43:31,143 --> 00:43:32,223
(Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig)

1290
00:43:32,313 --> 00:43:35,453
(He learned about the animals thanks to his childhood education.)

1291
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,283
Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat...

1292
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,122
Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake,

1293
00:43:39,123 --> 00:43:40,893
- Horse, Goat...
- He has a lot of fingers.

1294
00:43:41,123 --> 00:43:43,092
(Monkey, Tart, Pochiro)

1295
00:43:43,093 --> 00:43:44,793
Wait. I figured out the answer.

1296
00:43:45,193 --> 00:43:46,722
I know the answer. If you watched...

1297
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:48,969
"Juuni Senshi Bakuretsu Eto Ranger," you'd know the answer.

1298
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,963
Don't tell them the answer.

1299
00:43:51,603 --> 00:43:53,063
- I got it.
- All right.

1300
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:56,872
- Hold on.
- Is it my turn?

1301
00:43:56,873 --> 00:43:58,342
- Look at me.
- We're third.

1302
00:43:58,343 --> 00:43:59,343
Do a good job.

1303
00:43:59,344 --> 00:44:00,703
Come on. You were good before.

1304
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:03,313
- Sebastian. What's wrong with you?
- Gosh.

1305
00:44:04,113 --> 00:44:05,742
Jong Min, do a good job.

1306
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:06,982
(Excited at the rare chance they have to win the point)

1307
00:44:06,983 --> 00:44:09,012
- Do the countdown!
- You were good before.

1308
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,153
I got it!

1309
00:44:10,713 --> 00:44:11,753
It's...

1310
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:13,983
It's excitement o'clock.

1311
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:16,093
Just say that once.

1312
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:18,092
Gosh, no. Hey!

1313
00:44:18,093 --> 00:44:19,422
(Go away, you annoying nobleman.)

1314
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,563
Do a good job.

1315
00:44:20,893 --> 00:44:24,663
It's between 3pm and 5pm.

1316
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,663
- I got it.
- Let me tell you why.

1317
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:29,132
I was born at 7:50am. But that was the hour of the Dragon.

1318
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,232
I got it.

1319
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:31,372
I was born in the morning.

1320
00:44:31,373 --> 00:44:32,373
(Kim Jong Min, born in the hour of the Dragon)

1321
00:44:32,374 --> 00:44:33,673
Jong Min, that's correct.

1322
00:44:34,443 --> 00:44:36,242
- What was the answer?
- Between 3pm and 5pm.

1323
00:44:36,243 --> 00:44:38,803
(He uses the secret behind his birth and gets the right answer.)

1324
00:44:38,983 --> 00:44:40,112
(Dancing)

1325
00:44:40,113 --> 00:44:41,313
That's in the afternoon.

1326
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:44,212
(Chinese zodiac time, the hour of the Monkey)

1327
00:44:44,213 --> 00:44:47,553
(Jong Min was born in the hour of the Dragon.)

1328
00:44:47,693 --> 00:44:50,552
Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat...

1329
00:44:50,553 --> 00:44:51,862
- And then Monkey.
- Monkey. It's 3pm.

1330
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:53,962
That's not important. The score is 2 to 1.

1331
00:44:53,963 --> 00:44:55,692
We just have to do well from now on. It's 2 to 1.

1332
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,362
- Who are you to lecture me?
- Well...

1333
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,962
- Nobleman, listen.
- Who are you to calm me down?

1334
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,072
- At times like this...
- Hey, nobleman.

1335
00:45:02,073 --> 00:45:04,073
If we get one more right, we'll be tied with them.

1336
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:05,402
- Okay. Hey!
- I'll do my best this time.

1337
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:08,042
- Sebastian, let's get out of here.
- We'll win if DinDin gets it right.

1338
00:45:08,043 --> 00:45:10,642
- Let's do our utmost this time.
- Sebastian, let's go.

1339
00:45:10,643 --> 00:45:11,643
(They still have a chance to place 1st.)

1340
00:45:11,644 --> 00:45:12,813
Here goes the question.

1341
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,613
"Sugungga" is...

1342
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:16,312
What is "Sugungga?"

1343
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:18,682
"Sugungga" is 1 of the 5 pansori stories...

1344
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:21,652
that is about a contest between a rabbit and a turtle,

1345
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:24,013
which is a satire on the society in the late Joseon period.

1346
00:45:24,493 --> 00:45:29,062
This song is a reinterpretation of the part in "Sugungga..."

1347
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:31,932
that describes the dignity of the tiger.

1348
00:45:31,933 --> 00:45:35,203
- It has an addictive beat...
- Go. Go now. Run.

1349
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:38,403
(They start running even before the question ends.)

1350
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,843
- Right now?
- I don't know the answer.

1351
00:45:41,213 --> 00:45:42,472
- I'll answer now.
- Go ahead.

1352
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,489
- "Tiger Is Coming."
- I think it's the right answer.

1353
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:47,753
The tiger is coming

1354
00:45:47,853 --> 00:45:50,313
- That's the song.
- That's the right answer.

1355
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,652
Who is the singer? You should guess the singer too.

1356
00:45:52,653 --> 00:45:54,253
- LEENALCHI.
- That's correct.

1357
00:45:54,493 --> 00:45:55,692
- Correct.
- The tiger is coming

1358
00:45:55,693 --> 00:45:58,693
("Tiger Is Coming")

1359
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,232
("Tiger Is Coming" by LEENALCHI)

1360
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:08,733
(A reinterpretation of "Sugungga" made to promote Korea)

1361
00:46:09,103 --> 00:46:12,573
(Dancing)

1362
00:46:12,843 --> 00:46:14,142
(DinDin and Lovely scored 1 point.)

1363
00:46:14,143 --> 00:46:16,863
- Nice. That was good. Good job.
- Had I known, I would've answered.

1364
00:46:17,213 --> 00:46:20,212
Let's move on. As for the next question...

1365
00:46:20,213 --> 00:46:21,889
Anyone would know the answer of this question.

1366
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:22,913
Anyone?

1367
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:25,453
Today is the 21st.

1368
00:46:25,553 --> 00:46:27,583
Se Yoon, it's my parents' wedding anniversary.

1369
00:46:28,293 --> 00:46:30,923
Who is the 21st king of the Joseon Dynasty?

1370
00:46:31,323 --> 00:46:34,863
Run! Run right now! That's good! Keep going!

1371
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:36,809
- Go, Sae Ho!
- Hey, I don't know the answer.

1372
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:37,933
Hey!

1373
00:46:39,303 --> 00:46:40,733
Go, Sae Ho!

1374
00:46:40,803 --> 00:46:44,743
(Falling down)

1375
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:47,202
(The heart-wrenching sacrifice of the farmhand)

1376
00:46:47,203 --> 00:46:48,512
- I don't know the answer.
- Right.

1377
00:46:48,513 --> 00:46:49,642
- Why don't you know?
- I don't know much about the kings.

1378
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:50,643
- Say the name of any king you know.
- The 21st king?

1379
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:52,042
- Just pick any king.
- Try to remember the kings.

1380
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:53,912
I failed to answer last time too. Whatever.

1381
00:46:53,913 --> 00:46:56,253
- I pick King Sejong.
- King Sejong?

1382
00:46:56,653 --> 00:46:58,653
- King Sejong?
- Let me answer!

1383
00:46:58,923 --> 00:47:00,783
King Sejong is the fourth king.

1384
00:47:01,023 --> 00:47:02,652
- I don't know much about the kings.
- Let me answer.

1385
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,792
- Let me answer first.
- No. That won't happen.

1386
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:06,769
- You should get this one right.
- I don't know the answer.

1387
00:47:06,793 --> 00:47:07,933
Here goes the answer.

1388
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:11,063
The 21st king is King Jeongjo.

1389
00:47:11,903 --> 00:47:13,063
King Jeongjo?

1390
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:15,332
It must be the correct answer. He memorized all the kings.

1391
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,333
- Incorrect.
- What?

1392
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,333
What?

1393
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,242
(Historian Kim is humiliated.)

1394
00:47:19,243 --> 00:47:20,343
Oh, he's the 22nd king.

1395
00:47:20,673 --> 00:47:23,072
(King Jeongjo is the 22nd king.)

1396
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:24,273
Gosh, seriously.

1397
00:47:24,813 --> 00:47:27,642
What? What's wrong? Are you all right?

1398
00:47:27,643 --> 00:47:28,652
(He was so upset that he fainted?)

1399
00:47:28,653 --> 00:47:30,652
Wake up. It's not over yet. Come on.

1400
00:47:30,653 --> 00:47:32,122
(Trying to remember the names of the kings)

1401
00:47:32,123 --> 00:47:34,352
- He's King Jeongjo's father, right?
- One...

1402
00:47:34,353 --> 00:47:35,599
He's King Jeongjo's father, right?

1403
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:37,992
King Jeongjo's father...

1404
00:47:37,993 --> 00:47:38,993
(He's King Jeongjo's grandfather.)

1405
00:47:38,994 --> 00:47:41,163
- Three, two, one.
- Answer now.

1406
00:47:41,593 --> 00:47:43,693
Time's up. Let's go! Run!

1407
00:47:44,293 --> 00:47:46,202
(Run, Sebastian!)

1408
00:47:46,203 --> 00:47:47,203
Why are you standing there? Run.

1409
00:47:47,204 --> 00:47:49,633
(Jong Min is the only one who knows the answer.)

1410
00:47:50,003 --> 00:47:56,013
(He'll get it right if Sebastian just rings the bell.)

1411
00:47:57,743 --> 00:48:00,513
(Lovely comes in 1st?)

1412
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:05,423
Why did you come in first when I skipped my turn?

1413
00:48:06,023 --> 00:48:07,153
You...

1414
00:48:08,893 --> 00:48:10,593
You're trying to humiliate me.

1415
00:48:11,023 --> 00:48:12,963
I skipped my turn to avoid being humiliated.

1416
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:15,093
You're trying to humiliate me.

1417
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:19,143
Joon made him say the answer when he couldn't answer just now.

1418
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,872
- He's trying to humiliate me.
- He made him look ignorant.

1419
00:48:22,873 --> 00:48:25,972
He must know the answer since he's a thoughtful celebrity.

1420
00:48:25,973 --> 00:48:27,573
- Give me a hint just once.
- Just once.

1421
00:48:27,803 --> 00:48:29,012
(DinDin asks him for a hint when their scores are both 2 points.)

1422
00:48:29,013 --> 00:48:30,412
Tell him the last syllable or something.

1423
00:48:30,413 --> 00:48:31,943
But we're tied right now.

1424
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:33,813
That's right. You shouldn't give him a hint.

1425
00:48:34,513 --> 00:48:35,552
- I'll say the answer.
- Give me a hint.

1426
00:48:35,553 --> 00:48:37,382
- It's either "jo" or "jong."
- Give me just one hint.

1427
00:48:37,383 --> 00:48:39,523
- Tell him which one it is.
- Give me just one hint.

1428
00:48:39,823 --> 00:48:40,883
Don't let them sway you.

1429
00:48:41,693 --> 00:48:43,933
Our score is 2 to 2, sir. You shouldn't give him a hint.

1430
00:48:43,993 --> 00:48:46,892
Give me a hint that would definitely help me.

1431
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:49,592
Don't do that. Why would you help him when we're tied?

1432
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,993
Tell him to shut it.

1433
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:52,362
Then I'll just tell you this.

1434
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:53,862
The 22nd king is King Jeongjo.

1435
00:48:53,863 --> 00:48:55,702
He lived the longest among all the kings. Am I right?

1436
00:48:55,703 --> 00:48:58,263
- The king who lived the longest?
- He lived the longest of all.

1437
00:48:58,503 --> 00:49:00,784
- He knows so much about history.
- How long did he live?

1438
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:02,242
He lived quite long.

1439
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:03,672
(Confident and relaxed)

1440
00:49:03,673 --> 00:49:05,242
Was he older than you when he passed?

1441
00:49:05,243 --> 00:49:07,212
He was much older than me. He was a grandpa.

1442
00:49:07,213 --> 00:49:09,112
- Really? Oh, I see.
- Yes, he lived long.

1443
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,913
Actually... Wait, no.

1444
00:49:11,883 --> 00:49:12,883
King Yeongjo.

1445
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:14,922
(DinDin answers, "King Yeongjo.")

1446
00:49:14,923 --> 00:49:16,753
(Jong Min faints again.)

1447
00:49:16,923 --> 00:49:19,022
The answer is King Yeongjo.

1448
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:22,933
- He reigned for a very long time.
- Wait.

1449
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:24,663
And King Yeongjo...

1450
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,823
locked his son up in a rice chest.

1451
00:49:27,433 --> 00:49:28,633
- Hey.
- After that,

1452
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:31,872
King Jeongjo got furious about it...

1453
00:49:31,873 --> 00:49:33,149
and turned the court upside down.

1454
00:49:33,173 --> 00:49:35,213
King Yeongjo is correct.

1455
00:49:36,213 --> 00:49:37,542
I got it right!

1456
00:49:37,543 --> 00:49:39,063
(The hint helped DinDin get it right.)

1457
00:49:39,683 --> 00:49:41,182
Why would he do that?

1458
00:49:41,183 --> 00:49:42,429
(Why did he give DinDin the hint?)

1459
00:49:42,453 --> 00:49:44,953
Jong Min. Oh, no. Jong Min is...

1460
00:49:45,123 --> 00:49:47,622
- King Jongjo is gone.
- He'll probably...

1461
00:49:47,623 --> 00:49:49,569
He'll probably die earlier than King Yeongjo did.

1462
00:49:49,593 --> 00:49:50,593
He's already gone.

1463
00:49:50,953 --> 00:49:53,392
King Jongjo, wake up. It's not over yet.

1464
00:49:53,393 --> 00:49:55,763
I remember now. King Yeongjo lived very long.

1465
00:49:56,433 --> 00:49:58,109
- Sae Ho, get up.
- I can't do this anymore.

1466
00:49:58,133 --> 00:50:00,333
I can't play any games with that nobleman anymore.

1467
00:50:01,063 --> 00:50:03,072
By giving DinDin a hint, Jong Min missed the chance...

1468
00:50:03,073 --> 00:50:04,742
- to place first.
- How many times...

1469
00:50:04,743 --> 00:50:06,049
You two will never get that chance.

1470
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:08,472
DinDin's score is 3 points. Se Yoon's is 4 points.

1471
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:09,812
And Jong Min's score is 2 points.

1472
00:50:09,813 --> 00:50:12,089
If DinDin gets the next one right, we'll be jointly in the lead.

1473
00:50:12,113 --> 00:50:13,233
I don't want that to happen.

1474
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,582
This time, I'll give you a nonsense quiz.

1475
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:17,252
Gosh. I'm not good at it.

1476
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:19,093
I'm not good at nonsense quizzes. I'm worried.

1477
00:50:19,423 --> 00:50:21,452
What is it called when a king wins?

1478
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:23,533
(Nonsense quiz: What is it called when a king wins?)

1479
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:25,463
- Is that it?
- What is it called?

1480
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:27,423
- Run.
- What's it called when a king wins?

1481
00:50:27,923 --> 00:50:29,832
(The noblemen don't seem to have any clue.)

1482
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:30,932
Gosh.

1483
00:50:30,933 --> 00:50:33,303
(Sebastian: 1st place, Hooray: 2nd place)

1484
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,873
When a king wins?

1485
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:36,433
The king crawls.

1486
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:38,272
(The king crawls?)

1487
00:50:38,273 --> 00:50:39,302
The king crawls.

1488
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:40,303
- I don't think...
- The king wins.

1489
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:42,242
I don't think he knows what nonsense quizzes are.

1490
00:50:42,243 --> 00:50:43,513
He is truly Young Forty.

1491
00:50:43,713 --> 00:50:44,713
Incorrect.

1492
00:50:44,714 --> 00:50:46,313
(King Jongjo has no wits.)

1493
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,513
Super-duper king.

1494
00:50:49,283 --> 00:50:50,283
Incorrect.

1495
00:50:50,883 --> 00:50:52,222
- I'll give you a hint.
- Okay.

1496
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:53,223
Does it have "king" in it?

1497
00:50:53,224 --> 00:50:55,069
- It doesn't have "king" in it.
- Joon, get ready to run.

1498
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:58,692
But it has the word that a king uses...

1499
00:50:58,693 --> 00:50:59,722
when he addresses himself.

1500
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,292
(A big hint has been given!)

1501
00:51:01,293 --> 00:51:02,392
Good!

1502
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,163
(Obstructing each other)

1503
00:51:04,803 --> 00:51:06,562
(DinDin and Joon: 3 points, Jong Min and Sae Ho: 2 points, )

1504
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,373
(Se Yoon and Seon Ho: 4 points)

1505
00:51:08,503 --> 00:51:11,843
(With 1 more point, DinDin and Joon will place 1st.)

1506
00:51:12,003 --> 00:51:13,103
He's really fast.

1507
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,203
Who is it?

1508
00:51:15,213 --> 00:51:16,343
He's really fast.

1509
00:51:16,843 --> 00:51:19,012
- Seon Ho failed to ring the bell.
- He's amazing.

1510
00:51:19,013 --> 00:51:20,759
- Nice. I rang the bell.
- He failed to ring the bell.

1511
00:51:20,783 --> 00:51:23,283
(It's Se Yoon's turn to answer.)

1512
00:51:23,453 --> 00:51:25,182
- A king calls himself "Jim."
- Three...

1513
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:27,329
- Isatjim as in "packed items?"
- What's wrong with him?

1514
00:51:27,353 --> 00:51:28,699
- I have no idea.
- What was that?

1515
00:51:28,723 --> 00:51:29,793
Incorrect.

1516
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,052
- Do you know the answer?
- Of course, I know.

1517
00:51:31,053 --> 00:51:32,492
- Of course, I know the answer.
- Let me answer.

1518
00:51:32,493 --> 00:51:35,032
- It's my turn.
- It's DinDin's turn now.

1519
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:37,109
(DinDin, the current 2nd place, has a chance to answer.)

1520
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:39,633
"Jim" is... "Jim..."

1521
00:51:39,703 --> 00:51:41,803
Jimmy Jib.

1522
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,003
(The camera crane?)

1523
00:51:45,073 --> 00:51:46,303
(Laughing)

1524
00:51:46,673 --> 00:51:49,642
(The farmhands are about to be worn out.)

1525
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:51,682
- My gosh. He said, "Jimmy Jib."
- That was witty.

1526
00:51:51,683 --> 00:51:53,242
- Incorrect.
- That was funny.

1527
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:54,343
"Jimmy Jib."

1528
00:51:54,953 --> 00:51:56,552
- Don't tell him the answer.
- Sae Ho gave Jong Min a hint.

1529
00:51:56,553 --> 00:51:57,952
Hit him with a wooden stick.

1530
00:51:57,953 --> 00:52:00,623
He doesn't know anyway.

1531
00:52:01,523 --> 00:52:03,693
(What did Sebastian just say?)

1532
00:52:04,023 --> 00:52:05,123
Look closely again.

1533
00:52:05,863 --> 00:52:06,863
Three...

1534
00:52:07,223 --> 00:52:08,892
- "Jim" wins. Jimiseung.
- They should run again.

1535
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:09,932
- Look closely at my mouth.
- Two.

1536
00:52:09,933 --> 00:52:12,063
(DinDin has caught on!)

1537
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:15,233
Run! Keep going! Hurry up.

1538
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:18,003
(If DinDin gets it right, he'll share 1st place with Se Yoon.)

1539
00:52:18,373 --> 00:52:20,942
- Run!
- Hurry up. What are you doing?

1540
00:52:20,943 --> 00:52:22,613
(Lovely comes in 1st.)

1541
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:25,782
- Joon came in first.
- What a fool.

1542
00:52:25,783 --> 00:52:27,613
(He still doesn't know the answer.)

1543
00:52:27,643 --> 00:52:28,652
Gosh, that fool.

1544
00:52:28,653 --> 00:52:32,653
I would go through fire and water to win.

1545
00:52:32,823 --> 00:52:35,523
- Jimseung as in "animal."
- I gave you a hint...

1546
00:52:35,593 --> 00:52:37,922
Film me with the Jimmy Jib.

1547
00:52:37,923 --> 00:52:39,922
Hey, why did you... I should've gotten it right.

1548
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,462
(Here comes the Jimmy Jib.)

1549
00:52:41,463 --> 00:52:43,032
Jimseung is correct.

1550
00:52:43,033 --> 00:52:45,132
(Jimseung is correct.)

1551
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:46,762
"Jimseung?"

1552
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:48,363
(Jim as in "king," seung as in "to win")

1553
00:52:48,473 --> 00:52:51,402
When he said "jimiseung," it gave me a hint.

1554
00:52:51,403 --> 00:52:53,249
(He read Sae Ho's lips and understood what it meant.)

1555
00:52:53,273 --> 00:52:55,212
That helped me think of the word "jimseung."

1556
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,213
(Jong Min helped DinDin get the right answer again.)

1557
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:59,843
I can't do this anymore. What could I do with that man?

1558
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:01,513
What is wrong with him?

1559
00:53:02,283 --> 00:53:04,783
All he does is eat and poop.

1560
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:08,082
He's "jimseung," an animal. What is "jimiseung?"

1561
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,052
As a result of the game...

1562
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,793
DinDin and Se Yoon will have a match to decide the winner.

1563
00:53:14,993 --> 00:53:16,863
- Here goes the last question.
- Okay.

1564
00:53:17,133 --> 00:53:19,732
Our team won't get a chance to answer the question anyway.

1565
00:53:19,733 --> 00:53:20,802
That's correct.

1566
00:53:20,803 --> 00:53:23,732
(Then I'll just take a nap.)

1567
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,149
Se Yoon, make sure to get this one right.

1568
00:53:25,173 --> 00:53:26,573
I will. Just run no matter what.

1569
00:53:27,573 --> 00:53:29,443
All right. Here goes the question.

1570
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,883
Yutnori, which we usually play on national holidays,

1571
00:53:33,183 --> 00:53:35,682
is a traditional game in which you throw four wooden sticks...

1572
00:53:35,683 --> 00:53:37,113
to win.

1573
00:53:37,383 --> 00:53:39,552
The combinations of the sides of the sticks that are facing up...

1574
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:41,592
are called do, gae, geol, yut, and mo.

1575
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,323
- That's right.
- They represent...

1576
00:53:43,393 --> 00:53:46,323
- five different animals.
- That's right.

1577
00:53:46,463 --> 00:53:49,032
What animal does yut represent?

1578
00:53:49,033 --> 00:53:50,093
I know the answer.

1579
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:52,073
- You know the answer, right?
- I have no idea.

1580
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,239
Se Yoon, you don't know the answer, do you?

1581
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,002
- I know the answer.
- Gae, geol, yut...

1582
00:53:55,003 --> 00:53:56,172
- Do, gae, geol...
- You don't know the answer, do you?

1583
00:53:56,173 --> 00:53:57,872
It must be one of many animals.

1584
00:53:57,873 --> 00:53:58,972
- Let's go for it.
- Take a wild guess.

1585
00:53:58,973 --> 00:54:00,502
- Are you sure, Se Yoon?
- You should take a wild guess.

1586
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,113
Ring the bell. Let's just go for it.

1587
00:54:02,213 --> 00:54:04,012
(DinDin doesn't know the answer either.)

1588
00:54:04,013 --> 00:54:06,182
Mo represents the fastest animal.

1589
00:54:06,183 --> 00:54:07,863
And yut represents the second fastest one.

1590
00:54:08,483 --> 00:54:09,913
Then, could it be a cheetah?

1591
00:54:11,113 --> 00:54:12,283
A cheetah is really fast.

1592
00:54:13,523 --> 00:54:14,723
Anaconda.

1593
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:15,992
Horse.

1594
00:54:15,993 --> 00:54:17,092
- No.
- Wrong.

1595
00:54:17,093 --> 00:54:19,762
- Why did you think of "horse?"
- Geol represents a horse.

1596
00:54:19,763 --> 00:54:21,263
- Horse?
- Mo represents a horse.

1597
00:54:21,363 --> 00:54:22,692
- Incorrect.
- You go ahead now.

1598
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:24,962
Do, gae, geol, yut, and mo.

1599
00:54:24,963 --> 00:54:26,302
The tiger is coming. The answer is tiger.

1600
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,402
(Yut, tiger)

1601
00:54:27,403 --> 00:54:28,533
Incorrect.

1602
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:29,832
It's okay. He doesn't know the answer.

1603
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,133
(None of them has a clue.)

1604
00:54:31,503 --> 00:54:32,503
Another kind of animal?

1605
00:54:32,504 --> 00:54:33,672
(Sebastian was simply watching them.)

1606
00:54:33,673 --> 00:54:36,413
- Do represents a pig.
- Right. Do represents a pig.

1607
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:39,843
(Sae Ho suddenly gives them a hint.)

1608
00:54:39,913 --> 00:54:42,253
- Gae represents a dog.
- Dog.

1609
00:54:42,383 --> 00:54:43,452
(Leaving right away)

1610
00:54:43,453 --> 00:54:46,253
Just push him.

1611
00:54:48,253 --> 00:54:49,552
Just make a turn around the turning point.

1612
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:50,553
(Se Yoon has the chance now.)

1613
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:52,893
It should be 1 of the 12 Chinese zodiac signs.

1614
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,162
(Yut)

1615
00:54:55,163 --> 00:54:56,233
Ox.

1616
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:57,932
- Ox?
- Ox?

1617
00:54:57,933 --> 00:54:58,933
Ox?

1618
00:54:59,203 --> 00:55:00,963
I think it's the answer.

1619
00:55:01,503 --> 00:55:02,672
- Ox?
- Ox.

1620
00:55:02,673 --> 00:55:03,802
(Yut is ox.)

1621
00:55:03,803 --> 00:55:04,963
- Ox.
- Is it not the answer?

1622
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,503
- Ox?
- Yes.

1623
00:55:08,313 --> 00:55:09,313
It's correct.

1624
00:55:09,314 --> 00:55:13,782
(Yut means ox, it is the answer.)

1625
00:55:13,783 --> 00:55:14,812
It's correct.

1626
00:55:14,813 --> 00:55:18,653
(Ending up in second place right at the brink of overtaking)

1627
00:55:19,053 --> 00:55:20,453
You got it right.

1628
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:22,763
So ox is 1 of the 12 Chinese zodiac signs.

1629
00:55:23,123 --> 00:55:25,163
What was your answer? Your answer was ox.

1630
00:55:25,463 --> 00:55:27,463
I think I remember it from some pictures.

1631
00:55:28,063 --> 00:55:29,462
I saw pictures of horses and oxen.

1632
00:55:29,463 --> 00:55:30,633
(Feeling regretful)

1633
00:55:30,933 --> 00:55:32,762
(How movement rules)

1634
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:34,532
(Do, gae, geol, yut, and mo)

1635
00:55:34,533 --> 00:55:36,332
(The order is set according to...)

1636
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,203
(the size and speed of farm animals.)

1637
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:40,779
This is the result of "Civil Service Exam by Proxy Bell Ringer."

1638
00:55:40,803 --> 00:55:44,172
Se Yoon and Hooray are in first place.

1639
00:55:44,173 --> 00:55:47,283
DinDin and Lovely are in second place.

1640
00:55:47,513 --> 00:55:50,953
Jong Min and Sebastian are in third place.

1641
00:55:51,823 --> 00:55:52,923
What's with your face?

1642
00:55:53,223 --> 00:55:55,722
(Are you really asking because you don’t know?)

1643
00:55:55,723 --> 00:55:56,992
Let’s get going for lunch.

1644
00:55:56,993 --> 00:55:59,323
- Okay, nice.
- Right now?

1645
00:55:59,463 --> 00:56:01,362
Okay, let's go. Hooray!

1646
00:56:01,363 --> 00:56:03,693
- Hooray!
- Let's go.

1647
00:56:04,463 --> 00:56:07,603
(Sebastian checks himself out as soon as he gets on the bus.)

1648
00:56:08,003 --> 00:56:10,333
(Hesitating)

1649
00:56:10,703 --> 00:56:12,503
Don't you think my makeup is too much?

1650
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:13,843
(Laughing)

1651
00:56:14,143 --> 00:56:16,313
I checked myself in the mirror in the bathroom.

1652
00:56:16,613 --> 00:56:18,383
I thought, "Did I put too much?"

1653
00:56:18,783 --> 00:56:21,112
- You look so strong.
- You're like a hunk.

1654
00:56:21,113 --> 00:56:22,782
I wish I could have done better with my eyebrows.

1655
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,482
- You actually look good.
- I shouldn't have put too much.

1656
00:56:24,483 --> 00:56:25,483
- You think so?
- Yes.

1657
00:56:25,484 --> 00:56:27,083
- Thank you.
- I connected the brows.

1658
00:56:27,553 --> 00:56:28,929
- What?
- I connected the brows for you.

1659
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:30,253
- You drew them for me.
- Right.

1660
00:56:30,623 --> 00:56:31,993
My nobleman.

1661
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:33,762
My nobleman.

1662
00:56:33,763 --> 00:56:35,392
I think the farmhand wouldn't feel too happy...

1663
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:38,033
if his nobleman is somewhat dull.

1664
00:56:38,763 --> 00:56:39,963
You know what I mean?

1665
00:56:40,403 --> 00:56:42,602
The farmhands would compare their noblemen.

1666
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:44,233
What would they say?

1667
00:56:44,803 --> 00:56:46,102
But for me,

1668
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,742
I met a great partner.

1669
00:56:47,743 --> 00:56:48,972
- You ended up in first place.
- That's right.

1670
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:50,712
- Good for you.
- It's been a long time since I won.

1671
00:56:50,713 --> 00:56:51,812
As the only winners here.

1672
00:56:51,813 --> 00:56:54,212
Look at my Lovely. He's having a wonderful time.

1673
00:56:54,213 --> 00:56:56,112
- They're equal.
- Right.

1674
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:57,453
Lovely and I are equal.

1675
00:56:57,913 --> 00:56:59,453
A farmhand like me...

1676
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:01,653
would be gone in his early 30s.

1677
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:03,722
(Feeling guilty)

1678
00:57:03,723 --> 00:57:04,883
He wouldn't be able to stand.

1679
00:57:05,163 --> 00:57:07,692
Is there a chance...

1680
00:57:07,693 --> 00:57:11,293
we can rise in status after having lunch?

1681
00:57:12,063 --> 00:57:14,332
Maybe you will have a chance to turn the tables.

1682
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:16,453
It would be nice if we could switch in the same team.

1683
00:57:16,703 --> 00:57:19,179
(A terrifying reversal of social status just the thought of it)

1684
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:20,349
You're holding back so much grudges already?

1685
00:57:20,373 --> 00:57:22,143
- Of course.
- He has hard feelings already.

1686
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,442
- Sebastian, what's wrong with you?
- I mean...

1687
00:57:24,443 --> 00:57:26,112
It's not like I have hard feelings. But I just have regrets.

1688
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:27,659
If I were Sae Ho, I would have changed the table already.

1689
00:57:27,683 --> 00:57:29,512
I'm very happy with what I have.

1690
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:31,012
Yes, you are lucky.

1691
00:57:31,013 --> 00:57:34,022
I think I'll be equally nice even if I become a nobleman.

1692
00:57:34,023 --> 00:57:35,192
(While holding onto the dream of rising in status)

1693
00:57:35,193 --> 00:57:36,499
- This place looks amazing.
- Hello.

1694
00:57:36,523 --> 00:57:37,622
- Hello.
- They have mackerels.

1695
00:57:37,623 --> 00:57:39,492
- Hello.
- They earned Blue Ribbons with it.

1696
00:57:39,493 --> 00:57:43,332
- It smells so good here.
- Se Yoon, come here. Sir.

1697
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:44,333
Goodness.

1698
00:57:44,593 --> 00:57:46,832
- Sir.
- I think this is my seat.

1699
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:47,902
- Goodness.
- Seon Ho.

1700
00:57:47,903 --> 00:57:48,903
(Andong Mackerel Full Set Meal)

1701
00:57:48,904 --> 00:57:51,972
The duo ended up in first place...

1702
00:57:51,973 --> 00:57:53,202
gets the full set meal.

1703
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:54,979
(The full set includes both braised and grilled mackerels.)

1704
00:57:55,003 --> 00:57:57,312
(The duo ended up in second place gets the salted mackerel set.)

1705
00:57:57,313 --> 00:57:59,033
- Lovely, this isn't bad.
- Hey, come here.

1706
00:57:59,183 --> 00:58:01,952
How can you go there before me? You have no manners.

1707
00:58:01,953 --> 00:58:03,593
- Get out of my way.
- This is your seat.

1708
00:58:04,353 --> 00:58:06,522
- I'm the nobleman.
- Sir, this is your seat.

1709
00:58:06,523 --> 00:58:07,803
Goodness, you should take seats.

1710
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:11,393
(Just a bowl of steamed barley rice and gochujang)

1711
00:58:11,493 --> 00:58:12,773
Goodness, you should take seats.

1712
00:58:13,063 --> 00:58:14,063
Excuse me.

1713
00:58:14,493 --> 00:58:15,792
(In denial from the shock)

1714
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:16,863
Goodness.

1715
00:58:17,493 --> 00:58:20,132
- Lovely, this isn't bad.
- Right.

1716
00:58:20,133 --> 00:58:21,402
Thanks to my hard work.

1717
00:58:21,403 --> 00:58:23,933
(A plate of salted mackerel is more than enough.)

1718
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,102
Since a long time ago,

1719
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:28,242
Andong is known for the salt-curing industry.

1720
00:58:28,243 --> 00:58:32,512
Salted mackerel was considered an essential dish...

1721
00:58:32,513 --> 00:58:34,882
for ancestral rites and for serving important guests.

1722
00:58:34,883 --> 00:58:36,843
(An essential dish served on important occasions)

1723
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,783
Gosh, how jealous.

1724
00:58:39,653 --> 00:58:42,423
Jong Min and Sebastian.

1725
00:58:42,553 --> 00:58:44,722
Your table looks a bit empty.

1726
00:58:44,723 --> 00:58:45,723
I brought something for you.

1727
00:58:45,724 --> 00:58:46,792
- Really?
- Yes.

1728
00:58:46,793 --> 00:58:48,193
But I'm a nobleman.

1729
00:58:50,663 --> 00:58:51,803
That's unbelievable.

1730
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:56,733
(A real-life cheapskate just showed up.)

1731
00:58:57,573 --> 00:59:01,843
It's the same thing as eating it.

1732
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:04,413
I think they can actually eat it.

1733
00:59:05,383 --> 00:59:07,112
This style is for cheapskates.

1734
00:59:07,113 --> 00:59:08,113
(They can only look at it.)

1735
00:59:08,114 --> 00:59:10,083
It would be salty if you look at it too much.

1736
00:59:10,253 --> 00:59:13,583
You can look at it once per one bite of rice.

1737
00:59:13,723 --> 00:59:15,323
Will you slap me if I look at it twice?

1738
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,593
- You can only look at it once.
- And...

1739
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:21,793
There is one rule for the meal for noblemen and farmhands.

1740
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:26,233
Farmhands can only eat the amount their noblemen share.

1741
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:29,673
Why would you go this far just because we chose the wrong gate?

1742
00:59:30,773 --> 00:59:32,943
Well, enjoy your meal now.

1743
00:59:33,643 --> 00:59:35,003
Let’s pick the side dishes my way.

1744
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:38,363
- I like this one too.
- Put them all in front of me.

1745
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:40,182
It's all for me.

1746
00:59:40,183 --> 00:59:42,183
(Moving side dishes)

1747
00:59:43,153 --> 00:59:44,182
That's for you.

1748
00:59:44,183 --> 00:59:45,503
(Sharing just the mackerel bones)

1749
00:59:45,723 --> 00:59:47,452
You actually worked hard. You ran...

1750
00:59:47,453 --> 00:59:48,653
- a lot.
- Right, I ran a lot.

1751
00:59:49,023 --> 00:59:50,222
I'll give you one piece.

1752
00:59:50,223 --> 00:59:52,692
(Sharing a big piece of salted mackerel)

1753
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:53,923
Continue working hard.

1754
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,492
(Feeling happy to have met a generous nobleman)

1755
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:57,893
- I will, sir.
- Let's eat now.

1756
00:59:58,193 --> 00:59:59,203
It looks delicious.

1757
01:00:00,203 --> 01:00:02,433
(Genuinely jealous)

1758
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,202
(Neatly deboning just the fishbone)

1759
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:07,803
Se Yoon, you're eating it the right way.

1760
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,613
(Taking a bite)

1761
01:00:13,483 --> 01:00:15,683
(Feeling very happy)

1762
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:17,312
I should eat the skin.

1763
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:20,183
(Putting it on top of warm rice)

1764
01:00:22,123 --> 01:00:23,822
(Taking a big bite)

1765
01:00:23,823 --> 01:00:25,463
Even the soup is amazing.

1766
01:00:27,723 --> 01:00:31,033
(The moist and tender flesh that he can feel in his mouth)

1767
01:00:31,463 --> 01:00:33,332
No wonder Andong is known for salted mackerels.

1768
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:34,963
(Feasting thanks to his great nobleman)

1769
01:00:35,133 --> 01:00:37,102
I'm very sensitive about the bones.

1770
01:00:37,103 --> 01:00:39,502
I can debone it like this.

1771
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:40,742
I see fishbones there.

1772
01:00:40,743 --> 01:00:43,049
- You can remove it while you eat.
- But the bone is here.

1773
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:44,342
I can remove it, look.

1774
01:00:44,343 --> 01:00:46,813
- Don't touch this part.
- Why not?

1775
01:00:47,113 --> 01:00:48,413
This is what you can eat.

1776
01:00:49,653 --> 01:00:52,152
Lovely, enjoy your meal.

1777
01:00:52,153 --> 01:00:54,422
What? We're one team.

1778
01:00:54,423 --> 01:00:55,753
Lovely, just eat first.

1779
01:00:55,923 --> 01:00:57,152
Sir.

1780
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,722
Shall I mix the rice for you?

1781
01:00:58,723 --> 01:00:59,793
Go ahead.

1782
01:01:00,293 --> 01:01:02,069
- I need more gochujang.
- No, you don't need to put in more.

1783
01:01:02,093 --> 01:01:03,213
You have a lot of rice here.

1784
01:01:03,563 --> 01:01:05,193
I'll give you your share.

1785
01:01:07,103 --> 01:01:08,972
(A tiny bit)

1786
01:01:08,973 --> 01:01:12,602
(Shaking)

1787
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:14,042
(Is this all you're giving?)

1788
01:01:14,043 --> 01:01:15,543
- Is this it?
- What do you mean?

1789
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:17,112
- Is it all you are sharing?
- That's a lot!

1790
01:01:17,113 --> 01:01:19,043
What are you doing? The amount of rice is...

1791
01:01:19,513 --> 01:01:20,942
You have so much here!

1792
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:23,453
(Exceptionally greedy)

1793
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,523
I guess it's seasoned well.

1794
01:01:26,923 --> 01:01:29,092
(The cheapskate nobleman taking a bite first)

1795
01:01:29,093 --> 01:01:30,752
How is it? Is it good?

1796
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,193
- No, it's very dry.
- Is it?

1797
01:01:33,063 --> 01:01:34,992
(His nobleman takes a bite first.)

1798
01:01:34,993 --> 01:01:37,293
(Then the farmhand takes his bite.)

1799
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:38,762
I look at it twice. You look at it once.

1800
01:01:38,763 --> 01:01:39,763
Yes, sir.

1801
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:43,872
(Even the cheapskates have their social status.)

1802
01:01:43,873 --> 01:01:44,903
Look at it only once.

1803
01:01:45,203 --> 01:01:47,373
(Shrinking back)

1804
01:01:48,643 --> 01:01:50,143
(Glancing)

1805
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:52,113
(Laughing)

1806
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:55,482
(Secretly glancing)

1807
01:01:55,483 --> 01:01:56,883
I told you to look at it only once.

1808
01:01:57,953 --> 01:01:59,873
I looked at it once when you looked at it twice.

1809
01:02:00,023 --> 01:02:01,252
(He has become the most miserable farmhand.)

1810
01:02:01,253 --> 01:02:02,923
(Full of lingering feelings)

1811
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:04,552
(Impressed)

1812
01:02:04,553 --> 01:02:05,723
My goodness.

1813
01:02:06,263 --> 01:02:07,822
(The rich men are having a feast with the braised mackerel.)

1814
01:02:07,823 --> 01:02:09,133
- Is that a mackerel?
- Gosh.

1815
01:02:09,363 --> 01:02:10,393
This is yours.

1816
01:02:11,163 --> 01:02:12,202
Are they having mackerel now?

1817
01:02:12,203 --> 01:02:13,232
Give me another plate.

1818
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:14,662
(The rich nobleman is sharing a bit of his food.)

1819
01:02:14,663 --> 01:02:17,533
- May I have a piece of radish?
- What? Radish?

1820
01:02:17,673 --> 01:02:19,043
- Goodness.
- Please.

1821
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:21,543
- All right.
- A piece of radish, please.

1822
01:02:22,013 --> 01:02:23,273
I'll work harder.

1823
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:26,042
Treat me just as nicely if our roles ever switch.

1824
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:27,143
Of course.

1825
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:32,452
(Carefully taking a bite of braised mackerel)

1826
01:02:32,453 --> 01:02:33,583
- It's so good.
- How is it?

1827
01:02:34,123 --> 01:02:36,253
There is no fishy smell in any part of the flesh.

1828
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,292
It's very well-seasoned as well.

1829
01:02:39,293 --> 01:02:42,332
The combination of the seasoning and the fish is amazing.

1830
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,533
That's a lot of flesh.

1831
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:46,703
(Glistening with juices)

1832
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:50,372
(Eyes wide open)

1833
01:02:50,373 --> 01:02:51,672
- What is this?
- Is it good?

1834
01:02:51,673 --> 01:02:52,972
Their braised mackerel must be their signature dish.

1835
01:02:52,973 --> 01:02:54,072
It's so good, isn't it?

1836
01:02:54,073 --> 01:02:55,193
This braised one is so good.

1837
01:02:55,343 --> 01:02:58,072
I love braised mackerels with aged kimchi, but this doesn't need one.

1838
01:02:58,073 --> 01:02:59,812
It's delicious, right?

1839
01:02:59,813 --> 01:03:01,182
- It's a very well-made dish.
- This is delicious.

1840
01:03:01,183 --> 01:03:02,382
I can't stop eating rice.

1841
01:03:02,383 --> 01:03:03,482
Stop looking at my mackerel.

1842
01:03:03,483 --> 01:03:04,883
(Stop looking at my mackerel.)

1843
01:03:05,853 --> 01:03:08,792
Andong has many local delicacies.

1844
01:03:08,793 --> 01:03:09,833
There are many delicacies.

1845
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:12,162
Beef bulgogi is one of their well-known dishes.

1846
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,222
I have to try their beef bulgogi.

1847
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:15,263
You should taste it since you're all in Andong.

1848
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:17,093
- Of course.
- Sure.

1849
01:03:17,563 --> 01:03:20,663
(A mini game for beef bulgogi)

1850
01:03:20,933 --> 01:03:23,672
Have you ever heard of a job called a salt-seasoner?

1851
01:03:23,673 --> 01:03:24,802
- Yes.
- A salt-seasoner.

1852
01:03:24,803 --> 01:03:26,973
I have. They salt fish.

1853
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:30,042
A salt-seasoner is known as a professional job in Andong...

1854
01:03:30,043 --> 01:03:31,872
who used to salt mackerels before.

1855
01:03:31,873 --> 01:03:33,013
It's someone who salts fish.

1856
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:36,352
They have to evenly spread the salt all over the fish.

1857
01:03:36,353 --> 01:03:38,883
It required advanced skills.

1858
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:42,123
This game is called Master of Salt-Seasoner.

1859
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:44,053
I like it.

1860
01:03:44,293 --> 01:03:46,662
It's important to get the right amount of salt...

1861
01:03:46,663 --> 01:03:48,663
with just your hand as a salt-seasoner.

1862
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:53,062
You win if you measure the salt on the scale...

1863
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:56,802
to match the grams I will set accurate to the decimal.

1864
01:03:56,803 --> 01:03:58,503
We can't get it to the decimal.

1865
01:03:59,103 --> 01:04:01,043
This game is for the three farmhands.

1866
01:04:01,443 --> 01:04:03,043
Lovely, go and play the game.

1867
01:04:03,743 --> 01:04:05,173
Just trust me.

1868
01:04:05,913 --> 01:04:08,043
Lovely owns a gym.

1869
01:04:08,953 --> 01:04:10,512
He knows how to weigh stuff.

1870
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,513
(Lovely can play this better because he knows how to weigh.)

1871
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,382
(Feeling desperate)

1872
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:14,922
Three farmhands, please start the game.

1873
01:04:14,923 --> 01:04:16,322
- Enjoy your game.
- Let's go.

1874
01:04:16,323 --> 01:04:18,252
- Run!
- I'll be back.

1875
01:04:18,253 --> 01:04:19,323
Bring the beef bulgogi.

1876
01:04:19,793 --> 01:04:22,193
If you win this game,

1877
01:04:23,163 --> 01:04:24,643
I’ll let you eat as much as you want.

1878
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:27,263
Stop eating and play the game!

1879
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:31,003
(Flustered)

1880
01:04:31,073 --> 01:04:32,872
Sebastian, if you don't win,

1881
01:04:32,873 --> 01:04:33,903
you get nothing.

1882
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:35,842
You don't even get to eat this. It's all mine.

1883
01:04:35,843 --> 01:04:37,389
(Farmhands being mistreated even before the game begins)

1884
01:04:37,413 --> 01:04:38,442
How can we even get this right?

1885
01:04:38,443 --> 01:04:40,712
- You might earn more.
- Well, now...

1886
01:04:40,713 --> 01:04:42,112
(Feeling resolute)

1887
01:04:42,113 --> 01:04:43,683
On each of your scales...

1888
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:45,653
Place your salt,

1889
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,822
and adjust it to 12g.

1890
01:04:47,823 --> 01:04:49,393
- Let's go!
- Lovely!

1891
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:51,323
- Let's go!
- Lovely!

1892
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:55,533
Feel the air, Sae Ho. The weight of the air.

1893
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:58,463
(The nerves gather at his fingertips.)

1894
01:04:59,033 --> 01:05:01,263
(He carefully gets a handful of salt.)

1895
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:04,303
I have the feeling now.

1896
01:05:05,803 --> 01:05:09,573
(Sebastian places the salt on the scale with his feeling.)

1897
01:05:11,943 --> 01:05:14,683
(It's close to 12g.)

1898
01:05:14,943 --> 01:05:16,783
- Hold on.
- Raise your hand when you're done.

1899
01:05:17,653 --> 01:05:18,753
Twelve?

1900
01:05:19,823 --> 01:05:20,823
Yes. Twelve.

1901
01:05:20,824 --> 01:05:22,193
(He gets a sudden hunch.)

1902
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,653
Boldly. Carefully yet boldly.

1903
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:28,763
(He carefully and boldly places a handful of salt.)

1904
01:05:28,933 --> 01:05:30,792
- Remember it.
- Remember it from earlier.

1905
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,833
(He's in super-focused mode.)

1906
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:36,673
(The weight keeps increasing.)

1907
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:38,402
This is also weight, Lovely.

1908
01:05:38,403 --> 01:05:40,073
Imagine you're lifting weights.

1909
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:43,413
(Wrestling with running nose)

1910
01:05:45,783 --> 01:05:48,013
(He focuses with his eyes closed.)

1911
01:05:51,383 --> 01:05:54,823
(He chooses the strategy of adding small amounts at a time.)

1912
01:05:54,923 --> 01:05:56,952
You have to feel every gram of the weight.

1913
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,253
Stop talking.

1914
01:05:59,323 --> 01:06:02,163
(Will the farmhands be able to place exactly 12g?)

1915
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:03,993
Raise your hand when you're done.

1916
01:06:04,993 --> 01:06:06,162
I think I have it.

1917
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:07,733
- I also have it.
- Let's go, Sae Ho.

1918
01:06:08,203 --> 01:06:09,373
Let's go, Sebastian.

1919
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:11,873
- Lovely would be sure.
- Put your hands away now.

1920
01:06:12,173 --> 01:06:13,302
I'm not sure.

1921
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:14,649
- I just went with my feeling.
- Do we have a winner?

1922
01:06:14,673 --> 01:06:16,843
I'll tell you how it is now.

1923
01:06:17,973 --> 01:06:19,082
Sebastian...

1924
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:20,482
(How much does Sebastian's salt weigh?)

1925
01:06:20,483 --> 01:06:23,452
It's at 16.9g now.

1926
01:06:23,453 --> 01:06:24,913
Why did you put so much?

1927
01:06:25,283 --> 01:06:26,752
Why did you put so much?

1928
01:06:26,753 --> 01:06:27,829
(He scolds him immediately.)

1929
01:06:27,853 --> 01:06:29,723
- It's 16.9g.
- Then, Hooray...

1930
01:06:30,393 --> 01:06:32,723
Sae Ho almost grabbed a kilogram.

1931
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,893
Hooray's is 13.9g.

1932
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,792
- You had to lose some.
- I had to remove some.

1933
01:06:38,793 --> 01:06:40,113
- I had to remove some.
- Then...

1934
01:06:41,003 --> 01:06:42,003
Then...

1935
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:44,672
- His...
- Lovely.

1936
01:06:44,673 --> 01:06:46,603
(If his is 12g, he gets beef bulgogi.)

1937
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:49,112
(How much does Lovely's salt weigh?)

1938
01:06:49,113 --> 01:06:50,343
Lovely's...

1939
01:06:51,573 --> 01:06:52,682
- He...
- is 8.2g.

1940
01:06:52,683 --> 01:06:54,613
What are you doing?

1941
01:06:54,813 --> 01:06:57,013
- What are you doing?
- It's not even close.

1942
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:58,922
What are you doing?

1943
01:06:58,923 --> 01:06:59,963
(It's a complete failure.)

1944
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,953
Just look at Seon Ho and do what he's doing.

1945
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,653
Give us one more chance.

1946
01:07:05,223 --> 01:07:07,562
Since you all failed, I'll give you one last chance.

1947
01:07:07,563 --> 01:07:09,392
- This is the last chance.
- Do we remove the salt from here?

1948
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:13,203
Add or remove the salt on your scales...

1949
01:07:13,303 --> 01:07:16,573
and make it as close to 12g as possible.

1950
01:07:16,903 --> 01:07:18,532
- That person gets beef bulgogi.
- Remove just a little.

1951
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:20,673
- What was mine? It was 16...
- It's 16.9.

1952
01:07:20,743 --> 01:07:23,242
- Since it's 16.9g...
- Hey.

1953
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:25,682
- It's 4.25g. Okay.
- Divide this into 4.

1954
01:07:25,683 --> 01:07:28,812
You can remove a little more than a quarter of it.

1955
01:07:28,813 --> 01:07:30,052
I have to remove 4.25g.

1956
01:07:30,053 --> 01:07:31,853
Divide it and add more.

1957
01:07:32,383 --> 01:07:34,222
Divide it. You can guess the amount.

1958
01:07:34,223 --> 01:07:36,123
You need to use your senses from there.

1959
01:07:36,523 --> 01:07:38,652
Hooray.

1960
01:07:38,653 --> 01:07:40,823
This is almost ours. We are almost there.

1961
01:07:41,363 --> 01:07:44,333
(Hooray removes little bits of salt.)

1962
01:07:44,363 --> 01:07:47,403
(It reaches 12.8g.)

1963
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,503
Divide it and add more.

1964
01:07:50,003 --> 01:07:51,072
Divide it.

1965
01:07:51,073 --> 01:07:53,342
- You can guess the amount.
- Wait.

1966
01:07:53,343 --> 01:07:55,443
- You're so noisy.
- Use your senses.

1967
01:07:55,743 --> 01:07:59,283
(Lovely's was 8.2g.)

1968
01:07:59,613 --> 01:08:03,253
(His hands are bolder than before.)

1969
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:06,622
(It reaches 10.8g.)

1970
01:08:06,623 --> 01:08:07,982
- Lovely.
- It's 16.9g,

1971
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:08,983
so I divided it into four.

1972
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:10,892
- Divide it...
- Remove just a little bit more.

1973
01:08:10,893 --> 01:08:12,022
I have to remove 4.25g.

1974
01:08:12,023 --> 01:08:14,963
Lovely. First, do it similarly...

1975
01:08:15,163 --> 01:08:17,062
First, do it similarly to Seon Ho's.

1976
01:08:17,063 --> 01:08:18,369
(The nobleman's advice is only a distraction.)

1977
01:08:18,393 --> 01:08:19,663
He talks so much.

1978
01:08:21,103 --> 01:08:23,103
How did farmhands live back in the day?

1979
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:25,473
Don't talk and just do it.

1980
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:28,042
Let's eat beef, Sebastian.

1981
01:08:28,043 --> 01:08:29,603
(Sebastian is still dividing the salt.)

1982
01:08:30,013 --> 01:08:32,073
I'll give you some when you win this.

1983
01:08:32,913 --> 01:08:35,013
Be sensitive and detailed.

1984
01:08:35,183 --> 01:08:37,282
- I'm done.
- Bring up all your senses.

1985
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:40,252
Think about it again.

1986
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:41,752
- I have a good feeling now.
- Really?

1987
01:08:41,753 --> 01:08:42,922
- Yes.
- You had a good feeling earlier,

1988
01:08:42,923 --> 01:08:44,053
but it weighed 16.9g.

1989
01:08:44,193 --> 01:08:45,722
Don't worry.

1990
01:08:45,723 --> 01:08:47,962
Don't touch it from now on.

1991
01:08:47,963 --> 01:08:49,663
I'll announce the result.

1992
01:08:50,163 --> 01:08:51,432
Sae Ho would come last.

1993
01:08:51,433 --> 01:08:52,602
Master salt-seasoner.

1994
01:08:52,603 --> 01:08:54,503
(They're nervous.)

1995
01:08:54,863 --> 01:08:56,202
- Sebastian.
- Sebastian.

1996
01:08:56,203 --> 01:08:57,272
I think he's going to make it.

1997
01:08:57,273 --> 01:08:58,349
(Sebastian's weight is revealed first.)

1998
01:08:58,373 --> 01:09:00,002
I guess I didn't do well.

1999
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:01,273
What's wrong with you?

2000
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:04,443
Yours is 11...

2001
01:09:04,543 --> 01:09:06,713
Amazing.

2002
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,983
Really?

2003
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:09,752
It's 11.3g.

2004
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:11,613
He did well.

2005
01:09:11,753 --> 01:09:12,882
- That's close.
- That was close.

2006
01:09:12,883 --> 01:09:14,582
- You removed 7g.
- Then...

2007
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,153
(It's a difference of 0.7g.)

2008
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:17,892
Seon Ho.

2009
01:09:17,893 --> 01:09:19,162
(The weight of Hooray's salt is...)

2010
01:09:19,163 --> 01:09:21,893
- Ten...
- It's 11.6g.

2011
01:09:22,693 --> 01:09:24,293
It's okay, Lovely.

2012
01:09:24,433 --> 01:09:27,303
I think yours will be 12.3g.

2013
01:09:27,533 --> 01:09:30,403
(Hooray won against Sebastian.)

2014
01:09:30,473 --> 01:09:32,843
If you lose, you'll also eat from there.

2015
01:09:33,643 --> 01:09:35,672
If you don't get this right,

2016
01:09:35,673 --> 01:09:37,013
don't think of coming home today.

2017
01:09:37,713 --> 01:09:38,973
You have to stand outside.

2018
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:40,482
- Lovely.
- Lovely.

2019
01:09:40,483 --> 01:09:42,159
(Which farmhand will earn the beef bulgogi out of the two?)

2020
01:09:42,183 --> 01:09:43,452
It's 11...

2021
01:09:43,453 --> 01:09:45,052
- It's 11...
- Really?

2022
01:09:45,053 --> 01:09:46,083
Eight.

2023
01:09:48,402 --> 01:09:50,251
You have to stand outside.

2024
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,522
- Lovely.
- Lovely.

2025
01:09:52,092 --> 01:09:53,161
Lovely!

2026
01:09:53,162 --> 01:09:55,362
- It's 11.8g.
- Lovely!

2027
01:09:55,532 --> 01:09:58,092
(Lovely earns the beef bulgogi.)

2028
01:09:58,732 --> 01:10:00,931
(It was just a difference of 0.2g.)

2029
01:10:00,932 --> 01:10:02,732
Well done, Lovely.

2030
01:10:02,902 --> 01:10:04,072
Well done, Lovely.

2031
01:10:04,272 --> 01:10:08,042
Goodness, Lovely. I brought in a good farmhand.

2032
01:10:08,172 --> 01:10:11,171
- Lovely.
- You need to get a good farmhand.

2033
01:10:11,172 --> 01:10:13,782
You need to get a good farmhand for the household to prosper.

2034
01:10:14,442 --> 01:10:17,752
I would have won if it were the noblemen doing it.

2035
01:10:18,212 --> 01:10:19,922
If that's okay,

2036
01:10:21,122 --> 01:10:22,392
can I eat this?

2037
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:25,092
- You can take it.
- We can eat this.

2038
01:10:25,322 --> 01:10:26,922
- Is there anything to eat?
- Nice.

2039
01:10:27,092 --> 01:10:28,122
Nice.

2040
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:31,291
- Where did my side dishes go?
- You need to work out.

2041
01:10:31,292 --> 01:10:33,032
(They're in my stomach.)

2042
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:35,932
Lovely can choose to eat the beef bulgogi...

2043
01:10:36,132 --> 01:10:38,732
alone or with the nobleman.

2044
01:10:39,242 --> 01:10:40,242
What does that mean?

2045
01:10:40,243 --> 01:10:41,341
(His eyes are shaking.)

2046
01:10:41,342 --> 01:10:43,842
- What does that mean?
- The farmhand earned it.

2047
01:10:44,612 --> 01:10:45,612
That looks good.

2048
01:10:45,613 --> 01:10:46,733
(Beef bulgogi is coming in.)

2049
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:50,312
(The representative K-food, beef bulgogi)

2050
01:10:50,812 --> 01:10:53,922
Let me taste it.

2051
01:10:54,222 --> 01:10:56,092
The nobleman is right next to him.

2052
01:10:57,192 --> 01:10:59,762
He's checking whether there's poison.

2053
01:11:01,592 --> 01:11:03,631
(This is the taste!)

2054
01:11:03,632 --> 01:11:04,831
Does it go down smoothly?

2055
01:11:04,832 --> 01:11:08,301
It has the taste of traditional folk village.

2056
01:11:08,302 --> 01:11:09,402
(He's excited.)

2057
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:10,602
- Lovely.
- Yes?

2058
01:11:11,232 --> 01:11:12,741
(You're not going eat it alone, right?)

2059
01:11:12,742 --> 01:11:14,601
Look at the amount of mackerel you've eaten.

2060
01:11:14,602 --> 01:11:15,912
Let me eat once more.

2061
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:18,541
We've been equal today. Look how much you've eaten.

2062
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:19,742
(We've been doing well today.)

2063
01:11:20,712 --> 01:11:23,282
You can eat half of it, then.

2064
01:11:23,382 --> 01:11:24,882
Lovely.

2065
01:11:25,052 --> 01:11:26,851
We're equal.

2066
01:11:26,852 --> 01:11:28,992
- Let's split it.
- Thank you.

2067
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:32,051
It doesn't matter whether I'm a nobleman or a farmhand.

2068
01:11:32,052 --> 01:11:33,661
I don't act stingy...

2069
01:11:33,662 --> 01:11:35,632
- with food.
- Nice.

2070
01:11:35,692 --> 01:11:37,362
You need to bring in a good farmhand.

2071
01:11:38,532 --> 01:11:39,961
You have to meet a good master.

2072
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,202
(Staring)

2073
01:11:41,732 --> 01:11:43,272
- Sebastian.
- Yes.

2074
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,171
Can you do 1 kick and 2 kicks?

2075
01:11:45,172 --> 01:11:46,342
I can.

2076
01:11:46,742 --> 01:11:48,302
- You can do one kick?
- One kick...

2077
01:11:48,602 --> 01:11:49,642
Hey.

2078
01:11:49,942 --> 01:11:52,212
Nice.

2079
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:53,482
Nice.

2080
01:11:53,483 --> 01:11:54,763
(A talent show for beef bulgogi)

2081
01:11:55,442 --> 01:11:57,512
(One kick)

2082
01:11:59,052 --> 01:12:00,751
(The kick made a heavy sound.)

2083
01:12:00,752 --> 01:12:01,981
Sebastian.

2084
01:12:01,982 --> 01:12:03,322
It looks painful.

2085
01:12:04,622 --> 01:12:05,961
- I did it.
- Sebastian.

2086
01:12:05,962 --> 01:12:06,992
Yes.

2087
01:12:07,092 --> 01:12:08,762
- Bring your bowl.
- Goodness.

2088
01:12:08,862 --> 01:12:10,731
- The sound of the fall was loud.
- Thank you.

2089
01:12:10,732 --> 01:12:12,031
- Sebastian.
- I'll give you half of this.

2090
01:12:12,032 --> 01:12:13,362
- Okay.
- Sebastian?

2091
01:12:14,062 --> 01:12:15,062
Sebastian?

2092
01:12:15,572 --> 01:12:17,171
- Your master isn't eating.
- Sebastian.

2093
01:12:17,172 --> 01:12:18,231
Bring it here.

2094
01:12:18,232 --> 01:12:19,372
(Quickly bring it here.)

2095
01:12:19,442 --> 01:12:21,741
- I'll give you this much, okay?
- Thank you.

2096
01:12:21,742 --> 01:12:24,142
- Come here!
- All right.

2097
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:26,511
You have to eat it alone.

2098
01:12:26,512 --> 01:12:27,841
He tells me to eat it alone.

2099
01:12:27,842 --> 01:12:29,681
I'm your master.

2100
01:12:29,682 --> 01:12:30,682
(How dare you?)

2101
01:12:31,282 --> 01:12:33,082
- Hey.
- If you do one kick...

2102
01:12:33,322 --> 01:12:35,892
I'll give you half of this if you do one kick.

2103
01:12:36,092 --> 01:12:38,222
- If you do one kick...
- I'm your master.

2104
01:12:40,062 --> 01:12:42,762
(I don't need to keep my dignity.)

2105
01:12:43,162 --> 01:12:44,262
(Laughing)

2106
01:12:44,392 --> 01:12:47,132
Is the nobleman dancing in front of the farmhand?

2107
01:12:47,932 --> 01:12:50,802
(The dignity of the nobleman falls in front of beef bulgogi.)

2108
01:12:50,972 --> 01:12:53,072
(Seized by madness)

2109
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,872
(Sebastian is satisfied.)

2110
01:12:55,172 --> 01:12:56,572
- You can have half of this.
- Yes.

2111
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,342
Eat this.

2112
01:12:58,912 --> 01:13:00,982
(Taking a big bite)

2113
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:06,582
(It was worth losing my dignity.)

2114
01:13:06,752 --> 01:13:08,181
- I finished a bowl in no time.
- Thank you for the food.

2115
01:13:08,182 --> 01:13:09,952
Mackerel tastes so good.

2116
01:13:10,522 --> 01:13:12,221
Are you full, Sae Ho and Jong Min?

2117
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:13,961
- I'm full.
- That's a relief.

2118
01:13:13,962 --> 01:13:15,192
- I'm so full.
- I'm hungry.

2119
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:16,632
I'm getting gassy.

2120
01:13:17,362 --> 01:13:18,391
Gorilla.

2121
01:13:18,392 --> 01:13:20,332
(Farmhand Sebastian is still hungry.)

2122
01:13:20,432 --> 01:13:21,462
I'm full.

2123
01:13:21,562 --> 01:13:23,502
It was good.

2124
01:13:25,172 --> 01:13:26,772
The farmhands are sitting first.

2125
01:13:29,372 --> 01:13:31,741
I should warm up your seat.

2126
01:13:31,742 --> 01:13:32,782
That's right.

2127
01:13:33,612 --> 01:13:35,382
This outfit is so uncomfortable.

2128
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:37,712
- Would you like to switch?
- What?

2129
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:40,582
- I mean...
- Be quiet.

2130
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:42,122
I just made a suggestion.

2131
01:13:42,522 --> 01:13:44,722
- Don't be happy.
- Hey, stay standing.

2132
01:13:45,722 --> 01:13:47,622
- Come here.
- Stay standing.

2133
01:13:47,962 --> 01:13:49,491
- Sorry, sir.
- Sorry, sir.

2134
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:50,692
"Stay standing."

2135
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:52,801
There are no seats for you. You have to stand.

2136
01:13:52,802 --> 01:13:53,831
(They head somewhere like that.)

2137
01:13:53,832 --> 01:13:56,172
- What?
- This is it! The famous spot.

2138
01:13:56,902 --> 01:14:00,442
(In front of the famous Andong Station)

2139
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:04,272
(This is exciting.)

2140
01:14:04,472 --> 01:14:06,581
- Was it a vow in vain - Was it a vow in vain

2141
01:14:06,582 --> 01:14:08,741
How dare you sing when the gentlemen are singing?

2142
01:14:08,742 --> 01:14:10,058
Of course, I must sing with them.

2143
01:14:10,082 --> 01:14:12,782
Sebastian, sing us some trot.

2144
01:14:13,522 --> 01:14:15,221
Or do what you're good at. Making your own songs.

2145
01:14:15,222 --> 01:14:16,622
- My own song?
- Yes.

2146
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,552
Sing "Life of a Farmhand."

2147
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:20,321
- "Life of a Servant."
- "Life of a Servant."

2148
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:21,422
"Life of a Servant."

2149
01:14:22,732 --> 01:14:26,902
(I open my eyes and morning has come)

2150
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:30,201
(Night has come in a flash)

2151
01:14:30,202 --> 01:14:31,432
Gosh, it's sad.

2152
01:14:31,572 --> 01:14:34,092
(A song with the deep emotions of what was felt during the day)

2153
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:37,072
(The servant eats time once again today)

2154
01:14:37,312 --> 01:14:39,681
(I am not able to eat food)

2155
01:14:39,682 --> 01:14:41,011
"Life of a Servant."

2156
01:14:41,012 --> 01:14:42,211
- That's nice.
- "Eats time."

2157
01:14:42,212 --> 01:14:43,411
"I am not able to eat food."

2158
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:44,781
- I have a title suggestion.
- Right.

2159
01:14:44,782 --> 01:14:46,151
"I am Sebastian."

2160
01:14:46,152 --> 01:14:48,452
- "I am Sebastian."
- It must have some English in it.

2161
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:54,822
(The name my mom called me)

2162
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:59,632
(The name my dad called me when looking for me)

2163
01:15:00,332 --> 01:15:04,232
(This fellow is quite the singer.)

2164
01:15:04,672 --> 01:15:07,741
(I am "Sebastian.")

2165
01:15:07,742 --> 01:15:09,441
That's a great talent.

2166
01:15:09,442 --> 01:15:10,648
(He feels proud about his farmhand.)

2167
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:11,871
- "Sebastian."
- "Sebastian."

2168
01:15:11,872 --> 01:15:13,682
- That was a great set of lines.
- Was it?

2169
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:15,212
Great work.

2170
01:15:15,912 --> 01:15:18,112
The nobleman is the worst here.

2171
01:15:18,552 --> 01:15:20,352
I'm disappointed I can't get more out of you.

2172
01:15:20,652 --> 01:15:22,921
If Nolbu were alive in our current generation,

2173
01:15:22,922 --> 01:15:24,352
it would be Jong Min.

2174
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:27,361
- He must've looked just like him.
- The smile he has...

2175
01:15:27,362 --> 01:15:28,791
and that look of his.

2176
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:31,832
Nobleman Moon must be eyeing Sebastian.

2177
01:15:32,192 --> 01:15:34,901
Sebastian would be great. Actually,

2178
01:15:34,902 --> 01:15:37,382
I want to have Nobleman DinDin and Nobleman Jong Min under me.

2179
01:15:37,932 --> 01:15:39,242
- What?
- Why me?

2180
01:15:39,572 --> 01:15:41,172
I would tear out their mouths.

2181
01:15:41,672 --> 01:15:44,441
When will our status change?

2182
01:15:44,442 --> 01:15:45,712
I think it will change soon.

2183
01:15:45,882 --> 01:15:47,511
- It's time for that change.
- When will things change?

2184
01:15:47,512 --> 01:15:48,612
There must be no change.

2185
01:15:48,782 --> 01:15:51,063
- You have to earn it.
- The noblemen will stay the same.

2186
01:15:51,282 --> 01:15:53,421
When I get a new status,

2187
01:15:53,422 --> 01:15:55,181
- I can be very kind.
- Right.

2188
01:15:55,182 --> 01:15:57,222
- I'll be nice and make things fair.
- Right.

2189
01:15:57,992 --> 01:15:58,992
(Thinking)

2190
01:15:58,993 --> 01:16:01,362
You can still keep your hopes up.

2191
01:16:01,592 --> 01:16:03,861
It's going to be tough. Will it be like this...

2192
01:16:03,862 --> 01:16:05,492
until we go home tomorrow?

2193
01:16:05,632 --> 01:16:06,961
- Tomorrow...
- Even when we sleep?

2194
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:09,171
What if the farmhands have to escort the noblemen home?

2195
01:16:09,172 --> 01:16:10,801
- Gosh!
- What if the farmhands...

2196
01:16:10,802 --> 01:16:12,441
are woken up during their sleep? That's the worst.

2197
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:14,002
(Just the thought of it is depressing.)

2198
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:17,112
Stay in reality and don't be imagining things.

2199
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:20,241
- Yes, sir.
- Don't expand your world.

2200
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,682
I thought the same thing.

2201
01:16:21,842 --> 01:16:24,011
Gosh, the name of this place is Yekki Village.

2202
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,422
Gosh, the water is so blue. Check that out.

2203
01:16:26,822 --> 01:16:29,121
(A place with a peaceful forest path...)

2204
01:16:29,122 --> 01:16:32,492
(and clear wind)

2205
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:36,092
(The time of tradition flows slowly here...)

2206
01:16:36,462 --> 01:16:38,231
(and it possesses the scenery of the Joseon period.)

2207
01:16:38,232 --> 01:16:40,101
This place has the beautiful nature of Andong...

2208
01:16:40,102 --> 01:16:41,932
and brilliance of traditional hanoks.

2209
01:16:42,202 --> 01:16:44,401
It's called the Seonseonghyeon Cultural Complex.

2210
01:16:44,402 --> 01:16:46,742
(Seonseonghyeon Cultural Complex)

2211
01:16:46,972 --> 01:16:48,271
Let's move, everyone.

2212
01:16:48,272 --> 01:16:51,112
(They arrive at their destination while walking by the fall foliage.)

2213
01:16:51,472 --> 01:16:52,742
Gosh, what is this?

2214
01:16:52,842 --> 01:16:54,042
Gosh.

2215
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:56,411
- It's placed across the river.
- Right.

2216
01:16:56,412 --> 01:16:57,811
- It's incredible.
- It looks amazing.

2217
01:16:57,812 --> 01:16:59,252
How is this possible?

2218
01:17:00,552 --> 01:17:04,522
(Andong Lake's bright sun glitter unfolds before their eyes.)

2219
01:17:04,852 --> 01:17:07,121
The blue lake we just saw.

2220
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:09,131
You can walk across Andong Lake...

2221
01:17:09,132 --> 01:17:11,332
and enjoy the scenery viewed by past scholars.

2222
01:17:11,532 --> 01:17:13,861
This place has the Sunseong Waterway as well.

2223
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:16,302
Let us enjoy the vibes of past scholars.

2224
01:17:17,672 --> 01:17:18,731
It's going to be exciting.

2225
01:17:18,732 --> 01:17:21,302
(At the entrance of the waterway...)

2226
01:17:21,602 --> 01:17:24,842
Gosh, this is the perfect place for a nobleman.

2227
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:26,382
It sure is.

2228
01:17:26,582 --> 01:17:28,712
Gosh, it feels so refreshing.

2229
01:17:29,012 --> 01:17:31,881
That is how the scenery of nature feels here.

2230
01:17:31,882 --> 01:17:34,098
(A spectacular view of Andong Lake unfolds at the end of the steps.)

2231
01:17:34,122 --> 01:17:36,052
Hooray!

2232
01:17:36,192 --> 01:17:37,752
It's wonderful here!

2233
01:17:38,722 --> 01:17:40,892
- Hooray! Go and run.
- Hooray!

2234
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:42,222
- Hooray!
- Get some exercise.

2235
01:17:42,662 --> 01:17:45,592
(I must run if asked to.)

2236
01:17:45,692 --> 01:17:47,232
Gosh, it's nice here.

2237
01:17:47,932 --> 01:17:50,332
Those farmhands are having fun together.

2238
01:17:51,472 --> 01:17:52,872
How far out are we going?

2239
01:17:53,472 --> 01:17:54,841
This is the end.

2240
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:56,171
Gosh, it's beautiful here.

2241
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:57,918
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- It's truly beautiful.

2242
01:17:57,942 --> 01:17:59,641
Why did you come separately? Do you not like each other?

2243
01:17:59,642 --> 01:18:01,111
We came out first.

2244
01:18:01,112 --> 01:18:03,472
- I hate the very sight of them.
- We checked if it's safe.

2245
01:18:03,552 --> 01:18:05,511
We were asked to check while taking each step.

2246
01:18:05,512 --> 01:18:07,181
Sebastian! Was it okay?

2247
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,022
- Everything is safe, sir.
- Right.

2248
01:18:09,522 --> 01:18:11,552
We must live for you to live.

2249
01:18:11,652 --> 01:18:13,021
- I am well aware of that, sir.
- All right.

2250
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,391
Us noblemen will play rock-paper-scissors.

2251
01:18:14,392 --> 01:18:17,531
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. Rock-paper-scissors.

2252
01:18:17,532 --> 01:18:19,192
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

2253
01:18:19,302 --> 01:18:21,132
Go in for a dip, Lovely.

2254
01:18:22,162 --> 01:18:24,472
- It's you!
- I lost.

2255
01:18:24,672 --> 01:18:26,101
- Check the water temperature!
- Right.

2256
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:27,372
Check how deep it is as well.

2257
01:18:28,002 --> 01:18:29,242
Let's go, Lovely.

2258
01:18:29,672 --> 01:18:31,872
Hey, I went straight in back in my time.

2259
01:18:32,642 --> 01:18:33,711
(Approaching)

2260
01:18:33,712 --> 01:18:34,742
Come here, Sebastian.

2261
01:18:35,982 --> 01:18:37,282
There you go.

2262
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:38,452
- Everyone.
- Yes?

2263
01:18:38,612 --> 01:18:40,721
There's the saying, "What goes up comes down."

2264
01:18:40,722 --> 01:18:42,422
- Right.
- Right.

2265
01:18:42,522 --> 01:18:44,022
- Life is a mystery.
- Right.

2266
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:47,461
As the farmhands have suffered a lot for half the day...

2267
01:18:47,462 --> 01:18:48,462
Right.

2268
01:18:49,162 --> 01:18:51,962
(Has that time come?)

2269
01:18:52,092 --> 01:18:54,531
This is the chance for a complete turnaround.

2270
01:18:54,532 --> 01:18:55,832
- Gosh.
- Sure.

2271
01:18:56,472 --> 01:18:58,872
If you fail to take your chance, things will get even worse.

2272
01:19:00,342 --> 01:19:02,242
- Gosh.
- You dare aim for freedom?

2273
01:19:02,372 --> 01:19:03,472
(Laughing)

2274
01:19:04,742 --> 01:19:06,481
- Give up now instead.
- Right.

2275
01:19:06,482 --> 01:19:07,758
We'll keep things at this level then.

2276
01:19:07,782 --> 01:19:09,552
If I manage to turn things around,

2277
01:19:09,982 --> 01:19:11,482
I'll make you shed tears.

2278
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:15,351
(The start of a tragedy)

2279
01:19:15,352 --> 01:19:17,191
A chance to turn things around for the status...

2280
01:19:17,192 --> 01:19:19,221
of the noblemen and farmhands is on the line with this mission.

2281
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:22,521
It's Life Turnaround Biseokchigi.

2282
01:19:22,522 --> 01:19:24,062
- Biseokchigi!
- Gosh.

2283
01:19:24,232 --> 01:19:25,331
I'm good at this.

2284
01:19:25,332 --> 01:19:28,762
It's a 1-on-1 battle between the noblemen and the farmhands.

2285
01:19:28,832 --> 01:19:31,031
There are starting lines on both ends.

2286
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,471
- Starting from each starting line, - I got it.

2287
01:19:32,472 --> 01:19:35,541
The players must keep the stones in their bottoms...

2288
01:19:35,542 --> 01:19:39,482
and run to hit the stone in the center first.

2289
01:19:39,842 --> 01:19:42,212
Come on! Se Yoon's bottom is like tongs.

2290
01:19:42,542 --> 01:19:44,311
- It goes between the cheeks?
- Yes.

2291
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:45,412
(Big Bottom)

2292
01:19:45,582 --> 01:19:48,051
Let's start with the one who wants to turn things around the most.

2293
01:19:48,052 --> 01:19:49,282
I'll go first.

2294
01:19:51,092 --> 01:19:52,352
I'll go first.

2295
01:19:54,192 --> 01:19:55,492
- Great.
- You rascal.

2296
01:19:55,562 --> 01:19:56,831
- How dare you!
- "You rascal."

2297
01:19:56,832 --> 01:19:58,491
If I continue to be the nobleman,

2298
01:19:58,492 --> 01:19:59,731
you're whole face will be painted black.

2299
01:19:59,732 --> 01:20:02,101
- If you...
- Wait and see.

2300
01:20:02,102 --> 01:20:03,971
- I'll teach you a lesson.
- manage to change your status,

2301
01:20:03,972 --> 01:20:05,772
- what will you name him?
- Him?

2302
01:20:06,642 --> 01:20:07,802
Hey, Piggy!

2303
01:20:09,742 --> 01:20:10,871
(You dare awaken the sleeping Piggy?)

2304
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:13,012
- "Piggy!"
- You're up for some trouble.

2305
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,941
- "Piggy!"
- Gosh!

2306
01:20:14,942 --> 01:20:16,681
- I like Piggy.
- "Piggy."

2307
01:20:16,682 --> 01:20:19,581
- "Eat up, Piggy."
- I like that one.

2308
01:20:19,582 --> 01:20:20,752
Let us begin.

2309
01:20:21,182 --> 01:20:25,052
(Nobleman Se Yoon versus Farmhand Hooray)

2310
01:20:25,422 --> 01:20:26,621
Let's give it a try.

2311
01:20:26,622 --> 01:20:28,022
(Things are being set up.)

2312
01:20:28,162 --> 01:20:29,162
(Placing the stone between the cheeks)

2313
01:20:29,163 --> 01:20:31,262
- I'm going to win.
- You have to beat him.

2314
01:20:32,392 --> 01:20:34,002
- Hey!
- What?

2315
01:20:34,732 --> 01:20:37,432
(Walking like a cat)

2316
01:20:37,702 --> 01:20:39,032
- Hey!
- What?

2317
01:20:39,902 --> 01:20:41,442
Didn't he plant it on his bottom?

2318
01:20:42,772 --> 01:20:44,341
Gosh, he's celebrating at this point.

2319
01:20:44,342 --> 01:20:45,672
You should back out now, Seon Ho.

2320
01:20:46,012 --> 01:20:47,911
If it's too hard, pull down your pants.

2321
01:20:47,912 --> 01:20:49,058
(I shouldn't have messed with him.)

2322
01:20:49,082 --> 01:20:51,411
(Both players head to their positions.)

2323
01:20:51,412 --> 01:20:52,782
Let's go, noblemen!

2324
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:56,092
Gosh, I have a bad feeling. It keeps falling.

2325
01:20:56,752 --> 01:20:57,891
(He tries his best to stick it in between.)

2326
01:20:57,892 --> 01:20:59,412
I should shove it in as much as I can.

2327
01:20:59,762 --> 01:21:01,762
It won't work. It keeps falling.

2328
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:04,231
Gosh, I finally digested my food.

2329
01:21:04,232 --> 01:21:05,832
(Relaxed)

2330
01:21:05,962 --> 01:21:09,532
If you drop it, you have to start over.

2331
01:21:10,402 --> 01:21:13,102
(Charisma of Big Bottom)

2332
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:15,772
It's about to fall! I have to hurry!

2333
01:21:16,512 --> 01:21:17,711
It's already inside.

2334
01:21:17,712 --> 01:21:19,072
Can the legs be crossed like that?

2335
01:21:19,612 --> 01:21:20,782
That should be done.

2336
01:21:20,982 --> 01:21:22,751
All right. Here we go.

2337
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,712
Seon Ho has the speed.

2338
01:21:24,952 --> 01:21:27,451
Se Yoon has it fully planted.

2339
01:21:27,452 --> 01:21:28,452
All right.

2340
01:21:28,722 --> 01:21:30,992
I'm not sure who will win.

2341
01:21:31,722 --> 01:21:33,722
Here we go! Get ready!

2342
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:36,592
- Start!
- Let's go!

2343
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:37,792
Start!

2344
01:21:37,793 --> 01:21:39,662
(Leaping forward)

2345
01:21:39,862 --> 01:21:42,432
(He keeps it secure with his cute bottom.)

2346
01:21:42,662 --> 01:21:45,902
(Seon Ho is unexpectedly fast.)

2347
01:21:47,342 --> 01:21:49,942
(His lips are closed tightly.)

2348
01:21:50,012 --> 01:21:51,012
Gosh!

2349
01:21:51,013 --> 01:21:52,312
(What about Se Yoon?)

2350
01:21:52,442 --> 01:21:54,612
Gosh, he's so fast. That doesn't make sense.

2351
01:21:54,842 --> 01:21:55,842
Start!

2352
01:21:55,843 --> 01:21:57,682
(Is he sprinting?)

2353
01:21:58,012 --> 01:22:02,082
(The stone is secured tightly without a budge.)

2354
01:22:02,682 --> 01:22:05,052
(Overwhelming talent)

2355
01:22:05,122 --> 01:22:07,822
(Unwavering comfort)

2356
01:22:08,022 --> 01:22:10,632
(Who will be the one to arrive first?)

2357
01:22:10,862 --> 01:22:12,091
He's unrivaled.

2358
01:22:12,092 --> 01:22:13,102
(Se Yoon arrives.)

2359
01:22:13,332 --> 01:22:15,832
(However, he has to go back if he fails.)

2360
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:18,132
(Seon Ho came slightly late.)

2361
01:22:18,932 --> 01:22:21,972
(Tossing)

2362
01:22:22,372 --> 01:22:25,772
(Did someone's stone make it?)

2363
01:22:26,182 --> 01:22:29,341
(Did Seon Ho make a big comeback?)

2364
01:22:29,342 --> 01:22:30,382
It was me, wasn't it?

2365
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,552
What?

2366
01:22:35,082 --> 01:22:37,752
(Se Yoon makes it.)

2367
01:22:37,992 --> 01:22:39,521
- Se Yoon wins.
- It's him.

2368
01:22:39,522 --> 01:22:42,722
(Se Yoon keeps his status as nobleman.)

2369
01:22:43,462 --> 01:22:44,491
But...

2370
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:46,862
(Plopping down)

2371
01:22:47,202 --> 01:22:50,302
(His legs give in on the spot.)

2372
01:22:50,602 --> 01:22:53,402
Get up. How can you beat me?

2373
01:22:53,972 --> 01:22:55,172
Get up, you punk.

2374
01:22:55,542 --> 01:22:56,872
How adorable.

2375
01:22:57,112 --> 01:22:58,912
It's okay. What should you say?

2376
01:22:59,112 --> 01:23:01,441
What else would I do, sir?

2377
01:23:01,442 --> 01:23:03,028
- You must've really wanted to win.
- No!

2378
01:23:03,052 --> 01:23:04,652
Okay. Come over here for now.

2379
01:23:04,712 --> 01:23:06,822
- All right.
- Come here.

2380
01:23:07,352 --> 01:23:10,122
- Se Yoon stays as nobleman.
- What did you say?

2381
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:11,921
- Keep massaging me.
- My nobleman.

2382
01:23:11,922 --> 01:23:13,938
- I will serve you.
- Let's move on to the next group.

2383
01:23:13,962 --> 01:23:15,261
- I kept my status.
- Let's go!

2384
01:23:15,262 --> 01:23:17,191
- Congratulations.
- I kept my status.

2385
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:18,608
- Congratulations.
- Are they up next?

2386
01:23:18,632 --> 01:23:20,102
Gosh, how is this done?

2387
01:23:21,132 --> 01:23:22,831
The cheeks have to grab onto it.

2388
01:23:22,832 --> 01:23:24,632
Right in between.

2389
01:23:24,972 --> 01:23:26,642
(Sniffling)

2390
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:30,312
Go! Did I get it?

2391
01:23:30,412 --> 01:23:32,812
(Looking mad)

2392
01:23:33,042 --> 01:23:36,282
Nobleman DinDin versus Farmhand Lovely.

2393
01:23:36,352 --> 01:23:37,581
Let's go, noblemen!

2394
01:23:37,582 --> 01:23:40,382
- Sit here.
- Yes, Master.

2395
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:41,752
Ready.

2396
01:23:42,322 --> 01:23:43,591
I'm so nervous.

2397
01:23:43,592 --> 01:23:45,252
Will their status change?

2398
01:23:45,522 --> 01:23:46,962
Ready.

2399
01:23:47,792 --> 01:23:48,821
Start!

2400
01:23:48,822 --> 01:23:50,392
(DinDin, Lee Joon)

2401
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:54,502
(Lee Joon runs with his legs crossed like Seon Ho.)

2402
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:55,901
Lee Joon is fast!

2403
01:23:55,902 --> 01:23:57,032
(Loping)

2404
01:23:57,172 --> 01:23:59,402
(Meanwhile, DinDin...)

2405
01:23:59,472 --> 01:24:02,102
(Flinching)

2406
01:24:02,372 --> 01:24:04,812
(The stone is about to fall.)

2407
01:24:05,542 --> 01:24:08,312
(He looks more like a sly subject than a nobleman.)

2408
01:24:08,642 --> 01:24:11,152
(A definite difference in speed)

2409
01:24:11,312 --> 01:24:12,481
He's fast.

2410
01:24:12,482 --> 01:24:13,822
Lee Joon is fast!

2411
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,452
(Super serious)

2412
01:24:16,652 --> 01:24:18,822
(Is Lee Joon rising in status like this?)

2413
01:24:19,152 --> 01:24:20,438
- It will change!
- They will switch!

2414
01:24:20,462 --> 01:24:23,132
- What?
- You kicked it. Do it again.

2415
01:24:24,062 --> 01:24:26,502
(He touched the stone with his foot.)

2416
01:24:29,102 --> 01:24:31,302
- No, I didn't.
- Do it again.

2417
01:24:31,732 --> 01:24:32,942
No!

2418
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:35,802
(In the meantime, DinDin is approaching.)

2419
01:24:36,042 --> 01:24:38,712
(At this rate, DinDin can maintain his noble status.)

2420
01:24:38,942 --> 01:24:40,111
He kicked it.

2421
01:24:40,112 --> 01:24:42,142
He kicked it with his foot.

2422
01:24:43,882 --> 01:24:46,382
(DinDin also dropped it.)

2423
01:24:46,652 --> 01:24:48,251
(They both go back to the starting point.)

2424
01:24:48,252 --> 01:24:49,422
No!

2425
01:24:49,892 --> 01:24:51,251
(DinDin starts first, with the stone between his legs.)

2426
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:52,352
He kicked it.

2427
01:24:54,392 --> 01:24:56,892
(The sly subject is back.)

2428
01:24:57,232 --> 01:25:00,462
(Lee Joon starts a little later than DinDin.)

2429
01:25:00,802 --> 01:25:02,501
What? It looks like he doesn't have anything.

2430
01:25:02,502 --> 01:25:03,932
(Striding)

2431
01:25:03,972 --> 01:25:07,072
(Ironclad buttocks)

2432
01:25:07,242 --> 01:25:10,042
DinDin is so slow. He's too slow.

2433
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,311
(Toddling)

2434
01:25:11,312 --> 01:25:13,058
I guess he doesn't have fat on his buttocks.

2435
01:25:13,082 --> 01:25:15,182
He's here. Do it again. You can take it easy.

2436
01:25:16,212 --> 01:25:18,482
(In trouble)

2437
01:25:18,812 --> 01:25:21,322
(DinDin goes back to the starting point again.)

2438
01:25:21,482 --> 01:25:24,222
(In the meantime, Lee Joon comes forward.)

2439
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:26,962
(Abdominal respiration)

2440
01:25:27,062 --> 01:25:29,291
He's here. Do it again. You can take it easy.

2441
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:31,162
(If Lee Joon knocks the stone over, he wins.)

2442
01:25:31,632 --> 01:25:33,762
He's here. Do it again. You can take it easy.

2443
01:25:34,102 --> 01:25:38,872
(It fell over.)

2444
01:25:39,432 --> 01:25:42,702
(Lee Joon successfully escapes being the farmhand.)

2445
01:25:43,312 --> 01:25:44,712
Come over here, you brat.

2446
01:25:45,612 --> 01:25:48,412
(Me?)

2447
01:25:48,912 --> 01:25:50,211
(He takes off the farmhand costume right away.)

2448
01:25:50,212 --> 01:25:52,212
You farmhand.

2449
01:25:53,282 --> 01:25:55,782
(Giving off the cool vibe)

2450
01:25:56,322 --> 01:25:58,992
(The new nobleman is here.)

2451
01:25:59,252 --> 01:26:00,462
(Laughing)

2452
01:26:01,792 --> 01:26:02,962
Put it on me.

2453
01:26:03,762 --> 01:26:05,061
It's cold.

2454
01:26:05,062 --> 01:26:06,661
(The nobleman is feeling cold.)

2455
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:08,632
You can't do that. Put my arms first.

2456
01:26:08,662 --> 01:26:10,001
- Yes, sir.
- Do it again.

2457
01:26:10,002 --> 01:26:12,432
The robe has found the right person. He looks good on it.

2458
01:26:12,532 --> 01:26:14,001
This makes more sense when we see his face.

2459
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:15,878
(The silk robe has finally found the right owner.)

2460
01:26:15,902 --> 01:26:17,671
It looks good on you.

2461
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:18,672
- Joon is...
- You brat.

2462
01:26:18,672 --> 01:26:19,672
I saw this coming when you were acting up.

2463
01:26:19,673 --> 01:26:20,742
Be quiet, you punk.

2464
01:26:21,642 --> 01:26:23,481
(How dare you interrupt the noblemen's talk?)

2465
01:26:23,482 --> 01:26:24,852
- Massage my leg.
- Good.

2466
01:26:24,912 --> 01:26:25,951
His leg is as thick as a person's waist.

2467
01:26:25,952 --> 01:26:26,982
Next.

2468
01:26:27,622 --> 01:26:29,652
I really want to win.

2469
01:26:29,822 --> 01:26:31,652
- I really want to win.
- Sebastian.

2470
01:26:32,422 --> 01:26:34,492
No.

2471
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:37,231
(He got beaten up.)

2472
01:26:37,232 --> 01:26:39,662
(He rolled on the ground.)

2473
01:26:39,802 --> 01:26:41,762
(You can see it once every two times I see it.)

2474
01:26:41,832 --> 01:26:44,072
(Sad)

2475
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:47,472
(A chance to escape from the corrupt nobleman)

2476
01:26:47,672 --> 01:26:50,972
Will it be Lord Kim or Lord Cho?

2477
01:26:51,342 --> 01:26:54,512
Hang on. How should I put it between my legs?

2478
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:56,952
How about this? Like this.

2479
01:26:58,082 --> 01:26:59,682
You have to start over if you drop it.

2480
01:27:00,622 --> 01:27:01,821
It looks like your abs.

2481
01:27:01,822 --> 01:27:03,092
(He's just bright.)

2482
01:27:03,452 --> 01:27:05,892
The last match. Are you ready?

2483
01:27:06,022 --> 01:27:08,892
You brat! You farmhand!

2484
01:27:09,022 --> 01:27:10,492
How dare you covet my status?

2485
01:27:11,032 --> 01:27:12,461
- Ready.
- You...

2486
01:27:12,462 --> 01:27:13,732
(Intrigued)

2487
01:27:15,432 --> 01:27:16,472
Start.

2488
01:27:18,372 --> 01:27:20,472
(Moving)

2489
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:23,142
(Moving at full speed)

2490
01:27:23,172 --> 01:27:25,442
(A gait that doesn't suit a nobleman)

2491
01:27:25,612 --> 01:27:27,742
(Meanwhile, Sae Ho is...)

2492
01:27:28,012 --> 01:27:30,412
(Desperate)

2493
01:27:30,652 --> 01:27:34,252
(Speeding up with short steps)

2494
01:27:35,322 --> 01:27:37,952
They're coming at a similar speed.

2495
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:40,822
(Neck and neck)

2496
01:27:41,392 --> 01:27:42,622
Darn it!

2497
01:27:43,192 --> 01:27:44,531
(Jong Min drops it.)

2498
01:27:44,532 --> 01:27:46,631
No!

2499
01:27:46,632 --> 01:27:48,338
(Jong Min goes back to the starting point.)

2500
01:27:48,362 --> 01:27:49,678
(In the meantime, Sae Ho approaches the midpoint.)

2501
01:27:49,702 --> 01:27:51,631
He dropped it.

2502
01:27:51,632 --> 01:27:53,352
(A golden opportunity to switch the status)

2503
01:27:53,472 --> 01:27:56,102
(Once he knocks the stone over, he finally rises in status.)

2504
01:27:56,142 --> 01:27:58,312
(Desperate)

2505
01:27:58,412 --> 01:28:00,082
Will they switch?

2506
01:28:00,382 --> 01:28:02,212
No!

2507
01:28:03,042 --> 01:28:04,351
Will they switch?

2508
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:06,252
(Their statuses are about to be switched.)

2509
01:28:07,822 --> 01:28:09,352
Will they switch?

2510
01:28:13,522 --> 01:28:17,692
(Sae Ho successfully escapes from being a farmhand.)

2511
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:19,192
No!

2512
01:28:19,432 --> 01:28:21,662
(Demoted to a farmhand)

2513
01:28:22,002 --> 01:28:25,502
(Goodbye to those sad days)

2514
01:28:25,672 --> 01:28:27,772
Lord Cho wins!

2515
01:28:28,372 --> 01:28:30,772
- Good job.
- You went through a lot.

2516
01:28:31,772 --> 01:28:33,642
Go ahead and do it.

2517
01:28:33,782 --> 01:28:34,882
(Laughing)

2518
01:28:36,782 --> 01:28:40,022
(The new nobleman's scary laughter)

2519
01:28:40,382 --> 01:28:43,222
(A new tragedy begins.)

2520
01:28:43,492 --> 01:28:45,652
(Rummaging)

2521
01:28:45,752 --> 01:28:48,761
How does it feel to change the status?

2522
01:28:48,762 --> 01:28:50,061
(A hearty laugh)

2523
01:28:50,062 --> 01:28:52,631
- Lord Cho.
- Nice to meet you.

2524
01:28:52,632 --> 01:28:53,901
He looks so happy.

2525
01:28:53,902 --> 01:28:55,802
The weather is really nice.

2526
01:28:56,402 --> 01:28:57,932
Put this on, you punk.

2527
01:28:58,072 --> 01:28:59,271
Thank you.

2528
01:28:59,272 --> 01:29:01,402
- He looks sad already.
- Get changed.

2529
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:03,071
It's okay. I'll be nice.

2530
01:29:03,072 --> 01:29:04,512
Okay. For me...

2531
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:06,311
The name of my farmhand is Love.

2532
01:29:06,312 --> 01:29:07,342
- Love?
- Yes.

2533
01:29:07,482 --> 01:29:09,511
I was nice to him.

2534
01:29:09,512 --> 01:29:11,611
- He was nice.
- I was nice to him.

2535
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:13,482
(Evolved into a pet dog)

2536
01:29:13,752 --> 01:29:15,152
Do we have hope?

2537
01:29:15,422 --> 01:29:16,452
Of course.

2538
01:29:16,482 --> 01:29:17,622
Do you have wet wipes?

2539
01:29:17,922 --> 01:29:18,922
Wet wipes?

2540
01:29:19,092 --> 01:29:20,792
Just hold out for four hours.

2541
01:29:21,562 --> 01:29:23,962
Gosh, Sae Ho. You look cool now.

2542
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:25,561
You look strong.

2543
01:29:25,562 --> 01:29:26,862
(A potential general)

2544
01:29:27,002 --> 01:29:29,332
I'll think about it again. We will do it again later.

2545
01:29:29,402 --> 01:29:31,171
You look cool with the beard.

2546
01:29:31,172 --> 01:29:32,372
- Yes. Have a seat.
- Well...

2547
01:29:32,532 --> 01:29:34,972
My Airhead. Have a seat.

2548
01:29:35,572 --> 01:29:37,112
Airhead.

2549
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:40,812
My dear... Airhead, how old are you?

2550
01:29:40,882 --> 01:29:41,982
I'm 46.

2551
01:29:42,042 --> 01:29:43,482
Oh, dear. Airhead.

2552
01:29:43,812 --> 01:29:45,152
Turn around, Airhead.

2553
01:29:45,382 --> 01:29:47,221
We will show them later.

2554
01:29:47,222 --> 01:29:48,521
(You reap what you sow.)

2555
01:29:48,522 --> 01:29:49,852
My Airhead.

2556
01:29:50,522 --> 01:29:53,262
(After a while)

2557
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:55,422
Airhead has poor eyesight.

2558
01:29:56,262 --> 01:29:57,632
He looks cute.

2559
01:29:58,092 --> 01:29:59,792
He's cute. This is okay.

2560
01:30:00,002 --> 01:30:01,902
He's a little slow, but he's pure.

2561
01:30:02,062 --> 01:30:05,202
- He's our Airhead.
- So, he's Airhead.

2562
01:30:05,602 --> 01:30:07,801
- Oh, dear.
- Airhead, you should...

2563
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:11,341
giggle like this when I call you Airhead.

2564
01:30:11,342 --> 01:30:12,672
Airhead.

2565
01:30:13,382 --> 01:30:14,481
My Airhead.

2566
01:30:14,482 --> 01:30:15,511
(Perfect)

2567
01:30:15,512 --> 01:30:16,952
Airhead.

2568
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:20,382
(Airhead pays off his karma.)

2569
01:30:20,682 --> 01:30:22,882
Nice to meet you. Let's get along.

2570
01:30:23,322 --> 01:30:25,291
I'll change your name to Choreng.

2571
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:26,891
- Choreng? Okay.
- Choreng. It sounds cute.

2572
01:30:26,892 --> 01:30:28,221
- When I call you Choreng, - Choreng.

2573
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:30,291
- say, "Yes, sir."
- Yes, sir.

2574
01:30:30,292 --> 01:30:31,962
- All right. That's it.
- Everyone.

2575
01:30:32,092 --> 01:30:34,401
- We will head to the base camp now.
- No!

2576
01:30:34,402 --> 01:30:35,432
- The base camp?
- Why?

2577
01:30:35,632 --> 01:30:37,913
I bet there will be a lot of work to do at the base camp.

2578
01:30:38,002 --> 01:30:39,331
Let's go to the palace.

2579
01:30:39,332 --> 01:30:41,241
The farmhands will have to work.

2580
01:30:41,242 --> 01:30:42,842
(A warning about the farmhands' work)

2581
01:30:43,872 --> 01:30:45,312
Airhead.

2582
01:30:46,012 --> 01:30:47,541
- Lead the way.
- Yes, sir.

2583
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:49,222
(You should lead the way on our way back.)

2584
01:30:49,512 --> 01:30:52,881
I must say it depends on which nobleman you serve.

2585
01:30:52,882 --> 01:30:54,028
(What awaits the new farmhands?)

2586
01:30:54,052 --> 01:30:55,882
(Next episode)

2587
01:30:56,322 --> 01:30:58,952
(The only sun under the sky)

2588
01:30:59,352 --> 01:31:01,592
(Among them, a king will be born.)

2589
01:31:02,022 --> 01:31:05,432
(A chance to rule the world)

2590
01:31:05,692 --> 01:31:08,032
(Maximum ambition)

2591
01:31:08,602 --> 01:31:10,872
(And so begins the battle for the throne.)

2592
01:31:11,272 --> 01:31:13,201
(I will throw myself...)

2593
01:31:13,202 --> 01:31:14,872
(into becoming the king.)

2594
01:31:15,202 --> 01:31:17,172
(Those who cannot back down...)

2595
01:31:17,512 --> 01:31:19,942
