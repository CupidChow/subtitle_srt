1
00:00:00,797 --> 00:00:02,967
(They suddenly want us to call our friends?)

2
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:06,377
(Friend, let's hang out at KBS.)

3
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:09,406
(I'll make you a star.)

4
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:12,847
(The friends they were waiting for show up.)

5
00:00:13,877 --> 00:00:15,917
(Joon's friend, Actor Kang Han Na)

6
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,846
(An unexpected connection, Dex)

7
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:18,847
Dex?

8
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:19,887
(Surprised)

9
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,956
(World star, (G)I-DLE's SHUHUA)

10
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,126
(We'll spend a night with them at KBS.)

11
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,597
(It's not fun without some dancing.)

12
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:33,267
(A real "Queencard")

13
00:00:33,437 --> 00:00:34,597
This is Dex!

14
00:00:35,937 --> 00:00:38,837
(I want this man.)

15
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:40,877
(Changing the atmosphere)

16
00:00:41,137 --> 00:00:44,447
(Can they keep things on a high?)

17
00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:49,016
(2 Days 1 Night)

18
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:51,046
- Thanks so much.
- I know.

19
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:52,956
- For today's Dinner Game, - What is it?

20
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:55,056
We'll split you into two teams.

21
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:56,057
- Okay.
- Two teams.

22
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:57,156
- You're free...
- We must divide in half.

23
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,226
To divide yourselves up.

24
00:00:58,227 --> 00:00:59,456
- Just as we stand?
- Like this?

25
00:00:59,457 --> 00:01:00,457
- This is one team?
- As we stand.

26
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,526
One team, another team?

27
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:03,196
- This is fate. How's that?
- This is fate?

28
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,266
If you think about us, we have Dex,

29
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:06,667
- so we fear nothing.
- Right.

30
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:08,496
We have Joon.

31
00:01:08,497 --> 00:01:09,966
- Well...
- They have Dex,

32
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:11,966
and we have Joon, so it's okay.

33
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:13,476
- He has bigger muscles.
- The physical members.

34
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:14,937
Dex's opponent is Woo Il.

35
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:17,047
- Dex...
- He's a stallion.

36
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:19,716
The old-fashioned hairstyle. The stallion cut.

37
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:21,847
Dex is here.

38
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:24,417
(A preemptive attack)

39
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,087
Wasn't that mockery?

40
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:27,586
Well done.

41
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,286
- Wasn't that mockery?
- Show him!

42
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:30,927
Woo Il's here.

43
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,657
Dex is here.

44
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:36,027
Dex is here.

45
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:37,996
You scrunch up your face to say that.

46
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,697
You're handsome even when you do it.

47
00:01:39,797 --> 00:01:41,066
- That's a shame.
- Yes.

48
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,067
It's a pity.

49
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,407
Do we have our two teams?

50
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,057
- We're okay with that.
- Sounds good.

51
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:46,706
- Okay.
- Then, first of all,

52
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,006
can each team create a chant?

53
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,087
We'll ask you to chant it and then start right away.

54
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:52,206
- Me and Kang Han Na.
- Me and...

55
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:53,576
(They're creating a team name around Han Na's name.)

56
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:54,717
We're here.

57
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:56,146
Kang Han Na's here...

58
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:57,216
- with us.
- With us.

59
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,516
We're here with Kang Han Na.

60
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:00,116
- Kang Han Na's here with us.
- Kang Han Na's here...

61
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:01,616
- with us.
- With us. Okay.

62
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:02,726
And we close with this.

63
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:03,857
- Okay.
- That dance.

64
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:05,857
They're taking too long.

65
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:08,727
- There's a lot in it.
- You're doing this too?

66
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,567
Shall we go first and do this first?

67
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,766
- Us?
- Let's do it first.

68
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:14,567
Hey, let's do this and do this first.

69
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:16,206
We'll go first.

70
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:17,606
Let's take a few steps back.

71
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:19,036
- Okay.
- It's "SHUHUA-I-DLE."

72
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:20,436
Se Yoon's team will go first.

73
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:21,506
- Go ahead.
- We're ready.

74
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:22,507
We are...

75
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,246
- SHUHUA-I-DLE.
- SHUHUA-I-DLE.

76
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:25,976
(They do Han Na's dance.)

77
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:27,376
(How could you?)

78
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:28,476
- SHUHUA-I-DLE.
- SHUHUA-I-DLE.

79
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:30,146
- We're here!
- We're here!

80
00:02:30,147 --> 00:02:31,216
(Come on.)

81
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,716
What are you doing? They copied us!

82
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:34,186
- How could you?
- What was that?

83
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,316
- What was that?
- It's up to us.

84
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:36,886
We were doing just that over here.

85
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:37,986
- Yes.
- So what?

86
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:39,496
Let's show them the original!

87
00:02:39,497 --> 00:02:40,696
- Yes.
- The original.

88
00:02:40,697 --> 00:02:41,756
- Ready, go!
- Go.

89
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:42,796
- Kang Han...
- Kang Han...

90
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:43,797
Na's...

91
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,627
- here with us!
- Here with us!

92
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:47,597
We're the originals.

93
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,837
What's that?

94
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,407
- That ruined the mood.
- How dare they say that?

95
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:52,737
That ruined the mood.

96
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,377
I know.

97
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,147
Is that allowed?

98
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:57,476
- You can't copy us.
- Right.

99
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,807
Why did you copy us?

100
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:00,016
Okay, then.

101
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:02,886
We'll start the Dinner Game.

102
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:04,317
- Okay.
- Okay.

103
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,456
- Okay.
- It's the perfect time for dinner.

104
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:08,356
Especially for today's dinner,

105
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:10,957
we'll let our members and their friends decide...

106
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:14,227
what they want to eat and order it to be delivered.

107
00:03:14,357 --> 00:03:15,726
There's a lot to choose from.

108
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:18,096
- There are many good places, right?
- Yes, there are.

109
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:21,667
Decide what foods you'll have delivered.

110
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:23,506
- What shall we eat?
- Let's decide.

111
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:24,966
What can we order in Yeouido?

112
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:26,207
- Pasta.
- Pasta?

113
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:27,477
Braised kimchi.

114
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:29,306
- Braised kimchi.
- Braised kimchi.

115
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:30,576
Braised kimchi with pork.

116
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,746
How about bossam and jokbal?

117
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:32,946
- Bossam and jokbal?
- Good, right?

118
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,416
- A bossam, jokbal set...
- Yes.

119
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:35,417
And makguksu.

120
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:36,516
- Kimchi stew.
- Galbitang?

121
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,987
- No, not kimchi stew.
- Galbitang?

122
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:39,616
- Let him speak.
- No.

123
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:40,756
It's just that...

124
00:03:40,757 --> 00:03:42,616
You asked me and then said no.

125
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:44,386
Whatever I say, you say no.

126
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:45,626
You keep saying no.

127
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:47,456
- I can't say a thing.
- What do you like?

128
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:48,996
(The delivery app is working hard to feed the workers.)

129
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:49,997
(Preparing the food)

130
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:52,626
We'll begin the Dinner Game.

131
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:53,666
- Okay.
- Yes!

132
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,866
(This is exciting.)

133
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,737
Depending on the results,

134
00:03:57,207 --> 00:04:00,907
the winning team will get all the food.

135
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,806
- What they ordered too?
- That's harsh.

136
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:04,577
- The other team's food too?
- Yes.

137
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:06,476
My decaf iced Americano...

138
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:07,676
- will go to them?
- We want it all.

139
00:04:07,677 --> 00:04:08,776
- Yes.
- Leftovers aren't allowed.

140
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:09,786
Okay, good.

141
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:12,386
Today's dinner game is a team match called...

142
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:14,257
"Quiz Expedition Variety World."

143
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:16,457
It's a quiz?

144
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,927
We have Jong Min!

145
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,057
"Variety World." The history of entertainment.

146
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:24,167
We got this.

147
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:26,026
There's Jong Min.

148
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:27,236
We're a bit weaker.

149
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:28,936
- We're weaker.
- We're weaker.

150
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,837
There are three rounds.

151
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,107
You compete for points in each round.

152
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:35,436
The team with more points wins.

153
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:36,446
- Okay.
- Okay, then.

154
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:37,606
The first round...

155
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:39,477
is about characters and titles.

156
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:41,446
I'm bad at this.

157
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,546
Variety characters and titles.

158
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:44,346
- I'm bad at this. Oh, no.
- Okay.

159
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:47,717
We'll show you a photo of an actor or a group of actors.

160
00:04:48,017 --> 00:04:49,386
- A group?
- Name the title...

161
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:50,456
- they were in.
- Movie titles?

162
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,056
- Right.
- It's about movies.

163
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:53,526
- I watched a lot of movies.
- Choi Min Sik's movies.

164
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,196
- I really watched a lot of movies.
- "Oldboy."

165
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:56,867
- I don't know a lot of dramas.
- Right.

166
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:58,196
You should give us a benefit.

167
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,836
She's from abroad. And he's from Masan.

168
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:00,936
- Right.
- He's from Masan?

169
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:02,136
- He's from Masan.
- I watched a lot of movies.

170
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:03,236
- I...
- Right.

171
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:04,906
- Who's from Masan?
- Aren't you from Masan?

172
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:06,536
- I'm from Suncheon.
- Right. Suncheon. I'm sorry.

173
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:08,206
You don't even know where I'm from.

174
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,353
- They're two different cities.
- He knows nothing about Dex.

175
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,823
Can we give answers to our teammates?

176
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:13,317
- No.
- No, right?

177
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,293
- If they do, it can't count.
- That won't count.

178
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:16,837
- It can't count.
- I won't accept it.

179
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,717
Then SHUHUA will be at a disadvantage.

180
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,163
Can we use sign language to communicate?

181
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,217
Sign language?

182
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:25,217
- It's because she's SHUHUA.
- SHUHUA can use sign language.

183
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:28,156
(Chuckling)

184
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:29,456
(Acting cute)

185
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:30,496
- That's so funny.
- It's for SHUHUA.

186
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,097
- Look at their smiles. Come on.
- My gosh.

187
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,596
We should help her a bit.

188
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:35,896
(The staff will be considerate as her Korean isn't fluent.)

189
00:05:35,897 --> 00:05:37,867
If Team Han Na is okay with that,

190
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,736
only Seon Ho can tell her the answers.

191
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:41,136
- Okay.
- Other people...

192
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:42,176
- can't tell her the answers.
- Seon Ho is good with titles.

193
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:43,646
- Sure.
- I know a lot of dramas.

194
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:45,367
- I'm an actor.
- Seon Ho is great at this.

195
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:47,146
(Seon Ho is a fan of dramas.)

196
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,946
But you don't have to worry.

197
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:50,547
Seon Ho isn't super good or anything.

198
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:51,986
- Right.
- I see.

199
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:53,057
- Okay.
- Let's try it.

200
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,787
- Let's say DinDin gets it right.
- Okay.

201
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:57,763
- Then he'll leave the game.
- He'll leave the game.

202
00:05:57,787 --> 00:05:59,126
- We play until the last one?
- And...

203
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:01,526
- To win, everyone on the team...
- Everyone has to...

204
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,403
- must guess a question correctly.
- That team will get a point.

205
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:04,596
- Okay.
- Okay.

206
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,096
- If you get it right, you leave.
- Okay.

207
00:06:06,097 --> 00:06:07,097
We do it until everyone leaves the game.

208
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:08,097
- Okay.
- Okay?

209
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:10,466
Is there anyone who doesn't understand the rule so far?

210
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:11,536
- We got it.
- We got it.

211
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,666
- Let's play it now.
- We all got it.

212
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,706
I'm sorry, but it seems Woo Il is clueless.

213
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,007
(Frozen)

214
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:19,776
(Woo Il only got bitten.)

215
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:21,217
So if you know the answer,

216
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,086
- you shout out your team's name?
- That's right.

217
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:24,686
- Like this? Okay.
- We have to say Han Na's name.

218
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:25,716
To warm up,

219
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:27,086
- I'll give you a practice question.
- A practice question.

220
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,886
- A practice question.
- A practice question.

221
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,633
- A practice question.
- Okay. Let's practice.

222
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,756
(Come on, Se Yoon. We've got guests.)

223
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:32,786
Give me us a practice question.

224
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:34,196
He's mocking the director.

225
00:06:34,197 --> 00:06:35,197
Let's begin.

226
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:36,726
Everyone is equal on our show.

227
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:37,796
Here it is.

228
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,003
(The practice question for Round 1 of the Dinner Game)

229
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:40,066
- Here.
- SHUHUA.

230
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,067
- Han Na.
- SHUHUA.

231
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,766
- Han Na.
- Three.

232
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,166
- Han Na.
- "Taxi Driver."

233
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,637
- Three, two...
- "Taxi Driver."

234
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:46,906
- Two, one.
- Han Na.

235
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,636
- "Taxi Driver."
- Correct.

236
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:50,407
(SHUHUA gets it right.)

237
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:52,376
- What?
- "Taxi Driver."

238
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:54,217
- "Taxi Driver."
- The two of them...

239
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,047
- That was amazing.
- I see. Like this.

240
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:58,346
But I whispered the title ten times to your ear.

241
00:06:58,347 --> 00:06:59,756
But you answered it pretty slowly.

242
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:01,657
(Listening intently)

243
00:07:01,957 --> 00:07:03,386
Listen to me carefully.

244
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:04,826
(Will they be able to get it right during the real game too?)

245
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:06,126
- Let's begin.
- My gosh.

246
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:07,656
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.

247
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:09,326
- We must do it right away.
- We have to do it right away.

248
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:10,397
Gosh, I'm nervous.

249
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:11,927
- SHUHUA.
- Han Na.

250
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:12,927
- SHUHUA.
- We were faster.

251
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:13,936
- We were faster.
- Three...

252
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:16,766
(Will they answer it correctly like the practice question?)

253
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:17,767
- We were faster.
- Three,

254
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:18,767
- There are so many.
- two,

255
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:19,776
- "Running Man."
- "Running Man."

256
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:20,777
- One. Wrong.
- Movies or dramas.

257
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:21,836
Hold on.

258
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:24,107
- "Running Man" on a KBS show?
- No.

259
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:26,287
I guess you watch "Running Man" when our show airs.

260
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,517
- Well done.
- He's known for that show.

261
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:29,646
- Han Na.
- Han Na.

262
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:30,846
- Han Na.
- Go ahead, Han Na.

263
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:32,347
- Three, two, - "Tazza."

264
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:33,516
- "Tazza."
- one.

265
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:34,616
- She said "Tazza."
- Wrong.

266
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:35,656
- Why?
- Why?

267
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:37,487
- That's not the full title.
- I see.

268
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,056
(It's Team SHUHUA's turn.)

269
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:41,297
- "Entourage."
- "Running Man" on a KBS show?

270
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,466
- Go ahead, SHUHUA.
- SHUHUA.

271
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:44,526
That's not the full title.

272
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:46,637
- SHUHUA.
- The full title?

273
00:07:46,937 --> 00:07:47,967
- "Entourage."
- SHUHUA.

274
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,367
- "Entourage."
- That's right.

275
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:51,966
- That's right.
- That's right.

276
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,276
- That's right.
- Correct.

277
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:54,506
(SHUHUA gets it right.)

278
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,576
- Nice.
- SHUHUA.

279
00:07:55,577 --> 00:07:56,577
- Nice.
- Queencard

280
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:58,146
I think DinDin gave her the answer.

281
00:07:58,147 --> 00:07:59,946
- I saw him give the answer.
- DinDin gave her the answer.

282
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,746
- I saw it.
- No, I didn't.

283
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,027
- Let's check the footage.
- No.

284
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:04,346
- Let's check the footage.
- Hey.

285
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:05,446
- Can you swear then?
- I didn't.

286
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:06,516
- Let's check the footage.
- I didn't.

287
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:07,517
- This is...
- What?

288
00:08:07,518 --> 00:08:08,816
- Is this a bench-clearing brawl?
- My gosh.

289
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:10,156
- Go, Dex.
- Hey.

290
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,627
- Great.
- Let's go.

291
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:13,996
- Dex. Go.
- What? Why are we fighting?

292
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:15,796
- Why are we fighting?
- You have a nice body.

293
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:16,927
- Dex has a nice body.
- Go.

294
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,426
DinDin, can we check all the audio clips...

295
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:19,596
when we edit the footage later?

296
00:08:19,597 --> 00:08:21,297
- It's...
- Ask her then.

297
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:23,606
- You must clarify this. You did it.
- Gosh. You...

298
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,507
- Did I tell you the answer?
- Hold on.

299
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,606
(She's too kind to lie.)

300
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,536
- You did tell her the answer.
- Hey.

301
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:30,606
- You did it.
- Right.

302
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:32,046
- I heard it.
- You know what?

303
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:33,176
Your honesty is more important than the game.

304
00:08:33,177 --> 00:08:35,246
- People of all age groups watch it.
- Right.

305
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:36,616
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

306
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:37,747
- Hey.
- Come on.

307
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:39,616
(I made a mistake when our guests are here.)

308
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:41,256
- Sorry to do this to the guests.
- Right.

309
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:42,257
- He's kind.
- DinDin.

310
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:43,956
- You can do that when it's just us.
- Right.

311
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,086
- He was shocked.
- Let me explain.

312
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:47,296
- Han Na in the back looked at me...
- Right.

313
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:49,326
- with this disapproving look.
- Yes.

314
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,766
- All right.
- I'm sorry about that.

315
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:52,973
- From now on, - "Running Man."

316
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:55,696
- Jae Hyun will only observe DinDin.
- Gosh, Seon Ho.

317
00:08:55,697 --> 00:08:56,866
- Okay.
- Only DinDin.

318
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,883
- He'll only observe DinDin.
- He'll only watch DinDin.

319
00:08:58,907 --> 00:09:00,136
Gosh, that cheating guy.

320
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:01,706
He will only keep an eye on DinDin.

321
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,406
(Covering his mouth with his hands)

322
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:05,006
DinDin, you can't cover your mouth.

323
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:06,547
But I might sneeze.

324
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,717
I'll give you my padded jacket.

325
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:11,317
You can't do ventriloquism.

326
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,356
Let's begin.

327
00:09:13,357 --> 00:09:14,756
(2 Days 1 Night is as intense as the Inferno.)

328
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:16,727
Okay. We still haven't done our first question.

329
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:17,757
- Later.
- Let's begin.

330
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:18,826
- I'll call it out right away.
- We must do it quickly.

331
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:21,157
- One, two...
- One, two, three.

332
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:22,997
- SHUHUA.
- Han Na.

333
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:24,326
- SHUHUA.
- Three,

334
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:25,896
- It's too hard. I don't know.
- two, one.

335
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:26,897
- What is it?
- Out of time.

336
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:28,066
- No.
- This is hard.

337
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,397
Did it not premiere yet?

338
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:31,107
- It did.
- It did?

339
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:32,136
- What is it? It premiered?
- What?

340
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:33,937
- The three of them...
- That's cheating.

341
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:36,177
- Han Na.
- Han Na.

342
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:37,307
"Alienoid."

343
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,976
- He got it right.
- What?

344
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,376
(Did he get it right?)

345
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:41,616
- Here!
- Correct.

346
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:42,776
(Sae Ho gets it right.)

347
00:09:42,777 --> 00:09:44,016
Which one?

348
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,346
- There are two in the series.
- SHUHUA.

349
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:46,446
- SHUHUA.
- But they were in both movies.

350
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:47,763
- So...
- They were in both movies.

351
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,056
(Team Han Na takes the lead.)

352
00:09:49,057 --> 00:09:50,526
- Yes.
- My gosh.

353
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:51,787
- Goodness.
- You're good.

354
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:54,407
Doesn't the Korean title have a plus sign?

355
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,227
The Korean title has a plus sign, doesn't it?

356
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:58,496
- Right.
- No.

357
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,866
- Come on, don't be like that.
- You!

358
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:00,897
You got this.

359
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:02,336
Woo Il, you got this.

360
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:03,967
I liked how you put pressure on them.

361
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,306
We ought to do that. Why?

362
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:06,706
- How honest. It was good.
- What?

363
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,213
- That was detailed.
- Sae Ho, step out.

364
00:10:08,237 --> 00:10:09,947
All right. Let's begin.

365
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,547
Here's the next question.

366
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:13,717
- One, two, three. Ta-da!
- SHUHUA.

367
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,446
- Han Na.
- I know this one.

368
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,116
(He screams out Han Na's name.)

369
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,117
- What is it?
- I know this one.

370
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,486
- Three, two...
- Wait. "1987."

371
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:20,487
- Han Na.
- No.

372
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,487
- That's...
- No.

373
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,057
- Their turn is over.
- The one with...

374
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:24,686
Correct.

375
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:26,126
(Team Han Na gets 2 questions in a row.)

376
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,226
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

377
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,027
- What?
- I was so surprised.

378
00:10:29,197 --> 00:10:30,426
- What?
- What?

379
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:31,767
- What?
- What was that?

380
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:34,167
- What was that?
- My gosh.

381
00:10:34,297 --> 00:10:36,496
- Gang Dong Won got hit...
- Yes.

382
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,236
In the head and died in the movie.

383
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,666
- Right.
- Yoo Hai Jin...

384
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,106
- did this.
- Well done.

385
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,606
This is what he did in the movie.

386
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:44,347
- Nicely done.
- That was amazing.

387
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,546
- Okay.
- Okay.

388
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:47,707
- We got this.
- Nicely done.

389
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,016
- Gosh, that was so fast.
- We can do this.

390
00:10:49,017 --> 00:10:50,116
- Great.
- That was crazy.

391
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,146
- What is it, Sae Ho?
- Let's begin.

392
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:52,547
Let's put our hope in Joon.

393
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:55,763
- I suddenly lost all of my energy.
- Let's begin.

394
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:57,787
- One, two, three.
- He's reliable.

395
00:10:57,887 --> 00:10:58,887
- Ta-da.
- SHUHUA.

396
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:01,197
SHUHUA. Three, two,

397
00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:02,656
one. Out of time.

398
00:11:02,657 --> 00:11:03,726
(They don't know the answer.)

399
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:04,997
- Han Na.
- Han Na.

400
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:06,167
- What?
- "The Heirs."

401
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:08,437
We were sure he'd be the last to go.

402
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:10,167
He got it right. Yes.

403
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:11,666
- That's it.
- Correct.

404
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,606
(They get 3 questions in a row.)

405
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:14,876
- What?
- My gosh.

406
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:16,076
(The dance major will dance to celebrate.)

407
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:17,547
- Nice job.
- My gosh.

408
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:19,177
Well done.

409
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:20,846
- Great.
- My gosh.

410
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,847
(In a trance)

411
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,117
Hey, I got it right.

412
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:26,217
Look at the remaining people. Woo Il is clueless.

413
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:27,956
Woo Il is clueless.

414
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:30,257
- It's okay. We got Woo Il.
- He doesn't know anything.

415
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:32,487
- Okay.
- Great.

416
00:11:32,627 --> 00:11:35,426
By the way, all of our members got the answers first.

417
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:37,227
Only our friends remain.

418
00:11:37,427 --> 00:11:39,127
- Let's begin.
- Here's the next question.

419
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:40,396
- All right. Here it goes.
- Oh, no.

420
00:11:40,397 --> 00:11:42,036
- HANHAE, help us out.
- It's...

421
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:43,366
- Let's go for it.
- I can't seem to remember it.

422
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:44,367
Ta-da.

423
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,866
Lee Young Ae?

424
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:46,907
- Han Na.
- SHUHUA.

425
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,136
(Woo Il was slightly faster.)

426
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:49,137
- Han Na.
- What?

427
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:51,606
(Will even Woo Il get the right answer?)

428
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:52,877
"Lady Vengeance."

429
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,416
- That's right.
- Correct.

430
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,116
(Correct!)

431
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,586
(With Woo Il, the weak link, they get 4 questions in a row.)

432
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:01,287
- Hey! Hold on.
- Yes!

433
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:05,126
(They dance to celebrate after each question.)

434
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:06,227
- He got it.
- Nice.

435
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,426
How are they doing this?

436
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,527
(His soulful dancing annoys his opposing team.)

437
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,996
- "Woo Il is here."
- Nice!

438
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:15,296
(They've been doing the same act all day.)

439
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:16,337
My gosh.

440
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:17,537
That's crazy.

441
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,807
(She's never experienced this in her life.)

442
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:21,036
(Woo Il suddenly looks handsome.)

443
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:22,376
- It's all about the momentum.
- Yes.

444
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:24,537
- This is annoying.
- His dance is strangely annoying.

445
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:27,646
Seriously. Can you stand in the flower garden?

446
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:28,846
- Over there.
- Yes.

447
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:30,146
- We just need one.
- Seriously.

448
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:31,823
- We'll gain momentum then.
- Let's try it.

449
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:33,087
We're in trouble.

450
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,686
- Hey, this is hard.
- It's hard.

451
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,626
- Why is it so hard?
- Gosh, this isn't easy.

452
00:12:37,627 --> 00:12:38,787
- Here it goes.
- Yes.

453
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:40,896
- Say SHUHUA.
- This isn't right.

454
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:42,227
Two, three. Ta-da.

455
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:45,367
(There are four people this time.)

456
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:46,837
- What?
- Han Na.

457
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:48,466
Han Na. Three.

458
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,866
(Team Han Na was faster again.)

459
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,267
- Three, two...
- "Train to Busan."

460
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:52,636
- What?
- "Train to Busan."

461
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:53,706
- That's right.
- I got it.

462
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:54,707
- What?
- "Train to Busan."

463
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,707
- That's right.
- Correct.

464
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,376
(Team Han Na gets 5 questions in a row.)

465
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,277
Didn't he say, "Brain to Busan?"

466
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:01,246
- I thought he said "The Unjust."
- "The Unjust."

467
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,393
- "Brain to Busan?"
- "Brain to Busan?"

468
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:03,647
- "Brain to Busan?"
- Nice!

469
00:13:03,747 --> 00:13:06,186
- Nice!
- Nice!

470
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:08,067
- That was simple.
- Gosh, only Han Na remains.

471
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,226
My mind is going blank.

472
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:11,526
This is crazy. Seriously.

473
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:13,026
- Han Na.
- Han Na.

474
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:14,427
- Han Na.
- Oh, no.

475
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:17,426
(Singing a song just for Han Na)

476
00:13:17,427 --> 00:13:18,966
- There's only 1 Han Na - There's only 1 Han Na

477
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:20,296
- There can't be 2 Han Nas - There can't be 2 Han Nas

478
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:21,637
(Feeling bitter)

479
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,296
Kang Han Na.

480
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:24,536
(They'll win Round 1 with a perfect score if she gets it right.)

481
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,737
- What do I do?
- Well...

482
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,576
- Come here, HANHAE. Dex.
- Let's line up.

483
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:28,936
- The members of the show...
- Listen up.

484
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:30,146
Aren't good at this.

485
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:31,777
- This is a hard one.
- Dex.

486
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,716
- Is this the best you can do?
- It's not that.

487
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:34,746
- So...
- This is hard.

488
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,146
- I can sleep anywhere.
- Well...

489
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:37,716
- But we need to eat.
- Let's have dinner.

490
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,546
- Dex, I'm not seeing that gaze.
- Let's try this.

491
00:13:39,547 --> 00:13:41,156
- I'll try.
- I need to see that intense gaze.

492
00:13:41,157 --> 00:13:42,216
Are you here to have fun?

493
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:44,356
- I can't think straight.
- You're dressed comfortably.

494
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,386
- Are you here to have fun?
- It's okay.

495
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:46,686
Hold on. Everyone, take off your jacket.

496
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:47,926
- We all feel hot. That's why.
- Right.

497
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,256
- That's why.
- That must be it.

498
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:50,426
- Hey, you need to wake up.
- We couldn't get it right.

499
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:52,326
Take off your jacket now.

500
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,037
(Meanwhile, Team Han Na...)

501
00:13:54,337 --> 00:13:55,666
(Singing an encore of the Han Na Song)

502
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,066
- If there are 2, then there are 2 - If there are 2, then there are 2

503
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,567
(Having fun teasing them)

504
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:03,276
(The big festival of mockery on 2 Days 1 Night)

505
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,777
- Hey.
- That's annoying me.

506
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:07,076
- He's annoyed.
- Gosh.

507
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:09,116
- He's annoyed right now.
- Hey.

508
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:10,346
- I must stay calm.
- Yes, that's it.

509
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:11,447
Let me stay calm.

510
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:13,386
- My gosh. I'm so nervous.
- All right.

511
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:14,417
- Here we go.
- Please.

512
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,186
(Team SHUHUA is in a crisis.)

513
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:19,057
(Team Han Na is so close to victory.)

514
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,426
One, two, three. Ta-da.

515
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,596
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho.

516
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:23,826
- SHUHUA.
- Three, two,

517
00:14:23,827 --> 00:14:25,227
- one. Out of time.
- SHUHUA.

518
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:27,047
- Four, three, - I can't remember it. Wait.

519
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:28,867
- two, one.
- No, wait.

520
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:30,366
- Isn't that...
- Is it my turn?

521
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:31,406
- Out of time.
- That's...

522
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:32,436
Hold on.

523
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:33,636
- I can't just say random titles.
- I know this one.

524
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:34,877
Han Na. "The Witch."

525
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,076
- Wrong.
- I know this one.

526
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,276
(HANHAE seems to know the answer.)

527
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:40,577
Remember it then!

528
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:42,916
No. That's not it. I must know this one.

529
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,116
(Dex even starred on a variety show with Yum Jung Ah.)

530
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,086
- It's a movie about female divers.
- Come on. Go away.

531
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:47,693
- It's a movie about female divers.
- That's Yum Jung Ah.

532
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:49,456
(It's on the tip of Seon Ho's tongue too.)

533
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:50,527
That one.

534
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:53,127
I even went to the premiere of this.

535
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:54,756
- That's...
- So...

536
00:14:54,757 --> 00:14:56,326
(Go Min Si and Yum Jung Ah were in this movie...)

537
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:57,966
(about female divers. What's the title?)

538
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,666
- Their time is up.
- They discussed it.

539
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,196
- They're discussing it.
- You can't discuss it.

540
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:02,537
They're taking way too long.

541
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:04,137
I know this one.

542
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,797
- I went to the movie premiere.
- Wait.

543
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:07,476
- So it's a movie.
- Isn't this our turn?

544
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:09,006
Give us the initial of the first syllable.

545
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:10,506
- Do you want a hint?
- What if they don't know?

546
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:12,077
- Yes.
- All right.

547
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:13,916
I'll tell you one more actor who was in the movie.

548
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,776
- No. Don't do that.
- No. Give us the initial.

549
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:16,916
- What?
- Tell us.

550
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,287
I know this one.

551
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:20,627
Give us the initial of the first syllable.

552
00:15:20,757 --> 00:15:22,516
The initial of the first syllable?

553
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:24,186
- Yes. The initial of the title.
- Yes.

554
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:25,327
The very first syllable.

555
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:27,796
- What?
- The initial...

556
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:29,397
- of the first syllable is...
- Yes?

557
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,997
- S.
- S? My gosh.

558
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,266
S?

559
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,996
(S...)

560
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:35,997
- S?
- Yes.

561
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:37,183
(Double checking due to his bad pronunciation)

562
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:39,537
(The title of the movie with the initial, S, is...)

563
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:42,936
("Smugglers.")

564
00:15:42,937 --> 00:15:44,376
- S?
- SHUHUA.

565
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,547
- Go ahead.
- "Mapado."

566
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:46,806
- Wrong.
- My gosh.

567
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:48,616
- It's your turn now.
- But I have no idea.

568
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:50,686
Nothing comes to my mind about the combination.

569
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:52,417
No. I went to the premiere of this movie.

570
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:55,016
Hey. Just say a movie that begins with S.

571
00:15:55,017 --> 00:15:56,416
- You can't discuss it.
- Give us one more initial.

572
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:57,886
Give us one more initial.

573
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:59,026
- One more.
- Give us the second one then.

574
00:15:59,027 --> 00:16:00,226
- The second initial...
- Yes.

575
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,626
- I'll tell you the second initial.
- I don't know what it is.

576
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,627
Yes.

577
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:04,652
- The second initial is...
- So it's...

578
00:16:04,783 --> 00:16:05,783
This is hard.

579
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:07,223
It's M.

580
00:16:07,523 --> 00:16:08,582
What is it?

581
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,682
(They still don't know what it is.)

582
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:10,359
SHUHUA.

583
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:12,214
- The second initial is...
- So it's...

584
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,514
This is hard.

585
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,854
It's M.

586
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:16,791
What is it?

587
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,030
(They still don't know what it is.)

588
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:19,031
- SHUHUA.
- Go ahead.

589
00:16:19,032 --> 00:16:20,300
- "Scandal Makers."
- Come on.

590
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:21,360
- Wrong.
- Be quiet!

591
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:22,630
- She'll only have five seconds now.
- I know this one.

592
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:23,670
- Let her waste her turn.
- I know this.

593
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:24,730
All right. Five,

594
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:25,770
- She'll only have five seconds now.
- four,

595
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:26,940
- Han Na.
- three,

596
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:28,100
- No.
- two...

597
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:29,570
- Five, - She'll only have five seconds.

598
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,640
- four, - Let her waste her turn.

599
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:31,670
- three, - I know what it is.

600
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:33,210
- two, one.
- I know this one.

601
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:34,811
- But I can't figure it out.
- Han Na!

602
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,279
(She calls out her name right when her time is up.)

603
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,450
- What is it?
- We're doomed.

604
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,919
- Five...
- Can I say it?

605
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,079
- Yes.
- Gosh.

606
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,149
We're doomed.

607
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,519
(Will Team SHUHUA lose without getting a point?)

608
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,049
(Please get it wrong.)

609
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,189
- Can I say it?
- Yes.

610
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,220
"Smugglers."

611
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,789
- That's the one.
- I watched it...

612
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,430
- in the theater.
- Yes, this is the one.

613
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,189
- Darn it.
- I watched it...

614
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,099
- in the theater.
- Yes, it's "Smugglers."

615
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,340
- I really liked it.
- Correct.

616
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,169
(Team Han Na wins with the perfect score of 6 to 0.)

617
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,499
Let's sing the song.

618
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,899
(Here's the original dance.)

619
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,440
(Everyone is quiet.)

620
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,139
- What? What's he doing?
- My gosh.

621
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,779
(Nice!)

622
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,379
(What's Dex doing here?)

623
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,449
- What's he doing?
- What?

624
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,079
- Woo Il and Dex.
- What's going on?

625
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,149
- I'm here.
- What's Dex doing here?

626
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,649
- What's going on?
- Nice.

627
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,019
(Dex is here to get some food.)

628
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,300
- He wants some food.
- My gosh.

629
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,819
- He wants to eat.
- Just for food.

630
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,959
- Hey.
- I need to eat.

631
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,360
It's just one game.

632
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,759
- Okay.
- Nice.

633
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,599
- Nice.
- Nice.

634
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Who said it had three syllables?

635
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:30,429
I was thinking about three-syllable titles. I knew "Smugglers" too.

636
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,299
- Someone said it had 3 syllables.
- Someone said it had 3 syllables.

637
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,439
- It was you, right?
- No, it wasn't me.

638
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,639
- It was you, right?
- No.

639
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,839
Wait. Who was it?

640
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,209
Who said the title had three syllables?

641
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,210
- It was you, right?
- It was the staff.

642
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:39,239
- It wasn't me.
- No.

643
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,339
- We need to figure it out.
- I heard it had three syllables.

644
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,379
- It wasn't me.
- It's one of you.

645
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,779
It really wasn't me.

646
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,349
- Hey, I knew the answer.
- I...

647
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,909
- I heard it had three syllables.
- It wasn't me.

648
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,449
Someone messed it up. I doubted my answer.

649
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,879
We should ask the sound engineer.

650
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,796
Someone on our team said the title had three syllables.

651
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,089
(We'll let you know in case you're curious.)

652
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,159
I know this one.

653
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,359
(HANHAE was getting close to the answer.)

654
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,660
- Remember it then!
- My gosh.

655
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,059
- Jong Min...
- I can say it too. I know it too.

656
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,659
The title has three syllables.

657
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,669
(The culprit was Dex.)

658
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,800
- Three syllables?
- Gosh.

659
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,039
(That's why Se Yoon has been saying three-syllable titles.)

660
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,610
- Really?
- It was Dex?

661
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,710
- I guess it was me.
- You!

662
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,439
- You punk!
- I'm sorry.

663
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,140
My gosh. I put my team in trouble.

664
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,779
- Round One goes to Team Han Na.
- Yes.

665
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,450
- You won 100 points.
- Yes!

666
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,819
All right.

667
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,489
Round 2 is the 6-Syllable Word Quiz.

668
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,089
- Okay. Nice.
- Why does this...

669
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,220
This will be hard.

670
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,660
This will be better for us.

671
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,289
You will look at the initials and guess the six-syllable word.

672
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,059
- Okay. Great.
- You must all guess one syllable.

673
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,060
- What?
- My gosh.

674
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:36,199
- Oh, my gosh.
- That will be hard then.

675
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,299
- That's hard.
- My gosh.

676
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,669
You'll go in the order of the seats. For Team SHUHUA,

677
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,170
Dex will go 1st. Seon Ho will go 2nd.

678
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,809
Se Yoon, 3rd. DinDin, 4th. SHUHUA, 5th. HANHAE, 6th.

679
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,909
- Okay.
- The first syllable is important.

680
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,416
- What do you mean?
- Only the initials.

681
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,639
- Here's an example.
- Did you get it?

682
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,049
- Say it's G, N, D, R, M, B.
- Yes.

683
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,479
- If those are the initials...
- Okay.

684
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,509
- Ga.
- Ga.

685
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,519
- Na. Da.
- Na.

686
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,950
- Ra. Ma. Ba.
- Ra. Ma. Ba.

687
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,150
We guess only one syllable each.

688
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:57,189
- We must complete it as a team.
- We must complete it.

689
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,549
- That's the idea.
- Yes, we must complete it together.

690
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,289
- We must complete the expression.
- That's right.

691
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,489
The teams will alternate...

692
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,459
- to answer the question.
- Okay.

693
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,960
The 1st team to get 3 questions will win the round.

694
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,929
- The team will get 100 points too.
- I see.

695
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,999
- Did everyone understand it?
- We all got it.

696
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
- Yes.
- What?

697
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,300
Can we help SHUHUA with her answer?

698
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,739
- Is that allowed?
- We should let her.

699
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,569
- Only Seon Ho can help her.
- My gosh.

700
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,809
- Why only me?
- Okay.

701
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,680
- She's your friend.
- They're not that close.

702
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,109
- We're closer now.
- She's your friend.

703
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,879
Since she's his friend, only Seon Ho can help her.

704
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
But I'm not good at this.

705
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,979
- What about our seats?
- Then...

706
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,489
SHUHUA should go last.

707
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,919
- Seon Ho should sit next to her.
- Yes.

708
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,959
- You can finish the last part.
- I see. Finish the last part.

709
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
- The last part.
- For the last part.

710
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:36,721
- You're okay with going first?
- You do it.

711
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,659
- I'm good where I am.
- You can go first.

712
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,159
- I like the energy of my seat.
- Or should I start?

713
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,229
- You should start.
- Should I go first?

714
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,299
- I like this seat.
- You come here.

715
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,699
If you're confident, you do it.

716
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,029
- Try it.
- That's an important position.

717
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,299
- I'm sure you'll do well.
- Try it.

718
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,399
- You must be confident.
- Yes.

719
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,500
- Nice.
- Good.

720
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,209
- If you can't, we'll switch.
- Okay.

721
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,539
- Give it a try first.
- All right.

722
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,109
- Who will go first?
- We will.

723
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,379
- Is that okay?
- That's...

724
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,939
- Let's go.
- It won't matter.

725
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,179
- You'll get different questions.
- Okay.

726
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,020
They will start with the first question.

727
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,879
Can you observe them to make sure they don't cheat?

728
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
- Okay.
- My gosh.

729
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,089
- We're good observers.
- They can't discuss the answers.

730
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,689
We can't cheat since we can't talk.

731
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,859
If possible, put down the sketchbook when you write.

732
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,189
- Don't write it like this.
- Wait.

733
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,629
If they do, they can look at each other's answer.

734
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,059
- Then we can see our answers.
- Our answers will be visible.

735
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,129
- In case they're visible?
- Okay.

736
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,229
- Keep it close to your face.
- Then DinDin might talk.

737
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,169
If I do, they can see me.

738
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,170
- So what?
- Can someone...

739
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:20,169
from Recording listen to DinDin?

740
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,999
(You'll take it that far?)

741
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,339
(Nice one, Director Joo.)

742
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,609
- It's an act of love.
- It is.

743
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,130
- That's personalized attention.
- Go.

744
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,440
Go.

745
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,279
We'll start with Team SHUHUA. Here it goes.

746
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,609
(The first question for Team SHUHUA)

747
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,680
One, two, three. Ta-da.

748
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,149
One.

749
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,719
(An electronic device)

750
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,090
Ta-da. One, two,

751
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,390
- three, four.
- What?

752
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,799
- five, six...
- I don't know.

753
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,499
(F, R)

754
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,499
(What's that?)

755
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,070
Five, six...

756
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,699
- One, two, - Wait.

757
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,240
- Y.
- three, four,

758
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,409
five, six...

759
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,539
(Itching to reveal the answer)

760
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,839
- Seven.
- DinDin wants to say it.

761
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,110
- DinDin wants to say it.
- Please.

762
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,450
- Gosh. What's this?
- Se Yoon.

763
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,250
Fryer?

764
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,080
- They didn't cheat.
- Air fryer.

765
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,549
- I see.
- All right.

766
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,189
- They must be done.
- Air fryer.

767
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,919
(What's the answer for their first question?)

768
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,960
(Air fryer)

769
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,230
(DinDin sees SHUHUA's answer, Y.)

770
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,829
(Her answer must be "E-R.")

771
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,830
- Wait, SHUHUA.
- I see.

772
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:25,299
- Hurry, please.
- You must write down your answer.

773
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,799
- Did you write it, SHUHUA?
- Listen to DinDin carefully now.

774
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
- Yes.
- Er...

775
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,899
- She wrote it down.
- Er...

776
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,039
- Did everyone finish? Let's check.
- Er...

777
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,209
- All right.
- She wrote it down.

778
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,339
- Er...
- Let's check.

779
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,340
- Er... What?
- She wrote it down.

780
00:21:34,341 --> 00:21:35,939
- Come on. You can't say, "er."
- Come on.

781
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,979
- I couldn't hear her.
- My gosh.

782
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,580
- He's cheating.
- Let's check it out.

783
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,819
- Let's start with DinDin.
- Right.

784
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,280
- A.
- Hold it higher.

785
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,990
- Ir.
- Please.

786
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,289
- Ir.
- My gosh.

787
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,559
(Shocked)

788
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,860
Please, Se Yoon. You use this often!

789
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,260
(Surprised)

790
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:52,360
- Air fryer.
- This...

791
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,230
- Play?
- Phone.

792
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,499
(Air...)

793
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,529
Phone? Air phone?

794
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,399
- Phone?
- Air phone.

795
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,429
- My gosh.
- Dex.

796
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,469
- Ro.
- Ro?

797
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,100
- What is that?
- No?

798
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
Air Phone Ro?

799
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:04,370
- Y.
- Y.

800
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,909
(Seon Ho and SHUHUA get it right.)

801
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,910
- What?
- Yes!

802
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:08,039
- SHUHUA got it right.
- What's the answer?

803
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,809
- Air fryer.
- No way.

804
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,950
Air fryer!

805
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,449
- I didn't know...
- I thought it was "earphone."

806
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,479
But I got lucky.

807
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,419
- Darn it.
- You...

808
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,679
- You know how to play now, right?
- Yes.

809
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,689
- Okay.
- Yes.

810
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,749
- Air fryer.
- We can do this.

811
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,259
- We can do this.
- This is our chance.

812
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
It's easy. Okay.

813
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,220
- Can we distract them?
- Come on.

814
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,129
- Can we talk?
- First...

815
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,759
- So...
- No. We'll be listening to you.

816
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,959
- I...
- I'll be watching your eyes.

817
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,029
- Don't cheat.
- Yes.

818
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,069
- You can't talk.
- I tend to talk a lot.

819
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,369
Play fair. Come on.

820
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,569
- Let's begin.
- We'll play fair.

821
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,890
- One, two, three.
- Don't worry.

822
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,670
Ta-da. One.

823
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,910
(City)

824
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,980
Two, three,

825
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,810
- four, - Okay.

826
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,980
Five...

827
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,949
(B)

828
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,549
(N)

829
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,990
(K)

830
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,889
Five, six...

831
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,259
- Okay.
- No one is writing it down.

832
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,589
- Seven.
- Okay.

833
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,090
- I got it.
- Okay. I figured it out.

834
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,159
- Hey, this is great.
- I got it. This is great.

835
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,259
- Two, - Okay.

836
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,429
- one.
- I figured it out.

837
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,900
- I got it.
- Out of time.

838
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,930
- This...
- All right.

839
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,930
- He's changing his answer. What?
- What?

840
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:07,539
- I...
- Hey!

841
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,499
- I didn't write it down yet.
- Hey.

842
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,739
I swear. He had "Bil."

843
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,369
- But after talking to Jong Min, - No.

844
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,439
- he suddenly changed to "Bal."
- What?

845
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,539
- I didn't talk to Jong Min.
- No.

846
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,739
- That's it.
- He doesn't know the answer.

847
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,179
- He changed his answer too.
- Okay.

848
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,049
- Let's check the answer.
- Let's go.

849
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,379
- I'm sorry. But...
- We don't know if he got it right.

850
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,680
I wrote mine in English.

851
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,589
- Let's go.
- All right. Let's check.

852
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,326
- In the English pronunciation.
- Okay. Here we go.

853
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,449
Let's check.

854
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,690
- Ko.
- Ta.

855
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,690
- Ki.
- My gosh.

856
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,289
(Will they succeed right away?)

857
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,360
No.

858
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,359
- Bal.
- Le.

859
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,430
(City: Kota Kinobale)

860
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,430
- Kota Kinobale.
- Kota Kinobale.

861
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,739
- Bale? What were you thinking?
- It's English, though.

862
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,939
- I didn't know it.
- It's English.

863
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,609
- Kota Kinabalu.
- Kota Kinabalu.

864
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,639
- Kota Kinabalu.
- Kota Kinabalu.

865
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,969
- Kota Kinabalu.
- My gosh.

866
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,839
- All right. Team SHUHUA.
- Team SHUHUA.

867
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,239
- Let's try your second question.
- This is hard.

868
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,710
The third person, please concentrate.

869
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,949
Goodness, it's hard.

870
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,279
- Concentrate.
- Can he switch places?

871
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,579
He should switch with SHUHUA.

872
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,390
Would we succeed even if I switch places?

873
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,619
Se Yoon, take my seat.

874
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,019
Did you get it right the first time?

875
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,319
It won't change anything.

876
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,619
I think I'm better than Se Yoon.

877
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,690
Don't you think?

878
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,229
- This time, - We'll win.

879
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,289
I won't cheat.

880
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,329
- Let's do it properly.
- Okay.

881
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,770
- Here we go.
- Let's give it a try.

882
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,860
Here we go.

883
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:12,230
- I'm probably the best...
- One, two, three.

884
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,430
Ta-da.

885
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,099
- One, two, - Everyone knows this.

886
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,370
- I know this.
- three.

887
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,010
- Be quiet, HANHAE.
- Four,

888
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,210
five, six,

889
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,039
seven.

890
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,609
(A repetitive pattern?)

891
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,849
(Food)

892
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,379
Eight, nine,

893
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,119
- Anyone should know this.
- ten. Time is up.

894
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,519
- Isn't it something I like?
- Yes.

895
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
- All right.
- What?

896
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:33,289
Even SHUHUA recognized it.

897
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,019
(What's the answer that SHUHUA recognized?)

898
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,219
(Food)

899
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,889
(Aglio e olio)

900
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,860
Five, six, seven...

901
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,369
(The two weaklings simply switched seats.)

902
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,270
- Time is up.
- You can't fix your answer now.

903
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,569
- Hey.
- Even SHUHUA recognized it.

904
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,169
- Hey.
- Okay, I finished writing it.

905
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,170
Write down anything.

906
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:52,816
- I didn't write anything.
- Write down anything.

907
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,009
- Here we go.
- It's okay.

908
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,109
- No way.
- Here we go.

909
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,049
- What are you doing?
- I didn't look.

910
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,809
Hey, DinDin cheated again.

911
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,949
Raise your hand.

912
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,349
- Why would you cheat?
- I'm raising my hand.

913
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,950
He cheated, so it's over.

914
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,319
(Food, O)

915
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,659
(Se Yoon had to write the fourth syllable.)

916
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,059
(Thinking hard)

917
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,890
Raise your hand.

918
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,029
(Raise your hand.)

919
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,030
- Raise your hand.
- Raise your hand.

920
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:15,259
- Why would you cheat?
- Raise your hand.

921
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,760
- He cheated, so it's over.
- No.

922
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,199
- Se Yoon got it wrong anyway.
- "Raise your hand?"

923
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,230
Is that so? Okay.

924
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,300
(My answer is wrong?)

925
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
What are you doing?

926
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
- This is frustrating.
- What?

927
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:23,369
I'm about to lose my mind.

928
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,610
I wrote an answer.

929
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,709
I don't know what the answer is.

930
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,979
- But this is so easy.
- It's hard.

931
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,180
It's really easy.

932
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,256
- Let's find out your answer.
- It's so easy.

933
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,409
- "Ag."
- SHUHUA...

934
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,949
- "Li."
- "Yi."

935
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,220
(Yi)

936
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,150
Why you...

937
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,750
- "Agli..."
- Dex!

938
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,330
- You didn't guess right.
- What's your answer?

939
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,790
Isn't it something like "aglio?"

940
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,390
- Am I wrong?
- What is it?

941
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,259
Isn't it alio e olio something?

942
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,260
What did you write as your answer?

943
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:48,459
- He wrote "agl."
- Aglio aglio.

944
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,999
- "Aglio aglio?"
- "Aglio aglio?"

945
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Gosh.

946
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:52,229
- What's the answer?
- Aglio e...

947
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,039
Aglio e olio.

948
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,199
- How could they get it wrong?
- I never eat this dish.

949
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,339
Aglio e olio.

950
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,769
"Aglio e olio?" What is it?

951
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,640
- Aglio e olio.
- I never eat that.

952
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,109
That was difficult.

953
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,550
- Aglio e olio.
- That's not right..

954
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,030
Change it to one round to determine the winner.

955
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,779
- It's not easy.
- Why are you giving us...

956
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,980
hard questions just because we have guests?

957
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,989
- It's very advanced.
- It's really difficult.

958
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,219
Ask us something like 3 times 6.

959
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,060
We have to answer correctly to eat.

960
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,590
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

961
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,000
If both teams are okay with it,

962
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,799
the 1st team to get 2 questions right instead of 3...

963
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,229
- That sounds better.
- Let's do that.

964
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,230
That's better.

965
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:27,346
- It might change to one question.
- The team to get...

966
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,940
one question right could be the winner.

967
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,269
- Okay.
- You have ten seconds.

968
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,669
- We got it.
- Concentrate.

969
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,070
One, two, three.

970
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,379
- Ta-da.
- That's so easy.

971
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,380
- That's easy.
- One,

972
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,380
- two.
- Okay.

973
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,380
- Immediately...
- Hold on.

974
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:39,349
- Okay.
- It's so easy.

975
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,319
- This is so easy.
- Okay.

976
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,819
- You'd better get this one right.
- We got this.

977
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,949
- Or I'll make you pay.
- Here we go.

978
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,049
We can do it.

979
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,319
- If you get it wrong, you'll pay.
- Okay.

980
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,389
- Let's find out the answer.
- Here we go.

981
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,390
"Mani."

982
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,690
- "La."
- "Clam."

983
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,190
- "Kal."
- "Guk."

984
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,729
- "Su."
- Yes.

985
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:56,330
(Manila clam kalguksu)

986
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,929
- Nice.
- But this is easy.

987
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,899
- It's such a popular dish.
- Nice.

988
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,599
- Compared to aglio e olio...
- You can't give olio e aglio...

989
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,639
and Manila clam kalguksu.

990
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
Aglio e olio.

991
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:06,109
- What?
- Aglio e olio.

992
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,510
What's the difference?

993
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,950
- Momentarily, my mind went blank.
- Good job.

994
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,680
- Well done.
- Good job.

995
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,790
- All of you are so reliable.
- That was good.

996
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,119
(Our score is 0.)

997
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,519
I thought that you looked amazing on TV.

998
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,659
I can't play this game.

999
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,489
What should I do?

1000
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,089
I can't do it.

1001
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,829
Goodness. I'm drawing a blank.

1002
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,960
There's a huge hole in that team.

1003
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,020
- The hole is too big.
- It's like a black hole.

1004
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,600
It's close to being a sinkhole.

1005
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,770
Can you give us a Korean dish for Se Yoon?

1006
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,799
- Right. Western food is too...
- Aglio e olio.

1007
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,870
- That one is...
- Gosh.

1008
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,039
This is worth trying.

1009
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,109
- Okay.
- Okay.

1010
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,579
- Here we go.
- Give it to us.

1011
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,580
Seriously.

1012
00:27:43,581 --> 00:27:46,050
One, two, three. Ta-da.

1013
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,750
- Okay.
- One,

1014
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,549
- two, three.
- Please.

1015
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,719
Is this it?

1016
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,126
(SHUHUA gets help to write her answer.)

1017
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,190
Okay.

1018
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,559
(Dex is also writing something down.)

1019
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,660
This is...

1020
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:57,990
Okay.

1021
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,060
Okay, we have to get this one right.

1022
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,829
(However, there's one person who's looking lonely.)

1023
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,730
- Please, this is so easy.
- Four,

1024
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,730
five, six,

1025
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,170
seven, eight,

1026
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,910
nine,

1027
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,270
- ten.
- Okay.

1028
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:14,439
What's wrong with him?

1029
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,609
He's such a fool!

1030
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,849
(Groaning)

1031
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,049
Seriously.

1032
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,549
- Did you get it?
- No.

1033
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,649
- He's such a fool.
- No.

1034
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,219
Let's find out the answer.

1035
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,249
Go.

1036
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,049
- What is it?
- He's so foolish.

1037
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,219
- Wait, before we check the answer, - Go.

1038
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,560
Can I switch teams?

1039
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,060
- Can we switch members?
- Wait.

1040
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,259
Hold on.

1041
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,699
We're still one team.

1042
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,829
You can't keep shouting that I'm stupid.

1043
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,969
- Keep it down.
- Let's take a look.

1044
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,069
- All right.
- Didn't I tell you...

1045
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,510
not to scold me when we have guests?

1046
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,500
I told you to scold me quietly inside.

1047
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,740
- "Fi."
- Yes.

1048
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
- "Gu."
- What?

1049
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
- "Re."
- What?

1050
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,180
- "Ska."
- "Ti."

1051
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,479
"Ng."

1052
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,739
- Yes.
- We got it right.

1053
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,749
- "Ti."
- "Ng."

1054
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,750
(What?)

1055
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:52,849
(I'm sorry.)

1056
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,850
What?

1057
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:55,419
We got it right. What's wrong?

1058
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,549
- What?
- What did he write?

1059
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,849
I thought that we got it wrong.

1060
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,949
- Goodness.
- What?

1061
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,220
- What?
- What's going on?

1062
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,119
- What's wrong? He got it right.
- What's wrong?

1063
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,159
- To be honest...
- Then why was your head down?

1064
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,160
To be honest...

1065
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,690
- You startled me.
- I mean...

1066
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,436
I couldn't remember the first few syllables,

1067
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,730
but the end seemed like "kating."

1068
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,699
I only knew that it was related to skating.

1069
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,839
So I just wrote down "ska."

1070
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,770
- But Se Yoon...
- Behind me...

1071
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,909
I thought that I was wrong. I was panicking.

1072
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,039
You know what?

1073
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,149
After writing down his answer, he had his head down.

1074
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,610
I felt so bad about it.

1075
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,319
He kept complaining behind me.

1076
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,679
- No way.
- You did.

1077
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,749
- Let's do it.
- You did.

1078
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,849
- I see.
- You startled me.

1079
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,049
- Let's end it with this round.
- You recognize it...

1080
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,889
when you think about it as slowly as possible.

1081
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,159
- Let's end it.
- Okay.

1082
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,589
- We have ten seconds.
- Slowly.

1083
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,859
Take your time.

1084
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,230
- Okay.
- Take your time.

1085
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,599
We must concentrate.

1086
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,629
- Here we go.
- We can't get it wrong.

1087
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,160
We'll finish it with this round.

1088
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,399
We will.

1089
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,929
One, two, three. Ta-da.

1090
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,199
(Type of TV show)

1091
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,870
- One, two, - Let's see.

1092
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,739
- three, - What is this?

1093
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,209
- four, five, - What do you mean by that?

1094
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,379
- six, - Goodness.

1095
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,500
- seven, - What could it be?

1096
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,879
- eight.
- They don't know.

1097
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,949
I don't know.

1098
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,279
- It's difficult.
- Five,

1099
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,450
- What's this?
- six.

1100
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,219
(The music gives away the answer.)

1101
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,020
("Korea Sings")

1102
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,619
- Eight, - They don't know.

1103
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,889
- nine.
- Jong Min doesn't know.

1104
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,410
- Jong Min doesn't know.
- Time is up.

1105
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,729
(Please)

1106
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,599
You really don't know the answer?

1107
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
It's the first one I don't know.

1108
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:17,929
- You don't recognize it?
- Woo Il doesn't know either.

1109
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,129
(Starting with K)

1110
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,876
- How can they not know?
- How can you not know?

1111
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,299
- Tell them to leave KBS.
- Get ready.

1112
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,239
No way.

1113
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,269
Let's just do it.

1114
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,410
- Oh, no.
- "Jo."

1115
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,039
"Guk."

1116
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,180
- "Joguk?"
- "Nal."

1117
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,980
- "Nal?"
- "Re."

1118
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,850
- "Ja."
- "Ri."

1119
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,479
It's "Korea Sings."

1120
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,920
- "Joguk Nalraejari."
- Gosh.

1121
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,749
You didn't know that it was "Korea Sings?"

1122
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,559
What? I was right.

1123
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,759
- That's true.
- Goodness.

1124
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,196
- How could they not know?
- I just guessed.

1125
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,830
I guessed, but I was right.

1126
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,499
- Everyone.
- Here it is.

1127
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
- Concentrate.
- Concentrate.

1128
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:50,229
- Dex.
- They lost their chance.

1129
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,230
- You can do it.
- Let's end it.

1130
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,230
- We can do it.
- Let's end it.

1131
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:53,529
- You can do it. Keep your head up.
- Let's go.

1132
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,799
- Keep your head up.
- Okay.

1133
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,439
- Keep your head up.
- Let's go.

1134
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,909
If we get this right, we'll win.

1135
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,009
- You can scan it fast.
- Here we go.

1136
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,409
- Scan it fast.
- It's too hard.

1137
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,439
It's a TV show.

1138
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,039
Scan it fast. Don't stare at it.

1139
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,209
- Scan.
- It's the last round.

1140
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,449
- One, two, three.
- This is our chance.

1141
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,849
Ta-da. One, two...

1142
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,850
(Animal)

1143
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:11,750
- Three, four, - I see.

1144
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,620
Five,

1145
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,389
- six, - Okay.

1146
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,490
- That's it.
- seven,

1147
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,489
- I got it.
- eight.

1148
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,730
- Okay.
- Please.

1149
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,800
- I got it.
- Ten.

1150
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,759
- We got it.
- Here we go.

1151
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,799
- We got it.
- We got it.

1152
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,129
- We don't know yet.
- Could the answer be...

1153
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,199
some kind of boxed meal?

1154
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,399
Stop writing.

1155
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,469
(His fingers don't know where to go.)

1156
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,499
No.

1157
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,169
- You can't do that.
- Stop.

1158
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,339
- All right.
- You can't do that.

1159
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,279
- Okay, show us the answer.
- You can't write anymore.

1160
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,710
- "Ba."
- Please.

1161
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,550
- "L."
- "Bal?"

1162
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,880
- "Bal."
- "Bal."

1163
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,250
(Dex, you don't know, do you?)

1164
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,680
- "Bal."
- "Bal."

1165
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,950
"D!"

1166
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,120
(We're almost there.)

1167
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,589
He was right.

1168
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,620
"Ea."

1169
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,590
- What's going on?
- "G."

1170
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,060
"Le."

1171
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,329
(Team SHUHUA wins Round 2.)

1172
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,000
(Earned 100 points)

1173
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,869
(Woo Il lost)

1174
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,539
- Woo Il lost - We can win next time.

1175
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,800
- Okay.
- Woo Il lost

1176
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,139
(I can't believe we lost.)

1177
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,569
I didn't know the answer.

1178
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,280
It was difficult, but we got it.

1179
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,239
- I made a guess.
- I know.

1180
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,779
- You didn't know?
- I didn't.

1181
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,780
- Did you guess?
- I didn't know.

1182
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:13,809
- We got it anyway.
- Did you guess?

1183
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,979
Yes, I guessed.

1184
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,019
- I guessed.
- Really?

1185
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,020
- Yes.
- He guessed.

1186
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:18,350
- That's amazing.
- I guessed.

1187
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,820
(The night deepens, and it's about time they got hungry.)

1188
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,459
Everyone, this is finally Round Three.

1189
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,629
Okay.

1190
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,329
- It's the last round.
- Are you having fun?

1191
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,699
- Are the guests having fun?
- Okay.

1192
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,230
- Yes.
- Yes.

1193
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,669
- This is fun.
- We can do it.

1194
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,799
- We can do it. Let's eat.
- We'll eat.

1195
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,899
- I'm hungry.
- All right.

1196
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,620
- Food sounds delicious.
- This round is...

1197
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,939
- a music quiz.
- A music quiz?

1198
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,009
I don't know much about music.

1199
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,479
Do we guess the title after listening to the intro?

1200
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,109
When we play a song,

1201
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,449
- guess the song title...
- The two of them.

1202
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,349
- He's good at it.
- and the singer.

1203
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,580
- The singer?
- Yes.

1204
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,249
When you answer correctly, you'll go...

1205
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,319
- behind the line like before.
- Behind the line? Okay.

1206
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,619
The first team whose members...

1207
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,520
answer correctly will win.

1208
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,589
We have two members from "Amazing Saturday."

1209
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,110
(We'll turn it into "Amazing Sunday.")

1210
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,489
The song title and...

1211
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,829
Jong Min, don't you know many old songs?

1212
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,659
I do, especially songs from the 90s.

1213
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
(Team Han Na members are just as knowledgeable.)

1214
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:04,929
- I'll do my best.
- Let's get started.

1215
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,930
Are we playing first?

1216
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:07,229
- Get ready.
- Don't hesitate if you know.

1217
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,299
We'll be on offense.

1218
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,339
Here's the first song.

1219
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,540
- Finish it off.
- Play music.

1220
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,339
- SHUHUA.
- Han Na.

1221
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,440
- SHUHUA.
- He was faster.

1222
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,010
- Two, one.
- "Stand By Me" by SHINee.

1223
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,810
- I think it's right.
- Correct.

1224
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,279
Se Yoon did it.

1225
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,619
- Se Yoon.
- That's amazing.

1226
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,620
Se Yoon!

1227
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,620
Correct.

1228
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,720
- We got it.
- Se Yoon.

1229
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,989
- Se Yoon.
- That's amazing.

1230
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,329
Se Yoon.

1231
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,530
"Amazing Saturday."

1232
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,059
He's from "Amazing Saturday."

1233
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,799
("Stand By Me" by SHINee)

1234
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,030
(We can't resist dancing.)

1235
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,270
- That was amazing.
- How does it go?

1236
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,810
- This quiz is exciting.
- Yes.

1237
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,469
KEY, I made it.

1238
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,509
- KEY, are you watching this?
- I love this song.

1239
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,709
That was good.

1240
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,979
- "Stand By Me" by SHINee.
- How amazing.

1241
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,910
- We can dance, can't we?
- He was amazing.

1242
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,220
- Se Yoon is good at this.
- I knew the song too.

1243
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,789
- Se Yoon is very good at it.
- Okay.

1244
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,719
KEY is one of the members on "Amazing Saturday."

1245
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Hey, KEY.

1246
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
Se Yoon...

1247
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:02,919
It's better that Se Yoon goes first.

1248
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,459
- I'll sit apart.
- He did one.

1249
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,829
- Stay out of the group.
- Go back.

1250
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,859
You should go back.

1251
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,999
I'm not that type of person. Don't worry.

1252
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,360
- All right, here's the second song.
- That type of person?

1253
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,470
Play music.

1254
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,499
- SHUHUA.
- SHUHUA.

1255
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,100
- Han Na.
- We were first.

1256
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,010
- No way.
- "Good Day" by IU.

1257
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,339
- Incorrect.
- Let's go.

1258
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,980
- IU. I mean...
- Han Na.

1259
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,480
"You and I" by IU.

1260
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,849
That's right.

1261
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,880
Correct.

1262
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:35,289
("You and I" by IU)

1263
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,360
(Clock hands ticking)

1264
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,189
- Clock hands are ticking.
- That's right.

1265
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,359
(Same clock, different feeling)

1266
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,259
(Acting frivolous)

1267
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,170
(Frivolous duet)

1268
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,639
(A big party where they're brought together by IU)

1269
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,800
What's this?

1270
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,410
What's this?

1271
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,909
- Okay.
- What's wrong with you?

1272
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,739
(Welcome.)

1273
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,010
- We got it.
- Let's move on.

1274
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,280
(Laughing)

1275
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,660
- That's so fascinating.
- Okay.

1276
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,619
- See?
- Good job, Chang Hee.

1277
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,919
That was amazing.

1278
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,849
- Chang Hee is good at it.
- I thought it was "The Red Shoes."

1279
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,920
- The score is 1 to 1.
- We almost had it.

1280
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,519
- Here we go.
- You knew the song?

1281
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,659
(Not at all)

1282
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,220
Dex keeps repeating that it's a bummer.

1283
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,300
- Here's the next song.
- Here it is.

1284
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,999
- Seon Ho.
- Joon.

1285
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,469
- What's the name? Han Na.
- What was that?

1286
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,730
"Supernova" by aespa.

1287
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,000
He's amazing.

1288
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,469
What?

1289
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,909
("Supernova" by aespa)

1290
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,939
Good job.

1291
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,980
Correct.

1292
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,210
What?

1293
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:33,850
(His dance reflex)

1294
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,179
Are your joints okay?

1295
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,180
Look at him.

1296
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:37,381
- Are your joints okay?
- Yes.

1297
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,489
- Is it painful?
- That's the dog leg dance.

1298
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,889
It's the dog leg dance.

1299
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,459
(His dance has nothing in common with the choreography.)

1300
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,529
- Isn't this it?
- Supernova

1301
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,630
- Nova.
- Gosh, that looks nasty.

1302
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,146
- Is that even right?
- This movement suits you better.

1303
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,099
- This is better.
- You look like a middle-aged man.

1304
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,269
- That was amazing.
- This is good.

1305
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,469
(Seon Ho wins for the second time.)

1306
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,340
- Get a grip now.
- Good job, Seon Ho.

1307
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,050
- I'll help her with the answer.
- Sit in the front.

1308
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,109
He must have watched it so many times.

1309
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,109
At the sound of the thud...

1310
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,256
(Did he answer after hearing the thud?)

1311
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
(Thud)

1312
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,980
Seon Ho. I mean, SHUHUA.

1313
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,120
"Supernova" by aespa.

1314
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,190
(Thud)

1315
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,120
(It's even before she turns around.)

1316
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,290
- He's good at it.
- He's very good.

1317
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,300
This isn't looking good.

1318
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,799
Two people from Team SHUHUA finished.

1319
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,320
Only one from the other team finished.

1320
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,169
We'll continue.

1321
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,370
I hope that it's an old song.

1322
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,880
I wouldn't know if it's an old song.

1323
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,640
We have to call out "Han Na."

1324
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:34,940
Play music.

1325
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,540
- Han Na.
- Han Na.

1326
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,979
It's an old song.

1327
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,549
- By Pinocchio.
- Two.

1328
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,849
- "You and I Together."
- SHUHUA.

1329
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:42,949
"Between Love and Friendship..."

1330
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,190
- by Pinocchio.
- That's right.

1331
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,450
- That's right.
- Correct.

1332
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,489
- Yes.
- Good job.

1333
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:53,459
("Between Love and Friendship" by Pinocchio)

1334
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,530
(Why don't we dance together?)

1335
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,459
(Turning lightly)

1336
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,530
I'm sorry.

1337
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,469
(More than myself)

1338
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,269
(More than anyone in this world)

1339
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,379
(I hate myself for caring about you)

1340
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,480
Well done.

1341
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,279
- How did you know?
- Well done.

1342
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
- I figured it out from Pinocchio.
- By the way...

1343
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,750
- Gosh.
- I knew it.

1344
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,919
- I knew the answer.
- I didn't.

1345
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,349
I wish I could tell you.

1346
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,350
Goodness.

1347
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,619
I thought you'd know when you said it was Pinocchio.

1348
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,829
I thought you'd recognize it when you said Pinocchio.

1349
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,830
I drew a blank.

1350
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,190
We gave them the answer.

1351
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,100
That's really unfortunate.

1352
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,129
We'll move on.

1353
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,570
Play music.

1354
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,939
- SHUHUA.
- Han Na.

1355
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,400
Han Na was faster.

1356
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,023
- Han Na.
- Han Na.

1357
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:39,102
Play music.

1358
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:42,071
- SHUHUA.
- Han Na.

1359
00:37:42,072 --> 00:37:43,202
Han Na was faster.

1360
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:44,501
- Han Na.
- Han Na.

1361
00:37:44,502 --> 00:37:45,942
"As If It's Your Last" by BLACKPINK.

1362
00:37:46,702 --> 00:37:47,872
- Correct.
- Yes!

1363
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:49,442
(Crying)

1364
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:50,881
Correct.

1365
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:52,141
What? How is that possible?

1366
00:37:52,142 --> 00:37:53,218
(How did he even guess it?)

1367
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:54,881
("As If It's Your Last" by BLACKPINK)

1368
00:37:54,882 --> 00:37:56,212
SHUHUA.

1369
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:58,621
- Look at him.
- I'm sorry.

1370
00:37:58,622 --> 00:38:00,152
(Woo Il's dancing time)

1371
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:01,291
Get out of the way.

1372
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:03,251
- Get out of the way.
- Get out of the way.

1373
00:38:03,252 --> 00:38:05,862
(This is such a bummer.)

1374
00:38:08,992 --> 00:38:11,931
- Get out of the way.
- Get out of the way.

1375
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:13,308
- Get out of the way.
- I didn't know.

1376
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:16,202
(Everyone, move out. SHUHUA is here.)

1377
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:22,611
(She gets embarrassed quickly.)

1378
00:38:22,612 --> 00:38:24,211
There was no one helping her.

1379
00:38:24,212 --> 00:38:26,111
(You can dance again, Woo Il.)

1380
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:27,281
(Welcome.)

1381
00:38:27,282 --> 00:38:28,282
(Welcome.)

1382
00:38:28,982 --> 00:38:30,752
Look at him dancing.

1383
00:38:30,882 --> 00:38:32,251
I thought that he was a woman.

1384
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:33,951
From the back, I thought that he was a woman.

1385
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:35,721
(A clean finish with hair shaking)

1386
00:38:35,722 --> 00:38:37,122
I thought that you were BLACKPINK.

1387
00:38:37,662 --> 00:38:39,161
- Let's move on.
- We have a long way to go.

1388
00:38:39,162 --> 00:38:40,162
All right.

1389
00:38:40,163 --> 00:38:41,761
- It's 4 to 3.
- Good job.

1390
00:38:41,762 --> 00:38:43,831
- Okay.
- You don't know any, do you?

1391
00:38:43,832 --> 00:38:45,901
- We're still here.
- We're in trouble.

1392
00:38:45,902 --> 00:38:47,801
- You aren't here just to watch.
- HANHAE.

1393
00:38:47,802 --> 00:38:49,071
- No.
- Give it a try.

1394
00:38:49,072 --> 00:38:50,401
Aren't you usually good at it?

1395
00:38:50,402 --> 00:38:52,071
I'm taking my time right now.

1396
00:38:52,072 --> 00:38:54,472
- Okay.
- Stop being ridiculous and do it.

1397
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:57,482
That's nonsense. Taking your time, my foot.

1398
00:38:57,882 --> 00:38:59,511
I don't think Woo Il knows any either.

1399
00:38:59,512 --> 00:39:01,012
- Right.
- Here we go.

1400
00:39:01,582 --> 00:39:03,212
Play music.

1401
00:39:06,022 --> 00:39:07,121
- Han Na.
- Han Na.

1402
00:39:07,122 --> 00:39:08,422
- How...
- Han Na.

1403
00:39:08,652 --> 00:39:11,862
"We Are the Future" by H.O.T.

1404
00:39:12,022 --> 00:39:13,022
Correct.

1405
00:39:13,962 --> 00:39:15,162
I got goosebumps.

1406
00:39:16,432 --> 00:39:17,532
You know this, right?

1407
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:20,332
Okay. Here we go.

1408
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:26,372
(The old boys get excited to recall their past.)

1409
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:31,681
(Catching her eyes)

1410
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:33,441
(Han Na, the deity of dance, is also in awe.)

1411
00:39:33,442 --> 00:39:35,251
(In a trance)

1412
00:39:35,252 --> 00:39:36,952
(He never stops being fascinating.)

1413
00:39:37,782 --> 00:39:39,551
- Be careful.
- Two, three, four.

1414
00:39:39,552 --> 00:39:41,052
Don't step over this line.

1415
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:42,991
(I won't listen)

1416
00:39:42,992 --> 00:39:44,321
That was great.

1417
00:39:44,322 --> 00:39:45,461
- Good job.
- Okay.

1418
00:39:45,462 --> 00:39:47,021
"We Are the Future."

1419
00:39:47,022 --> 00:39:48,731
We know songs from this time period.

1420
00:39:48,732 --> 00:39:51,461
We know songs from this generation.

1421
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:53,131
I thought it was "A Match Made in Heaven."

1422
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:54,802
- I have no idea.
- We're in trouble.

1423
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:56,301
The next one will be more recent.

1424
00:39:56,302 --> 00:39:58,678
Dex, did you like any idol group when you were in the military?

1425
00:39:58,702 --> 00:40:00,401
- I liked TWICE.
- You'd better answer if it's TWICE.

1426
00:40:00,402 --> 00:40:01,571
We should get a song by TWICE.

1427
00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:03,471
- If there's no song by TWICE...
- Dex only knows TWICE.

1428
00:40:03,472 --> 00:40:05,472
- I'm hoping for TWICE.
- Give us a song by TWICE.

1429
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:06,682
(Each team has 3 members remaining.)

1430
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:07,843
You have to play one for Dex.

1431
00:40:09,112 --> 00:40:10,651
Is there a song from the 80s?

1432
00:40:10,652 --> 00:40:11,798
(Which team will break the tie?)

1433
00:40:11,822 --> 00:40:13,252
Play music.

1434
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:16,092
- SHUHUA.
- SHUHUA.

1435
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,991
She got this one.

1436
00:40:17,992 --> 00:40:19,092
She got it no matter what.

1437
00:40:19,162 --> 00:40:22,291
- Three, two, one.
- He's telling her.

1438
00:40:22,292 --> 00:40:23,432
By TWS.

1439
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,331
"Plot Twist."

1440
00:40:25,332 --> 00:40:26,761
- This is...
- Han Na.

1441
00:40:26,762 --> 00:40:27,901
- "Plot..."
- The pronunciation is important.

1442
00:40:27,902 --> 00:40:30,271
- This is...
- He keeps telling her the answer.

1443
00:40:30,272 --> 00:40:31,301
- It's a little...
- The answer...

1444
00:40:31,302 --> 00:40:32,371
Wait a minute.

1445
00:40:32,372 --> 00:40:34,002
- It's okay.
- She knows the answer,

1446
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:35,141
but it's hard for her to pronounce it.

1447
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:37,481
- Come on.
- What's going on here?

1448
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:39,212
He sang the entire first verse to her.

1449
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:42,122
- He sang the entire first verse.
- The pronunciation is hard.

1450
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,122
- Dex.
- He sang the entire first verse.

1451
00:40:44,222 --> 00:40:46,281
- Go back to your places.
- This is wrong.

1452
00:40:46,282 --> 00:40:47,951
- It's hard for her to pronounce.
- Calm down.

1453
00:40:47,952 --> 00:40:48,952
(The predator keeps them in order.)

1454
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:50,792
He sang the entire song for her.

1455
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:52,492
No, go back to your place.

1456
00:40:52,592 --> 00:40:54,792
- How is this possible?
- It's hard to pronounce.

1457
00:40:55,062 --> 00:40:56,531
Let's hear her answer.

1458
00:40:56,532 --> 00:40:57,731
- What's the answer?
- Let's hear it.

1459
00:40:57,732 --> 00:40:59,062
- What's the answer?
- By TWS.

1460
00:40:59,902 --> 00:41:01,301
The song is called...

1461
00:41:01,302 --> 00:41:02,801
"Plot Twist."

1462
00:41:02,802 --> 00:41:04,671
- That's correct.
- "Plot Twist."

1463
00:41:04,672 --> 00:41:06,071
The title is long and hard to pronounce.

1464
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:07,442
- Correct.
- Yes.

1465
00:41:08,642 --> 00:41:15,912
("Plot Twist" by TWS)

1466
00:41:18,152 --> 00:41:19,381
Woo Il.

1467
00:41:19,382 --> 00:41:20,952
(Woo Il's sudden attack)

1468
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:23,892
Mr. Im Woo Il.

1469
00:41:24,022 --> 00:41:25,592
Where did he come from?

1470
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:27,538
He should dance while staying in his area.

1471
00:41:27,562 --> 00:41:29,231
He dances like this to all the songs.

1472
00:41:29,232 --> 00:41:30,761
For now...

1473
00:41:30,762 --> 00:41:31,842
(Woo Il is in a good mood.)

1474
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:33,701
I'm doomed.

1475
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,432
- You didn't know it, did you?
- No.

1476
00:41:35,602 --> 00:41:38,141
This is hard. I thought the title was different.

1477
00:41:38,142 --> 00:41:40,002
- She got "Plot Twist" right.
- "Plot Twist?"

1478
00:41:40,072 --> 00:41:42,712
They have a big hole in their team.

1479
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,011
We have a sinkhole.

1480
00:41:44,012 --> 00:41:46,581
- Dex is worse than I thought.
- Did you know the answer?

1481
00:41:46,582 --> 00:41:49,451
The problem is that these two haven't even opened their mouth.

1482
00:41:49,452 --> 00:41:51,551
If I dare to make a prediction,

1483
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,112
it'll be a fight between me and Woo Il.

1484
00:41:53,382 --> 00:41:54,862
- That sounds good.
- Against Woo Il.

1485
00:41:55,022 --> 00:41:56,022
(Han Na is also anxious.)

1486
00:41:56,023 --> 00:41:57,352
Goodness, this is hard.

1487
00:41:57,452 --> 00:41:59,852
All I've done is work out. I don't know anything about this.

1488
00:42:00,122 --> 00:42:02,062
- Right.
- Play music.

1489
00:42:03,262 --> 00:42:04,402
(SHUHUA)

1490
00:42:05,362 --> 00:42:06,502
SHUHUA!

1491
00:42:06,662 --> 00:42:09,572
- SHUHUA!
- You should answer this one.

1492
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:11,002
What is it?

1493
00:42:11,102 --> 00:42:12,942
"Rollin'" by Brave Girls.

1494
00:42:12,972 --> 00:42:15,471
(Roll it)

1495
00:42:15,472 --> 00:42:17,211
- Let's go.
- Director, play music.

1496
00:42:17,212 --> 00:42:19,081
- Right, in the military.
- Correct.

1497
00:42:19,082 --> 00:42:20,851
- In the military.
- It was popular in the military.

1498
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:21,911
(It used to be a very popular song in the military.)

1499
00:42:21,912 --> 00:42:22,952
Okay.

1500
00:42:24,152 --> 00:42:25,221
(Salute)

1501
00:42:25,222 --> 00:42:26,222
(Salute)

1502
00:42:26,223 --> 00:42:27,821
(Shaking)

1503
00:42:27,822 --> 00:42:29,952
(Shaking)

1504
00:42:31,122 --> 00:42:32,162
- Okay.
- That was good.

1505
00:42:32,322 --> 00:42:34,661
(He appears a little too late.)

1506
00:42:34,662 --> 00:42:35,792
We'll add the music later.

1507
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:38,632
(Embarrassed)

1508
00:42:38,633 --> 00:42:39,702
Seriously.

1509
00:42:39,802 --> 00:42:41,701
- We have only one chance.
- Good job.

1510
00:42:41,702 --> 00:42:43,171
(Sinkhole Dex succeeds.)

1511
00:42:43,172 --> 00:42:44,971
Dex is so funny. The military...

1512
00:42:44,972 --> 00:42:47,532
- He knows because he was a soldier.
- When he heard the song...

1513
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:49,072
Salute!

1514
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:51,941
- All right.
- Dex being funny seems...

1515
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:53,581
- to make Jong Min nervous.
- You've got this.

1516
00:42:53,582 --> 00:42:55,311
(I should be the one to make people laugh.)

1517
00:42:55,312 --> 00:42:56,681
Jong Min might cancel his honeymoon trip.

1518
00:42:56,682 --> 00:42:58,421
I saw Jong Min acting nervous behind us...

1519
00:42:58,422 --> 00:42:59,982
as Dex made us all laugh.

1520
00:43:00,252 --> 00:43:02,551
- Really?
- Dex was really funny, indeed.

1521
00:43:02,552 --> 00:43:04,391
Canceling his honeymoon might not be enough to keep his position here.

1522
00:43:04,392 --> 00:43:06,161
- Let's move on now.
- He said, "Why is he so good?"

1523
00:43:06,162 --> 00:43:08,362
- I just got really excited.
- Play the song.

1524
00:43:09,132 --> 00:43:10,162
- Okay.
- SHUHUA!

1525
00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:12,462
- I just got really excited.
- Play the song.

1526
00:43:13,532 --> 00:43:14,602
- Okay.
- SHUHUA!

1527
00:43:14,872 --> 00:43:15,931
- This is it.
- We know the answer...

1528
00:43:15,932 --> 00:43:17,531
- What should we do?
- Please give her just one chance.

1529
00:43:17,532 --> 00:43:18,601
- Isn't it that song?
- But we shouted first.

1530
00:43:18,602 --> 00:43:20,641
- Say the answer right now.
- Can I listen a little bit more?

1531
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,148
- No, you can't listen more.
- It's game over.

1532
00:43:22,172 --> 00:43:24,281
- Shall we give the lady a chance?
- Can I please listen a little more?

1533
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:26,011
- Okay. We'll give her a chance.
- Han Na should say the answer.

1534
00:43:26,012 --> 00:43:27,081
- I'll let Han Na answer...
- Han Na gets a chance.

1535
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:28,388
- without listening more.
- Okay.

1536
00:43:28,412 --> 00:43:30,151
(Singing)

1537
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:31,628
- Twenty - Oh, she didn't know the answer.

1538
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:32,922
(No cheating)

1539
00:43:33,122 --> 00:43:34,991
- Who taught you to do such a thing?
- I was just...

1540
00:43:34,992 --> 00:43:36,522
talking about 2NE1.

1541
00:43:37,722 --> 00:43:40,062
- What song is this?
- Relax. You know the song.

1542
00:43:41,492 --> 00:43:42,991
(Twenty)

1543
00:43:42,992 --> 00:43:45,302
("That That" by PSY, released in 2022)

1544
00:43:46,762 --> 00:43:51,072
(The dance song with a flashy group dance)

1545
00:43:52,742 --> 00:43:53,772
Is it PSY's song?

1546
00:43:54,002 --> 00:43:55,872
Come on. Think a little bit harder.

1547
00:43:55,972 --> 00:43:57,641
- Can I tell her how many syllables?
- Is there no time limit?

1548
00:43:57,642 --> 00:44:00,041
- Wasn't I generous enough?
- Just the number of syllables.

1549
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:01,081
- You have three seconds left.
- We gave you enough time.

1550
00:44:01,082 --> 00:44:02,311
- That was enough.
- How many syllables are there?

1551
00:44:02,312 --> 00:44:03,881
- Two syllables.
- Two?

1552
00:44:03,882 --> 00:44:04,982
It's "Mapado."

1553
00:44:05,552 --> 00:44:06,751
- I don't know.
- HANHAE, say the answer.

1554
00:44:06,752 --> 00:44:08,751
- I think I gave her enough time.
- Okay. Let's go.

1555
00:44:08,752 --> 00:44:10,151
- We were polite.
- Team SHUHUA.

1556
00:44:10,152 --> 00:44:11,291
- Let's go and eat.
- Okay.

1557
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:12,592
"That That" by PSY.

1558
00:44:13,222 --> 00:44:14,332
Correct!

1559
00:44:14,962 --> 00:44:18,402
("That That" by PSY)

1560
00:44:19,002 --> 00:44:20,601
(Oh, no)

1561
00:44:20,602 --> 00:44:21,602
Left and right.

1562
00:44:21,603 --> 00:44:24,371
(Shake it, to the left, to the right, then up)

1563
00:44:24,372 --> 00:44:26,072
(And then down)

1564
00:44:29,572 --> 00:44:30,871
(Fantastic group dance)

1565
00:44:30,872 --> 00:44:32,442
What's going on?

1566
00:44:32,782 --> 00:44:34,552
- They're going to eat the food.
- What?

1567
00:44:34,912 --> 00:44:36,781
(He's in a bad mood, but he wants to dance.)

1568
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:38,581
(Their finale performance is crazy good.)

1569
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:39,681
- Now, everyone.
- Okay!

1570
00:44:39,682 --> 00:44:42,091
I'll announce the final result of the game.

1571
00:44:42,092 --> 00:44:43,291
- We won.
- Right, we won.

1572
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:44,321
I can't believe we won this.

1573
00:44:44,322 --> 00:44:47,321
With a score of 200 to 100, Team SHUHUA won.

1574
00:44:47,322 --> 00:44:49,991
(Team SHUHUA won the Dinner Game.)

1575
00:44:49,992 --> 00:44:52,031
- Go, Team SHUHUA!
- We are...

1576
00:44:52,032 --> 00:44:54,131
- SHUHUA-I-DLE!
- I-DLE!

1577
00:44:54,132 --> 00:44:55,532
Now, let's move...

1578
00:44:55,602 --> 00:44:58,541
- so that you can eat comfortably.
- I can't believe we made it.

1579
00:44:58,542 --> 00:44:59,542
- Okay!
- Okay.

1580
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:01,942
- Let's get going.
- I feel bad for Han Na, though.

1581
00:45:02,012 --> 00:45:04,582
- What's wrong with you? Come on.
- What do you mean?

1582
00:45:05,982 --> 00:45:07,742
- What's wrong with you?
- What do you mean?

1583
00:45:07,882 --> 00:45:10,451
Why didn't you do something to make people laugh?

1584
00:45:10,452 --> 00:45:11,881
What do you mean? It was about guessing the answers.

1585
00:45:11,882 --> 00:45:13,181
You should've gotten the right answer!

1586
00:45:13,182 --> 00:45:14,421
- I did!
- Come on!

1587
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:15,491
- I did the best job of all.
- What's wrong with you?

1588
00:45:15,492 --> 00:45:16,551
- Hey!
- What's your problem?

1589
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:17,591
(They even start tussling?)

1590
00:45:17,592 --> 00:45:19,761
- What's going on?
- Hey!

1591
00:45:19,762 --> 00:45:21,191
(Singing)

1592
00:45:21,192 --> 00:45:22,961
(Singing)

1593
00:45:22,962 --> 00:45:25,032
Didn't you do this on "Three Wheels?" I saw it.

1594
00:45:25,062 --> 00:45:26,542
I saw you doing it on "Three Wheels."

1595
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:27,731
I enjoyed watching it.

1596
00:45:27,732 --> 00:45:29,708
(They planned it so quickly. Nobody can stop ChoNam Zone.)

1597
00:45:29,732 --> 00:45:31,201
(The dopamine boosting Dinner Game has ended.)

1598
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:33,442
- Oh, this is the cafeteria.
- Of course, I want to eat.

1599
00:45:33,472 --> 00:45:34,911
- Are we playing another game?
- No, we won't.

1600
00:45:34,912 --> 00:45:35,941
Oh, I see.

1601
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:38,081
But we can get something to eat, can't we?

1602
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:39,142
It will be delicious.

1603
00:45:39,242 --> 00:45:40,611
I don't think you'll eat anything.

1604
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,612
- Really?
- Yes.

1605
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,881
- But... Really?
- I didn't like it before.

1606
00:45:42,882 --> 00:45:44,821
- Do you want to eat?
- I'm jealous.

1607
00:45:44,822 --> 00:45:47,381
What a shame. Han Na met the wrong team.

1608
00:45:47,382 --> 00:45:49,291
It was going well in the beginning.

1609
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:50,891
- Exactly.
- Then we flopped suddenly.

1610
00:45:50,892 --> 00:45:53,421
I don't think it's that she met the wrong team.

1611
00:45:53,422 --> 00:45:55,308
I think it's that we were unlucky to have her on our team.

1612
00:45:55,332 --> 00:45:58,462
(Han Na is taken aback.)

1613
00:45:58,502 --> 00:46:00,732
- Come on. That's mean.
- Right, that's mean.

1614
00:46:01,232 --> 00:46:04,032
- I mean...
- What would that make Joon?

1615
00:46:04,372 --> 00:46:05,572
Let's break up now.

1616
00:46:06,302 --> 00:46:09,312
I wish I could give her food because of her retro dance.

1617
00:46:09,842 --> 00:46:12,041
What a shame. I'm sad.

1618
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:13,042
(She passionately performed the retro dance, shaking her body.)

1619
00:46:13,043 --> 00:46:14,452
We'll bring in the food now.

1620
00:46:15,082 --> 00:46:16,151
Is our food coming?

1621
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:18,422
I'm jealous. This is driving me crazy.

1622
00:46:18,522 --> 00:46:20,351
We've been eating a lot of food today.

1623
00:46:20,352 --> 00:46:22,592
(The losing team members are simply jealous.)

1624
00:46:22,892 --> 00:46:24,421
- It smells delicious.
- Here's your food.

1625
00:46:24,422 --> 00:46:25,561
What is this?

1626
00:46:25,562 --> 00:46:27,322
- Is all of that ours?
- Yes.

1627
00:46:27,762 --> 00:46:29,291
- Oh, look at the ramyeon. Oh, my.
- Oh, the ramyeon looks good.

1628
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:30,861
Tteokbokki, deep-fried food, and sundae.

1629
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:32,822
(Tteokbokki, deep-fried food, sundae, budae stew)

1630
00:46:34,232 --> 00:46:35,431
(All the dishes they want are here.)

1631
00:46:35,432 --> 00:46:36,831
(There's dessert too.)

1632
00:46:36,832 --> 00:46:38,671
Here are jokbal and bossam.

1633
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:40,772
Jokbal and bossam.

1634
00:46:40,942 --> 00:46:43,071
We also have vegetables to make vegetable wraps.

1635
00:46:43,072 --> 00:46:44,541
- I'll try this.
- Okay. Try the noodles.

1636
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:45,941
- Make them look good.
- I'll do that.

1637
00:46:45,942 --> 00:46:47,281
- Make a facial expression...
- Make it look delicious.

1638
00:46:47,282 --> 00:46:49,282
Of excitement. That's good.

1639
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:51,451
Here are bossam kimchi and some other side dishes.

1640
00:46:51,452 --> 00:46:53,421
- My, look at the braised beef ribs.
- Oh, my.

1641
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:55,151
- Here's braised beef ribs.
- It's steamy.

1642
00:46:55,152 --> 00:46:56,152
Steam is rising.

1643
00:46:56,153 --> 00:46:58,068
- My, that looks tasty.
- Okay. I've filmed this too.

1644
00:46:58,092 --> 00:46:59,161
- It looks delicious.
- Because I want to do it.

1645
00:46:59,162 --> 00:47:01,592
All of those are dishes that smell good.

1646
00:47:01,692 --> 00:47:03,931
I feel so bad, though.

1647
00:47:03,932 --> 00:47:06,431
- I feel bad.
- The members of Team SHUHUA...

1648
00:47:06,432 --> 00:47:07,831
can start enjoying the food now.

1649
00:47:07,832 --> 00:47:10,071
- SHUHUA, thank you. Team SHUHUA.
- Thank you.

1650
00:47:10,072 --> 00:47:13,641
- Enjoy the food, everyone.
- Enjoy your meal. I'll enjoy it.

1651
00:47:13,642 --> 00:47:15,671
- Thank you. I'll enjoy the food.
- Enjoy your meal, everyone.

1652
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:17,272
We're so lucky today.

1653
00:47:18,312 --> 00:47:21,252
(Putting food into his mouth)

1654
00:47:21,352 --> 00:47:23,011
(Nod of satisfaction)

1655
00:47:23,012 --> 00:47:24,112
Indeed.

1656
00:47:24,252 --> 00:47:26,822
(The youngest member tries the meat as well.)

1657
00:47:27,152 --> 00:47:28,351
(Frown of the truth)

1658
00:47:28,352 --> 00:47:30,268
The delivery food is awesome. Everything is so good.

1659
00:47:30,292 --> 00:47:31,998
- My, look at that.
- This is aglio e olio.

1660
00:47:32,022 --> 00:47:33,421
I've seen it on TV before.

1661
00:47:33,422 --> 00:47:34,492
It looks amazing.

1662
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:35,961
Let's try makguksu too.

1663
00:47:35,962 --> 00:47:38,832
(He puts a piece of jokbal on top of sweet, sour makguksu.)

1664
00:47:39,862 --> 00:47:42,872
(It can't go wrong with jokbal with makguksu.)

1665
00:47:43,272 --> 00:47:44,471
(Enjoying vicariously)

1666
00:47:44,472 --> 00:47:45,571
That must be so amazing.

1667
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:47,912
(Watching him eating right before her eyes)

1668
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:50,712
(He eats a big piece of tofu in one bite.)

1669
00:47:51,312 --> 00:47:53,182
(He eats a big piece of ribs in one bite too.)

1670
00:47:54,142 --> 00:47:56,982
(He gobbles down the food without a break.)

1671
00:47:57,212 --> 00:47:59,221
- Restaurants in Yeouido...
- It's good.

1672
00:47:59,222 --> 00:48:01,521
Restaurants in Yeouido can't survive if they don't make good food.

1673
00:48:01,522 --> 00:48:02,622
I can see that.

1674
00:48:04,052 --> 00:48:05,362
(Gulping)

1675
00:48:06,122 --> 00:48:07,122
(Gulping as well)

1676
00:48:07,123 --> 00:48:08,592
It looks so good.

1677
00:48:09,332 --> 00:48:10,632
It looks really tasty.

1678
00:48:11,332 --> 00:48:13,931
Do we really get no food at all?

1679
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,931
Oh, actually...

1680
00:48:15,932 --> 00:48:17,572
We ordered some food...

1681
00:48:17,902 --> 00:48:19,172
for the losing team as well.

1682
00:48:20,072 --> 00:48:21,411
- Yes! I knew it.
- I knew it.

1683
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:23,171
- We have guests today.
- Right.

1684
00:48:23,172 --> 00:48:24,681
We have a chance to eat some food. Hey, what's that?

1685
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:26,781
- It must be some kind of noodles.
- Thank you.

1686
00:48:26,782 --> 00:48:28,081
- This is not bad.
- Oh, what?

1687
00:48:28,082 --> 00:48:30,682
- It looks so good. It's nice.
- This is not bad at all.

1688
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,551
- What is it?
- This is not bad.

1689
00:48:32,552 --> 00:48:33,752
- It's nice.
- What is it?

1690
00:48:34,322 --> 00:48:35,322
- What is it?
- This is not bad at all.

1691
00:48:35,323 --> 00:48:36,998
(The winning team members are curious too.)

1692
00:48:37,022 --> 00:48:38,521
- It's fish roe rice balls.
- It's nice.

1693
00:48:38,522 --> 00:48:39,692
It's nice.

1694
00:48:40,092 --> 00:48:42,361
- It's so nice.
- I'm very grateful.

1695
00:48:42,362 --> 00:48:44,561
- It's really nutty and tasty.
- Indeed.

1696
00:48:44,562 --> 00:48:47,531
Han Na, I see that you're not picky with food at all.

1697
00:48:47,532 --> 00:48:49,201
What's wrong with this? It's a very tasty dish.

1698
00:48:49,202 --> 00:48:50,332
(Laughing)

1699
00:48:50,402 --> 00:48:52,602
- Han Na seems very optimistic.
- Indeed.

1700
00:48:52,742 --> 00:48:55,271
- Mayonnaise is added too.
- Really? I'm surprised.

1701
00:48:55,272 --> 00:48:56,542
Don't you want to try it?

1702
00:48:57,572 --> 00:48:58,781
Do you want to exchange yours for this?

1703
00:48:58,782 --> 00:49:00,511
Now that I heard you say that, I suddenly want to eat it.

1704
00:49:00,512 --> 00:49:02,051
- It looks so savory.
- It's good.

1705
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:03,181
(There's 1 person who has already been tempted.)

1706
00:49:03,182 --> 00:49:04,182
It's different.

1707
00:49:04,183 --> 00:49:07,081
It actually goes well with jokbal.

1708
00:49:07,082 --> 00:49:08,291
(Rice balls and jokbal make a sure-fire combination.)

1709
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:09,452
It's awesome.

1710
00:49:11,892 --> 00:49:12,961
My, it's good.

1711
00:49:12,962 --> 00:49:13,962
(Yes, this is what I'm talking about.)

1712
00:49:13,963 --> 00:49:15,162
Oh, good. This is tasty.

1713
00:49:15,262 --> 00:49:16,492
- It's sweet.
- Indeed.

1714
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:20,162
(He has a big spoonful of it.)

1715
00:49:21,802 --> 00:49:22,932
This is more than enough.

1716
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,331
(It's nutty and savory.)

1717
00:49:24,332 --> 00:49:25,472
It's so nutty and savory.

1718
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:27,541
It's nutty because it has sesame oil, right?

1719
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:28,741
It's good.

1720
00:49:28,742 --> 00:49:30,972
(He has a bite of a triangular rice ball.)

1721
00:49:32,782 --> 00:49:33,942
- My, it's so good.
- Indeed.

1722
00:49:34,212 --> 00:49:35,282
It's amazing.

1723
00:49:35,912 --> 00:49:37,582
- It's good.
- It has pickled radish too.

1724
00:49:38,182 --> 00:49:39,752
- So it has a crunchy texture.
- Right.

1725
00:49:39,982 --> 00:49:41,551
- The fish roes pop in my mouth.
- It's sweet, indeed.

1726
00:49:41,552 --> 00:49:43,152
It goes well with tteokbokki as well.

1727
00:49:43,722 --> 00:49:46,162
I wish I had a piece of ribs on top of it.

1728
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:47,791
It'd be so tasty.

1729
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:50,592
Since the members' friends came for this special episode,

1730
00:49:50,632 --> 00:49:51,731
(Perking up her ears)

1731
00:49:51,732 --> 00:49:54,261
- we'll give you a chance.
- Thank you.

1732
00:49:54,262 --> 00:49:55,348
- Right. Give us a chance.
- I told you so.

1733
00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:56,771
That's humane of them.

1734
00:49:56,772 --> 00:49:58,871
Then we'll begin the relief mission.

1735
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:00,241
Yes. Please help us.

1736
00:50:00,242 --> 00:50:01,372
Now, please come in.

1737
00:50:01,512 --> 00:50:02,642
- What?
- Who's coming?

1738
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,081
- Who's coming now?
- Who is coming in?

1739
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:06,582
What's going on?

1740
00:50:06,642 --> 00:50:07,842
- Jjajangmyeon?
- No!

1741
00:50:07,882 --> 00:50:09,182
Oh, they ordered jjajangmyeon.

1742
00:50:09,852 --> 00:50:12,822
(Let us tell you something about this man.)

1743
00:50:13,322 --> 00:50:18,792
(Byung Jin Mo with a delivery case from Team Preparations is back.)

1744
00:50:18,922 --> 00:50:21,331
He'll open the delivery case for a brief moment.

1745
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:22,332
(Guess the item in the delivery case while he opens and closes it.)

1746
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:24,038
Oh, the game where you open and close the case?

1747
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,902
- Oh, the delivery case game?
- Yes.

1748
00:50:26,132 --> 00:50:27,501
I'm confident that I can see what's inside.

1749
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:28,502
I'm good at seeing moving objects.

1750
00:50:28,503 --> 00:50:30,931
Three of you who guess the object inside the delivery case...

1751
00:50:30,932 --> 00:50:33,271
will get to join the winning team and eat the food with them.

1752
00:50:33,272 --> 00:50:34,392
We'll get to eat their food?

1753
00:50:36,212 --> 00:50:38,281
- Three of us?
- HANHAE said...

1754
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:40,581
that he wanted to try rice balls.

1755
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:42,481
So the winning team members get rice balls...

1756
00:50:42,482 --> 00:50:44,381
- if they get the right answer.
- You should play the game.

1757
00:50:44,382 --> 00:50:45,522
Join in the game.

1758
00:50:46,122 --> 00:50:47,681
I want to try some rice balls too.

1759
00:50:47,682 --> 00:50:49,202
Even you will play the game too? Gosh.

1760
00:50:49,252 --> 00:50:50,532
What? Are all of you playing it?

1761
00:50:50,852 --> 00:50:52,362
- Why are you all coming?
- No.

1762
00:50:52,722 --> 00:50:54,291
- Really?
- Gosh, seriously.

1763
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:55,791
- But...
- I've always wanted to play this.

1764
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:57,152
SHUHUA wants to play the game too.

1765
00:50:57,732 --> 00:50:59,432
- Let's begin.
- Why did he lift it up?

1766
00:50:59,832 --> 00:51:00,931
You should see it closely.

1767
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:01,932
(Focused)

1768
00:51:03,232 --> 00:51:04,571
- He'll do it without the cover?
- What?

1769
00:51:04,572 --> 00:51:05,572
(Byung Jin Mo removes the cover first.)

1770
00:51:05,573 --> 00:51:06,602
- What?
- Hold on.

1771
00:51:07,742 --> 00:51:08,742
(Extremely focused)

1772
00:51:08,743 --> 00:51:10,211
- What is it?
- What's inside the case?

1773
00:51:10,212 --> 00:51:12,092
- There's nothing inside... Wait.
- Impressive.

1774
00:51:15,452 --> 00:51:16,482
He's improved his skills.

1775
00:51:16,512 --> 00:51:18,782
- What is it?
- I can't see it at all.

1776
00:51:19,282 --> 00:51:20,381
- What is it?
- He's got a new skill now.

1777
00:51:20,382 --> 00:51:22,792
(He showcases even more advanced skills.)

1778
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:28,532
(What is that?)

1779
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:30,161
I just saw it.

1780
00:51:30,162 --> 00:51:31,922
- I saw something green.
- What is it? Wait.

1781
00:51:32,232 --> 00:51:33,701
(Did you see it too?)

1782
00:51:33,702 --> 00:51:35,662
- I saw something green.
- I can't see it at all.

1783
00:51:36,402 --> 00:51:38,118
- I can only see the color.
- Jong Min! Exfoliating towel!

1784
00:51:38,142 --> 00:51:40,101
- Jong Min! Exfoliating towel!
- My gosh. That's amazing.

1785
00:51:40,102 --> 00:51:41,742
- Incorrect.
- Dex! Lettuce!

1786
00:51:41,772 --> 00:51:43,542
- Incorrect.
- Joon. Bottle opener.

1787
00:51:43,712 --> 00:51:44,712
- Incorrect.
- HANHAE!

1788
00:51:44,713 --> 00:51:46,411
- Sae Ho!
- Woo Il!

1789
00:51:46,412 --> 00:51:48,481
Sae Ho! Correction tape!

1790
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:50,551
- The one that's used on paper.
- Jong Min! Adhesive tape!

1791
00:51:50,552 --> 00:51:51,881
- HANHAE!
- Woo Il!

1792
00:51:51,882 --> 00:51:53,321
- Whiteboard marker!
- Adhesive tape.

1793
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:54,482
- Sae Ho got it right.
- Yes!

1794
00:51:54,752 --> 00:51:56,421
- What is it?
- It's a correction tape.

1795
00:51:56,422 --> 00:51:57,851
It's a correction tape.

1796
00:51:57,852 --> 00:51:59,162
(Correction tape)

1797
00:51:59,222 --> 00:52:00,861
Byung Jin Mo is so awesome.

1798
00:52:00,862 --> 00:52:01,891
(Giving him a standing ovation)

1799
00:52:01,892 --> 00:52:04,412
- How did he see that? My gosh.
- How can we know what that is?

1800
00:52:04,462 --> 00:52:06,301
My gosh. He's really fast.

1801
00:52:06,302 --> 00:52:09,131
- Sae Ho, you can start eating now.
- He spins it and...

1802
00:52:09,132 --> 00:52:10,132
- Yes.
- Oh, I see.

1803
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:11,942
He's like a bullfighter.

1804
00:52:12,442 --> 00:52:14,141
Isn't he great at it?

1805
00:52:14,142 --> 00:52:16,711
I'm sorry to interrupt, but Han Na is crossing the line.

1806
00:52:16,712 --> 00:52:17,911
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

1807
00:52:17,912 --> 00:52:19,541
- Come on, Woo Il.
- Why? It's the truth.

1808
00:52:19,542 --> 00:52:22,281
- Don't be so strict.
- This is an individual game.

1809
00:52:22,282 --> 00:52:23,811
- She crossed the line too far.
- Right. Okay.

1810
00:52:23,812 --> 00:52:24,821
(Woo Il became very strict since the food is on the line.)

1811
00:52:24,822 --> 00:52:26,922
We'll begin now. Byung Jin, ready. Go.

1812
00:52:26,982 --> 00:52:28,022
Let's go.

1813
00:52:30,592 --> 00:52:31,592
(Spinning)

1814
00:52:31,593 --> 00:52:32,862
- What is it?
- What is it?

1815
00:52:34,932 --> 00:52:35,932
What is it?

1816
00:52:36,492 --> 00:52:37,962
- What is it?
- Oh, I know. Han Na.

1817
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:39,831
- Potato?
- Incorrect.

1818
00:52:39,832 --> 00:52:41,232
- Chang Hee.
- Go ahead.

1819
00:52:41,572 --> 00:52:42,731
- Bread.
- Incorrect.

1820
00:52:42,732 --> 00:52:43,871
- Han Na.
- Jong Min!

1821
00:52:43,872 --> 00:52:45,101
- SHUHUA.
- Han Na, you have another chance.

1822
00:52:45,102 --> 00:52:46,402
Han Na. Gold kiwi.

1823
00:52:47,442 --> 00:52:49,311
I was going to say that!

1824
00:52:49,312 --> 00:52:51,542
- Was that a gold kiwi?
- HANHAE. Green kiwi?

1825
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:54,241
- You punk!
- Jong Min. It's a regular kiwi.

1826
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:56,082
Woo Il. It's a delicious kiwi.

1827
00:52:56,712 --> 00:52:57,751
Han Na got the answer.

1828
00:52:57,752 --> 00:52:59,498
(Han Na got the answer as she said it first.)

1829
00:52:59,522 --> 00:53:01,352
- Goodness, so it was a kiwi.
- Yes!

1830
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:04,268
I can't even tell that it's a kiwi even after seeing it.

1831
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:06,021
I can't tell that it's a kiwi from here.

1832
00:53:06,022 --> 00:53:08,182
- I thought it was mochi.
- I thought it was a potato.

1833
00:53:08,232 --> 00:53:09,832
My goodness, this is crazy.

1834
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,462
This game is fun.

1835
00:53:13,132 --> 00:53:15,031
- Enjoy your meal. Take it slowly.
- It's delicious.

1836
00:53:15,032 --> 00:53:16,501
I'm kind of relieved now.

1837
00:53:16,502 --> 00:53:18,441
(Taking a big bite)

1838
00:53:18,442 --> 00:53:20,942
- This will be your last chance.
- It's the last one.

1839
00:53:21,342 --> 00:53:23,142
- Here's your last chance.
- He's practicing.

1840
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:25,041
(Glancing)

1841
00:53:25,042 --> 00:53:26,512
I want to try spinning it too.

1842
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,811
Han Na says that she wants to spin the delivery case.

1843
00:53:28,812 --> 00:53:30,681
- Like the Tecktonik dance.
- Right.

1844
00:53:30,682 --> 00:53:33,522
- I mean...
- How about Han Na spinning it?

1845
00:53:33,722 --> 00:53:35,322
Should I spin the delivery case?

1846
00:53:35,422 --> 00:53:36,622
Like a bonus round.

1847
00:53:37,392 --> 00:53:38,661
He's giving it to her.

1848
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:39,991
(Taking over the delivery case job from Byung Jin Mo)

1849
00:53:39,992 --> 00:53:41,121
- All right.
- Goodness.

1850
00:53:41,122 --> 00:53:43,962
We will see the thing inside since it's facing front.

1851
00:53:44,832 --> 00:53:45,862
Try it.

1852
00:53:47,262 --> 00:53:49,272
(Showing very little)

1853
00:53:49,902 --> 00:53:50,931
(Come on, Han Na. That's not right.)

1854
00:53:50,932 --> 00:53:52,371
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

1855
00:53:52,372 --> 00:53:53,501
- Come on, be serious.
- Do it properly.

1856
00:53:53,502 --> 00:53:55,012
(How about this?)

1857
00:53:55,372 --> 00:53:57,372
(She's good.)

1858
00:53:58,812 --> 00:54:01,241
(Daring)

1859
00:54:01,242 --> 00:54:02,451
(A daring performance)

1860
00:54:02,452 --> 00:54:03,612
What was that?

1861
00:54:04,152 --> 00:54:06,051
(Guess what's inside...)

1862
00:54:06,052 --> 00:54:07,952
(the delivery case.)

1863
00:54:08,522 --> 00:54:09,652
Hold on a second.

1864
00:54:09,952 --> 00:54:10,952
(Even the one with experience is flustered.)

1865
00:54:10,953 --> 00:54:12,291
What was that?

1866
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:15,392
(An extraordinary master is here.)

1867
00:54:20,402 --> 00:54:21,902
- Hold on.
- What's inside?

1868
00:54:22,632 --> 00:54:23,972
(Peek-a-boo)

1869
00:54:25,342 --> 00:54:26,502
What's that?

1870
00:54:27,272 --> 00:54:29,672
- I got it.
- Her eyes look weird.

1871
00:54:29,772 --> 00:54:31,271
- Her eyes are weird.
- She's flipping her eyes.

1872
00:54:31,272 --> 00:54:33,911
- Her eyes have gone crazy.
- Right.

1873
00:54:33,912 --> 00:54:34,912
(What's wrong with my eyes?)

1874
00:54:34,913 --> 00:54:36,211
- She's good.
- She's good.

1875
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:37,752
It's here.

1876
00:54:37,852 --> 00:54:38,951
It's here.

1877
00:54:38,952 --> 00:54:40,481
(Her moves became even more daring.)

1878
00:54:40,482 --> 00:54:41,482
I got it!

1879
00:54:41,652 --> 00:54:42,722
It's here.

1880
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:46,092
- I got it!
- Jong Min.

1881
00:54:48,092 --> 00:54:49,231
Jong Min.

1882
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:50,932
- It's a syringe.
- Incorrect.

1883
00:54:51,262 --> 00:54:52,431
It's not a syringe.

1884
00:54:52,432 --> 00:54:53,861
Lee Joon. A nail clipper?

1885
00:54:53,862 --> 00:54:54,862
Incorrect.

1886
00:54:56,402 --> 00:54:57,701
- It's driving me crazy.
- Oh, that was nice.

1887
00:54:57,702 --> 00:55:00,172
- What's with her?
- What is this?

1888
00:55:01,472 --> 00:55:02,712
- I see it.
- What is it?

1889
00:55:03,742 --> 00:55:05,112
- What is it?
- What can it be?

1890
00:55:06,742 --> 00:55:08,141
Hold on. What is it?

1891
00:55:08,142 --> 00:55:09,182
What is it?

1892
00:55:10,052 --> 00:55:12,422
(You can't take a guess when I'm showing you this much?)

1893
00:55:13,152 --> 00:55:16,522
(Han Na becoming one with the delivery case)

1894
00:55:17,092 --> 00:55:19,422
(Everyone is impressed.)

1895
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:23,832
(Did you guess it?)

1896
00:55:25,362 --> 00:55:27,261
(The answer is eye drops.)

1897
00:55:27,262 --> 00:55:28,802
- Chang Hee.
- What is it?

1898
00:55:29,172 --> 00:55:30,771
- She's holding it like this.
- You should get it by now.

1899
00:55:30,772 --> 00:55:32,301
- Chang Hee.
- What is it?

1900
00:55:32,302 --> 00:55:33,441
A disposable spoon.

1901
00:55:33,442 --> 00:55:34,572
- Really?
- Incorrect.

1902
00:55:34,842 --> 00:55:36,911
- You're almost there.
- It's so close.

1903
00:55:36,912 --> 00:55:38,881
- I got it! Jong Min.
- What is it?

1904
00:55:38,882 --> 00:55:40,212
- A plaster.
- Incorrect.

1905
00:55:40,842 --> 00:55:42,781
I got it. Lee Joon.

1906
00:55:42,782 --> 00:55:43,911
A cotton swab.

1907
00:55:43,912 --> 00:55:44,912
- It's not.
- It's not?

1908
00:55:44,913 --> 00:55:46,652
Chang Hee. Eye drops!

1909
00:55:47,882 --> 00:55:49,592
- Correct.
- Yes!

1910
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:51,722
Correct!

1911
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:55,492
She was amazing.

1912
00:55:55,832 --> 00:55:56,891
- Han Na.
- Goodness.

1913
00:55:56,892 --> 00:55:58,562
She's really good.

1914
00:55:59,462 --> 00:56:01,701
Are you okay? You're back alive.

1915
00:56:01,702 --> 00:56:03,302
- This is exhausting.
- Do we have more?

1916
00:56:04,802 --> 00:56:05,941
(The last 3 people who couldn't get the answers)

1917
00:56:05,942 --> 00:56:07,202
My gosh, Woo Il.

1918
00:56:07,302 --> 00:56:08,742
I thought he would get one right.

1919
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:09,871
How about...

1920
00:56:09,872 --> 00:56:12,012
- Do we have more?
- How about we...

1921
00:56:12,112 --> 00:56:13,881
(You mean more questions with the delivery case?)

1922
00:56:13,882 --> 00:56:15,751
- SHUHUA, go ahead.
- Go on.

1923
00:56:15,752 --> 00:56:17,782
- Okay.
- All right.

1924
00:56:17,882 --> 00:56:19,522
- Will you be okay?
- I'll give it a try.

1925
00:56:20,022 --> 00:56:21,621
This is your final round.

1926
00:56:21,622 --> 00:56:23,821
- This is the last one.
- Okay, we did it too many times.

1927
00:56:23,822 --> 00:56:25,162
Whoever gets the answer,

1928
00:56:25,492 --> 00:56:27,422
we'll give you 45 seconds to eat.

1929
00:56:27,922 --> 00:56:29,631
I'm sorry. We're closed.

1930
00:56:29,632 --> 00:56:31,091
- This is the last round.
- I mean, 45 seconds should be okay.

1931
00:56:31,092 --> 00:56:33,361
- We can take three bites.
- This will be our last round.

1932
00:56:33,362 --> 00:56:35,772
I can't wait to see the last one.

1933
00:56:36,932 --> 00:56:39,171
Just put whatever you have. Put something big.

1934
00:56:39,172 --> 00:56:41,542
- All right.
- Let's start. Watch carefully.

1935
00:56:42,112 --> 00:56:43,972
- SHUHUA.
- Show it once and for all.

1936
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:45,582
Be bold.

1937
00:56:46,182 --> 00:56:47,182
Be bold.

1938
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:49,251
(She's good.)

1939
00:56:49,252 --> 00:56:50,732
- She's bold from the start.
- Again.

1940
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:52,822
(They saw...)

1941
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:53,982
(something inside the case.)

1942
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:57,252
- Woo Il. A highlighter.
- It's purple.

1943
00:56:57,492 --> 00:56:58,761
- Incorrect.
- That's not the answer.

1944
00:56:58,762 --> 00:57:00,962
Jong Min. A lighter.

1945
00:57:01,162 --> 00:57:02,291
- Incorrect.
- No?

1946
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:03,892
- It's yellow.
- Is it yellow?

1947
00:57:05,662 --> 00:57:07,902
(A windmill performance with the delivery case)

1948
00:57:08,702 --> 00:57:10,231
(Fancy spinning)

1949
00:57:10,232 --> 00:57:11,432
She's flexible.

1950
00:57:11,572 --> 00:57:12,601
What?

1951
00:57:12,602 --> 00:57:13,671
(Flexible idol-like moves)

1952
00:57:13,672 --> 00:57:14,772
Goodness, that's amazing.

1953
00:57:16,912 --> 00:57:17,971
What is that?

1954
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:20,111
(Bold walking)

1955
00:57:20,112 --> 00:57:21,112
(Bold skills)

1956
00:57:22,652 --> 00:57:23,852
(That was incredible!)

1957
00:57:23,882 --> 00:57:25,252
She's good.

1958
00:57:25,582 --> 00:57:26,682
Check it out one more time.

1959
00:57:26,982 --> 00:57:28,082
What is it?

1960
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:29,851
- What is it?
- Lee Joon.

1961
00:57:29,852 --> 00:57:31,821
Jong Min! I got it.

1962
00:57:31,822 --> 00:57:33,392
- Jong Min.
- What on earth is it?

1963
00:57:33,462 --> 00:57:34,861
I still don't know what it is.

1964
00:57:34,862 --> 00:57:36,262
I know what it is.

1965
00:57:36,292 --> 00:57:38,932
- Joon said it first.
- Joon has the chance.

1966
00:57:39,532 --> 00:57:41,062
(Please don't get it right.)

1967
00:57:41,562 --> 00:57:42,672
A math compass.

1968
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:45,372
That is correct.

1969
00:57:47,242 --> 00:57:49,112
(My goodness, Jong Min.)

1970
00:57:49,912 --> 00:57:51,542
(I almost had it.)

1971
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:52,642
Correct.

1972
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:54,011
(Lee Joon got the answer.)

1973
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,312
Lee Joon!

1974
00:57:56,282 --> 00:57:58,082
A math compass. Right.

1975
00:57:58,352 --> 00:57:59,421
It's a math compass.

1976
00:57:59,422 --> 00:58:00,551
I saw it at the end.

1977
00:58:00,552 --> 00:58:01,852
It was a bit tough.

1978
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:04,751
- Well done.
- Good job.

1979
00:58:04,752 --> 00:58:05,762
All right.

1980
00:58:05,862 --> 00:58:08,321
Guys, please wrap up with your meals.

1981
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:10,191
- I can eat!
- Come on.

1982
00:58:10,192 --> 00:58:11,631
- Hurry up.
- What? Which one should I eat?

1983
00:58:11,632 --> 00:58:13,131
- He doesn't have time.
- I don't have much time.

1984
00:58:13,132 --> 00:58:15,301
(He has 45 seconds to eat.)

1985
00:58:15,302 --> 00:58:16,331
He has no time.

1986
00:58:16,332 --> 00:58:17,801
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

1987
00:58:17,802 --> 00:58:21,542
(Inhaling food like crazy)

1988
00:58:21,642 --> 00:58:23,642
I can't believe I'm having a day like this.

1989
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,112
- You have 20 seconds.
- Gosh, 20 seconds.

1990
00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:27,812
- Are you counting?
- Yes.

1991
00:58:28,952 --> 00:58:30,752
(The others are also busy with their spoons.)

1992
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:33,921
(Gulping down)

1993
00:58:33,922 --> 00:58:35,252
(Glancing)

1994
00:58:35,592 --> 00:58:37,521
- Poor guys.
- I feel bad for them.

1995
00:58:37,522 --> 00:58:39,402
(The two men from Team Loser having rice balls)

1996
00:58:40,092 --> 00:58:42,491
(Chewing)

1997
00:58:42,492 --> 00:58:45,502
(Chewing)

1998
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:47,702
(Can't take his eyes off the food)

1999
00:58:48,162 --> 00:58:49,801
(Glancing)

2000
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:51,971
Because Joon is rushed, he's stammering.

2001
00:58:51,972 --> 00:58:54,671
(Dex grabbing something)

2002
00:58:54,672 --> 00:58:56,972
(Heading somewhere)

2003
00:58:57,072 --> 00:58:58,981
- No, it's okay.
- This would go well with the balls.

2004
00:58:58,982 --> 00:59:00,782
Gosh, kimchi would be nice.

2005
00:59:01,182 --> 00:59:02,782
Dex is a nice guy.

2006
00:59:03,182 --> 00:59:05,222
He's a nice guy. He treats the elders with respect.

2007
00:59:07,482 --> 00:59:09,691
(What a grateful young man he is.)

2008
00:59:09,692 --> 00:59:11,751
- We'll clean the table now.
- Wait a minute.

2009
00:59:11,752 --> 00:59:13,661
All right. Now...

2010
00:59:13,662 --> 00:59:14,722
You're cleaning up now?

2011
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:16,392
You're really cleaning up?

2012
00:59:16,532 --> 00:59:17,992
Gosh, this is crazy.

2013
00:59:18,032 --> 00:59:19,601
They're taking away everything when they're eating.

2014
00:59:19,602 --> 00:59:20,801
(Trying his best to eat more)

2015
00:59:20,802 --> 00:59:21,832
My goodness.

2016
00:59:22,432 --> 00:59:23,831
I'll hit the slate.

2017
00:59:23,832 --> 00:59:25,341
This is so real.

2018
00:59:25,342 --> 00:59:26,972
One, two, three.

2019
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,012
Unbelievable.

2020
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:30,642
It's unbelievable.

2021
00:59:31,242 --> 00:59:34,141
(The intense dinner time is over.)

2022
00:59:34,142 --> 00:59:35,851
- Gosh, what is this place?
- What is this place?

2023
00:59:35,852 --> 00:59:38,312
It must be a break time.

2024
00:59:38,952 --> 00:59:40,021
What's going on?

2025
00:59:40,022 --> 00:59:42,221
This was our waiting room during the Entertainment Awards.

2026
00:59:42,222 --> 00:59:43,222
(It's a waiting room for performers before going up the stage.)

2027
00:59:43,223 --> 00:59:44,291
It's nice.

2028
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:45,662
Since this is KBS...

2029
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:47,322
Why are we here?

2030
00:59:47,492 --> 00:59:48,592
The seats are...

2031
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:51,661
Let's hear the overall feedback of our show so far.

2032
00:59:51,662 --> 00:59:53,331
Sure, let's ask them.

2033
00:59:53,332 --> 00:59:55,131
I think it's 9 out of 10 so far.

2034
00:59:55,132 --> 00:59:57,831
- Is it out of 10?
- I deducted 1 point...

2035
00:59:57,832 --> 01:00:00,272
because I wanted to come again during the horror specials.

2036
01:00:00,772 --> 01:00:02,312
Are you scared of ghosts?

2037
01:00:02,612 --> 01:00:04,712
I'm not scared of them. But it will be so fun.

2038
01:00:04,912 --> 01:00:07,312
Dex said this earlier.

2039
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,711
Our shoot today has been very smooth.

2040
01:00:09,712 --> 01:00:11,851
- Right.
- He wanted to try the full course.

2041
01:00:11,852 --> 01:00:12,952
Really?

2042
01:00:13,052 --> 01:00:14,181
(A full experience?)

2043
01:00:14,182 --> 01:00:15,821
- Experience it fully?
- Honestly, I think...

2044
01:00:15,822 --> 01:00:17,662
This show is like the UDT version of TV shows.

2045
01:00:17,792 --> 01:00:19,191
You're right.

2046
01:00:19,192 --> 01:00:21,561
Chang Hee had to get the IV drip for eight hours after this show.

2047
01:00:21,562 --> 01:00:22,692
He's right.

2048
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:25,501
I wanted to ask the show's original members.

2049
01:00:25,502 --> 01:00:27,761
How tough is today's shoot compared to the other days?

2050
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:29,831
- Honestly, I'm not exaggerating.
- Right, no exaggeration.

2051
01:00:29,832 --> 01:00:31,132
It's like 3 out of 10.

2052
01:00:31,202 --> 01:00:33,571
- Come on.
- I'm not exaggerating.

2053
01:00:33,572 --> 01:00:34,842
(Shocked)

2054
01:00:35,202 --> 01:00:36,711
- Really?
- Chang Hee, you know.

2055
01:00:36,712 --> 01:00:39,112
I can shoot it for three days at this rate.

2056
01:00:39,142 --> 01:00:41,242
- Really?
- Even 3 days and 2 nights.

2057
01:00:42,012 --> 01:00:43,281
How was today's shoot, Han Na?

2058
01:00:43,282 --> 01:00:46,781
- You've been filming with us.
- You mean so far?

2059
01:00:46,782 --> 01:00:49,192
- How do you like it?
- I like all the games.

2060
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:50,751
- Han Na...
- I think it's fun.

2061
01:00:50,752 --> 01:00:52,522
We can all see that you're enjoying it.

2062
01:00:52,862 --> 01:00:54,021
I'm getting...

2063
01:00:54,022 --> 01:00:55,691
- We can tell that you're enjoying.
- I'm getting more excited.

2064
01:00:55,692 --> 01:00:56,931
I know, you're getting excited.

2065
01:00:56,932 --> 01:00:58,291
She's getting all hyped up.

2066
01:00:58,292 --> 01:01:00,131
What do you usually do at home?

2067
01:01:00,132 --> 01:01:02,331
- She is enjoying it a lot.
- She loved it.

2068
01:01:02,332 --> 01:01:04,001
- I haven't been playing a lot.
- So now...

2069
01:01:04,002 --> 01:01:05,071
It was like we were having fun on our own.

2070
01:01:05,072 --> 01:01:06,341
What's your MBTI type?

2071
01:01:06,342 --> 01:01:08,472
Mine is INFJ-A.

2072
01:01:08,642 --> 01:01:10,441
- What is with the A?
- What's that?

2073
01:01:10,442 --> 01:01:11,571
What's with the A?

2074
01:01:11,572 --> 01:01:13,881
- There are Type A and Type T.
- There is?

2075
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:15,951
Considering she's INFJ,

2076
01:01:15,952 --> 01:01:18,351
she let it all go when she did the dance.

2077
01:01:18,352 --> 01:01:20,081
- Right.
- I was in a trance.

2078
01:01:20,082 --> 01:01:21,122
I loved how I was into it.

2079
01:01:21,422 --> 01:01:23,051
(To an introvert, dancing is only possible...)

2080
01:01:23,052 --> 01:01:25,252
(when she lets it all go.)

2081
01:01:25,562 --> 01:01:27,391
I just went along with it.

2082
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,661
I got immersed.

2083
01:01:28,662 --> 01:01:29,891
- Goodness.
- I was really surprised.

2084
01:01:29,892 --> 01:01:33,161
- I want to know what SHUHUA thinks.
- Me too.

2085
01:01:33,162 --> 01:01:34,561
- Me too.
- She's an idol.

2086
01:01:34,562 --> 01:01:35,931
How do you like the show as an idol?

2087
01:01:35,932 --> 01:01:37,502
How would you rate the show out of ten?

2088
01:01:37,872 --> 01:01:38,972
Be honest.

2089
01:01:39,272 --> 01:01:41,001
Will you come again if I call you next time?

2090
01:01:41,002 --> 01:01:42,842
(Thinking)

2091
01:01:43,012 --> 01:01:44,072
(Thinking)

2092
01:01:44,272 --> 01:01:45,911
(We don't have to hear her anymore.)

2093
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:47,081
Let me tell you why.

2094
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:50,881
This show is too hyped up. When I'm in such a show...

2095
01:01:50,882 --> 01:01:51,982
- Is it too hard?
- Yes.

2096
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:53,652
I want to hide.

2097
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:55,181
What's your MBTI type?

2098
01:01:55,182 --> 01:01:56,652
Mine is type INFP.

2099
01:01:57,192 --> 01:01:58,791
- You're INFP.
- Right.

2100
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:00,661
- I'm INFP too.
- Me too.

2101
01:02:00,662 --> 01:02:02,331
We're all INFP.

2102
01:02:02,332 --> 01:02:03,791
But we're acting excited for the show.

2103
01:02:03,792 --> 01:02:05,461
- We have to try so hard.
- Right.

2104
01:02:05,462 --> 01:02:06,762
We're acting like we're excited.

2105
01:02:07,502 --> 01:02:10,131
(What's next for Drifting Around KBS?)

2106
01:02:10,132 --> 01:02:11,132
- Dex.
- Yes?

2107
01:02:11,133 --> 01:02:12,842
You look exhausted, unlike before.

2108
01:02:13,002 --> 01:02:15,612
Being fit for TV shows is surely different.

2109
01:02:16,142 --> 01:02:18,112
- Gosh, it's different.
- It's like the UDT here.

2110
01:02:19,112 --> 01:02:22,382
- This show is like the UDT version.
- The UDT of reality shows.

2111
01:02:22,412 --> 01:02:24,912
I wish something big could be set up...

2112
01:02:25,012 --> 01:02:26,482
at the end of the show.

2113
01:02:26,922 --> 01:02:28,551
- You mean like big games?
- Yes, like some big games.

2114
01:02:28,552 --> 01:02:29,621
Like games on a big scale.

2115
01:02:29,622 --> 01:02:31,091
Let's see if the show can fulfill my wish.

2116
01:02:31,092 --> 01:02:32,522
Let's see.

2117
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:34,621
- More food? I want to stop eating.
- Late night snacks.

2118
01:02:34,622 --> 01:02:35,792
You don't want to eat?

2119
01:02:36,032 --> 01:02:37,032
(Surprised)

2120
01:02:37,192 --> 01:02:38,461
Gosh, what is this?

2121
01:02:38,462 --> 01:02:40,432
(Eyes going wide)

2122
01:02:42,272 --> 01:02:43,752
- It's huge.
- Why is it so spacious?

2123
01:02:43,832 --> 01:02:45,541
(A huge setup that is rare to see on 2 Days 1 Night)

2124
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:46,902
- It's huge.
- Goodness, it's big.

2125
01:02:47,272 --> 01:02:49,711
- That's right. This is it.
- This is it?

2126
01:02:49,712 --> 01:02:51,371
- This is it.
- It is? Okay.

2127
01:02:51,372 --> 01:02:53,081
They put in a lot of effort this time.

2128
01:02:53,082 --> 01:02:54,511
The cushion feels nice.

2129
01:02:54,512 --> 01:02:55,781
It's very large.

2130
01:02:55,782 --> 01:02:58,512
We entered the fiery world again.

2131
01:02:58,582 --> 01:03:00,881
This is the real variety show world.

2132
01:03:00,882 --> 01:03:02,251
We've entered it.

2133
01:03:02,252 --> 01:03:03,751
We prepared this with great determination...

2134
01:03:03,752 --> 01:03:06,521
because your friends were coming.

2135
01:03:06,522 --> 01:03:07,721
- Did you build all this?
- Amazing.

2136
01:03:07,722 --> 01:03:08,791
Yes. We built it.

2137
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:10,391
(Awesome)

2138
01:03:10,392 --> 01:03:11,661
- Why did you do that?
- It wasn't there.

2139
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,431
Since we've built the set,

2140
01:03:13,432 --> 01:03:14,432
We have to make the most out of it.

2141
01:03:14,433 --> 01:03:15,471
- That's right.
- Yes.

2142
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:17,131
- Anyway...
- We're halfway done now.

2143
01:03:17,132 --> 01:03:18,301
- Halfway?
- Yes.

2144
01:03:18,302 --> 01:03:19,471
We're about halfway done.

2145
01:03:19,472 --> 01:03:20,701
We have to stretch.

2146
01:03:20,702 --> 01:03:22,782
- Warm up. You'll get injured.
- You'll get injured.

2147
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:24,871
- What's that?
- That's right.

2148
01:03:24,872 --> 01:03:26,441
- What did you do?
- That's right.

2149
01:03:26,442 --> 01:03:27,581
- Okay.
- You have to stretch.

2150
01:03:27,582 --> 01:03:29,581
- Stretch your body.
- What are we going to do...

2151
01:03:29,582 --> 01:03:30,611
in such a wide place?

2152
01:03:30,612 --> 01:03:32,051
Are we going to sleep here?

2153
01:03:32,052 --> 01:03:33,081
It would be fun.

2154
01:03:33,082 --> 01:03:34,822
We've been sitting too much.

2155
01:03:34,922 --> 01:03:37,251
Before we start,

2156
01:03:37,252 --> 01:03:39,461
we're going to separate the teams with this.

2157
01:03:39,462 --> 01:03:40,691
Are we making new teams?

2158
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,361
- Just like before?
- Do you want to make new teams?

2159
01:03:42,362 --> 01:03:43,491
Yes. I think we could change it a bit.

2160
01:03:43,492 --> 01:03:45,061
No. Just keep the teams.

2161
01:03:45,062 --> 01:03:46,761
I think it's time to change the teams.

2162
01:03:46,762 --> 01:03:49,301
I was very hurt while eating earlier.

2163
01:03:49,302 --> 01:03:51,401
It was a bit annoying...

2164
01:03:51,402 --> 01:03:53,171
when you went to eat.

2165
01:03:53,172 --> 01:03:54,278
(I didn't know you were so disloyal.)

2166
01:03:54,302 --> 01:03:55,371
She had no loyalty.

2167
01:03:55,372 --> 01:03:57,111
She just went.

2168
01:03:57,112 --> 01:03:59,481
Aren't you going to recover your pride? Let's keep the teams.

2169
01:03:59,482 --> 01:04:00,612
I'm not going to recover it.

2170
01:04:00,782 --> 01:04:02,281
I have to sleep indoors.

2171
01:04:02,282 --> 01:04:03,311
Winning is important.

2172
01:04:03,312 --> 01:04:04,651
Why don't the female members play rock-paper-scissors...

2173
01:04:04,652 --> 01:04:06,022
and choose the team members?

2174
01:04:06,382 --> 01:04:07,481
- Okay, nice.
- Nice.

2175
01:04:07,482 --> 01:04:08,482
Choose the members.

2176
01:04:08,483 --> 01:04:09,951
We don't have to care about our friends, right?

2177
01:04:09,952 --> 01:04:11,451
- That's not right.
- We can't do that.

2178
01:04:11,452 --> 01:04:12,961
- You should follow your friend.
- Your friend should be with you.

2179
01:04:12,962 --> 01:04:15,161
- Your friend will go with you.
- I would have brought Sleepy then.

2180
01:04:15,162 --> 01:04:16,961
Take them off.

2181
01:04:16,962 --> 01:04:18,361
- You have to be with your friend.
- Then,

2182
01:04:18,362 --> 01:04:20,201
- SHUHUA and Han Na...
- We'll wear the vests.

2183
01:04:20,202 --> 01:04:21,202
Will wear the vests,

2184
01:04:21,203 --> 01:04:22,701
- Okay.
- play rock-paper-scissors,

2185
01:04:22,702 --> 01:04:23,731
- and choose their teams.
- Okay.

2186
01:04:23,732 --> 01:04:24,878
- You can choose the teams.
- Okay.

2187
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:27,471
- That's fair.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2188
01:04:27,472 --> 01:04:28,842
(SHUHUA wins.)

2189
01:04:29,412 --> 01:04:31,042
(Yes!)

2190
01:04:31,112 --> 01:04:32,881
- She won.
- Who will you choose?

2191
01:04:32,882 --> 01:04:34,918
- We wouldn't be the first pick.
- Who will you choose?

2192
01:04:34,942 --> 01:04:37,051
- Dex!
- Okay.

2193
01:04:37,052 --> 01:04:39,328
- It's not Dex. It's Dex and DinDin.
- It shouldn't be...

2194
01:04:39,352 --> 01:04:40,721
- like this.
- Okay.

2195
01:04:40,722 --> 01:04:42,822
- I'm not good.
- It's okay. I trust you.

2196
01:04:43,092 --> 01:04:45,451
- Han Na.
- Han Na.

2197
01:04:45,452 --> 01:04:46,962
Hold on. What do I do now?

2198
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:48,291
That side...

2199
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:50,391
- Why?
- Only Dex is gone.

2200
01:04:50,392 --> 01:04:51,738
- What do you mean?
- Why are you saying that?

2201
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,131
She said that because Dex was taken.

2202
01:04:53,132 --> 01:04:54,932
- You have to choose.
- You have to choose.

2203
01:04:55,262 --> 01:04:56,271
Please join our team.

2204
01:04:56,272 --> 01:04:57,301
(She chooses Se Yoon.)

2205
01:04:57,302 --> 01:04:58,671
(He has mixed feelings.)

2206
01:04:58,672 --> 01:04:59,702
Okay.

2207
01:04:59,842 --> 01:05:01,941
- Join us.
- You have me.

2208
01:05:01,942 --> 01:05:03,571
- There's him.
- Okay.

2209
01:05:03,572 --> 01:05:04,611
You have us.

2210
01:05:04,612 --> 01:05:07,281
- Okay.
- Then the blue one.

2211
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:08,481
Rock-paper-scissors.

2212
01:05:08,482 --> 01:05:10,151
She won.

2213
01:05:10,152 --> 01:05:11,411
She won? Han Na won?

2214
01:05:11,412 --> 01:05:13,021
They're all the same.

2215
01:05:13,022 --> 01:05:14,382
She has to pick between the two.

2216
01:05:14,652 --> 01:05:15,851
(Thinking)

2217
01:05:15,852 --> 01:05:17,021
Who is choosing?

2218
01:05:17,022 --> 01:05:18,961
- Sae Ho.
- Okay!

2219
01:05:18,962 --> 01:05:20,861
Okay!

2220
01:05:20,862 --> 01:05:23,332
- Go to that side.
- Our team is much better.

2221
01:05:23,562 --> 01:05:24,691
- I can go, - Our team is much better.

2222
01:05:24,692 --> 01:05:25,831
But it doesn't feel nice.

2223
01:05:25,832 --> 01:05:28,062
- It's like we were kicked out.
- We were kicked out.

2224
01:05:28,102 --> 01:05:29,671
But they're a strong team.

2225
01:05:29,672 --> 01:05:31,931
- We should have brought Se Yoon.
- The balance...

2226
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:33,572
You have to push them with your strength.

2227
01:05:33,642 --> 01:05:35,101
Just push with your body.

2228
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:37,441
It's very likely that it won't be something that needs strength.

2229
01:05:37,442 --> 01:05:38,541
Se Yoon is strong.

2230
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:40,782
Let's quickly do this.

2231
01:05:40,882 --> 01:05:42,611
We will now start...

2232
01:05:42,612 --> 01:05:45,011
Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

2233
01:05:45,012 --> 01:05:47,351
It's a joyous day in which you called your friends,

2234
01:05:47,352 --> 01:05:50,091
so everyone will be able to enjoy it today.

2235
01:05:50,092 --> 01:05:52,091
It's called 2 Days 1 Night Feast.

2236
01:05:52,092 --> 01:05:53,221
- Feast.
- It's 2 Days 1 Night Feast?

2237
01:05:53,222 --> 01:05:55,892
If it's a feast, not just a party, it's going to be hard today.

2238
01:05:56,162 --> 01:05:57,761
- Feast?
- It will go crazy today.

2239
01:05:57,762 --> 01:05:59,261
It's like the All-Star Game.

2240
01:05:59,262 --> 01:06:00,531
- What is it?
- It's something like that.

2241
01:06:00,532 --> 01:06:01,701
Okay.

2242
01:06:01,702 --> 01:06:04,431
There will be three rounds which will be played in teams.

2243
01:06:04,432 --> 01:06:06,601
You'll get points after each round.

2244
01:06:06,602 --> 01:06:08,301
The team that earns the most points...

2245
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:10,641
- will win.
- Okay.

2246
01:06:10,642 --> 01:06:13,181
For your information, we will prepare...

2247
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:16,251
today's outdoor sleeping site to fit Drifting Around KBS.

2248
01:06:16,252 --> 01:06:17,852
- So please do your best.
- I'm worried.

2249
01:06:17,982 --> 01:06:19,822
Is it the place we recorded the opening?

2250
01:06:19,922 --> 01:06:21,552
(No way.)

2251
01:06:21,752 --> 01:06:24,051
Let's begin the first round.

2252
01:06:24,052 --> 01:06:26,362
- Okay. Great!
- Let's go!

2253
01:06:26,762 --> 01:06:28,392
Please prepare for the round!

2254
01:06:28,522 --> 01:06:30,762
- What is it?
- We don't know the game yet.

2255
01:06:30,962 --> 01:06:32,962
What? Something is coming.

2256
01:06:33,162 --> 01:06:35,132
(They hate it.)

2257
01:06:35,202 --> 01:06:37,201
- Why? What is it?
- Jong Min is good at this.

2258
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:39,201
- Jong Min is good at this.
- What is it?

2259
01:06:39,202 --> 01:06:40,301
Jong Min is good.

2260
01:06:40,302 --> 01:06:41,441
- Sand lance extract.
- It's sand lance extract.

2261
01:06:41,442 --> 01:06:43,212
(It's here.)

2262
01:06:43,272 --> 01:06:45,112
I'm getting to see it in real life.

2263
01:06:45,312 --> 01:06:46,342
(Exclaiming)

2264
01:06:46,682 --> 01:06:48,881
I have a weak stomach.

2265
01:06:48,882 --> 01:06:51,552
I have such a weak stomach that I can't even eat cucumbers.

2266
01:06:51,682 --> 01:06:53,951
- You're weak.
- Right.

2267
01:06:53,952 --> 01:06:55,281
- You're weak.
- You're...

2268
01:06:55,282 --> 01:06:56,521
- weak.
- I'm sorry.

2269
01:06:56,522 --> 01:06:57,791
You look like you would eat beetles.

2270
01:06:57,792 --> 01:06:59,562
Then how did you do the survival training?

2271
01:06:59,762 --> 01:07:01,221
- I didn't eat.
- Really?

2272
01:07:01,222 --> 01:07:02,531
I'm weaker than I look.

2273
01:07:02,532 --> 01:07:03,762
(Dex has a picky taste.)

2274
01:07:03,832 --> 01:07:06,231
Round 1 will be the signature game of 2 Days 1 Night,

2275
01:07:06,232 --> 01:07:07,731
the Snack Game.

2276
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:08,732
That's all right.

2277
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,571
This is the most famous game in 2 Days 1 Night.

2278
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:11,572
I want to play.

2279
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:13,542
Sand lance coffee, wasabi rice cake,

2280
01:07:13,942 --> 01:07:15,202
and salty fishcake.

2281
01:07:15,602 --> 01:07:18,672
Only one of each is real.

2282
01:07:19,242 --> 01:07:20,442
- What?
- What?

2283
01:07:20,782 --> 01:07:22,241
- What?
- Only one of each?

2284
01:07:22,242 --> 01:07:23,251
- Yes.
- The penalty.

2285
01:07:23,252 --> 01:07:24,252
That's too difficult.

2286
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:26,522
This is cruel.

2287
01:07:26,652 --> 01:07:28,581
One member from each team will come forward...

2288
01:07:28,582 --> 01:07:30,452
and make a choice.

2289
01:07:30,892 --> 01:07:32,461
If you find the real snack,

2290
01:07:32,462 --> 01:07:34,191
you can move on to the next stage.

2291
01:07:34,192 --> 01:07:35,338
(They can go to the next stage if they find the real snack.)

2292
01:07:35,362 --> 01:07:37,761
If you fail, the other team gets to choose.

2293
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:39,261
- The chances are so low.
- Right.

2294
01:07:39,262 --> 01:07:42,201
The team that finds...

2295
01:07:42,202 --> 01:07:44,031
all the snacks first will win.

2296
01:07:44,032 --> 01:07:46,442
When you win, you will get 100 points.

2297
01:07:47,242 --> 01:07:48,242
- That's right.
- So this is how it is.

2298
01:07:48,243 --> 01:07:50,211
If our team succeeds in finding the coffee...

2299
01:07:50,212 --> 01:07:51,711
and fails in the second stage,

2300
01:07:51,712 --> 01:07:53,111
the next person starts from the second snack?

2301
01:07:53,112 --> 01:07:54,241
- That's right.
- Okay.

2302
01:07:54,242 --> 01:07:56,152
Isn't salty fishcake edible?

2303
01:07:56,212 --> 01:07:58,012
We dip fishcake in soy sauce.

2304
01:07:58,112 --> 01:07:59,581
I thought it wouldn't be so bad...

2305
01:07:59,582 --> 01:08:01,051
while watching it on TV.

2306
01:08:01,052 --> 01:08:03,352
I wanted to crush this thought.

2307
01:08:03,752 --> 01:08:05,391
He watched 2 Days and 1 Night from the military...

2308
01:08:05,392 --> 01:08:07,361
- and said, "They're overreacting."
- Right.

2309
01:08:07,362 --> 01:08:08,362
You have to try it.

2310
01:08:08,363 --> 01:08:09,931
- The order would be important.
- Right.

2311
01:08:09,932 --> 01:08:11,491
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Shall we decide with that?

2312
01:08:11,492 --> 01:08:13,331
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors? How should we do it?

2313
01:08:13,332 --> 01:08:14,561
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2314
01:08:14,562 --> 01:08:16,401
- This is...
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2315
01:08:16,402 --> 01:08:17,901
- Okay.
- We need to make it.

2316
01:08:17,902 --> 01:08:20,141
Joon could finish it on the first attempt.

2317
01:08:20,142 --> 01:08:21,501
- Good luck!
- I'm sorry,

2318
01:08:21,502 --> 01:08:23,111
but don't spit the food out on the table.

2319
01:08:23,112 --> 01:08:24,541
- That's right.
- We have to eat it.

2320
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:25,811
It would be a mess if he spits it on the floor.

2321
01:08:25,812 --> 01:08:27,111
- That's it.
- That's it.

2322
01:08:27,112 --> 01:08:28,112
He made a choice.

2323
01:08:28,113 --> 01:08:29,512
Has Joon ever tried this?

2324
01:08:29,712 --> 01:08:31,211
- He hasn't.
- He hasn't.

2325
01:08:31,212 --> 01:08:32,772
- Don't breathe.
- It's his first time?

2326
01:08:33,022 --> 01:08:34,921
- Good luck.
- Drink up.

2327
01:08:34,922 --> 01:08:36,551
He's drinking it.

2328
01:08:36,552 --> 01:08:37,362
- It's coffee.
- But...

2329
01:08:37,402 --> 01:08:37,808
- He hasn't.
- He hasn't.

2330
01:08:37,901 --> 01:08:39,630
- Drink up.
- It's his first time?

2331
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:41,770
- Good luck.
- Drink up.

2332
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,670
He's drinking it.

2333
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,739
- It's coffee.
- But...

2334
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,010
You shouldn't drink it.

2335
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:47,470
- It's coffee.
- He's...

2336
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,010
It's coffee, right?

2337
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,416
- It's coffee, right?
- Don't do it, Joon.

2338
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,150
- It's coffee.
- What?

2339
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:53,779
- But I'm allergic to coffee.
- Really?

2340
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:55,149
- Really?
- He got it.

2341
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:56,779
- It's late.
- He can't drink coffee.

2342
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,100
- Really?
- His heart beats fast.

2343
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:59,250
It's coffee.

2344
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:00,619
Really?

2345
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,759
(He found coffee in one go.)

2346
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,019
- It's coffee.
- It really is coffee.

2347
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,289
- Lee Joon!
- Amazing.

2348
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:05,529
There's only one cup, right?

2349
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:06,589
It's a 1-in-10 chance.

2350
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:08,106
(He found it beating the odds of 1 in 10.)

2351
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:10,229
- It's really coffee.
- Let me check.

2352
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:11,830
- My gosh.
- How did he find the coffee?

2353
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:14,400
- How did he find that?
- What's going on?

2354
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:16,639
He found it at once. Nice!

2355
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,910
This is really amazing.

2356
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:20,169
The next one!

2357
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:21,509
- The next one.
- The next one.

2358
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:22,639
You have to choose the next one.

2359
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,009
Just finish them all at once.

2360
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:26,079
This is crazy.

2361
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,150
It would be no joke if he finds it again.

2362
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:29,880
You have to end it at once.

2363
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,089
Go with the spirit.

2364
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,166
(Will he be able to succeed again on the first try?)

2365
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,519
- Lee Joon.
- Lee Joon.

2366
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,960
(Is he getting possessed?)

2367
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:40,959
- He saw it.
- Right. Chew it well.

2368
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,259
- Do it.
- You have to put it in your mouth.

2369
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,530
- Eat it.
- All right.

2370
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,299
- Let's go.
- Put it in your mouth.

2371
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,370
- That's right.
- Good.

2372
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:47,730
Wasabi...

2373
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,669
(Did he...)

2374
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:51,510
(succeed?)

2375
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:53,170
(Chewing)

2376
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,709
(Making a fuss)

2377
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,850
- Goodness.
- This...

2378
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:01,350
- Goodness.
- Spit it out.

2379
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:03,280
- Spit it out.
- Is it strong?

2380
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,526
- Did you spit it out?
- Why is he spitting after drinking?

2381
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:06,589
Seriously.

2382
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:08,389
- Eat it.
- I spat it out,

2383
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:10,289
but my mouth is...

2384
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,659
His neck is getting red.

2385
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,290
- Well done.
- There was no second time.

2386
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,129
Well done. You've done your part.

2387
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:16,699
He still cleared the sand lance extract.

2388
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:17,700
Here, Joon.

2389
01:10:17,701 --> 01:10:18,869
It's amazing...

2390
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:19,999
- that you found coffee in one go.
- It's amazing.

2391
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,029
- Dex.
- Dex.

2392
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,899
Dex is from UDT. Show them!

2393
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:23,999
- Let's go!
- That's right.

2394
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,440
Dex will choose right away.

2395
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:27,610
You will see it.

2396
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:30,010
UDT!

2397
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:31,310
He's drinking it!

2398
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:32,709
(The UDT spirit is suddenly gone.)

2399
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:34,880
(Dex is restless.)

2400
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,349
(Laughing)

2401
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:38,120
UDT!

2402
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,249
- UDT!
- UDT!

2403
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:41,490
Drink it!

2404
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,619
- "I'm from UDT!"
- Drink it, UDT!

2405
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,889
- Go to that side.
- "I'm Dex!"

2406
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:47,529
- Drink it.
- What is he doing?

2407
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:49,100
- Endure it.
- Spit it out.

2408
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,899
(In the end, Dex gives in.)

2409
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,830
(Good going!)

2410
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,869
He had it in his mouth for too long. Goodness.

2411
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:56,170
Goodness.

2412
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,870
- It's...
- My tongue hurts.

2413
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:01,486
(Checking the concentration level of the sand lance extract)

2414
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:03,910
(The sand lance extract smell is stronger than usual.)

2415
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:05,549
Why are you overreacting?

2416
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:06,580
(Blowing)

2417
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:10,879
I can smell it from the side.

2418
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,989
Not even Dex could stand it.

2419
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:14,090
Can I go?

2420
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:16,790
- Sae Ho.
- Think about the old times, Sae Ho.

2421
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,589
We had such difficult times.

2422
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,059
- That's right.
- Let's go, Sae Ho!

2423
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,729
Is this even difficult for us?

2424
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:23,759
This isn't difficult at all.

2425
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,799
- I'll do it!
- Do it.

2426
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,100
You can do it.

2427
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:27,699
Yes. Okay.

2428
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,969
- I'll eat it.
- It feels good.

2429
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,200
Show us the middle part.

2430
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:32,610
Bite the middle...

2431
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,069
and chew it.

2432
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:35,540
(Chewing)

2433
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:37,209
(Is it the real rice cake?)

2434
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,610
Really?

2435
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:41,419
- What is it?
- It's the wrong one.

2436
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:43,650
- It's yellow.
- It's wasabi.

2437
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:45,789
(He's suffering.)

2438
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:46,949
It must be really strong for him.

2439
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:48,519
Wasabi or mustard?

2440
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,619
- I'm sorry.
- We ate a load of that,

2441
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:50,719
- but you couldn't win against that.
- I'm sorry, Se Yoon.

2442
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,389
I should return to the basics. When I was Substitute Man,

2443
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:53,689
I could even drink all of the wasabi soup.

2444
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:54,799
You lost all of your basics...

2445
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,929
- after getting married.
- I'm sorry.

2446
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:57,529
- It's finally SHUHUA's turn!
- SHUHUA!

2447
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:58,799
She'll go for the sand lance extract!

2448
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,969
The sand lance extract!

2449
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:01,169
She'll be able to experience it.

2450
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:03,039
- You can do it!
- I think she'll guess it right.

2451
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,199
- You can do it!
- She'll get it right.

2452
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,809
- Things are looking good.
- SHUHUA and sand lance extract.

2453
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:07,539
Okay. All right.

2454
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:09,180
- It's that one!
- Good luck, SHUHUA!

2455
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,109
- Let's go!
- Okay!

2456
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:13,580
- Be tough.
- Here she goes!

2457
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:14,849
Here she goes!

2458
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:16,219
What? It already smells...

2459
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,720
(She drank it?)

2460
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,049
- What?
- My gosh.

2461
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:20,149
- She drank it?
- She swallowed it.

2462
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:21,349
- It's coffee.
- It must be coffee.

2463
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:22,419
- It must be coffee.
- Really?

2464
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,390
It smells a lot though.

2465
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,230
But she looks fine.

2466
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,659
This makes no sense.

2467
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:28,999
- Hold on.
- I'll just smell it.

2468
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,130
- It might be coffee.
- Coffee.

2469
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:34,350
- No.
- You don't have to go that far.

2470
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:36,470
But I'm fine.

2471
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:38,169
- Really?
- I'm okay.

2472
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:39,486
(Checking the smell again just in case)

2473
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:40,869
- Gosh!
- It's the sand lance extract?

2474
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:43,080
(It isn't fine even from the smell of it.)

2475
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,239
Why am I okay?

2476
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,709
- What?
- You can be okay with that?

2477
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,579
- You failed.
- Gosh.

2478
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,819
SHUHUA, you failed.

2479
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:50,079
- You can't drink that.
- Really?

2480
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,149
- You'll be in trouble.
- SHUHUA is done.

2481
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:52,189
Se Yoon.

2482
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:54,349
- Right.
- Let's go! Show us your spirit.

2483
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:56,789
Have you seen me spit out what has gone in my mouth?

2484
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:58,089
- Gosh.
- How reliable.

2485
01:12:58,090 --> 01:12:59,090
- He's the real deal.
- Let's go!

2486
01:12:59,091 --> 01:13:01,030
I can even eat rotten things.

2487
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,329
- Why would you eat rotten things?
- I can eat stinky tofu well.

2488
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:04,999
- This one is plump, isn't it?
- It's plump.

2489
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,030
It's the biggest one. What does that mean?

2490
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:08,440
It's wanting me to eat it.

2491
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:10,600
It's wanting you to eat it.

2492
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,169
- Here I go.
- Okay.

2493
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:13,890
- In one bite?
- Let's see how he'll react.

2494
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:15,380
Okay. What?

2495
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:17,479
What? It's a honey rice cake.

2496
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,450
(Excited)

2497
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:21,910
- Is it a honey rice cake?
- Why aren't you chewing it?

2498
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,419
- Gosh.
- He isn't chewing it.

2499
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:24,896
- He isn't chewing it.
- What are you doing?

2500
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,550
- He's miming.
- Gosh.

2501
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:28,789
- He's about to explode.
- I see tears.

2502
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:29,790
What?

2503
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:31,890
It's the honey rice cake!

2504
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:34,660
(His conviction is shaking.)

2505
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,360
- Keep going.
- It's okay.

2506
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,799
- Bear with it!
- Bear with it!

2507
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,330
- Bear with it!
- Bear with it!

2508
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,269
- You can't bear with that.
- Did you eat it?

2509
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:43,439
It's delicious.

2510
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,569
(I got you, didn't I?)

2511
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:45,969
- It's a honey rice cake?
- You ate it?

2512
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:47,039
- Really?
- Gosh.

2513
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,209
- What?
- It's a rice cake?

2514
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:50,409
- It's a rice cake?
- It's a rice cake.

2515
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:51,756
- Let me smell it.
- It was an actual rice cake?

2516
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:53,149
- Awesome.
- Gosh.

2517
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:54,679
- I can smell the beans.
- Let me smell it.

2518
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,349
- Gosh, that's amazing.
- You can smell the filling.

2519
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:57,619
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2520
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:58,819
- It must be that one.
- Try the other ones.

2521
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:00,989
- I'm sorry. That's my breath.
- That's just his breath.

2522
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:02,670
I'm really the master of eating, aren't I?

2523
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:04,759
(The master of eating is the best.)

2524
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,789
He fooled all of us with his acting.

2525
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:06,989
(Team SHUHUA is starting to feel anxious.)

2526
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:08,300
One has to be left.

2527
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:09,859
What's with our team?

2528
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,199
- Gosh, he led by example.
- Se Yoon,

2529
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,829
- just go with your senses.
- I'll go with my senses.

2530
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:14,910
- Go with your senses.
- I'll eat the delicious one.

2531
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,969
- This one looks delicious.
- Great.

2532
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:19,569
Nothing has ever come out of my mouth.

2533
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:22,310
- That's a salted fishcake.
- It's obvious.

2534
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,686
- It looks so salty.
- It's obvious.

2535
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:26,909
(Will it be the real fishcake?)

2536
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:28,250
You won't know at first.

2537
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,480
(Please be the real fishcake!)

2538
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,290
(Highly expectant)

2539
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:34,290
(Freezing)

2540
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,320
- I didn't know at first.
- Gosh.

2541
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:37,519
It's here!

2542
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,359
- It's here!
- Drink the soup!

2543
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,429
Se Yoon has never spat out food!

2544
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:43,929
"I have never spat out food in my life."

2545
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,700
- What will he do?
- His lips aren't moving.

2546
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:47,570
There's still half of it left.

2547
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:51,369
(He gives up on his conviction in the end.)

2548
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:52,640
Really?

2549
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:54,369
(Disappointed)

2550
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:56,280
- He failed.
- Gosh.

2551
01:14:56,810 --> 01:14:58,610
- Se Yoon has finally...
- Oh, no.

2552
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,649
(The ultimate taste of salt that makes you retch)

2553
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:02,220
- You can't eat that.
- You can't?

2554
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,679
- It's too strong.
- Who is next?

2555
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,619
- Go, DinDin!
- You were going to finish it.

2556
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,249
- Go, DinDin.
- Come on, DinDin.

2557
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:08,619
- Show us.
- Let's go.

2558
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:09,819
- Okay.
- Go!

2559
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:10,919
What a man!

2560
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,736
(He drinks it right away like a tough guy unlike him.)

2561
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,360
(The tough guy moment that surprised even the former UDT soldier)

2562
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:17,230
- DinDin.
- Move quickly.

2563
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,329
- It's coffee.
- Really?

2564
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:20,999
(He finishes it up like a man as it seems to be coffee.)

2565
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,569
- It's coffee.
- What?

2566
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:24,370
- It's coffee.
- What was that?

2567
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,009
(Totally scared)

2568
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:27,369
What was that?

2569
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:28,509
(The coward returns only after 10 seconds.)

2570
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:31,110
He was just lucky, but he's trying to look so cool.

2571
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:32,509
It was coffee.

2572
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:33,510
(They pass the sand lance coffee section thanks to DinDin.)

2573
01:15:33,511 --> 01:15:35,149
- That was so impressive, though.
- That was nice.

2574
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:36,550
You were a bit like Dex.

2575
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,520
- That was impressive.
- That was impressive.

2576
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,789
Just go for it!

2577
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:42,820
(Eating it wildly like Dex again)

2578
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,389
- It's here.
- Just go with it.

2579
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:47,059
Get back to yourself now.

2580
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,700
(Being like Dex is now over.)

2581
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,929
(It serves you right!)

2582
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:52,729
Han Na will end the game now.

2583
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:53,999
It's a 1 out of 7 chance.

2584
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,016
We have to do another round if we don't end it here.

2585
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,069
It has to end here.

2586
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:58,609
Let's go, Han Na!

2587
01:15:58,610 --> 01:16:01,309
- Can you tell by looking at them?
- Nothing will change.

2588
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:02,479
- Really?
- She got one.

2589
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,739
Done. Here we go.

2590
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,810
Let's go, Han Na.

2591
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:06,309
- Let's go.
- It looks delicious!

2592
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:07,609
- All right.
- Okay.

2593
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:08,979
It doesn't look salty. It looks fine.

2594
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,119
(Acting before eating it as she's an actress)

2595
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,219
- There's her acting.
- She's filming for a commercial.

2596
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:13,919
The actress feels different.

2597
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,590
Think of it as a fishcake commercial.

2598
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:17,389
(Shall I aim for a commercial while I'm at it?)

2599
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:19,129
Think of it as a fishcake commercial.

2600
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:20,429
- It looks delicious!
- "It's delicious!"

2601
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:22,190
- "Gosh, it's delicious!"
- "The soup is..."

2602
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,099
(Giving up on the fishcake commercial)

2603
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,570
Show us more of your acting.

2604
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:27,370
- "Amazing!" Gosh.
- Really?

2605
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,070
Spit it out anywhere.

2606
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,140
- Gosh.
- It wasn't the real one.

2607
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,339
Let's get it.

2608
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,809
- It's too salty to eat?
- It's too salty.

2609
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:34,839
- It's too salty.
- All right.

2610
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,780
- Our master is playing.
- The master.

2611
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:39,349
- He can tell right away.
- Right.

2612
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:41,879
He can tell right away.

2613
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,679
He's played this game for 18 years.

2614
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,649
Jong Min already knows.

2615
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:47,820
He's played it for almost 20 years.

2616
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,619
He has been with 2 Days 1 Night for 18 years.

2617
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:51,759
He's a master.

2618
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,730
- Jong Min feels reliable.
- Go!

2619
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:56,529
- He'll know.
- He can tell by the shape of it.

2620
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:57,699
He did this for 18 years.

2621
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:58,829
(He picks up a rice cake after looking for a while.)

2622
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:00,700
He chose the thinnest one.

2623
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:02,769
(The master chose the thinnest rice cake.)

2624
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:04,199
- Okay.
- The thinnest one.

2625
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,339
Should I tell you why he chose the thinnest one?

2626
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:07,669
- Why did he choose that one?
- Even if he's wrong,

2627
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:09,409
he'll eat just a little bit of the mustard.

2628
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:10,410
(Being meticulous enough to plan even for the worst outcome)

2629
01:17:10,411 --> 01:17:12,080
- He planned for both outcomes.
- Go.

2630
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:13,750
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2631
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:15,419
(He confidently puts it in his mouth.)

2632
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:16,880
Let's see Jong Min's acting.

2633
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,949
- Here's the Kim Jong Min Show.
- Gosh.

2634
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:21,520
- Take a look.
- Gosh.

2635
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,559
(Expectant)

2636
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,960
- Let's see it.
- I already saw it.

2637
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,330
His acting is amazing!

2638
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:28,999
(His whole body feels thrilled by the taste out of this world.)

2639
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,230
- Look at that!
- Gosh.

2640
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,830
The Kim Jong Min Show! "I'm Kim Jong Min!"

2641
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,200
There we go.

2642
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:37,269
(The show ends with him fainting.)

2643
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:39,340
- He went that far.
- Gosh.

2644
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:42,040
Jong Min didn't want to lose his place to Dex.

2645
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,179
You can't do that.

2646
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:46,149
- I can't do that.
- Right.

2647
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:47,810
- Gosh.
- I can never get sick of that.

2648
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:50,020
Even an encore performance.

2649
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,849
- It's Joon's turn.
- Right.

2650
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:53,189
- Joon!
- Joon can do this.

2651
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:54,720
- You can do this.
- Joon!

2652
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:56,259
Just end it. Let's move on to the next game.

2653
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:57,319
- Gosh.
- Right.

2654
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,190
(He chooses right away.)

2655
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,759
- All right.
- I've got a feeling.

2656
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,499
- All right.
- It's this one.

2657
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,030
- This one looks fine.
- He got it.

2658
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,069
Just drink all of it.

2659
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:08,170
- Drink it!
- What?

2660
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:10,770
(Expecting him to succeed)

2661
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:12,040
Just drink the soup.

2662
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:14,809
- Is it real?
- It must be real.

2663
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:16,139
He won't be able to eat it like that if it's fake.

2664
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,479
(It must be real.)

2665
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,980
- Is it real?
- Is it okay?

2666
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,709
Right? He won't be able to eat it like this if it's fake.

2667
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:24,480
(Sae Ho tries it.)

2668
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,550
(Joon has done it again!)

2669
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:29,559
(He manages to find the real fishcake after the coffee!)

2670
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,259
- Gosh!
- Yes!

2671
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:33,059
- Gosh.
- That was insane.

2672
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:35,529
- He found two of them.
- Does that make sense?

2673
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:38,499
All right, everyone. Team Han Na wins!

2674
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,769
You will be given 100 points.

2675
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:41,369
- That was great, Joon.
- Right.

2676
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:42,539
- Great job.
- The MVP.

2677
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:43,540
- Nice one.
- He was our hero.

2678
01:18:43,541 --> 01:18:46,239
Everyone, Round Two will be done in the room right next to this.

2679
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,440
- Okay.
- Okay.

2680
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:48,709
Great job.

2681
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:50,580
Let's move.

2682
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:53,280
What is this? Are we doing the vault?

2683
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:54,949
What is this?

2684
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:56,649
- What could this be?
- This looks like fun.

2685
01:18:56,650 --> 01:18:57,679
What is this?

2686
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,689
Dex, this looks like something you were waiting for.

2687
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:01,290
I think we'll be beating people up.

2688
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,690
Is it like the single log bridge?

2689
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,159
- Right now, - Yes?

2690
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,260
- Team Han Na is ahead.
- Okay.

2691
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,599
It's over if we win this one.

2692
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,030
An enemy is encountered on a single log bridge, right?

2693
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:16,739
The game for Round Two for Team Han Na and Team SHUHUA...

2694
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:18,369
is Partner Pillow Fight.

2695
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:19,839
- I see.
- What is the Partner Pillow Fight?

2696
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:20,969
- What is the Partner Pillow Fight?
- "Partner?"

2697
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:23,240
- Why "partner?"
- It will be done in pairs.

2698
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:26,409
- It's been a while to see this.
- It's been a while to see this.

2699
01:19:26,410 --> 01:19:27,909
On the single log bridge that you are seeing,

2700
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:29,649
two partners will go up together...

2701
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,450
and have a team pillow fight.

2702
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:34,749
The team to bring down all of their opponents will win.

2703
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:37,819
The team to win more rounds will be given 100 points.

2704
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:39,030
Got it.

2705
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:40,529
- They're just a piece of cake.
- Right.

2706
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:42,429
- ChoNam Zone will be a free win.
- We'll just go for...

2707
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:43,729
Don't get caught by me.

2708
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:45,230
I'm a tennis player.

2709
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:47,629
- Let's hurry.
- What did we go for?

2710
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:48,740
The first round.

2711
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:50,200
Are you ready, SHUHUA?

2712
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:53,840
(The first participant to intimidate the opponent)

2713
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,509
(Team SHUHUA's player, )

2714
01:19:57,510 --> 01:20:00,410
(Captain SHUHUA)

2715
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:03,380
(Facing against the captain with the captain)

2716
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:05,889
(Team Han Na's player, )

2717
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:08,760
(Captain Han Na)

2718
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:10,720
You should go to the front.

2719
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:12,729
- Joon will go to the front?
- Right.

2720
01:20:12,730 --> 01:20:14,630
(Han Na's partner, Joon enters.)

2721
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,930
- Gosh!
- You have to help.

2722
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:18,530
- Awesome.
- Okay.

2723
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:21,940
(It's time for Seon Ho to enter.)

2724
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:23,969
- You should go to the front.
- Do you want to go to the front?

2725
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:25,409
- No.
- That won't work.

2726
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:27,169
- Hey! You go to the front.
- Fine.

2727
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:28,540
But it doesn't matter, does it?

2728
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:30,340
Hold on.

2729
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:32,009
It isn't a bad idea for SHUHUA to be in the front.

2730
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:33,909
- He won't be able to hit her.
- How can he hit her?

2731
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:35,679
- He said he was a fan of hers.
- SHUHUA should go to the front.

2732
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,819
- He said he was a big fan.
- SHUHUA should go to the front.

2733
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:39,489
- How can he hit her?
- That's better.

2734
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:40,919
He can't possibly hit her.

2735
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,159
- He said he was a big fan.
- No way.

2736
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,419
From a few weeks ago,

2737
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,529
- he said he was a big fan of hers.
- That's so cheap.

2738
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:47,629
Right.

2739
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:49,310
- What are you doing?
- That can't happen.

2740
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:51,499
He can't go against her.

2741
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,299
- I have a plan.
- We'll go with this.

2742
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,570
Just hold on tight.

2743
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:57,469
Don't think about using the pillow.

2744
01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:58,640
Just hold on tight.

2745
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,469
- SHUHUA, will you be okay?
- Joon!

2746
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:01,639
He can't possibly hit a girl.

2747
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,709
- How can you use that strategy?
- I brought my friend here,

2748
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:05,230
and I'm making her fight against Joon.

2749
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,150
I'll go to the front.

2750
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,080
- "Okay."
- It's okay.

2751
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,696
- I'm sorry, but switch places.
- I'm fine.

2752
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,219
- Okay.
- I'll show you.

2753
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:13,350
I'll beat him.

2754
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:15,250
Get ready.

2755
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:17,920
- Let's see.
- Start.

2756
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:19,959
- Okay.
- This is a big match.

2757
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,729
- This is exciting!
- Gosh.

2758
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:23,300
You're a fan, but this is just a game.

2759
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:25,160
Attack!

2760
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,999
- How can I even play?
- Hit him!

2761
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,739
- Hit him, SHUHUA!
- Go ahead.

2762
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:31,040
- You should hit me first.
- Really?

2763
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,209
(I should hit you first?)

2764
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:37,010
(Shall I do that then?)

2765
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,879
Right. That will be fine.

2766
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,320
Slowly take turns to hit each other.

2767
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,879
- Gosh.
- What was that?

2768
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,450
- Right. Like that.
- What was that?

2769
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:45,389
- Why are you smiling?
- What are you doing?

2770
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:46,520
Why are you smiling?

2771
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:49,120
What are you doing?

2772
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:50,689
Gently. That's it.

2773
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:51,860
(Smiling)

2774
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:54,530
(He fails to hold back his smile.)

2775
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:57,500
What? Why is he smiling?

2776
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,630
- It's...
- What are you doing?

2777
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,930
- What?
- This game is fun.

2778
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:03,500
What is going on?

2779
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:06,240
Hey, you should play the game.

2780
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:08,539
Well... I'll just do it with my own strategy.

2781
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:09,579
- Right.
- Joon, do it.

2782
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:11,340
I will win without using my hands.

2783
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:13,950
- How?
- Hold tight, SHUHUA.

2784
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,850
Hold tight, SHUHUA.

2785
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,820
No! Hang on!

2786
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,659
- SHUHUA is about to fall.
- Hang in there, SHUHUA.

2787
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:24,960
Hang in there.

2788
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:27,860
(Her teammates are heartbroken.)

2789
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:30,229
(Struggling)

2790
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:31,929
I feel bad to do this.

2791
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:33,900
What should I do? I'm sorry.

2792
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:36,969
SHUHUA, are you all right? Are you okay?

2793
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:38,099
- I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

2794
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,409
(SHUHUA sits back up.)

2795
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:41,139
- Hang on.
- Oh, no.

2796
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:42,939
There you go, SHUHUA!

2797
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:44,939
- What?
- What just happened?

2798
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:46,550
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

2799
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:49,020
There you go, SHUHUA!

2800
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:51,619
- Just do it.
- There you go, SHUHUA!

2801
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:53,620
(Lee Joon suddenly starts his tightrope strategy.)

2802
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:59,029
(It seems like he made up his mind!)

2803
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:01,030
- There you go, SHUHUA!
- What?

2804
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:03,230
(Trembling)

2805
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:05,259
- What are you doing?
- Joon, don't try anything strange.

2806
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:07,246
(The whole thing is a build-up to knock Seon Ho down.)

2807
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:10,600
(Seon Ho versus Lee Joon)

2808
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,140
Joon, don't try anything strange.

2809
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,440
- Now! It's time!
- No!

2810
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,349
(While trying to hit Seon Ho, )

2811
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:22,080
(he faces a crisis of falling off.)

2812
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:26,920
- Now! It's time!
- No!

2813
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:29,189
(Will Lee Joon...)

2814
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:31,990
(be able to hold out?)

2815
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:35,899
(Lee Joon is out.)

2816
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:36,999
Yes!

2817
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,799
- But we have Kang Han Na.
- We have Kang Han Na.

2818
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,700
- We have Kang Han Na.
- Kang Han Na.

2819
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:43,139
- It's Kang Han Na.
- Kang Han Na.

2820
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:44,839
She's not weak. She's Kang Han Na.

2821
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,040
Kang Han Na can do this.

2822
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:47,609
Strong Kang Han Na can do this.

2823
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:50,380
(Captain Han Na advances without hesitation and smashes them.)

2824
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:53,309
- There you go!
- Hey!

2825
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:55,680
- Fight back, Seon Ho.
- What are you doing?

2826
01:23:56,820 --> 01:24:00,350
(She's so high-spirited that it's hard to believe it's 2 to 1.)

2827
01:24:01,790 --> 01:24:05,020
(Smiling innocently)

2828
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:07,059
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

2829
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:08,289
(Right then, SHUHUA gets exhausted and falls off.)

2830
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:09,599
- What?
- Really?

2831
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,329
- What was that?
- What?

2832
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:12,399
(It's Seon Ho versus Han Na.)

2833
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,530
I can't hit her.

2834
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:16,469
- Hey!
- It's your turn to suffer.

2835
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:18,040
Now you understand how I felt.

2836
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,039
(Now, Han Na is...)

2837
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:23,080
(a wild beast.)

2838
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:25,310
- Hit his head!
- Shake her off.

2839
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:28,409
- Hit his head! That's it!
- Good!

2840
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:29,996
(A wild beast strikes its prey accurately.)

2841
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,119
Hit his head!

2842
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,720
(A wild beast does not lose its prey.)

2843
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:37,490
- Knock him off.
- Strike his jaw.

2844
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:39,859
- Strike his head. That's it.
- His jaw.

2845
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:41,360
(Her partner is proud.)

2846
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,899
- If you lose, you'll sleep outside.
- You have to win.

2847
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,100
- Hold out!
- Moon Se Yoon can't win.

2848
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:47,669
Dodge it. Bend over.

2849
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:49,199
- Moon Se Yoon can't win.
- Lower your body.

2850
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,560
(Seon Ho even dropped his pillow.)

2851
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:56,010
(Will Team SHUHUA lose just like this?)

2852
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,839
- What?
- Grab the pillow.

2853
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,380
- Don't give up.
- It's time. Shake her off.

2854
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:03,380
(Team Han Na faces a crisis again.)

2855
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,419
(Hesitant)

2856
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:08,590
- Push her off.
- Push her.

2857
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,389
(Han Na is out.)

2858
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:13,390
We won!

2859
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:16,799
(Team SHUHUA wins Round 1 of Partner Pillow Fight.)

2860
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,930
(Punishing him)

2861
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:23,040
(Team Han Na loses Round 1 of Partner Pillow Fight.)

2862
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:26,040
(Current Score, Team SHUHUA: 1, Team Han Na: 0)

2863
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:29,480
Let's begin Round Two.

2864
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:31,239
- It's an inevitable fight.
- Moon Se Yoon.

2865
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,509
- Moon Se Yoon is up.
- We can't avoid this.

2866
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:35,486
(Each team's ace players are participating in this round.)

2867
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:38,350
(The ace player of Team SHUHUA, Dex)

2868
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:43,490
(A former UDT soldier's quick judgment and agility)

2869
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,659
(His strength is muscular strength built through regular exercise.)

2870
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,489
Hey, you feel dizzy when you get hit by Se Yoon.

2871
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:50,360
Your head will ache so bad.

2872
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:52,199
- That's not true.
- He's really strong.

2873
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,270
He's just making a fuss.

2874
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:58,039
(Dex of 2 Days 1 Night)

2875
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:00,160
(A warrior who never loses when it comes to strength)

2876
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:04,010
(His specialty is pressing down with his weight of 0.1t.)

2877
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:05,909
This is a big match.

2878
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:07,549
(Round 2, the match between the ace players, begins.)

2879
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:09,219
- Dex.
- Yes.

2880
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:12,619
Let's not turn this into a game of balancing.

2881
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:14,320
This isn't about keeping your balance.

2882
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:16,590
- Be a man and fight head-on.
- Let's just do this.

2883
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:17,920
What do you think, Dex?

2884
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,930
- I'll give it a try.
- All right.

2885
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,430
First, exchange a blow.

2886
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,259
- Shall we begin?
- I don't want to fight a small fry.

2887
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:26,369
(HANHAE, Se Yoon's friend)

2888
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:27,769
- HANHAE.
- Come on.

2889
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:29,439
- DinDin is DinDin.
- Why don't we exchange a blow?

2890
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,500
Let's do that.

2891
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:33,970
- Since I'm younger...
- I'll take a blow first.

2892
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:36,179
- We're different in size.
- Are you going to be okay?

2893
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:37,479
Yes, I'm fine.

2894
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:40,780
Your right face is a little fat, so I'll get rid of it.

2895
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:43,350
I would appreciate it.

2896
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:47,190
DinDin, he always stays in a studio. Teach him a lesson.

2897
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:51,359
(HANHAE...)

2898
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,760
(This is how a variety show works.)

2899
01:26:55,390 --> 01:27:00,470
(The taste of an outdoor variety show is quite spicy.)

2900
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:02,339
- There you go!
- Yes!

2901
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:03,940
(Wobbling)

2902
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:06,369
- This is an outdoor variety show.
- Bring it on!

2903
01:27:06,370 --> 01:27:08,670
- Bring it on! Come on.
- Gosh.

2904
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:11,040
- It's so weak.
- Bring it on.

2905
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:13,610
(Is it my turn now?)

2906
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:20,720
(Upset)

2907
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:23,989
(The small fry explodes.)

2908
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:25,860
- What's going on?
- It's a dogfight.

2909
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,090
(Laughing)

2910
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:30,800
(Fighting)

2911
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:33,700
(The pillow fight looks somewhat pathetic.)

2912
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,470
- Yes!
- Oh, no.

2913
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:39,540
- Yes!
- Oh, no.

2914
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:41,669
- All right.
- Go, Dex.

2915
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:44,010
- All right.
- My goodness.

2916
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,849
He weighs 88kg.

2917
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:47,709
Now it's 2 against 1.

2918
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:51,250
- Let's go!
- You can do this, Dex!

2919
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:52,749
Let me beat UDT.

2920
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:54,489
- UDT.
- Fight against UDT.

2921
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:56,296
(Feeling confident after getting rid of the small fry)

2922
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,089
(Exchanging blows)

2923
01:27:58,090 --> 01:27:59,090
- That's it.
- Good.

2924
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,229
- That's it.
- Good.

2925
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:04,260
(The fight is fiercer than expected.)

2926
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:07,500
(While the unexpected close game continues...)

2927
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:10,840
My goodness!

2928
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:16,540
(An accident happened on the log?)

2929
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:22,820
(While they were attacking each other with pillows...)

2930
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:28,090
(Dex's pillow exploded.)

2931
01:28:34,290 --> 01:28:37,559
(Today's highest temperature is 18°C.)

2932
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:42,470
(Snow is falling unexpectedly.)

2933
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:46,209
(And...)

2934
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:50,080
(in large flakes, at that.)

2935
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,480
(Amazed)

2936
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:59,920
(The weather forecast didn't mention anything about snow.)

2937
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:02,960
(A heavy snow warning has been issued.)

2938
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:07,290
What is going on?

2939
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,029
Help me!

2940
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:12,670
(Victims of heavy snow)

2941
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:15,670
(This is hilarious.)

2942
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:20,270
(I've never seen anything like this in my life.)

2943
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:22,710
My gosh. Why did it burst?

2944
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:27,079
Why... Why did this burst?

2945
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,350
(Dex is flustered as well.)

2946
01:29:28,810 --> 01:29:30,250
I'll lie down for a bit.

2947
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:32,119
What just happened?

2948
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:34,550
(HANHAE is out due to a natural disaster.)

2949
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,019
The king of arm wrestling,

2950
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:37,089
- Moon Se Yoon.
- How did that burst?

2951
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:38,959
- Se Yoon is really strong.
- He's the king of arm wrestling.

2952
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,790
- Se Yoon is no joke.
- Let's go.

2953
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:43,300
It's really hard to hold out.

2954
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:47,130
(If Dex wins, Team SHUHUA will win right away.)

2955
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:49,029
Shall we exchange a blow? What do you want to do?

2956
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:51,670
- Exchange it first.
- You should taste it first.

2957
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:53,140
(Dex attacks first.)

2958
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:54,140
Bring it on!

2959
01:29:55,210 --> 01:29:56,279
(Gently)

2960
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,410
That's weak.

2961
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,589
- I'm sorry.
- Dex.

2962
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:08,389
(It was a lot harder than what he gave.)

2963
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:10,819
- You can hit me now.
- Pay him back.

2964
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:12,989
- Are you okay?
- Dex, you should do the same.

2965
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:14,830
(Attacking)

2966
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,129
Pay him back.

2967
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:19,270
(The battle begins again.)

2968
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:36,719
(An accident happened in an instant.)

2969
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,020
- Are you okay?
- Hey!

2970
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:41,650
(Emergency measures)

2971
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:45,690
- What?
- Pat him on the back. No.

2972
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,930
- Se Yoon hit him there.
- No.

2973
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:50,460
With the edge of the pillow.

2974
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,159
With the edge of the pillow.

2975
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,730
Isn't it against the rules?

2976
01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:55,199
- Dex.
- My gosh.

2977
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,239
(I'm really sorry.)

2978
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,240
(Sadly, Dex is out.)

2979
01:30:57,241 --> 01:30:58,370
I'm sorry.

2980
01:30:59,270 --> 01:31:01,710
He's become a chicken. My gosh.

2981
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:03,409
You must be in pain.

2982
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:05,239
(Current Score, Team SHUHUA: 1, Team Han Na: 1)

2983
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:08,080
- What do we do with him?
- Okay.

2984
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:09,249
- Bring it on.
- Bring it on.

2985
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:10,250
- Okay.
- Okay.

2986
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:12,249
(Jong Min and Woo Il versus Sae Ho and Chang Hee)

2987
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:13,250
Really?

2988
01:31:13,251 --> 01:31:14,749
We can do this.

2989
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:16,289
- Woo Il is strong.
- Right.

2990
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:17,960
- Woo Il is strong.
- I'm strong.

2991
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,489
Are you sitting in the back?

2992
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:21,560
Of course.

2993
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,829
(Dumbfounded)

2994
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:23,929
(The friends for the day have no sense of loyalty.)

2995
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:25,229
- Get on the log.
- All right.

2996
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:26,999
We have to win, no matter what.

2997
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,629
- It's over if we lose.
- It's over if we lose.

2998
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:29,999
(Meanwhile, Sae Ho takes the initiative and sits in the front.)

2999
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,740
- Get on the log.
- Okay.

3000
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,809
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

3001
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:35,239
- Ready.
- Woo Il.

3002
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,139
- We have to win, no matter what.
- Okay.

3003
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,210
I'll do this seriously.

3004
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:41,510
(At this moment, I'll make this into a documentary.)

3005
01:31:41,650 --> 01:31:43,149
This isn't a joke, ChoNam Zone.

3006
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:44,249
- Okay.
- Okay.

3007
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,730
(I'll show you a 20-year friendship.)

3008
01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:48,050
- Okay.
- Ready?

3009
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:50,660
(The final match starts.)

3010
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,230
(They both test the waters.)

3011
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:55,060
(Woo Il's heavy preemptive attack)

3012
01:31:55,630 --> 01:31:57,099
(Surprised)

3013
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,159
Woo Il is strong.

3014
01:31:58,160 --> 01:31:59,199
(Second attack)

3015
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,470
(They kick off with a fierce fight.)

3016
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:03,799
(You live...)

3017
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,970
(or die.)

3018
01:32:06,110 --> 01:32:07,169
Cho Sae Ho.

3019
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:08,170
(Captivated)

3020
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:09,810
- Sae Ho!
- Are you okay?

3021
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:12,510
Are you okay? Are you killing each other?

3022
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:16,140
(The fight heats up, and the log starts to roll.)

3023
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:18,850
(Sae Ho is out.)

3024
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:21,049
(Looking shaky)

3025
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:22,790
(A sneak attack)

3026
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:24,720
(Woo Il is out.)

3027
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,159
(Now it's a 1-on-1 battle.)

3028
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,460
- Jong Min!
- Chang Hee!

3029
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:29,129
Chang Hee! Hang on!

3030
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:30,460
- Hang on.
- Hang on!

3031
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:32,770
(A direct hit)

3032
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:34,730
(Another direct hit)

3033
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:37,069
(He's about to lose consciousness.)

3034
01:32:37,070 --> 01:32:38,200
I think I'll faint.

3035
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:39,340
Seriously.

3036
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:40,509
(Laughing)

3037
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:41,540
Hang in there!

3038
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:44,210
(Feeling sorry for him)

3039
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:47,250
(Chang Hee attacks fiercely with his pillow.)

3040
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:51,750
(He's close to fainting, but he doesn't fall.)

3041
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:55,550
(He's an 18-year variety show zombie.)

3042
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:58,120
(A tenacious hold on life)

3043
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:01,589
(Panting)

3044
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:03,660
(Chang Hee falls, exhausted from attacking.)

3045
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:07,100
(The survivor is the winner.)

3046
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:10,270
(Amazing)

3047
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:13,569
I honestly thought I'd faint.

3048
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:14,740
He looked like he'd faint.

3049
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:17,079
I was about to faint, but...

3050
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,556
(As tenacious as you'd expect a zombie to be)

3051
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:20,849
- My eyes even teared up.
- Gosh.

3052
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:22,210
He can take a beating.

3053
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:23,949
He can take a beating.

3054
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:25,819
That was impressive. He took it all.

3055
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:27,250
Well done.

3056
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:29,589
Here's the result of the Partner Pillow Fight.

3057
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:31,420
- Team SHUHUA won.
- Yes!

3058
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:33,359
You won 100 points.

3059
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,490
You deserve it.

3060
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:37,099
- You deserve it.
- Then...

3061
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,429
- we'll regroup back here.
- Okay.

3062
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:41,669
Prepare for the last round.

3063
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:43,570
(Next episode)

3064
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:46,040
(It's the final match!)

3065
01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:47,309
Let's go!

3066
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:49,269
(Their pride is at stake.)

3067
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:50,540
- Great, Joon.
- Number six.

3068
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:53,249
(It's not over...)

3069
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,310
(until it's over.)

3070
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:58,720
(Who will be honored to be the final hero?)

3071
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:02,590
(Appearing in front of the members who are still groggy)

3072
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:04,960
(A suspicious bus)

3073
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,360
(This isn't right.)

3074
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:08,059
(We're supposed to...)

3075
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:09,230
(get in?)

3076
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,700
(Overcome with anxiety)

3077
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:14,630
(The destination of this bus is...)

3078
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:16,339
- The destination is...
- The destination is...

3079
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:17,370
Please.

3080
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:18,599
- It's...
- What?

3081
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:19,739
(Where will they be taken?)

3082
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:21,640
I didn't think it would be this insane.
