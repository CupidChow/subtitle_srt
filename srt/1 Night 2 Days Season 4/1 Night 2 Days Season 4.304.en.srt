1
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:03,823
(The skies decide your social status.)

2
00:00:03,923 --> 00:00:05,253
The theme of today's trip is...

3
00:00:05,523 --> 00:00:07,923
(Nobleman and Farmhand)

4
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:11,393
(He who angers the nobleman...)

5
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:13,933
(will get a taste of purgatory.)

6
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:15,603
(Welcome to a world of torment.)

7
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:18,433
(For their nobleman's sake, )

8
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:21,743
(they must run endlessly.)

9
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:24,273
(It ends in a brawl.)

10
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:26,313
(They just did as they were told, )

11
00:00:26,613 --> 00:00:28,143
(but all they receive is abuse.)

12
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:30,013
(Feeling wronged)

13
00:00:30,553 --> 00:00:32,552
(The noblemen's tyranny...)

14
00:00:32,553 --> 00:00:34,423
(gets worse and worse.)

15
00:00:34,883 --> 00:00:36,993
(While their guard is down, )

16
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:41,023
(the farmhands quietly plot revenge.)

17
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:44,693
(At last, they're given a chance to change their status.)

18
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:47,563
(Some fight to keep and others fight to take.)

19
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:49,303
Ready, go!

20
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:52,403
(In the fierce fight to change their status...)

21
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:53,542
Se Yoon wins.

22
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:55,643
(Seon Ho lost.)

23
00:00:56,313 --> 00:00:58,813
(But in the ensuing games...)

24
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:00,942
(Farmhands Joon...)

25
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:02,383
(and Sae Ho win.)

26
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:04,583
(They're promoted to noblemen.)

27
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:06,353
(Looking good)

28
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,552
(Noblemen and farmhands change places.)

29
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:11,393
(Their fates changed in an instant.)

30
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:13,862
(Come to me, )

31
00:01:13,863 --> 00:01:15,693
(sweet power of mine.)

32
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:19,263
(What awaits the new farmhands?)

33
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:24,273
(2 Days 1 Night)

34
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:28,403
(It's a sunny afternoon.)

35
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:30,813
- Hey.
- Goodness.

36
00:01:31,143 --> 00:01:32,573
A minister's residence.

37
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,943
This is today's base camp.

38
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:37,482
A minister.

39
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:39,013
Make way for Lord Cho!

40
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,982
- Do enter, my lords.
- Thank you.

41
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:43,053
Thank you.

42
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:47,093
This is where you'll spend the night.

43
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:48,862
- This is nice.
- Until the next agenda,

44
00:01:48,863 --> 00:01:50,392
you can take a short break here.

45
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:51,462
- Okay.
- We can rest here?

46
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:53,863
- I don't need to rest.
- Will we be rolled in this?

47
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:55,732
- Who wants a go?
- Don't step on that!

48
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,502
This is where the farmhands rest.

49
00:01:57,503 --> 00:01:58,503
What?

50
00:01:58,873 --> 00:02:00,903
- Okay.
- I see...

51
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:03,113
a leaf has fallen.

52
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:05,312
- That...
- It's messy.

53
00:02:05,313 --> 00:02:06,612
- Clean up.
- Who will sweep?

54
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:09,012
- There are two brooms behind you.
- Yes.

55
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:10,282
How about one rests...

56
00:02:10,283 --> 00:02:11,552
while two sweep?

57
00:02:11,553 --> 00:02:14,383
- We decide with a game?
- That's a good idea.

58
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,982
- Let's go.
- We shall go inside.

59
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:17,552
- Do as you will.
- Enjoy your break.

60
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:18,922
Rest well.

61
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:20,222
- We will.
- We walked a great deal.

62
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,993
- My gosh!
- Put these away.

63
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:24,092
- Gosh!
- Clean up.

64
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:25,093
(Darn this!)

65
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:26,603
They're as big as battleships.

66
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:28,603
How dare you, Jong Min?

67
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:30,802
- Clean up.
- We were cleaning up.

68
00:02:30,803 --> 00:02:32,232
- How dare you?
- You called for us?

69
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,943
Lay it out right here.

70
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:35,742
Get some rest.

71
00:02:35,743 --> 00:02:37,212
Close the windows if it's cold. Okay?

72
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:39,342
- Yes, my lord.
- This is lovely.

73
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:41,143
- Hey.
- What, darn you?

74
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:43,312
- I used to be a nobleman.
- So did I.

75
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:45,012
- You fool.
- You servant.

76
00:02:45,013 --> 00:02:46,782
- You were born a servant.
- You were always a servant.

77
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:48,422
- Who we are now is what counts.
- You do all the cleaning.

78
00:02:48,423 --> 00:02:49,593
- Clean up.
- You fool.

79
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:51,552
- Rock or scissors.
- Okay.

80
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:52,892
The two with the same thing cleans up.

81
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:53,993
- Okay.
- Okay.

82
00:02:54,123 --> 00:02:55,263
- Rock, scissors!
- Scissors!

83
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:56,833
(Three rocks)

84
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:59,093
- You servant fools.
- We're on the same page.

85
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:01,202
- Rock, scissors!
- Scissors!

86
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:02,203
(Three rocks again)

87
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:03,632
- You servants.
- If I played scissors,

88
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:05,373
- I'd have won.
- Yes.

89
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,172
- Rock, scissors!
- Scissors!

90
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:08,472
(Three scissors)

91
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:09,972
You servant fools.

92
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:11,573
The servants all have the same idea.

93
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:13,582
- Rock, scissors!
- Scissors!

94
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,843
(Rock, scissors, scissors)

95
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:17,383
You fools!

96
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:19,752
What were you called? Silly?

97
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:22,553
(Airhead and Love must sweep the yard.)

98
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:24,893
(Giggling)

99
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:26,993
Sweep harder.

100
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,163
Why you...

101
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:30,293
(While the farmhands sweep...)

102
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:32,762
(The noblemen enter the warm room.)

103
00:03:32,763 --> 00:03:34,132
- This place...
- Gosh, it's nice.

104
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:36,372
- This room suits me.
- It's nice.

105
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:37,903
- There's a room service menu?
- What's this?

106
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,332
Oh, there's sikhye.

107
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,242
- Gosh.
- There's a whole menu.

108
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:43,073
(A special menu for the noblemen)

109
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:44,672
Shall we have some sikhye?

110
00:03:44,673 --> 00:03:46,542
- Let's quench our thirst.
- That would be great.

111
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:48,412
- Yes.
- Three cups of sikhye...

112
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,153
and a plate of hangwa?

113
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:51,913
Come and serve us!

114
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:54,383
Who is sweeping the yard?

115
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:55,923
(Come and serve us!)

116
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:57,223
Yes?

117
00:03:57,224 --> 00:03:58,952
- You should go.
- Who is sweeping the yard?

118
00:03:58,953 --> 00:03:59,962
Who do you want?

119
00:03:59,963 --> 00:04:01,692
Who isn't sweeping the yard?

120
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:03,332
The non-sweeper, they want you.

121
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,733
I have a good idea.

122
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:06,533
Does it take two to sweep?

123
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:08,062
That's what they said.

124
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:10,572
- Come and serve us.
- He should be beaten with a cudgel!

125
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:12,733
- Who is being disobedient?
- Yoo Seon Ho.

126
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:13,973
Come here!

127
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:16,003
How dare you be so insolent?

128
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:17,843
Did you ask for me, my lords?

129
00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:20,212
We found a menu.

130
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:21,243
I see.

131
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:24,713
Bring us some sikhye. A whole set.

132
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:26,313
- Where from?
- We want...

133
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:29,182
Yes, my lords.

134
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:30,293
(Do not make them repeat commands.)

135
00:04:31,153 --> 00:04:32,153
(Discontent grumbling)

136
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:34,063
- You did not train him well.
- I apologize.

137
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:36,433
They want sikhye.

138
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,493
- What?
- Get it, then.

139
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:40,433
Where's the sikhye?

140
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:42,433
Sikhye? Hey.

141
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:44,803
Hey.

142
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:49,402
(The farmhands suddenly jump to their feet!)

143
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:50,943
Airhead!

144
00:04:51,473 --> 00:04:52,543
Yes?

145
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:54,443
- Yes, my lord?
- DinDin.

146
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:57,252
My dear old farmhand Airhead.

147
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,283
Yes.

148
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,483
- Let's drink their sikhye.
- Yes.

149
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:05,552
(The refreshment and snacks...)

150
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:08,323
(are laid out next door.)

151
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:10,932
- Be quick.
- Let's eat.

152
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:12,263
(They had an ulterior motive!)

153
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:15,433
This is great.

154
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,372
(They're slacking off on their duties.)

155
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:20,303
- This is nice.
- This is life.

156
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:23,913
- This is a long, tiring day.
- Okay.

157
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:26,583
- I see we get room service.
- Yes.

158
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,212
Can you give me a massage?

159
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:29,543
- A massage?
- A massage.

160
00:05:30,853 --> 00:05:31,883
Okay.

161
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:35,623
Come in and bring Love with you.

162
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:39,023
Love went over there to get the snacks.

163
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:40,593
I'll go and get Love.

164
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:41,823
Love!

165
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:43,733
I think...

166
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,663
they'll beat us if they find out.

167
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:47,462
You fools.

168
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,903
I'll be sure to tell on you.

169
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:51,433
- Come and eat something.
- Okay.

170
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:52,633
My gosh.

171
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:56,513
(He joins them.)

172
00:05:56,913 --> 00:05:58,873
- I was born into a noble family.
- I heard about it.

173
00:05:59,013 --> 00:06:00,043
I heard.

174
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:01,683
I'm bored.

175
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:05,183
Shall we play fetch with the farmhands?

176
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:07,783
- What do you mean?
- We throw something outside...

177
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:09,483
and get them to bring it in their mouths.

178
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:12,623
- That's a good idea.
- We'll see who's fastest.

179
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:16,563
(The farmhands are having a great time slacking off.)

180
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,193
Okay. Let's take one of each.

181
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:21,432
Add salt to two.

182
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:22,603
(Salt?)

183
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:25,302
(Lots of salt)

184
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,573
Yes, that one.

185
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:31,013
(They're going to mess with the noblemen!)

186
00:06:31,513 --> 00:06:33,243
Drink this and die!

187
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:35,813
(He seems to have a serious grudge.)

188
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:37,953
Isn't this a bit too dangerous?

189
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,452
- Shall we do just one?
- No. Let's go.

190
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:43,153
- Two?
- Two salty drinks is a bit much.

191
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:44,922
- Isn't this too harsh?
- It's fine.

192
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:46,023
Is it?

193
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:47,723
We can't be too late. Let's go.

194
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:51,833
(They hurry back to avoid suspicion.)

195
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,432
- My lord!
- My gosh. Aren't you so smart?

196
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:55,902
- You're here.
- Okay.

197
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:57,172
My gosh.

198
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:59,703
- Can we...
- Can we have a sip?

199
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:01,672
Doesn't this hangwa look appetizing?

200
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:02,842
- It looks so tasty.
- Yes.

201
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:03,843
(Acting like they didn't eat it)

202
00:07:03,844 --> 00:07:05,172
- Doesn't it look tasty?
- It does.

203
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:06,173
Watch Lord Moon.

204
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:07,812
The one who bring this back will get to eat.

205
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:09,343
(The one who bring this back will get to eat.)

206
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:12,582
(They go out to fetch it to have more of hangwa.)

207
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,383
Give it to me. Give me one.

208
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:16,793
(On the other hand, )

209
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:21,093
(Lord Joon has a sip of sikhye.)

210
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:25,893
Why is sikhye so salty?

211
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:29,433
- Really?
- Yes.

212
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:31,073
- Try it.
- It's salty?

213
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:33,973
You brat.

214
00:07:36,613 --> 00:07:38,973
(They taste the sikhye their farmhands brought.)

215
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:42,442
All three of you, stand over there.

216
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:43,512
(All three farmhands assemble.)

217
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:45,613
- All of you, stand over there.
- It shouldn't taste salty, right?

218
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,382
- Listen to me now.
- This isn't regular sikhye.

219
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:49,952
Whoever comes clean now...

220
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:51,493
- Is there something wrong?
- Listen to me now.

221
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:55,062
Whoever comes clean now will be forgiven.

222
00:07:55,063 --> 00:07:57,262
It was Jong Min's idea.

223
00:07:57,263 --> 00:07:58,362
What are you talking about?

224
00:07:58,363 --> 00:08:00,603
- Airhead...
- Why does sikhye taste salty?

225
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:02,602
My lords, I knew this would happen.

226
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:03,732
- I filmed everything.
- You filmed it.

227
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,733
I knew it!

228
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:08,372
(DinDin filmed something?)

229
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:10,213
Listen to this. This is me talking.

230
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:14,382
(Jong Min is busy making salty sikhye.)

231
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:15,713
Yes, that's great.

232
00:08:18,313 --> 00:08:19,683
- Isn't that too mean?
- It's fine.

233
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:20,852
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

234
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:22,423
(He was secretly recording evidence with his camera.)

235
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:25,652
Die!

236
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:27,693
(Die!)

237
00:08:28,163 --> 00:08:29,322
- Airhead said, - Airhead.

238
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:30,832
"It's fine."

239
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,232
- My lord.
- You punk. Follow me.

240
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,963
- My lord!
- Look at this punk.

241
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:35,302
- My lord!
- I tried to stop him.

242
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:36,303
Why don't you sit down?

243
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:37,303
- Sit over there.
- Well,

244
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:38,602
- Yes, my lord.
- I can't sit with you.

245
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:40,102
I'll sit over here.

246
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,503
- My lord, it's a misunderstanding.
- Come out here, Airhead.

247
00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:45,073
Those two gaslighted me into doing that.

248
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:47,143
How dare you, Airhead!

249
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:49,642
Think about all the years you've worked for me.

250
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:51,153
How could you do this to me?

251
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:53,483
I used to be a nobleman.

252
00:08:54,553 --> 00:08:55,822
(Their fates switched in less than half a day.)

253
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:57,423
We live in a different world now.

254
00:08:57,923 --> 00:08:59,253
Drink this, Airhead.

255
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:01,993
- I added a lot.
- Airhead.

256
00:09:03,463 --> 00:09:05,132
I told you to bring me sikhye.

257
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:06,463
So this must be sikhye.

258
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:08,662
You drink it, Airhead.

259
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:11,303
(He tries to drink it as his hands are tied.)

260
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:14,102
(Spitting it out)

261
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:15,172
(Belching out the salty liquid)

262
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:16,273
My lord, I apologize.

263
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:20,283
I'm sorry, my lord. Please forgive me.

264
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,282
He must have no control of his farmhand. How could this happen?

265
00:09:23,283 --> 00:09:24,353
(Screaming)

266
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:26,583
It sounds like he's drinking the poisonous tonic.

267
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:28,822
What an entertaining sight.

268
00:09:28,823 --> 00:09:30,423
- Look at that punk.
- What?

269
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:35,023
(How dare you try to eat at the same table with us?)

270
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:39,432
This isn't just right. He's eating our food.

271
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:40,433
I'm sorry.

272
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,433
- Stare at the wall.
- Okay.

273
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:43,932
- Gosh.
- Great.

274
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:45,003
Wait.

275
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:47,303
Wait.

276
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:49,642
(The noblemen try to discipline their misbehaving farmhands.)

277
00:09:49,643 --> 00:09:51,513
Put your back against the wall. And wait.

278
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:55,142
Airhead confessed to his wrongdoing.

279
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:57,112
- Wait.
- Why don't we forgive him?

280
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:58,183
It was so salty.

281
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:02,153
I'd like to see a sincere side of you, Airhead.

282
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:04,953
- Bring me a new one.
- Yes, my lord.

283
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:08,063
Let me take the whole tray.

284
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:09,723
Let me get one.

285
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:11,533
Let me get one.

286
00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:14,603
(Stealing hangwa right in front of them)

287
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:17,032
Come on out.

288
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,602
(He pulls Airhead aside to discipline him again.)

289
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:19,603
My lord.

290
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:22,103
- You'll make me go deaf.
- Come on out, Airhead.

291
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:24,773
My lord, please stop it.

292
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:27,983
- How dare you, Airhead?
- My gosh.

293
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:29,813
Show me what you have in your right hand.

294
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:32,013
They keep going out.

295
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:33,983
(Fidgeting)

296
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:38,593
(Quickly changing his stance after reading the room)

297
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:42,192
- Please that's enough.
- Gosh, he's funny.

298
00:10:42,193 --> 00:10:43,963
- You're funny, Love.
- Yes.

299
00:10:44,763 --> 00:10:47,663
Great job. My gosh. Yes.

300
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:49,933
Darn it.

301
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:51,432
(Meanwhile, Airhead goes back to bring back sikhye.)

302
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:52,603
I might go deaf at this rate.

303
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:54,073
He talks so much.

304
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:56,342
He keeps on talking.

305
00:10:56,343 --> 00:10:58,543
(Airhead hasn't learned his lesson yet.)

306
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:00,712
- Great job.
- There.

307
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:03,343
My gosh, that's great. Yes.

308
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:04,982
(Noblemen are satisfied.)

309
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:06,713
- He's good.
- Yes.

310
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:08,953
My lord.

311
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:11,122
- You're back.
- Yes.

312
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:12,453
(At that time, Airhead brings back the sikhye.)

313
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:14,122
- If you mess with us again...
- Hold on. What's this?

314
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:15,193
My lord. I brought...

315
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:16,963
- Hold on. What's this?
- My lord. I brought...

316
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:18,893
for you.

317
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:21,533
- In case you get indigestion.
- Airhead...

318
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:25,932
(A moment ago)

319
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,103
Should I put a leaf in it?

320
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:29,073
So he could blow on it?

321
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:31,373
He can blow on it.

322
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:32,912
(Airhead floats a leaf on top of the sikhye...)

323
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:34,483
(in case his lord gets indigestion.)

324
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:37,253
- In case you get indigestion.
- Airhead...

325
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:39,052
- was worried I'd get indigestion.
- In case you get indigestion.

326
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:41,023
- He put a leaf in my sikhye.
- Yes.

327
00:11:41,123 --> 00:11:43,223
Come on out.

328
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:45,092
- I...
- Help me!

329
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:47,423
- Lord Cho.
- I might go deaf at this rate.

330
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:48,893
Come on out.

331
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,833
Drink this.

332
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,803
(Oh, dear)

333
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,073
My gosh. I'm sorry!

334
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:03,473
My lord. I can't drink this.

335
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:05,472
Should we go into a room...

336
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:06,913
- and talk about this?
- Gosh, no.

337
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:09,082
I'm sorry. My gosh.

338
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,783
- Go and wash this.
- Okay.

339
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,552
(A brutal break for farmhands is over.)

340
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:16,652
How dare you? You're a servant. Open the door.

341
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,823
- It's already open.
- Yes.

342
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:19,393
I keep calling them servants.

343
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:22,093
Why do you keep talking down to us?

344
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:23,833
We're farmhands. Stop calling us servants.

345
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,293
- They're different.
- How dare you glare at me?

346
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:28,602
- What's going on here?
- What is it?

347
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:29,762
(What's the next chapter for the noblemen and farmhands?)

348
00:12:29,763 --> 00:12:32,172
This is a government office in Seonseonghyeon Cultural Complex.

349
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:33,603
- It's a government office.
- A government office.

350
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:35,873
He's the supreme figure of the hierarchical society.

351
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:38,043
We will now select a king.

352
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:41,682
- A king?
- A king?

353
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:43,312
Seriously. You guys are all dead meat.

354
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:45,383
If I become the king, you're all going to pay for this.

355
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:47,683
All right. The member who's chosen as the king...

356
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:49,583
will be getting the royal meal...

357
00:12:49,953 --> 00:12:51,793
- kings usually got.
- The royal meal.

358
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:55,293
You'll be able to share the food however you see fit.

359
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:57,263
- Will it belong to him exclusively?
- Yes.

360
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,363
Okay.

361
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:00,803
(Braised chicken from Andong)

362
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:03,573
(Korean galbi sanjeok)

363
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:05,933
(Royal hot pot)

364
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:08,203
(Sweet and sour octopus salad)

365
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:10,473
(Royal japchae)

366
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:13,713
(Fitting side dishes for the royal meal)

367
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:18,083
(The one who's chosen as a king will get the royal meal.)

368
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:20,882
Do I have the face of a king?

369
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,122
Through this mission,

370
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:23,353
an extremely powerful figure will be chosen.

371
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:25,823
It's called Farmhands Do All the Work.

372
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:27,922
What?

373
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,123
"Farmhands Do All the Work?"

374
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:30,592
- What's going on?
- Farmhands...

375
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:31,993
- can't become a king?
- We don't even get a chance?

376
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:33,492
- No.
- What?

377
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:34,932
- What did you say?
- What is this?

378
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,362
- Then we won't play.
- Farmhands don't have a chance?

379
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:38,332
This mission will turn a nobleman into a king.

380
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,972
I've been a farmhand from the start.

381
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:42,302
Does it mean I have to live like this until tomorrow?

382
00:13:42,303 --> 00:13:43,612
I'll keep looking like a dog?

383
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:45,143
You were born to be a farmhand.

384
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:46,312
So you don't want this?

385
00:13:46,313 --> 00:13:47,583
- I love it.
- Okay.

386
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:50,413
- Your class won't change.
- I can't catch a break.

387
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:51,512
Gosh, seriously.

388
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:53,183
- I'll be a kingmaker for you.
- Okay.

389
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:56,683
It's a board game scholars used to play in the Joseon period.

390
00:13:56,953 --> 00:13:58,552
Have you heard of Shengguan Tu?

391
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:00,423
- Shengguan Tu?
- I've never heard of it.

392
00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:03,592
To play this game, you first throw the yunmok...

393
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,263
in order to advance to a higher rank.

394
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:07,163
It's a board game about rising in ranks.

395
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:09,862
We made a board with the final goal...

396
00:14:09,863 --> 00:14:11,573
- of becoming a king.
- Okay.

397
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:14,003
- The one behind you is yunmok.
- This...

398
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:15,502
People played games with this...

399
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:16,702
- in the Joseon period.
- Really?

400
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:17,942
- It's like a dice.
- Really?

401
00:14:17,943 --> 00:14:19,112
- Can I try tossing it?
- It's a dice.

402
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:20,313
Let's say I throw it.

403
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,542
- Is that real wood?
- What's that? Three?

404
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:25,012
It's like playing yutnori.

405
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:26,582
The outcomes are called do, gae, geol, yut, mo.

406
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,682
- Really?
- So...

407
00:14:27,683 --> 00:14:28,883
- that's a geol.
- A geol.

408
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:30,922
- Three. I see.
- So I can move three places.

409
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:33,423
The pairing of the nobleman and farmhand will stay the same.

410
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:35,792
You will compete against each other as pairs.

411
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:38,493
- Noblemen can throw the yunmok.
- Okay.

412
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:41,203
The farmhand will carry out the mission from the box.

413
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,862
- Okay.
- All right.

414
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:44,272
(Ink Random Game, Exiled with Nobleman on Your Back, )

415
00:14:44,273 --> 00:14:45,832
(Jump Rope to Remove Socks, Soy Sauce Random Game)

416
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,202
(King)

417
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:48,842
When your farmhand successfully completes the mission,

418
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:50,413
you can stay in that spot.

419
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:53,542
If he fails, your toss will be invalid.

420
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:54,942
- You can't stay in that spot.
- Okay.

421
00:14:54,943 --> 00:14:56,012
- I got it.
- You'll have to wait your turn.

422
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:58,053
If you catch another nobleman's token,

423
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:00,883
the two farmhands will battle it out.

424
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:03,623
Afterward, the winning pair will stay in the spot.

425
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:06,192
The losing team must go back one place.

426
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:08,193
- Go back one. That's great.
- Okay.

427
00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:11,463
The nobleman of the pair that arrives first at the king box...

428
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,463
will become the king.

429
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:15,002
- So we can be a kingmaker.
- Yes.

430
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:16,603
Then noblemen just have to throw it well.

431
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:17,902
If you become the king,

432
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:20,543
flog all of them, please.

433
00:15:20,773 --> 00:15:22,542
Okay. I'll go first.

434
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:25,143
If they get the squat mission, it's practically over for them.

435
00:15:25,313 --> 00:15:27,213
- It just can't be a geol or yut.
- Right.

436
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,343
I'd rather want a mo.

437
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:30,952
- Here it goes.
- Okay.

438
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:32,052
- I believe in you.
- Let's go.

439
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:33,882
Do I have the face of a king?

440
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:36,383
Get a yut!

441
00:15:36,683 --> 00:15:38,293
- A goel.
- "Move forward one place."

442
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:40,093
- "Move forward one place."
- My gosh.

443
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:41,692
It's the squat mission.

444
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,563
- It's the squat mission.
- It's the squat mission.

445
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:45,162
- Just one.
- The squat mission.

446
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:47,302
- It says to move forward one place.
- What's this?

447
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:48,802
You can just move forward without doing the mission.

448
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:49,933
That's it? Okay!

449
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:51,702
- Without doing the mission?
- Right.

450
00:15:51,703 --> 00:15:52,972
- We don't need to do it. Okay.
- Gosh.

451
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,442
You can just move forward.

452
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:55,673
- We got this.
- Okay.

453
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:56,942
- We got this.
- We got lucky.

454
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,013
(Choraeng escapes from a crisis.)

455
00:15:58,213 --> 00:15:59,242
- Gosh, this is hard.
- All right.

456
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:01,982
Do I have the face of a king?

457
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:03,512
All right, let's go!

458
00:16:03,513 --> 00:16:04,812
- It's a do.
- A do? My gosh.

459
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,683
- Spin Around.
- Spin Around.

460
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:08,322
- Lord Cho.
- Let me explain.

461
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:11,492
You must complete 20 turns within 30 seconds,

462
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:14,492
put down a piece of paper, and stay on it for three seconds.

463
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,022
- Then you've completed the mission.
- That's easy.

464
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:17,593
Complete 20 turns within 30 seconds.

465
00:16:17,763 --> 00:16:18,962
- That was a long time ago.
- All right.

466
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:20,703
- Don't try so hard.
- Get ready.

467
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:22,202
(He goes for it.)

468
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:24,002
- One, two, three...
- Two, three,

469
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:25,172
- Three, four...
- four,

470
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,173
- five, six, - Four...

471
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:27,302
- No.
- seven,

472
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:28,802
- eight, nine, - Seven.

473
00:16:28,803 --> 00:16:30,072
- Eight. That's nine.
- Ten.

474
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,272
- Eleven, twelve...
- Ten.

475
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:33,073
- eleven, twelve, - Twelve...

476
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:34,943
thirteen, fourteen,

477
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:36,782
- fifteen, - He might run out of time.

478
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:38,183
- sixteen, seventeen, - Fifteen seconds.

479
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:40,523
- eighteen, nineteen, - I'm dizzy.

480
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:42,583
- twenty.
- Twenty.

481
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:44,123
- Step on it.
- Hurry.

482
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:45,622
- Hey, this is no joke.
- Five,

483
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:46,852
- My gosh.
- four,

484
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:48,322
- This is no joke.
- three...

485
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:50,023
(He must get both of his feet on the paper.)

486
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:52,233
Two. He failed!

487
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:54,103
- What was that?
- Was it that hard?

488
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:55,502
- Gosh, I'm so dizzy.
- Was it that hard?

489
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:56,533
- Seriously.
- My gosh.

490
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:57,803
(Laughing)

491
00:16:58,073 --> 00:16:59,132
- Gosh.
- Was it that hard?

492
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:00,373
- My gosh.
- Was it that hard?

493
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:02,472
Jong Min, you're so cool.

494
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:03,473
(Disappointed)

495
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:06,213
- This is a hard one.
- All right.

496
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,713
- You failed on purpose, right?
- My lord, I'm so dizzy.

497
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,213
Airhead.

498
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,013
This is your strong suit.

499
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:14,022
- He failed. They must go back.
- We must go back, right?

500
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:15,322
- Right.
- Yes, that's it.

501
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:16,622
- All right, let's begin.
- I have a good feeling about this.

502
00:17:16,623 --> 00:17:18,053
- Jong Min was hilarious.
- I'm so dizzy.

503
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:19,322
- I'm good with...
- We got so lucky.

504
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:20,563
- geol, yut, and mo.
- We got so lucky.

505
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:25,493
- It's a yut.
- It's a yut.

506
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:27,032
- Squat with Nobleman On Your Back.
- Gosh.

507
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:28,763
- Okay.
- All right. Listen up.

508
00:17:28,963 --> 00:17:30,433
- There are two tokens on the box.
- Yes.

509
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,333
The battle to determine which pair gets the box...

510
00:17:33,473 --> 00:17:35,472
- will be Flour Pipe.
- What?

511
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:37,102
Farmhands will blow at the ping-pong ball...

512
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,872
from both ends. Whomever the ball touches...

513
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:40,172
will lose.

514
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:41,212
- Okay.
- Okay.

515
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:43,113
Let's begin. Get ready.

516
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:45,183
Blow it.

517
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:47,053
Okay.

518
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,453
(Using full lung power)

519
00:17:50,723 --> 00:17:52,293
(Flustered)

520
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:54,463
You got this. Okay. It's going.

521
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:56,993
(He gradually pushes the ball.)

522
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:58,962
Okay. It's going.

523
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:00,062
(An intense battle between farmhands)

524
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,333
- I can feel the pressure.
- My gosh.

525
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:04,033
Hey, you punk. Hurry. Choraeng.

526
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,473
(Choraeng loses the battle.)

527
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:11,712
(My farmhand is useless.)

528
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:13,413
- What's going on?
- Hey, what's wrong with him?

529
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:15,583
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

530
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:18,482
- Do you want some water?
- What's going on?

531
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:19,483
(Help this farmhand.)

532
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:21,082
- What's going on?
- What?

533
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,182
- What is this?
- Hey.

534
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:24,052
- Your lips look weird.
- Are you from "Coco?"

535
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:26,853
- All right. Team Love wins.
- Okay.

536
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:29,492
- I was too weak?
- Let's go. Here we go.

537
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:30,693
Get a geol.

538
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:33,332
- Okay.
- That's crazy.

539
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,862
- He's so good at this.
- Jump Rope to Remove Socks.

540
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,932
All right. It's Jump Rope to Remove Socks.

541
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:37,972
Okay.

542
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:39,332
- Seon Ho is good at this.
- It's jump rope.

543
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,242
- I won first place at a contest.
- Okay.

544
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:43,242
- You have 15 seconds to remove...
- This is getting exciting.

545
00:18:43,243 --> 00:18:44,972
A sock while jumping rope.

546
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:46,473
- Fifteen seconds? That's too short.
- That's your mission.

547
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:49,883
But you must crouch down to jump rope.

548
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:52,312
- Wait. Do it while crouching down?
- You must jump rope...

549
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:53,453
- while crouching down.
- Yes, just like that.

550
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:55,352
I'll reward you when I become the king.

551
00:18:55,353 --> 00:18:56,723
- Okay.
- Of course.

552
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:58,353
Let's begin. Get ready...

553
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:01,093
- I hope you mess up.
- Seon Ho, move forward.

554
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:03,762
- He's good. He's fast.
- He's good.

555
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:05,032
- He's good. He got it.
- How many seconds?

556
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:06,033
- Fifteen seconds.
- He got it.

557
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:07,562
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- Okay.

558
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,563
He did it!

559
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,933
- Fifteen seconds.
- He got it.

560
00:19:10,403 --> 00:19:13,433
(He takes off his sock in an instant.)

561
00:19:14,173 --> 00:19:17,713
He did it! My gosh. Choraeng.

562
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:19,812
- My gosh.
- He's definitely good at this.

563
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:21,243
- He's good. Nice.
- My gosh. Well done.

564
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,312
- All right.
- Nicely done.

565
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:24,812
- His cells are much younger.
- Yes.

566
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:25,813
He's so good.

567
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:28,782
Nicely done. You jumped up really high.

568
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:31,322
All right, Airhead.

569
00:19:31,323 --> 00:19:32,492
Get a gae.

570
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:33,852
I might throw up if I have to do that.

571
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:35,222
- It's a mo.
- A mo.

572
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:36,562
Kick the Yeopjeon Pouch. Okay.

573
00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:38,562
Do, gae, geol, yut, mo.

574
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:39,792
To complete the mission,

575
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:41,202
you must kick it five times without dropping it.

576
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:43,032
- Gosh, that's easy.
- Can you do this?

577
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,302
- I am...
- Kick the jegi.

578
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:46,832
- the kingmaker.
- Show me, Airhead.

579
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,043
- Airhead.
- All right. Go ahead.

580
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:51,642
- I'm an airhead - It's over.

581
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:52,713
Okay!

582
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:55,082
- I'm an airhead - It's over.

583
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,083
Okay!

584
00:19:56,483 --> 00:19:57,853
What's wrong with him?

585
00:19:58,553 --> 00:20:00,412
I'm an airhead

586
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:01,652
(Like his name, he's become an airhead.)

587
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:02,683
What was that?

588
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:05,123
Gosh, look at this punk. He's a funny one.

589
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:06,153
(Screaming)

590
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:08,962
(Exploding in frustration)

591
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:11,032
- My gosh. This is...
- All right.

592
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,392
- They can't move their token.
- They can't move.

593
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:13,462
- Back to the starting point.
- Go back to where you were.

594
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,533
- Back to where you were.
- What is this?

595
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,102
- I want a do or...
- A gae is nice too.

596
00:20:18,103 --> 00:20:19,432
- Get a yut.
- As long as it's not...

597
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:20,843
- Gosh.
- Get a yut.

598
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,372
- A gae.
- A gae.

599
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:23,573
- A gae. Spin Around.
- Spin Around.

600
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:24,712
- Okay.
- Spin Around.

601
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:25,973
- You know how to play it, right?
- Believe in me.

602
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:27,342
Se Yoon, if I succeed, it'd be a huge feat.

603
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:29,182
Of course. I'll reward you. Just spin as fast as you can.

604
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:31,153
- If you're ready...
- Get ready...

605
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,282
- All right.
- One, two, three,

606
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:35,452
- four, five, - Great.

607
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:37,022
- six, seven, - What? It's already at 20 seconds?

608
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:38,923
- eight, nine, ten.
- It's already at 20 seconds?

609
00:20:38,993 --> 00:20:40,092
- One, two, - He's good.

610
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:41,663
- There are only ten seconds left?
- three, four,

611
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:44,062
- five, six, seven, - I bet he's getting dizzy now.

612
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:45,132
- eight, - I know how that feels.

613
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:46,762
- nine, ten.
- He's good. Take a break.

614
00:20:46,763 --> 00:20:48,032
- I know how it feels.
- You have 15 seconds left.

615
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,332
- Fifteen seconds. Take a break.
- Fifteen seconds. One.

616
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,802
- Gosh, this is crazy.
- Take a break.

617
00:20:51,803 --> 00:20:52,803
- You can't do it.
- It's been 20 seconds.

618
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:54,502
- All right. Step on it now.
- Once you step on it,

619
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,742
- it will drive you crazy.
- You must step on it.

620
00:20:55,743 --> 00:20:56,942
- Step on it.
- Gosh, no.

621
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:57,943
- He's on it.
- Twenty-five!

622
00:20:57,944 --> 00:20:59,342
- One, - One...

623
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:00,472
- two, three.
- His heels are sticking out.

624
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:01,642
- He got it.
- His heels are sticking out.

625
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:02,882
- He completed the mission.
- Yes!

626
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:04,353
(He completes the mission.)

627
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:06,653
- I guess we're different.
- Hold on.

628
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:09,253
- You get really dizzy from it.
- Stop it. I'm dizzy.

629
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:10,823
- Don't turn.
- That's crazy.

630
00:21:10,993 --> 00:21:12,392
- I got lucky with my farmhand.
- He did really well.

631
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:13,752
- It makes you so dizzy.
- Gosh.

632
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:14,762
- We did it.
- All right.

633
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:17,023
I'm a great farmhand. Being a farmhand suits me.

634
00:21:17,163 --> 00:21:18,562
You're the best farmhand. A premium farmhand.

635
00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:20,233
- I'm so motivated. Let's hurry up.
- Yes.

636
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:23,202
Get a gae. Get the soy sauce mission.

637
00:21:23,203 --> 00:21:24,902
- Soy sauce is better.
- It's a gae!

638
00:21:24,903 --> 00:21:26,302
It's a gae. We got the Soy Sauce Random Game.

639
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:27,332
- All right.
- Okay.

640
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,173
- It's the random game.
- Soy Sauce Random Game.

641
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:30,402
Bring them in.

642
00:21:30,403 --> 00:21:32,013
You can't smell them. You must pick one right away.

643
00:21:32,143 --> 00:21:33,942
Soy sauce? I don't see any soy sauce.

644
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:34,943
What?

645
00:21:34,944 --> 00:21:37,283
- This is soy sauce?
- This isn't soy sauce.

646
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:39,352
Did you know that there's clear soy sauce?

647
00:21:39,353 --> 00:21:40,552
- Really?
- I didn't know.

648
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:42,652
- There's clear soy sauce?
- It's a new random game...

649
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:44,193
utilizing a new product.

650
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:45,592
- Don't stand too close.
- Right.

651
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:47,352
Two of the cups have clear soy sauce.

652
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:48,962
- Really?
- One cup has clear water.

653
00:21:48,963 --> 00:21:50,592
- This is crazy.
- To complete the mission,

654
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:51,692
- you must pick water.
- My gosh.

655
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:53,492
- Gosh, this is soy sauce?
- There's clear soy sauce?

656
00:21:53,493 --> 00:21:55,032
Be a man and gulp it down in one go.

657
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:56,463
(Scanning with his sharp eyes)

658
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,473
This is crazy.

659
00:21:58,703 --> 00:22:00,272
- Gosh, I have no idea.
- How can there be clear soy sauce?

660
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:02,372
My gosh. It's the hardest one yet.

661
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:03,542
Here I go. I'll just grab one.

662
00:22:03,543 --> 00:22:04,972
- Okay. Grab it and drink.
- My gosh.

663
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:07,372
- Airhead, just follow your heart.
- Okay.

664
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:09,942
Didn't he pick the right one when the odds were 1 to 5?

665
00:22:09,943 --> 00:22:10,983
Believe in yourself, Jong Min.

666
00:22:11,353 --> 00:22:12,782
Gosh, it's real soy sauce.

667
00:22:12,783 --> 00:22:14,123
Hey, how can this be?

668
00:22:14,423 --> 00:22:15,522
- Okay.
- Please.

669
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:16,822
If you get this right, you'll be the Random Game Deity.

670
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:18,493
- I will pick...
- Which one will it be?

671
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:21,162
- It's number three.
- Let's go.

672
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:22,362
- Let's go.
- One, two, three.

673
00:22:22,363 --> 00:22:25,363
(He chugs it down like a man.)

674
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:28,003
(Airhead, please get this right!)

675
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:29,042
Which one will it be?

676
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:30,457
It's number three.

677
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,458
- Let's go.
- One, two, three.

678
00:22:33,093 --> 00:22:34,093
Why?

679
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:35,853
- Is it water?
- Why did you pick the third one?

680
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:37,862
(His facial expression looks iffy.)

681
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:38,863
Is it water?

682
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,232
(Laughing)

683
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:42,633
He's malfunctioning now.

684
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:44,632
He's never had clear soy sauce before.

685
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:45,933
He's confused. He's not sure if it's water.

686
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:48,384
Swallow it. Is it water? Jong Min.

687
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,430
(Gargling)

688
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,230
- Is it water?
- I don't know.

689
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,329
- Drink the second one.
- All right.

690
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,530
- Drink the second one.
- What's this?

691
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,000
What's this?

692
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,069
- Was it really water?
- How did he get this right?

693
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,370
- For real?
- He got this right?

694
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,539
- How did you get this right?
- He got it right?

695
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,909
Jong Min succeeded.

696
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,780
(He picks out the cup with water.)

697
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,480
- That's crazy.
- How did he do this?

698
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,949
How did he get this right?

699
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,020
I tasted it. It was real soy sauce.

700
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
- I just felt it. It was a hunch.
- Gosh.

701
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,719
- That's crazy.
- Did water give you a signal?

702
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,549
- Airhead.
- It's slightly different.

703
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,820
- Gosh.
- All right.

704
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,259
- A geol would mean trouble.
- Give me a geol.

705
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,529
- Get a do. It's a do.
- A gae.

706
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,660
- Lord Lee!
- It's a do!

707
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,730
- It's a yut.
- A yut.

708
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,160
- I got him.
- The 1-on-1 battle.

709
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,599
Here's the second game to determine who gets to stay.

710
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Is it the flour game again?

711
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:34,569
- It's the Battle of Bottoms.
- What?

712
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,469
You will stand back to back, with your bottom touching.

713
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,909
You can't bend your knees. You have to lower your head instead.

714
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,380
- Like this.
- That's right.

715
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
- Like this?
- Like this. Yes.

716
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:43,279
Put your heels together.

717
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,010
- Just push him.
- Push and then grab.

718
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,780
All right.

719
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,420
- You must grab it.
- Let's go.

720
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,850
Get ready.

721
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:51,450
(Who will come out victorious?)

722
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,790
Shift your weight back. Lean back.

723
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,190
(Choraeng wins.)

724
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,200
My gosh.

725
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,830
- Well done. Yes.
- I keep winning today. What's this?

726
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,530
I should've done this.

727
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,639
It just can't be a gae, right?

728
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,640
- Right.
- Right?

729
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:10,670
That's so far.

730
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,939
- Get a gae.
- It just can't be a gae.

731
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,969
- Get a gae.
- Here I go.

732
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,079
- Get a gae.
- Get a geol.

733
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,880
- Get a gae.
- Get a gae.

734
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,880
- It's a gae!
- It's a gae!

735
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,049
(An impending doom hangs in the air.)

736
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,249
(Exiled with Nobleman on Your Back)

737
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,350
- It's a gae.
- Yes!

738
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,750
- It's a gae.
- Okay.

739
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:26,350
Put him on your back!

740
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,289
(Note that his lord weighs...)

741
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,060
The square box over there is the exile zone.

742
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,489
Basically, I'll fail.

743
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,260
If you move away from the exile zone...

744
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,730
or if the nobleman's body touches the ground,

745
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,029
you'll go back to your previous spot.

746
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,339
- I think you can do it today.
- I doubt it.

747
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,740
- You can do it.
- There's no way.

748
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,869
- Try it.
- Never.

749
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,470
- Don't underestimate your weight.
- We'll stall time.

750
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,779
Besides, my weight isn't 120km now.

751
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,509
With the outfit, it's about 126kg.

752
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,950
It's 126kg? He gained 6kg just now.

753
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,379
Here I go. One, two.

754
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,280
(Can Seon Ho do it?)

755
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,249
(No way)

756
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,619
- Let's begin.
- Here I go. One, two.

757
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,120
- Take your time to throw it.
- All right.

758
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,720
Hey, you were a man, after all.

759
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,289
(He's actually displaying supernatural powers.)

760
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,130
Are your legs okay? Are you okay, Seon Ho?

761
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,860
(I can do this.)

762
00:25:06,861 --> 00:25:07,929
- Let's begin.
- You know what?

763
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,059
- They...
- He's hanging in there.

764
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,599
- Let's begin.
- He won't last. All right.

765
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,099
- I'd like to explain this game...
- Are you okay?

766
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,769
To the viewers again. We have to do that.

767
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,869
- Here's why.
- We should.

768
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,639
- Those who just started watching...
- What about Seon Ho?

769
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,179
Wouldn't know what we're holding.

770
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,209
- Right.
- So...

771
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,539
- dear viewers, this is...
- What was that?

772
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,879
- It's different from yutnori.
- Hurry up.

773
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,149
It's a game from the Joseon period.

774
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,049
- Help me out here.
- It's called yunmok.

775
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,319
- Yunmok.
- Don't move.

776
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,389
- What are you doing?
- Yun stands for wheels.

777
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,849
Is it yun or ryun?

778
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,089
- Yun.
- Yun.

779
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,159
- Isn't it ryun?
- Yun.

780
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,890
- Isn't it ryunmok?
- It's yun. Mok stands for wood.

781
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,889
- Just hurry up and move on.
- My gosh.

782
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,230
- Yun.
- Just look it up.

783
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,559
(An outburst of annoyance)

784
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,830
- Just hurry up and move on.
- My gosh. Okay.

785
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,269
- Just hurry up and move on.
- We'll speed it up.

786
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,300
- It's over.
- Let's resume. It's over.

787
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,400
(Lord Moon's token goes back to the previous spot.)

788
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,169
- Three.
- They have nothing to worry about.

789
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,769
- They're way far behind.
- Let's see.

790
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,109
Oh, no. It's geol.

791
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,239
Gosh, why is it gae?

792
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,279
Squat with Nobleman On Your Back.

793
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,409
Okay, it's not bad.

794
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,149
It's Squat with Nobleman On Your Back.

795
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,179
Yes, it's not bad.

796
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,480
You have to do ten squats?

797
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,280
You can do it.

798
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
(Exclaiming)

799
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,889
- Isn't it okay?
- This isn't easy.

800
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,920
This is...

801
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,360
Here I go.

802
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,590
Ready, set,

803
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,890
- go.
- Go.

804
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,030
One.

805
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,100
It must hurt.

806
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Two.

807
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,700
- He won't make it.
- It looks good so far.

808
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,370
Three.

809
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,739
He can do it.

810
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,200
- Four.
- He can actually do it.

811
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,539
(The nobleman is very excited.)

812
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,540
- Five.
- It's iffy.

813
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,080
Six. He keeps doing it though.

814
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,379
Seven.

815
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,950
(The old farmhand is working hard.)

816
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,520
- Eight. He's doing well.
- He's good.

817
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,620
Nine. That's iffy.

818
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,850
Nine.

819
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,220
(He made it.)

820
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,130
- Oh, my. He's very good.
- Success.

821
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,490
He's good.

822
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,660
- Well done.
- He did very well.

823
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,499
My muscles got pumped up.

824
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,299
Touch them.

825
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,630
(Airhead wants to brag about his legs.)

826
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,100
(Impressed)

827
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,469
(Hard rocks)

828
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,640
- Seriously.
- It's too big to hold.

829
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,409
- Pumping - They're like rocks.

830
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,870
(It's strong.)

831
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,409
(This is dignity of an old farmhand.)

832
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,679
I hope that we get the spinning.

833
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,310
Let it be mo.

834
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,319
- It will be gae.
- Mo.

835
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,450
- Mo.
- It's mo.

836
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,089
(Lord Lee's family runs away after throwing a mo.)

837
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,749
Do, gae, geol, yut, mo.

838
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,819
- They're catching up.
- It's our turn next.

839
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,690
- This is good.
- All right.

840
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,889
- We're catching up.
- Is it you?

841
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,929
- Let it be gae.
- Let's go.

842
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,129
- What is it?
- Where will it land?

843
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,199
Gae.

844
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,359
- Gae.
- Okay.

845
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,360
It's geol.

846
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:23,569
Do, gae, geol.

847
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,069
He'll be able to do it. He's good.

848
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,600
- All right.
- Are your legs feeling okay?

849
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,170
- Everyone.
- Yes?

850
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,170
Please pull it off.

851
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,309
- What?
- Is there something?

852
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,609
- There's something underneath.
- There is.

853
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,610
Is there something?

854
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,909
(There's something.)

855
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,910
What is it?

856
00:27:36,911 --> 00:27:38,780
I will pull it off. One, two,

857
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,550
- three.
- "The nobleman must play."

858
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,420
- The nobleman must play.
- Okay!

859
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,719
(It's time for the nobleman to show off his talent.)

860
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,219
"The nobleman must play?"

861
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,989
He can't even sit down in a squat.

862
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,230
Se Yoon can't poop in a squat toilet.

863
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,659
(Things were going well until they faced a crisis.)

864
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,900
Se Yoon, can you do it?

865
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,000
I can turn fear into courage.

866
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,239
I will hold it as tightly as possible.

867
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,570
As soon as I enter, I'll pull it off at once.

868
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,409
- Be careful with your knees.
- Take your time.

869
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,839
- You shouldn't get injured.
- Take your time.

870
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,879
That's right.

871
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,280
- He's good at it.
- What?

872
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,909
(Hopping)

873
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,949
He looks like a toad.

874
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,219
- Don't relax, Se Yoon.
- How is he so good?

875
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,280
Let me take a break.

876
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,119
- How is he so good?
- How are you so good?

877
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,189
I must take them off...

878
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,220
- within five times.
- Okay.

879
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,990
- Jump rope.
- He'll get credit if he does it.

880
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,460
- Get ready.
- If you make it, we'll win.

881
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,060
(Exclaiming)

882
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,469
(Lord Moon starts off easily.)

883
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,599
(Is this possible?)

884
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
He's almost there.

885
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,670
(All he has to do is take off his socks.)

886
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,380
(Close)

887
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,710
(He's close to touching it.)

888
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,680
(His fingers look pathetic.)

889
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,189
- It's over.
- Don't laugh.

890
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,660
(It's so tiring, but I can't help but laugh.)

891
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,960
Gosh.

892
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,430
- It's over.
- Don't laugh.

893
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,500
It's over.

894
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,200
He's better at jumping the rope than I thought.

895
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,570
(We'll take it away.)

896
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
You failed.

897
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:11,670
How could they take it away already?

898
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,979
(The nobleman is rolling on the ground.)

899
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,610
Are you all right, Lord Moon?

900
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,949
Good job.

901
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,280
Lord Moon.

902
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,250
- You did better than expected.
- I thought I could make it.

903
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,060
I know.

904
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,020
- We're playing against Lord Moon.
- You play against Lord Moon.

905
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
(Choraeng wins.)

906
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:34,860
- Okay.
- What?

907
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,730
- One, two.
- He got it.

908
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,930
Three.

909
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:40,170
(4 out of 5)

910
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,070
- Oh, my. Six.
- Five, six.

911
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,270
Seven, eight.

912
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,070
He did eight.

913
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,339
- He's an elite.
- He's really good.

914
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
- You're an elite.
- Is he an ace...

915
00:29:49,341 --> 00:29:50,680
- or what?
- He did so well.

916
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,279
Let it be geol.

917
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,119
- It's yut.
- It's a fight.

918
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,380
(The two families compete in a game.)

919
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,150
(Airhead versus Love)

920
00:29:57,151 --> 00:29:58,389
(The game is Flour Pipe.)

921
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,390
Like this?

922
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,019
- To the right.
- This is the center.

923
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,730
- Come this way.
- Can you lower it for me?

924
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,559
Put your mouth on. Start when the whistle blows.

925
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,599
Get ready.

926
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,629
- Get ready.
- Get ready.

927
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,060
- Get ready and put your mouth on.
- Your mouth.

928
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,029
- Get ready.
- Put your mouth on.

929
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,300
- Okay.
- It's too high.

930
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,769
(Airhead is at risk.)

931
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,009
Blow.

932
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,240
You aren't blowing. Blow.

933
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,980
(His lungs at full capacity)

934
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,680
(He makes a counterattack with all his might.)

935
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,580
(Here it comes.)

936
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,020
What happened?

937
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,619
My goodness. Jong Min.

938
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,790
(He passes out for 1 second due to lack of oxygen.)

939
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,230
What happened?

940
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,000
My goodness. Jong Min.

941
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,329
Are you okay?

942
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,930
(Airhead got dizzy and passed out.)

943
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,930
Jong Min.

944
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,069
- What's wrong?
- You know what's funny?

945
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,640
- Jong Min.
- I passed out.

946
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,810
I passed out all of a sudden.

947
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,710
I really did.

948
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,720
(He blew so hard that his eyes became bloodshot.)

949
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
(Spinning)

950
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,120
Jong Min, you looked so happy.

951
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,789
- You know that pleasant feeling?
- You looked very...

952
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,089
It felt pleasant.

953
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,130
I was wondering why you looked so happy.

954
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,000
- All right.
- What is this?

955
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,330
(Nip and tuck)

956
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,670
One, two, three.

957
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,300
It will be do.

958
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,810
- We can't be sure.
- It's do.

959
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,939
- Yut.
- Yut.

960
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,109
Soy Sauce...

961
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,509
- Soy Sauce.
- Do, gae, geol, yut.

962
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,379
- I Found My Nobleman.
- I Found My Nobleman.

963
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,579
- Everyone.
- What is it?

964
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,549
- What's I Found My Nobleman?
- I Found My Nobleman.

965
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,949
We have a chance of winning.

966
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,150
You must find me.

967
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,719
Put on the blindfold.

968
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,649
By touching the noblemen's faces with your hand,

969
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,759
you must find the nobleman you serve.

970
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
- That's so easy.
- It's very easy.

971
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:43,889
This is a piece of cake.

972
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,889
Recognizing his face is easy. I have to find the squid.

973
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,659
- Wait, the face...
- What?

974
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,100
You just have to find the squid.

975
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,200
- You can only touch their cheeks.
- Here's the first.

976
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,739
(Number 1, Lord Cho)

977
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,600
(Tapping the nose)

978
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,640
(Number 2, Lord Lee)

979
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,680
(They watch while holding their breath.)

980
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,049
(He wrinkles his face as much as possible.)

981
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,680
Five, four...

982
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,679
(Lastly, he touches Lord Moon.)

983
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,690
(Slapping)

984
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,849
(Why is he hitting me?)

985
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,920
Five, four, three.

986
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,590
- Two, one.
- I need to slap to know. I'm sorry.

987
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,630
- Okay.
- To see if it's elastic.

988
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,429
My nobleman is...

989
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:27,340
(What will be Airhead's choice?)

990
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,470
Number one.

991
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,040
(I knew that he'd be right.)

992
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,540
His face was flat.

993
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,179
His face was almost dented.

994
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,209
- What I mean is...
- Was it flat?

995
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,479
His face wasn't protruding.

996
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,249
- Like something flat?
- Yes.

997
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,450
He's definitely my nobleman.

998
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,349
(I found my nobleman.)

999
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,820
(Chuckling)

1000
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,129
(Laughing)

1001
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,130
- It's impossible to defeat him.
- My face was flat?

1002
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,160
When it comes to the face, we can't defeat him.

1003
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,160
Next up is Lord Lee.

1004
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,500
We completely turned the tables.

1005
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,570
It will be over if you don't get a mo.

1006
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,769
Unless you get a mo, we'll lose.

1007
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,640
They have to get a do.

1008
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,180
(It's possible for them to win only with a mo.)

1009
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:13,049
No, he should throw either do or gae and compete with us.

1010
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,979
- I'm throwing it suddenly.
- What?

1011
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,250
Do, gae, geol, yut, mo.

1012
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,490
(Mo)

1013
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,200
(Their only chance of winning)

1014
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,769
- At the end...
- They made it.

1015
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,530
This is insane.

1016
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,800
(What?)

1017
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,680
(How is this possible?)

1018
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,440
This is insane.

1019
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,880
All right.

1020
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,309
Please receive my bow, my prince.

1021
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,679
- Did you see that?
- My prince.

1022
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,979
I took advantage of the confusion.

1023
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,389
My prince, thank you.

1024
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,590
You're welcome.

1025
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,090
(After the days as a running and begging farmhand)

1026
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,660
(And briefly tasting the life of a nobleman)

1027
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,670
(He finally reached a position above all others.)

1028
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,069
(He ascends to the throne.).

1029
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,980
Everyone, bow to our new Majesty.

1030
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,449
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

1031
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,809
Thank you for your boundless generosity.

1032
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,179
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

1033
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,620
- I am hungry.
- Stand straight.

1034
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,550
Let us go and eat.

1035
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,890
- I like his tone.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

1036
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,860
We will hit the slate.

1037
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,530
- Would you like to hit it?
- Lower your head, Director Joo.

1038
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,629
Everyone, bow to him.

1039
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,730
Bow to him.

1040
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,560
- It's Your Majesty's order.
- Bow, everyone.

1041
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,130
We will hit the slate.

1042
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,569
One, two, three.

1043
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,110
(The cameras obey him 1 by 1.)

1044
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,170
Your Majesty.

1045
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,980
- Your Majesty.
- Let's go.

1046
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,780
Clear the way, you rascals.

1047
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,250
Our King is coming.

1048
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,880
- Love is doing a good job.
- Get out of the way.

1049
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,690
- Your Majesty.
- It suits him perfectly.

1050
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,459
Your Majesty, please step on this to go up.

1051
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,290
- I like your attitude.
- Please step here.

1052
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,559
- King Joon is here.
- Your Majesty.

1053
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,629
- Your Majesty.
- His life is...

1054
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,260
- about bowing.
- He's good at it.

1055
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,169
Your Majesty, I will close the door.

1056
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,629
We don't need anyone else.

1057
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,900
- What are you doing?
- Your Majesty.

1058
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,240
- Sit down, everyone.
- Please sit, Your Majesty.

1059
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,970
What is this called?

1060
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,839
Everyone, your dinner tonight is...

1061
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,410
(A complete collection of Andong flavors)

1062
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,250
Andong braised chicken.

1063
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,910
Andong Korean galbi sanjeok.

1064
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,920
(Royal hot pot)

1065
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,320
It's japchae.

1066
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,020
(Sweet and sour octopus salad)

1067
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,690
(Salted pollack roe and salted oysters)

1068
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,390
(A variety of side dishes)

1069
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,559
(Even desserts)

1070
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,590
- This is it.
- It includes Andong sikhye.

1071
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,499
Carefully prepared with local specialties in Andong,

1072
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,870
a royal meal for the king.

1073
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,369
It looks wonderful, Your Majesty.

1074
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,840
Let the music resound.

1075
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,510
Is this what we're eating?

1076
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,670
Do we only get carbs?

1077
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:54,309
(Only rice is given to the losers.)

1078
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,310
All the dishes of the royal meal belong to the king.

1079
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,410
Please taste what you'd like to taste first.

1080
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,979
- All right.
- Enjoy your meal, Your Majesty.

1081
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,319
Please go ahead, Your Majesty.

1082
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,219
- Tteokgalbi.
- Galbi.

1083
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,689
(Andong Korean galbi sanjeok)

1084
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,760
Your Majesty, your food could be poisoned.

1085
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,130
Try some.

1086
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,429
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1087
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,460
Your Majesty.

1088
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Your Majesty!

1089
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,000
Your Majesty, there may be poison in the japchae.

1090
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,740
- Japchae?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1091
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,199
- Your Majesty.
- Try some.

1092
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,710
- Your Majesty.
- I will try it instead.

1093
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,470
Only that much?

1094
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:27,480
(I allow you to eat two strands.)

1095
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,410
(Slightly disappointed)

1096
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,610
(They examine the food that's been given to them.)

1097
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,580
Your Majesty.

1098
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,150
It seems slightly poisoned.

1099
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,190
Should I try some more?

1100
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,120
(Laughing)

1101
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,789
(Airhead turned strange after consuming poison.)

1102
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,430
- You might die if you eat more.
- Your Majesty.

1103
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,730
- Your Majesty.
- After tasting it...

1104
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,430
To me, this meat was...

1105
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,530
- like Lee Joon.
- What's the reason?

1106
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,139
It was perfectly balanced.

1107
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,439
(Perfectly balanced galbi sanjeok like King Lee Joon)

1108
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,469
It was so perfect to be true.

1109
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,670
You're an excellent man.

1110
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,910
I will give an award to the prime minister.

1111
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,679
Your Majesty.

1112
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,349
We were on one boat, weren't we?

1113
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,810
- You're right, Your Majesty.
- And so...

1114
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,149
- He's loyal.
- Your Majesty.

1115
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,650
- I...
- Your Majesty!

1116
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,149
Your support has been crucial...

1117
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,289
- in getting me this far.
- I am flattered, Your Majesty.

1118
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,590
I will start my meal, so be quiet.

1119
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,460
- Enjoy your meal, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

1120
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,170
(Since we're in Andong, we should eat a lot of braised chicken.)

1121
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,639
(Devouring a chicken leg)

1122
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,040
You look sexy, Your Majesty.

1123
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,670
(A cry of satisfaction)

1124
00:37:30,671 --> 00:37:31,870
You're sexy, Your Majesty.

1125
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,939
(Love also gets a bite of Andong braised chicken.)

1126
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,109
He's mostly eating meat.

1127
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,110
(Moved)

1128
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,650
(Sweet and sour octopus salad always found at a feast in Andong)

1129
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,120
- It's salted pollack roe.
- Pollack roe?

1130
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,720
Pollack roe.

1131
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,589
(Exclaiming)

1132
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,860
Is it delicious, Your Majesty?

1133
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,259
(He continues to be impressed.)

1134
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,559
I've never tasted anything like it before.

1135
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,899
I'm very glad, Your Majesty.

1136
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,930
All the games I had played didn't go to waste.

1137
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,770
Is there anything else you'd like?

1138
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,410
I'd like to try some royal hot pot.

1139
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,910
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

1140
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,610
He's practically eating at the king's table.

1141
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,610
(Various seafood, meat, and vegetables were cooked in a broth.)

1142
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,320
(The ultimate dish in royal cuisine, royal hot pot)

1143
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,450
(Lots of beef)

1144
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,689
(Devouring a royal meal thanks to his nobleman)

1145
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,960
Your Majesty.

1146
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,630
Please try that meat with oysters on top.

1147
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,499
- When you try them together, - It will be amazing, Your Majesty.

1148
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,170
The best flavor will spread...

1149
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,039
all over the palate.

1150
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
(Korean galbi sanjeok and salted oysters)

1151
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:38,139
- Do you mean like this?
- Yes.

1152
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,170
Yes.

1153
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,180
Oh, my.

1154
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,480
I can smell oysters from here.

1155
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,720
(Andong Korean galbi sanjeok, a savor from the land)

1156
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,289
(Salted oysters, a flavor from the sea)

1157
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,359
Meat and oysters go well together.

1158
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,030
(It's a combination that always tastes good.)

1159
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1160
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,470
Lord Moon likes kimchi very much, Your Majesty.

1161
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,270
Will you describe the taste to me?

1162
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,709
If you bestow it on me,

1163
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,040
I cannot refuse.

1164
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,910
Go ahead. I look forward to it.

1165
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,210
Make it good enough to satisfy the viewers.

1166
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,379
Describe the taste.

1167
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,820
(Crying)

1168
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,680
- He's exaggerating.
- The taste of kimchi...

1169
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,050
It reminds me of Your Majesty's life.

1170
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,919
After being born like fresh kimchi,

1171
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,460
until you turned exquisite like aged kimchi,

1172
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,689
you made a tremendous amount of effort.

1173
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,100
You started as a farmhand and ended up on the throne.

1174
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,129
It tastes just like your life, Your Majesty.

1175
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,169
That's supposed to be a secret.

1176
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,700
Your Majesty doesn't like to hear it.

1177
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,900
Listen up.

1178
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,610
Yes, Your Majesty.

1179
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,070
- Punish him.
- Okay.

1180
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,739
Your Majesty.

1181
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,480
(Name of his sin: Bringing up his days as a farmhand)

1182
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,420
Your Majesty, we will make him ride a motorcycle.

1183
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
It hurts.

1184
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,090
Stop it.

1185
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,260
I do not like to hear about my past.

1186
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,059
Please forgive me.

1187
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,990
It was very difficult being a farmhand.

1188
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,860
I beg your kindness, Your Majesty.

1189
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,859
Please continue your meal.

1190
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,499
- It looks delicious.
- All right.

1191
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,170
- If it's okay with you...
- Yes?

1192
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,569
Who is he?

1193
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,940
He's a new servant, Your Majesty.

1194
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,469
- Listen up.
- Your Majesty?

1195
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,210
- Punish him.
- Why?

1196
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,880
- Punish him.
- Why?

1197
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,450
Punish him.

1198
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,080
Here we come.

1199
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,280
Punish him for now.

1200
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,220
Shall we make him ride a motorcycle too?

1201
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,020
Goodness.

1202
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,789
(Name of his sin: Interrupting the king's meal)

1203
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,860
Punish him for now.

1204
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,390
How dare you...

1205
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:38,489
How dare you explain...

1206
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,590
while Your Majesty is eating?

1207
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,900
- Why don't we hear him?
- Let's hear it.

1208
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,570
You became the king today.

1209
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,799
Why don't you play a game where the king gives to others?

1210
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,899
(A game where the king gives to others?)

1211
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,170
That sounds good.

1212
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,039
Why don't you play the king game to win food?

1213
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,269
- The king game?
- We prepared spoons.

1214
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,609
The king game?

1215
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,640
(The losers pick a spoon with a number on it.)

1216
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,009
You can say, "Number 1 and 3, eat japchae."

1217
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:03,680
(Numbers called by the king can eat based on his order.)

1218
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,090
Here you go.

1219
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,660
We don't get this chance every day.

1220
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,490
Cover your number.

1221
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,490
(Each of them takes one while covering it.)

1222
00:41:10,491 --> 00:41:11,730
Cover it.

1223
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,059
Let me take one.

1224
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,100
(The farmhands pick one carefully.)

1225
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,799
Your Majesty, we're ready.

1226
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,869
(Everyone picked one.)

1227
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,700
Which number... I mean, what do we start with?

1228
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,170
It's braised chicken.

1229
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,370
The braised chicken is the main dish.

1230
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,009
We'll start with a big one.

1231
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,570
(The king is generous.)

1232
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,680
I didn't get to eat it.

1233
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,310
He served himself first.

1234
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,050
- That punk...
- He's nothing without the king.

1235
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,179
- All right.
- That's it.

1236
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,420
(Andong braised chicken without chicken)

1237
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,249
Please call out the number.

1238
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,250
(It's time for King Joon to pick a number.)

1239
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,690
(Nervous)

1240
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,990
Number four.

1241
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,059
- Tell me your number.
- I'm number four.

1242
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,330
Jong Min, when did you switch?

1243
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,500
I didn't switch anything.

1244
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,530
Please pick one more person, Your Majesty.

1245
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,370
Please be generous with us.

1246
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,269
Number three.

1247
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,369
(Then number 3)

1248
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:00,440
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Please be kind one more time.

1249
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,939
- Let one more person eat.
- One more person.

1250
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,739
- Please stop.
- Number two.

1251
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,849
- I'm number 1.
- I'm number 2.

1252
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:06,850
(Number 2 is Jong Min.)

1253
00:42:06,851 --> 00:42:08,079
I'm number one.

1254
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,819
(Only Sae Ho is eliminated.)

1255
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,880
Two, three, four.

1256
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,490
The numbers are 2, 3, and 4.

1257
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:16,620
Hey, it's me before you.

1258
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,859
(Next is Number 3, Se Yoon.)

1259
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,100
Go away.

1260
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,259
- Why you...
- Right.

1261
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,800
Who do you think you are?

1262
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,370
Can he serve himself that much?

1263
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,740
Give me some more.

1264
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,469
Jong Min, give me some more.

1265
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:34,370
(When rice is mixed in the sauce, you reach paradise.)

1266
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,180
(Slurping)

1267
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,180
Gosh, how could it taste so good?

1268
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,950
(Jong Min who couldn't eat lunch)

1269
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:52,190
(Se Yoon who knows about food is captivated by the sauce.)

1270
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,060
- Try some.
- Can he serve himself that much?

1271
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,459
(Sae Ho who got eliminated only gets glass noodles.)

1272
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,599
What is this?

1273
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1274
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,440
Give me some more.

1275
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,070
That was a great meal, Your Majesty.

1276
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,769
- DinDin had the best meal.
- Well done.

1277
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,770
(The light eater finished a bowl of rice quickly.)

1278
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:08,939
It was amazing.

1279
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,539
Everyone, did you enjoy your meal?

1280
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,250
- Yes.
- Yes, we enjoyed it.

1281
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,179
- Tonight in Andong, - We must be going somewhere.

1282
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,219
A special festival will take place.

1283
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,020
- A festival?
- Once you get changed,

1284
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,819
we will set out.

1285
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,619
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

1286
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,629
(What kind of special festival will it be?)

1287
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:25,660
What could it be?

1288
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,260
- There must be something.
- What could it be?

1289
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:29,030
- There's something.
- What is it?

1290
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,830
Should we punish him?

1291
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,669
This has never happened before.

1292
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:33,729
Should we punish him?

1293
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:34,739
(Flustered)

1294
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,800
We probably should.

1295
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,939
- By the way, who are you?
- What?

1296
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,540
Is it over?

1297
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,880
- Who are you?
- Is it over so soon?

1298
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,979
- Your Majesty.
- What?

1299
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,550
- Are you happy?
- What?

1300
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,679
Did you feel ecstatic because we treated you like a king?

1301
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,419
- Come back to your senses.
- Is it over?

1302
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,719
Is it over this soon?

1303
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,950
You must have dreamt it.

1304
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,719
Did you play yutnori in your dream?

1305
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,620
- What...
- Were you a king in your dream?

1306
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,830
Did people call you King Joon?

1307
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,930
How could everyone's attitude change completely?

1308
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,469
What's happening to the roles we were playing?

1309
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,229
- The role-play isn't...
- Temporarily?

1310
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,639
- over yet. We're taking a break.
- Hey.

1311
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,469
- You rascal!
- Your Majesty.

1312
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,709
It's not over yet.

1313
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:15,739
Your Majesty, why you are getting angry all of a sudden?

1314
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,740
(Quickly calming down the king)

1315
00:44:16,741 --> 00:44:18,980
Be careful from now on.

1316
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,649
We will, Your Majesty.

1317
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:21,720
I was startled.

1318
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,319
We're going out for a minute.

1319
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,690
Where are we going right now?

1320
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,389
We're going to see something very rare.

1321
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,990
- See something rare?
- See something rare?

1322
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,090
It must be a rare festival that takes place only in Andong.

1323
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,160
Right.

1324
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,830
There's a hahoe mask festival where people perform with masks.

1325
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,069
It could be something like that.

1326
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:41,740
- With people wearing masks?
- Yes.

1327
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,839
It's something that can be done at night.

1328
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,439
It could be something with lights.

1329
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,079
- Right.
- What's easily seen at night.

1330
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,580
Will we be surprised by it?

1331
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:52,810
What could it be? There are many festivals in Andong.

1332
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,020
(Coming up soon)

1333
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,149
It's making me tear up. It looks so beautiful.

1334
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,390
It's a valuable experience.

1335
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:05,290
They look like starlight.

1336
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:09,060
(They will see a breathtaking scene before them.)

1337
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,283
(They arrive at the destination.)

1338
00:45:12,893 --> 00:45:16,062
(Where is this place the members have arrived at?)

1339
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:17,263
What place is this?

1340
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:19,333
I guess something will fly up there.

1341
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:22,933
I see some wires. I think it's a zipline.

1342
00:45:23,973 --> 00:45:25,202
(Will they ride a zipline at this hour?)

1343
00:45:25,203 --> 00:45:27,802
- Guys, we've come...
- Yes?

1344
00:45:27,803 --> 00:45:30,673
- to Hahoe Village in Andong.
- Yes.

1345
00:45:30,743 --> 00:45:33,842
The cliff behind you is called Buyongdae Cliff.

1346
00:45:33,843 --> 00:45:34,943
- Buyongdae Cliff?
- It's magnificent.

1347
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,682
(The cliff with magnificent rocks that stands...)

1348
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:42,423
(across the Nakdong River from Hahoe Village...)

1349
00:45:42,753 --> 00:45:45,923
(where you can see Hahoe Village at a glance)

1350
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:48,863
A while later,

1351
00:45:49,323 --> 00:45:51,163
a Joseon style firework event will be held here.

1352
00:45:52,093 --> 00:45:54,702
It's called Hahoe Seonyu Julbul Nori.

1353
00:45:54,703 --> 00:45:55,833
"Julbul Nori?"

1354
00:45:57,403 --> 00:46:01,042
Seonyu Julbul Nori is a graceful cultural event...

1355
00:46:01,043 --> 00:46:03,142
that our ancestors enjoyed since Joseon Dynasty.

1356
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:05,642
People wished for a bumper harvest and peace in the village through it.

1357
00:46:05,643 --> 00:46:07,412
It's our own cultural heritage.

1358
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:08,843
Really? Since Joseon Dynasty?

1359
00:46:09,243 --> 00:46:11,582
They prepared the event because the king would be here.

1360
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:12,712
That's right.

1361
00:46:12,713 --> 00:46:14,483
- It must be exhausting.
- A Joseon style firework event.

1362
00:46:15,353 --> 00:46:19,322
They prepared this event as a special event...

1363
00:46:19,323 --> 00:46:21,662
for our viewers who missed the event...

1364
00:46:21,663 --> 00:46:23,792
or who were not available to come all the way to Andong.

1365
00:46:23,793 --> 00:46:25,192
Thank you.

1366
00:46:25,193 --> 00:46:27,362
- I'm excited to see it.
- Let's all finish this year well,

1367
00:46:27,363 --> 00:46:30,902
and let's wish our viewers happiness and well-being.

1368
00:46:30,903 --> 00:46:32,432
- I understand.
- Of course.

1369
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:33,742
- I'll wish for their happiness.
- Okay.

1370
00:46:33,743 --> 00:46:36,402
Jong Min, the oldest cast member of 2 Days 1 Night...

1371
00:46:36,403 --> 00:46:38,112
- will start...
- For real?

1372
00:46:38,113 --> 00:46:39,712
- the firework event.
- That's great.

1373
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,143
- What? How?
- This is driving me crazy.

1374
00:46:41,513 --> 00:46:42,643
- Sounds great.
- How will he do that?

1375
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:45,052
- Now...
- That's such a big role to play.

1376
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:46,682
- It's an important role. Yes?
- Jong Min.

1377
00:46:46,683 --> 00:46:48,252
- Let's head to another place.
- He'll go somewhere?

1378
00:46:48,253 --> 00:46:50,922
- Will he ignite the fire?
- Will I fly with the fire?

1379
00:46:50,923 --> 00:46:52,522
- Jong Min, see you in a bit.
- That would be funny.

1380
00:46:52,523 --> 00:46:53,523
(We all know he can't do such a thing.)

1381
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:55,692
It's like the Summer Game torch relay.

1382
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:57,233
(Jong Min, the brave oldest member, heads to the ignition spot.)

1383
00:46:57,463 --> 00:46:59,863
I can't believe I'm going to begin the Julbul Nori.

1384
00:46:59,963 --> 00:47:02,762
It's a very important role to play. I feel burdened.

1385
00:47:02,763 --> 00:47:03,872
Will it be okay?

1386
00:47:03,873 --> 00:47:05,032
Oh, my. It's amazing.

1387
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:06,773
(The other members, Jong Min's ignition spot)

1388
00:47:06,873 --> 00:47:08,502
I've never seen this before in my life.

1389
00:47:08,503 --> 00:47:09,743
- Me neither. This is my first time.
- This is really...

1390
00:47:09,873 --> 00:47:12,643
- I've never even heard of it.
- It's a rare opportunity.

1391
00:47:13,273 --> 00:47:14,482
Oh, my. Julbul Nori...

1392
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:16,643
(Suddenly, all lights are turned off.)

1393
00:47:17,013 --> 00:47:19,052
(With complete darkness, )

1394
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:21,383
(the Julbul Nori is ready to begin.)

1395
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:24,822
I see Jong Min! Look at Jong Min.

1396
00:47:24,823 --> 00:47:26,953
- Where?
- Over there.

1397
00:47:27,293 --> 00:47:29,363
- He's holding the torch.
- Go for it!

1398
00:47:29,463 --> 00:47:31,133
Everyone,

1399
00:47:31,493 --> 00:47:33,362
the Julbul Nori has begun.

1400
00:47:33,363 --> 00:47:36,133
(Part 1: Julbul Nori)

1401
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:38,172
What? Will it start from there?

1402
00:47:38,173 --> 00:47:39,832
Guys, it's about to start.

1403
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:41,902
- How will he start it?
- What's going on?

1404
00:47:41,903 --> 00:47:43,603
Maybe they spread oil all over it.

1405
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:45,272
Really? Did they apply oil on it?

1406
00:47:45,273 --> 00:47:47,842
- Does it move along the wire?
- It's about to start.

1407
00:47:47,843 --> 00:47:49,143
(Full of excitement)

1408
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:50,512
Here we go!

1409
00:47:50,513 --> 00:47:52,752
(Filmed with cooperation of the fire department)

1410
00:47:52,753 --> 00:47:55,982
- We wish for your happiness.
- We wish for your happiness.

1411
00:47:55,983 --> 00:47:57,083
Light it up.

1412
00:47:57,593 --> 00:48:01,462
(He lights the first one up wishing for everyone's happiness)

1413
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:02,463
- Is it done?
- Yes.

1414
00:48:04,933 --> 00:48:06,893
- Light another one up?
- Yes.

1415
00:48:08,733 --> 00:48:11,872
(The lit-up charcoal bag...)

1416
00:48:11,873 --> 00:48:15,043
(slowly goes up along the wire.)

1417
00:48:15,703 --> 00:48:18,773
(One by one)

1418
00:48:19,643 --> 00:48:20,912
It works. The one Jong Min lit up is burning.

1419
00:48:20,913 --> 00:48:22,283
(With Jong Min's touch, )

1420
00:48:22,743 --> 00:48:25,282
Oh, look. The flame is going up.

1421
00:48:25,283 --> 00:48:27,753
(the flame meets the charcoal and burns upward.)

1422
00:48:28,883 --> 00:48:30,023
It's beautiful.

1423
00:48:30,653 --> 00:48:32,392
It'll be magnificent when it goes all the way up, right?

1424
00:48:32,393 --> 00:48:33,992
(They go up toward Buyongdae Cliff, ready to create a splendid sight.)

1425
00:48:33,993 --> 00:48:35,263
What... Oh, I guess it's supposed to fall off.

1426
00:48:35,523 --> 00:48:37,163
I guess flames fall like rain while those go up.

1427
00:48:40,193 --> 00:48:41,432
- It's really...
- Amazing.

1428
00:48:41,433 --> 00:48:45,802
(About 1,500 charcoal bags...)

1429
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:48,402
I'm getting goosebumps. It's so beautiful.

1430
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:49,572
Indeed.

1431
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:51,173
(About 1,500 charcoal bags create the Milky Way above the river.)

1432
00:48:51,573 --> 00:48:54,283
This is a priceless experience.

1433
00:48:54,343 --> 00:48:55,542
It's spectacular.

1434
00:48:55,543 --> 00:48:56,942
It's as if the stars fell like rain.

1435
00:48:56,943 --> 00:48:59,213
(It looks as if they were floating in space.)

1436
00:49:00,183 --> 00:49:01,353
It will be splendid.

1437
00:49:02,423 --> 00:49:03,523
Guys.

1438
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:04,823
- He's back.
- What?

1439
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:07,592
- Jong Min's is burning well.
- I lit a few up.

1440
00:49:07,593 --> 00:49:09,062
It looks like the aurora.

1441
00:49:09,063 --> 00:49:10,262
Where is mine?

1442
00:49:10,263 --> 00:49:11,592
- It's on the first wire.
- That one?

1443
00:49:11,593 --> 00:49:12,593
The first one is mine.

1444
00:49:13,593 --> 00:49:16,233
- It looks like CGI.
- Exactly.

1445
00:49:16,463 --> 00:49:17,603
Indeed.

1446
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:19,573
- It doesn't seem real.
- Right.

1447
00:49:19,903 --> 00:49:21,202
It looks like it's fake even though I'm looking at it.

1448
00:49:21,203 --> 00:49:22,472
- It looks like CGI.
- It doesn't seem real.

1449
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:23,913
(The flames move to Buyongdae Cliff pouring light like a waterfall.)

1450
00:49:25,773 --> 00:49:31,053
(They're watching this unfamiliar sight in fascination.)

1451
00:49:31,713 --> 00:49:32,852
This is awesome.

1452
00:49:32,853 --> 00:49:34,282
I'm tearing up.

1453
00:49:34,283 --> 00:49:35,722
- My, it's beautiful.
- Me too.

1454
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,182
- You know how it feels, right?
- Yes, I know.

1455
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,953
- It makes me want to cry.
- I'm getting teary-eyed.

1456
00:49:40,153 --> 00:49:41,993
It's becoming more splendid.

1457
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,492
- It's getting bigger.
- Stop filming us and look at that.

1458
00:49:44,493 --> 00:49:46,093
We don't get to see something like this every day.

1459
00:49:46,763 --> 00:49:48,033
It's spectacular.

1460
00:49:48,563 --> 00:49:49,962
It's becoming more and more amazing.

1461
00:49:49,963 --> 00:49:50,972
(As time passes...)

1462
00:49:50,973 --> 00:49:52,272
- My, it's pretty.
- It's pretty.

1463
00:49:52,273 --> 00:49:53,702
(The charcoal bags burn more intensely.)

1464
00:49:53,703 --> 00:49:54,703
It's beautiful.

1465
00:49:58,113 --> 00:50:01,083
(Viewers, enjoy the spectacle for a while.)

1466
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:03,183
It looks like the aurora.

1467
00:50:03,283 --> 00:50:05,453
- It's romantic.
- It's magnificent.

1468
00:50:07,653 --> 00:50:09,123
The flames look like they're dancing.

1469
00:50:10,793 --> 00:50:13,093
It looks as if the stars were falling.

1470
00:50:18,863 --> 00:50:20,663
They've been doing this since Joseon Dynasty?

1471
00:50:20,803 --> 00:50:22,033
- Exactly.
- That's amazing.

1472
00:50:23,203 --> 00:50:24,273
It's really magnificent.

1473
00:50:24,433 --> 00:50:25,833
I wonder who came up with the idea.

1474
00:50:25,933 --> 00:50:28,902
This is more atmospheric and beautiful than modern fireworks.

1475
00:50:28,903 --> 00:50:30,643
- It's romantic.
- And the way the flames fall.

1476
00:50:31,543 --> 00:50:33,173
This heals my mind.

1477
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,582
It creates a calm, peaceful mood.

1478
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:36,812
(The traditional fireworks melt our hearts with the soft light.)

1479
00:50:36,813 --> 00:50:37,853
Julbul Nori.

1480
00:50:42,283 --> 00:50:44,022
- It's so spectacular.
- It's beautiful.

1481
00:50:44,023 --> 00:50:46,492
The flames fall like rain. It's like lava.

1482
00:50:46,493 --> 00:50:47,822
- This is legendary.
- Amazing.

1483
00:50:47,823 --> 00:50:49,192
(The wind and Julbul, fire on the wire, create a splendid sight.)

1484
00:50:49,193 --> 00:50:51,563
- Lava rain is falling.
- Awesome.

1485
00:50:52,193 --> 00:50:54,362
It's like the stars falling.

1486
00:50:54,363 --> 00:50:55,963
It's literally beautiful.

1487
00:50:57,033 --> 00:50:59,103
- It's pretty.
- Oh, my. It's so beautiful.

1488
00:50:59,233 --> 00:51:01,773
- What are those down there?
- What are those?

1489
00:51:01,843 --> 00:51:03,802
- What are those?
- They're floating down the river.

1490
00:51:03,803 --> 00:51:06,042
Can you see those things that are floating down the river?

1491
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:07,642
- What are those?
- What are those flames?

1492
00:51:07,643 --> 00:51:10,283
(The glow on the water catches everyone's eye.)

1493
00:51:12,213 --> 00:51:14,123
(Part 2: Egg Fireworks)

1494
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,722
Egg Fireworks are an event where you light an eggshell on fire...

1495
00:51:19,723 --> 00:51:21,523
and set the eggshell lantern afloat on the river.

1496
00:51:21,723 --> 00:51:23,162
My, it's pretty.

1497
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,833
How beautiful. They're flickering.

1498
00:51:25,493 --> 00:51:28,032
Why don't you make a wish?

1499
00:51:28,033 --> 00:51:30,203
We'll give you eggshell lanterns.

1500
00:51:30,873 --> 00:51:33,473
(Filling it with positive energy)

1501
00:51:35,003 --> 00:51:37,843
(What did everyone wish for?)

1502
00:51:38,543 --> 00:51:42,542
I wish the viewers happiness and well-being.

1503
00:51:42,543 --> 00:51:43,613
He's spinning it while moving.

1504
00:51:43,783 --> 00:51:46,882
Dear viewers, I hope your days...

1505
00:51:46,883 --> 00:51:49,923
will be filled with joy and happiness.

1506
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:54,663
I wish all those who love our show happiness and good health.

1507
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,533
Good health is the best.

1508
00:51:57,593 --> 00:51:58,993
Always stay healthy.

1509
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:02,802
I hope our show will be the place...

1510
00:52:02,803 --> 00:52:04,633
where you can rest in a busy life.

1511
00:52:04,733 --> 00:52:06,173
2 Days 1 Night.

1512
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:08,843
Everyone in the 2 Days 1 Night family.

1513
00:52:08,973 --> 00:52:10,813
I love you. Always be happy.

1514
00:52:13,443 --> 00:52:15,412
(I wish the viewers happiness and well-being.)

1515
00:52:15,413 --> 00:52:17,242
(Good health is the best. Always stay healthy.)

1516
00:52:17,243 --> 00:52:20,213
(They wrote down their wishes with their honest hearts.)

1517
00:52:22,053 --> 00:52:23,222
We've set them all afloat.

1518
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,223
(Our wishes float down the Nakdong River.)

1519
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,723
Our wishes will come true.

1520
00:52:27,153 --> 00:52:28,162
(Please make my wish come true.)

1521
00:52:28,163 --> 00:52:29,163
It's moving well.

1522
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:33,292
They look like ducks.

1523
00:52:33,293 --> 00:52:34,562
(They look like a flock of cute ducks from here.)

1524
00:52:34,563 --> 00:52:35,803
Go.

1525
00:52:36,533 --> 00:52:38,403
- Goodbye.
- Go and make my wish come true.

1526
00:52:38,603 --> 00:52:39,702
Make my wish come true.

1527
00:52:39,703 --> 00:52:40,973
(We hope all your wishes written on the lanterns will come true.)

1528
00:52:42,043 --> 00:52:45,572
(As the Julbul and eggshell lanterns fill the place with splendor...)

1529
00:52:45,573 --> 00:52:46,573
What?

1530
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:51,052
What's going on?

1531
00:52:51,053 --> 00:52:54,623
(Scholars enjoy music on a boat floating on the river.)

1532
00:52:55,323 --> 00:52:56,723
I think he's reciting a poem.

1533
00:52:57,853 --> 00:52:58,953
A poem.

1534
00:53:00,353 --> 00:53:01,692
- Did people do that in the past?
- Yes.

1535
00:53:01,693 --> 00:53:03,723
(Part 3: Seonyu Nori)

1536
00:53:04,963 --> 00:53:06,732
(People enjoyed writing and reciting poems...)

1537
00:53:06,733 --> 00:53:08,533
(in the midst of a beautiful scenery.)

1538
00:53:12,103 --> 00:53:14,372
(By adding music and dance, )

1539
00:53:14,373 --> 00:53:18,113
(they indulged themselves with fun on a boat.)

1540
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:24,383
(Dancing)

1541
00:53:26,153 --> 00:53:27,213
This is so nice.

1542
00:53:28,923 --> 00:53:31,753
(They're being absorbed in the scholars' cheery energy.)

1543
00:53:35,423 --> 00:53:37,632
This is how people had fun in Joseon Dynasty.

1544
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:38,663
(A boat ride under fireworks is how scholars enjoyed themselves.)

1545
00:53:41,403 --> 00:53:42,403
Thank you!

1546
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:45,202
That was amazing!

1547
00:53:45,203 --> 00:53:47,403
(Julbul Nori reaches its climax as the music fades out.)

1548
00:53:48,943 --> 00:53:52,413
(Part 4: Nakhwa Nori)

1549
00:53:54,213 --> 00:53:56,242
Shout "Nakhwa" all together,

1550
00:53:56,243 --> 00:53:59,383
and a beautiful flower will fall, which is a spectacular sight.

1551
00:54:00,683 --> 00:54:01,822
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

1552
00:54:01,823 --> 00:54:04,053
- Nakhwa!
- Nakhwa!

1553
00:54:04,823 --> 00:54:06,823
- Nakhwa!
- Nakhwa!

1554
00:54:06,893 --> 00:54:08,993
- Nakhwa!
- Nakhwa!

1555
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:12,363
- Nakhwa!
- Nakhwa!

1556
00:54:13,093 --> 00:54:14,533
Nakhwa!

1557
00:54:17,903 --> 00:54:18,933
Oh, my. What's that?

1558
00:54:20,403 --> 00:54:23,443
(Nakhwa, falling flower)

1559
00:54:28,543 --> 00:54:29,643
Oh, my. What is that?

1560
00:54:31,153 --> 00:54:33,412
(Although it's brief, the splendor will be remembered forever.)

1561
00:54:33,413 --> 00:54:34,583
It's magnificent.

1562
00:54:35,653 --> 00:54:38,152
- Nakhwa!
- Nakhwa!

1563
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:39,192
(They shout "Nakhwa" again as they're sad it ended.)

1564
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,023
- Nakhwa!
- Nakhwa!

1565
00:54:42,123 --> 00:54:43,663
Nakhwa!

1566
00:54:51,933 --> 00:54:54,033
It's like a flickering light. It moves like this.

1567
00:54:55,273 --> 00:54:56,443
- From a distance...
- Goodness.

1568
00:54:57,103 --> 00:54:59,043
(This is the highlight.)

1569
00:55:00,513 --> 00:55:01,783
- What's that?
- Goodness.

1570
00:55:01,983 --> 00:55:03,882
(A stunning scene of fire ropes and falling embers...)

1571
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,783
(creating a rain of sparks)

1572
00:55:08,653 --> 00:55:09,782
What is that?

1573
00:55:09,783 --> 00:55:11,192
- Goodness.
- Oh, my. What's that?

1574
00:55:11,193 --> 00:55:12,352
It's amazing.

1575
00:55:12,353 --> 00:55:13,353
(Totally mesmerized)

1576
00:55:15,123 --> 00:55:17,022
Yes, this is how it should be.

1577
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:18,232
(The night of Andong, a grand finale that leaves the city...)

1578
00:55:18,233 --> 00:55:19,393
(in utter enchantment)

1579
00:55:21,163 --> 00:55:22,432
(Beautiful lights filling the river and the sky)

1580
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:23,632
It would have been a great party if they started this...

1581
00:55:23,633 --> 00:55:24,832
since the Joseon Dynasty.

1582
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:25,903
I know.

1583
00:55:27,233 --> 00:55:28,473
It's so sparkling.

1584
00:55:29,903 --> 00:55:31,542
This is the beauty of Andong.

1585
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:33,012
(A refined spirit and timeless grace carried across generations)

1586
00:55:33,013 --> 00:55:34,013
- It's beautiful.
- Goodness.

1587
00:55:34,013 --> 00:55:35,013
That is...

1588
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:38,552
(Leaving this beautiful night with a deep and lasting afterglow)

1589
00:55:38,553 --> 00:55:40,782
- This is so pretty.
- What a magnificent scene!

1590
00:55:40,783 --> 00:55:41,823
(Leaving this beautiful night with a deep and lasting afterglow)

1591
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:46,723
(Remembering Julbul Nori, December, 2025)

1592
00:55:46,923 --> 00:55:49,563
It was something we could watch without thinking.

1593
00:55:50,523 --> 00:55:51,633
I was so happy.

1594
00:55:52,363 --> 00:55:53,893
It was splendid.

1595
00:55:54,163 --> 00:55:55,603
It was superb.

1596
00:55:55,703 --> 00:55:56,832
It was breathtaking.

1597
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:58,702
I would definitely come back just for this.

1598
00:55:58,703 --> 00:56:00,872
It would be so nice to come back with families and kids.

1599
00:56:00,873 --> 00:56:01,873
- I know.
- Couples can come too.

1600
00:56:01,874 --> 00:56:03,473
It was like...

1601
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:06,412
It's like I just went to a wonderland.

1602
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:07,883
It felt like I was in a fairy tale.

1603
00:56:08,413 --> 00:56:10,713
Honestly, it was prettier than the Northern Lights in Finland.

1604
00:56:10,913 --> 00:56:12,983
But in reality, I'm only a farmhand.

1605
00:56:13,483 --> 00:56:14,753
I know the reality is horrible.

1606
00:56:15,053 --> 00:56:17,922
I was like, "It's wonderful!"

1607
00:56:17,923 --> 00:56:20,852
What else do we have to do? It's getting late.

1608
00:56:20,853 --> 00:56:22,993
I think we should sleep soon.

1609
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,563
Next, we are...

1610
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:26,592
It's only 10pm. What do you mean you want to sleep?

1611
00:56:26,593 --> 00:56:27,593
(King Joon is still hungry.)

1612
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:29,333
What about this?

1613
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,073
Civilians...

1614
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:32,902
Have they ever tried to revolt?

1615
00:56:32,903 --> 00:56:34,133
There was some sort of revolt.

1616
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:36,343
You want to revolt?

1617
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:38,572
Don't even think about it.

1618
00:56:38,573 --> 00:56:40,012
(Warning: Don't even think about rising in revolt.)

1619
00:56:40,013 --> 00:56:41,312
You will all die.

1620
00:56:41,313 --> 00:56:42,382
(I won't let you do that.)

1621
00:56:42,383 --> 00:56:44,482
Do you know the movie, "The Night Owl?"

1622
00:56:44,483 --> 00:56:45,483
(DinDin wouldn't stop talking even when Joon warned him.)

1623
00:56:45,484 --> 00:56:47,112
The guy kills the king while giving acupuncture.

1624
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:48,123
How dare you!

1625
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:49,652
That's the story of King Jeongjo.

1626
00:56:49,653 --> 00:56:51,293
The assassins approached him...

1627
00:56:51,693 --> 00:56:52,793
to kill King Jeongjo.

1628
00:56:53,153 --> 00:56:55,363
I'm sure the kings were anxious too.

1629
00:56:55,463 --> 00:56:56,693
- Of course.
- Of course.

1630
00:56:57,193 --> 00:56:59,592
- They should have been nice.
- I know.

1631
00:56:59,593 --> 00:57:00,933
(Can King Joon secure the throne?)

1632
00:57:01,033 --> 00:57:02,702
2 Days 1 Night.

1633
00:57:02,703 --> 00:57:04,633
- Should we remove this? No?
- All right.

1634
00:57:04,773 --> 00:57:06,433
Does it start again as we get in?

1635
00:57:07,103 --> 00:57:08,942
- I don't think so.
- No.

1636
00:57:08,943 --> 00:57:10,142
Come on.

1637
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,742
I just saw the inside.

1638
00:57:11,743 --> 00:57:13,543
(I just saw what was inside.)

1639
00:57:13,813 --> 00:57:14,983
What? What is this?

1640
00:57:16,443 --> 00:57:18,813
- Isn't this a hut?
- A hut?

1641
00:57:19,683 --> 00:57:21,122
Is this where farmhands sleep?

1642
00:57:21,123 --> 00:57:23,152
Isn't this almost like sleeping outdoors?

1643
00:57:23,153 --> 00:57:24,793
- This is sleeping outdoors.
- It's where farmhands sleep.

1644
00:57:24,823 --> 00:57:27,553
You didn't give us a chance to switch our status.

1645
00:57:28,093 --> 00:57:29,363
You want us to sleep here?

1646
00:57:29,823 --> 00:57:30,992
- Yes.
- How do we...

1647
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:32,132
Just the farmhands?

1648
00:57:32,133 --> 00:57:33,462
This is where farmhands sleep.

1649
00:57:33,463 --> 00:57:35,602
You didn't give us a chance to switch our status.

1650
00:57:35,603 --> 00:57:37,662
- I'm the king.
- You want us to sleep here?

1651
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,332
Yes, you will sleep here.

1652
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:41,642
You can get up when the morning song gets played.

1653
00:57:41,643 --> 00:57:42,742
- Okay.
- What?

1654
00:57:42,743 --> 00:57:44,572
Sleep well.

1655
00:57:44,573 --> 00:57:46,472
- I'll see you tomorrow morning.
- No more games?

1656
00:57:46,473 --> 00:57:47,743
Is this the end?

1657
00:57:48,243 --> 00:57:49,412
This is the end?

1658
00:57:49,413 --> 00:57:50,742
(Whispering)

1659
00:57:50,743 --> 00:57:52,312
Really?

1660
00:57:52,313 --> 00:57:53,483
He asked, "Should we beat him up?"

1661
00:57:53,713 --> 00:57:54,952
What's happening?

1662
00:57:54,953 --> 00:57:57,483
- Let's revolt or something.
- What is this?

1663
00:57:57,723 --> 00:57:59,552
We're going to revolt.

1664
00:57:59,553 --> 00:58:02,193
- You can get ready to sleep.
- Is this for real?

1665
00:58:02,793 --> 00:58:03,793
(Screaming)

1666
00:58:03,794 --> 00:58:05,533
(Screaming)

1667
00:58:05,663 --> 00:58:07,032
- I just need to ask you this.
- Yes?

1668
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:08,803
Can the king and his help get in?

1669
00:58:09,233 --> 00:58:11,303
- That's right.
- Do we even have a king here?

1670
00:58:11,503 --> 00:58:13,602
Joon is back to his nobleman status.

1671
00:58:13,603 --> 00:58:14,973
- I'm just a nobleman?
- Yes.

1672
00:58:15,003 --> 00:58:17,572
- What? How come?
- It's not even important.

1673
00:58:17,573 --> 00:58:18,743
It's important for me to be a king.

1674
00:58:18,973 --> 00:58:21,512
- Stop it now.
- My status...

1675
00:58:21,513 --> 00:58:23,582
It got really cold tonight.

1676
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,213
I don't know how many weeks I have slept outdoors.

1677
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:27,482
There are times like that.

1678
00:58:27,483 --> 00:58:28,752
- But we also sleep indoors.
- I mean...

1679
00:58:28,753 --> 00:58:31,092
This looks great on the outside.

1680
00:58:31,093 --> 00:58:32,852
Jong Hyun, can we just get in?

1681
00:58:32,853 --> 00:58:33,922
Yes, you can get inside.

1682
00:58:33,923 --> 00:58:35,122
You want us to get out when the morning song gets played?

1683
00:58:35,123 --> 00:58:36,123
- Yes.
- That's great.

1684
00:58:36,124 --> 00:58:38,593
It's very neat here.

1685
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:41,703
How come I'm not a king anymore?

1686
00:58:41,733 --> 00:58:43,902
- We'll treat you like a king.
- Sure.

1687
00:58:43,903 --> 00:58:45,232
You can sleep here, Your Majesty.

1688
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:47,032
- I see.
- Your Majesty.

1689
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:50,543
Let me get on the floor, goodness.

1690
00:58:50,773 --> 00:58:52,442
- Do we just sleep here?
- Yes.

1691
00:58:52,443 --> 00:58:55,213
Then we can sleep here together.

1692
00:58:55,843 --> 00:58:56,843
What's with your mouth?

1693
00:58:56,844 --> 00:58:58,553
Why are you accepting this?

1694
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:01,653
Why are you taking it as it is?

1695
00:59:01,823 --> 00:59:02,823
We are just farmhands.

1696
00:59:02,824 --> 00:59:05,153
Why are you accepting this?

1697
00:59:05,723 --> 00:59:08,522
We will die if we sleep here when it's this cold.

1698
00:59:08,523 --> 00:59:09,563
(The first sub-zero outdoor night stay of the year)

1699
00:59:10,263 --> 00:59:11,492
Gosh, I have to sleep in the middle.

1700
00:59:11,493 --> 00:59:12,493
(The farmhands got inside the hut.)

1701
00:59:12,494 --> 00:59:14,433
- But the middle feels so cold.
- Isn't it better on the edge?

1702
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:16,932
(The noblemen are also getting ready to sleep.)

1703
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:18,402
- What?
- This won't close.

1704
00:59:18,403 --> 00:59:20,333
- This won't close.
- What do you mean?

1705
00:59:20,533 --> 00:59:23,142
- Do you like where you're sleeping?
- What's going on?

1706
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,542
- What's happening?
- Do you like it here?

1707
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,543
(Why is Director Joo asking whether they like it here or not?)

1708
00:59:25,544 --> 00:59:27,512
What are you up to? Get out of here if you're fooling around.

1709
00:59:27,513 --> 00:59:28,713
What's wrong with you?

1710
00:59:29,243 --> 00:59:30,342
- What?
- I mean...

1711
00:59:30,343 --> 00:59:31,953
- You can sleep here.
- Okay.

1712
00:59:32,183 --> 00:59:35,553
You shouldn't let your farmhands run away in the middle of the night.

1713
00:59:36,783 --> 00:59:38,692
You never know what will happen.

1714
00:59:38,693 --> 00:59:41,292
You should manage your own farmhands.

1715
00:59:41,293 --> 00:59:43,963
- You can go to bed now.
- It's like "The Slave Hunters."

1716
00:59:44,393 --> 00:59:45,393
(Something is happening during the night.)

1717
00:59:45,394 --> 00:59:46,733
Something is happening.

1718
00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:48,163
I'll see you tomorrow.

1719
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:50,332
Hold on a second.

1720
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:52,072
Give us more hints.

1721
00:59:52,073 --> 00:59:53,932
But this is all I can tell you.

1722
00:59:53,933 --> 00:59:55,573
- I just have one last question.
- Okay.

1723
00:59:56,403 --> 00:59:57,803
Do we get to sleep at all?

1724
00:59:57,943 --> 00:59:59,013
Of course.

1725
00:59:59,213 --> 01:00:01,743
You can sleep as long as your farmhands don't run away.

1726
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:04,812
- You want us to stand guard?
- Keep an eye on your farmhands.

1727
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:05,883
And you can sleep.

1728
01:00:06,013 --> 01:00:07,813
This doesn't sound right.

1729
01:00:08,253 --> 01:00:10,183
Anything could happen.

1730
01:00:10,553 --> 01:00:11,893
This means we can't sleep.

1731
01:00:12,153 --> 01:00:14,252
May I say goodnight to my farmhand?

1732
01:00:14,253 --> 01:00:16,093
To your farmhand? Of course.

1733
01:00:16,563 --> 01:00:17,792
My gosh, this is...

1734
01:00:17,793 --> 01:00:19,093
- Airhead.
- Yes, my lord.

1735
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:20,692
May I help you?

1736
01:00:20,693 --> 01:00:21,863
Choraeng.

1737
01:00:22,303 --> 01:00:23,562
Airhead, step out for a second.

1738
01:00:23,563 --> 01:00:26,172
- My feet are freezing.
- All right, I need a minute.

1739
01:00:26,173 --> 01:00:28,172
- Please let me sleep.
- Come on.

1740
01:00:28,173 --> 01:00:29,302
(The farmhands have no idea what's happening.)

1741
01:00:29,303 --> 01:00:30,473
Airhead.

1742
01:00:30,643 --> 01:00:32,373
When there is nobody around,

1743
01:00:33,073 --> 01:00:35,743
we can still be friends.

1744
01:00:36,043 --> 01:00:37,182
- Come on.
- What is up with you, my lord?

1745
01:00:37,183 --> 01:00:39,952
I just called you Airhead when people were around.

1746
01:00:39,953 --> 01:00:40,953
(Consoling the disappointed farmhand)

1747
01:00:40,954 --> 01:00:43,452
Just don't let it get to you. You can call me Sae Ho.

1748
01:00:43,453 --> 01:00:45,953
- Come on.
- We have always been friends.

1749
01:00:46,323 --> 01:00:47,892
Don't hold grudges.

1750
01:00:47,893 --> 01:00:49,962
- You are up to something.
- No, I mean it.

1751
01:00:49,963 --> 01:00:51,732
- No, it's not like that.
- You're going to beat me.

1752
01:00:51,733 --> 01:00:53,732
I don't beat my farmhand.

1753
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,202
Just sleep well tonight.

1754
01:00:56,203 --> 01:00:57,632
Trust me.

1755
01:00:57,633 --> 01:00:59,172
You can just trust me.

1756
01:00:59,173 --> 01:01:00,373
- Really?
- Yes.

1757
01:01:00,803 --> 01:01:03,343
You know how much I care about you.

1758
01:01:03,573 --> 01:01:04,772
(He just sounded like some ex-boyfriend.)

1759
01:01:04,773 --> 01:01:06,013
Let's see.

1760
01:01:06,643 --> 01:01:08,982
I think he will backstab me.

1761
01:01:08,983 --> 01:01:10,543
(Confessing his love to someone who is about to sleep)

1762
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:12,853
- What's with the noblemen?
- What has got into them?

1763
01:01:13,013 --> 01:01:14,182
What's wrong with them?

1764
01:01:14,183 --> 01:01:15,223
(The farmhands realize how noblemen are being suspicious.)

1765
01:01:15,323 --> 01:01:17,283
- They are up to something.
- I know.

1766
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:20,152
- We won't get to sleep.
- They are up to something for sure.

1767
01:01:20,153 --> 01:01:21,823
Something is going on.

1768
01:01:22,493 --> 01:01:24,493
I don't think they are aware.

1769
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:26,633
I hope Airhead doesn't do anything.

1770
01:01:27,363 --> 01:01:28,763
What's with your crown?

1771
01:01:29,863 --> 01:01:32,103
- I'll sleep with this.
- Stop obsessing with that.

1772
01:01:32,133 --> 01:01:34,402
- I'm the king.
- My gosh.

1773
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:35,573
You aren't the real king.

1774
01:01:35,903 --> 01:01:37,573
You have no idea how hard I worked to be a king.

1775
01:01:37,773 --> 01:01:38,973
How?

1776
01:01:39,273 --> 01:01:41,243
You are a funny man.

1777
01:01:41,313 --> 01:01:44,213
- What?
- Your outfit, I love it.

1778
01:01:44,883 --> 01:01:47,652
(Crazy Idol King Joon San)

1779
01:01:47,653 --> 01:01:48,883
When would he ever get to wear that?

1780
01:01:48,953 --> 01:01:50,482
I will buy you one.

1781
01:01:50,483 --> 01:01:53,122
(What on earth will happen tonight?)

1782
01:01:53,123 --> 01:01:54,393
I'm falling asleep.

1783
01:01:54,723 --> 01:01:57,923
Please step out for a second.

1784
01:02:00,693 --> 01:02:03,363
- Okay, something is happening.
- He is up to something.

1785
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:06,519
- Hurry up.
- Something is happening.

1786
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,930
(Calling the farmhands outside the main gate)

1787
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,629
I know how disappointed you are as you have to be the farmhands.

1788
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,429
- Yes, I'm disappointed.
- I'm disappointed the whole day!

1789
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:13,730
- I'm so disappointed.
- It's so unfair for me!

1790
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:17,030
For just 30 minutes,

1791
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,569
Night of the Manhunt will happen.

1792
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,169
(Surprise mission, Night of the Manhunt)

1793
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,809
- Night of the Manhunt?
- How do we do this?

1794
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:24,410
- Do we have to run away?
- We have to run away then.

1795
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,939
When the Night of the Manhunt starts,

1796
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,410
you can shout out like this. "I’m so glad I can run away!"

1797
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,980
You have to shout out in the tone of the character.

1798
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,849
You remember where we played the random mission?

1799
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:36,390
You will see the yamen when you run towards there.

1800
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,989
(Main gate)

1801
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:44,029
The main gate will be closed. You have to open it.

1802
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:47,330
(The gate is locked. They have to open it.)

1803
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:48,929
As you run to the yamen...

1804
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:53,040
(They have to get away from the yard and run towards the yamen.)

1805
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,609
Then you will see some identification tags.

1806
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:56,870
(You can find the identification tags of the noblemen.)

1807
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,079
You can write down your name...

1808
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,780
on your nobleman's tag.

1809
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:05,180
You can then instantly switch your status and where you sleep.

1810
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,389
- I have to write on my nobleman's?
- That's right.

1811
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:10,319
You can't write for somebody else.

1812
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,359
You can only write your own name.

1813
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,719
Then we should help...

1814
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,329
- each other write on the tags.
- That's right.

1815
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,889
You will fail this mission if you get caught...

1816
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:19,899
by your noblemen before you write your names on the tags.

1817
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,829
- I'll never get caught.
- Me neither.

1818
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:22,930
Isn't this too easy?

1819
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:25,169
They will be on their guard.

1820
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:26,870
Well, everyone...

1821
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,840
This is for you.

1822
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:32,009
These are your bells.

1823
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,239
You can wear them.

1824
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,279
(Farmhands must wear the bells.)

1825
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,380
I don't know where the yamen is. I'm bad with directions.

1826
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,119
- Shout out as loud as you can.
- "I'm so glad I can run away!"

1827
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,419
You have to let them hear it.

1828
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,190
- All right.
- You have to be fair.

1829
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:42,889
(The announcement for the farmhands is over.)

1830
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:45,120
You have to put this on your forehead.

1831
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:48,260
This is your headband.

1832
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:52,160
You have to wear them when you go in.

1833
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,199
- Okay.
- When do we start?

1834
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,230
You can plan the strategy when you go in.

1835
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:00,400
Do they know that we're doing this?

1836
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:03,769
We're just going to tell them to take care...

1837
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,440
- of their farmhands well.
- Amazing.

1838
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,650
(King Joon Sang watched the farmhands receive the notice.)

1839
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:12,120
- Lord.
- Yes?

1840
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,490
- I've got some amazing information.
- You do?

1841
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,119
- What is it?
- The three farmhands...

1842
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,459
are out getting a notice by the production crew.

1843
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,489
Okay.

1844
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:22,060
I think they're going to run away soon.

1845
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,700
- Remember the bells?
- Yes.

1846
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,329
The bells that make noise when you move will be on their ankles.

1847
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:30,470
They're giving those out to them. They'll wear them here.

1848
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:32,999
But the bells are louder than you think.

1849
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,040
The problem is...

1850
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,469
that you can't hear them when the door is closed.

1851
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:38,679
Let's open it.

1852
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,650
If you open the door, it would be the same as being out.

1853
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,079
It's actually...

1854
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,920
- We're actually outdoors.
- This is the outdoors.

1855
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:46,379
We at least have lights.

1856
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,680
Let's make our move.

1857
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,319
If we fail this time, we're as good as dead.

1858
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,220
We have to work together.

1859
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:55,459
The Night of the Manhunt will go on for just 30 minutes.

1860
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,990
All right. Let's do this!

1861
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,500
We'll begin moving.

1862
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:01,130
Goodnight, everyone!

1863
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:02,569
Okay!

1864
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:04,670
(The Night of the Manhunt begins.)

1865
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,769
Goodnight, everyone!

1866
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,470
They're a bit far away.

1867
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:09,869
They're coming.

1868
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:10,969
(They notice the farmhands returning.)

1869
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:13,440
Act like you don't know.

1870
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,050
He's entering the tent.

1871
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,210
Why aren't you sleeping?

1872
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:17,780
We're about to sleep.

1873
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,550
Do you want me to give you a lot of work...

1874
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,149
if you're not going to sleep? Are you not sleepy?

1875
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:23,519
We're sleepy.

1876
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,589
- Are you not sleepy?
- I'm dying to sleep.

1877
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:26,660
Let's go to bed.

1878
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,430
How cold.

1879
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,359
- It's cold.
- It's cold.

1880
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,659
It's so cold today.

1881
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,469
How am I supposed to sleep here?

1882
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:37,299
I have a good idea.

1883
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,440
Yes.

1884
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,069
I have a good idea.

1885
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,210
That's it.

1886
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,610
Their shoes are outside.

1887
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,939
If we hide their shoes,

1888
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:48,209
- Goodness.
- we can get time to run...

1889
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:50,209
- and they wouldn't catch us.
- Goodness.

1890
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:53,450
So go in and say goodnight.

1891
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:56,120
Also say,

1892
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:58,360
"One of you will never sleep again."

1893
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:01,559
If you say that, they'll be out of their minds.

1894
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,190
While they're confused, you can hide their shoes underneath.

1895
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:05,300
- Do we go after that?
- I don't have a strategy.

1896
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,730
We just have to run as fast as we can.

1897
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:09,830
We can't do anything.

1898
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:12,169
We can only do things here.

1899
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:13,669
- Okay.
- We can place a board...

1900
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,469
on the door so they can't open it.

1901
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:16,870
That's all we can do.

1902
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:18,479
Hiding their shoes...

1903
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,609
(He sensed someone's presence.)

1904
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:20,610
Hey.

1905
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:22,750
There's someone next to us.

1906
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:25,749
Let's sleep.

1907
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,379
- Let's first sleep.
- Let's not cause trouble...

1908
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,449
for one of them...

1909
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:30,749
and just sleep.

1910
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,089
Let's just pick one person.

1911
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:34,259
But the way I see it,

1912
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,159
- we can just close this and sleep, - Yes.

1913
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,999
- Is that better?
- and that would be better...

1914
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,760
- than chasing one of them out.
- That's more efficient.

1915
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,730
Should we go out and vote?

1916
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:43,630
For that one person?

1917
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:45,900
- It's not now.
- It's not?

1918
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:48,609
Later, when they're sleeping, we can go and vote.

1919
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:49,710
Okay.

1920
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,579
Think this through.

1921
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,080
(Let's see who's listening.)

1922
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,880
I should go to the bathroom.

1923
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,279
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

1924
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,549
- Goodness.
- What are you doing here?

1925
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:01,620
Goodness.

1926
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:02,889
- Goodness.
- Are you here to listen...

1927
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:04,090
to the voice of the people?

1928
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,560
- Goodness.
- The voice of the people.

1929
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,030
- What's going on?
- Hurry and sleep.

1930
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,659
(Lord Cho)

1931
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,830
Lord Cho.

1932
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,100
- It's so noisy. I can't sleep.
- Okay.

1933
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:18,269
- Aren't you going to sleep?
- We should sleep.

1934
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:21,099
Goodness. I can't sleep.

1935
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,210
Your majesty.

1936
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,470
Your majesty.

1937
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:27,540
Come here for a bit.

1938
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,250
Yes. Have you been well?

1939
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:32,449
Did you hear what we said?

1940
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:33,780
I heard everything.

1941
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,849
- You heard us?
- Yes.

1942
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:39,120
- All right.
- Think well. You're next.

1943
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,119
- I'll just...
- Go sleep.

1944
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,130
Go and sleep.

1945
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,160
- Sleep well.
- You can sleep well, right?

1946
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,959
I just need to save myself.

1947
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,369
Okay.

1948
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:50,429
- I'll just go and...
- Go and sleep.

1949
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:51,670
- sleep.
- Okay.

1950
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,270
If someone hears...

1951
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,110
Come inside, Lord Lee.

1952
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:58,210
I won't speak to them...

1953
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,309
of our conversations here.

1954
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:01,910
You'll be suspected if you stay too long.

1955
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:03,910
You'll be suspected. Go quickly.

1956
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:06,919
- Go inside.
- I'll save you.

1957
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,290
Thank you.

1958
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:14,320
(King Joon Sang was fooled by the farmhands.)

1959
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:17,559
I've come to say goodnight for the last time.

1960
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,559
Goodnight.

1961
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,100
Yes, goodnight.

1962
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:28,670
(He hid their shoes according to their plan.)

1963
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:30,439
- He hid them.
- He hid them.

1964
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,640
He did it.

1965
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,680
We can go now.

1966
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:37,949
(All they need to do now is run away!)

1967
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:38,950
Goodnight.

1968
01:08:38,951 --> 01:08:40,450
I'll get going now.

1969
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,190
Let's run as soon as he gets back.

1970
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:46,920
(They'll start as soon as Seon Ho returns!)

1971
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,490
He's out.

1972
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:51,160
Wear your shoes now.

1973
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,730
Let's run right now.

1974
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,370
They're all lying down, right?

1975
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:57,530
- Sae Ho isn't lying down.
- Where is he now?

1976
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,200
The weather is quite warm.

1977
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,539
(Lord Cho comes outside.)

1978
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,610
Goodness.

1979
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,580
What is it?

1980
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,720
Why are you minding me?

1981
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:14,419
You have a talent for making people uncomfortable.

1982
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:16,850
Why are you peeping out?

1983
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:23,760
(The person who is most bothered about this situation)

1984
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:27,200
(Jong Min, the farmhand of Lord Cho)

1985
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:30,000
- No.
- It's quite warm.

1986
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:31,370
We have to run now.

1987
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,470
No. I'll get caught by Sae Ho.

1988
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,239
(Then...)

1989
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,440
Could you stop him?

1990
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,950
Will you open the gate while we stop him?

1991
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:46,720
You have to open the gate.

1992
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,219
- We'll stop him.
- That way,

1993
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:51,560
you'll be far away from Sae Ho.

1994
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,460
Before Joon and Se Yoon come out,

1995
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,229
you'll open the gate,

1996
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:57,690
- That's faster.
- and we'll leave.

1997
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:00,560
- We all die if you betray us.
- Okay.

1998
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:03,399
(But...)

1999
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,740
- Hey.
- Yes?

2000
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,040
- I think they have something.
- What?

2001
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:11,779
"You have to run away within 30 minutes."

2002
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:13,409
Really?

2003
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,780
They would have something like that.

2004
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,150
That's why they're trying to leave.

2005
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:20,079
- They would have a time limit.
- They would.

2006
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,120
Then...

2007
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:23,890
I think they'd have about an hour.

2008
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,760
- Yes.
- Right.

2009
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:32,729
(The farmhands are about to run.)

2010
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:35,370
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2011
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,830
(That moment!)

2012
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,439
It's just strange.

2013
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,600
(Lord Moon is about to head out.)

2014
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:42,740
One, two...

2015
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,010
- I'm so glad...
- Go!

2016
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,950
- I can run away!
- I can run away!

2017
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:52,019
(The noblemen are late.)

2018
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,219
- I'm so glad...
- I'm so glad...

2019
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:54,449
- I can run away!
- I can run away!

2020
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,420
(One person didn't put his guard down.)

2021
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,890
(Lord Cho)

2022
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:04,390
(Night of the Manhunt)

2023
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,659
- I'm so glad...
- I'm so glad...

2024
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:07,899
- I can run away!
- I can run away!

2025
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,230
(He flew!)

2026
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,269
- I'm so glad...
- I'm so glad...

2027
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:12,640
- I can run away!
- I can run away!

2028
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:17,439
- I'm so glad...
- I'm so glad...

2029
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,780
- I can run away!
- I can run away!

2030
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,610
- I can run away!
- I can run away!

2031
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:23,179
- I'm so glad...
- I'm so glad...

2032
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,850
(Their status will rise once they step outside the gate.)

2033
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,149
Open the gate.

2034
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:28,390
(The first challenge is opening the gate.)

2035
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,790
- I can run away!
- I can run away!

2036
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,860
(Jong Min couldn't open the latch at once!)

2037
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:37,590
(While Jong Min is struggling...)

2038
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,929
I caught him.

2039
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:42,499
(Sae Ho caught Jong Min.)

2040
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,730
- I caught him.
- No.

2041
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,939
(Meanwhile, DinDin and Seon Ho was behind Jong Min.)

2042
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,099
(Open it!)

2043
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,410
(The nobleman attacks.)

2044
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,040
I caught him.

2045
01:11:51,041 --> 01:11:53,439
(They abandon Jong Min right away.)

2046
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,410
We made it. It's open.

2047
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:59,620
(They run like crazy to rise in status.)

2048
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,019
(Lord Moon was a step behind, searching for his hidden shoes.)

2049
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,450
What?

2050
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,690
How dare you? Where did he go?

2051
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:10,860
(Yamen)

2052
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:14,499
It's somewhere in that direction. Just keep running.

2053
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,599
Where are they going?

2054
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,130
(Furious Lord Moon)

2055
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:19,900
(Yamen)

2056
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,149
I'm so glad...

2057
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:31,820
- I can run away!
- I can run away!

2058
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:36,690
(The distance between them slowly grows.)

2059
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:37,819
(Yamen)

2060
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:42,230
(Their status will rise when they turn the corner and go straight.)

2061
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,090
Are they...

2062
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:51,570
(Lord Moon is closely pursuing from behind.)

2063
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:54,269
(But...)

2064
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,470
Isn't it left from here?

2065
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:58,480
Isn't this the place?

2066
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:01,850
Isn't this the place?

2067
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:05,219
(They took the wrong way!)

2068
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,280
(DinDin and Seon Ho)

2069
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,049
(Lord Moon is coming.)

2070
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:12,089
They're there.

2071
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:15,030
(How will the Night of the Manhunt end?)

2072
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:16,460
Isn't it left from here?

2073
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:19,460
Isn't this the place?

2074
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,670
Where are they going?

2075
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:27,240
(He's right behind them!)

2076
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:30,510
Isn't this the place?

2077
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,740
- It's not here.
- Goodness.

2078
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,340
Why didn't you say so?

2079
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,010
Why didn't you say so?

2080
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:39,450
(They left the trap.)

2081
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,150
It's here.

2082
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,820
(Lord Moon)

2083
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,560
It's here.

2084
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,960
(They arrive at the yamen, the actual destination.)

2085
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,730
(They spot the hopaes where they must write their names.)

2086
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:56,129
(Their ranks will switch when they write the names of their noblemen!)

2087
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:57,399
Isn't it written on the back?

2088
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,970
(Their ranks will switch when they write the names of their noblemen!)

2089
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:07,080
(I must write my name before I get caught by Lord Moon.)

2090
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,450
(Choraeng)

2091
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:15,049
(Love, Choraeng)

2092
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:17,119
(They finish writing their names.)

2093
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,919
Right. You two have made it.

2094
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,489
(Seon Ho and DinDin become noblemen from farmhands!)

2095
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:23,160
- That was perfect!
- That was perfect!

2096
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,629
The timing was spot on.

2097
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:26,360
(The start time was very tight.)

2098
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,670
What will Jong Min do? He's in trouble.

2099
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:32,300
(Meanwhile...)

2100
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,140
(He's done for.)

2101
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:38,680
(The reason why Lord Cho was lying down outside)

2102
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,850
(When Lord Cho came out a while ago, )

2103
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,649
You're sleeping with your shoes on?

2104
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:46,780
(he spotted Jong Min sleeping with his shoes on.)

2105
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:50,749
- I think he's about to run away.
- What?

2106
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,120
He's getting ready for that.

2107
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,220
Sae Ho.

2108
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:57,590
Bring this out and lie down outside.

2109
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:04,430
The weather is quite warm, isn't it?

2110
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:06,670
- No!
- What?

2111
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,139
I have to be there...

2112
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,309
- Why?
- with everyone else.

2113
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:11,169
Just stay here. Hurry up and go back inside.

2114
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:12,340
(He tried to fool Lord Cho belatedly.)

2115
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,609
- Please save me!
- I got you!

2116
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,750
I don't want to live as a servant!

2117
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,950
No!

2118
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,119
I don't want to live as a servant!

2119
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,419
No!

2120
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:23,419
I don't want to!

2121
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:25,919
I don't want to live as a servant!

2122
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,960
I got you!

2123
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,590
I don't want to live as a farmhand!

2124
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:31,589
- I got you!
- You said you were going to help!

2125
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:33,660
I just caught my servant.

2126
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:36,399
(Why did I believe those farmhands?)

2127
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,670
I don't want to live as a farmhand!

2128
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,900
I got you!

2129
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,640
- Gosh!
- They're done for.

2130
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:47,239
(Will morning come again?)

2131
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,309
I got you.

2132
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,549
("The Slave Hunters," Airhead Episode)

2133
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,550
- Did you see me catch him?
- I did.

2134
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:55,020
(King Joon Sang wasn't sure about the farmhands' plan.)

2135
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:56,690
- I can run away!
- I can run away!

2136
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,059
Hey!

2137
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,390
(Is it the start of their plan?)

2138
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:05,460
(Farmhand Love runs out.)

2139
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:09,529
(In a split second, )

2140
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:12,940
(their worlds change.)

2141
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,210
What is going on?

2142
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:19,280
(Where have things gone wrong?)

2143
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:25,419
(The plan shared by the farmhands...)

2144
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:28,890
(flashes by in his head.)

2145
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:31,760
They fooled me.

2146
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,760
They fooled me.

2147
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:37,059
(King Joon Sang, the one to sleep outdoors in the future)

2148
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,090
How dare they?

2149
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,360
- We had no choice.
- Right.

2150
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,699
To be honest, Sae Ho...

2151
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,399
- He did well.
- did a great job.

2152
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,470
- The other two were lazy.
- Right.

2153
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:48,969
They fooled me.

2154
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:50,510
(He heads to the yamen after feeling betrayed.)

2155
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,239
You fool! I got you!

2156
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,710
- How dare you!
- How dare you!

2157
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,409
- How dare you!
- How dare you!

2158
01:16:57,410 --> 01:17:00,220
- You fool!
- How dare you stare at me!

2159
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,749
Take off that crown this instant!

2160
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:03,949
- What's going on?
- Take your hands off of me!

2161
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,360
- What's going on?
- You worthless farmhand!

2162
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,859
- Take off your robe!
- You fool!

2163
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:09,660
- What's going on?
- You worthless fool!

2164
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,229
- Hold on.
- Do you know who you are?

2165
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:13,000
You guys can't be like this to me!

2166
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:14,630
Hey!

2167
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,199
- We made a promise!
- Get your hand off of me!

2168
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,670
- Stop yelling and explain.
- Hey!

2169
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,399
You didn't trust your people!

2170
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,010
You're guilty of overhearing our conversation outside the tent!

2171
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:26,539
- What?
- I'm guilty for doing that?

2172
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:27,940
(The result of that is betrayal?)

2173
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,049
- What is that fool doing?
- I'm still the king.

2174
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,979
- I'm still the king.
- He needs help.

2175
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,620
- Is that so?
- Right.

2176
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,249
- Then it must be understood.
- Yes.

2177
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,420
I'm the king!

2178
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:38,519
I'm so glad...

2179
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,359
- I can run away!
- I can run away!

2180
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,390
(Is there a greater joy that can be felt than this?)

2181
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,329
I believe we're done now.

2182
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:45,759
Yes. You can go in and sleep.

2183
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,330
- I'm still the king.
- Well,

2184
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,569
I'll give you the robe and hat as a gift.

2185
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:50,630
Hug them tight as you sleep.

2186
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:52,900
He's a man with a big heart.

2187
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:54,669
Let's go!

2188
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,839
I'm going to be really mean.

2189
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,079
Can you show us your crying acting right now?

2190
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,310
While feeling betrayed.

2191
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,109
I can, but will it be entertaining at this point?

2192
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:04,649
How does it sound to do that once we get back?

2193
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:05,820
- What?
- What?

2194
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:09,190
Why is that? Are you saying it's cold here?

2195
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:11,120
Gosh.

2196
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:13,760
- I really trusted them.
- Let's go.

2197
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:16,490
Your eyes look so sad.

2198
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,059
(It seems like he still has lingering feelings with his outfit.)

2199
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,330
Have you all been doing well?

2200
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,500
Lovely! I have warmed up the tent.

2201
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:26,799
Gosh, I started as a farmhand,

2202
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,439
became the king, and became a farmhand again.

2203
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,469
You've come back to the start.

2204
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:32,779
Have a good night's sleep and we'll meet in the morning.

2205
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:33,780
Okay.

2206
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:35,909
- Great work, everyone.
- Great work, everyone.

2207
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:37,009
- Okay.
- Good night.

2208
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:38,109
Great work, everyone.

2209
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:39,180
Great work.

2210
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,619
(The two who have dropped down greatly in rank...)

2211
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:43,719
Gosh, it's so cold.

2212
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,860
(struggled to go in for a while.)

2213
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:48,289
Gosh, great job, men.

2214
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:50,530
Congratulations on making your return.

2215
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:53,959
Lord Cho kept everything in place.

2216
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,029
Right.

2217
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:56,429
You kept everything in place as you knew its worth.

2218
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:57,470
Of course.

2219
01:18:57,630 --> 01:18:59,870
The other two were too proud of themselves.

2220
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,439
Gosh, it felt intense inside of that tent.

2221
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,510
Exactly.

2222
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:06,210
You two did well to run.

2223
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,210
- Good night! Let's sleep.
- Let's sleep.

2224
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:12,150
Good night! Get some good sleep.

2225
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,220
Why does it feel so small?

2226
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:16,189
Gosh, it's so small.

2227
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:17,320
- Are you okay?
- Gosh.

2228
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:18,859
It's so tough to be a farmhand.

2229
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:20,920
That was why I wanted to win after trying to lie down in here.

2230
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,660
(Then why didn't you win?)

2231
01:19:23,790 --> 01:19:25,360
This isn't a tent.

2232
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,130
A mud hut.

2233
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:30,299
This is crazy. Half of my face is touching the tent.

2234
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,629
- Really?
- Like this.

2235
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:34,040
(Half of Lovely's face is covered by the tent.)

2236
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,440
Gosh, why am I the only one who has to stay as a farmhand?

2237
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:39,109
Gosh, I feel bad.

2238
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:40,310
- Why?
- Why?

2239
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,010
It doesn't feel small for me.

2240
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,909
That part has the most space.

2241
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:45,079
It's serious over here.

2242
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,620
Should I move over there then?

2243
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,419
I can't move at all here.

2244
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,290
(Trying to get into position)

2245
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,260
Have a good night, everyone.

2246
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:56,029
Think of it as an honor to be able to sleep with the king.

2247
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:58,529
Above all things, our Joon needs to have some medicine.

2248
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:00,229
Gosh, he needs help.

2249
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:01,729
Right. He's out of it.

2250
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,900
"I can't believe I'm sleeping with the farmhand and nobleman."

2251
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,600
No medicine will work for him now.

2252
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:08,069
Gosh.

2253
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,640
(A dog joins in as well.)

2254
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:12,379
Hush, dog.

2255
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,940
The king is about to fall asleep.

2256
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,510
(Finding it absurd)

2257
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:18,509
Will he get to his senses after a good beating?

2258
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:21,350
Must he be beaten up until he gets to his senses?

2259
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,689
(No matter what you say, I'm the king.)

2260
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:24,120
You two must have worked on your jokes.

2261
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:26,059
I'm the king.

2262
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:29,190
(Disappointed Joon fell asleep after a long while.)

2263
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:34,730
(The peaceful night in Andong goes by.)

2264
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,140
(The sun glitter appears over Andong Lake.)

2265
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,369
(The morning of Seonseonghyeon Cultural Complex...)

2266
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:45,170
(comes with a sea of clouds.)

2267
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,509
(The travelers in Andong...)

2268
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,510
(are still fast asleep.)

2269
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,350
(It's time to wake up now.)

2270
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:01,390
(Their eyes open wide by the wild wake-up song.)

2271
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:06,460
Get up, Jong Min.

2272
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:12,740
(Something is set up.)

2273
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,140
I see something. Hurry!

2274
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:21,840
(He rushes out without being able to open his eyes.)

2275
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:26,820
(What is it?)

2276
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,249
For your information, this will be really important.

2277
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,420
At the yamen?

2278
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,960
You'd better hurry.

2279
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:35,930
Something great is on the line.

2280
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,730
Where's the yamen?

2281
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:43,170
(Today's morning mission)

2282
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:44,499
(Base camp)

2283
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,970
(Find the getting-off-work scrolls in the yamen.)

2284
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,610
(Find the getting-off-work scrolls hidden in the yamen...)

2285
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:53,880
(and bring it to the return area to pass.)

2286
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:56,780
(Se Yoon is in the lead.)

2287
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:59,650
(Joon sprints while feeling drowsy.)

2288
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:03,750
Something great is on the line. You'd better hurry.

2289
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,220
You must hand them in.

2290
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:10,960
(Feeling alert)

2291
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:14,630
(Hold on. I must tie my shoelaces.)

2292
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,230
Something great is on the line.

2293
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:20,200
(He scans the mission as he runs through.)

2294
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:21,940
(I'll head off first.)

2295
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,040
(You should hurry.)

2296
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,140
(Zooming past)

2297
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:31,150
(DinDin starts sprinting as well.)

2298
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,579
(DinDin, Sae Ho, Jong Min, Joon, Se Yoon)

2299
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:36,420
(They all start running to avoid the unknown disaster.)

2300
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:39,560
(Se Yoon arrives at the yamen first.)

2301
01:22:40,490 --> 01:22:42,730
(Where are the scrolls?)

2302
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:44,729
- They're in here?
- Yes.

2303
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:45,930
(The hidden getting-off-work scrolls)

2304
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:49,270
(One in the house that is furthest inside)

2305
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:51,600
(One in the cushion)

2306
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,700
(One in the umbrella)

2307
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,970
(One will not be revealed.)

2308
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:58,140
(There are 4 in total.)

2309
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,709
(Which 4 will receive the royal command?)

2310
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:00,840
(Get off work! It is an order.)

2311
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:02,510
(Show yourself.)

2312
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,050
(Where are you, scroll?)

2313
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,879
(The two quickly make a search.)

2314
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,080
(Joon, Se Yoon)

2315
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:12,220
(The late runners hurry over.)

2316
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,490
(Sae Ho)

2317
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,930
Really?

2318
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:19,130
- They have to be found.
- What must we find?

2319
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:21,800
Nothing was written on it.

2320
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:25,700
The penalty will be severe!

2321
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:29,240
(Joon and DinDin split up to both sides.)

2322
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:31,510
- What must we find?
- Look for them.

2323
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,940
(Jong Min and Sae Ho were running to the area furthest inside.)

2324
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:36,910
What?

2325
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:38,650
(Se Yoon hurriedly runs out?)

2326
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:41,150
- What must we find?
- Look for them.

2327
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:42,990
(It's a scroll.)

2328
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,150
(Se Yoon looked for it diligently.)

2329
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,520
(He's approaching the getting-off-work scroll.)

2330
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:51,930
(What?)

2331
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:55,529
(He finds the scroll placed at the easiest spot to find.)

2332
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:56,530
What?

2333
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:00,800
Can I go home once I hand this in?

2334
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:03,970
Did you find it?

2335
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,370
(Already?)

2336
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:10,080
(He proudly arrives at the submission location.)

2337
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,779
(Se Yoon gets to go home.)

2338
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:15,850
This is killing me.

2339
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,850
I think he found one here.

2340
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:20,120
Is it in here?

2341
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,860
(Seon Ho joins them to find the scroll.)

2342
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,730
(Joon is approaching the getting-off-work scroll.)

2343
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:29,970
Why can't I find it?

2344
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:32,800
(It's right next to you.)

2345
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:34,499
It's not here.

2346
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,410
(Lee Joon is getting closer to the getting-off-work scroll.)

2347
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:40,180
(He checks under the umbrella?)

2348
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:42,680
(He found it?)

2349
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:47,920
(He just looks under the floor and passes it by.)

2350
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:53,020
(He only searches the far corners carefully.)

2351
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:56,330
(As if by a twist of fate, he misses what's right before his eyes.)

2352
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:59,230
(In the meantime)

2353
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:01,360
(Running hurriedly)

2354
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:02,769
(Sae Ho, DinDin)

2355
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:04,100
(The two members gathered in the same place.)

2356
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,070
(This place is...)

2357
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:10,370
(where one of the scrolls are hidden.)

2358
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:16,480
(Sae Ho approaches right in front of the scroll.)

2359
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,320
(At this rate, there's a good chance he will find it.)

2360
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,780
(At this moment)

2361
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:23,050
(DinDin appears just in time.)

2362
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,720
I got it.

2363
01:25:26,721 --> 01:25:28,120
(He found it.)

2364
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:29,829
(The fate of getting off work changed in a matter of seconds.)

2365
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:31,529
How cunning he is.

2366
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:33,630
- Impressive.
- He's really amazing.

2367
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:38,930
It feels so good and exhilarating.

2368
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,540
(While Se Yoon and DinDin succeeded...)

2369
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,110
(There are 2 getting-off-work scrolls left.)

2370
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,080
(4 people remaining)

2371
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,710
(Jong Min is wandering aimlessly.)

2372
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:52,110
(Where is it?)

2373
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:57,920
(A getting-off-work scroll?)

2374
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:00,260
(The hidden scroll is...)

2375
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:03,260
(in Jong Min's cameraman's hood.)

2376
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,359
Can I go in there?

2377
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,600
(It has always been a step behind him.)

2378
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:11,070
(It seems like he will never find it.)

2379
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:13,240
(Sae Ho shows up.)

2380
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,910
Maybe in there...

2381
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,550
What's with him?

2382
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,179
(Jong Min doesn't understand why Sae Ho is galloping.)

2383
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,250
He found it.

2384
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,720
- Where?
- Gosh, seriously...

2385
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:32,360
(Sae Ho was looking around.)

2386
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:41,400
(He found the getting-off-work scroll.)

2387
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:46,540
(Running away)

2388
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:50,169
- Unbelievable.
- Oh, dear.

2389
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:51,440
(Feeling betrayed)

2390
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:52,909
You may go home.

2391
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:53,910
(Sae Ho gets to go home.)

2392
01:26:53,911 --> 01:26:55,040
I found it at a really good place.

2393
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:58,109
What if it ends just like this?

2394
01:26:58,110 --> 01:26:59,119
(There's only one scroll left now.)

2395
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,850
Why is it so hard to find it?

2396
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:02,790
There's no scroll left?

2397
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,120
I think there's one left.

2398
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:08,320
(Time is passing relentlessly.)

2399
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,459
Is it too hard, guys?

2400
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:12,930
- Yes.
- I'll give you a clue.

2401
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:15,200
Listen. Here's the clue.

2402
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:16,830
Umbrella.

2403
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,740
(Umbrella?)

2404
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,370
(It's right there.)

2405
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:26,140
(The three of them run toward the umbrella.)

2406
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:30,880
(The last getting-off-work scroll)

2407
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,080
Umbrella.

2408
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,949
(The last chance to avoid the big penalty)

2409
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:35,080
It's a big penalty.

2410
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:37,089
It's a very big penalty.

2411
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:39,260
(The last person to get the scroll)

2412
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:42,119
(Who would it be?)

2413
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,360
Umbrella!

2414
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,800
(It's Jong Min.)

2415
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,040
(He gets the last getting-off-work scroll.)

2416
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,809
(Seon Ho tries to stop him, but he can't.)

2417
01:27:57,810 --> 01:27:59,069
I'm coming.

2418
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:00,940
(Jong Min's cameraman is laughing.)

2419
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:07,280
(He can get off work!)

2420
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:09,050
Here's the result of the morning mission.

2421
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:11,289
The members who found the getting-off-work scrolls,

2422
01:28:11,290 --> 01:28:14,319
DinDin, Se Yoon, Jong Min, and Sae Ho,

2423
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,560
I'm so happy.

2424
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:17,389
Can leave Andong...

2425
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:19,089
- and go home.
- What? It doesn't end in Andong?

2426
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:20,599
- And...
- What?

2427
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,869
The two members who failed to find the scroll...

2428
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:24,130
- What?
- What are you talking about?

2429
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,569
Will leave for Hanyang.

2430
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:26,800
- Seoul?
- Seoul?

2431
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,499
(We can't go home? Unbelievable.)

2432
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:29,569
- Seoul?
- I knew it.

2433
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,070
I thought I wanted to go to Hanyang.

2434
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:32,809
- Let's say goodbye.
- Your Majesty.

2435
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:36,250
- Your grace is immeasurable.
- Your grace is immeasurable.

2436
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:37,649
We are leaving.

2437
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:39,080
(Laughing)

2438
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:42,120
We will leave for Hanyang right away.

2439
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,220
Let's go to Hanyang.

2440
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:46,790
- Chorong.
- Your Majesty.

2441
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,430
I'd like to go to Hanyang.

2442
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,100
(The King and Chorong teleported somewhere.)

2443
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,269
Where are we, Your Majesty?

2444
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:05,510
Where is this?

2445
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:07,140
Why are we here?

2446
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:09,450
Where are we?

2447
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:12,250
This is Hanyang, the capital of Joseon.

2448
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,779
Hanyang.

2449
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:14,780
(Joon and Seon Ho crash-land at Gwanghwamun for the mission.)

2450
01:29:14,781 --> 01:29:16,790
The two of you, who failed to find a getting-off-work scroll,

2451
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:18,049
will work overtime as rickshaw pullers...

2452
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:19,989
before you get off work.

2453
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:21,459
It's like a taxi of the Joseon Dynasty.

2454
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:24,789
I'll get changed first. I can't do it in this mood.

2455
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:26,199
- I'll change my clothes.
- Just give him the costume.

2456
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,799
- I'll give you.
- He complains a lot.

2457
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,300
My clothes...

2458
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:32,500
(They filmed it after the safety training.)

2459
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,400
(After getting changed)

2460
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:38,770
(The getting-off-work mission, rickshaw-pulling begins.)

2461
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:40,239
It's moving.

2462
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,439
(Joon, the rickshaw puller, begins to speed up.)

2463
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,110
It's moving.

2464
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:46,580
This is like "Live Info Show."

2465
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:49,249
(This is something you'd see on "Live Info Show.")

2466
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:52,050
The king is losing his dignity.

2467
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:53,820
I'm supposed to be the king.

2468
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:56,960
Let's go.

2469
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:01,860
(The rickshaw runs powerfully.)

2470
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:03,100
Isn't this amazing?

2471
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:06,240
We are riding a rickshaw pulled by a handsome celebrity.

2472
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,639
How are you feeling?

2473
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,669
- It's fun.
- It feels great.

2474
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:10,810
I love it.

2475
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,709
Do you enjoy watching 2 Days 1 Night?

2476
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,739
- We watch it all the time.
- We watch it often.

2477
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:16,080
- Really?
- Yes.

2478
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:19,550
The reason I'm doing this now...

2479
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:22,280
is because I was chosen to do the getting-off-work mission.

2480
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:25,120
The other members went home.

2481
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:27,590
I'm working overtime now.

2482
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,429
- I see.
- We came to Seoul...

2483
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:30,529
at the perfect time.

2484
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:31,560
I know.

2485
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:34,260
Which member do you find funny?

2486
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,200
Well...

2487
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,729
- A comedian...
- What?

2488
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:39,570
(Joon doesn't seem like their favorite.)

2489
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:41,739
You can be honest with me.

2490
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:42,940
To be honest...

2491
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,869
- Joon.
- Se Yoon.

2492
01:30:44,870 --> 01:30:46,010
And?

2493
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:48,280
DinDin.

2494
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:50,579
- DinDin?
- Yes.

2495
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:51,910
- DinDin.
- And?

2496
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:53,949
- And...
- Just pick one.

2497
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:55,379
He's here.

2498
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:56,950
- And? I'm next?
- Yes.

2499
01:30:57,050 --> 01:30:58,490
- I'm your third favorite.
- Yes.

2500
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:01,159
This is fun, isn't it?

2501
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,230
- Yes. It's really fun.
- It's fun.

2502
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:05,089
- You should tell people...
- Okay.

2503
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:08,060
That Uncle Joon pulled a rickshaw for you.

2504
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:09,499
I told my friends.

2505
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,770
You did? But I'm not sure if your friends know who I am.

2506
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,869
We're here. It's safe.

2507
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:17,510
- I'll stop safely.
- Thank you.

2508
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:20,179
- All right. We're here.
- We're here.

2509
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,280
Hang on a second.

2510
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,949
I'm so afraid to speak in English.

2511
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:25,749
I'm nervous. What should I say in English?

2512
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:26,780
(In the meantime, Seon Ho's rickshaw starts.)

2513
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:29,950
(Seon Ho is giving a ride to foreign guests.)

2514
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:33,360
What are three things you'd recommend visiting around here?

2515
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,820
First of all, K-food.

2516
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:37,560
- Okay.
- Well...

2517
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:39,730
Bulgogi and tteokbokki.

2518
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:43,569
Have you ever tried bulgogi?

2519
01:31:43,570 --> 01:31:46,769
Not here yet, but in the States.

2520
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:49,170
- In the States?
- In the States, yes.

2521
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:51,010
Almost done.

2522
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:52,310
All right.

2523
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:55,580
This place is lovely. I enjoyed it.

2524
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:59,149
(He's driving safely until the very end.)

2525
01:31:59,150 --> 01:32:01,650
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

2526
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,389
- It was nice meeting you.
- Thank you.

2527
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:05,190
- It was nice meeting you too.
- Thanks.

2528
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,660
(We thank everyone who helped with the filming.)

2529
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,260
(The getting-off-work mission is over.)

2530
01:32:12,630 --> 01:32:13,700
Hello.

2531
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:15,699
Aren't you curious about 2 Days 1 Night's...

2532
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,130
trip to Andong?

2533
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:19,940
The most Korean region in Korea!

2534
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,670
A place where you can enjoy Korean style and tradition.

2535
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:26,240
Come visit Andong!

2536
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:29,980
Who are we?

2537
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:34,449
- 2 Days 1 Night!

2539
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:39,660
(Next episode)

2540
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:42,729
(Year 2025)

2541
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:45,330
(For all your hard work)

2542
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:47,900
(Year-End Hardship Settlement Race)

2543
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,200
(Looking at pretty things)

2544
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:51,969
(Eating delicious food)

2545
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:54,069
(A day to be rewarded for their hard work)

2546
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:55,970
(That's what they thought.)

2547
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,370
(No way. Impossible.)

2548
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,240
(Getting into the water in winter)

2549
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,380
(The race for getting into the water in winter begins.)

2550
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,480
(Bring it on!)

2551
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:08,419
(To avoid the cold water, )

2552
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:11,190
(they start a desperate struggle.)

2553
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,690
(The harsh winter dive is waiting for them.)

2554
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:17,690
- Go away.
- Let's go.

2555
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:20,460
(The moment of fate is approaching.)

2556
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,200
(Who will jump into the water in the bitter cold of December?)

2557
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:27,170
(See you next week.)
