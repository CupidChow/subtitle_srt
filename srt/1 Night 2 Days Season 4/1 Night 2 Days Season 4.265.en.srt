1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:02,718
(Last week's morning mission was about the opening time.)

2
00:00:03,248 --> 00:00:06,948
(They joined forces with the crew to complete a bingo line.)

3
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:09,957
(Do you all want to come in at the crack of dawn?)

4
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:12,187
(The crew cooperated to come to work in the afternoon.)

5
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:13,787
(Play Bingo With the Crew)

6
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:15,797
(The last part was to jump a rope 10 times.)

7
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:18,028
(An easy win!)

8
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:20,628
(They'll film the opening at 1:16pm.)

9
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:22,537
(A 1:16pm opening)

10
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:24,068
(Dreams come true.)

11
00:00:25,338 --> 00:00:29,478
(2 Days 1 Night)

12
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:31,637
(Yeouido where you can see...)

13
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:33,178
(the Han River and the National Assembly Building)

14
00:00:33,508 --> 00:00:35,047
(We start at midday...)

15
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:37,578
(and at KBS, of all places.)

16
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:39,988
- Hi, how are you? - Aren't you cold?

17
00:00:40,148 --> 00:00:41,518
Isn't it okay now?

18
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:46,758
(It's currently 1pm.)

19
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:48,727
(A car door slowly opens.)

20
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:50,528
Hello. My gosh.

21
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:54,898
(A wide smile)

22
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:56,837
- Hi. - Hello.

23
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:58,137
- You got a haircut. - Yes.

24
00:00:58,138 --> 00:00:59,138
Looking good.

25
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:00,507
It felt weird.

26
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:02,407
Like I'm filming a different program?

27
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:03,678
(It felt like filming a different program.)

28
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:05,338
Sae Ho.

29
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:08,908
(A 1:16pm high-five of victory)

30
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:10,817
- This is great. - Is it?

31
00:01:10,818 --> 00:01:12,048
It got so warm.

32
00:01:12,648 --> 00:01:13,717
You look happy.

33
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:14,918
- Hello. - Hi.

34
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:16,688
- Hey. - Hello.

35
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:18,718
Doesn't he look hyper?

36
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:21,287
I went to the hairdresser after six months.

37
00:01:21,288 --> 00:01:22,388
- Look forward to it. - Sae Ho.

38
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:25,097
(Here comes another happy fairy.)

39
00:01:25,098 --> 00:01:26,328
What lovely weather.

40
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:29,098
(He squawks happily like a crow.)

41
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,368
I love it today.

42
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:32,568
Hi.

43
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:34,408
Hello.

44
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:36,038
My gosh.

45
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:37,607
How nice of you!

46
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:39,108
- Hey. - I love it.

47
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:42,077
DinDin must be coming right on time.

48
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:43,078
- Yes. - Yes.

49
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,317
- He's here. - He's here.

50
00:01:44,318 --> 00:01:45,478
- He's here. - He got here early.

51
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:46,748
He's smiling.

52
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:50,357
(His teeth shine brighter than ever.)

53
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:51,358
- Hello. - Gosh.

54
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,387
It's so bright.

55
00:01:52,388 --> 00:01:53,657
- It's nice. - It is.

56
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:54,857
- It's nice. - It's nice.

57
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:56,557
- It's nice. - It's so nice.

58
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,027
Isn't it great? They kept their word.

59
00:01:58,028 --> 00:01:59,167
It is great.

60
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:00,467
- How... - Honestly.

61
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:01,968
Aren't we more hyper than we've ever been?

62
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,567
Let's go!

63
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:05,698
- Yes! - Let's do it.

64
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:08,967
This is how a 2 Days 1 Night opening should be.

65
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:10,077
- Right? - Yes.

66
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:11,337
Look at how pretty they are.

67
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:13,447
Look at them. They're so pretty.

68
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:15,108
- They're celebrities. - We're celebrities.

69
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:17,047
- We'll keep our word. - Okay.

70
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:18,517
We'll start at 1:16pm sharp.

71
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:19,618
- Really? - Yes.

72
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:21,148
That's even better.

73
00:02:21,618 --> 00:02:23,387
- We're 20 seconds away. - It's almost time.

74
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:24,957
- Counting down. - Let's do the opening.

75
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,227
- For real? - This is...

76
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:27,887
a historic day with an afternoon opening.

77
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:30,427
At 1:16pm, 1:16 in the afternoon,

78
00:02:30,428 --> 00:02:31,657
- we'll start shooting. - Okay.

79
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:33,427
- Ten seconds to go. - It's a first for Season Four.

80
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:34,998
It's our first-ever afternoon opening.

81
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:38,268
(They were always tired early in the morning.)

82
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:40,868
(Now they're bursting with dopamine.)

83
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,277
(A man who was always teary-eyed...)

84
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:46,578
(is now dancing.)

85
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:49,108
(A man who was always annoyed...)

86
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:52,177
(is now celebrating.)

87
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:53,187
That's crazy.

88
00:02:53,188 --> 00:02:54,617
- Come on. - Ten.

89
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:55,647
(He recovered the glint in his eyes and pretty looks.)

90
00:02:55,648 --> 00:02:56,717
Let's go!

91
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,518
It's like counting down to New Year's Day.

92
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:00,258
I love it! This is fun.

93
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,557
It's time.

94
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:03,298
It's almost 1:16pm!

95
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:05,858
- Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

96
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:07,027
- Now! - Now!

97
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:09,938
(2 Days 1 Night grand opening)

98
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:14,337
(A moment of joy and exhilaration where a dream came true)

99
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:15,338
- Yes! - Yes!

100
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:18,308
(We're just filming the opening. We didn't reach the semifinals.)

101
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:20,278
Yes!

102
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,177
- This is 2 Days 1 Night! - It's 2 Days 1 Night!

103
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:24,178
Hey, Seon Ho.

104
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:25,448
It's not the second day!

105
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:27,448
This is the opening of the first day!

106
00:03:28,088 --> 00:03:31,287
Korea's best real wild road variety show!

107
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:32,487
2 Days 1 Night Season 4...

108
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:35,057
succeeded in filming an opening in the afternoon!

109
00:03:35,058 --> 00:03:37,258
(We succeeded in filming an opening?)

110
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:40,927
(Look at this clock.)

111
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,198
(Look at these faces.)

112
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:46,407
(Feeling emotional)

113
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:47,808
It's so sad.

114
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,477
- It's so sad. - It's a first.

115
00:03:50,478 --> 00:03:51,977
It's so sad.

116
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,977
The current time...

117
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:55,307
- is 1:16pm. - It's 1:16pm.

118
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,378
- Is this for real? - On the previous trip,

119
00:03:57,978 --> 00:03:59,717
we won this opening.

120
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:01,487
- Would the day come? - It has come.

121
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:02,617
- It came. - It came at last.

122
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,488
- Yes. - We all deserve applause.

123
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,788
Look.

124
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,098
We don't smell of musky sweat.

125
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:12,727
- We smell of flowery shampoo. - We smell of shampoo.

126
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:14,068
We all washed our hair.

127
00:04:14,198 --> 00:04:16,068
- Such a fragrant opening... - We smell nice.

128
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,767
- I don't remember the last time. - No.

129
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:19,137
I don't remember. Isn't this great?

130
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:20,138
- I feel clean. - Yes.

131
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,537
Not one is frowning.

132
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:23,107
- Right. There are no frowns. - It's so nice.

133
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,537
- So... - I feel clean.

134
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:25,907
(Except for one person)

135
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:28,447
Shall we each say how many hours we slept?

136
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:29,448
How long did you sleep?

137
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:31,248
I had some wine last night.

138
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:34,318
- Hey. - The night before a shoot,

139
00:04:34,388 --> 00:04:35,747
- I had a drink. - You drank wine?

140
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:37,187
I had wine and slept for ten hours.

141
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,427
- How do you feel now? - The best I've ever felt.

142
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:41,957
I feel better than I did the day of my debut.

143
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,057
- Can you show us a turn? - I can do anything.

144
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:44,358
What? A turn?

145
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:46,268
Why not? I can spin once.

146
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:48,298
You feel that great.

147
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:50,038
- Did that just fly? - No!

148
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:53,208
(Fling, Thud)

149
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:55,107
(No!)

150
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:56,978
- Your phone... - It's broken!

151
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:59,237
Oh, no. It's broken?

152
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:01,247
- For real? - But you feel good!

153
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:02,507
- Hang on. - You feel good!

154
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:04,317
- Hang on. - You feel good.

155
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:05,577
- Let's see. - You feel good.

156
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:07,318
- I feel good! - It's okay.

157
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:09,317
- It's not that bad. - I can buy another phone!

158
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:10,318
It's broken!

159
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,657
- Will you... - I'll get a new one!

160
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:12,658
You will?
- I'll replace it. - Joon.

161
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:14,957
It broke because it's a phone.

162
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,097
- I'll replace it. - Yes.

163
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:18,158
- It's not bulletproof. - It's fine.

164
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:21,398
As per the result of the previous morning mission,

165
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:23,367
you're guaranteed five hours of sleep.

166
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:24,368
- Okay. - Great.

167
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:26,137
- Five hours? - It's fine. We slept well.

168
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:27,167
Yes.

169
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:30,038
- We're fine. - Filming will end at noon tomorrow.

170
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:31,608
Really?

171
00:05:31,609 --> 00:05:33,407
- What? - Filming ends at noon?

172
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:35,077
- Yes, at noon. - We're so happy.

173
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:36,277
That's it.

174
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:38,017
- Today's theme is... - The theme.

175
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:40,048
Drifting Around KBS.

176
00:05:40,748 --> 00:05:42,757
- That sounds like fun. - We won't leave this place?

177
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,157
- That's great. - The plan is...

178
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:45,788
- to film only inside KBS. - That's it?

179
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,527
- That's different. - Is that possible?

180
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:48,828
You'll drift around KBS.

181
00:05:49,528 --> 00:05:52,097
(We signaled the start of the show...)

182
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:55,128
(here at KBS.)

183
00:05:55,728 --> 00:05:58,998
(Lights here are on 24 hours a day.)

184
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:02,737
(We'll drift around for 2 days and 1 night.)

185
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,707
We began this trip much later than usual.

186
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,148
- Yes. - For 2 days and 1 night,

187
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:09,277
we must get enough footage to air.

188
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:10,417
- Yes. - That's a tall order.

189
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:11,777
- That's a given. - Naturally.

190
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:14,748
So from now until filming ends,

191
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:17,958
cameras will roll for 22 hours and 44 minutes.

192
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:19,887
(Laughing incredulously)

193
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:20,957
Cameras...

194
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,957
Are you filming a documentary today?

195
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,798
Why will you film us all day long?

196
00:06:25,258 --> 00:06:29,537
(A 22-hour 44-minute up-close record of their movements)

197
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:31,038
- How about a game? - No.

198
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:32,637
But we have breaks.

199
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:35,708
Even during the breaks, cameras will be on us?

200
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,008
(Cameras will roll without any breaks!)

201
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:40,777
(Thinking there are no cameras, )

202
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:42,047
(they suggest going to a deserted island.)

203
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:45,218
(Did we get that?)

204
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:46,617
We're confident.

205
00:06:46,618 --> 00:06:47,948
Are you people not?

206
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:50,017
We're confident we can film and rest.

207
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:51,088
We'll see.

208
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:52,827
- We don't have much time. - Why not?

209
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:54,227
I'll give you a mission.

210
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:55,327
- Right now? - Yes.

211
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:56,628
A mission?

212
00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:59,828
It's the Airtime Squeeze Mission.

213
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:01,628
- We must squeeze out airtime? - "Squeeze?"

214
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:04,298
I think that's what we're worst at.

215
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:06,407
"Film something we can air."

216
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:08,867
As soon as we hear that, we go clunky and act weird.

217
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:10,007
- We... - Let's not fail.

218
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,678
- We like acting natural. - Okay.

219
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:13,348
It's a team mission.

220
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,707
- You'll move in teams of two. - Okay.

221
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,718
You'll go to a total of six locations within KBS...

222
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:21,147
to meet the participants to carry out a mission.

223
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:22,287
- This should be fun. - Yes.

224
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:23,517
It sounds like fun already.

225
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:25,587
If you succeed four or more missions,

226
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:26,758
you get lunch.

227
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:28,357
- Okay. - However,

228
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:29,627
while you do the missions,

229
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:31,797
you can't contact the other members.

230
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:32,798
Okay.

231
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,698
Jong Min and Seon Ho are a team.

232
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,168
Se Yoon and Sae Ho are a team.

233
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:37,597
- Se and Sae. - Great!

234
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:39,067
- Joon and DinDin. - Great!

235
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:40,467
Perfect. He's my director.

236
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:42,938
Here's where you must go to do your first missions.

237
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:44,937
- They're all different? They are. - And those are...

238
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:46,137
- your name tags. - Great.

239
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:47,507
We need these today.

240
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,108
This makes me feel young. I wanted to wear this.

241
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:50,378
- Hey. - Nice.

242
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:52,577
- Do you know your way around? - Of course I do.

243
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:53,787
I was around for 20 years.

244
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:55,647
"Music Bank," "6 Heroines."

245
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:56,857
- Yes. - For real?

246
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:58,457
I did lots of shows too. "Family Entertainment,"

247
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,357
- "Experience Life." - That wasn't filmed here.

248
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:01,358
- Let's go. - Are you ready?

249
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,688
- Don't we open this? - Get set...

250
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:04,728
- Let's go. - Go!

251
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:06,768
We'll rely on age and experience.

252
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:07,897
Let's go.

253
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:09,697
It's where we go all the time.

254
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:10,938
We were there last week.

255
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:13,968
We know this place like the back of our hands.

256
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:16,277
- Deep inside... - ChoNam Zone.

257
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,508
We filmed there to perform our song.

258
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:20,007
- Just once? - Yes.

259
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:21,407
- I was on twice. - Were you?

260
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:23,048
- Do you know that? - Yes, I do.

261
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:25,117
- Wasn't that pretty recent? - It was recent.

262
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:26,118
- Yes. - Yes.

263
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,188
(Se Yoon was on "Music Bank" twice with his alter ego.)

264
00:08:27,688 --> 00:08:29,558
- You know where we're going, right? - Of course.

265
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:30,818
I don't know much about this place.

266
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:32,618
Hold on. Is this the KBS annex building?

267
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,258
- This is the main building. - This is the main building.

268
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:35,927
- It's across from here. - Yes, it is.

269
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:37,958
We must pass through them. You know the way there, right?

270
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:43,167
I see a lot of fans here.

271
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:45,067
(It's packed with fans waiting for "Music Bank.")

272
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:46,367
Yes. The fans are waiting here.

273
00:08:46,368 --> 00:08:47,807
Yes. Should we get them to cheer?

274
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:48,867
- My gosh. - Should we try that?

275
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:49,938
(Surprised)

276
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,907
- We can jump into the crowd. - We can jump in all of a sudden.

277
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:53,307
- Out of the blue. - We'll jump in out of the blue.

278
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,047
- We can scream. - We can scream and say, "2 Days..."

279
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:56,778
- Right. Try it. - I can't do it.

280
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:58,077
I'll play rock-paper-scissors for it.

281
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:00,288
- The loser should go. - Yes.

282
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:02,217
- 2 Days 1 Night! - Okay.

283
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:03,888
Stop it. People are watching.

284
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:05,518
- The loser will have to do it. Yes. - Is it a single round?

285
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:06,687
- Rock-paper... - Hold on.

286
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:07,787
- Ready or not... - Wait.

287
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:08,827
Hold on.

288
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,357
- This is a huge deal for me. - I know.

289
00:09:10,358 --> 00:09:11,497
- This is... - It's a big deal for me too.

290
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:12,827
- I feel dizzy. - We don't have time.

291
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:14,127
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

292
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:15,168
(Se Yoon: Paper, Sae Ho: Scissors)

293
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:17,568
(Se Yoon will have to do it.)

294
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:20,637
(The introvert is shuddering while the extrovert is excited.)

295
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:21,808
Go and do it.

296
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:24,407
- Could you let it slide this once? - No. I can't.

297
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:25,778
- I'll give you 1,000 dollars. - No.

298
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:27,877
- I'll give you 1,000 dollars. - Don't be ridiculous.

299
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:28,947
- Go and do it. - My gosh, where?

300
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:30,318
You must go to the center by yourself.

301
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:31,947
- Over there. - I can see it.

302
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:34,118
- Go. Hurry up. Come on. - My gosh.

303
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:36,218
We'll film him from here.

304
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,127
(The introvert, Bookku Ddoong, )

305
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:44,027
(runs through the crowd of girls.)

306
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,028
Keep going.

307
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:46,497
(Having a blast)

308
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:47,598
Hey!

309
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:50,098
- This is crazy. - What's going on?

310
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:51,968
- Isn't it Moon Se Yoon? - It's Se Yoon!

311
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:55,838
(It's as if he's at a zoo.)

312
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:59,577
(Will the girls respond to Bookku Ddoong?)

313
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:00,678
2 Days...

314
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,078
2 Days...

315
00:10:04,548 --> 00:10:06,218
- 1 Night. - Thank you!

316
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:07,518
2 Days...

317
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:09,447
- 1 Night. - Thank you!

318
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:10,518
(Running away at full speed)

319
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:12,818
Stay there.

320
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:15,127
(Why is he so shy?)

321
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:16,358
- Come on. Hurry. - You must stay there a bit.

322
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:18,727
- Thank you. - Thank you.

323
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:19,897
(Thank you, girls.)

324
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:20,968
I was so shy.

325
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:22,697
TS-15.

326
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:23,838
(While Se Yoon and Sae Ho are on their way to TS-15...)

327
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:28,538
(The secondary control room of TS-15)

328
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:31,938
(The preliminary recording of "Music Bank" is being held.)

329
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:34,208
(At that moment, a man is on standby...)

330
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,848
(with the flag of the show off the stage.)

331
00:10:37,378 --> 00:10:38,817
(2 Days 1 Night)

332
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,548
(Will Se Yoon and Sae Ho be able to find this flag?)

333
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:43,117
- Isn't it this way? - This way.

334
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:44,588
Right? Who's on today?

335
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:45,758
Hello.

336
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,487
- TS-15. - Hello.

337
00:10:47,488 --> 00:10:48,987
- Hello. - Hello.

338
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:50,327
- Hello. - Hello.

339
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:51,857
(They hear a cute greeting from somewhere.)

340
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:53,328
- Hello. - Hello.

341
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:55,868
(It's the new girl group, Hearts2Hearts.)

342
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,167
- Thank you. - Thank you.

343
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:01,368
Gosh, it feels surreal to see celebrities here.

344
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:03,207
- Hey, ZEROBASEONE. - ZEROBASEONE.

345
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,307
- ZB1. - ZB1.

346
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:05,377
ZB1.

347
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:06,747
People call ZEROBASEONE as ZB1 too.

348
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:07,808
- Right. - Yes.

349
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:10,748
- This is TS-15. - Yes, we must go to TS-15.

350
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:13,688
They're getting ready now.

351
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:14,988
The mission...

352
00:11:15,748 --> 00:11:17,617
You must find the person for your mission here.

353
00:11:17,618 --> 00:11:19,018
How would we know who that is?

354
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:21,557
(They keep walking into the studio.)

355
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:22,558
Right here.

356
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:25,498
Hello, sir.

357
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,728
- Hello. - He has our show's flag.

358
00:11:27,998 --> 00:11:29,167
Are you the guy we have to do the mission with?

359
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:30,398
- This is crazy. - But...

360
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:32,267
- Yes. - I see.

361
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:33,338
We found him.

362
00:11:33,638 --> 00:11:34,968

(ILLIT, 6.14 million views)

366
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:43,378
I'm in production of indoor studio videos.

367
00:11:43,678 --> 00:11:45,778
I'm currently on "Music Bank" and "The Seasons."

368
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:48,848
In the past, I was also on "Immortal Songs."

369
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:52,558
Since I'm on a lot of music shows,

370
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:56,158
my job feels rewarding when I see compliments in the comments.

371
00:11:56,598 --> 00:11:59,058
I'm a huge fan of K-pop.

372
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:01,527
To film the performance in a single take,

373
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:04,038
I have to memorize the whole song to film the performance.

374
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:06,567
So that memory stays with me the most.

375

(The young blood of the KBS shows who's always on the move)

377
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,077
That's a heavy one.

378
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:15,447
- Are you a cameraman? - Yes. I'm in charge of Steadicam.

379
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:16,748
Steadicam? I see.

380
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:19,217
But he's too handsome to be a cameraman.

381
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:20,488
(Shy)

382
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:22,747
Let's go. My gosh, what do we do?

383
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:23,987
(They head out for the mission together.)

384
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:25,017
- After... - For the mission.

385
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:26,628
- It's this way, sir. - Sir.

386
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:28,628
- I'm sorry about this. - But you're so handsome.

387
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:30,027
- Gosh, no. - Why is he so handsome?

388
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:31,427
- He's like an idol star. - Is he a member of an idol group?

389
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:33,028
(He feels dizzy as they shower him with compliments.)

390
00:12:34,168 --> 00:12:35,598
- Today, we'll be filming... - Yes.

391
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:37,738
- our show in the KBS building. - Yes.

392
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:39,097
So we have to do a mission with you.

393
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:40,167
- That's what we were informed. - Yes.

394
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:41,307
May we ask your name?

395
00:12:41,308 --> 00:12:42,567
It's Lee Kang Yul.

396
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:43,577
- I see. - Ryul?

397
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:44,677
- Yul like yulmucha. - Yul.

398
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:46,307
- Yulmucha. I like that tea. - Yul.

399
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,878
- I see. - Cameraman Lee Kang Yul.

400
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:49,607
- What's the mission? - We...

401
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:50,878
- It's heavy. - Yes.

402
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:52,978
- Can you put it down? - Yes.

403
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:58,587
I find that really sexy. When he takes that off,

404
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:00,727
his chest and back are sweaty.

405
00:13:00,728 --> 00:13:01,828
He...

406
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:04,658
(Looking sexy is the medal of hard work.)

407
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:06,667
You've worked with many artists.

408
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:08,528
But is there an artist you want to work with personally?

409
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:11,168
I really regret that last week...

410
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:14,568
I should have filmed your performance.

411
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:16,707
Back in the day, cameramen used to circle around for ballad songs.

412
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,708
Right.

413
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:18,908
- The camera should circle around. - But the cameraman didn't do that.

414
00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:19,978
My gosh.

415
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:21,177
Just like he said,

416
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:23,647
Cameraman Kang Yul will use the gimbal...

417
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:25,417
and film the performance with some camera movements.

418
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:26,747
- He'll film us? - Yes.

419
00:13:26,748 --> 00:13:29,018
Really? With the gimbal? We'd be honored then.

420
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:31,358
I see. He can film with the gimbal too.

421
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:33,827
What song do you want?

422
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:34,887
- Our song? - Yes.

423
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:36,598
We'll perform "POWER" in our own style.

424
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:38,398
- Let me give it a try. - By the way,

425
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:40,027
can you still film them without knowing their performance?

426
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,127
- Of course. - Really?

427
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:42,967
- Yes. - Is there choreography for it?

428
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:44,097
Let's give it a try.

429
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:45,098
Power
Like this.

430
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,008
- Get ready. - Let's make it look cool.

431
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:49,538
Action.

432
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:55,448
Go.

433
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:57,477
(What a mess.)

434
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:58,577
Let's go. Two.

435
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:00,348
(Can he salvage their awful dancing?)

436
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,518
("POWER" by Se and Sae, 2 Days 1 Night)

437
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:06,418
Go.

438
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:07,828
It's your turn.

439
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,628
Let's go. Two.

440
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,728
(Power?)

441
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,498
(His playful side is on.)

442
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:21,668
(Showing off their talents in spades)

443
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:24,278
(What's wrong with them?)

444
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:27,148
(As they dance in the same spot, )

445
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:30,018
(the feet of the cameraman move busily.)

446
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,518
(Thanks to him, there are dynamic movements.)

447
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:36,888
My gosh.

448
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:39,117
(Impressively quick on his toes)

449
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:40,228
What was that?

450
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:41,758
- My gosh. - What was that?

451
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:42,927
(Fully satisfied with his work)

452
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:45,158
- What was that? - You're great at your job.

453
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:47,228
My gosh. He's out of breath too.

454
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:48,728
- Right. - My gosh.

455
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,438
It's like pigs went on a strike.

456
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:52,397
Seriously. They're done with performing.

457
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:53,438
- So... - Strike?

458
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:56,438
So what do we have to do with him for our mission?

459
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:57,577
All right.

460
00:14:57,578 --> 00:14:58,677
The mission you'll do...

461
00:14:58,678 --> 00:14:59,808
- with Cameraman Lee Kang Yul is... - What is it?

462
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:02,308
It's Photo Time with the Elephant Nose.

463
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,947
- I see. - All of you...

464
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:05,178
will stand at the starting line.

465
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:07,918
You will make the elephant nose, turn ten times, and run.

466
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:10,057
The camera is set to take a picture in 15 seconds.

467
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:11,388
And you just have to be in the picture.

468
00:15:11,688 --> 00:15:13,157
All of your eyes, nose, and mouth...

469
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:14,488
must be in the picture to complete the mission.

470
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:15,827
Is this the photo zone?

471
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:16,898
- That's right. - Okay.

472
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,257
I bet you won't have a problem making turns.

473
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:20,268
Over there.

474
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:22,327
(They're bound to look forward...)

475
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:25,168
(to the cameraman's sense of balance as he works with Steadicam.)

476
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:26,667
- For your information. - Over there.

477
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:27,767
- the camera is... - Do we have to jump?

478
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:29,667
- located quite high up. - We have to jump for it then.

479
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:31,508
You won't be in the picture if you just stand there.

480
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:34,408
- Cameraman Lee, are you ready? - All right. What do we do?

481
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,507
Is anyone confident about counting the seconds?

482
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:39,447
Someone with a good sense of tempo must count like... "One, two..."

483
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:41,147
Then should I count to 15?

484
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,588
- Can you do it? - Sure.

485
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:44,987
- Do you think you can do it? - Yes.

486
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:46,217
Can we practice?

487
00:15:46,218 --> 00:15:47,457
You must do it while turning. We have to hear you count.

488
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,528
Go.

489
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:51,557
One, two, three,

490
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:53,027
- four, five. - He's counting too fast.

491
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:54,327
- You're counting way too fast. - That was too fast.

492
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,698
That was too fast.

493
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:58,838
Let's just finish as fast as we can and come to the zone.

494
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:00,337
- All right. - Okay.

495
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:01,367
We'll go for it.

496
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:03,108
- Let's try it. - Turn as fast as you can.

497
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:04,378
Get ready,

498
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:06,678
set, go.

499
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:10,048
- My gosh. - Two, three, four...

500
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:12,448
- Four, five, six, - Se Yoon...

501
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:14,247
seven, eight...

502
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:15,487
- Count mine. How many? - Ten.

503
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,318
I'm done. All right. Hurry up!

504
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:18,757
Ten. I'm done.

505
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:20,227
(They're done turning with the elephant nose.)

506
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:21,258
Ten seconds.

507
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:22,688
Hold on.

508
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:23,697
- Jump. - Not there.

509
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:24,857
- Where are you going? - Hey.

510
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,958
Ten seconds.

511
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:27,428
Hold on.

512
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:29,668
(Falling down)

513
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:31,967
(But with his core muscles, he returns quickly.)

514
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:33,567
Jump.

515
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:35,438
(Jumping nonstop)

516
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:41,078
(Please let us get one picture.)

517
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:43,748
- Stop. - I think we did it.

518
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:46,178
- I... - We got it.

519
00:16:47,018 --> 00:16:49,817
(The walrus is praying for a completed mission.)

520
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:51,058
Lift it slowly.

521
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:52,787
I see him.

522
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:54,358
- That's Se Yoon. He's in it. - All right.

523
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:55,657
- Really? - I'm in the picture?

524
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:57,057
- All right. - He's in it.

525
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,157
Are you okay?

526
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:00,227
(He has double eyelids due to the fatigue.)

527
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,127
Come on. That's a cheap move with your eyes.

528
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:03,438
I want to be a star.

529
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:04,837
We'll reveal it now.

530
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:06,038
- Slowly. - Let's check.

531
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:08,038
- One. - Reveal it slowly.

532
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:09,868
- Two. - Please.

533
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:11,637
Three.

534
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:14,408
(What's the result?)

535
00:17:14,678 --> 00:17:15,708
Three.

536
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:17,447
(No one else is in the picture.)

537
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:19,278
You guys are so frustrating.

538
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:21,688
He was lying down for five seconds.

539
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:23,818
You were lying down for five seconds.

540
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:25,618
Come on, sir.

541
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,088
(What? How come we're not in the picture?)

542
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,058
- Why aren't we in the picture? - Why aren't we in the picture?

543
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:30,228
Your face isn't...

544
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:33,328
(They jumped first by a close call.)

545
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:37,067
(But Se Yoon who jumped after them was in the picture.)

546
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:39,597
Zoom into my face. Look how it's torturing me.

547
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:40,968
(On the verge of tears)

548
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,408
- Well... - Guys.

549
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,578
Unfortunately, you failed to complete the mission.

550
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:46,707
(We'd like to thank Cameraman Lee for joining us.)

551
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,178
Thank you, Cameraman Lee.

552
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:49,348
Thank you.

553
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:50,748
Where do we have to go next?

554
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:52,818
The meeting room for "Gag Concert." I know where it is.

555
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:54,247
I know where it is.

556
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:56,548
It's where the editing team for our show is.

557
00:17:57,688 --> 00:17:59,657
CG. Makeup Waiting Room.

558
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:00,788
(Basement Level 1 of the new KBS building)

559
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:03,998
I think it might be around here.

560
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:06,028
Right here. Character Generator Room.

561
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:07,997
How did you spot that? My gosh. Hey, you're right.

562
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:09,028
Yes.

563
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:11,768
- My gosh, yes. - Hello.

564
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:13,937
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - Hello.

565
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:14,938
- Hello. - My gosh.

566
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:17,977
(Only the sounds of typing fill the room...)

567
00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:20,448
(that's as quiet as a study hall.)

568
00:18:21,908 --> 00:18:25,518
(The captions of many TV shows are brought to life...)

569
00:18:25,748 --> 00:18:29,747
(in this Character Generator Room.)

570
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:31,088
- "Everyone is furious." - Hello.

571
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,288
- Hello. - "The food stylist remembers it."

572
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:36,787
- This is fascinating. - Are you in charge of...

573
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:38,297
- captions for our show? - Yes.

574
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:40,127
- We all work on your show. - Is that so?

575
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:41,198
- Thank you. - I see.

576
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:43,537
- Thank you for making me look good. - Nice to meet you.

577
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:44,997
- Thank you. - Hello.

578
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,037
- Hello. - Hello.

579
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:48,038
(Kim Jin Ju: In charge of designing captions)

580
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,678
- Is that for our show? - We were working on your show. Yes.

581
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:54,208
That's when Im Woo Il joined us.

582
00:18:54,378 --> 00:18:56,177
My gosh, yes. You're smart.

583
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,417
(Happy to see themselves on the screen)

584
00:18:57,418 --> 00:18:59,948
So you get the edited footage from the directors.

585
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:02,547
Do you add fitting captions to the footage?

586
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:05,617
Yes. The directors send over the captions they want to add.

587
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:07,888
- We design and add the captions. - I see. "This, please."

588
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:11,197
- That's what we do here. - Could you show it to us?

589
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:12,998
- Don't mind us. - Okay.

590
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:15,897
We're not sure if you're just acting or you really do this for a living.

591
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:18,537
We're not sure yet. The jury is still out on that one.

592
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:21,538
I think I can easily put in the caption for "DinDin is DinDin."

593
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:23,807
(We'll reveal how the captions for variety shows are made...)

594
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:25,207
(for the first time in history.)

595
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,607
(How to make captions)

596
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:28,047
(Step 1: Check the captions written by the directors.)

597
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:31,177
(The content of the caption, the name of the template)

598
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:33,378
A lot of time and effort go into that, right?

599
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:35,918
It doesn't come out of thin air.

600
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,917
(Gungseo Font Template for the show's captions)

601
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:41,357
Seriously. She has to add...

602
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:42,758
- all the captions manually. - Seriously.

603
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:44,797
- You must do everything manually. - Yes.

604
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,467
(Step 3: Design the caption as per request.)

605
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:50,267
(The caption in the Gungseo Font is done!)

606
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:52,238
There's a template here.

607
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:54,567
I can do it quite fast.

608
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,707
(Let's time how long it takes to create one caption.)

609
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,807
So...

610
00:19:56,808 --> 00:19:59,237
(She's done in 5 seconds.)

611
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:01,947
The captions must be done manually. Seriously.

612
00:20:01,948 --> 00:20:04,477
- We add them all one by one. - I see.

613
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:07,888
How long does it take to finish one episode?

614
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:09,847
I think it takes more than a day.

615
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:10,987
- And... - Do you stay up all night?

616
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:13,657
I see. There are the names of the directors on the files.

617
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:14,958
Yes, that's right.

618
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:16,998
Which director send over the file late?

619
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:18,498
(Chuckling)

620
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:20,028
Director Kim...

621
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:22,197
- Director Hyun Woo? - Kim...

622
00:20:22,198 --> 00:20:23,368
It's me.

623
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:24,898
- He's the last one to send over? - Yes.

624
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:26,538
Why do you send your file so late?

625
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:29,137
- I'm very thorough when I edit. - That's...

626
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:30,577
- That's right. He's thorough. - I see.

627
00:20:30,578 --> 00:20:32,408
- He's thorough. - Then who's the first one to send?

628
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:33,808
- Right here. - Here.
He's behind us.

629
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:37,117
- It's Director Yu Jae Hyun. - Jae Hyun?

630
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:39,077
- Yes. - He goes around and socializes.

631
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:40,348
I noticed that.

632
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:41,817
Their styles are very different.

633
00:20:41,818 --> 00:20:42,818
How interesting.

634
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:44,988
- Shall we begin the mission now? - Yes.

635
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,087
- Are you sulking? - Gosh, no.

636
00:20:47,088 --> 00:20:48,527
You know what I think?

637
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:50,658
I bet he came up with eight references for this scene.

638
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:52,797
Please do send them over.

639
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:54,067
- Sure. - Great.

640
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:55,698
- What's the mission? - The mission...

641
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:58,097
you will play against her is...

642
00:20:58,098 --> 00:21:00,198
- Who Types Faster. - I can ace this.

643
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:02,267
- Can you type fast? - I type fast.

644
00:21:02,268 --> 00:21:03,507
I practiced it a lot in elementary school.

645
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:05,307
But you must type with your eyes closed.

646
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:06,477
- The person... - With our eyes closed?

647
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:07,907
Who types accurately will win the mission.

648
00:21:07,908 --> 00:21:09,448
I think I might be able to do this.

649
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:12,377
- Nice. - You're good.

650
00:21:12,378 --> 00:21:14,917
So only one of us has to beat her, right?

651
00:21:14,918 --> 00:21:17,287
But if we use the computer keyboard,

652
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:19,557
- she'll have an advantage. - Right.

653
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:20,727
- We'll make it fair. - The phones?

654
00:21:20,728 --> 00:21:22,257
- We... - You'll use your phones.

655
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:23,387
- What is this? - I'm so good at this.

656
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:24,727
- My screen broke. - I don't even have to look.

657
00:21:24,728 --> 00:21:26,257
My screen broke, though.

658
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:28,327
- Come here. - Oh, no.

659
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,367
What is this?

660
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:30,768
- All right. I'm ready. - My gosh, I want to do well.

661
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:32,338
We're ready.

662
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:33,768
Here it is.

663
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:36,137
(Real wild road variety show)

664
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:37,207
(Who are we? 2 Days 1 Night)

665
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,838
- Okay. - You all saw it, right?

666
00:21:39,008 --> 00:21:40,138
Close your eyes.

667
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:43,947
Get ready, set, go.

668
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:45,948
(Their mission begins.)

669
00:21:48,118 --> 00:21:49,748
(Wincing)

670
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:53,988
- I'm done. - Done.

671
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:57,428
Gosh, something doesn't feel right.

672
00:21:58,128 --> 00:22:00,227
- I'm done. - You can't look at it.

673
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:01,497
- I'm done. - No looking.

674
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:02,628
- I'm done. - Let's start with Joon.

675
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:04,338
Show it to us.

676
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:06,338
Come on.

677
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,867
- This is hard, though. - Yes.

678
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:10,067
- Joon failed. - It's hard.

679
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:11,108
Jin Ju.

680
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:13,378
What on earth did you write?

681
00:22:13,638 --> 00:22:15,348
"Namado..." What's that?

682
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:17,817
(Jin Ju...)

683
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:18,848
You failed too.

684
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:20,618
- DinDin. - DinDin was good.

685
00:22:20,848 --> 00:22:22,247
I wrote, "Rag."

686
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:24,258
- But still. You did a great job. - Okay.

687
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:26,917
All of you failed. Here's the next sentence.

688
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:27,987
(Teasing her when they had just met)

689
00:22:27,988 --> 00:22:29,057
(Ashamed)

690
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:30,427
- We'll do this until we succeed? - Yes.

691
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:31,857
- Here's the next sentence. - I think I can do this.

692
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:33,727
- We can do it. - We can do this no matter what.

693
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,867
- "The acorns are rolling down." - I...

694
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:36,868
Go.

695
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:39,897
(The acorns...)

696
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:41,537
(are...)

697
00:22:41,538 --> 00:22:43,468
(Will DinDin succeed?)

698
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:45,008
- I'm done. - I'm done.

699
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,177
- I'm done. - Show it to us, Jin Ju.

700
00:22:47,178 --> 00:22:48,207
Gosh, I...

701
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,677
(She fails again.)

702
00:22:49,678 --> 00:22:50,778
Okay.

703
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:52,147
Show it to us.

704
00:22:52,148 --> 00:22:54,488
Hey, I have the auto-correct mode on.

705
00:22:54,818 --> 00:22:56,888
- The last part was on auto-correct. - Wrong.

706
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,917
(He was so close to completing the mission.)

707
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:00,928
I'm done.

708
00:23:01,488 --> 00:23:03,287
(He had set the birds as auto-correct.)

709
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:04,927
- Wrong. - I have the auto-correct mode on.

710
00:23:04,928 --> 00:23:07,467
I set the pigeon emotions as auto-correct.

711
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:08,497
- Wrong. - I...

712
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:09,727
- You have to accept this. - Look.

713
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:11,068
- I got everything else right. - Wrong.

714
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:12,537
- Why? It's the auto-correct mode. - You...

715
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:13,938
- You must turn it off. - It's the phone's fault.

716
00:23:14,138 --> 00:23:16,167
You're the one who set up the phone. And it's your phone.

717
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:17,637
- My gosh. - I...

718
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:18,907
- It's the phone's fault. - Look at this.

719
00:23:18,908 --> 00:23:19,908
- Show us. - Look.

720
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:21,777
When I type in "down," this is what shows up.

721
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:23,947
When I try to put in a period, it gets corrected on its own.

722
00:23:23,948 --> 00:23:25,648
You should have turned off the auto-correct.

723
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:28,148
I only set it up to look hip.

724
00:23:29,448 --> 00:23:30,617
This is so annoying.

725
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:31,788
(He was copying zoomers.)

726
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:33,958
Jin Ju.

727
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:36,388
"Grilled Cost." Wrong.

728
00:23:36,758 --> 00:23:38,627
(Grilled toast by CODE KUNST)

729
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:40,667
- It's over. - You won the mission.

730
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:41,628
(DinDin completes the mission.)

731
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:44,537
I used to do this all the time when I was in school.

732
00:23:44,538 --> 00:23:46,097
- I'm so used to this. - During class?

733
00:23:46,098 --> 00:23:47,608
- I always texted during class. - Like this?

734
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,967
Here's the spot for the next mission.

735
00:23:49,968 --> 00:23:50,977
- By the way... - But...

736
00:23:50,978 --> 00:23:52,407
- "Go to the Announcers' Room." - "Go to the Announcers' Room."

737
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:53,637
The Announcers' Room in KBS.

738
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:55,247
Do you know where the Announcers' Room is?

739
00:23:55,248 --> 00:23:56,377
The Announcers' Room...

740
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:58,647
- Go to the main building. - Yes, it must be there.

741
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:00,318
- Thank you. - Thank you.

742
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:02,117
- Thank you. - Bye.

743
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:04,118
- My gosh, that was easy. - Goodness.

744
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:05,757
Seon Ho. We'll be there soon.

745
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,117
Of course, I know my way around here.

746
00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:08,658
How do you know about the symphony orchestra?

747
00:24:09,488 --> 00:24:10,597
Hold on. Let's go this way.

748
00:24:10,598 --> 00:24:12,327
Offices are usually here. Okay?

749
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:13,627
Jong Min, I see a lot of offices.

750
00:24:13,628 --> 00:24:15,798
Yes. The offices are here. Let's check this place out.

751
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:18,197
- KBS Hall. - Symphony Orchestra.

752
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:19,338
Yes, I told you.

753
00:24:20,508 --> 00:24:21,967
- This is the office. - Hello.

754
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:22,968
Right here.

755
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:24,707
(Is this the right office?)

756
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,708
Hello.

757
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:27,407
- Hello. - Hello.

758
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:29,177
It's right here. I see. Hello.

759
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:30,377
(They finally found the Symphony Orchestra's office.)

760
00:24:30,378 --> 00:24:33,888
(KBS Symphony Orchestra)

761
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,417
(The orchestra is led...)

762
00:24:35,418 --> 00:24:36,488
(by the world-renowned maestro, Chung Myung Whun.)

763
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:39,057
(He is guiding the classical music industry...)

764
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:41,028
(of Korea into a brighter future.)

765
00:24:41,658 --> 00:24:45,758
(This is the office of the KBS Symphony Orchestra.)

766
00:24:46,328 --> 00:24:47,967
- Hello. - Hello.

767
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:49,867
- Okay. We're here for the mission. - Okay.

768
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,698
(Director Seo Young Jae, in charge of the YouTube channel)

769
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:55,168
(The channel of the orchestra had been peaceful.)

770
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:58,408
(Then an entertaining vibe stormed into the channel.)

771
00:24:58,738 --> 00:25:01,348
("Requiem: Gung Ye" received 1.65 million views.)

772
00:25:02,008 --> 00:25:04,518
("Kang Ho Dong Concerto" received 2.3 million views.)

773
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:06,677
(I laughed so hard that my whole body is aching.)

774
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:08,347
(You posted it before the holidays, so you won't get calls, right?)

775
00:25:08,348 --> 00:25:10,017
(Did the editor post it without the approval?)

776
00:25:10,018 --> 00:25:12,017
(Subscribers)

777
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:14,658
(Subscribers: 180,000)

778
00:25:15,158 --> 00:25:17,598
(He recently created "Kim Jong Min Concerto.")

779
00:25:17,828 --> 00:25:20,728
(The best editor of the orchestra)

780
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:23,627
People rarely watch videos about classical music.

781
00:25:23,628 --> 00:25:25,897
So I thought about how I could incorporate...

782
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:28,108
- the YouTube style into the videos. - Yes.

783
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:32,077
I grew up watching 2 Days 1 Night as a kid.

784
00:25:32,078 --> 00:25:34,878
So I used the resources of KBS shows.

785
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:36,647
I came up with the idea of making a video like this.

786
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:38,317
But I had no idea you would come.

787
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:39,548
- I see. - Gosh.

788
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:41,987
You will do a mission...

789
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:44,088
against the true fan of our show, Director Seo Young Jae.

790
00:25:44,218 --> 00:25:46,217
- We have to play against him? - Against him?

791
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:48,228
- It will be 2-on-1. - Okay.

792
00:25:48,388 --> 00:25:49,887
The mission is...

793
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:51,427
Guess the Legendary Memes of 2 Days 1 Night.

794
00:25:51,428 --> 00:25:52,698
(Guess the Legendary Memes of 2 Days 1 Night)

795
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:55,297
I was an avid viewer of 2 Days 1 Night.

796
00:25:55,298 --> 00:25:56,528
- I was on the show. - I...

797
00:25:57,438 --> 00:25:58,697
- Right. - I watched everything in person.

798
00:25:58,698 --> 00:25:59,738
Right.

799
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:01,637
You will look at the legendary meme from the show...

800
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:03,838
and guess the caption that goes in the meme.

801
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:06,438
We'll give you five questions.

802
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:08,707
You must guess three questions correctly before him...

803
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:09,878
to complete the mission.

804
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:13,378
(The hardcore fan of the show, Director Seo Young Jae)

805
00:26:13,778 --> 00:26:15,087
(Avid viewer of 2 Days 1 Night, Yoo Seon Ho)

806
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:16,388
(They were born around the same time.)

807
00:26:17,018 --> 00:26:19,557
(Who will win this match?)

808
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:21,658
Here's your first question.

809
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:23,557
I'm sorry to interrupt.

810
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:25,058
- Could you flip it like this? - Okay.

811
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:26,928
- He could see it before us. - He... Gosh, nice.

812
00:26:27,228 --> 00:26:28,697
- Games must be fair. - This is a sensitive issue.

813
00:26:28,698 --> 00:26:29,768
Of course.

814
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:32,467
(They're more childish than I thought.)

815
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:33,768
Here's the first question.

816
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,637
- All right. Okay. - I got it.

817
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,278
(New workout equipment, selling out fast)

818
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:42,878
(That was fast.)

819
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:44,348
Pig Slide.

820
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:45,918
That's correct.

821
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,178
(Pig Slide)

822
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,518
(Seon Ho guesses it in 1 second.)

823
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:51,118
(Did you see that?)

824
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,988
I told you I watched everything. It was on Heuksan Island.

825
00:26:53,188 --> 00:26:54,788
- Did you know? - Yes, of course.

826
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:56,657
But I only remember the scene.

827
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,057
- Not the caption. - Not the caption.

828
00:26:58,058 --> 00:26:59,598
- Pig Slide. - Slide.

829
00:26:59,758 --> 00:27:01,927
I was a huge fan. I was your biggest fan.

830
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:05,338
From what I remember, it was in 2009. Was it?

831
00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:06,738
Was it 2010?

832
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:09,307
(He was doing sit-ups to avoid catching skates.)

833
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:11,578
(It aired on January 24, 2010 and was filmed on Heuksan Island.)

834
00:27:12,408 --> 00:27:13,937
(Seung Gi couldn't withstand Ho Dong's power...)

835
00:27:13,938 --> 00:27:15,408
(while holding his legs.)

836
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:18,377
(New workout equipment)

837
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:21,548
(Pig Slide)

838
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:24,758
Do you now realize how big of a fan I was?

839
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:26,257
- Gosh, you watched our show a lot. - I was a huge fan of yours.

840
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:27,358
- You did watch it a lot. - Yes.

841
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:30,898
(This guy is getting utterly anxious.)

842
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:32,157
- Are you all right? - My gosh.

843
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:33,158
(Laughing)

844
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:35,598
(His ego is bruised.)

845
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:37,228
Here's the second question.

846
00:27:38,568 --> 00:27:41,337
(Su Geun's secret weapon)

847
00:27:41,338 --> 00:27:42,407
- I got it. - I know this one.

848
00:27:42,408 --> 00:27:43,908
(I recognize this scene too.)

849
00:27:44,178 --> 00:27:45,477
- I know what this is. - It's...

850
00:27:45,478 --> 00:27:46,837
- Perverted Dance. - Wrong.

851
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:48,078
What? That's wrong?

852
00:27:48,678 --> 00:27:50,108
- Zangief? - Wrong.

853
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:51,518
Zangief?

854
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,087
- There was a scene about it too. - Really?

855
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:55,548
But that wasn't the same makeup.

856
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:57,418
That day, Su Geun...

857
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:00,058
When I saw him, I thought it was so gross.

858
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:03,787
- The paulownia leaf dance. - Oh, right.

859
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:04,858
- Correct. - Yes.

860
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:06,628
- What was his perverted dance then? - My gosh.

861
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:09,167
I did the perverted dance.

862
00:28:09,168 --> 00:28:10,998
- You started it? - He did the paulownia leaf dance.

863
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:12,438
- I see. - The paulownia leaf dance.

864
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:16,238
(It was just gross to watch him dance.)

865
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:20,878
(But when it was paired with the song, it became a hit.)

866
00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:23,948
(It became Su Geun's signature dance.)

867
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:27,348
(Su Geun's specialty, the paulownia leaf dance)

868
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:28,987
- Do you remember it now? - Yes.

869
00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:30,117
I remember it too.

870
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:31,357
Since we answered two questions,

871
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:33,118
- we'll give you a chance. - Okay.

872
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:35,727
(Offended)

873
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:37,898
Director, you may turn the page like this now.

874
00:28:39,598 --> 00:28:41,968
(Mocking brothers)

875
00:28:42,168 --> 00:28:43,468
The current score is 2 to 0.

876
00:28:43,968 --> 00:28:45,668
Here's the third question.

877
00:28:46,868 --> 00:28:48,407
(Jeju Camping Car Trip)

878
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:50,307
- I got it. - This one is so easy.

879
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:51,478
"As long as it's not me."

880
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:53,608
(Is it correct?)

881
00:28:53,978 --> 00:28:55,048
Correct.

882
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:58,247
(Gosh, what a relief.)

883
00:28:58,248 --> 00:28:59,417
I thought he was calling Seung Gi.

884
00:28:59,418 --> 00:29:00,718
- Seung Gi. - "Seung Gi."

885
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:06,718
(To survive during the atrocious random game)

886
00:29:07,418 --> 00:29:11,397
(Ho Dong's famous phrase that he shouted desperately)

887
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:14,168
(As long as it's not me.)

888
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:16,868
- Is it 2 to 1? - Yes.

889
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:19,298
- We'll end the game. - We'll end the game.

890
00:29:19,498 --> 00:29:20,938
It's time to move on.

891
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:24,538
(If Jong Min and Seon Ho get it right, they will win.)

892
00:29:25,438 --> 00:29:27,577
(If Director Young Jae gets it, the score will tie.)

893
00:29:27,578 --> 00:29:29,078
Here's your fourth question.

894
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:30,747
(House)

895
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:31,748
I got it.

896
00:29:31,918 --> 00:29:34,488
(Director Young Jae failed to raise his hand fast enough.)

897
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:37,018
(What will be Seon Ho's answer?)

898
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:38,365
(What will be Seon Ho's answer?)

899
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:39,419
House.

900
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:41,529
House.

901
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:43,559
- Correct. - Yes.

902
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,899
(Seon Ho got it right.)

903
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:47,468
(Disappointed)

904
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:48,568
I'm a huge fan of 2 Days 1 Night.

905
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:49,629
For real.

906
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,938
- Yes, we'll get to eat lunch. - Here's the location...

907
00:29:51,939 --> 00:29:53,239
- for the next mission. - Is there more?

908
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,538
(Go to the video mastering room.)

909
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:57,278
Where is the video mastering room?

910
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,479
- Video mastering room. - Video mastering room?

911
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:01,509
- I only know this place. - Really?

912
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:04,378
- Because you only work here? - The building is huge.

913
00:30:04,379 --> 00:30:05,418
I see.

914
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:08,018
We look forward to seeing more of your work.

915
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,188
- Thank you for joining us. - It was an honor.

916
00:30:09,189 --> 00:30:10,318
Thank you.

917
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,489
- We're rooting for you. - Thank you.

918
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:13,659
I'm a fan of 2 Days 1 Night.

919
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:15,659
I watch it every time I eat.

920
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:18,059
I was saying, "What's wrong with his voice?"

921
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:20,628
Gosh, it's Research Building. I've only been here a few times.

922
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:21,729
I haven't been here in a while.

923
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:24,538
Yes, Research Building. It's this place.

924
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:25,539
That's right.

925
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,909
- You. - You should go.

926
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:32,539
(Full of passion and spirit for comedy)

927
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:34,048
("Gag Concert")

928
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:36,449
Here it is. "Gag Concert."

929
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:39,179
- Hello. - Hello.

930
00:30:39,349 --> 00:30:40,518
- Gosh. - Hello.

931
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,189
(From the entrance of the "Gag Concert" meeting room)

932
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:44,518
- How dare you come here? - The "Gag Concert" office.

933
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,658
Jong Hoon.

934
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,389
- Hello, Jong Hoon. - Who is this?

935
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,789
- Hello. - Gosh, Jong Hoon.

936
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:50,459
Jong Hoon is my friend from high school.

937
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,029
We went to Myungduk High School.

938
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:55,268
- Were you in the same class? - Yes.

939
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:56,639
Myungduk High School.

940
00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:58,468
Can we sit down?

941
00:30:58,469 --> 00:31:00,009
- Can we sit down? - Please sit.

942
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,508
Research Building moved from the other side.

943
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:05,038
Yes, it got moved.

944
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,338
- We know about it. - I see.

945
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:08,149
- We also know about it. - We do.

946
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:10,278
Jong Hoon appeared on "Gag Concert" for the first time...

947
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,748
- with Jin Young. - Who?

948
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:13,179
- Kwon Jin Young. - I see.

949
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:14,848
Wasn't your segment about ginkgo trees?

950
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:17,118
- It was about foreigners. - That's right.

951
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,318
Isn't that it?

952
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,659
(Acting like a foreigner)

953
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:22,128
He was saying something about...

954
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:23,498
how ginkgo trees smell strong in Korea.

955
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:25,058
- Where was it? - Do you remember that?

956
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:26,968
Of course. You had just joined with Jin Young.

957
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,168
- Right. - Yes.

958
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:29,798
We brainstormed ideas together during break.

959
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:32,298
Jong Hoon was studying physical education.

960
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:33,638
- College of Physical Education. - That's where he went.

961
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:34,869
After that...

962
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:37,708
(He's itching to do the mission right away.)

963
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:39,478
I went to school for comedy acting.

964
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:40,549
That's enough.

965
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:42,179
Sae Ho.

966
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,479
(Please talk to each other in private.)

967
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:46,419
The mission with the "Gag Concert" team is...

968
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:48,649
Make the Other Laugh, Tazzang.

969
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:51,059
Tazzang?

970
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:55,128
(A 1-to-1 comedy competition...)

971
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:58,198
(where you must make the opponent laugh in order to win)

972
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,199
(This is Sae Ho.)

973
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,328
(With a unique mask comedy)

974
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:02,828
(This is Sae Ho again.)

975
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:03,868
(This is also Sae Ho.)

976
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:07,269
(The show that resulted in Cho Sae Ho's premier heyday)

977
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:09,469
Se Yoon whom every comedian dreams of becoming.

978
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:10,778
Everyone wants to be like me?

979
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:12,409
And Sae Ho, the legend of Tazzang.

980
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,278
If they make the "Gag Concert" team laugh,

981
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,549
they'll clear the mission.

982
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:18,019
All right.

983
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:20,548
(All we have to do is hold our laughter.)

984
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:22,389
- I want to laugh. - This will be fun.

985
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:25,388
I don't know if I'm as funny as before.

986
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:26,658
As he lost weight,

987
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:28,059
he lost all his sense of humor.

988
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:30,228
Back then, he had a huge belly.

989
00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:31,258
(Imposing?)

990
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:33,098
- Will it be funny? - This is...

991
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:34,228
(Sae Ho who lost weight)

992
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:35,469
(How will he keep his sense of pride for Tazzang?)

993
00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:37,098
Why don't Hyeon Ho and...

994
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:38,199
- Hyun Young. - Hyun Young?

995
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:39,368
That sounds good.

996
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:41,138
(The candidates to play against the members)

997
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:43,039
Hyun Young has a shoot for a music video.

998
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:44,338
- When? - It's a little later.

999
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:46,038
I have a music video shoot for "To Lady" today.

1000
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,178
Really?

1001
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:48,778
- With... - With Pill Keun.

1002
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,278
Song Pill Keun?

1003
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,918
- That's him. - He sings very well.

1004
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,979
(Singing out of the blue)

1005
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:55,248
She's very impressive.

1006
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:56,518
(She promotes herself right away.)

1007
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:58,288
I like her boldness.

1008
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:00,128
Please show a lot of love for this song.

1009
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:02,689
Starting on March 16, "Gag Concert..."

1010
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,698
("Gag Concert" airs on Sunday night at 9:20pm.)

1011
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:06,329
- Did the time change? - Everyone.

1012
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:08,698
- Please watch "Gag Concert." - Of course.

1013
00:33:08,699 --> 00:33:09,999
- That's great. - All right.

1014
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:11,938
- Okay. - Good job.

1015
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:13,168
Now,

1016
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:14,868
Hyeon Ho and Hyun Young will play.

1017
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:15,869
Okay.

1018
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,739
- Let's see. - Hyun Young is impressive.

1019
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,778
- I'm jealous of you. - She's good.

1020
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:21,208
- She's really good. - I can see that.

1021
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:23,248
Let's go to the prop room.

1022
00:33:23,249 --> 00:33:24,578
- Okay. - Good luck.

1023
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:25,719
Where do we go?

1024
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:27,718
("Gag Concert" prop room)

1025
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:28,749
There it is.

1026
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:32,589
(Various props welcome the legend of Tazzang.)

1027
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,189
What should we do?

1028
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:37,428
(Selecting props carefully)

1029
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:38,499
What should we do?

1030
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,098
What do you want to do? I'll go first.

1031
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:42,369
- Do you want to go first? - Should we do it together?

1032
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:45,038
- You're on a different level. - No, I'm not.

1033
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,409
(How will the legend of Tazzang make them laugh?)

1034
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:52,539
Tazzang returns in 2025.

1035
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:55,809
- Are you ready? - We are.

1036
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:58,979
- Shall we go? - Yes.

1037
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:00,888
This is Team 2 Days 1 Night.

1038
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,519
(Sae Ho goes first.)

1039
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:04,989
KBS Sports News.

1040
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:07,289
Lastly, here's the highlight...

1041
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:09,858
of World Swimming Championships.

1042
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:11,459
Have a good night, everyone.

1043
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:14,129
(The sports news ends.)

1044
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:18,199
(Chuckling)

1045
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:19,799
(Flinching)

1046
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:22,539
(The 1st crisis with his flinching lips)

1047
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:24,979
(Gurgling)

1048
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:26,739
(Drinking)

1049
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,549
(Peekaboo)

1050
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,979
(He's about to burst out laughing.)

1051
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:33,219
(Hyeon Ho, you must hold it.)

1052
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:35,489
(He somehow evaded the 1st crisis.)

1053
00:34:36,189 --> 00:34:38,989
(Feeling anxious, he looks busy from the back.)

1054
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:41,958
Five, four, three...

1055
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,088
(Tazzang legend, show him what you've got.)

1056
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:44,098
Two.

1057
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:45,699
Five, four...

1058
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:47,769
(Poking out)

1059
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:49,869
(This time, he became a synchronized swimmer.)

1060
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:51,699
One.

1061
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:53,099
(Splashing)

1062
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,969
(Trying not to move)

1063
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:56,109
One.

1064
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,478
(Failure)

1065
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:59,208
At the last moment...

1066
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:00,479
At the last moment...

1067
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,278
- Did we win? - At the last moment...

1068
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:03,819
- We have one more. - Do you?

1069
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:06,278
(Bursting out laughing)

1070
00:35:06,279 --> 00:35:07,889
- I can't... - What made you laugh?

1071
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:09,718
He was working so hard.

1072
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,088
(Respect)

1073
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:12,388
He was working so hard.

1074
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:14,488
(The reality hits him.)

1075
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:15,629
Don't think.

1076
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:18,729
Don't think about anything.

1077
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,668
Your age or experience isn't important.

1078
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:22,198
- It reminded me of... - Don't think about anything.

1079
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,328
It's all right.

1080
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,638
You made him laugh. It's okay.

1081
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,839
Sae Ho made him laugh.

1082
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:29,269
That was great.

1083
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:30,879
- Was it okay? - It was Tazzang.

1084
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:32,638
Where is it?

1085
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,048
(Jong Min and Seon Ho look for the second location.)

1086
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,279
Let's go in there.

1087
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:37,218
- Mastering. - Okay.

1088
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:38,378
It says video mastering.

1089
00:35:38,379 --> 00:35:40,489
Okay. Here it is.

1090
00:35:40,649 --> 00:35:42,189
Here it is. We finally found it.

1091
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:43,918
Did you see that?

1092
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:45,488
- Did you see that? - Yes.

1093
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:46,489
What's that?

1094
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,888
- Hello. - Hello.

1095
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:49,659
- What? It's you, Jong Min. - It's me.

1096
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:52,229
(Jong Min is on the screen.)

1097
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:55,098
- Hello. - When was this shot?

1098
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:56,099
When is it from?

1099
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,898
Are you editing? What are you doing?

1100
00:35:57,899 --> 00:35:59,438
I'm on the 2 Days 1 Night team,

1101
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:01,368
and I'm in charge of color correction.

1102
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:02,438
- Color correction? - Color correction?

1103
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:03,638
I'm Shin Hwa Soo.

1104
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:05,179
- Hwa Soo? Hello. - Hello.

1105
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:06,739
Has that been corrected?

1106
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:08,878
No, this is the original screen.

1107
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:09,879
It's the original?

1108
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,218
- Yes. - And you correct it?

1109
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:12,878
It needs a lot of correction.

1110
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,989
Your teeth stand out so much.

1111
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:16,718
Can you get rid of my wrinkles?

1112
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,758
- Shall I try it? - Yes.

1113
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,659
- Please show us. - Sure.

1114
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,159
(He's excited to get rid of his wrinkles.)

1115
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,228
This is fascinating.

1116
00:36:23,229 --> 00:36:24,528
I didn't know about this.

1117
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:26,259
When I push this...

1118
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:29,299
- My skin looks so clean. - Like this.

1119
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:33,269
(Jong Min became young again after one click.)

1120
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:35,638
(Fascinated)

1121
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:37,739
It looks overdone.

1122
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:39,308
I like it.

1123
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:40,378
- Really? - Yes.

1124
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:42,009
My skin looks so clean.

1125
00:36:42,379 --> 00:36:45,319
Can you turn Jong Min's face to green?

1126
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:46,918
(Hesitating)

1127
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:48,249
- It's possible. - Like "Avatar?"

1128
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:50,759
As much as possible... What's going on?

1129
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,789
It's like when you're drunk.

1130
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:54,089
(Strange)

1131
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,258
What? That's fascinating.

1132
00:36:56,259 --> 00:36:57,899
So it's possible to change the color.

1133
00:36:58,529 --> 00:36:59,998
Can we air...

1134
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:02,828
his face looking like this just once?

1135
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:03,938
- Seriously. - Just one cut?

1136
00:37:03,939 --> 00:37:05,038
Just one cut.

1137
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,769
Why are we here anyway?

1138
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:10,308
You will clear the next mission with the director...

1139
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:11,979
- of color correction. - Okay.

1140
00:37:12,139 --> 00:37:13,708
The mission is called...

1141
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,609
Sand Lance Coffee Game.

1142
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:16,849
Please bring it.

1143
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:18,548
(Nervous, relaxed)

1144
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:19,649
This is easy.

1145
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:20,819
You know, right?

1146
00:37:21,419 --> 00:37:23,349
(Speaking of Kim Jong Min)

1147
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,789
(18 years of experience)

1148
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:28,529
(He's a legend in this field.)

1149
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:31,959
(He passes with whatever he picks.)

1150
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:36,099
(The deity of random games)

1151
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:39,899
(Sand Lance Coffee? That's nothing.)

1152
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:43,609
(Plus, the chance of winning is one-third.)

1153
00:37:43,909 --> 00:37:46,008
In this mission, the three of you will be...

1154
00:37:46,009 --> 00:37:47,808
- on the same team. - On the same team?

1155
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,608
- What? - If the director picks...

1156
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:51,618
real Americano,

1157
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:53,719
the members will drink it up.

1158
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:55,019
- What he picks? - Yes.

1159
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:57,688
We need to help him out if it's a team game.

1160
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:59,618
- Right. - Since he makes color corrections,

1161
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:01,658
he's an expert at recognizing colors.

1162
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:03,129
- That's true. - Okay.

1163
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,528
Out of the 3, only 1 is different.

1164
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:08,268
- He's an expert. - Right.

1165
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:10,128
He recognizes the tiniest difference...

1166
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:11,639
- in colors. - Right.

1167
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:13,098
(Director, it isn't hard.)

1168
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:15,508
Wait, let me look at them from the front.

1169
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:17,878
- Take a look again carefully. - Carefully.

1170
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,909
He's good indeed.

1171
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:20,448
He always corrects colors.

1172
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:21,478
That's right.

1173
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:23,608
- On the other hand, we... - We can't tell the difference.

1174
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:24,978
- We wouldn't know. - We wouldn't recognize,

1175
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:26,179
- but he would. - Right.

1176
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:27,518
Look how careful he is.

1177
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,688
(Pressuring to the max)

1178
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:29,849
He's close to being a genius.

1179
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:31,789
Don't resent me. Number one.

1180
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:33,959
- Number 1? - I'll go with number 1.

1181
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,859
(Am I wrong?)

1182
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,959
(He gives them a look begging for help.)

1183
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:39,258
It's up to you.

1184
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:40,428
(Ignoring his demand)

1185
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:41,728
- What... - I pick number one.

1186
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:44,368
Does number one look different?

1187
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:45,569
It's possible.

1188
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:47,769
- This one is... - Yes?

1189
00:38:48,169 --> 00:38:52,179
- slightly dark brown. - Okay.

1190
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,679
These two are light brown.

1191
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:57,648
There's more yellow to it.

1192
00:38:57,649 --> 00:38:58,718
Yellow?

1193
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,849
(Number 2 and 3 have some yellow in them.)

1194
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:03,548
(Did the director pick the right one?)

1195
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,488
Your choice is number one.

1196
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:08,258
- Two of you will drink it up. - This is it.

1197
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:10,598
- Seon Ho will drink number one... - You drink it together.

1198
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,759
We drink it together?

1199
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:13,198
- In one go. - Here you go.

1200
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:15,698
- You're the expert, so I trust you. - Okay.

1201
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:16,928
Even if you spit it out...

1202
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:18,168
I won't spit it out.

1203
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:20,068
- What? - I'll wipe the floor.

1204
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:21,468
Don't spit it out in the cup while I'm drinking it.

1205
00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:22,469
Okay.

1206
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,609
(Let's do this together.)

1207
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:25,879
All right.

1208
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:27,949
This is always nerve-racking.

1209
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:30,178
- He's a genius in colors. - Right.

1210
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:31,719
(The director is also nervous.)

1211
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:34,549
- We'll drink it. Two, three. - One, two, three.

1212
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:45,259
(What does the future hold for them?)

1213
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,829
(Coming up)

1214
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:54,039
(Six friends come to KBS.)

1215
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:55,968
- They're coming. - Who are they?

1216
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:57,379
- It's my friend. - Really?

1217
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:02,848
(They end up entering the world of variety shows.)

1218
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:03,849
Seriously?

1219
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:06,119
It's really them.

1220
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:11,218
(Their friends will be revealed in a moment.)

1221
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:12,618
(Joon and DinDin return to the main building.)

1222
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,619
(Go to the Announcers' Room.)

1223
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,629
Going to the Announcers' Room...

1224
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,559
I don't know anyone there.

1225
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:19,159
Announcers' Room?

1226
00:40:19,229 --> 00:40:21,599
- Here it is. - Here it is. It's easy to find.

1227
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:23,299
- It's easy. - This place seems intimidating.

1228
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:29,069
(News, radio, culture, and sports)

1229
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:33,479
(Where deliverers who represent KBS are gathered)

1230
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:39,018
(Announcers' Room)

1231
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,548
- Hello. - Hello.

1232
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:43,418
- Hello, ma'am. - Hello.

1233
00:40:43,419 --> 00:40:45,588
- Hello. - We were told to come here.

1234
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:47,058
Is Eun Hye here?

1235
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:48,288
Yes, that's me.

1236
00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:51,198
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Hello.

1237
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,558
- Hello, DinDin and Joon. - Have you been well?

1238
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:54,628
How about you?

1239
00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:56,498
- She was on 2 Days 1 Night often. - You must be the new member.

1240
00:40:56,499 --> 00:40:59,439
I was on the show from time to time. I'm Announcer Eom Ji In.

1241
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,809
(The main host on "Morning Forum" that symbolizes KBS)

1242
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:08,279
(Announcer Eom Ji In, joined KBS in 2007)

1243
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:09,808
This is Announcer Jung Eun Hye.

1244
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:12,019
- She's the youngest announcer. - Right.

1245
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,348
(The youngest in KBS Announcers' Room)

1246
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,418
(Announcer Jung Eun Hye, joined KBS in 2023)

1247
00:41:19,419 --> 00:41:21,258
At KBS Entertainment Awards...

1248
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:22,729
- Do you remember that? - Did you see it?

1249
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:23,998
As kespa.

1250
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:25,329
Did you perform during the opening?

1251
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:29,298
(Performed as kespa to honor aespa)

1252
00:41:29,299 --> 00:41:31,168
(Announcer Jung Eun Hye)

1253
00:41:31,169 --> 00:41:32,968
("KBS' KARINA, Jung Eun Hye. New Announcer Who Has Everything")

1254
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:34,508
She played KARINA.

1255
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:35,608
(She played KARINA in front of real KARINA.)

1256
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:37,139
Joon is KARINA's fan.

1257
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:38,408
What is he saying?

1258
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:40,238
He's talking nonsense.

1259
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,878
- Don't you like KARINA? I do. - Why are you...

1260
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:43,108
Of course I do.

1261
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:45,478
- Who doesn't like KARINA? - Exactly.

1262
00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:48,418
Is this the entire announcers' room?

1263
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:50,988
No, this is part of it. There's another room over there.

1264
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:52,158
- Really? - Yes.

1265
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:55,488
We have almost 80 announcers.

1266
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:56,928
- Are there that many? - That many?

1267
00:41:56,929 --> 00:41:59,729
- You can see all of us. - Yes, we have it here.

1268
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:01,528
- There are so many of you. - Yes.

1269
00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:04,638
There are so many. Where can we find them all?

1270
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:07,168
KBS has many radio shows.

1271
00:42:07,169 --> 00:42:09,208
Radio 1, 2, and 3.

1272
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:13,009
There are Hanminjok News and international news.

1273
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:15,578
We announce news every hour.

1274
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:17,009
So we have announcers for each program.

1275
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:20,149
Isn't she related to Hyun Moo?

1276
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:22,088
Ju Yeon, someone is looking for you.

1277
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:23,748
- With Hyun Moo, she keeps... - Ju Yeon.

1278
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,988
Oh, that's right.

1279
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:26,188
(The woman related to Jun Hyun Moo gets up shyly.)

1280
00:42:26,189 --> 00:42:27,258
It's her.

1281
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:30,128
(Well known through "Boss in the Mirror")

1282
00:42:30,129 --> 00:42:31,728
("Romance Between Jun Hyun Moo And Female Announcer")

1283
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:33,128
(Embarrassed)

1284
00:42:33,129 --> 00:42:38,869
(Hong Ju Yeon, Jun Hyun Moo's unofficial girlfriend)

1285
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:40,709
Why doesn't anyone refute it?

1286
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:43,039
I'm not in any place to refute.

1287
00:42:43,669 --> 00:42:44,738
Ju Yeon, come over here.

1288
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:45,739
(Announcer Hong Ju Yeon joins them.)

1289
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,379
Are you a rookie announcer?

1290
00:42:47,509 --> 00:42:48,578
I'm the second youngest.

1291
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:51,048
- She's the youngest. - I'm the last one.

1292
00:42:51,049 --> 00:42:52,648
She's the second youngest.

1293
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:54,619
The third youngest, Kim Jin Woong, come over here.

1294
00:42:55,219 --> 00:42:56,418
- Kim Jin Woong. - Jin Woong.

1295
00:42:56,419 --> 00:42:58,759
I'm sure that he's watching Jun Hyun Moo.

1296
00:42:58,959 --> 00:42:59,988
2 Days...

1297
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:01,088
That's intense.

1298
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:02,928
He's watching 2 Days 1 Night.

1299
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:05,198
- Isn't that a setup? - Isn't that deliberate?

1300
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:06,229
Hello.

1301
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:09,328
Isn't watching 2 Days 1 Night so deliberate?

1302
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:11,199
- That's so intentional. - What if we...

1303
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:13,239
What if we never talked to him?

1304
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:14,538
Did you have a shoot today?

1305
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:16,268
No, I...

1306
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:19,108
- I usually get my makeup done. - You're all made up.

1307
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:20,848
It's to receive good energy.

1308
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:22,109
I'm your huge fan.

1309
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:24,248
- Really? - Twenty years ago,

1310
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:25,518
I went to your high school performance.

1311
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,618
Hold on. Why?

1312
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:29,348
My first love was in your class.

1313
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:31,118
So you've seen me when I was a dancer?

1314
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,358
Wasn't it at Sejong Center for the Performing Arts?

1315
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,359
You came to that?

1316
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:37,058
- I performed in the main theater. - Was it in 2005?

1317
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:38,098
He attended it.

1318
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:39,698
He even prepared a story.

1319
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:41,598
What if we never talked to him?

1320
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,099
- That's fine. - Seriously,

1321
00:43:43,169 --> 00:43:44,838
I thought that you were working hard.

1322
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:45,969
I couldn't talk to you.

1323
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:48,338
Could you introduce yourself?

1324
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:50,468
I'm Announcer Kim Jin Woong at KBS.

1325
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:54,948
(A sportscaster with Conan's voice)

1326
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:59,148
(Jin Woong is known to be a huge fan of Hyun Moo.)

1327
00:43:59,149 --> 00:44:01,018
Since you're here, please have a seat.

1328
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:02,488
- This is the guest room... - Have a seat here.

1329
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:03,948
Of the announcers' room.

1330
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:04,958
(Acting like journalists)

1331
00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:08,188
When I watch KBS announcers...

1332
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:09,959
- these days, - Yes?

1333
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:12,198
They seem more brazen than before.

1334
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:13,259
- Why? - In what way?

1335
00:44:13,429 --> 00:44:16,328
In your situation, anyone would strongly deny the relationship.

1336
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:17,599
- Instead, you're casual. - The rumor about their romance?

1337
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:20,438
It's neither in March nor May. We have no plans to marry.

1338
00:44:20,439 --> 00:44:21,439
Are you guys in contact?

1339
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,068
No, I hear about him through Jin Woong.

1340
00:44:23,069 --> 00:44:24,508
You contact him too.

1341
00:44:24,509 --> 00:44:27,478
I don't send personal messages.

1342
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:29,149
- It's not true at all. - No.

1343
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:30,679
When someone calls you...

1344
00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:32,379
the KARINA among announcers...

1345
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,419
(He starts to make fun of her.)

1346
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,589
She would refuse vehemently.

1347
00:44:35,149 --> 00:44:36,289
Instead, she just nodded.

1348
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:37,919
- It's a little... - You enjoy it.

1349
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,288
Goodness.

1350
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:41,259
Things are going well for them.

1351
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:43,088
I'm very grateful.

1352
00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:44,529
When people say that you look like KARINA...

1353
00:44:44,629 --> 00:44:46,158
I'm grateful for the generous compliment.

1354
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:47,159
(Being provocative)

1355
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,329
You don't seem convinced.

1356
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:50,668
(She catches on how he really feels.)

1357
00:44:50,669 --> 00:44:54,538
Aren't we at the announcers' room for a reason today?

1358
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:56,069
You will be given a mission.

1359
00:44:56,209 --> 00:44:58,478
I heard that you have someone in mind...

1360
00:44:58,479 --> 00:45:00,338
- to do the mission with. - Yes.

1361
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:03,178
- These two will be the best. - For the competition?

1362
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:05,518
Both of them graduated from Seoul National University.

1363
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,088
- Really? - You went there?

1364
00:45:08,089 --> 00:45:10,588
- You can't defeat them. - In which class and what major?

1365
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:11,988
- I studied vocal music. - Vocal music?

1366
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:13,118
- Yes. - Vocal music?

1367
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,288
You studied vocal music?

1368
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:15,688
What were you? A tenor?

1369
00:45:15,689 --> 00:45:16,789
Yes, I was a tenor.

1370
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:18,228
What was your major?

1371
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:20,869
My major was applied biological chemistry.

1372
00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:23,329
- She was in the sciences. - The sciences?

1373
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,099
- That means... - What's 9 times 8?

1374
00:45:25,799 --> 00:45:27,269
- It's 72. - She's good.

1375
00:45:27,399 --> 00:45:29,839
- I thought he meant your class. - Me too.

1376
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:31,508
I practice these days.

1377
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:32,709
- What's 3 times 7? - It's 21.

1378
00:45:33,409 --> 00:45:35,309
I practice these days because I'm terrible at it.

1379
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:37,278
Please go outside for the mission.

1380
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:38,318
- Outside? - Outside? Why?

1381
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,378
- Are we going outside? - Outside?

1382
00:45:39,379 --> 00:45:40,418
Let's go.

1383
00:45:40,419 --> 00:45:41,518
Good luck, guys.

1384
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:43,049
- We can do it. - Aren't you coming with us?

1385
00:45:43,419 --> 00:45:45,288
- This is great. - The weather is beautiful.

1386
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:47,488
- This is nice. - Don't you feel lighthearted?

1387
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:48,528
In the city...

1388
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:50,028
while walking on asphalt...

1389
00:45:50,029 --> 00:45:51,029
(The mission will take place in an open space.)

1390
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,358
- This looks a little unstable. - Seriously...

1391
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,098
- I know. - Goodness.

1392
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:56,569
I didn't expect to do it outside.

1393
00:45:56,699 --> 00:45:58,399
It's totally spring.

1394
00:45:58,469 --> 00:45:59,939
There's a karaoke machine.

1395
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:01,408
We're in trouble.

1396
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:03,008
There's even a tambourine.

1397
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:04,179
What is this?

1398
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:07,949
Your mission with the KBS announcers is...

1399
00:46:08,149 --> 00:46:09,608
Sing in Korean.

1400
00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:11,079
- Sing in Korean? - Yes.

1401
00:46:11,149 --> 00:46:12,618
It'll be 2-on-2.

1402
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:14,618
Pick a song on the list...

1403
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:15,689
and sing it.

1404
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:18,388
When there's a foreign word in the lyrics,

1405
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:20,888
you must translate it into Korean.

1406
00:46:20,889 --> 00:46:22,628
- It's not bad. - If you sing as is...

1407
00:46:22,629 --> 00:46:24,228
or if your translation is wrong,

1408
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:26,458
you'll lose two points per word.

1409
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:27,968
Your final score will be...

1410
00:46:27,969 --> 00:46:30,528
the karaoke score with deductions applied.

1411
00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:32,638
Do we get to sing a song each?

1412
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:33,799
- That's correct. - Okay.

1413
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:36,439
We'll start with the announcer team.

1414
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:38,939
(The announcers received a mission that isn't easy.)

1415
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:41,448
(He feels more nervous than others.)

1416
00:46:41,449 --> 00:46:43,378
Appearing on 2 Days 1 Night has been my dream.

1417
00:46:43,379 --> 00:46:45,378
It's the one and only real variety show...

1418
00:46:45,379 --> 00:46:47,179
in Korea.

1419
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:50,088
- Gosh, I feel nervous. - Me too.

1420
00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:52,389
They want to make people laugh.

1421
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:53,688
(Will they show off their skills?)

1422
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:54,788
I'm nervous.

1423
00:46:54,789 --> 00:46:56,289
Play music.

1424
00:46:56,659 --> 00:46:58,128
("Whiplash" by aespa)

1425
00:46:58,129 --> 00:46:59,228
Let's go.

1426
00:46:59,229 --> 00:47:01,368
("Whiplash" sung by Kim Jin Woong and Jung Eung Hye)

1427
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:02,429
We will win.

1428
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,369
- We'll take it seriously. - Let's go, KARINA.

1429
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,739
(However...)

1430
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:14,209
(Their performance wasn't included in the show.)

1431
00:47:14,549 --> 00:47:18,149
(They struggled with all their might to translate.)

1432
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:23,389
(But they were defeated disastrously when it came to being funny.)

1433
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,688
- Is this even a song? - What is this?

1434
00:47:25,689 --> 00:47:26,789
I am very cold

1435
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:29,188
(Did you feel very pressured?)

1436
00:47:29,189 --> 00:47:30,998
My junior announcer here...

1437
00:47:30,999 --> 00:47:32,428
had performed a dance before,

1438
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:34,899
so I didn't doubt that we would win with her experience.

1439
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:37,898
But unfortunately, while we were singing,

1440
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:40,338
the sun shone unusually brightly...

1441
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:42,239
every time English lyrics came out.

1442
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,138
So we didn't get a clear view,

1443
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:47,678
which is why I think we couldn't do as well as we were supposed to.

1444
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:48,709
(Variety Show Explanatory Statement)

1445
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:52,549
(It was so hard for them to perform as they wanted to.)

1446
00:47:52,749 --> 00:47:54,689
- Neck injury - This is a little embarrassing.

1447
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:56,349
Let's stay away from them.

1448
00:47:57,289 --> 00:47:59,059
(Social distancing)

1449
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:01,558
My heart ached.

1450
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:02,928
(Their performance broke his heart.)

1451
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:04,958
- This is so flashy, it's shiny - Stop the music, please.

1452
00:48:04,959 --> 00:48:08,028
(Squeezing out airtime is over too.)

1453
00:48:08,029 --> 00:48:09,029
Your score is...

1454
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:10,168
(Team Announcer's karaoke score)

1455
00:48:10,169 --> 00:48:12,469
- eighty-six points. - Really? For what we just did?

1456
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,638
- You did a great job. - This can't be.

1457
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:15,808
(Second-hand embarrassment)

1458
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:16,908
This is so embarrassing.

1459
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:18,238
- I'm really embarrassed. - Didn't we do well?

1460
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:20,878
But you know... The two of them...

1461
00:48:20,879 --> 00:48:23,148
- Oh, goodness. - must be confident in themselves.

1462
00:48:23,149 --> 00:48:26,248
If I were them, I would've failed to sing to the end.

1463
00:48:26,249 --> 00:48:27,379
They have high self-esteem.

1464
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:29,988
- What was before "I've been bad?" - "I've been bad?"

1465
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:31,158
"Hot Issue" by 4Minute.

1466
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:33,188
Good! 4Minute. Let's go.

1467
00:48:33,189 --> 00:48:35,288
- This is easy. I know a bit. - Play the music, please.

1468
00:48:35,289 --> 00:48:37,898
- Dance with me, okay? - But it was a long time ago, so...

1469
00:48:37,899 --> 00:48:39,199
("Hot Issue" originally by 4Minute, sung by Joon and DinDin)

1470
00:48:40,799 --> 00:48:41,869
- Stop - Stop

1471
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:43,228
(Impressed)

1472
00:48:43,229 --> 00:48:44,668
(I will show you)

1473
00:48:44,669 --> 00:48:45,799
(I will show you something)

1474
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:47,198
(Ladies!)

1475
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:48,368
(You are ready!)

1476
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:50,539
(Laugh out loud, let's go!)

1477
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:54,408
(4 minute)

1478
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:55,448
(Lady!)

1479
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:56,608
(From head to toe)

1480
00:48:56,609 --> 00:48:58,418
(Very hot issue)

1481
00:48:58,419 --> 00:48:59,518
(Everything about me)

1482
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,519
(Jong Min and Seon Ho came to watch.)

1483
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,588
(Very hot issue)

1484
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:02,589
(Everything)

1485
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:05,189
So this is... Control. No, wait. What is it in Korean?

1486
00:49:05,259 --> 00:49:06,288
(I'm always)

1487
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:07,828
(Very hot issue)

1488
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:09,928
(Very hot issue)

1489
00:49:09,929 --> 00:49:11,598
(One)

1490
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,758
(The shoes I wear)

1491
00:49:13,759 --> 00:49:14,898
(Two)

1492
00:49:14,899 --> 00:49:16,828
(I do it as I want, I keep striking this)

1493
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:17,898
(Position)

1494
00:49:17,899 --> 00:49:19,868
They're good. They're really great at this.

1495
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:20,869
They're good.

1496
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:24,838
(Three! I applied roughly my lips?)

1497
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,738
(- 4Minute - Makeup!)

1498
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:28,608
(Very hot issue)

1499
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:30,408
(My fashion and everything)

1500
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:32,478
(He sings like Chang Ki Ha.)

1501
00:49:32,479 --> 00:49:36,188
(You can't copy me so sloppily like that)

1502
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:38,058
(Try and copy me if you want)

1503
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,058
(Try and copy my fashion)

1504
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:43,689
(Small star, I'm always a small star!)

1505
00:49:43,889 --> 00:49:45,298
(I am the issue)

1506
00:49:45,299 --> 00:49:46,958
(Even the things I see)

1507
00:49:46,959 --> 00:49:48,868
(I am the issue)

1508
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:50,628
(Even the things I hear)

1509
00:49:50,629 --> 00:49:52,468
(So this is how it should be done.)

1510
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:54,768
(Even the things I say)

1511
00:49:54,769 --> 00:49:56,438
(Baby)

1512
00:49:56,439 --> 00:49:58,608
(Let's jump all together, jump)

1513
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:00,538
(From head to toe)

1514
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,308
(Very hot issue)

1515
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:04,148
(Everything about me)

1516
00:50:04,149 --> 00:50:05,478
(Very hot issue)

1517
00:50:05,479 --> 00:50:08,918
(I manage everything)

1518
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:11,358
(I am always very hot)

1519
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,919
(Issue)

1520
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:16,058
- That was great! - We were amazing.

1521
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:17,758
- We tore it up. - We lost.

1522
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:18,929
- We tore it up. - Indeed.

1523
00:50:19,659 --> 00:50:21,469
- You guys got 99 points. - See? We tore it up.

1524
00:50:21,569 --> 00:50:23,028
We've been completely defeated. I admit it.

1525
00:50:23,029 --> 00:50:24,669
"Whiplash" was very difficult.

1526
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:27,099
I'll announce the result of the Sing in Korean.

1527
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,938
Based on the final scores, after deducting penalty points,

1528
00:50:30,939 --> 00:50:33,708
Team Joon and DinDin won by a large margin.

1529
00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:34,709
That's obvious.

1530
00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:37,078
- What do we do? - I wonder how they performed.

1531
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,219
Can you sing "The Phantom of the Opera" into the mic?

1532
00:50:41,549 --> 00:50:43,848
(Announcer Kim Jin Woong majored in vocal music as a tenor at SNU.)

1533
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:46,718
(He's singing a number from "The Phantom of the Opera...")

1534
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,859
(to get as much airtime as he can.)

1535
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:53,899
Thank you.

1536
00:50:54,569 --> 00:50:56,529
- I'm impressed. - He has such a good voice.

1537
00:50:57,229 --> 00:50:59,738
Let's thank the announcers for sparing their time for us...

1538
00:50:59,739 --> 00:51:01,809
and move to another location to check the final mission results.

1539
00:51:02,009 --> 00:51:04,038
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1540
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:06,109
- Both of you, good luck! - Good luck to you too!

1541
00:51:06,779 --> 00:51:10,178
(It's 3pm, and they're back at the KBS main building.)

1542
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:11,319
Time passes by so quickly today.

1543
00:51:12,049 --> 00:51:15,589
It'll take Se Yoon and Sae Ho more time to finish their mission.

1544
00:51:16,089 --> 00:51:19,058
So you guys should continue squeezing out airtime.

1545
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:20,218
(He doesn't know what to do.)

1546
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:22,088
- Is that right? - Since it's brought up,

1547
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:23,589
can we go to the radio station over there?

1548
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:25,628
- Let's go. - Right. Let's go and watch.

1549
00:51:25,629 --> 00:51:27,628
Let's go and watch the radio studio. Is it this way?

1550
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:29,098
- I see the radio studio over there. - Let's go that way.

1551
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:31,068
Haha's show is from 2pm to 4pm. Haha must be there right now.

1552
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:33,439
- Haha must be hosting his show now. - But he can't be on our show.

1553
00:51:33,739 --> 00:51:34,839
He probably can't because he's a cast member of "Running Man."

1554
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:37,069
I don't care. Let's just do it.

1555
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:38,439
We can film him, without worrying about that.

1556
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,409
Right. Joon, you go on "Running Man" sometime too.

1557
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,008
Hold on. Maybe not.

1558
00:51:43,009 --> 00:51:45,248
Wait, no. Does "Mr. Radio" air from 2pm to 4pm?

1559
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:46,279
I think it airs from 4pm to 6pm.

1560
00:51:46,479 --> 00:51:47,479
"Mr. Radio?"

1561
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:49,989
- Hello. Hey, that's Chang Hee. - Oh, Reddy is in there.

1562
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:52,619
That's Haha, just as we expected.

1563
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:56,629
("Haha's Super Radio" is being broadcast live!)

1564
00:51:57,259 --> 00:51:58,299
Haha!

1565
00:52:00,429 --> 00:52:01,598
Since I was suffering because of the dental treatment...

1566
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,228
(Hi.)

1567
00:52:03,229 --> 00:52:04,999
What? Hold on a second. Who are those out there?

1568
00:52:05,169 --> 00:52:06,369
We're 2 Days 1 Night.

1569
00:52:07,069 --> 00:52:08,208
Oh, 2 Days 1 Night?

1570
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:09,369
- I'm the cast of "Running Man." - 2 Days!

1571
00:52:09,769 --> 00:52:11,678
(We don't care.)

1572
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:13,209
I'm the cast of "Running Man." What are you doing?

1573
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:15,809
- Come and film him. - Make some noise!

1574
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:17,548
- The members of 2 Days 1 Night. - Film inside the booth.

1575
00:52:17,549 --> 00:52:18,919
Film Haha.

1576
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,918
Let's film Haha and let it air.

1577
00:52:21,919 --> 00:52:23,049
Hey, DinDin.

1578
00:52:23,649 --> 00:52:24,688
Get lost.

1579
00:52:24,689 --> 00:52:25,858
(I want you to leave!)

1580
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:27,958
I was joking. I'm sorry.

1581
00:52:27,959 --> 00:52:30,189
Guys, we should keep manners as fellow entertainers.

1582
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:32,228
- Let's keep manners. - We should respect "Running Man."

1583
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:34,399
(While the airtime generators are drifting around the KBS building...)

1584
00:52:34,769 --> 00:52:35,928
(Se Yoon and Sae Ho are still in the Research Building.)

1585
00:52:35,929 --> 00:52:38,238
"Gag Concert" versus 2 Days 1 Night.

1586
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:40,968
The 2nd round of the 2025 Tazzang contest.

1587
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:42,638
(He should make Hyun Young laugh to succeed.)

1588
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:43,868
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1589
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,678
(If he fails to make her laugh, he fails to complete the mission.)

1590
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:46,879
It's 2 Days 1 Night's turn to attack.

1591
00:52:47,009 --> 00:52:48,648
It begins now.

1592
00:52:48,649 --> 00:52:50,909
(Could Se Yoon make her laugh?)

1593
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,229
It begins now.

1594
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:55,139
(Could Se Yoon make her laugh?)

1595
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,869
Hello, everyone. Welcome to "Moon Dong Nam Show."

1596
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,570
Let's meet Moon Dong Nam!

1597
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,680
(He makes weird noises, hisses, and flicks his tongue.)

1598
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,079
(They burst out laughing.)

1599
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,180
(All the others burst into laughter.)

1600
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,620
(But her mouth is closed.)

1601
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,790
(She's not an easy target.)

1602
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,690
(He advances to Stage 2 of his laughter-triggering skill.)

1603
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,230
(Blowing)

1604
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,160
(His secret weapon, blowing with the nose!)

1605
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,559
(She succeeded in holding back her laughter again.)

1606
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,770
All right! Next!

1607
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,029
"Moon Dong Nam Show" will continue. That's great.

1608
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:28,200
(Moon Dong Nam is not enough. He needs something funnier.)

1609
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,269
- Five. - Wait.

1610
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,270
(Remaining time: 5 seconds)

1611
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,910
Please give me just a little more time.

1612
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,010
- Give me a little more time. - Keep going.

1613
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,280
(We feel sorry for our senior comedian.)

1614
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,749
(Relaxed)

1615
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,920
- Show her the square. Square! - I have more to show you.

1616
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:46,590
- I've seen this before. - Five, four...

1617
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,090
(You've seen this?)

1618
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:50,690
- Diamond. - Three.

1619
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:52,890
Two.

1620
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,030
Bow.

1621
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:55,229
(Icy)

1622
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,260
One! Time's up!

1623
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,199
- She didn't laugh. - Time's up.

1624
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,670
(Se Yoon failed.)

1625
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,639
Would you have laughed if he imitated Ju Hyun?

1626
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,680
- She would've laughed. - He should've done that.

1627
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,140
- He should've imitated Ju Hyun. - Ju Hyun.

1628
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:11,979
(Mr. Ju Hyun's soul comes into his body.)

1629
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,949
(He's already funny.)

1630
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,020
Well...

1631
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,519
(Just a single word makes everyone burst into laughter.)

1632
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,890
- You should've done this. - Right.

1633
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,950
She laughed immediately.

1634
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,789
So you must be Hyun Young.

1635
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:22,790
(Mr. Ju Hyun's soul is in his body.)

1636
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,730
I am Ju Hyun.

1637
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,530
You should've done this.

1638
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:29,029
Here goes a square.

1639
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:31,270
(Ju Hyun's version of square)

1640
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,169
(Clapping like a seal)

1641
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,799
She would've definitely laughed if you did this.

1642
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,999
Gosh. This is frustrating.

1643
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,039
(Disappointed)

1644
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,239
- My stomach hurts. - To win in the Tazzang contest,

1645
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,239
you need to spend a whole week coming up with ideas.

1646
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,809
- I can see that. - It's harder than it seems.

1647
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,580
- It takes effort to think of ideas. - Right.

1648
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,519
- Indeed. - It's embarrassing,

1649
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,549
but we should try.

1650
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:49,550
(Se Yoon and Sae Ho failed another mission.)

1651
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:50,749
Hurry up!

1652
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,049
- What are they doing? - You guys drive me crazy.

1653
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,119
What are they doing, seriously?

1654
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,560
We're so full of energy. Why would you leave us alone?

1655
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,259
- By the way, what's with his eyes? - What happened to his eyes?

1656
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,329
Is he wearing sunglasses?

1657
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,659
- What's with his eyes? - Is he wearing sunglasses or what?

1658
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,660
I think he got beaten up.

1659
00:55:02,661 --> 00:55:04,469
- He thinks these are sunglasses. - Is he wearing sunglasses?

1660
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,469
- We waited an hour for you guys. - Why won't anyone take this for me?

1661
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,839
- Are you wearing a mask? - Hey.

1662
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,840
Return this.

1663
00:55:08,841 --> 00:55:10,499
- We waited an hour for you. Yes. - Really?

1664
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,909
We competed against the "Gag Concert" team.

1665
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,270
- We competed against them. - Against the "Gag Concert" team?

1666
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,780
Can't you see how hard we fought?

1667
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:17,210
Did you win?

1668
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,980
- Let's hear the results first. - Good job, everyone.

1669
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:23,249
If you completed 4 out of the 6 missions,

1670
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,850
you can have lunch.

1671
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,420
- Here are the results. - Okay.

1672
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,520
Team Se Yoon and Sae Ho...

1673
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,560
- How did they do? - He started with us.

1674
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,359
- failed both of the two missions. - I'm sorry.

1675
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,790
(They failed both of the 2 missions.)

1676
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:34,929
But...

1677
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,900
(What did they do?)

1678
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,069
But...

1679
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,429
(The square of apology)

1680
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:41,369
They took longer than us.

1681
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,040
(The bow of apology)

1682
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,509
They came an hour later than us, but they failed all missions?

1683
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,169
What did you do with the "Gag Concert" team?

1684
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,209
You lost with all that?

1685
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,309
- You lost? - You're a legend.

1686
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,880
I won, but Se Yoon lost.

1687
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,350
(He makes a bow again to apologize!)

1688
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,020
- But this is funny. Why? - Why did he lose?

1689
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:57,750
It turns out it's not considered funny these days.

1690
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,390
Next up are Joon and DinDin.

1691
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,559
- Suddenly, it's not funny at all. - We're done for.

1692
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,790
They completed both missions.

1693
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,290
Great job.

1694
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:07,460
- Of course, we completed both. - Great job, guys!

1695
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,359
Go away. We'll eat without you two.

1696
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,699
You two can't eat anything.

1697
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,899
We're airtime generators.

1698
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,929
We created a lot of good scenes.

1699
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:13,930
- We created... - Is that so?

1700
00:56:13,931 --> 00:56:15,440
- a lot of good scenes instead. - You guys can relax now.

1701
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,940
Lastly, Jong Min and Seon Ho.

1702
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,480
(They can have lunch if they've won 2 more missions.)

1703
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,939
(What is...)

1704
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,079
(the result?)

1705
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,480
Jong Min and Seon Ho. You both succeeded.

1706
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:31,389
- We won both of them. - Of course.

1707
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:32,589
- Of course, we got them. - I know.

1708
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:33,650
Of course, you had to get it.

1709
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,990
(1 hour ago)

1710
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,700
(Gulping)

1711
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:42,959
Gosh, we got it.

1712
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,669
(It is coffee.)

1713
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:45,670
Sir.

1714
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:48,440
(They won in Sand Lance Coffee Game thanks to the director.)

1715
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,499
You won four missions in total.

1716
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,070
- Really? - You can have lunch.

1717
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,169
- I'm glad. - We did well.

1718
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:55,539
You did a good job. What did we do?

1719
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,540
We can eat a lot for ourselves.

1720
00:56:56,541 --> 00:56:57,779
- Right. - So now,

1721
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,449
let's get moving to have lunch.

1722
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,809
- Let's go. - What's the menu?

1723
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:01,819
There are many good restaurants.

1724
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,750
- I'm starving. - It's Drifting Around KBS.

1725
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:05,949
You have to go to a restaurant within this building.

1726
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,220
- Within the KBS building? - Sounds great.

1727
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,260
The lunch menu for you today is Chinese.

1728
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,559
- Whatever you want. - Will we get it delivered?

1729
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,230
- Tangsuyuk. - Any dish is good.

1730
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,759
- We're leaving now? - Yes, let's get going now.

1731
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,859
- Let's go. - Let's get going.

1732
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,799
(Let's go have lunch at KBS.)

1733
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,969
Get in, everyone.

1734
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,270
- Is it going up? - What, 2 Days 1 Night?

1735
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,109
What does the number 91 mean?

1736
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:28,110
(Where are they going?)

1737
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,179
- Because you work so hard... - Isn't this place...

1738
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,810
- Isn't this place where you... - That's...

1739
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,550
The Division Head works here.

1740
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,720
(The Division Head?)

1741
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,219
(Are we eating here?)

1742
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,989
The Division Head wanted to encourage you all.

1743
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,629
- We are eating here? - He wants to treat you to a meal.

1744
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,689
- Really? - What?

1745
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:48,230
(For real?)

1746
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:51,569
(Their faces quickly turn stiff.)

1747
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,569
- No, tell him to go home. - Let's go.

1748
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,639
- Are we eating together? - Yes.

1749
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,399
- Tell him he can't encourage us. - Are we eating with him?

1750
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,709
- Yes, with him. - I see.

1751
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,539
- Really? - Tell him he can't encourage us.

1752
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,609
It's right here.

1753
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,710
(Never seen them discouraged during a meal time)

1754
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,109
(Hesitantly walking inside)

1755
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,479
- Do we have to greet him? - He's right there.

1756
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,850
It's here. Do we have to go in?

1757
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,779
Yes, go inside the room.

1758
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,689
- Is the meal ready? - The meal's ready?

1759
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,620
(Squeaking)

1760
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,219
- Hello. - Oh, my. Hello.

1761
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,330
- It has been a long time. - Hello.

1762
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,300
I'm sorry, it took me a while to say hello to you all.

1763
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,759
(Han Kyung Cheon, Head of Variety Show Division)

1764
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,059
(A former Chief Producer of 2 Days 1 Night)

1765
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,999
- How have you been? - What happened to your eyes?

1766
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,840
I had to do a mission.

1767
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,969
- I wanted to look nice, but... - Hello.

1768
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:31,570
We didn't have time to erase our makeup.

1769
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,869
- You two don't look... - Right.

1770
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:35,180
- We were just doing our work... - Right.

1771
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,639
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

1772
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,010
(Polite attitude in contrast with their makeup)

1773
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,349
- Here. - May we take our seats?

1774
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,650
- Please sit. - You're treating us to a meal.

1775
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,320
- I can't believe we're here. - My gosh.

1776
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,719
Are we having jjajangmyeon here?

1777
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,890
- Yes. - Really?

1778
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,789
Are we eating with him?

1779
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,460
- Are we eating here? - We are eating here?

1780
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,719
- Are you all uncomfortable? - No, we're fine.

1781
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,159
- No, we're fine. - We're eating when he's not?

1782
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,160
That's not...

1783
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:55,359
Are we eating here?

1784
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,630
- Director. - Yes?

1785
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,399
- Are we having jjajangmyeon here? - That's right.

1786
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,269
- With Mr. Han? - That's amazing.

1787
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,870
- I'm honored. It's so nice. - Goodness.

1788
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,609
- I'm honored. It's so nice. - When would we ever eat here?

1789
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,670
When would I ever eat with the celebrities?

1790
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,279
It might smell a lot here.

1791
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,979
Gosh, no worries. Work comes first.

1792
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,649
We actually eat here a lot while having meetings.

1793
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,750
It's for the show. It's fine.

1794
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,849
Anyway,

1795
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:18,219
you can tell us...

1796
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,019
what we can do to improve...

1797
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,459
the show quality until jjajangmyeon comes.

1798
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,689
You can tell us what we're doing fine.

1799
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:25,890
It would be great if you could tell us shortly.

1800
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:27,760
It would be nice if he could tell us that.

1801
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,060
These days, people like it...

1802
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:30,899
when you point it out.

1803
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,629
I heard that Gen MZ hates it.

1804
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,469
- No, we're not Gen MZ. - None of us is Gen MZ.

1805
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,799
- He's the only Gen MZ here. - The only Gen MZ here.

1806
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,869
I'm Gen MZ too.

1807
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,109
- I'm Gen MZ too. - Me too.

1808
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,809
- He's not Gen MZ. - You're just a blooper.

1809
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:40,810
(Laughing)

1810
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:41,940
He liked it.

1811
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,409
- He likes jokes like that. - An old-style joke.

1812
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:45,450
They used to say the best one of us is the Head of Garage.

1813
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,950
(Laughing)

1814
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,990
(Gosh, that was hilarious.)

1815
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,660
(Mr. Han, that was a good one.)

1816
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:56,319
(Overreacting)

1817
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,429
- You're flattering him. - You have to react like that.

1818
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,429
We have to react like that.

1819
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,329
Not the Variety Show Center, but the Garage Center.

1820
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,800
(Automated reaction)

1821
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:08,439
(Laughing hard)

1822
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,869
(Forced laugh with a rectangular-shaped mouth)

1823
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,539
- He's indeed... - We have to learn from him.

1824
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,569
- I know. - You can't...

1825
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,380
(So this is how you should react.)

1826
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,879
What was your first show, Mr. Han?

1827
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,049
- When I first started working? - Yes.

1828
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:21,579
- That's really old. - But still...

1829
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,749
- About 30 years ago. - Right.

1830
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:25,589
I started with a comedy show.

1831
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:26,919
- Right. - Which one?

1832
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,020
"Humor No. 1."

1833
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,919
There was a show called "Humor No.1."

1834
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,629
- You see Director Kang here. - Right.

1835
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,960
- Where is he? - Chan Hee.

1836
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,869
During the 1st season of 2 Days 1 Night,

1837
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:40,069
I worked with him as the Chief Producer.

1838
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,699
I used to shoot the show with him.

1839
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,769
I see.

1840
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:45,009
I have worked with him for about 25 to 30 years.

1841
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,739
When I was the Chief Producer of 2 Days 1 Night,

1842
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:50,910
I used to eat and drink with the cast too.

1843
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:56,350
(His past stories are getting long.)

1844
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:57,949
With just one camera...

1845
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,219
You use many cameras these days.

1846
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,820
Of course, we had several cameras.

1847
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:02,319
(With one single camera, )

1848
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,460
(we had to shoot many things.)

1849
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,030
(This is why I like this show.)

1850
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,929
(Jong Min plays a big role here.)

1851
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,329
(They stopped reacting.)

1852
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:12,470
You know shows like "Saturday Night Live Korea?"

1853
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:13,869
Speaking of my son, he's actually calling me.

1854
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,069
His son is calling.

1855
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:16,439
- The prince is calling him. - No.

1856
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,469
I mean he's sharing meaningful...

1857
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:20,509
- I think... - It's like "Zootopia."

1858
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,609
someone should come here...

1859
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:23,510
every now and then and be his friend.

1860
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,709
- He must have been bored. - He needs a friend to talk with.

1861
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:28,379
I can see that he needs a friend.

1862
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,549
- You should come and talk with him. - So I arranged a lot of meetings.

1863
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:32,550
(Arranged meetings instead of having friends)

1864
01:01:32,551 --> 01:01:34,419
So your new segments...

1865
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,560
I saw a bunch of them. They're all nice.

1866
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,529
Which one did you like?

1867
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,159
Gosh, I think our food is here.

1868
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,330
(Luckily, their lunch is here.)

1869
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:43,729
Let's eat together.

1870
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:44,969
We have to spread this.

1871
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:46,829
- It's jjamppong soup for Mr. Han. - Jjamppong soup.

1872
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:47,830
(Flattering)

1873
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:51,710
I can't believe we're eating with you.

1874
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,179
(I can't believe I'm eating with him.)

1875
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,439
You got a double portion?

1876
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,509
Yes, mine is a double portion.

1877
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:58,609
This is crazy.

1878
01:01:58,610 --> 01:01:59,610
(They're ready to eat.)

1879
01:01:59,611 --> 01:02:01,620
(Glancing)

1880
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,819
- Let's eat. I'll put it here. - Okay.

1881
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:05,820
(Mr. Han has not taken a bite yet.)

1882
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,989
This could be our last meal.

1883
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,519
We should eat a lot since it could be our last meal.

1884
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,530
(As soon as Mr. Han takes a bite, )

1885
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,729
(they start eating jjajangmyeon.)

1886
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:16,800
It's good.

1887
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,530
There are many good restaurants around KBS.

1888
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,299
(Taking a bite)

1889
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:26,270
(Having a late lunch at 4pm)

1890
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,439
Goodness, it's nice.

1891
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,780
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

1892
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,080
(Slurping)

1893
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,349
(Sae Ho is about to take a bite.)

1894
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:34,179
Yeong Seok has been a good friend...

1895
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,420
- of mine for a long time. - Right, he is...

1896
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,119
I have been friends with him for a very long time.

1897
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,290
(His work talk Part 2 starts.)

1898
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:42,119
I always wished we could work together.

1899
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,390
(He's waiting to take a bite.)

1900
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:46,390
I get overwhelmed whenever I see them.

1901
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,700
- They're amazing. - They are the ones...

1902
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,729
They are the ones who know the reality of KBS.

1903
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:54,029
(Fire Alarm Announcement)

1904
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:55,699
- It's an announcement. - Right.

1905
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,840
(The announcement cut him off at the right time.)

1906
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,439
(Mr. Han finally stopped talking.)

1907
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,440
"Music Bank."

1908
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:04,480
There was a fire while they were pre-recording the show.

1909
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,710
Really?

1910
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,219
There was a spark.

1911
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,880
That material usually wouldn't catch fire.

1912
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,349
(Nonstop talking)

1913
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:15,420
(One of the staff put off the fire.)

1914
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,489
(Eating and listening)

1915
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:20,529
That's what happened.

1916
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,000
(Director Joo Jong Hyun...)

1917
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:26,029
(Zoning out)

1918
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:28,600
It's nice to shoot a variety show on the public TV.

1919
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,439
I'm serious. People should come here...

1920
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,210
every hour to be his friend.

1921
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,609
He loves talking so much.

1922
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,709
- Right, so I have many meetings. - Later...

1923
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:38,710
You should compete against him.

1924
01:03:38,711 --> 01:03:40,509
- His talk is fun. - Today...

1925
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:43,280
- You know how I'm good at talking. - Right.

1926
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,390
I'm learning a lot from him.

1927
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,690
His talks have an essence.

1928
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,329
- We'll continue with the shoot. - Thank you.

1929
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:52,989
- Thank you for your stories. - Thank you.

1930
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:54,090
We'll get going now.

1931
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,399
- Take seats on each side. - Do we sit here?

1932
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,930
- Where? What are we doing? - By three.

1933
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:59,969
- Did you enjoy your meal? - Yes.

1934
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,469
- I enjoyed it. I ate too much. - I loved it.

1935
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,499
- I ate too much. - So...

1936
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,970
We have to increase the airtime.

1937
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,470
From now on,

1938
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:09,840
- please call your friends. - Really?

1939
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:11,550
What kind of friends?

1940
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:13,249
- You want us to call our friends? - What are we doing?

1941
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,449
Do we just call anyone?

1942
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:17,249
Since we're shooting Yeouido, Seoul after a long time,

1943
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,150
you should call your friends.

1944
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:21,689
What about when we sleep? They can't sleep with us.

1945
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:22,819
We have to ask about their schedule.

1946
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,560
Only Sleepy would come if we have to sleep here.

1947
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,789
(Is there any problem?)

1948
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,489
- Why does he always want to come? - He's babysitting.

1949
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:29,859
I have a lot of married friends who would want to be here.

1950
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:30,860
They'd be excited.

1951
01:04:30,861 --> 01:04:32,329
You'll spend dinner hours with them.

1952
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:34,230
- Dinner hours. - All right.

1953
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,199
What happens...

1954
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,369
if my friends don't come?

1955
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:38,939
- What happens if they don't come? - What if they don't come?

1956
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,969
- Who can we invite suddenly? - I know.

1957
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,009
I can think of a few.

1958
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:43,080
Would Dong Wook come?

1959
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:46,249
- Dong Wook loves this show. - Really?

1960
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,450
But he's shooting a drama. It's nearing its end.

1961
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,919
Try calling him. He might be off today.

1962
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:51,920
(We'll be waiting for you to be on the show.)

1963
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,249
Let's all get started.

1964
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,660
- Let's show off your connections. - I don't have friends.

1965
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,019
(At that moment)

1966
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,359
Can I invite my elementary school friends?

1967
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,459
Hello.

1968
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,589
(Se Yoon is receiving a call from a mysterious person.)

1969
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:02,660
- Hello. - Are you busy?

1970
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:03,860
What? Who is it?

1971
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:06,399
Hey, you just called at the right time.

1972
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,769
- Where are you? - What's your schedule like?

1973
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,569
- I'm shooting a show. - Me too.

1974
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,600
- You too? - Gosh.

1975
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:12,709
- That's amazing. - That's amazing.

1976
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:14,010
(Perfect teamwork)

1977
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:15,339
- That's amazing. - That's amazing.

1978
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,440
(Laughing)

1979
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,880
That's like a comedy show.

1980
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,679
Let's all get going.

1981
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,049
I should call someone that would shock people.

1982
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,480
- Okay. - Let's go.

1983
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,519
I didn't know there was a place like this.

1984
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,850
(Refreshing)

1985
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,789
Rain...

1986
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,090
(He's posing as he's pretending to be thinking.)

1987
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,759
(He looks uselessly cool here.)

1988
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,930
Son Suk Ku.

1989
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:36,700
ZICO.

1990
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,200
Let me see.

1991
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,700
He has to be famous.

1992
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,670
He needs to have good chemistry with me.

1993
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:47,669
It has to be someone who would have time alone...

1994
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:49,209
on Fridays like today.

1995
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,710
He also should be free tomorrow.

1996
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:53,109
It can't be someone too popular.

1997
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:54,110
(It can't be someone too popular.)

1998
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,319
I'm sure he'll come.

1999
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,680
(Convinced)

2000
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:58,290
Why would you call me right after him?

2001
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,690
What do you mean?

2002
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,620
- You... - Nucksal just called me.

2003
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,159
I'm sure he had no other business.

2004
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,160
(Se Yoon's Saturday family, HANHAE)
- Where are you? - I mean...

2005
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:06,630
I'm on my way home after my workout.

2006
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:09,129
So you're quite free tonight.

2007
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,559
I'll give you a chance to be a star.

2008
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,030
Come to the KBS Hall right now.

2009
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:13,799
- What? - Cut it out.

2010
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,070
Are you coming or not? Hurry.

2011
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,240
I'm at the KBS Hall.

2012
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,069
I get what you're leading to. Se Yoon!

2013
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:21,780
Are you going to become a star or what?

2014
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,179
I should definitely become a star.

2015
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,309
Hurry up and come then.

2016
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:26,409
It will take you 15 minutes if you follow the speed limit.

2017
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,779
- I'm hanging up. - Fifteen minutes?

2018
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:28,819
(Hanging up)

2019
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:31,320
Let's go. He will come in 15 minutes.

2020
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:32,920
You see this, right?

2021
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,590
This is my fan room.

2022
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,589
This is the background picture?

2023
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:38,120
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

2024
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:42,000
I will call a star.

2025
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:46,000
He's a younger friend.

2026
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:48,130
He's hot right now.

2027
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,640
It would be harder not to know this guy.

2028
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,510
- Hey. - Hey.

2029
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,080
- Hi. - What are you up to?

2030
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,609
I was going to the gym after getting done with work.

2031
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:01,779
You're going to the gym?

2032
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:04,080
I'm filming 2 Days 1 Night right now.

2033
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:06,089
I can't call just anyone when I'm asked to call a friend.

2034
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:07,949
I can't call Sleepy, can I?

2035
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:10,860
Gosh, what are you saying?

2036
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,730
Must I get there by a certain time?

2037
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,059
We can adjust to your schedule.

2038
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,559
I'm expecting it to be around dinner time.

2039
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,170
I was asked to invite you for dinner.

2040
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,400
So you're able to come, right?

2041
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,969
I was heading to the gym...

2042
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:27,569
- after getting off work. - Really?

2043
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,240
You'll be working out here anyway.

2044
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:31,979
- Really? - You'll work out your intestines.

2045
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,209
You'll work out your mind and body.

2046
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:34,579
You'll do all sorts of things here.

2047
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,980
- I have a question for you. - Right.

2048
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,650
Will you also be free tomorrow?

2049
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:40,690
- Tomorrow? - Yes.

2050
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,119
I should sleep at home.

2051
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,219
Okay.

2052
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,489
- Okay. I'll see you later. - Okay.

2053
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:48,399
- See you. - Bye.

2054
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,530
(He just finds him to be cute.)

2055
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,900
Doesn't he sound so humble compared to how well he's doing?

2056
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:54,229
So he'll be coming.

2057
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:55,900
(Who is the star that DinDin has invited?)

2058
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,540
(The other members are doing their best to invite their friends.)

2059
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,869
(Where is Sae Ho?)

2060
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:03,610
I'm naturally heading toward that place.

2061
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,650
I have to invite a friend.

2062
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,719
It's the most reliable person.

2063
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:10,780
(He came outside to invite someone?)

2064
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:14,690
He's in the middle of the show.

2065
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,490
(Where is this place that Sae Ho has come to?)

2066
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,790
(The radio booth of "Mr. Radio" that Chang Hee hosts)

2067
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:21,460
(He's planning to invite Chang Hee in person.)

2068
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:24,330
(Sae Ho gets spotted from inside as well.)

2069
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:27,070
(I'm here, my friend.)

2070
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:28,999
(Signalling for him to come in)

2071
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Can I go in?

2072
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,039
I can go in.

2073
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,010
I'm matching with Chang Hee.

2074
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,409
We're wearing the same jacket.

2075
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:37,940
(Was he destined to be on the show today?)

2076
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,379
Hello.

2077
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:41,580
- Welcome. - Hi. Long time no see.

2078
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:43,819
(You may go inside.)

2079
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:44,880
Can I go in?

2080
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,849
- What's wrong with your eyes? - Hello.

2081
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:47,889
I was in the middle of a shoot.

2082
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,490
Hey. Sit here.

2083
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:51,789
- All right. - Right.

2084
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:53,490
- The song just ended. - Yes.

2085
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:56,559
Chang Hee's best friend visited our live show.

2086
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,929
- Right. - Please reveal your voice.

2087
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,599
I have made a surprise visit.

2088
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,539
- Right. - Can you not look normal?

2089
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:03,999
- Oh, right. - What's going on?

2090
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,609
It's Friday.

2091
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:07,670
I was in the middle of a shoot for 2 Days 1 Night.

2092
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,140
- As I was passing by, - Right.

2093
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,710
I was reminded of my friend.

2094
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:15,120
That was how I made a surprise visit.

2095
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,219
(Mimicking Bobby Kim)

2096
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:21,090
(Singing his heart out)

2097
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,590
(He ended up in a live radio show while trying to invite his friend.)

2098
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:26,660
(Everyone has invited their friend except for Sae Ho.)

2099
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:28,599
- My friend is coming. - What do we do?

2100
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,029
Can't we sit anywhere for now?

2101
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:32,629
My friend decided to come back while getting off work.

2102
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,069
My friend won't be here yet.

2103
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:35,270
Did you all succeed?

2104
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:36,370
I got it done in one go.

2105
01:09:36,371 --> 01:09:37,400
(Be excited for my friend.)

2106
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,739
Why is Sae Ho missing...

2107
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,070
for so long?

2108
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,409
He's using a different method. He went to look for his friend.

2109
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:44,410
- A different method? - A different method?

2110
01:09:44,411 --> 01:09:46,410
It must be someone who is in the KBS building then.

2111
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,550
(I got an idea.)

2112
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,790
- He's coming! - Really?

2113
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,820
What? It's always him.

2114
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:55,590
Why are you here?

2115
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:59,060
(Guessed correctly)

2116
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,489
- May we join in? - Why isn't anyone clapping?

2117
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,030
- Why did you call me? - What?

2118
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:04,699
- Why did you call earlier? - I called thinking you were...

2119
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,829
going to be here.

2120
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:06,870
(Greeting the friend without any clapping)

2121
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,469
- But can it be this quiet... - Hold on.

2122
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:09,970
When a celebrity just came in?

2123
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,569
- I'm getting goosebumps. - Hold on.

2124
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:12,769
It's because they're all too excited.

2125
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,309
- What's all this about, Sae Ho? - Hold on.

2126
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,840
- Did you invite me to mistreat me? - No. Move inside.

2127
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:18,009
- But why... - I had no idea.

2128
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:19,979
- You always invite him. - I made an effort to invite him.

2129
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:21,610
It's my celebrity friend,

2130
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,380
Nam Chang Hee!

2131
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,679
Hello.

2132
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,320
(Sae Ho's friend, Nam Chang Hee)

2133
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:29,460
(Don't mistreat me. I'm part of the family.)

2134
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,189
I'm Nam Chang Hee

2135
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,660
(He quietly filled in when Sae Ho wasn't here.)

2136
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:38,830
(Chang Hee got an IV drip after filming for 2 Days 1 Night.)

2137
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,000
(How nice would it be if you could adore Chang Hee?)

2138
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,599
Chang Hee is here.

2139
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,909
I'm predicting Se Yoon to have invited HANHAE.

2140
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,169
- No. - HANHAE!

2141
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:49,479
You two will battle it out with your faces.

2142
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,780
- Is that so? - Yes.

2143
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:53,580
(These two are known to look like each other.)

2144
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,379
When Chang Hee and my friend meet,

2145
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,620
one must die.

2146
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,050
- Hello. - Hello.

2147
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,819
(The second friend that was in question arrives.)

2148
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,320
Hello.

2149
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:07,389
But since we have a celebrity friend here,

2150
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:09,460
we could catch up with him or ask him questions.

2151
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,400
- It's Nam Chang Hee! - Gosh!

2152
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:13,169
Chang Hee!

2153
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,370
My gosh.

2154
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,200
(Nam Chang Hee arrives.)

2155
01:11:17,201 --> 01:11:18,539
- HANHAE! - HANHAE!

2156
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,770
What's up, HANHAE?

2157
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,079
It's ChoNam Zone!

2158
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,179
- It's ChoNam Zone! - They look alike!

2159
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,310
(Becoming a part of ChoNam Zone?)

2160
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,579
He looks just like him.

2161
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:28,779
(He refuses.)

2162
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:29,820
Gosh.

2163
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:32,219
(He heads straight to his friend.)

2164
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,420
My goodness.

2165
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:38,630
(The rapper with an unpredictable flow)

2166
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:44,460
(He even made himself known with ballad songs with his sweet voice.)

2167
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:48,070
(Being cute is a bonus.)

2168
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,499
Hello. I'm HANHAE.

2169
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,539
Thank you for inviting me to such a big show.

2170
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,839
(Se Yoon's friend, HANHAE)

2171
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,709
- It's HANHAE. - It's HANHAE.

2172
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:57,139
- HANHAE raised DinDin. - Yes?

2173
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:58,749
- Right. - I raised DinDin?

2174
01:11:58,750 --> 01:11:59,849
- It's okay to talk about it. - Right.

2175
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:02,379
I did come up with a catchphrase.

2176
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:04,279
- "DinDin is DinDin." - Right.

2177
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,289
(The one that started "DinDin is DinDin")

2178
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:06,290
- Tell us about it. - HANHAE made that?

2179
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:07,449
- He wrote the song? - I came up with it.

2180
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:09,119
Actually,

2181
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,289
HANHAE first said that to mock me.

2182
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:13,729
- Gosh. - "DinDin is DinDin." He did this.

2183
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:15,160
This was how I responded.

2184
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,860
("DinDin is DinDin?" What does that even mean?)

2185
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,800
(He turned HANHAE's diss into his own song.)

2186
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,339
So you thought that "DinDin" was a curse word of itself.

2187
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,669
- Right. - That's not true.

2188
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:27,539
- That was what it was like. - That was what he meant then.

2189
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:28,779
But it turned out to be the best hit song for you.

2190
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,139
After I made the song,

2191
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:32,049
- I asked him to feature in it. - Right.

2192
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:34,209
He came and recorded, "DinDin is DinDin."

2193
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:35,750
- Right. - "DinDin is DinDin."

2194
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:36,949
"DinDin is DinDin."

2195
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,050
- He only asked me to do this. - Right.

2196
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:39,949
- Really? - I went for the recording,

2197
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:41,119
- and it ended in five minutes. - Right.

2198
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,319
After making that song, I've been singing that song well...

2199
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,989
whenever I get invited to events.

2200
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:46,159
- Gosh. - Things turned out well.

2201
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,630
- He's such a great singer. - Gosh.

2202
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:55,170
(We've been using the song well as the theme song for DinDin the Brat.)

2203
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:56,940
DinDin, your friend is Sleepy, right?

2204
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,069
- Chang Hee. - Yes?

2205
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:59,239
I've brought up the scale this time.

2206
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,110
- You have? It's not Sleepy? - Yes.

2207
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,479
You all will be surprised when my friend comes in.

2208
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,509
- Really? - Really?

2209
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:05,650
- Should we be excited? - Yes.

2210
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:09,550
(Is this DinDin's friend that has just arrived?)

2211
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:13,090
(The staff members gather to get an autograph.)

2212
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:16,659
Here?

2213
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:17,990
(The third friend arrives while getting escorted in.)

2214
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,289
- What? - Something fell.

2215
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:20,629
Hey!

2216
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:21,929
- I see! - Gosh!

2217
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,759
- Hey, Dex! - Gosh!

2218
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:25,899
Hey!

2219
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,270
It's really him?

2220
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:29,470
He was right.

2221
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,310
(Who could it be?)

2222
01:13:33,327 --> 01:13:35,896
- Hey, Dex! - Gosh!

2223
01:13:35,897 --> 01:13:37,156
Dex?

2224
01:13:37,157 --> 01:13:38,280
- Gosh. - What?

2225
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:40,347
- Hey, Jin Young. - He was right.

2226
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:41,816
(Welcome in.)

2227
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,517
- Whose friend is he? DinDin? - You called Dex?

2228
01:13:43,617 --> 01:13:44,777
DinDin called him?

2229
01:13:44,977 --> 01:13:46,287
- Hello. - Hello.

2230
01:13:46,487 --> 01:13:48,817
(Amazed)

2231
01:13:49,357 --> 01:13:50,616
You're close to DinDin?

2232
01:13:50,617 --> 01:13:52,286
- Hello. - You two are close?

2233
01:13:52,287 --> 01:13:53,586
- Hello. - You two are close?

2234
01:13:53,587 --> 01:13:54,986
Why is he close to DinDin?

2235
01:13:54,987 --> 01:13:57,297
- Gosh. - Let's start by greeting them.

2236
01:13:57,427 --> 01:14:00,166
Hello, viewers. My name is Dex.

2237
01:14:00,167 --> 01:14:01,296
(DinDin's friend, Dex)

2238
01:14:01,297 --> 01:14:02,536
It's great to have you here, Dex.

2239
01:14:02,537 --> 01:14:04,837
- Thank you for inviting me. - It's Dex.

2240
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:13,607
(The alpha male and former UDT soldier)

2241
01:14:15,047 --> 01:14:19,617
(He has already taken over variety shows too.)

2242
01:14:20,887 --> 01:14:24,587
(The hottest star, Dex)

2243
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:27,286
I feel flustered...

2244
01:14:27,287 --> 01:14:29,426
- as a really popular star has come. - Right.

2245
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:31,497
He's the hottest right now.

2246
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:33,497
Why are you close to DinDin?

2247
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:35,736
- Are you two very close? - How can a guy this great...

2248
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,666
- You have to be careful. - We are quite...

2249
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:38,806
It would be better for you not to meet him...

2250
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:39,906
if you want to avoid any trouble.

2251
01:14:39,907 --> 01:14:42,407
That is why I only meet him for public occasions.

2252
01:14:42,777 --> 01:14:44,307
- Just in front of a camera. - Just in front of a camera.

2253
01:14:44,337 --> 01:14:46,607
- That's smart of you. - That's a good decision.

2254
01:14:46,877 --> 01:14:50,016
Surprisingly, it's Dex's first time to appear on a KBS show.

2255
01:14:50,017 --> 01:14:51,176
- Really? - Really?

2256
01:14:51,177 --> 01:14:52,416
Let's give him a round of applause.

2257
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:54,047
- That's great. - That's great.

2258
01:14:54,387 --> 01:14:56,316
Now that he's made his appearance, he can...

2259
01:14:56,317 --> 01:14:58,216
- He can settle in now. - Right.

2260
01:14:58,217 --> 01:14:59,387
You've made it to public TV!

2261
01:14:59,557 --> 01:15:02,626
I've been invited to 2 Days 1 Night, a show with a long history.

2262
01:15:02,627 --> 01:15:04,396
- It's my first time on a KBS show. - Gosh.

2263
01:15:04,397 --> 01:15:05,966
- Congratulations. - Now,

2264
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:07,926
everybody will be in trouble. Once he appears on our show,

2265
01:15:07,927 --> 01:15:10,196
everyone, from children to elders, will love him.

2266
01:15:10,197 --> 01:15:11,236
- Right. - They will go wild.

2267
01:15:11,237 --> 01:15:12,866
You're already popular. Will you be okay with that?

2268
01:15:12,867 --> 01:15:14,866
You can always invite me.

2269
01:15:14,867 --> 01:15:16,906
- Really? - Even when you need a replacement.

2270
01:15:16,907 --> 01:15:18,606
- I'm always open. - Really?

2271
01:15:18,607 --> 01:15:20,206
- That wouldn't be right. - Soon,

2272
01:15:20,207 --> 01:15:22,946
Jong Min might be away for a bit.

2273
01:15:22,947 --> 01:15:24,746
- Really? - Jong Min...

2274
01:15:24,747 --> 01:15:25,986
Right.

2275
01:15:25,987 --> 01:15:27,617
- He has to go on his honeymoon. - In April.

2276
01:15:28,187 --> 01:15:29,486
Is Jong Min going to leave the show?

2277
01:15:29,487 --> 01:15:31,016
- Is he leaving the show? - No, he's going on his honeymoon.

2278
01:15:31,017 --> 01:15:32,356
Honeymoon.

2279
01:15:32,357 --> 01:15:34,626
He has to go on his honeymoon.

2280
01:15:34,627 --> 01:15:36,726
I could be here for 2 or 3 episodes.

2281
01:15:36,727 --> 01:15:38,667
I'm not scared of you, but I'm scared of him.

2282
01:15:39,397 --> 01:15:41,526
If Dex comes, he'll replace you.

2283
01:15:41,527 --> 01:15:42,836
I'm not worried about you two.

2284
01:15:42,837 --> 01:15:43,997
- We're worried too. - Really?

2285
01:15:44,137 --> 01:15:45,366
But we will come as well.

2286
01:15:45,367 --> 01:15:47,737
(His existence threatens Jong Min.)

2287
01:15:47,837 --> 01:15:49,806
Look. They're all famous.

2288
01:15:49,807 --> 01:15:51,337
We have Dex here too.

2289
01:15:51,737 --> 01:15:53,647
Is your friend above him?

2290
01:15:53,707 --> 01:15:55,077
This person is in trend.

2291
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:56,847
More than Dex?

2292
01:15:57,247 --> 01:15:59,346
The person is world-famous.

2293
01:15:59,347 --> 01:16:00,986
- The whole world? - World-famous?

2294
01:16:00,987 --> 01:16:02,616
- World-famous. - World-famous?

2295
01:16:02,617 --> 01:16:04,586
- Shouldn't we go to the side? - No.

2296
01:16:04,587 --> 01:16:07,056
We're at the center now.

2297
01:16:07,057 --> 01:16:08,357
So far.

2298
01:16:08,427 --> 01:16:09,896
When the person comes,

2299
01:16:09,897 --> 01:16:11,526
take a look.

2300
01:16:11,527 --> 01:16:12,926
- Automatically? - If you think you can remain here,

2301
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,927
then just sit down.

2302
01:16:13,997 --> 01:16:15,226
If you think you should step aside, go to the side.

2303
01:16:15,227 --> 01:16:17,797
When the person appears, I'll check.

2304
01:16:18,097 --> 01:16:19,166
When the person enters,

2305
01:16:19,167 --> 01:16:21,036
- Check carefully. - I'll move naturally.

2306
01:16:21,037 --> 01:16:23,377
- Like this. - Tap me like this. "DinDin."

2307
01:16:23,707 --> 01:16:25,007
I'll move to the side.

2308
01:16:26,877 --> 01:16:28,976
(It's someone's female friend.)

2309
01:16:28,977 --> 01:16:31,077
(The fourth friend has arrived.)

2310
01:16:31,347 --> 01:16:32,416
- Really? - He has a shoot.

2311
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:33,916
- He has to leave at 6pm. - Someone is here.

2312
01:16:33,917 --> 01:16:35,756
- Is someone here? - What did you apply for?

2313
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:37,357
It's a lady.

2314
01:16:37,417 --> 01:16:38,617
- Hello. - Hello.

2315
01:16:40,487 --> 01:16:42,457
- Hello. - Hello.

2316
01:16:42,627 --> 01:16:44,056
Hello. There are so many people.

2317
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:45,197
- Hello. - It's Kang Han Na.

2318
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:47,626
There's a lady. Let's go to the side.

2319
01:16:47,627 --> 01:16:48,697
(We lost.)

2320
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:51,536
- Goodness. - Go to the side.

2321
01:16:51,537 --> 01:16:52,706
(They soon move away from the center seats.)

2322
01:16:52,707 --> 01:16:54,436
- Whose friend are you? - Hello.

2323
01:16:54,437 --> 01:16:55,506
Hello.

2324
01:16:55,507 --> 01:16:56,806
(Whose friend is she?)

2325
01:16:56,807 --> 01:16:57,906
- Could she sit here? - Whose friend is she?

2326
01:16:57,907 --> 01:16:59,476
- Whose friend is she? - She's my friend.

2327
01:16:59,477 --> 01:17:00,977
- Really? - Joon.

2328
01:17:01,407 --> 01:17:02,446
(Lee Joon's friend, Kang Han Na)

2329
01:17:02,447 --> 01:17:03,477
Hi.

2330
01:17:06,317 --> 01:17:09,657
(A masterpiece was created with her chemistry with Lee Joon.)

2331
01:17:10,517 --> 01:17:15,027
(She acts in various genres from romantic comedy to period dramas.)

2332
01:17:16,897 --> 01:17:20,027
(The standard female lead, Kang Han Na)

2333
01:17:20,627 --> 01:17:23,037
Hello. I'm Kang Han Na, Lee Joon's friend.

2334
01:17:25,467 --> 01:17:26,636
Make some noise.

2335
01:17:26,637 --> 01:17:28,236
(An energetic welcome)

2336
01:17:28,237 --> 01:17:29,706
You came to do this.

2337
01:17:29,707 --> 01:17:31,376
(They're in charge of reacting today.)

2338
01:17:31,377 --> 01:17:32,906
It wouldn't be easy...

2339
01:17:32,907 --> 01:17:35,176
- to be close to Joon in person. - It wouldn't be easy.

2340
01:17:35,177 --> 01:17:37,777
I don't think I'm close to him in person.

2341
01:17:38,077 --> 01:17:40,686
- I'm joking. - We contact each other.

2342
01:17:40,687 --> 01:17:42,317
Are you agemates?

2343
01:17:43,057 --> 01:17:44,387
- No. - How old are you?

2344
01:17:44,587 --> 01:17:45,656
- You are... - What?

2345
01:17:45,657 --> 01:17:46,926
- So... - We don't...

2346
01:17:46,927 --> 01:17:47,986
- Han Na is younger. - He's older?

2347
01:17:47,987 --> 01:17:49,796
I was born in early 1989, and he was born in early 1988.

2348
01:17:49,797 --> 01:17:51,927
- I'm older. - You are older.

2349
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,996
You were both born in the early months? In 1988 and 1989?

2350
01:17:53,997 --> 01:17:56,836
We didn't settle this well at first.

2351
01:17:56,837 --> 01:17:58,066
So how do you talk to each other?

2352
01:17:58,067 --> 01:17:59,266
- We use honorifics. - We use honorifics.

2353
01:17:59,267 --> 01:18:01,066
- Really? You use honorifics? - You both use honorifics?

2354
01:18:01,067 --> 01:18:02,177
Yes.

2355
01:18:02,237 --> 01:18:03,376
Like Lee Jung Jae and Jung Woo Sung.

2356
01:18:03,377 --> 01:18:04,506
That's nice.

2357
01:18:04,507 --> 01:18:06,007
- But... - Han Na...

2358
01:18:06,277 --> 01:18:09,146
- Have you met anyone here before? - Yes?

2359
01:18:09,147 --> 01:18:10,216
- Among the members. - Yes.

2360
01:18:10,217 --> 01:18:11,217
We met a few days ago.
- We met. - It wasn't a few days ago.

2361
01:18:12,217 --> 01:18:13,217
- We met a few months ago. - Why?

2362
01:18:13,218 --> 01:18:14,846
- Why did you meet? - Why did you meet?

2363
01:18:14,847 --> 01:18:16,416
- Why did you meet? - He asked to boast about it.

2364
01:18:16,417 --> 01:18:17,656
- No. - What was that?

2365
01:18:17,657 --> 01:18:18,926
- Come on. - No.

2366
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:20,586
- We met by coincidence. - Why?

2367
01:18:20,587 --> 01:18:21,956
- Why did you meet? - A few months ago,

2368
01:18:21,957 --> 01:18:24,096
- we watched the musical "Aladdin." - No.

2369
01:18:24,097 --> 01:18:25,326
We didn't go there together.

2370
01:18:25,327 --> 01:18:27,026
She was sitting in front of me, so I just greeted her.

2371
01:18:27,027 --> 01:18:29,536
No one would think you went there together.

2372
01:18:29,537 --> 01:18:31,297
- Trust me. Exactly. - No one would think like that.

2373
01:18:31,367 --> 01:18:34,066
And I'm really enjoying "Mr. Radio."

2374
01:18:34,067 --> 01:18:35,606
- Thank you. - I'm a fan.

2375
01:18:35,607 --> 01:18:36,906
You were a DJ too.

2376
01:18:36,907 --> 01:18:38,707
- I listened to your show too. - Yes.

2377
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:40,077
Se Yoon.

2378
01:18:40,377 --> 01:18:43,076
Han Na is here. Show her the square.

2379
01:18:43,077 --> 01:18:45,016
- What? - Show her the square.

2380
01:18:45,017 --> 01:18:46,446
- A square? - She's here.

2381
01:18:46,447 --> 01:18:47,986
- There's something on him. - We have important guests...

2382
01:18:47,987 --> 01:18:49,757
Something seems wrong.

2383
01:18:49,917 --> 01:18:51,986
- We have important guests, so we... - The square...

2384
01:18:51,987 --> 01:18:53,686
- prepared a welcoming skit. - Okay.

2385
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:55,627
- You have to look at the square. - Yes.

2386
01:18:55,857 --> 01:18:57,926
Look at me.

2387
01:18:57,927 --> 01:18:59,027
A large square.

2388
01:19:00,497 --> 01:19:01,567
A large square.

2389
01:19:03,097 --> 01:19:04,097
A...

2390
01:19:04,567 --> 01:19:05,567
- What? - Who is it?

2391
01:19:05,568 --> 01:19:06,766
I got startled.

2392
01:19:06,767 --> 01:19:09,077
(The awkward air was cleared.)

2393
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:12,847
- I got startled. - Woo Il is here.

2394
01:19:12,877 --> 01:19:15,546
- Nice. - Who called him?

2395
01:19:15,547 --> 01:19:17,917
- Nice. - It's good to see you.

2396
01:19:18,047 --> 01:19:20,046
(We're seeing him again so soon.)

2397
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:22,047
- Who called him? - Goodness.

2398
01:19:22,617 --> 01:19:25,156
(He's Woo Il's big fan.)

2399
01:19:25,157 --> 01:19:26,856
- Jong Min. - It's Woo Il.

2400
01:19:26,857 --> 01:19:28,386
- What are you doing here? - I'm Woo Il Nine.

2401
01:19:28,387 --> 01:19:29,657
- Woo Il Nine. - Yes.

2402
01:19:34,267 --> 01:19:37,097
(Im Woo Il 9)

2403
01:19:37,237 --> 01:19:39,766
Hello.

2404
01:19:39,767 --> 01:19:42,976
I'm Woo Il, Jong Min's acquaintance.

2405
01:19:42,977 --> 01:19:45,806
- Woo Il is here. - He's here.

2406
01:19:45,807 --> 01:19:46,907
He's funny.

2407
01:19:47,547 --> 01:19:49,646
I'm curious.

2408
01:19:49,647 --> 01:19:51,116
Have you met Jong Min separately...

2409
01:19:51,117 --> 01:19:53,386
after the last shoot?

2410
01:19:53,387 --> 01:19:54,447
- No. - I knew it.

2411
01:19:54,917 --> 01:19:56,256
Did you become his acquaintance after that?

2412
01:19:56,257 --> 01:19:58,587
Yes. I received a call from an unknown number.

2413
01:19:59,187 --> 01:20:01,057
Are you Woo Il Seven?

2414
01:20:02,627 --> 01:20:03,997
- Who are you? - What?

2415
01:20:04,927 --> 01:20:06,667
- I have his number too. - Jong Min.

2416
01:20:06,897 --> 01:20:09,036
Do you know his surname?

2417
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:10,037
Kim Woo Il.

2418
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:11,196
(Woo Il's full name is Kim Woo Il?)

2419
01:20:11,197 --> 01:20:12,466
That's...

2420
01:20:12,467 --> 01:20:14,766
Woo Il Eight is Kim Woo Il.

2421
01:20:14,767 --> 01:20:15,876
Woo Il Eight.

2422
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:17,807
He invited him when he didn't even know his name.

2423
01:20:18,437 --> 01:20:20,006
- Last time... - What is this?

2424
01:20:20,007 --> 01:20:21,446
- So you can become an acquaintance. - Right.

2425
01:20:21,447 --> 01:20:23,016
You kept calling me Im Woo Il Seven...

2426
01:20:23,017 --> 01:20:24,746
and Im Woo Il Seven.

2427
01:20:24,747 --> 01:20:26,646
Do you know Han Na or Dex?

2428
01:20:26,647 --> 01:20:28,247
- Do you know each other? - It's my first time seeing him.

2429
01:20:29,087 --> 01:20:30,616
- Right? It's our first time. - Yes.

2430
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:33,686
I saw you a lot through YouTube videos.

2431
01:20:33,687 --> 01:20:34,957
Is it your first time seeing Dex?

2432
01:20:35,087 --> 01:20:38,056
I think I saw him at an event.

2433
01:20:38,057 --> 01:20:39,126
- Which event? - Right?

2434
01:20:39,127 --> 01:20:40,326
- At a wedding? - At a wedding?

2435
01:20:40,327 --> 01:20:41,926
We were on the same elevator.

2436
01:20:41,927 --> 01:20:42,967
Really?

2437
01:20:43,237 --> 01:20:44,967
- We're acquaintances. - That's hilarious.

2438
01:20:45,097 --> 01:20:46,406
- We're acquaintances. - Goodness.

2439
01:20:46,407 --> 01:20:47,836
- We're all acquaintances. - Right.

2440
01:20:47,837 --> 01:20:49,276
What about HANHAE?

2441
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:51,136
We went to a pension house before.

2442
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:52,406
- You remember. - Yes.

2443
01:20:52,407 --> 01:20:53,507
Why didn't you answer my call?

2444
01:20:53,647 --> 01:20:55,246
He doesn't seem to remember.

2445
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:56,377
(Seon Ho looks especially lonely.)

2446
01:20:57,847 --> 01:20:59,386
- We just have... - We have one more person to come.

2447
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,086
- Seon Ho's friend left. - My friend has to come.

2448
01:21:01,087 --> 01:21:02,087
- Seon Ho... - This...

2449
01:21:02,088 --> 01:21:03,386
Your friend is world-famous.

2450
01:21:03,387 --> 01:21:04,887
(Who is the world star to appear at the end?)

2451
01:21:05,187 --> 01:21:07,226
- It's... - You can't rest.

2452
01:21:07,227 --> 01:21:09,127
- What is it? - About 1.5 million.

2453
01:21:09,627 --> 01:21:11,297
- That's right. - My friend is here.

2454
01:21:11,897 --> 01:21:12,996
One, two, three.

2455
01:21:12,997 --> 01:21:14,126
- Who is it? - Who is it?

2456
01:21:14,127 --> 01:21:17,536
(Seon Ho's world star friend)

2457
01:21:17,537 --> 01:21:18,797
(G)I-DLE.

2458
01:21:21,067 --> 01:21:23,006
(A real world star appears.)

2459
01:21:23,007 --> 01:21:24,606
- (G)I-DLE. - SHUHUA.

2460
01:21:24,607 --> 01:21:26,576
- (G)I-DLE. - (G)I-DLE.

2461
01:21:26,577 --> 01:21:28,346
- (G)I-DLE. - She's really a world star.

2462
01:21:28,347 --> 01:21:30,447
The "Queencard" singer.

2463
01:21:30,977 --> 01:21:34,917
(They perform well in all concepts.)

2464
01:21:36,017 --> 01:21:38,357
(The 3rd generation girl group, (G)I-DLE)

2465
01:21:39,557 --> 01:21:41,927
(SHUHUA with a charm like a snow flower)

2466
01:21:43,497 --> 01:21:45,226
- She's my friend. - What's happening?

2467
01:21:45,227 --> 01:21:46,827
She's at the center.

2468
01:21:47,227 --> 01:21:48,996
- This... - Let's stay here.

2469
01:21:48,997 --> 01:21:50,596
- This is where we should be. - Let's stay here.

2470
01:21:50,597 --> 01:21:53,307
- This is our spot. - This is where we should be.

2471
01:21:53,507 --> 01:21:55,776
He bragged so much, but he did it for a reason.

2472
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:57,106
- Really. - He invited SHUHUA.

2473
01:21:57,107 --> 01:21:59,206
- Please introduce yourself. - Say hello.

2474
01:21:59,207 --> 01:22:01,406
Hello. I'm SHUHUA from (G)I-DLE.

2475
01:22:01,407 --> 01:22:03,547
(Seon Ho's friend, SHUHUA)

2476
01:22:03,577 --> 01:22:06,217
- How do you know each other? - Why are you friends with Seon Ho?

2477
01:22:06,847 --> 01:22:10,316
We trained together since I was 15 years old.

2478
01:22:10,317 --> 01:22:11,657
- You were trainees. - Really?

2479
01:22:11,817 --> 01:22:13,326
Who is older?

2480
01:22:13,327 --> 01:22:14,426
- Are you agemates? - She's older.

2481
01:22:14,427 --> 01:22:15,827
- She's older. - When were you born?

2482
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,356
- In 2000. - In 2000.

2483
01:22:17,357 --> 01:22:18,796
This wouldn't have been easy.

2484
01:22:18,797 --> 01:22:20,467
Is there a reason you agreed to come?

2485
01:22:20,697 --> 01:22:22,096
It was because...

2486
01:22:22,097 --> 01:22:23,696
I told her she could leave after eating a meal.

2487
01:22:23,697 --> 01:22:25,537
Right. There's no food.

2488
01:22:26,907 --> 01:22:29,337
(We'll give you food later.)

2489
01:22:29,407 --> 01:22:31,036
- We haven't heard anything. - 2 Days 1 Night...

2490
01:22:31,037 --> 01:22:34,507
is a show where you sleep for one night.

2491
01:22:35,147 --> 01:22:36,916
The title is 2 Days 1 Night.

2492
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:38,576
- One night, two days. - What's your schedule for tomorrow?

2493
01:22:38,577 --> 01:22:40,747
Tomorrow? I have one later.

2494
01:22:40,817 --> 01:22:42,486
- You have one later. - Later.

2495
01:22:42,487 --> 01:22:44,716
I think she came up with one now.

2496
01:22:44,717 --> 01:22:46,226
- Later. - I think she came up with one now.

2497
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:47,326
It just came up.

2498
01:22:47,327 --> 01:22:49,596
She was about to say something, but she said, "I have one later."

2499
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:50,827
She didn't even check.

2500
01:22:51,127 --> 01:22:52,157
Do you really have work?

2501
01:22:52,827 --> 01:22:53,897
No.

2502
01:22:54,727 --> 01:22:56,666
We may seem like losers, but do you see our friends?

2503
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:59,037
- Our friends are great. - See?

2504
01:22:59,137 --> 01:23:01,366
I'm very surprised.

2505
01:23:01,367 --> 01:23:02,577
Seriously.

2506
01:23:02,907 --> 01:23:04,777
- It's... - Applause!

2507
01:23:05,307 --> 01:23:07,106
Shall we sit?

2508
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:08,177
Yes.

2509
01:23:08,207 --> 01:23:11,377
- Your friends are all here. - They're all here.

2510
01:23:11,477 --> 01:23:13,647
Thank you all for coming.

2511
01:23:13,917 --> 01:23:16,057
We will have dinner...

2512
01:23:16,287 --> 01:23:18,716
with the friends.

2513
01:23:18,717 --> 01:23:20,126
- Yes. - We will have...

2514
01:23:20,127 --> 01:23:21,726
a dinner game.

2515
01:23:21,727 --> 01:23:22,896
Let's move to the location.

2516
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:24,297
- It won't be done here? - No.

2517
01:23:24,727 --> 01:23:26,366
We're going to play a game to eat dinner.

2518
01:23:26,367 --> 01:23:27,626
- I see. - You can have fun.

2519
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:29,097
- Outside? - I don't know.

2520
01:23:30,037 --> 01:23:31,696
I came because I was told you give good food.

2521
01:23:31,697 --> 01:23:33,836
- They give us good food. - Really?

2522
01:23:33,837 --> 01:23:35,506
- You won't lose your muscles. - Okay.

2523
01:23:35,507 --> 01:23:36,576
Don't worry.

2524
01:23:36,577 --> 01:23:38,676
- Let's do it. - We will prepare the meal.

2525
01:23:38,677 --> 01:23:40,606
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2526
01:23:40,607 --> 01:23:41,876
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2527
01:23:41,877 --> 01:23:44,776
Shall we take a group photo when we're all in good shape?

2528
01:23:44,777 --> 01:23:47,147
- Let's take it when we're okay. - Let's take it when we're okay.

2529
01:23:47,247 --> 01:23:48,517
- When we're okay? - No.

2530
01:23:48,917 --> 01:23:50,417
We're taking it as soon as we meet.

2531
01:23:51,017 --> 01:23:52,557
You get close when you film 2 Days 1 Night.

2532
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:55,796
- I'll take it. In 1, 2, 3. - 2 Days...

2533
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:56,926
- 2 Days... - 2 Days...

2534
01:23:56,927 --> 01:23:58,497
- 1 Night. - 1 Night.

2535
01:23:59,027 --> 01:24:01,966
(We just met, Making memories)

2536
01:24:01,967 --> 01:24:03,596
How have you been, Woo Il?

2537
01:24:03,597 --> 01:24:04,736
I've been well.

2538
01:24:04,737 --> 01:24:06,006
I heard you're resting.

2539
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,836
- I'm resting. - You're...

2540
01:24:07,837 --> 01:24:09,736
Thank you for coming.

2541
01:24:09,737 --> 01:24:11,676
He's from "Amazing Saturday."

2542
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:13,377
- We would have met from there. - Yes.

2543
01:24:13,577 --> 01:24:15,046
- It's been a while, Han Na. - Gosh, hello.

2544
01:24:15,047 --> 01:24:16,476
- Have you been well? - I have.

2545
01:24:16,477 --> 01:24:18,177
(They greet friends who they've not seen for a while.)

2546
01:24:18,347 --> 01:24:19,917
- Thank you. - It's nothing.

2547
01:24:20,117 --> 01:24:21,646
Thank you for coming.

2548
01:24:21,647 --> 01:24:23,357
(They shyly greet new friends.)

2549
01:24:23,457 --> 01:24:24,616
He doesn't have many friends, right?

2550
01:24:24,617 --> 01:24:26,986
- He doesn't. Joon... - I thought so too.

2551
01:24:26,987 --> 01:24:30,127
I thought he might not find anyone if I didn't go.

2552
01:24:30,257 --> 01:24:32,026
The atmosphere here is really nice.

2553
01:24:32,027 --> 01:24:34,126
- It's not bad. - It's really nice.

2554
01:24:34,127 --> 01:24:35,766
- It's comfortable here. - Hello.

2555
01:24:35,767 --> 01:24:37,166
I came to greet you.

2556
01:24:37,167 --> 01:24:39,336
It's an honor.

2557
01:24:39,337 --> 01:24:40,767
(Hoping they will be good friends after today)

2558
01:24:42,507 --> 01:24:43,507
What is this?

2559
01:24:43,508 --> 01:24:45,106
You aren't that good-looking.

2560
01:24:45,107 --> 01:24:46,877
Here's a funny person. Seriously.

2561
01:24:47,047 --> 01:24:48,646
Can I zoom in further?

2562
01:24:48,647 --> 01:24:50,247
- Let's see. - Can I zoom in further?

2563
01:24:52,377 --> 01:24:54,787
- Woo Il. - I'm not a handsome person.

2564
01:24:55,087 --> 01:24:56,257
You aren't.

2565
01:24:56,287 --> 01:24:57,387
Me neither.

2566
01:24:58,317 --> 01:24:59,826
Let's go. Let's get moving.

2567
01:24:59,827 --> 01:25:02,926
- Let's move. - Let's go. Let's win.

2568
01:25:02,927 --> 01:25:04,596
- Let's eat dinner. - You should expect...

2569
01:25:04,597 --> 01:25:07,427
- to lose if you're a team with me. - Meat.

2570
01:25:07,627 --> 01:25:09,836
We can do it. I'll...

2571
01:25:09,837 --> 01:25:12,267
- I can't do it. - I'll do my best.

2572
01:25:12,567 --> 01:25:15,306
It's nice with everyone here. It's crowded.

2573
01:25:15,307 --> 01:25:17,436
That's right. You'll probably end up...

2574
01:25:17,437 --> 01:25:19,506
- wanting to spend the night here. - Really?

2575
01:25:19,507 --> 01:25:20,546
Just wait and see.

2576
01:25:20,547 --> 01:25:22,377
- Don't be so sure yet. - Okay.

2577
01:25:23,147 --> 01:25:25,716
Today, things are a lot easier as the shoot takes place...

2578
01:25:25,717 --> 01:25:27,016
- in Seoul. - Right.

2579
01:25:27,017 --> 01:25:28,686
When I got here,

2580
01:25:28,687 --> 01:25:30,786
- you guys looked different... - Right, in Jeonju.

2581
01:25:30,787 --> 01:25:32,786
- from when we met in Jeonju. - We're different, right?

2582
01:25:32,787 --> 01:25:34,486
- You were completely different. - Right.

2583
01:25:34,487 --> 01:25:35,756
- It's somewhat... - We're in good condition.

2584
01:25:35,757 --> 01:25:37,426
Back then, you seemed a little tired.

2585
01:25:37,427 --> 01:25:39,497
- But today, you're energetic. - Right.

2586
01:25:39,797 --> 01:25:41,627
- It's loud with all the friends. - This is crazy.

2587
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:43,467
- Gosh, it's so loud. - It's too noisy.

2588
01:25:43,637 --> 01:25:44,737
Quiet!

2589
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:46,167
It's so loud.

2590
01:25:46,168 --> 01:25:48,106
- What's wrong? - That's because we're feeling well.

2591
01:25:48,107 --> 01:25:49,337
- We're being loud. - Let's split up and move.

2592
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:51,476
- Let's split up. - Okay.

2593
01:25:51,477 --> 01:25:52,906
- We will split up. - Let's split up.

2594
01:25:52,907 --> 01:25:54,207
- Press the button. - See you.

2595
01:25:54,777 --> 01:25:56,576
Hang on. Where are Cho Sae Ho and Nam Chang Hee?

2596
01:25:56,577 --> 01:25:58,147
The ugly ones always disappear first.

2597
01:25:58,347 --> 01:25:59,887
Are they putting on makeup?

2598
01:26:00,187 --> 01:26:01,487
What? Has the sun set already?

2599
01:26:01,647 --> 01:26:03,557
- When did the sun set? - Is it dark already?

2600
01:26:03,817 --> 01:26:04,957
It was bright earlier.

2601
01:26:05,817 --> 01:26:06,957
Guys.

2602
01:26:08,027 --> 01:26:09,357
What are you doing, guys?

2603
01:26:09,527 --> 01:26:10,757
What's that?

2604
01:26:12,097 --> 01:26:15,227
(The two men are standing on the KBS special stage.)

2605
01:26:15,397 --> 01:26:17,096
- What? - It's ChoNam Zone.

2606
01:26:17,097 --> 01:26:18,236
What is this?

2607
01:26:18,237 --> 01:26:19,936
(ChoNam Zone reveals their new song after 3 years.)

2608
01:26:19,937 --> 01:26:21,167
- What? Are they singing? - What are they doing?

2609
01:26:22,367 --> 01:26:23,837
- Why... - Nice.

2610
01:26:23,877 --> 01:26:25,307
("I Didn't Hear It Yet" by ChoNam Zone)

2611
01:26:28,577 --> 01:26:30,047
Don't you remember the lyrics?

2612
01:26:30,717 --> 01:26:32,587
What is going on?

2613
01:26:33,217 --> 01:26:35,147
- It's a little... - Even the in-ear headphones?

2614
01:26:35,647 --> 01:26:37,557
- Is he wearing in-ear headphones? - In-ear headphones?

2615
01:26:37,717 --> 01:26:38,916
They're performing live.

2616
01:26:38,917 --> 01:26:40,126
Are they crazy?

2617
01:26:40,127 --> 01:26:42,257
Does ChoNam Zone have to make their comeback like this?

2618
01:26:42,657 --> 01:26:43,797
Is this right?

2619
01:26:46,227 --> 01:26:47,327
His throat...

2620
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:53,737
- This is "Music Bank." - This is just like "Music Bank."

2621
01:26:54,307 --> 01:26:55,537
The mood is so nice.

2622
01:26:59,007 --> 01:27:00,077
It's their new song.

2623
01:27:00,507 --> 01:27:01,577
It's live.

2624
01:27:05,417 --> 01:27:07,147
Nam Chang Hee sounds stable.

2625
01:27:10,157 --> 01:27:11,257
Yes, he's a little...

2626
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:24,867
(Like this)

2627
01:27:25,897 --> 01:27:27,107
What was that?

2628
01:27:27,607 --> 01:27:29,337
- It was so nice. - Good job.

2629
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,207
- Thank you. - The song is really nice.

2630
01:27:31,337 --> 01:27:32,436
You're good.

2631
01:27:32,437 --> 01:27:33,646
- What? - That was great.

2632
01:27:33,647 --> 01:27:35,306
- Thank you. - ChoNam Zone.

2633
01:27:35,307 --> 01:27:37,016
Tell us about the song.

2634
01:27:37,017 --> 01:27:38,046
- Is ChoNam Zone coming back? - Yes.

2635
01:27:38,047 --> 01:27:39,986
Thank you so much.

2636
01:27:39,987 --> 01:27:41,787
- You don't need the microphone. - That's not needed.

2637
01:27:42,117 --> 01:27:43,986
- One is enough. - Thanks to your consideration,

2638
01:27:43,987 --> 01:27:46,086
- we got to sing our song. - You were amazing.

2639
01:27:46,087 --> 01:27:48,956
It's ChoNam Zone's new song, "I Didn't Hear It Yet."

2640
01:27:48,957 --> 01:27:50,126
- "I Didn't Hear It Yet." - Yes.

2641
01:27:50,127 --> 01:27:52,926
I haven't heard from her yet,

2642
01:27:52,927 --> 01:27:54,696
but we have to break up anyway.

2643
01:27:54,697 --> 01:27:56,866
It's a situation we're broken up even though I haven't heard it yet.

2644
01:27:56,867 --> 01:27:59,237
We expressed it with a song.

2645
01:27:59,337 --> 01:28:01,067
So it's like ghosting.

2646
01:28:02,037 --> 01:28:04,136
It was a congratulatory performance by ChoNam Zone.

2647
01:28:04,137 --> 01:28:05,807
- Please give them a big hand. - Thank you.

2648
01:28:07,377 --> 01:28:08,506
Nice.

2649
01:28:08,507 --> 01:28:10,317
All right. "The Seasons."

2650
01:28:12,117 --> 01:28:15,747
"The Seasons, Park Bo Gum's Cantabile."

2651
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:17,686
- Park Bo Gum? - What?

2652
01:28:17,687 --> 01:28:19,316
("Park Bo Gum's Cantabile")

2653
01:28:19,317 --> 01:28:20,427
The strong opponent of the show.

2654
01:28:20,727 --> 01:28:22,257
(I see.)

2655
01:28:22,827 --> 01:28:25,127
Moon Se Yoon's Mix Rice.

2656
01:28:25,197 --> 01:28:26,326
- "Mix Rice?" - I'm Moon Se Yoon.

2657
01:28:26,327 --> 01:28:27,667
Hello. Nice to meet you.

2658
01:28:27,767 --> 01:28:28,966
Nice to meet you.

2659
01:28:28,967 --> 01:28:31,466
Please love and support our show.

2660
01:28:31,467 --> 01:28:33,506
All right. Now it's time...

2661
01:28:33,507 --> 01:28:35,636
to start Dinner Game.

2662
01:28:35,637 --> 01:28:36,736
- Really? - Yes!

2663
01:28:36,737 --> 01:28:37,977
Before we start...

2664
01:28:38,237 --> 01:28:40,077
We are still being a little stiff...

2665
01:28:40,347 --> 01:28:42,006
- and awkward now. - Right.

2666
01:28:42,007 --> 01:28:43,316
- We're still feeling awkward. - It's awkward.

2667
01:28:43,317 --> 01:28:45,747
This is the time where we can become one mind.

2668
01:28:46,047 --> 01:28:48,386
This is Best Friend Dance Battle.

2669
01:28:48,387 --> 01:28:50,016
- Let's begin! - Yes!

2670
01:28:50,017 --> 01:28:52,017
- Yes! - Yes!

2671
01:28:52,687 --> 01:28:54,187
- Yes! - A dance battle.

2672
01:28:54,457 --> 01:28:55,727
Best Friend Dance Battle.

2673
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:58,027
Best Friend Dance Battle. When music plays,

2674
01:28:58,257 --> 01:28:59,926
if you think the song is perfect for you and your friend,

2675
01:28:59,927 --> 01:29:01,367
you should come up on the stage.

2676
01:29:01,627 --> 01:29:03,566
- We should dance together? - I see.

2677
01:29:03,567 --> 01:29:05,766
- If you dance first... - We should dance shuffle.

2678
01:29:05,767 --> 01:29:06,836
- They're practicing. - This is it for us.

2679
01:29:06,837 --> 01:29:08,707
- Dex is practicing. - Shall we do this?

2680
01:29:08,767 --> 01:29:10,776
Han Na and Joon. Joon, you should lead the dance.

2681
01:29:10,777 --> 01:29:12,106
- Okay. - If you think it's your tune...

2682
01:29:12,107 --> 01:29:13,806
Pick a song...

2683
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:15,646
that will make Han Na shine and come on up.

2684
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:17,047
All right, then.

2685
01:29:17,217 --> 01:29:18,876
Who will dance to the first song?

2686
01:29:18,877 --> 01:29:21,087
Music, please.

2687
01:29:21,947 --> 01:29:23,957
(A familiar melody that catches your ears)

2688
01:29:24,817 --> 01:29:26,356
- Gosh, this is... - This is the song.

2689
01:29:26,357 --> 01:29:27,626
- Oh, no. - Come on up.

2690
01:29:27,627 --> 01:29:29,126
- Jong Min. - This is the song.

2691
01:29:29,127 --> 01:29:30,127
- Go. - Who's coming up?

2692
01:29:30,128 --> 01:29:31,296
(Master Dancer Kim Jong Min)

2693
01:29:31,297 --> 01:29:32,357
- Go. - Who is it?

2694
01:29:32,797 --> 01:29:36,397
(Dancing King Jong Min, who dominated the dance floor back then)

2695
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:38,396
(The king heads to the stage.)

2696
01:29:38,397 --> 01:29:39,907
- Should we go first? - There they are.

2697
01:29:40,037 --> 01:29:41,336
They're up. Kim Jong Min.

2698
01:29:41,337 --> 01:29:43,137
(What is the move Jong Min and Woo Il are showing?)

2699
01:29:43,507 --> 01:29:45,537
(Nice!)

2700
01:29:45,837 --> 01:29:47,477
(A flood of criticism)

2701
01:29:47,607 --> 01:29:49,076
I knew they would do that.

2702
01:29:49,077 --> 01:29:50,577
A little more.

2703
01:29:52,447 --> 01:29:53,647
(The timeless movement of the pelvis)

2704
01:29:55,217 --> 01:29:57,757
I'm sorry, but things are getting more awkward now.

2705
01:29:57,887 --> 01:29:59,486
- It's even more awkward. - Please change the song.

2706
01:29:59,487 --> 01:30:01,057
- The second song. - This is crazy.

2707
01:30:04,627 --> 01:30:07,226
- Are we dancing again? - Come on down.

2708
01:30:07,227 --> 01:30:08,396
Who's next?

2709
01:30:08,397 --> 01:30:09,936
- Let's see it. - Let's go.

2710
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:11,737
(We are the real owners of this stage!)

2711
01:30:12,597 --> 01:30:13,706
Are you following me well?

2712
01:30:13,707 --> 01:30:15,166
(Light footwork that doesn't feel heavy at all)

2713
01:30:15,167 --> 01:30:16,336
- Do it alone. - Nice.

2714
01:30:16,337 --> 01:30:17,507
- They're fatties. - They should do the same move.

2715
01:30:17,677 --> 01:30:19,477
- Obese Beyonce. - This is crazy.

2716
01:30:19,677 --> 01:30:22,346
(Flashy movements that threaten the original artist)

2717
01:30:22,347 --> 01:30:24,477
That's dirty.

2718
01:30:24,747 --> 01:30:26,886
- Music, please. Get ready. - The song...

2719
01:30:26,887 --> 01:30:28,347
- Who's up next? - She's good.

2720
01:30:28,647 --> 01:30:30,317
- SHUHUA. - She's on it.

2721
01:30:31,357 --> 01:30:33,527
(This is SHUHUA.)

2722
01:30:35,287 --> 01:30:37,997
- As expected. - Seon Ho, come on down.

2723
01:30:38,127 --> 01:30:40,467
- Seon Ho, leave her alone. - SHUHUA.

2724
01:30:40,967 --> 01:30:42,667
(Then I'll dance here.)

2725
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:44,497
(A refreshing performance of the youngest members)

2726
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:47,667
What?

2727
01:30:48,007 --> 01:30:50,437
- "APT!" - Let's start together.

2728
01:30:50,677 --> 01:30:53,606
- APT, APT - You're cute!

2729
01:30:53,607 --> 01:30:55,747
- APT, APT - Let's go, DinDin.

2730
01:30:56,947 --> 01:30:58,276
We did well.

2731
01:30:58,277 --> 01:31:00,046
- It's not over yet. - Come on.

2732
01:31:00,047 --> 01:31:01,146
- It's not over yet. - It was too short.

2733
01:31:01,147 --> 01:31:02,386
- Go, Dex. - Let's go.

2734
01:31:02,387 --> 01:31:04,057
(Dex's solo performance, let's go!)

2735
01:31:04,117 --> 01:31:05,357
- Go, Dex. - Let's go.

2736
01:31:05,587 --> 01:31:08,357
(Sexy moves)

2737
01:31:09,357 --> 01:31:11,597
(Showing off his testosterone without hesitation)

2738
01:31:11,857 --> 01:31:13,667
(I was like him when I was young.)

2739
01:31:13,727 --> 01:31:17,067
(When Jong Min was showing off his testosterone)

2740
01:31:17,197 --> 01:31:18,237
We should go up.

2741
01:31:20,807 --> 01:31:22,907
- This is the song. - There you go.

2742
01:31:23,637 --> 01:31:24,777
Let's go. One.

2743
01:31:26,577 --> 01:31:28,206
(The perfect group dance of the singers with 7 albums)

2744
01:31:28,207 --> 01:31:29,677
ChoNam Zone.

2745
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:31,717
- This is the highlight. - We're not done yet.

2746
01:31:31,817 --> 01:31:33,146
- Han Na. - You should go.

2747
01:31:33,147 --> 01:31:34,516
- It's their turn. - Go.

2748
01:31:34,517 --> 01:31:36,356
What do we do? I can't do this.

2749
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:37,487
(Feeling more pressured)

2750
01:31:38,217 --> 01:31:39,357
What do we do?

2751
01:31:39,627 --> 01:31:40,787
They didn't dance yet.

2752
01:31:40,927 --> 01:31:42,726
(We should enjoy it!)

2753
01:31:42,727 --> 01:31:43,856
What?

2754
01:31:43,857 --> 01:31:45,627
What do I do?

2755
01:31:46,397 --> 01:31:48,767
(Intense moves that capture your attention)

2756
01:31:48,997 --> 01:31:50,036
(Eye-catching)

2757
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:51,766
- She's no joke. - She dances well.

2758
01:31:51,767 --> 01:31:52,966
- My goodness. - What do I do?

2759
01:31:52,967 --> 01:31:54,107
(Follow me, Joon.)

2760
01:31:54,767 --> 01:31:56,407
(Lee Joon, the dance major is on.)

2761
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:57,777
She dances well.

2762
01:31:58,477 --> 01:31:59,477
That's it.

2763
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:01,006
(Dance moves that are strangely captivating)

2764
01:32:01,007 --> 01:32:02,076
This is amazing.

2765
01:32:02,077 --> 01:32:03,077
(They can't help but give it up for them.)

2766
01:32:03,817 --> 01:32:05,616
- She's so good. - There you go!

2767
01:32:05,617 --> 01:32:07,587
- What? She's so good. - Just enjoy it.

2768
01:32:07,987 --> 01:32:08,987
What?

2769
01:32:09,117 --> 01:32:10,256
This is nice.

2770
01:32:10,257 --> 01:32:11,386
- What is going on? - She's so good.

2771
01:32:11,387 --> 01:32:13,257
Kang Han Na!

2772
01:32:13,487 --> 01:32:15,686
(In the zone)

2773
01:32:15,687 --> 01:32:18,027
- Kang Han Na! - What?

2774
01:32:18,197 --> 01:32:19,627
- Nice! Give them a big hand. - What was that?

2775
01:32:20,997 --> 01:32:22,166
Han Na is really...

2776
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:24,196
- She was really fast. - That was shocking.

2777
01:32:24,197 --> 01:32:25,467
(Han Na's dance moves even shocked the dancing king.)

2778
01:32:25,537 --> 01:32:26,836
She suddenly changed.

2779
01:32:26,837 --> 01:32:28,606
- Her hands are really fast. - Can you dance as an encore?

2780
01:32:28,607 --> 01:32:29,676
- No. - Encore!

2781
01:32:29,677 --> 01:32:31,236
- Please show us again. - Encore!

2782
01:32:31,237 --> 01:32:32,306
She was like this.

2783
01:32:32,307 --> 01:32:33,677
(Music plays.)

2784
01:32:33,847 --> 01:32:36,747
- Okay. - There you go!

2785
01:32:36,947 --> 01:32:38,517
(Her arms and legs start swinging again.)

2786
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:41,887
- There you go! - What?

2787
01:32:42,347 --> 01:32:43,716
What's that?

2788
01:32:43,717 --> 01:32:44,957
How does she do that?

2789
01:32:45,457 --> 01:32:46,756
(Like this!)

2790
01:32:46,757 --> 01:32:48,456
- You're so pretty! - Kang Han Na!

2791
01:32:48,457 --> 01:32:49,956
(The dancing machine's performance was perfect even for the encore.)

2792
01:32:49,957 --> 01:32:51,597
She's so talented.

2793
01:32:52,197 --> 01:32:53,966
(The touching performance lingers for a long time.)

2794
01:32:53,967 --> 01:32:54,967
Her hands and feet move separately.
She's amazing.

2795
01:32:55,968 --> 01:32:57,496
Things are heating up now.

2796
01:32:57,497 --> 01:32:58,737
All right.

2797
01:32:58,867 --> 01:33:02,437
Now, I'll hand over the MC position to Director Joo.

2798
01:33:02,567 --> 01:33:04,576
This is it for Moon Se Yoon's Mix Rice.

2799
01:33:04,577 --> 01:33:06,447
- Yes! - It will be back. Thank you!

2800
01:33:06,507 --> 01:33:07,507
(It will be back next time.)

2801
01:33:07,508 --> 01:33:08,847
Mix Rice!

2802
01:33:09,047 --> 01:33:10,417
- He's good. - Are you sweating?

2803
01:33:10,477 --> 01:33:12,347
(Next episode)

2804
01:33:12,717 --> 01:33:15,217
(With the best friends)

2805
01:33:15,887 --> 01:33:18,057
(The exciting variety show party)

2806
01:33:18,957 --> 01:33:21,857
(This is a festival.)

2807
01:33:22,387 --> 01:33:25,297
(In a trance)

2808
01:33:25,457 --> 01:33:28,297
(This is only the beginning.)

2809
01:33:29,367 --> 01:33:31,866
(This variety show...)

2810
01:33:31,867 --> 01:33:33,437
(is tougher than expected.)

2811
01:33:33,907 --> 01:33:35,907
(Please help SHUHUA.)

2812
01:33:37,677 --> 01:33:39,976
(The world of variety shows)

2813
01:33:39,977 --> 01:33:42,707
(This is what it is like.)

2814
01:33:43,647 --> 01:33:45,876
(An incredible night...)

2815
01:33:45,877 --> 01:33:48,447
(for those who are drifting around KBS)

2816
01:33:48,647 --> 01:33:49,816
Salute!

2817
01:33:49,817 --> 01:33:51,187
(See you on Sunday night at 6:10pm.)
