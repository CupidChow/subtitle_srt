1
00:00:01,203 --> 00:00:04,203
(Join DAY6...)

2
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:10,483
(on a refreshing and joyful summer trip.)

3
00:00:11,443 --> 00:00:14,883
(To partake in a beef and pork barbecue, )

4
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:18,182
(Teams Dojin and Youngpil...)

5
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:19,923
(fight into the summer night.)

6
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:22,363
Well done.

7
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:24,963
(As a result of the barbecue war, )

8
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:28,333
(Team Youngpil gets to eat.)

9
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:31,233
(Feeling bitter)

10
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,672
(Thanks for the meal.)

11
00:00:35,673 --> 00:00:36,902
Wrap it in rice.

12
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,573
Dip and try just the meat.

13
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:42,913
(While it smells like a barbecue here, )

14
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,953
(this layout is extremely lacking.)

15
00:00:47,453 --> 00:00:49,453
(Is there a can of tuna under your cap?)

16
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:53,423
(Of course not.)

17
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,352
(If...)

18
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:56,722
(No way.)

19
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,422
If the winners are okay with it...

20
00:00:58,423 --> 00:00:59,962
Yes! I'm okay with it!

21
00:00:59,963 --> 00:01:00,993
We'll do anything!

22
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:03,963
Just one person from the losing team...

23
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:05,033
One person.

24
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:07,233
Can win the right to join the winners' table.

25
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:09,873
- Join it completely?
- Oh, join us?

26
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,273
Would you accept that?

27
00:01:11,643 --> 00:01:13,213
- Should we?
- We'll allow it.

28
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:14,572
- Okay.
- It's a yes.

29
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:16,542
The food will disappear as the game goes on.

30
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,242
- That's understandable.
- We understand that.

31
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:21,082
Everyone. Can you see the drum over there?

32
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,153
- Yes.
- Yes.

33
00:01:22,953 --> 00:01:25,282
(A random drum sits across from them.)

34
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:27,623
We'll place a piece of snack on the drum.

35
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:29,522
- Then you'll hit the drum.
- Okay.

36
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,099
- Then the snack will fly up, right?
- Yes.

37
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:32,883
You have to catch the snack with your mouth.

38
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:34,362
That's not a bad game.

39
00:01:34,363 --> 00:01:35,563
- Nice.
- Okay.

40
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,662
- Whoever succeeds first will eat.
- Did they bring the drum?

41
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:40,872
Or did they come up with this game because they saw a drum here?

42
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:42,342
I think the drum happened to be here.

43
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:43,373
- Really?
- Right.

44
00:01:43,743 --> 00:01:46,472
They're determined to come up with games.

45
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,612
- Of course.
- They're geniuses.

46
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:49,382
If you join them on orientation trips...

47
00:01:49,383 --> 00:01:50,782
(The relief mission will begin now.)

48
00:01:50,783 --> 00:01:52,489
- I got the hang of it.
- You try it, Wonpil.

49
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:53,513
I got the hang of it.

50
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,459
- You must catch it with your mouth.
- I think I can do this.

51
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,003
- Catch it with your mouth.
- Hold on.

52
00:01:57,223 --> 00:01:59,023
- Catch it with your mouth.
- Okay. Wait.

53
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:00,192
Hit the center.

54
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:02,323
(That looks easy.)

55
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,193
- Okay. Let's go.
- Gosh.

56
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,669
(He fails as it bounces off his philtrum.)

57
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:09,732
(Disappointed)

58
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:11,602
- That's doable. This is fun.
- I think I can do this.

59
00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:13,332
All right. Then the winning team...

60
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,733
(Snatching it up faster than light)

61
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,703
(Food on the floor is fair game.)

62
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:22,243
(Don't eat the food from the floor. Win and eat the meat.)

63
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:23,912
The order is important for this game.

64
00:02:23,913 --> 00:02:25,283
- Right.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

65
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,182
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

66
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:29,553
(SungJin, Dowoon, Joon, Jong Min, and Se Yoon)

67
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:31,653
- Please give it to them.
- SungJin is first.

68
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:34,552
(Nervous)

69
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:36,222
If he succeeds, it's over for us.

70
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,722
It's over? We don't get a chance?

71
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:38,993
(Utterly nervous)

72
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:42,663
- What?
- My gosh.

73
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,273
(Unfortunately, the snack bounces off his lips.)

74
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:53,642
(SungJin fails.)

75
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:54,912
(Yes!)

76
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:56,843
Gosh, seriously. SungJin.

77
00:02:57,183 --> 00:02:58,512
I got to smell flour, though.

78
00:02:58,513 --> 00:02:59,983
- Gosh, SungJin had a shot.
- Here.

79
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:01,782
Honestly, I didn't realize it as a viewer.

80
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:02,822
- You can't.
- Of course not.

81
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:03,852
- You can't.
- You know what?

82
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:05,792
- You give your all to it.
- You can't help but do that.

83
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:07,222
- You give your all to it.
- Everyone must experience it.

84
00:03:07,223 --> 00:03:08,792
He's the drummer of the band.

85
00:03:08,793 --> 00:03:10,493
(Dowoon is the second one to try.)

86
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:11,723
The drummer.

87
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,233
Three.

88
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,833
That was close.

89
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:16,603
(The snack flies by his mouth.)

90
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,172
- That was close.
- I licked it with my tongue.

91
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:22,102
- It could've been bad for us.
- Gosh, he scared me for a second.

92
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:23,642
(That was close.)

93
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:24,942
Gosh, he scared me for a second.

94
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:28,173
(He uses this spare time to eat carbs for the next round.)

95
00:03:28,473 --> 00:03:30,243
Gosh, seriously. Please let me have it.

96
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:32,652
- Shall we grill some pork belly?
- Let's go.

97
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:34,133
- Yes.
- Let's grill some pork belly.

98
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:36,652
- I'm putting it on the grill.
- Let's do it.

99
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:37,653
- There's a breeze from the AC.
- Okay.

100
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:39,453
You can do this. Go for it.

101
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:41,222
Joon is good at these bonus games.

102
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:42,663
(Joon is the expert at bonus games.)

103
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:49,662
(Going in perfectly)

104
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:50,733
Okay.

105
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,532
(Joon succeeds.)

106
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:55,572
- Did he do it?
- Yes!

107
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:56,742
- He did it.
- Good job.

108
00:03:56,743 --> 00:03:58,542
(Squirming with joy)

109
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:00,473
Yes. This is Joon's lucky day.

110
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:02,482
- You really worked hard today.
- Joon.

111
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:03,582
Joon, come and join us. Hurry.

112
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,512
(As Joon worked hard, he deserves to have pork belly.)

113
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,453
- Yes.
- Joon.

114
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:09,052
- He worked hard.
- Seriously.

115
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:10,333
(Joon joins the barbecue party.)

116
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:12,392
Congratulations, Joon.

117
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:13,492
(They grill the pork belly right away.)

118
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:14,652
Come and have some food.

119
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:16,392
- We left you some beef.
- Let us grill some beef for you.

120
00:04:16,393 --> 00:04:17,993
- We left you some beef.
- Really?

121
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:20,093
Hey. Could you...

122
00:04:20,463 --> 00:04:21,932
- Isn't it too salty?
- Congratulations.

123
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:24,602
(I'm over the moon right now.)

124
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:25,802
This is a fun game.

125
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:27,873
- The look they're giving us...
- This is so good.

126
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:32,542
(Giving off a desperate look)

127
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:33,713
Let's do this.

128
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,913
When we eat 2 pieces, Joon can eat 1.

129
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:39,573
We can let 1 of you have 1 piece for every 3 pieces we eat.

130
00:04:40,183 --> 00:04:41,352
Tell him to know his place.

131
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:42,522
(Input saved)

132
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:44,623
Know your place.

133
00:04:45,123 --> 00:04:46,292
(Laughing)

134
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:47,492
Wonpil was talking.

135
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:49,322
- How dare you?
- Know your place on the show.

136
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:50,939
Tell him they'll get 1 piece for every 4 pieces.

137
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:52,593
Wonpil was talking.

138
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,192
How about 1 piece for every 4 pieces?

139
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,102
- One piece for every four pieces?
- Okay.

140
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:58,002
- Okay. They'll do it.
- They gaslighted us.

141
00:04:58,003 --> 00:04:59,472
- Only one of you can join us.
- We ran out of the snack.

142
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:01,313
- This is fun.
- Why did you finish the snack?

143
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:04,442
Why did you finish the snack?

144
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:05,603
(This guy is something else.)

145
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:07,172
He did it.

146
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,613
(As soon as Joon succeeded, )

147
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:13,783
(he started to munch on the snack.)

148
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:17,523
(There's even an accomplice.)

149
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:20,122
- Seriously. Just this once.
- I hope you succeed.

150
00:05:20,123 --> 00:05:21,193
(He gets another chance.)

151
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:25,623
(Oh, no.)

152
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,302
(He leaps toward the snack, but unfortunately, he fails.)

153
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:30,332
My gosh. What was that?

154
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,232
What if he pretended to go for it and ate the meat?

155
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,303
Next.

156
00:05:33,773 --> 00:05:35,943
- It's so hard to eat the snack.
- Good luck.

157
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:39,443
(Nice catch)

158
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:43,742
- Did he do it?
- Yes.

159
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,042
(The snack perfectly goes into his mouth.)

160
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,953
- Dowoon, come here.
- Dowoon, join us.

161
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:49,822
- We're grilling pork belly.
- This is...

162
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:50,883
Dowoon.

163
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:54,423
(He has his first touching bite.)

164
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:57,122
(The tender meat spreads happiness all over his mouth.)

165
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,622
- This is crazy.
- The pork belly is almost done.

166
00:05:58,623 --> 00:05:59,662
- Eat the pork belly.
- Dowoon.

167
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:01,432
- Gosh, this is crazy.
- Isn't it good?

168
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,002
(He finally tastes the meat after many struggles.)

169
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:04,732
Dowoon, it washes away the fatigue, right?

170
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:05,872
I'm so happy.

171
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:07,832
- Do you do that at home?
- Let me do it.

172
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,143
What is this? What happened to the other one?

173
00:06:10,273 --> 00:06:11,672
- There's a lot of food here.
- There it is.

174
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:12,973
It's not bad.

175
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:14,412
He's something else.

176
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:17,053
(He's planning to cook their ramyeon and eat some meat in return.)

177
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:20,983
What are you doing?

178
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:22,312
He's eating the uncooked ramyeon noodles.

179
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:23,582
(He's caught red-handed, munching on uncooked ramyeon crumbs.)

180
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,303
- I won't cook it for you then.
- Jong Min.

181
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:28,392
- You took your cut, right?
- No.

182
00:06:28,393 --> 00:06:29,822
(The crumbs will be his cut, not the meat?)

183
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,962
I put aside a piece of beef for you, but you leave me no choice.

184
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:33,033
You did?

185
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:34,562
I was going to make one for you.

186
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:37,363
The crumbs will be your cut, right?

187
00:06:39,873 --> 00:06:41,673
Young K made a wrap for me.

188
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:47,113
(The wrap fills his mouth.)

189
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,412
It's got both beef and pork belly.

190
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:51,053
(Thanks to Young K, he gets a beef wrap.)

191
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:52,913
- Pork belly is tastier.
- Is it good?

192
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:54,412
- That's good.
- It's so good.

193
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,133
- Did you try the pork belly?
- It's tasty.

194
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,552
Hey, I don't need to eat the meat.

195
00:06:58,553 --> 00:06:59,852
Can't you make a wrap for SungJin?

196
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,522
- Gosh.
- He prepared an acrostic poem.

197
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:02,762
- What did you prepare?
- Great.

198
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:04,163
- What was that?
- Great.

199
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:05,462
Is the poem about pork belly? What is it?

200
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:06,632
Beef? Which one do you want?

201
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:07,762
- What did you prepare?
- How about beef?

202
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:09,133
- Beef should be good.
- Beef?

203
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,333
B.

204
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:12,703
Brothers, spare me a piece of your precious pork belly.

205
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,972
- E.
- E.

206
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,043
Either that, or I throw down the table.

207
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,903
Great. I like it.

208
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:20,242
F.

209
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:22,243
Right. What should I say for the last line?

210
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:24,383
- He failed.
- Oh, no.

211
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:25,852
- That was a weak poem.
- Right.

212
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:27,229
- It's not easy.
- The second line was good, though.

213
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:29,883
The second line was excellent with the authentic dialect.

214
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:31,682
- SungJin.
- Yes?

215
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,452
Pick one. Left hand or right hand. One, two, three.

216
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,523
Left hand.

217
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:37,663
- This is it.
- He's taking the meat.

218
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:39,793
I'd kill for some ice cream.

219
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:41,562
- It's good.
- I want one too.

220
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:42,662
(He accepts the meat in a polite pose.)

221
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:43,663
How is it?

222
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,833
(It's tasty.)

223
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:47,802
- Se Yoon.
- I want one too.

224
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:49,033
Left hand or right hand?

225
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,073
- Seriously.
- Left hand or right hand?

226
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:52,403
We're taking this seriously.

227
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,473
- Right hand.
- Right hand.

228
00:07:55,573 --> 00:07:57,013
- That's it.
- It's garlic.

229
00:07:57,113 --> 00:07:59,042
- What? Gosh.
- My goodness.

230
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,553
I had a chili pepper in my left hand.

231
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,213
What a bummer.

232
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:04,023
What a bummer.

233
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:06,553
Smelling ramyeon will drive me crazy.

234
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,522
(Wonpil turns around with a wrap.)

235
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:10,622
Ramyeon noodles must be al dente.

236
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,762
(He's basically proposing to me.)

237
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:13,962
- Seriously. I love you.
- Hold on.

238
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:15,792
- Are you for real? Is that for me?
- You must eat this now.

239
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:18,062
(Se Yoon's fan is kindhearted.)

240
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:19,473
You made this wrap, right?

241
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:22,202
- Sae Ho didn't make it, right?
- No.

242
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:23,273
Does it have raw garlic?

243
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:27,772
(Turning into Mr. Adorable)

244
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,012
We should add the aged kimchi in the ramyeon.

245
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:31,912
No, we're going to add it.

246
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:32,983
- It had meat.
- Why?

247
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,613
Since when?

248
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:39,523
(Thanks to Wonpil, he recharges on happiness.)

249
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,723
- Okay.
- What do you need?

250
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:45,492
(Meanwhile, the ramyeon gets fully cooked.)

251
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:46,793
I have to bring it to a boil.

252
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:49,902
(Jong Min's ramyeon never fails to be tasty.)

253
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,232
- Try it with that.
- Here you go.

254
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,373
Have some more.

255
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:58,103
(Slurping)

256
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:02,683
(Everyone starts enjoying the noodles with excitement.)

257
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:04,412
How many bags of ramyeon did you cook?

258
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:05,413
(Is the ramyeon tasty?)

259
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,183
I think they cooked six bags of it.

260
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,983
(The eldest brother is looking for an opportunity.)

261
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:12,692
Let me give them some ramyeon. I cooked it, after all.

262
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:14,329
(Let me take some ramyeon as a reward for my labor.)

263
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,662
If you guys don't want more ramyeon, can we give this to the other team?

264
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:17,692
- Sure.
- Of course.

265
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:18,962
- Okay.
- Really?

266
00:09:18,963 --> 00:09:20,163
Eat a lot.

267
00:09:20,363 --> 00:09:22,493
- Really?
- Can we get more rice?

268
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:25,123
- Of course, we should get a refill.
- The broth too.

269
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,872
(Rushing over)

270
00:09:27,873 --> 00:09:29,202
- Good job.
- That was hot.

271
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:30,849
- You brought the entire pot?
- Well done.

272
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:31,903
- Great job.
- What?

273
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,142
- Great job. That's a lot of food.
- All right.

274
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:35,472
- There it is.
- Dig in.

275
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:37,219
- Thank you so much.
- This is the real deal.

276
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,482
Thank you so much.

277
00:09:38,483 --> 00:09:40,882
SungJin is here as a guest, but he's having a tough day.

278
00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:42,283
He ought to eat decent food.

279
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:44,783
- SungJin had the toughest day.
- Have some.

280
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:46,322
- That's the reward.
- Seriously, he had it tough.

281
00:09:46,323 --> 00:09:47,652
- He had a tough day.
- Actually,

282
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,893
- if we were close...
- He couldn't eat anything decent.

283
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:52,162
(He's busy eating ramyeon.)

284
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:53,363
Gosh, we finished everything.

285
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:55,392
(He wraps the noodles with kimchi and has a bite.)

286
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:56,702
Se Yoon is having a proper bite.

287
00:09:56,703 --> 00:09:57,903
Check this out.

288
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:00,472
(Slurping)

289
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:02,643
Se Yoon makes the food look so appetizing. Seriously.

290
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:04,043
It's tasty.

291
00:10:04,873 --> 00:10:06,312
Do you want to eat it with a piece of meat?

292
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:08,473
- Yes, we can do that.
- Have it with a piece of meat.

293
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,042
The pork neck is so tasty.

294
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,212
- Meat sounds good. That one.
- This one.

295
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:13,213
- Here.
- Give it to him.

296
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:14,812
- Thank you.
- No, I'm having the noodles...

297
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:15,882
with the kimchi.

298
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:16,923
Over there.

299
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:21,893
(Furiously inhaling the food)

300
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:24,123
- It's hot.
- This is hot.

301
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,462
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

302
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:26,823
(He gets ready to enjoy his bite.)

303
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:30,602
(He eats everything in one bite.)

304
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:32,362
- This is amazing.
- He's really enjoying the food.

305
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:33,872
- Seriously.
- The broth too.

306
00:10:33,873 --> 00:10:35,302
I never thought I'd watch him eat up close.

307
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:36,472
(In the front row for Se Yoon's eating show)

308
00:10:36,473 --> 00:10:38,002
Wonpil, you are indeed very close.

309
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:40,013
(You are indeed very close.)

310
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:44,143
(A friendly gesture for his fan)

311
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,389
- You're watching him up close.
- Gosh, seriously.

312
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,173
- You're watching him up close.
- Seriously.

313
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:52,852
That's funny. Se Yoon is the best.

314
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,129
(He's the most lovable man when he's eating.)

315
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,323
- Se Yoon is the best.
- This is so fun.

316
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,922
- Let's sit down.
- Yes.

317
00:10:58,923 --> 00:11:01,363
- Great. It's nice and slippery.
- My gosh.

318
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:03,902
All right. Here I am with Wonpil.

319
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:06,103
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

320
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:09,672
I believe 80 percent of DAY6 is attributed to you.

321
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:11,043
(Laughing)

322
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:12,642
- Was that your answer?
- Yes.

323
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:14,042
(Was your laughter the answer?)

324
00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:15,572
Wonpil, are you good at arm wrestling?

325
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:16,582
- Me?
- Yes.

326
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,783
Can I arm wrestle against you?

327
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:19,183
- Me?
- Yes.

328
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:21,552
- I'll give you a chance.
- I want to experience your power.

329
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:23,452
- Okay. Let's give it a try.
- Your overwhelming power.

330
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:26,253
You know what? I'm pretty sure I'm in the top three...

331
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:27,592
when it comes to arm wrestling...

332
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:28,713
- among celebrities.
- Okay.

333
00:11:29,393 --> 00:11:31,063
- Can I feel your muscles?
- Sure.

334
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:33,533
- I have no muscles.
- You have dense muscles.

335
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,033
My gosh.

336
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:37,362
Gosh. This is...

337
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,862
- Get ready, - I'll never get this chance again.

338
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:40,173
Set, go.

339
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:42,073
My gosh.

340
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:45,672
- You might beat him, Seon Ho.
- My gosh.

341
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:46,812
- Really?
- I'm serious.

342
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:48,612
- Wonpil.
- My gosh.

343
00:11:48,613 --> 00:11:51,312
Play against this guy.

344
00:11:51,313 --> 00:11:53,013
I once lost to a female writer.

345
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:55,682
I don't think I can beat you.

346
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:57,152
- Is Wonpil another weakling?
- All right.

347
00:11:57,153 --> 00:11:58,852
Wonpil, you're clueless. Don't push your arm out.

348
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:00,052
- Bend it close to you.
- Get ready.

349
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,122
You have to straighten up your arm like this at a smaller angle.

350
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:03,722
- Get ready, set, go.
- He must know, but...

351
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,793
He's good.

352
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,092
- Really?
- That hurts.

353
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:10,102
(Seon Ho wins.)

354
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:11,702
- Wonpil must be easy to beat.
- Yes.

355
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:12,802
- Yes.
- He must be easy to beat.

356
00:12:12,803 --> 00:12:13,832
- It was easy to beat Wonpil.
- Wonpil.

357
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,502
- He's an easy prey.
- You must be easy to beat.

358
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:17,402
- There's no way I can beat you.
- Okay.

359
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,872
- Starting with your grip...
- His grip feels different.

360
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:20,649
- Wonpil is an easy one.
- His grip feels different.

361
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,113
Gosh, try to straighten up your arm.

362
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:23,943
Wonpil, bring it closer.

363
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,412
Bring it closer. That's it.

364
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:26,853
- Set, go.
- Hey.

365
00:12:27,953 --> 00:12:28,982
Darn it.

366
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,682
Wonpil is a cute one.

367
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,683
Darn it.

368
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,922
I'm supposed to be a testosterone boy.

369
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:35,622
(Laughing)

370
00:12:35,623 --> 00:12:36,623
What did you say?

371
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,623
- You're a testosterone boy?
- A testosterone boy?

372
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,969
- Yes.
- You're a testosterone boy?

373
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:40,392
- Gosh, testosterone...
- More like a cute guy.

374
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,762
Did you enjoy your meal?

375
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:42,763
- Yes.
- Yes.

376
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:43,862
Let's all sit together.

377
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:44,863
- Let's sit together.
- Okay.

378
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,832
- This is the last one.
- Isn't this the highlight?

379
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,732
(The highlight of today's trip)

380
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:49,742
- I can't wait.
- Now...

381
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:51,472
I'm sure you know about this.

382
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:52,973
The last activity of our trip is...

383
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:55,272
- an essential program of our show.
- The highlight.

384
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:57,113
- It's Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.
- Yes.

385
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,342
(Worried)

386
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:01,313
Let me sleep indoors at least.

387
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,223
- All right.
- Let's see.

388
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:05,383
- Everyone. Starting now...
- What?

389
00:13:07,393 --> 00:13:08,203
I want you to pair up.

390
00:13:08,313 --> 00:13:10,026
- Let's see.
- Everyone. Starting now...

391
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,196
What?

392
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:13,556
I want you to pair up.

393
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:15,365
- Gosh.
- How should we pair up?

394
00:13:15,366 --> 00:13:16,695
- That's it.
- Okay.

395
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,696
- My lucky break.
- Done.

396
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,536
- I'm already taken.
- He's my lucky break.

397
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,006
- I've been chosen.
- But DAY6...

398
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:23,435
- Should we split up?
- You should split up.

399
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:24,505
- We should split up? Okay.
- Yes.

400
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:25,805
Or DAY6 can pick their partner.

401
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,235
- That might be better.
- Let's go with that.

402
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:28,245
- That will be fun.
- Let's do that.

403
00:13:28,246 --> 00:13:29,246
- It will be neat.
- Okay. Let's do that.

404
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:32,115
The 2 members who aren't chosen by DAY6 will pair up.

405
00:13:32,116 --> 00:13:34,175
- Yes. Let them pick.
- Okay.

406
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:37,315
(But...)

407
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,715
(SungJin cracks up at something.)

408
00:13:39,716 --> 00:13:40,855
- Yes.
- He's not good at games.

409
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,786
- Then...
- All right.

410
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:44,685
(Shooting a crazed gaze at the lucky guy, Wonpil)

411
00:13:44,686 --> 00:13:46,126
We should all sit in the front.

412
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:48,942
- We have to pick our partner?
- Let's all sit in the front.

413
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:50,226
Right here.

414
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,736
- Someone keeps looking at me.
- Right.

415
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:55,736
Why do you keep looking at Wonpil?

416
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:59,175
(Secretly exchanging eye contact)

417
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:00,776
I don't want to sleep outdoors.

418
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:02,805
I can't stop feeling his gaze.

419
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:04,005
- I'm ready to play.
- Please remember...

420
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:06,376
the people who won all the games today.

421
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,115
It's about time we turn the tables around.

422
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:09,216
Who was the ace?

423
00:14:09,946 --> 00:14:11,246
We'll close our eyes.

424
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:14,386
Please hug your partner from behind.

425
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:17,955
Whom will DAY6 choose?

426
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,325
(Whom will DAY6 choose?)

427
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,825
- No one will want me, right?
- Right.

428
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,625
I'm feeling a lot of warmth from behind.

429
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:24,666
It's getting hot in here.

430
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:25,936
(Dowoon)

431
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:27,035
I can hear his breathing.

432
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:28,365
(Dowoon picks Jong Min.)

433
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:29,366
Okay.

434
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,735
- Three, - Go.

435
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,735
Two, one.

436
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:34,205
(Young K picks Se Yoon.)

437
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,276
All right.

438
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:37,905
You guys are done, right? Let's open our eyes. Go.

439
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:38,975
Open your eyes.

440
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:41,146
(Wonpil picks DinDin.)

441
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,145
- Gosh.
- Gosh!

442
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:45,185
(Seon Ho and Joon are left out.)

443
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,555
- SungJin.
- This is great.

444
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:48,485
- Why?
- You didn't even see them, right?

445
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:50,151
- I really don't get it.
- Let's end it on a good note.

446
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:51,244
(I kept glancing at you nonstop.)

447
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:52,674
Why did you pick Jong Min?

448
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:54,014
- Gosh.
- Even until the end...

449
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:55,345
- I showed you my talent!
- Gosh.

450
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:57,284
He kept giving me that look. I'm so sorry.

451
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:59,485
- I mean it.
- I thought you were a good guy.

452
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:00,755
(Laughing)

453
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:03,124
We were their least favorites from the opening.

454
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,054
Weren't they the last two left during the opening...

455
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:06,294
- as well?
- Right.

456
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:07,724
Hold on. Can I ask them at least?

457
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:10,094
I think I did pretty well with the games today.

458
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:12,195
- You were great today.
- Yes.

459
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:13,934
But you must've really wanted to win.

460
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:16,465
You kept looking at Wonpil before the selection.

461
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:18,074
- He's sly.
- Gosh.

462
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:19,234
- He's sly.
- I was hurt by that.

463
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:21,344
- I thought I took good care of him.
- I see.

464
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:22,974
- Everyone.
- Seriously.

465
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:24,204
Could you sit with your partner?

466
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:25,314
- Sit down.
- What?

467
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:26,315
Sit with your partner.

468
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:27,544
- Joon.
- What is this?

469
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:28,644
Is it you and me again?

470
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:29,884
- Their chemistry is so funny.
- All right.

471
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:30,885
Everyone.

472
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:32,661
- I'll end up sleeping outside.
- It's like...

473
00:15:32,685 --> 00:15:34,514
Are you trying to curse us with bad luck?

474
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:36,085
- I feel so demoralized.
- Why?

475
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:37,925
He must be losing it. Hey.

476
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:40,706
You know what? Your name is the only thing I know of you.

477
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:43,064
- It's been...
- He only knows Seon Ho's name.

478
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:44,094
- They're so childish.
- You know what?

479
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:45,095
- I'm curious...
- But...

480
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:47,094
- how many of us will sleep outside.
- Right.

481
00:15:47,095 --> 00:15:49,334
- We paired up.
- Two pairs might sleep outside.

482
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:50,664
- That's the feeling you get, right?
- Yes.

483
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:52,004
- Two pairs?
- I saw...

484
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:53,475
two tents pitched outside.

485
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:54,804
- Then it must be two pairs.
- There were tents outside.

486
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:58,045
Why did you already pitch the tents? That's negative thinking.

487
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,214
Is everyone sleeping indoors a possibility?

488
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:03,444
- Yes.
- Really?

489
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:04,445
Sometimes.

490
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:06,954
Since there are ten of us, it'd be fun to sleep together.

491
00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:08,554
- That must be fun.
- It'll feel like a school trip.

492
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:10,854
- We can gather around together.
- Right.

493
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:12,224
- It'll feel like a school trip.
- All right.

494
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:13,225
(Please.)

495
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:14,394
- What is it?
- What is it?

496
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:15,994
Who wants to go first?

497
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:17,795
- The leftovers must go first.
- Gosh.

498
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:19,934
- What?
- Let's go.

499
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,134
- I see. We'll go separately?
- We should go then.

500
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:22,534
- All right. You guys will go first.
- All separately?

501
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:23,905
What was your name? Ryu Seon Ho?

502
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:25,634
- Was your name Joon Lee?
- What was that?

503
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:26,735
"Joon Lee?"

504
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:29,604
- But that's his name.
- It's actually his name.

505
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:31,605
- It's the right name.
- They have good chemistry.

506
00:16:32,345 --> 00:16:34,115
Where are we going? Should we go outside?

507
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:35,445
Yes.

508
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:37,184
We go

509
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:39,054
- Outside - Outside

510
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:44,225
(They make the loudest appearance as they come out.)

511
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,455
You must sing it longer.

512
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:51,224
(They're stopped by the staff.)

513
00:16:51,225 --> 00:16:52,295
Okay.

514
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:56,205
Today's game for Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors is...

515
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,005
Read the Room and Pick a Room.

516
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:01,705
The winners will sleep in that building tonight.

517
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:05,375
The building comes with a two-person room...

518
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:07,675
and 2 4-person rooms.

519
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:09,515
There's a total of three rooms.

520
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:12,015
You can pick the room you want and go in.

521
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:13,714
You can pick separate rooms.

522
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:14,984
Or you can enter the same room together. That doesn't matter.

523
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:16,425
What happens if we go in separately?

524
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:17,624
However,

525
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,945
you can only sleep in your room if the number of people...

526
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:22,024
doesn't exceed the capacity.

527
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:23,624
(If it's under the capacity, they can sleep in the room.)

528
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,694
But those who end up in a room that exceeds the capacity...

529
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,464
will sleep outdoors.

530
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:29,705
- You understood that, right?
- I did.

531
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,734
So if you guys get lucky, you could all sleep inside.

532
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:34,004
(They can all sleep indoors if they're lucky.)

533
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:35,674
(But if they're unlucky, all of them could sleep outside.)

534
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:37,035
Then we all might end up outdoors.

535
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:40,674
Why must we think about this? We don't need to think about this.

536
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:43,215
We don't think about it, so we always sleep outdoors.

537
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:46,084
Right. Do you know what crossed my mind?

538
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:47,184
Do you just want to pick the two-person room?

539
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:48,705
Do you want to pick the room together?

540
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:50,484
Then our probability of winning will be so low.

541
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:52,724
That's how we enjoy this game. That's the essence of our show.

542
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:54,165
We ought to take things all the way.

543
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:56,165
When everyone thinks we're wrong,

544
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:57,624
we must go for it.

545
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,694
Then we'll end up sleeping indoors.

546
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:01,734
- Here's why I'm trying to stop you.
- Okay.

547
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:04,264
Listen. You don't think anyone will think like us.

548
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:05,734
- Right? That's possible.
- Yes.

549
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:06,904
- You're right about that.
- Okay.

550
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:09,844
But we can pick separate rooms.

551
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:11,204
"You go to the 4-person room, and I, the 2-person room."

552
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:12,214
- That's possible too.
- Yes.

553
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:13,821
Once it exceeds three people, it's over for us.

554
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:14,985
We don't have a chance.

555
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:16,645
- Are you that scared?
- I am.

556
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:18,984
- Why are you so scared?
- It's not about that.

557
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:20,914
If we lose, we sleep outdoors. That's what the show is about.

558
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:23,555
Must you walk the path when you know it's headed downhill?

559
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:25,824
- That's the fun part.
- How is that fun?

560
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:27,754
- I can see our future.
- We decided to play this game.

561
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:29,494
- So let's go big.
- I can see the result.

562
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:31,365
Why must we choose that path, knowing this?

563
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:33,495
- You have to pick now.
- Okay.

564
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:35,934
- We'll pick the two-person room.
- What? No.

565
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:37,135
- What?
- No way.

566
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:38,274
- What?
- Gosh.

567
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:39,404
- Let's go to the two-person room.
- I said no.

568
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:40,735
- Trust me on this.
- No.

569
00:18:40,835 --> 00:18:42,274
If I'm wrong, I'll give you ten dollars.

570
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:43,744
I have ten dollars too.

571
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:45,044
- Twenty dollars.
- I have that much money too.

572
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:47,045
Then 30 dollars. I can't go higher than that.

573
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:50,015
Hey, that's a lot of money for me.

574
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:52,685
Everyone will want to go to the four-person room.

575
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:54,014
He and I can't see eye to eye.

576
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:55,354
Joon, go to the four-person room with me.

577
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:57,035
- Let's go to the two-person room.
- Or...

578
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,755
By the way, both of them seemed...

579
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,394
- energetic today.
- Right.

580
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:03,395
They looked like a decent couple.

581
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:05,594
- They have chemistry.
- Their chemistry is great.

582
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:07,365
Seriously. The two of them...

583
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:09,475
How come everything is so secretive here?

584
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,934
- It has to be.
- They don't tell us anything.

585
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:13,605
I think that's why it's more fun.

586
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:15,405
That's good to hear.

587
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:18,374
I didn't know you were someone's role model.

588
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,445
He's the first one to say openly on TV...

589
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:22,345
- Really?
- that I'm his role model.

590
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:23,714
There were articles about that.

591
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:24,814
- Right.
- So a lot of people knew about it.

592
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:27,454
Actually, this is what it said in the news article.

593
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:30,324
"Dowoon Goes to Meet His Role Model, Kim Jong Min."

594
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:31,554
That was the headline.

595
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:32,694
("Watch the Show to Find Out")

596
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:34,494
But it seemed he was very disappointed today.

597
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:35,994
(Chuckling)

598
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:38,264
Dowoon didn't give up on Jong Min yet.

599
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:39,265
- Right.
- Of course not.

600
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:41,035
I hope we can end things on a good note.

601
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:43,305
- End things on a good note?
- This is the end?

602
00:19:44,105 --> 00:19:45,134
This is it?

603
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:46,974
Be good to him while you're with him.

604
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:48,655
You never know when you'll meet him again.

605
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:52,114
You know what? We do look alike when we laugh.

606
00:19:52,115 --> 00:19:53,144
- Right.
- Yes.

607
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:55,814
All right. Who will go next? Which pair will it be?

608
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:56,815
- Shall we?
- We can go in order.

609
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:58,984
- Can't we go?
- If you won't give us any clues,

610
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:00,385
- we'll just go.
- We'll go.

611
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:01,884
- What are we doing?
- Okay. Here we go.

612
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:02,984
- Why won't they come back?
- Let's go.

613
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,025
Let's go.

614
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:06,555
But those who end up in a room that exceeds the capacity...

615
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,024
will sleep outdoors.

616
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:09,465
- Everyone?
- One two-person room...

617
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:10,925
and 1 4-person room.

618
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:12,434
Considering the probability,

619
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:13,794
we should split up and pick the four-person room.

620
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,434
- That sounds the best, right?
- Yes, for now.

621
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,265
It sounds like the best.

622
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:20,305
If there are 3 people in the 2-person room,

623
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:22,544
and 7 people are in the 4-person room...

624
00:20:22,545 --> 00:20:24,404
- All of them will sleep outdoors.
- All of them?

625
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:26,575
- So that scenario is possible?
- Yes.

626
00:20:26,845 --> 00:20:30,244
I'd like to take a risk.

627
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:31,284
SungJin,

628
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:32,584
you should sleep comfortably tonight.

629
00:20:32,585 --> 00:20:33,954
I'm willing to take a risk...

630
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:35,885
and enter the two-person room.

631
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:37,985
Please make the choice.

632
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:40,595
What do I do?

633
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:42,425
How about this?

634
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:44,194
The four-person room?

635
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:46,165
(What will be SungJin's choice?)

636
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:48,095
- All right.
- What should we do?

637
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:50,634
Which two of you want to go next?

638
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:52,505
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

639
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:53,834
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

640
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,244
(They have the same posture and speed when standing up.)

641
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:56,575
- See you.
- We'll go.

642
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:58,314
- I'm leaving.
- Bye.

643
00:20:58,315 --> 00:20:59,745
Stay on track.

644
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:01,945
Why isn't anyone coming back?

645
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:03,385
It seems like...

646
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:04,385
There must be something.

647
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:05,715
Maybe we have to pick a room.

648
00:21:05,915 --> 00:21:06,915
What?

649
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,584
- That could be it.
- We did that a lot.

650
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:11,724
Yes. I saw two rooms over there.

651
00:21:11,725 --> 00:21:13,124
Here's something that we did before.

652
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,695
There was a room for four people.

653
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,695
Four of us were waiting in a room.

654
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:23,064
- Hoping that no one would come in?
- Yes.

655
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:24,545
We got scared when the room was full.

656
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:26,574
- This is so confusing.
- It's confusing.

657
00:21:26,575 --> 00:21:28,905
Gosh, someone keeps coming up with such brain teasers.

658
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,304
What do you think?

659
00:21:31,305 --> 00:21:32,774
I think it'd be better for us to split.

660
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:33,775
- Right?
- Yes.

661
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:36,044
In that case, we won't be sleeping together.

662
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,444
- Right.
- What?

663
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:38,554
- Right.
- Really?

664
00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:40,314
(What's wrong with that?)

665
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:42,054
(You don't care about me either...)

666
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:44,755
(as long as you sleep indoors?)

667
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,254
(You don't care either?)

668
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:49,564
(Me neither)

669
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:51,765
(Their brains are in sync.)

670
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:53,735
Shall we go to the two-person room?

671
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:55,134
- Both of us?
- Yes.

672
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:56,135
(Why don't we take a risk?)

673
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:57,635
(I knew that you'd be the same.)

674
00:21:57,935 --> 00:21:59,804
I don't think anyone would go in.

675
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:00,875
It's because...

676
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:02,645
One of us should go in.

677
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:05,275
- Just one of us?
- Do you want to go? Or shall I?

678
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:07,345
I'd like you to go.

679
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:10,915
My goodness.

680
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:12,714
Imagine sleeping outdoors right now.

681
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:14,355
We will die from the heat.

682
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:17,784
- We have to...
- Let's split this way.

683
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:19,354
- Instead of the two-person room?
- Yes.

684
00:22:19,355 --> 00:22:20,355
Since we're a team,

685
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:22,624
we're wishing each other good luck.

686
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:23,625
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.

687
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:25,165
We have to survive together.

688
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:28,504
You don't necessarily have to join me.

689
00:22:28,505 --> 00:22:29,565
It's not about that.

690
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:31,104
What's important is both of our happiness.

691
00:22:31,105 --> 00:22:32,574
I agree. Take care of yourself.

692
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:33,605
Okay.

693
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:35,444
Feel free to choose.

694
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:37,405
Go to that room. I'll go here.

695
00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:39,715
Let's go. Here I go.

696
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:41,545
- One.
- Two.

697
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,045
Three.

698
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:50,684
(SungJin is in the 4-person room on the right.)

699
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:51,685
Gosh.

700
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:54,925
Wait a minute. It's still okay in here.

701
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,894
(Screaming)

702
00:22:56,895 --> 00:22:58,025
What's this?

703
00:22:58,095 --> 00:22:59,794
(Sae Ho was under the bed.)

704
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,865
What's going on here?

705
00:23:02,235 --> 00:23:05,734
(3 minutes ago)

706
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:09,304
(SungJin was struggling with the idea of splitting.)

707
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,544
Even if we sleep outdoors,

708
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:12,251
shall we go into the four-person room together?

709
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:14,314
- Just like that? Nice and clean?
- Nice and clean.

710
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:15,384
Even if we sleep outdoors?

711
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:17,615
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

712
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:19,214
I feel like someone is in there.

713
00:23:19,215 --> 00:23:20,454
- Then let's go here.
- Yes.

714
00:23:20,455 --> 00:23:21,684
I have a feeling,

715
00:23:21,685 --> 00:23:22,755
but I could be wrong.

716
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,395
No one is here.

717
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:29,494
No one is here.

718
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:31,624
(Things were still good back then.)

719
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,635
We're saved.

720
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,071
If someone comes in, I'll grab his ankle from underneath.

721
00:23:35,095 --> 00:23:36,334
Shall I let it go?

722
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:37,735
- I'll let it go a little.
- Okay.

723
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:42,005
Wait a minute. It's still okay in here.

724
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:45,005
What's this?

725
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:48,144
- Sae Ho.
- I'm doomed.

726
00:23:48,145 --> 00:23:49,784
- Aren't you hot in there?
- I should get out.

727
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:50,785
Right.

728
00:23:51,685 --> 00:23:52,755
One.

729
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:54,354
Two. Three.

730
00:23:54,355 --> 00:23:55,355
(What about Jong Min?)

731
00:23:58,325 --> 00:23:59,424
Are you here alone?

732
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:01,655
Jong Min, it's not bad for now.

733
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:03,094
(Seon Ho is alone.)

734
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:04,695
Listen. There are two of us here.

735
00:24:05,295 --> 00:24:06,841
There are 3 people in the other 4-person room.

736
00:24:06,865 --> 00:24:08,635
Joon is the only 1 in the 2-person room.

737
00:24:09,805 --> 00:24:10,865
Okay.

738
00:24:11,435 --> 00:24:12,774
Should I sleep here in advance?

739
00:24:12,775 --> 00:24:14,134
(With a heart of a beast, Joon went into the 2-person room alone.)

740
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:15,205
This is nice.

741
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,105
We should be bold.

742
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:23,444
(Bold praying)

743
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:25,144
(Sae Ho, SungJin, Dowoon in the 4-person room)

744
00:24:25,145 --> 00:24:26,814
(Seon Ho, Jong Min in the 4-person room)

745
00:24:26,815 --> 00:24:31,054
(Joon in the 2-person room)

746
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:33,225
- They're making a comeback.
- We'll get going.

747
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:35,725
Just take your pillows.

748
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:36,895
Good luck.

749
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:38,695
Do we still have hope?

750
00:24:39,635 --> 00:24:41,294
- Be honest.
- Everyone has hope.

751
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:42,464
Does Young K have hope?

752
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:44,665
- Even a person like me?
- Yes.

753
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:46,411
Will there be a day when I get to smile...

754
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:48,034
- for no reason?
- A day like that.

755
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:50,505
(These lyrics are...)

756
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,574
(The lyrics in the intro of "HAPPY" by DAY6)

757
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,444
(Will there be such a day? A day when I feel good for no reason)

758
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:59,454
(The lyricist recites the lyrics of "HAPPY.")

759
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:01,315
Today might be that day.

760
00:25:02,025 --> 00:25:03,784
- Happy.
- Happy?

761
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:05,084
- I want to smile every day.
- Yes.

762
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:06,325
(I want to smile every day.)

763
00:25:06,595 --> 00:25:07,895
I'm breaking down.

764
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:09,995
I might cry.

765
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:12,135
So please.

766
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:14,694
You must have felt like this when you wrote them.

767
00:25:14,695 --> 00:25:16,064
It's pathetic to hear you read...

768
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:17,464
the lyrics out loud.

769
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:19,404
- Hey.
- This isn't a positive song.

770
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:20,474
Right.

771
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:21,944
This is a pathetic song.

772
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:25,075
It's pathetic to hear the lyrics read out loud.

773
00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:27,174
I want to smile every day. Please!

774
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:29,121
(Those who want to be happy every time they're on 2 Days 1 Night)

775
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:30,785
There must be two people in each room.

776
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:32,815
Then it's over.

777
00:25:32,985 --> 00:25:34,555
- If we split...
- If we split...

778
00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:36,655
In my opinion,

779
00:25:37,925 --> 00:25:40,554
SungJin probably suggested going in the same room.

780
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:42,524
I bet they stayed together.

781
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:44,364
I'm 100 percent certain that Jong Min split.

782
00:25:44,365 --> 00:25:45,834
"No, you go over there."

783
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,294
He probably said that.

784
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,705
(Correct)

785
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:52,174
What about Joon and Seon Ho who went first?

786
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,335
They split.

787
00:25:53,475 --> 00:25:54,955
I'm 100 percent sure that they split.

788
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:56,644
(Correct)

789
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:58,045
- They definitely split.
- Then...

790
00:25:58,275 --> 00:25:59,474
I bet Sae Ho agreed...

791
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,914
- and went with SungJin.
- Me too.

792
00:26:00,915 --> 00:26:02,391
(He should start a fortune-telling business.)

793
00:26:02,415 --> 00:26:03,944
Here's what we have to decide.

794
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:05,114
- Which room...
- Goodness.

795
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:07,255
Shall we split or go into the same room?

796
00:26:08,255 --> 00:26:10,525
Or you can go crazy and go into the two-person room.

797
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,794
I think it's better to...

798
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:15,924
- Stay together?
- Yes.

799
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:16,925
Okay.

800
00:26:17,465 --> 00:26:18,794
Then it can't be the two-person room.

801
00:26:18,795 --> 00:26:21,235
(This room is the only way to survive if they stay together.)

802
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:23,704
Since this is the safest choice,

803
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:25,204
many people probably went in there.

804
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:26,575
- Let's just go in.
- Okay.

805
00:26:26,975 --> 00:26:28,134
Wait.

806
00:26:28,135 --> 00:26:31,245
No one probably went into the two-person room, right?

807
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:33,715
Listen. If you think about it...

808
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:39,554
- Let's pick.
- Here?

809
00:26:39,555 --> 00:26:40,614
Let's go.

810
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:41,714
(Seon Ho, Jong Min in the 4-person room)

811
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:45,454
(Wonpil picked the 4-person room on the left.)

812
00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:46,954
- Everyone.
- We'll get going.

813
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:50,764
(The last players arrive at the place of destiny.)

814
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:51,894
It feels so cool in here.

815
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:53,895
(The last players arrive at the place of destiny.)

816
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:55,705
Shall we split?

817
00:26:56,505 --> 00:26:57,704
- We should stay together.
- Be responsible for our own...

818
00:26:57,705 --> 00:26:59,404
We should stay together. No team split up.

819
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:01,211
It will definitely be our loss if we split up.

820
00:27:01,235 --> 00:27:02,244
No.

821
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,245
(Many teams have split.)

822
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,515
One of us can survive.

823
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:07,615
You want one of us to survive?

824
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:09,414
If I sleep with you, I'll snore a lot.

825
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:10,415
Okay?

826
00:27:11,385 --> 00:27:12,454
That's true.

827
00:27:12,455 --> 00:27:13,654
Let me show you how I snore.

828
00:27:13,655 --> 00:27:15,055
(He's demonstrating.)

829
00:27:15,655 --> 00:27:17,484
(Snoring)

830
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:18,655
(Snoring)

831
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:22,164
(Snoring)

832
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:23,824
Isn't that the sound of a monster?

833
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:25,345
Do you want to take care of me or not?

834
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:26,534
Here we go.

835
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:28,364
Here we go. Let's sleep together.

836
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:29,935
(4-person room)

837
00:27:30,405 --> 00:27:32,304
(Heading to the 4-person room on the left?)

838
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:33,334
Tell them before going in.

839
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:34,474
I'm coming in.

840
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:36,644
(I'm coming in.)

841
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:37,944
(4-person room)

842
00:27:37,945 --> 00:27:39,045
I'm coming in.

843
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:41,344
How are they so quiet?

844
00:27:41,345 --> 00:27:42,915
They have such good teamwork.

845
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:44,314
You said that you've been unlucky.

846
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:45,385
Let's change that.

847
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:46,884
It's up to you.

848
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:48,684
Should I follow you or not? Should we split?

849
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:49,961
(What will be Young K's choice?)

850
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:51,685
Please. I hope no one is in here.

851
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:54,895
- Goodness!
- Gosh!

852
00:27:55,565 --> 00:27:58,694
(4-person room)

853
00:27:58,695 --> 00:27:59,764
No way.

854
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:01,194
- Goodness.
- What?

855
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:02,865
- Oh, my.
- Wait a minute.

856
00:28:03,805 --> 00:28:06,005
(3 minutes ago)

857
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:09,504
(He picked the 4-person room on the left.)

858
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:11,104
No, I won't go in here.

859
00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:13,144
- I got a feeling. This isn't it.
- Okay.

860
00:28:13,145 --> 00:28:14,914
- That's the wrong place.
- Okay.

861
00:28:14,915 --> 00:28:16,015
Instead of that room...

862
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:19,815
(He picked the 4-person room on the right.)

863
00:28:22,925 --> 00:28:24,854
(We're doomed.)

864
00:28:24,855 --> 00:28:26,025
You came in here?

865
00:28:26,325 --> 00:28:27,354
(The 4-person room on the right)

866
00:28:27,355 --> 00:28:28,764
Why didn't you go to the two-person room?

867
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:30,994
I expected you to go to the two-person room.

868
00:28:30,995 --> 00:28:32,464
I thought that you'd be in the two-person room.

869
00:28:32,465 --> 00:28:34,235
- This is insane.
- You came here?

870
00:28:34,335 --> 00:28:35,364
What about you, Sae Ho?

871
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,364
No, as I said...

872
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:38,534
Where did Jong Min go?

873
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:40,134
They're probably similar to us.

874
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,274
- The other room?
- Yes.

875
00:28:41,275 --> 00:28:42,305
Goodness!

876
00:28:42,745 --> 00:28:45,345
(They didn't come in here!)

877
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:47,074
It's over.

878
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:48,475
- It's confirmed.
- It's confirmed.

879
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:49,714
It's confirmed.

880
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:51,684
- Yes.
- Confirmed.

881
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:53,014
- It's confirmed.
- It's confirmed.

882
00:28:53,015 --> 00:28:54,184
I'm glad that I sent Dowoon.

883
00:28:54,185 --> 00:28:56,125
(Laughing)

884
00:28:56,685 --> 00:29:00,925
(Joon, the only 1 who picked the 2-person room)

885
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,465
What?

886
00:29:04,565 --> 00:29:05,594
(He gets to sleep indoors.)

887
00:29:05,595 --> 00:29:06,635
What?

888
00:29:07,235 --> 00:29:08,535
They're such fools.

889
00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:10,104
- Right.
- Are there seven of us?

890
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:11,835
- Yes.
- Who got split?

891
00:29:12,135 --> 00:29:13,205
Jong Min and...

892
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:14,704
- Dowoon.
- Dowoon.

893
00:29:14,705 --> 00:29:16,574
Everyone except us will sleep indoors.

894
00:29:16,575 --> 00:29:18,005
- Right.
- You're right.

895
00:29:18,245 --> 00:29:19,574
All DAY6 members are here.

896
00:29:19,575 --> 00:29:21,245
- Exactly.
- This is good enough.

897
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:23,545
Everyone, please come out.

898
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:25,855
This is the tenth anniversary.

899
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:27,855
This is what a team is about.

900
00:29:28,115 --> 00:29:29,124
(Team members meet again after surviving.)

901
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,084
- This is teamwork.
- This is what a team is about.

902
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:32,725
There was someone in the two-person room.

903
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:34,155
That was close.

904
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:35,965
Only you went in here.

905
00:29:36,495 --> 00:29:37,694
- Well done.
- He'll sleep indoors.

906
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:38,764
(The heart of a beast, Joon)

907
00:29:38,765 --> 00:29:39,864
Seriously?

908
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,364
- Jong Min.
- They both survived.

909
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:43,085
- Why you...
- Jong Min's reputation got...

910
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:44,934
- Is Jong Min okay?
- damaged.

911
00:29:44,935 --> 00:29:46,735
(Jealous)

912
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,044
Sleeping outdoors is a must since we're on 2 Days 1 Night.

913
00:29:49,045 --> 00:29:50,144
Oh, my.

914
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:52,104
- It's a must.
- You're so positive.

915
00:29:52,105 --> 00:29:53,821
- I love his positive mindset.
- Of course.

916
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:54,914
Let's be friends.

917
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:56,584
We're the only team that survived.

918
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:58,684
- Yes, we should be friends.
- I'll listen to you from now on.

919
00:29:58,685 --> 00:30:00,684
Now...

920
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:02,254
Only these three will sleep indoors?

921
00:30:02,255 --> 00:30:03,684
Joon, Seon Ho, and Jong Min.

922
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:05,454
- It's us three only.
- They will sleep indoors.

923
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:06,525
And...

924
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:08,594
Sae Ho, Se Yoon, DinDin,

925
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:10,564
SungJin, Young K, Wonpil, and Dowoon.

926
00:30:10,565 --> 00:30:12,064
- There are so many.
- They will...

927
00:30:12,065 --> 00:30:13,194
Will it be okay?

928
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:14,494
- This is...
- You will...

929
00:30:14,495 --> 00:30:16,064
sleep outdoors.

930
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,105
Is this possible?

931
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:19,435
Is there enough space for us?

932
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:20,875
- Space?
- Yes.

933
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:23,405
There is enough space for all of you.

934
00:30:23,675 --> 00:30:26,615
There's another itinerary for tomorrow.

935
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:29,885
When you hear the wake-up song tomorrow morning,

936
00:30:30,285 --> 00:30:32,044
please come out to the field.

937
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:33,354
- Do you mean the lawn?
- Yes.

938
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:34,384
Is that it?

939
00:30:34,385 --> 00:30:35,831
- For your reference...
- Won't we be sleeping there?

940
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:37,154
Please. I hope it's not that.

941
00:30:37,155 --> 00:30:38,901
The earlier you show up, the more advantageous it is.

942
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:40,354
Anyway, for us...

943
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:42,725
- Go and get ready for bed.
- Let's sleep.

944
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:44,864
- Have a comfortable night.
- Okay.

945
00:30:44,865 --> 00:30:46,894
- Let's go.
- Good night.

946
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:48,094
Sleep well.

947
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:49,165
I'll give it to you.

948
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:52,104
- I can't believe it.
- I'm amazed.

949
00:30:52,105 --> 00:30:54,974
With so many people, I don't feel lonely.

950
00:30:54,975 --> 00:30:56,274
Of course. It will be fun. Don't worry.

951
00:30:56,275 --> 00:30:58,375
- DAY6's teamwork is unbelievable.
- Right.

952
00:30:59,575 --> 00:31:00,814
This is great.

953
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,045
(It's finally time to sleep.)

954
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:05,115
I can't believe what happened to me.

955
00:31:05,685 --> 00:31:06,785
Like they say,

956
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:09,135
when you keep doing it, it works out in the end.

957
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:10,824
(Joon knows how to have fun alone.)

958
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:12,395
Is that a camera? I can't see it.

959
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:14,395
It must be a camera.

960
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:18,694
(Jong Min and Seon Ho share a room together.)

961
00:31:18,695 --> 00:31:20,935
- This is nice.
- I'm a little bothered.

962
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:22,465
- By what?
- What?

963
00:31:22,565 --> 00:31:23,764
I'm worried about Dowoon.

964
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:25,064
(Dowoon is on Jong Min's mind.)

965
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:27,675
He should've slept indoors with me.

966
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:29,604
Splitting increases...

967
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:32,675
- the probability of success.
- Definitely.

968
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,145
Being loyal is good too,

969
00:31:35,615 --> 00:31:37,784
- but both of us being happy...
- Otherwise, everyone is doomed.

970
00:31:37,785 --> 00:31:38,815
Exactly.

971
00:31:39,115 --> 00:31:41,984
- To increase the probability...
- You made that choice...

972
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:44,024
in order to save one of you.

973
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:45,705
- But...
- The problem is that it was you.

974
00:31:46,355 --> 00:31:47,495
It's not a problem.

975
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:50,325
(I wonder what Dowoon is up to.)

976
00:31:50,695 --> 00:31:51,864
We have three tents.

977
00:31:51,865 --> 00:31:53,134
- Dowoon, pick 1.
- Dowoon, pick 1.

978
00:31:53,135 --> 00:31:54,565
Choose the tent you want to go in.

979
00:31:55,065 --> 00:31:56,105
This is nice.

980
00:31:56,235 --> 00:31:58,035
- It's cool inside.
- I'm sorry.

981
00:31:58,135 --> 00:31:59,474
This is romantic.

982
00:31:59,475 --> 00:32:01,704
- It feels cool inside.
- It's okay.

983
00:32:01,705 --> 00:32:02,744
It's actually nice.

984
00:32:02,745 --> 00:32:03,944
- Isn't it okay?
- Yes.

985
00:32:03,945 --> 00:32:05,344
- This is good enough.
- It's nice.

986
00:32:05,345 --> 00:32:06,414
It's somewhat romantic.

987
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:07,475
- Right?
- Yes.

988
00:32:07,545 --> 00:32:08,815
I can't believe it.

989
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:10,784
- Sleeping like this?
- Yes.

990
00:32:10,785 --> 00:32:12,914
- With you...
- Sleeping outdoors like this?

991
00:32:12,915 --> 00:32:14,755
(A strange yet special sleep out on the grass)

992
00:32:15,085 --> 00:32:17,084
- This feels strange.
- I agree.

993
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:18,354
This will be memorable.

994
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:19,724
Isn't this more like a mosquito net...

995
00:32:19,725 --> 00:32:20,894
than a tent?

996
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:22,724
It's a mosquito net for outdoors.

997
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:24,195
Isn't there dew already?

998
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:27,265
It's not so bad today.

999
00:32:27,765 --> 00:32:30,634
Isn't it like sleeping at your grandma's house in the countryside?

1000
00:32:30,635 --> 00:32:31,705
Seriously.

1001
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:35,434
All of us are sleeping with each other's partner...

1002
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:36,805
except Dowoon.

1003
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:38,274
Where's Dowoon?

1004
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:40,215
- Where is Dowoon sleeping?
- Over there...

1005
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,074
He joined the team over there.

1006
00:32:42,075 --> 00:32:43,444
(He settled in like it was always the three of them.)

1007
00:32:43,445 --> 00:32:45,214
- Dowoon.
- Yes?

1008
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:47,214
Is Jong Min still your role model?

1009
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,285
I think I've had enough.

1010
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:53,854
- It's over as of today.
- He seems very selfish.

1011
00:32:53,855 --> 00:32:55,801
(He's questioning if Jong Min is still his role model.)

1012
00:32:55,825 --> 00:32:57,094
(Everyone bursts out laughing.)

1013
00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:58,195
He found out the truth.

1014
00:32:58,995 --> 00:33:00,164
That's satisfying to hear.

1015
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:01,635
The way he's talking is so funny.

1016
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:03,805
I can see the stars up there.

1017
00:33:05,465 --> 00:33:06,875
We'll see so many stars tonight.

1018
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:09,004
I see stars in the sky.

1019
00:33:09,005 --> 00:33:11,004
(While they were chatting, the sky got filled with stars.)

1020
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:12,205
How was it?

1021
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,744
- Do you mean today?
- Yes.

1022
00:33:13,745 --> 00:33:14,815
It was amazing.

1023
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:18,484
I've wanted to meet many of you.

1024
00:33:18,485 --> 00:33:19,991
(A honest conversation between partners)

1025
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:22,015
- I feel grateful.
- Seriously.

1026
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:26,395
There was a good vibe among us today.

1027
00:33:26,695 --> 00:33:28,394
- Really?
- Yes, strangely so.

1028
00:33:28,395 --> 00:33:31,724
(Throughout the day, they felt great synergy with each other.)

1029
00:33:31,725 --> 00:33:34,195
I don't know much,

1030
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:36,225
but you guys will last for a long time.

1031
00:33:36,835 --> 00:33:37,835
(His honest words as their senior and fan)

1032
00:33:37,836 --> 00:33:39,975
Your band will last for a long time.

1033
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:42,704
- I hope so.
- Yes, for a long time.

1034
00:33:42,705 --> 00:33:43,705
Right.

1035
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:45,704
I hope that we last a long time in a healthy way.

1036
00:33:45,705 --> 00:33:46,985
- In a healthy way.
- Seriously.

1037
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:48,814
Seriously, you'll last for a long time.

1038
00:33:48,815 --> 00:33:51,915
(Sae Ho encourages his juniors quietly.)

1039
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:56,055
(Soon, it's time to sleep.)

1040
00:33:56,755 --> 00:33:57,955
(Yawning)

1041
00:33:59,295 --> 00:34:00,355
(Yawning)

1042
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:03,525
Sleep well, Dowoon and SungJin.

1043
00:34:03,695 --> 00:34:04,865
Good night.

1044
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:06,594
Sleep well, neighbors.

1045
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:07,634
(Good night, everyone.)

1046
00:34:07,635 --> 00:34:09,964
- Sleep well.
- Good night.

1047
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,005
Good night.

1048
00:34:13,435 --> 00:34:15,634
(While everyone is sleeping, )

1049
00:34:15,635 --> 00:34:18,345
(the blue light covers the sky.)

1050
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:21,975
(What will be today's wake-up song to start the day cheerfully?)

1051
00:34:23,415 --> 00:34:27,055
("Dream Bus," a new song by DAY6 aired for the 1st time)

1052
00:34:41,435 --> 00:34:44,705
(Sae Ho reacts immediately to the wake-up song.)

1053
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:50,045
(They understand what's going on right away.)

1054
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:54,145
(After throwing on their shoes carelessly)

1055
00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:57,685
(In a full sprint)

1056
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:01,285
(Braking suddenly)

1057
00:35:02,755 --> 00:35:05,524
(Dowoon and Sae Ho arrive 1st and 2nd.)

1058
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:09,265
(Half-asleep)

1059
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,094
(Proofs 1 and 2 of a good night's sleep)

1060
00:35:12,095 --> 00:35:13,995
(Fluffy Dog Dowoon had a sound sleep.)

1061
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:17,505
(On the other hand, )

1062
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:22,335
(Young K is still lost in his dreams.)

1063
00:35:23,775 --> 00:35:28,845
(Meanwhile, SungJin comes out quietly.)

1064
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:34,415
(Gosh, who is this?)

1065
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:37,384
(Hurry up!)

1066
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,695
(At that moment!)

1067
00:35:40,395 --> 00:35:42,695
(Joon 3rd, SungJin 4th)

1068
00:35:46,665 --> 00:35:49,834
(As soon as he gets up, a concert starts.)

1069
00:35:49,835 --> 00:35:52,735
(You don't have time for this.)

1070
00:35:54,575 --> 00:35:57,605
(Getting up)

1071
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:03,045
(Everyone, including Wonpil, gets up.)

1072
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:09,255
(Did you sleep well?)

1073
00:36:09,525 --> 00:36:10,585
Did you sleep well?

1074
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:11,955
Good morning.

1075
00:36:12,955 --> 00:36:15,154
- Wasn't it hot?
- I slept so well.

1076
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:16,464
(The traces are still there.)

1077
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,195
- What a great morning.
- I slept so well.

1078
00:36:19,565 --> 00:36:22,034
For today's morning mission, the food truck will be at stake,

1079
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:24,004
the essence of 2 Days 1 Night.

1080
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:25,005
(Today's breakfast, food truck)

1081
00:36:25,006 --> 00:36:26,775
- The food truck is good.
- It's delicious.

1082
00:36:28,635 --> 00:36:32,714
(Including the crunchiest pork cutlet)

1083
00:36:32,715 --> 00:36:34,395
(Potato croquette, kkakdugi, salad, apple)

1084
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:38,114
(Today's menu that makes your mouth water)

1085
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,485
It's Shoot Menu.

1086
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,354
If you pop a balloon that has a side dish written on it...

1087
00:36:42,355 --> 00:36:43,554
with a dart,

1088
00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:45,754
you'll get to eat that side dish.

1089
00:36:45,755 --> 00:36:47,554
(Win side dishes by popping balloons with a dart)

1090
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:49,794
- You only get one chance.
- What?

1091
00:36:49,795 --> 00:36:51,365
You'll get only one dart.

1092
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:52,764
- Just once?
- Yes.

1093
00:36:52,765 --> 00:36:53,864
(Worried)

1094
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:56,504
You arrived on a 1st-come, 1st-served basis.

1095
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,805
Do we get to throw it from here?

1096
00:36:58,135 --> 00:36:59,774
Yes, from where you're standing.

1097
00:36:59,775 --> 00:37:00,905
What?

1098
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:02,874
- It's perfect for Dowoon.
- Right.

1099
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:04,475
- You're right.
- Gosh.

1100
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:07,415
- We have an advantage.
- This is insane.

1101
00:37:07,745 --> 00:37:09,414
- What?
- Right.

1102
00:37:09,415 --> 00:37:12,444
(What? From here?)

1103
00:37:12,445 --> 00:37:15,554
Throw it from the line that's on Dowoon's right.

1104
00:37:15,555 --> 00:37:16,984
- Right here?
- This is amazing.

1105
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,124
- It's amazing for Dowoon.
- This is far.

1106
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,294
It's very close.

1107
00:37:19,295 --> 00:37:20,554
(He's close enough to almost touch them.)

1108
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:22,054
- A full set?
- Of course.

1109
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:23,064
(There are a few full sets.)

1110
00:37:23,065 --> 00:37:25,024
He should go after the full set like a man.

1111
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:26,395
Let's go after the full set.

1112
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,164
- Go after the one at the edge.
- Right.

1113
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:29,725
- Take the one at the edge.
- This one?

1114
00:37:29,935 --> 00:37:31,735
- It'd be great if you took it.
- Right.

1115
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:33,374
If you do it...

1116
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,604
(Dowoon's target)

1117
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:36,304
Lean a little closer.

1118
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:37,345
Leave it up to me.

1119
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:39,714
Leave it up to me.

1120
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,474
(Sassy Dowoon)

1121
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:42,574
He's a hero with a damaged reputation.

1122
00:37:42,575 --> 00:37:43,614
(Referring to Jong Min)

1123
00:37:43,615 --> 00:37:45,484
Here I go. Should I throw it higher?

1124
00:37:45,485 --> 00:37:47,014
It's completely different from the drumsticks.

1125
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,384
- It's different.
- Pick what your heart tells you.

1126
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:49,455
You only get one chance.

1127
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:53,655
- What?
- Darn it.

1128
00:37:53,846 --> 00:37:54,393
It's completely different.

1129
00:37:54,394 --> 00:37:55,662
- It's different.
- Pick what your heart tells you.

1130
00:37:55,663 --> 00:37:56,693
You only get one chance.

1131
00:37:58,995 --> 00:38:00,555
- What?
- Darn it.

1132
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:03,064
(Everyone...)

1133
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:05,294
(covers their mouth.)

1134
00:38:05,295 --> 00:38:07,295
(Dowoon was after the full set.)

1135
00:38:08,265 --> 00:38:09,735
- What?
- Darn it.

1136
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:14,474
(He only obtained kkakdugi.)

1137
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:15,975
I can't believe that he got kkakdugi.

1138
00:38:16,305 --> 00:38:17,675
Nice.

1139
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:19,245
My goodness!

1140
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:22,945
Nice going, Dowoon.

1141
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:24,285
- Hey.
- That's unbelievable.

1142
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:25,615
He missed his chance.

1143
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:27,154
Yesterday, Dowoon...

1144
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:29,325
Yesterday, he won kimchi. Today, he won kkakdugi.

1145
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:32,995
Yesterday, it was kimchi. I'm kkakdugi

1146
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,464
- My goodness.
- Which one?

1147
00:38:35,465 --> 00:38:36,565
My goodness.

1148
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:38,534
His love for kimchi is impressive.

1149
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:39,564
I'm next.

1150
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:42,135
- His love for kimchi.
- I'll go for this full set.

1151
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:43,364
Okay.

1152
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:45,235
- Which one will you...
- Please pick.

1153
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:47,304
What?

1154
00:38:47,305 --> 00:38:49,244
(Sae Ho popped 2 balloons.)

1155
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:50,774
He popped two.

1156
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:51,775
Isn't it the same?

1157
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:53,075
- We'll give it to you.
- Okay.

1158
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:54,784
- I got it.
- He gets that?

1159
00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:55,785
How is this possible?

1160
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:56,785
(Those in the back are starting to get worried.)

1161
00:38:56,786 --> 00:38:58,314
- What's going on?
- Two at once?

1162
00:38:58,315 --> 00:39:00,055
- Go for the full set.
- The full set.

1163
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:01,985
- Pop.
- What?

1164
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:03,884
- Fried eggs.
- That's it.

1165
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:06,224
- We still have a chance.
- It's not bad.

1166
00:39:06,225 --> 00:39:07,624
You got one more than yesterday.

1167
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:08,625
(It's not bad.)

1168
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:09,964
- Which one are you going after?
- Good luck.

1169
00:39:09,965 --> 00:39:11,364
I'm going after the full set up there.

1170
00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:12,534
- The full set on top?
- The one in the top row.

1171
00:39:12,535 --> 00:39:13,964
I'm going after the full set up there.

1172
00:39:13,965 --> 00:39:15,104
- The full set on top?
- The one in the top row.

1173
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:16,664
- I bet it'll fly over the board.
- Hey, SungJin.

1174
00:39:16,665 --> 00:39:17,665
It'll fly over the board.

1175
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:18,704
(Se Yoon tries to disturb him to save at least one of them.)

1176
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:20,274
- I bet it'll fly over the board.
- Hey, SungJin.

1177
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,344
(He threw the dart right away!)

1178
00:39:23,345 --> 00:39:25,014
- I bet it'll fly over the board.
- Hey, SungJin.

1179
00:39:25,015 --> 00:39:26,015
It'll fly over the board.

1180
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:29,014
- What did he get?
- He got croquettes. What a shame.

1181
00:39:29,015 --> 00:39:30,344
- It didn't pop.
- My gosh.

1182
00:39:30,345 --> 00:39:31,384
That's weird.

1183
00:39:31,385 --> 00:39:32,754
(He's simply jealous.)

1184
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:34,485
We have many full sets left.

1185
00:39:35,425 --> 00:39:36,625
Can I get my hopes up?

1186
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:39,424
- Our turns will come after all.
- It's quite fun.

1187
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:40,425
- Seriously.
- What do we do?

1188
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:41,425
(It's the fifth member's turn. The board is quite far from him.)

1189
00:39:41,426 --> 00:39:42,724
- I'm sorry.
- It's quite fun.

1190
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:44,795
(Nervous)

1191
00:39:45,735 --> 00:39:47,734
(The fifth member, Young K, throws the dart.)

1192
00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:48,895
- Nice.
- He got dried laver.

1193
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:50,604
- It curved too much.
- What?

1194
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,105
(He hit it right in the middle!)

1195
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:54,504
(Young K obtained kkakdugi and dried laver.)

1196
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:55,785
He got kkakdugi and dried laver.

1197
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:57,665
He got dried laver on top of kkakdugi.

1198
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,585
You didn't get dried laver, did you?

1199
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:01,485
He got only kkakdugi.

1200
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:03,945
What should I do? Gosh.

1201
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,384
I don't think you can hit the target you're aiming for anyway.

1202
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:08,301
- Just throw it.
- No. I'm good at throwing darts.

1203
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:09,455
- Really?
- Yes.

1204
00:40:09,655 --> 00:40:11,975
- I'll begin. Here I go.
- Okay. It'll fly over the board.

1205
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:13,294
I hope he gets kkakdugi. Let's go.

1206
00:40:13,295 --> 00:40:14,925
(What could be Jong Min's breakfast?)

1207
00:40:15,265 --> 00:40:16,794
- Really?
- He got sausages.

1208
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:17,894
- Sausages.
- He got sausages.

1209
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:19,364
Jong Min obtained sausages.

1210
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:20,734
A tiger doesn't eat grass.

1211
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:22,615
I'm going to aim for a full set. Let's do this.

1212
00:40:22,765 --> 00:40:23,835
Here I go.

1213
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:25,974
I'm going to aim for the full set.

1214
00:40:25,975 --> 00:40:27,734
(Excited to see how he does)

1215
00:40:27,735 --> 00:40:28,745
All right.

1216
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:34,915
(Quiet)

1217
00:40:37,015 --> 00:40:38,185
Where did it go?

1218
00:40:40,085 --> 00:40:41,854
- Where did it go?
- Enjoy eating grass.

1219
00:40:41,855 --> 00:40:44,215
- There was no sound at all.
- It fell right on the ground.

1220
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:47,195
- It fell right on the ground.
- You got a full set of grass.

1221
00:40:50,025 --> 00:40:54,364
(Se Yoon got no food.)

1222
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:56,664
- It fell right on the ground.
- Oh, no.

1223
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:57,805
No.

1224
00:40:57,965 --> 00:41:00,935
- How did that happen?
- Enjoy eating grass.

1225
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:03,004
- Like a cow.
- My gosh. Seriously.

1226
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:04,174
(He tears up in shock as he got no food.)

1227
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:06,414
I will aim for a full set no matter what.

1228
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:07,874
(Seon Ho is a tough guy.)

1229
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:10,115
- He's a former athlete.
- Right. He's a former athlete.

1230
00:41:12,715 --> 00:41:14,715
(This is the former athlete's amazing accuracy.)

1231
00:41:15,155 --> 00:41:16,824
(Impressed)

1232
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:19,324
- Nice.
- He's really good at this.

1233
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:20,794
(Seon Ho obtained a full set.)

1234
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:21,795
- He got a full set.
- That's amazing.

1235
00:41:21,796 --> 00:41:23,694
There are still many balloons left in the leftmost column.

1236
00:41:23,695 --> 00:41:25,811
So I'll aim for any one of those except for the bottom one.

1237
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:27,275
So that I can eat at least one dish.

1238
00:41:27,895 --> 00:41:29,734
Se Yoon's dart fell on the ground,

1239
00:41:29,735 --> 00:41:31,505
so I'll throw it from up here. I'll start.

1240
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:36,144
- He got pork cutlet.
- That's not bad.

1241
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:38,045
The kid got pork cutlet as expected.

1242
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:39,615
Kids like pork cutlets.

1243
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:41,635
You have to throw it higher than you think.

1244
00:41:41,815 --> 00:41:42,884
This time...

1245
00:41:42,885 --> 00:41:44,784
- Wonpil, anything would be fine.
- Throw it hard. You know, right?

1246
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:45,814
(From this distance, it'll count even if it only touches a balloon.)

1247
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:47,855
- I think I can do this.
- I think he'll do well.

1248
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:50,725
- Hey, you're stepping on the line.
- You're stepping on the line.

1249
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:52,924
- Hey, you're stepping on the line.
- You're stepping on the line.

1250
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:55,224
(He chuckles out of embarrassment.)

1251
00:41:55,225 --> 00:41:56,225
- I think I can do this.
- Throw it hard.

1252
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:57,601
- Are you sure you can do this?
- Yes.

1253
00:41:57,625 --> 00:42:00,145
- Do you think you'll fail?
- No, I really think I can do this.

1254
00:42:00,635 --> 00:42:03,305
(He threw the dart without hesitating.)

1255
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:06,274
(Will it really fly that far?)

1256
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:07,635
No, I really think I can do this.

1257
00:42:09,075 --> 00:42:10,174
(Popping)

1258
00:42:10,175 --> 00:42:11,445
- Okay.
- He got a croquette.

1259
00:42:12,475 --> 00:42:15,915
(The dart flew in a perfect curve.)

1260
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,654
(Wonpil obtained a croquette.)

1261
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:20,784
- He did a good job.
- That's not bad.

1262
00:42:20,785 --> 00:42:22,454
Dowoon woke up earlier than everyone else...

1263
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:23,485
just to get kkakdugi?

1264
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,194
That's unbelievable.

1265
00:42:25,195 --> 00:42:26,571
(Kkakdugi is the privilege of the 1st place?)

1266
00:42:26,595 --> 00:42:28,424
- That's just unbelievable.
- Indeed.

1267
00:42:28,425 --> 00:42:30,164
- That was fun.
- Indeed.

1268
00:42:30,165 --> 00:42:32,395
(The morning mission ended with Dowoon feeling sad.)

1269
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:34,095
Hello.

1270
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:35,964
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

1271
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:38,334
(The food truck has arrived.)

1272
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:39,704
(Fried eggs and cocktail sausages, stir-fried spicy pork)

1273
00:42:39,705 --> 00:42:41,181
(Potato croquette, kkakdugi, salad, apple)

1274
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:42,405
The sausages look good.

1275
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:44,044
I see stir-fried spicy pork.

1276
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:45,551
(Today's dishes make your mouth water.)

1277
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:48,715
- Please give me only pork cutlet.
- Pork cutlet is so delicious.

1278
00:42:50,115 --> 00:42:54,285
(Extra crispy)

1279
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:56,285
- It looks so crispy.
- Oh, my.

1280
00:42:57,055 --> 00:42:58,554
- Please give me one more.
- Okay.

1281
00:42:58,555 --> 00:42:59,595
Sae Ho.

1282
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:01,724
- Did you get a full set?
- Yes, I got a full set.

1283
00:43:01,725 --> 00:43:03,524
(He has plenty of food. This is the privilege of a full set winner.)

1284
00:43:03,525 --> 00:43:04,765
There's no space for rice.

1285
00:43:05,195 --> 00:43:06,195
(Hold on.)

1286
00:43:06,196 --> 00:43:07,295
I can have rice, right?

1287
00:43:08,565 --> 00:43:10,264
So we all can have rice?

1288
00:43:10,265 --> 00:43:11,634
(Everyone gets rice regardless of the game results.)

1289
00:43:11,635 --> 00:43:13,204
I can make chungmu gimbap. Nice.

1290
00:43:13,205 --> 00:43:15,874
(Young K has a lot of dried laver on his plate.)

1291
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:16,974
You should take a lot of kkakdugi.

1292
00:43:16,975 --> 00:43:18,974
- You can take as much as you want.
- So that you can exchange.

1293
00:43:18,975 --> 00:43:20,174
- Can we exchange our food?
- Scoop a lot.

1294
00:43:20,175 --> 00:43:21,551
Since I don't have any, take as much as you want.

1295
00:43:21,575 --> 00:43:24,285
(Dowoon can have only kkakdugi.)

1296
00:43:24,815 --> 00:43:26,775
Sausages will be too greasy without another dish.

1297
00:43:27,055 --> 00:43:29,354
- Would you like to exchange?
- Yes, I'd love to.

1298
00:43:29,355 --> 00:43:30,675
Let's ask them if that's allowed.

1299
00:43:30,755 --> 00:43:32,131
- Can we exchange our food?
- Is that allowed?

1300
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:34,154
Each of you can exchange one dish for another.

1301
00:43:34,155 --> 00:43:35,995
Or else, you could have many different dishes.

1302
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:38,364
- Just 1 dish?
- Exchange it with 1 dish.

1303
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,141
You're allowed to exchange your food for one dish.

1304
00:43:40,165 --> 00:43:41,834
- Would you like some dried laver?
- That'd be great.

1305
00:43:41,835 --> 00:43:43,681
- Three pieces of pork cutlet.
- It looks so good.

1306
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,304
I'll give you 3 pieces of pork cutlet for 1 packet of dried laver.

1307
00:43:45,305 --> 00:43:46,934
- No.
- Then one sheet?

1308
00:43:46,935 --> 00:43:48,455
- Yes.
- For one sheet of dried laver,

1309
00:43:48,645 --> 00:43:50,244
I can give you this much.

1310
00:43:50,245 --> 00:43:51,245
(They'll exchange 1 sheet of dried laver and 1 piece of pork cutlet.)

1311
00:43:51,246 --> 00:43:52,475
- That will be enough.
- Okay.

1312
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,284
(Crispy)

1313
00:43:55,285 --> 00:43:56,314
It's so good.

1314
00:43:56,315 --> 00:43:57,945
(It's delicious.)

1315
00:43:58,045 --> 00:44:00,055
- Sae Ho, what did you get?
- A full set.

1316
00:44:01,015 --> 00:44:02,154
(His plates are full of food.)

1317
00:44:02,155 --> 00:44:03,285
He's bringing so much food.

1318
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:06,854
- Can I get some pork cutlet?
- I'm tired of sausages already.

1319
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:08,031
(He's having rice and sausages, which will make him age faster.)

1320
00:44:08,055 --> 00:44:09,264
Do you want one, Jong Min?

1321
00:44:09,265 --> 00:44:10,371
Give me one piece of kkakdugi.

1322
00:44:10,395 --> 00:44:11,425
No, I won't eat it.

1323
00:44:12,635 --> 00:44:14,475
SungJin, can you give me a piece of croquette?

1324
00:44:15,835 --> 00:44:17,634
(SungJin, I'll give you pork cutlet in return.)

1325
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:18,635
Gosh.

1326
00:44:20,675 --> 00:44:22,045
What? What are they doing?

1327
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:24,404
- What about me?
- Oh, my. Hold on. This is...

1328
00:44:24,405 --> 00:44:26,044
- That's too much.
- Then can I get a fried egg?

1329
00:44:26,045 --> 00:44:27,344
- No.
- No?

1330
00:44:27,345 --> 00:44:29,014
- Wait until I come to you.
- Okay.

1331
00:44:29,015 --> 00:44:30,385
(He refuses right away.)

1332
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:31,955
- Are you sure?
- Yes, go ahead.

1333
00:44:32,155 --> 00:44:33,831
- Then I'll have one piece...
- Have this too.

1334
00:44:33,855 --> 00:44:35,154
- They don't go well together.
- Thank you.

1335
00:44:35,155 --> 00:44:36,155
I think so too.

1336
00:44:36,155 --> 00:44:37,155
(Sae Ho shares his food with the DAY6 members.)

1337
00:44:37,156 --> 00:44:38,325
Thank you, Sae Ho.

1338
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:41,655
Oh, he has enough food.

1339
00:44:43,095 --> 00:44:45,195
(But all I have is rice.)

1340
00:44:45,395 --> 00:44:47,155
- So we're...
- They said we could exchange?

1341
00:44:47,495 --> 00:44:48,865
Allowed to exchange our food?

1342
00:44:50,665 --> 00:44:51,904
You don't have to do this. Come on.

1343
00:44:51,905 --> 00:44:53,805
One grain of rice would be enough for me.

1344
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:55,505
He has such good manners.

1345
00:44:55,506 --> 00:44:57,545
(The good-mannered croquette boy)

1346
00:44:58,845 --> 00:45:02,915
(Everyone enjoyed their breakfast happily.)

1347
00:45:03,515 --> 00:45:04,545
Wonpil.

1348
00:45:04,845 --> 00:45:06,554
- The pork cutlet is good, right?
- It's really good.

1349
00:45:06,555 --> 00:45:07,684
- It's good, indeed.
- You're my friend.

1350
00:45:07,685 --> 00:45:09,884
- Come back on the show.
- Okay.

1351
00:45:09,885 --> 00:45:11,384
- I had so much fun.
- It was fun.

1352
00:45:11,385 --> 00:45:13,224
Come back in winter. Let's sleep together.

1353
00:45:13,225 --> 00:45:14,255
- Right.
- Oh, gosh.

1354
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:17,894
Do you have no intention of inviting us in spring or autumn?

1355
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:20,265
It's most fun to sleep outdoors in winter.

1356
00:45:22,705 --> 00:45:23,834
Seriously.

1357
00:45:23,835 --> 00:45:25,675
Goodness, him. Seriously.

1358
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:30,945
(Dowoon met his role model Jong Min.)

1359
00:45:31,605 --> 00:45:37,914
(There have been times when he almost quit being Jong Min's fan.)

1360
00:45:37,915 --> 00:45:42,785
(But the two of them spent the most time together.)

1361
00:45:43,085 --> 00:45:44,554
- We can meet again, right?
- Really?

1362
00:45:44,555 --> 00:45:46,554
(We can meet again, right?)

1363
00:45:46,555 --> 00:45:48,565
Okay. I will come to you next time.

1364
00:45:49,165 --> 00:45:50,224
He's lying.

1365
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:51,494
(I think he's lying.)

1366
00:45:51,495 --> 00:45:54,764
I wished I was more physically fit...

1367
00:45:54,765 --> 00:45:58,675
so that I could have a better chance to win and have more fun.

1368
00:45:59,575 --> 00:46:02,145
- You did a great job.
- Me? Really? I don't think so.

1369
00:46:03,545 --> 00:46:06,075
(He was the best at games among the DAY6 members.)

1370
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:10,815
(He was the best entertainer among the members.)

1371
00:46:11,445 --> 00:46:15,355
(SungJin, as the leader of DAY6, did an amazing job on the show.)

1372
00:46:15,725 --> 00:46:18,554
- I was most excited about food.
- Right.

1373
00:46:18,555 --> 00:46:20,695
- I really enjoyed all the food.
- Did you enjoy it?

1374
00:46:22,865 --> 00:46:25,635
(With his strong determination to eat food, )

1375
00:46:26,235 --> 00:46:32,375
(he created the best eating show all day long.)

1376
00:46:32,805 --> 00:46:34,904
(My name is Kang Young Hyun. I fear nothing when food is on the line.)

1377
00:46:34,905 --> 00:46:37,504
I had so much food that I couldn't eat anymore.

1378
00:46:37,505 --> 00:46:38,515
(Fully satisfied)

1379
00:46:38,815 --> 00:46:41,175
I wish I had made more good memories here.

1380
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:43,784
I'm sad that we couldn't make more good memories together.

1381
00:46:43,785 --> 00:46:46,214
- We could take more photos.
- Exactly.

1382
00:46:46,215 --> 00:46:48,015
- I mean it. Yes.
- You had a good time here?

1383
00:46:48,525 --> 00:46:52,925
(Wonpil always smiled cheerfully.)

1384
00:46:53,995 --> 00:46:58,994
(Just like his smile, we hope this remains as a warm memory.)

1385
00:46:58,995 --> 00:47:01,435
(Just like his smile, we hope this remains as a warm memory.)

1386
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:04,905
We got the chance to be on 2 Days 1 Night...

1387
00:47:05,135 --> 00:47:06,974
and made an unforgettable memory.

1388
00:47:06,975 --> 00:47:08,375
- That's right.
- I mean it.

1389
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:13,374
(We filled a lot of pages of our youth with DAY6.)

1390
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:17,944
(We filled a lot of pages of our youth with DAY6.)

1391
00:47:17,945 --> 00:47:19,754
Everyone, I see the ocean.

1392
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:26,194
(We'll cherish this memory like a photo album.)

1393
00:47:26,195 --> 00:47:31,565
(We'll cherish this memory like a photo album.)

1394
00:47:32,495 --> 00:47:35,705
(One beautiful page of our youth)

1395
00:47:36,835 --> 00:47:40,104
We filled it to the fullest.

1396
00:47:40,105 --> 00:47:41,105
(Laughing)

1397
00:47:41,106 --> 00:47:43,005
Please show us your love.

1398
00:47:43,305 --> 00:47:44,805
The best in Korea.

1399
00:47:45,615 --> 00:47:47,445
Welcome to the real wild...

1400
00:47:48,215 --> 00:47:49,985
Road variety show.

1401
00:47:50,745 --> 00:47:51,885
Who are we?

1402
00:47:52,285 --> 00:47:53,585
- 2 Days...
- 2 Days...

1403
00:47:53,755 --> 00:47:56,225
- 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

1404
00:47:57,455 --> 00:47:59,724
- Thank you.
- That was fun.

1405
00:47:59,725 --> 00:48:00,754
(The next trip will continue now.)

1406
00:48:00,755 --> 00:48:01,995
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1407
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:05,735
(2 Days 1 Night)

1408
00:48:06,295 --> 00:48:10,165
(The place where you can enjoy nature in the city)

1409
00:48:10,535 --> 00:48:14,935
(The best tourist and outing spot on the outskirts of Seoul)

1410
00:48:15,645 --> 00:48:17,345
(Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province)

1411
00:48:18,945 --> 00:48:21,425
- The waterfall is beautiful, right?
- Yes, it's so beautiful.

1412
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:24,144
Oh, my. Look at that. Under there...

1413
00:48:24,145 --> 00:48:25,731
(The place makes you exclaim once you see it.)

1414
00:48:25,755 --> 00:48:28,155
- Gosh, it's magnificent.
- We might be able to see a fairy.

1415
00:48:28,385 --> 00:48:30,284
(The wonderful scenery of the Piano Waterfall...)

1416
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:32,254
(that drops from 91.7m high)

1417
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,894
- Let's go into the water.
- Hello.

1418
00:48:33,895 --> 00:48:35,664
- Let's dive in there right now.
- Let's do that.

1419
00:48:35,665 --> 00:48:38,064
- We should go into the water.
- Let me carry that for you.

1420
00:48:38,065 --> 00:48:39,571
(They're in a good mood as they have a shoot near Seoul.)

1421
00:48:39,595 --> 00:48:42,464
Let's dive into the water for the opening in Namyangju!

1422
00:48:42,465 --> 00:48:43,565
It's doable.

1423
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,504
It's near Seoul, but the traffic was bad.

1424
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,334
- The traffic was really bad.
- Today...

1425
00:48:47,335 --> 00:48:49,344
Because today is a holiday.

1426
00:48:49,345 --> 00:48:52,274
Joon arrived at 6:50am and had to wait for an hour.

1427
00:48:52,275 --> 00:48:53,275
I waited for 1 hour and 20 minutes.

1428
00:48:53,276 --> 00:48:54,474
- Why did you come so early?
- Why did you come so early?

1429
00:48:54,475 --> 00:48:56,885
Weren't we supposed to be on standby at 7:30am?

1430
00:48:57,085 --> 00:48:59,485
Joon was really upset.

1431
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:02,025
But I guess he didn't tell you guys.

1432
00:49:02,325 --> 00:49:04,184
- Tell us. Why were you upset?
- Tell us.

1433
00:49:04,185 --> 00:49:05,354
It wasn't just me.

1434
00:49:05,355 --> 00:49:06,894
- So was Seon Ho.
- Tell us.

1435
00:49:06,895 --> 00:49:08,054
- He spoke badly of the others.
- What did he say?

1436
00:49:08,055 --> 00:49:09,125
- Joon.
- Yes?

1437
00:49:09,465 --> 00:49:11,164
(Tell me why you're angry)

1438
00:49:11,165 --> 00:49:13,525
I mean, we were supposed to be on standby at 7:30am, right?

1439
00:49:13,665 --> 00:49:14,764
- Right.
- Right.

1440
00:49:14,765 --> 00:49:17,065
I got here at 6:50am.

1441
00:49:17,565 --> 00:49:18,804
- You were early.
- But you know it's...

1442
00:49:18,805 --> 00:49:21,035
- Why did you get so early?
- It's 8:26am right now.

1443
00:49:21,575 --> 00:49:24,074
(The opening got delayed due to heavy traffic.)

1444
00:49:24,075 --> 00:49:26,275
In fact, I got here right after 5am.

1445
00:49:26,445 --> 00:49:27,944
So you actually had breakfast and came here at 6:50am?

1446
00:49:27,945 --> 00:49:29,945
I slept at 5pm last night.

1447
00:49:30,215 --> 00:49:31,314
- Goodness.
- Unbelievable.

1448
00:49:31,315 --> 00:49:34,255
I got up at 10pm last night because I didn't want to be late.

1449
00:49:34,885 --> 00:49:36,224
(Why is he doing this?)

1450
00:49:36,225 --> 00:49:37,931
I came here early because I didn't want to be late.

1451
00:49:37,955 --> 00:49:39,895
Goodness, nobody came on time.

1452
00:49:40,295 --> 00:49:41,295
You know what Joon said?

1453
00:49:41,296 --> 00:49:43,776
"Why do you even set the time if everyone's going to be late?"

1454
00:49:44,165 --> 00:49:45,464
We were supposed to be here by 7:30am.

1455
00:49:45,465 --> 00:49:46,795
What time should we be here?

1456
00:49:46,965 --> 00:49:48,934
It's like this. "Let's eat dinner at 6pm."

1457
00:49:48,935 --> 00:49:50,664
He says, "Okay." Then he gets here at 3pm.

1458
00:49:50,665 --> 00:49:52,935
Why would you get mad at us?

1459
00:49:53,275 --> 00:49:55,304
- You can't do that.
- Right, you can't.

1460
00:49:55,305 --> 00:49:56,404
(Joon's logic isn't working.)

1461
00:49:56,405 --> 00:49:58,074
- What are you talking about?
- Why did you come so early?

1462
00:49:58,075 --> 00:50:00,555
I always come the day before we shoot according to your logic.

1463
00:50:00,745 --> 00:50:02,014
Right, he comes the day before our shoot.

1464
00:50:02,015 --> 00:50:03,744
Should I get mad the day before we start shooting?

1465
00:50:03,745 --> 00:50:05,244
Did you come the day before today as well?

1466
00:50:05,245 --> 00:50:06,985
No, I thought of doing that.

1467
00:50:07,515 --> 00:50:08,515
If he came yesterday...

1468
00:50:08,516 --> 00:50:09,984
My manager actually got shocked.

1469
00:50:09,985 --> 00:50:11,624
He said, "What? To Namyangju?"

1470
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:13,224
I wanted to come here yesterday.

1471
00:50:13,225 --> 00:50:15,394
That's disappointing. You should have come yesterday.

1472
00:50:15,395 --> 00:50:16,624
Even my wife was shocked.

1473
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:17,994
I had to stay home.

1474
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:20,165
I spent a good time with my wife.

1475
00:50:20,495 --> 00:50:21,534
That's nice.

1476
00:50:21,535 --> 00:50:23,564
- Have you all been well?
- Yes.

1477
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:26,475
You know what? It has been...

1478
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:28,774
- a very touching week for me.
- What happened?

1479
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,304
- One day, I was home after work.
- Right.

1480
00:50:31,305 --> 00:50:33,344
I found a box of beef...

1481
00:50:33,345 --> 00:50:34,545
in front of my place.

1482
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:36,714
- It was huge.
- Right.

1483
00:50:36,715 --> 00:50:40,185
It was sent by a man named Yoo Seon Ho.

1484
00:50:40,355 --> 00:50:41,355
(Proud)

1485
00:50:41,356 --> 00:50:42,554
- What?
- Seon Ho sent that?

1486
00:50:42,555 --> 00:50:44,954
- Is he doing some business?
- "Sae Ho, happy birthday."

1487
00:50:44,955 --> 00:50:46,794
We have been working together for four years.

1488
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:48,024
- Starting this year...
- Hold on a second.

1489
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:49,295
I have a reason for that.

1490
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:52,135
We all got Se Yoon's birthday wrong.

1491
00:50:52,535 --> 00:50:57,135
(About 3 months ago)

1492
00:50:57,565 --> 00:50:59,535
(They all had different answers.)

1493
00:51:00,075 --> 00:51:03,045
(That incident made Se Yoon cry.)

1494
00:51:03,345 --> 00:51:04,444
I felt really bad.

1495
00:51:04,445 --> 00:51:06,244
- It started with my birthday.
- That's right.

1496
00:51:06,245 --> 00:51:08,344
He actually sent me something for my birthday.

1497
00:51:08,345 --> 00:51:09,884
He did send me beef and all.

1498
00:51:09,885 --> 00:51:11,044
- Really?
- Yes.

1499
00:51:11,045 --> 00:51:13,045
Yours is in September. And yours is in November...

1500
00:51:13,785 --> 00:51:15,354
Do you know your birthday? Do you remember?

1501
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:17,085
- My birthday?
- Call me, call me

1502
00:51:17,785 --> 00:51:20,695
(Mocking as if they're promoting)

1503
00:51:21,425 --> 00:51:23,395
- You're mocking me?
- No.

1504
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:26,715
(Searching for birthdays whether they're bickering or not)

1505
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:31,504
- Seon Ho sent me beef.
- He did?

1506
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,875
- I...
- Thank you so much.

1507
00:51:33,105 --> 00:51:36,874
DAY 6 also contacted us.

1508
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:37,944
- Right.
- Right.

1509
00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:42,185
SungJin texted me at noon the next day.

1510
00:51:42,585 --> 00:51:44,345
"Hey, I just got up."

1511
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:46,885
He said he slept for 1 night and 2 days after shooting this.

1512
00:51:47,115 --> 00:51:49,355
- He said he learned a lot.
- He said it was exhausting.

1513
00:51:49,555 --> 00:51:51,985
Wonpil said he respected me for doing this.

1514
00:51:52,755 --> 00:51:53,755
- Respect?
- What?

1515
00:51:53,756 --> 00:51:56,725
He said he respected me for doing this every other week.

1516
00:51:57,225 --> 00:51:58,764
Wonpil is such a sweet man.

1517
00:51:58,765 --> 00:52:00,494
- He's very sweet.
- Right.

1518
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:01,835
- I miss Wonpil.
- Right.

1519
00:52:02,265 --> 00:52:04,434
- He's such a sweet man.
- Wonpil...

1520
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:06,275
Dowoon said he wanted to be on the show again.

1521
00:52:06,705 --> 00:52:08,504
- He said he had fun.
- Really?

1522
00:52:08,505 --> 00:52:10,304
I think we can call him on the day you are missing.

1523
00:52:10,305 --> 00:52:11,374
(He can replace Jong Min.)

1524
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:13,044
Dowoon seemed like he was disappointed in me.

1525
00:52:13,045 --> 00:52:14,244
(He was disappointed in me.)

1526
00:52:14,245 --> 00:52:17,114
- I wish they could join us again.
- That's funny.

1527
00:52:17,115 --> 00:52:19,054
Are you all feeling okay today?

1528
00:52:19,055 --> 00:52:20,885
Of course, we're in Namyangju.

1529
00:52:21,085 --> 00:52:23,054
Joon must be tired because he got here early.

1530
00:52:23,055 --> 00:52:24,885
I slept at 10pm last night.

1531
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:26,595
Today,

1532
00:52:27,055 --> 00:52:29,694
we're travelling around Gyeonggi Province, a place near Seoul.

1533
00:52:29,695 --> 00:52:30,895
As we travel, we will reach...

1534
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:33,594
- the last destination.
- Right.

1535
00:52:33,595 --> 00:52:34,794
(Today's base camp)

1536
00:52:34,795 --> 00:52:37,634
- We'll head to KBS, Yeouido.
- Really?

1537
00:52:37,635 --> 00:52:38,734
- What are you talking about?
- Why?

1538
00:52:38,735 --> 00:52:40,281
- Yes.
- We'll head there after the tour?

1539
00:52:40,305 --> 00:52:42,544
Don't tell me that we'll end it somewhere else...

1540
00:52:42,545 --> 00:52:43,845
after we reach Yeouido.

1541
00:52:44,605 --> 00:52:46,274
(A flash of the nightmare of the horrible schedule)

1542
00:52:46,275 --> 00:52:49,645
After giving it a long thought, we prepared it for you.

1543
00:52:50,315 --> 00:52:52,115
Today's travel concept is...

1544
00:52:52,885 --> 00:52:54,285
Going Home Today Special,

1545
00:52:56,255 --> 00:52:57,624
Home Sweet Home.

1546
00:52:57,625 --> 00:52:58,895
- What?
- What?

1547
00:53:00,025 --> 00:53:01,824
(Smiling)

1548
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:02,895
Going home today?

1549
00:53:03,165 --> 00:53:04,524
Home sweet home!

1550
00:53:04,525 --> 00:53:07,235
(Going home on the day of shooting 2 Days 1 Night)

1551
00:53:07,495 --> 00:53:10,064
(Going home mission at night 2 years ago)

1552
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:11,304
My place is right there.

1553
00:53:11,305 --> 00:53:12,934
- Yes.
- I'll go home first.

1554
00:53:12,935 --> 00:53:13,935
(Nimble footsteps)

1555
00:53:13,936 --> 00:53:17,445
(Everyone worked hard to go home that night.)

1556
00:53:17,775 --> 00:53:20,345
(It brought extreme dopamine to some.)

1557
00:53:20,845 --> 00:53:23,244
(And it also brought frustration to some people.)

1558
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:26,014
You must be kidding me. Are you for real?

1559
00:53:26,015 --> 00:53:27,135
(That day has finally come.)

1560
00:53:27,255 --> 00:53:28,925
(It's so exciting.)

1561
00:53:29,155 --> 00:53:30,524
(Some people can't smile.)

1562
00:53:30,525 --> 00:53:32,295
I don't think I can go home tonight.

1563
00:53:32,995 --> 00:53:34,655
- Why not?
- How come?

1564
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:36,624
- What's going on?
- Since we're out,

1565
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,294
we should sleep here.

1566
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:39,464
- You know...
- I mean...

1567
00:53:39,465 --> 00:53:40,865
Can you keep it as a secret?

1568
00:53:41,035 --> 00:53:43,534
Can you just keep it as usual?

1569
00:53:43,535 --> 00:53:44,704
How far can you go without telling my family?

1570
00:53:44,705 --> 00:53:46,434
My mother-in-law is coming over tonight.

1571
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:49,144
- I'm serious.
- Really? Yours too? Mine too.

1572
00:53:49,145 --> 00:53:50,145
(Me too!)

1573
00:53:50,146 --> 00:53:51,574
(That's so odd.)

1574
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:52,715
- That's odd.
- That's odd.

1575
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:53,974
(Laughing)

1576
00:53:53,975 --> 00:53:54,975
Did they plan it or what?

1577
00:53:54,976 --> 00:53:56,044
(The married men are happy.)

1578
00:53:56,045 --> 00:53:58,884
- Then you don't have to go home.
- What?

1579
00:53:58,885 --> 00:54:00,385
I can go home...

1580
00:54:00,585 --> 00:54:01,985
and say hello to my mother-in-law.

1581
00:54:02,485 --> 00:54:06,024
I'll give you all a chance to go home.

1582
00:54:06,025 --> 00:54:07,054
(It's open for all.)

1583
00:54:07,055 --> 00:54:09,795
- For those who can't go home...
- Do we have to sleep here?

1584
00:54:10,095 --> 00:54:11,624
An awful night awaits them.

1585
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:13,334
- An awful night?
- An awful night?

1586
00:54:13,335 --> 00:54:14,835
A night like Seon Ho's fart.

1587
00:54:15,495 --> 00:54:17,865
- My stomach is pretty upset.
- It's an awful night.

1588
00:54:18,265 --> 00:54:20,174
Let me tell you how to go home today.

1589
00:54:20,175 --> 00:54:22,204
People are all stepping out...

1590
00:54:22,205 --> 00:54:23,845
as soon as he mentioned going home today.

1591
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:26,945
(People going forward at the news of going home today)

1592
00:54:27,215 --> 00:54:28,614
(A mysterious panel)

1593
00:54:28,615 --> 00:54:29,615
- What's this?
- What is this?

1594
00:54:29,616 --> 00:54:31,184
- It's heavy.
- It's a board game.

1595
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:34,214
You will get to throw a dice...

1596
00:54:34,215 --> 00:54:36,055
as you complete a mission in each destination.

1597
00:54:36,285 --> 00:54:38,725
You can go home as long as you make a round.

1598
00:54:40,925 --> 00:54:41,925
Just one round?

1599
00:54:41,926 --> 00:54:43,464
So it's not a team game.

1600
00:54:43,465 --> 00:54:44,564
- Right.
- You are all on your own.

1601
00:54:44,565 --> 00:54:47,094
Do we go home right away as soon as we make a round?

1602
00:54:47,095 --> 00:54:48,095
- Yes.
- Goodness.

1603
00:54:48,096 --> 00:54:49,864
- Okay.
- Do we get next week off...

1604
00:54:49,865 --> 00:54:51,265
if we make two rounds?

1605
00:54:51,905 --> 00:54:54,904
- Two rounds?
- What's the point of this show?

1606
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:56,974
You can actually quit if you make two rounds.

1607
00:54:56,975 --> 00:54:58,144
- We have to quit the show.
- Right.

1608
00:54:58,145 --> 00:55:00,315
You have to quit if you make two rounds.

1609
00:55:00,775 --> 00:55:01,814
These two haven't done it before.

1610
00:55:01,815 --> 00:55:03,621
It's their first time going home on the day of shooting.

1611
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:06,254
After spending an awful night,

1612
00:55:06,255 --> 00:55:07,935
what time do we get off work the next day?

1613
00:55:08,285 --> 00:55:10,185
It actually depends on what you do.

1614
00:55:10,785 --> 00:55:11,924
We have to work hard.

1615
00:55:11,925 --> 00:55:13,924
I'm scared by the words, "Awful night."

1616
00:55:13,925 --> 00:55:15,524
Right, the night sounds scary...

1617
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:16,825
This is because...

1618
00:55:17,165 --> 00:55:19,394
some people have to stay behind to shoot more...

1619
00:55:19,395 --> 00:55:21,294
if some of us go home today.

1620
00:55:21,295 --> 00:55:23,234
- It must be awful.
- Some people have to.

1621
00:55:23,235 --> 00:55:25,204
- It must be tough.
- Some have to shoot more.

1622
00:55:25,205 --> 00:55:27,735
Sae Ho should stay behind because he just can shoot more.

1623
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:30,774
(Feeling pressured)

1624
00:55:30,775 --> 00:55:33,014
Once you get off work,

1625
00:55:33,015 --> 00:55:35,784
your cameraman also goes home.

1626
00:55:35,785 --> 00:55:37,514
(I trust you.)

1627
00:55:37,515 --> 00:55:39,085
Joon, why are you so quiet?

1628
00:55:39,185 --> 00:55:40,214
Are you tired already?

1629
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:42,554
- For me...
- Why are you so down?

1630
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:45,454
I have a strong feeling that I'm not going home...

1631
00:55:45,455 --> 00:55:46,524
- You think you'll stay behind.
- Nice.

1632
00:55:46,525 --> 00:55:48,055
So I'm not excited at all.

1633
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,924
You keep thinking like that.

1634
00:55:49,925 --> 00:55:51,294
In my head,

1635
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,994
I can see Joon going home.

1636
00:55:52,995 --> 00:55:54,094
- Really?
- But this is...

1637
00:55:54,095 --> 00:55:56,364
Joon's the only one who's frowning here.

1638
00:55:56,365 --> 00:55:57,764
(Joon's frowning?)

1639
00:55:57,765 --> 00:55:59,974
What? He's right! I don't look happy here.

1640
00:55:59,975 --> 00:56:01,035
Really?

1641
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:02,544
(While the rest of them look happy, )

1642
00:56:02,545 --> 00:56:05,044
(Joon looks sad somehow.)

1643
00:56:05,045 --> 00:56:07,875
This applies to the game.

1644
00:56:08,845 --> 00:56:09,984
What are you talking about?

1645
00:56:09,985 --> 00:56:12,784
You should put on a big smile.

1646
00:56:12,785 --> 00:56:14,584
- Put a picture of me smiling.
- Okay, good.

1647
00:56:14,585 --> 00:56:16,065
(Please put a picture of me smiling.)

1648
00:56:16,285 --> 00:56:19,024
(We put a picture of you smiling as per your request.)

1649
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:20,824
Please promise me one thing.

1650
00:56:20,825 --> 00:56:23,164
- I know we're going home today.
- Right.

1651
00:56:23,165 --> 00:56:25,294
But it shouldn't be like 11:59pm,

1652
00:56:25,295 --> 00:56:26,964
- and you send one person home.
- Right.

1653
00:56:26,965 --> 00:56:30,134
You should make sure one of us can have dinner at home.

1654
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:32,504
- He's a man.
- He's a real man.

1655
00:56:32,505 --> 00:56:34,434
- Let's do that.
- Sure.

1656
00:56:34,435 --> 00:56:35,435
Let's do that.

1657
00:56:35,436 --> 00:56:37,275
- Let's say that you ace it today.
- Okay.

1658
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,344
Then you can go home before dinner.

1659
00:56:40,345 --> 00:56:41,514
(You can get off work before dinner.)

1660
00:56:41,515 --> 00:56:44,285
It'd be like filming a talk show.

1661
00:56:44,515 --> 00:56:46,185
What time do you have dinner?

1662
00:56:46,815 --> 00:56:48,284
- I mean...
- What time does he have dinner?

1663
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:49,984
We eat dinner at 1am sometimes...

1664
00:56:49,985 --> 00:56:52,254
I eat from 4:30 to 8:30pm.

1665
00:56:52,255 --> 00:56:53,724
Joon slept at 5pm last night.

1666
00:56:53,725 --> 00:56:55,495
Imagine what time he had dinner last night.

1667
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:57,271
We all have different dinner hours.

1668
00:56:57,295 --> 00:56:58,664
So we stick to the normal rules.

1669
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,195
It should be 6 to 7pm.

1670
00:57:00,465 --> 00:57:01,765
A bit later than that.

1671
00:57:01,995 --> 00:57:03,465
- Then 7 to 8pm.
- Sure.

1672
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:06,204
- That sounds reasonable.
- We should be home by 7 to 8pm.

1673
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:08,574
- That sounds fair enough.
- It takes an hour to get home.

1674
00:57:08,575 --> 00:57:09,874
- Of course.
- Perfect.

1675
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:11,574
(Satisfied)

1676
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:12,614
- Okay.
- I'll go home today.

1677
00:57:12,615 --> 00:57:13,975
One of us should go home now.

1678
00:57:14,345 --> 00:57:15,345
(Laughing)

1679
00:57:15,346 --> 00:57:17,015
One of us should go home now.

1680
00:57:17,485 --> 00:57:18,844
Instead, you don't get paid. Is that okay?

1681
00:57:18,845 --> 00:57:19,885
Sure.

1682
00:57:20,585 --> 00:57:21,755
But we filmed the opening.

1683
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:23,954
You can't do that.

1684
00:57:23,955 --> 00:57:25,024
No.

1685
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,524
Are you ready?

1686
00:57:26,525 --> 00:57:28,154
- Okay.
- Let's hurry up now.

1687
00:57:28,155 --> 00:57:30,824
Let's work hard today as usual.

1688
00:57:30,825 --> 00:57:32,695
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

1689
00:57:33,295 --> 00:57:34,635
(Let's go.)

1690
00:57:35,065 --> 00:57:37,464
Going Home Today Special, Home Sweet Home.

1691
00:57:37,465 --> 00:57:40,935
Who is the lucky one who gets to sleep at home tonight?

1692
00:57:41,275 --> 00:57:44,205
Explosive dopamine and schedules.

1693
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,015
The show starts now.

1694
00:57:46,415 --> 00:57:47,575
Who are we?

1695
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,074
2 Days...

1696
00:57:49,075 --> 00:57:51,385
- 1 Night.
- 1 Night.

1697
00:57:53,155 --> 00:57:54,355
I'll go home!

1698
00:57:56,255 --> 00:57:59,025
(Going Home Special is back after 2 years.)

1699
00:58:00,025 --> 00:58:05,564
(It's more competitive than usual.)

1700
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,565
No!

1701
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:10,865
(It's more shameless than usual.)

1702
00:58:11,535 --> 00:58:15,335
(Crying and sweating)

1703
00:58:15,905 --> 00:58:20,175
(A story of leaving work on the day of shooting)

1704
00:58:20,715 --> 00:58:25,015
(Who will get to go home today?)

1705
00:58:25,385 --> 00:58:28,255
(The bus is off to get off work early.)

1706
00:58:28,515 --> 00:58:29,825
Has anyone said,

1707
00:58:30,085 --> 00:58:32,594
"Honey, I got lucky today."

1708
00:58:32,595 --> 00:58:35,394
"I get to go home today. I'll be fair with the games."

1709
00:58:35,395 --> 00:58:36,494
- No, I haven't.
- You haven't told your wife?

1710
00:58:36,495 --> 00:58:37,564
- I haven't.
- Have you?

1711
00:58:37,565 --> 00:58:39,794
- I haven't.
- I haven't either.

1712
00:58:39,795 --> 00:58:40,965
I mean...

1713
00:58:41,195 --> 00:58:42,664
I'm a newlywed.

1714
00:58:42,665 --> 00:58:44,664
I like spending time with my wife.

1715
00:58:44,665 --> 00:58:45,865
I'm a newlywed too.

1716
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:47,704
- You are?
- It has been only 16 years.

1717
00:58:47,705 --> 00:58:49,504
- What, 16 years?
- It hasn't been that long.

1718
00:58:49,505 --> 00:58:51,474
- That's not long.
- Right, it's just 16 years.

1719
00:58:51,475 --> 00:58:54,414
It hasn't been that long. It has been 23 years since dating.

1720
00:58:54,415 --> 00:58:56,055
- You know a lot about marriage.
- Right.

1721
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:59,554
Do we go to Seoul today?

1722
00:58:59,555 --> 00:59:01,514
- Yes.
- We're headed to KBS.

1723
00:59:01,515 --> 00:59:03,475
- We're headed to KBS.
- The base camp is at KBS?

1724
00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:06,054
Going home today...

1725
00:59:06,055 --> 00:59:07,424
- I'm very sensitive about this.
- Of course.

1726
00:59:07,425 --> 00:59:09,864
I'm grateful that I'm on this show.

1727
00:59:09,865 --> 00:59:12,594
- But it could be physically tiring.
- That's right.

1728
00:59:12,595 --> 00:59:15,364
Getting off work on the same day sounds really sweet.

1729
00:59:15,365 --> 00:59:18,834
What getting off work on the same day feels like to me...

1730
00:59:18,835 --> 00:59:20,774
- is the school's founding day.
- That's right.

1731
00:59:20,775 --> 00:59:22,605
That's a free holiday.

1732
00:59:22,945 --> 00:59:25,674
You obviously have to film 2 Days 1 Night over 2 days.

1733
00:59:25,675 --> 00:59:27,191
Getting off work on the same day here...

1734
00:59:27,215 --> 00:59:28,744
feels like a school's founding day.

1735
00:59:28,745 --> 00:59:30,144
A day that didn't exist before is given to you.

1736
00:59:30,145 --> 00:59:32,414
So if I can get this day with my ability,

1737
00:59:32,415 --> 00:59:34,254
- I wouldn't want to give it up.
- Right.

1738
00:59:34,255 --> 00:59:36,884
Even if it ends late, today is like a gift.

1739
00:59:36,885 --> 00:59:38,384
That's what it is even if it ends late.

1740
00:59:38,385 --> 00:59:40,424
One and a half years...

1741
00:59:40,425 --> 00:59:43,064
- Once a year.
- It's given to you like a gift.

1742
00:59:43,065 --> 00:59:44,795
- It falls like a blessing of rain.
- Yes.

1743
00:59:45,095 --> 00:59:46,635
Today is an interesting day.

1744
00:59:47,695 --> 00:59:48,794
(Namyangju Studio Complex)

1745
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:50,905
This is Namyangju Studio Complex.

1746
00:59:51,065 --> 00:59:53,834
- They filmed "Shiri" from here.
- "Shiri."

1747
00:59:53,835 --> 00:59:55,004
"Silmido" was filmed here.

1748
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:56,104
- They filmed "Silmido" here?"
- Let us go there.

1749
00:59:56,105 --> 00:59:57,274
- Yes.
- It wasn't filmed on Silmido?

1750
00:59:57,275 --> 01:00:00,014
- Goodness. What is this place?
- What's this place?

1751
01:00:00,015 --> 01:00:02,644
Many dramas and movies are filmed here.

1752
01:00:02,645 --> 01:00:04,184
Why is it so large?

1753
01:00:04,185 --> 01:00:05,514
It's really large. It's spacious.

1754
01:00:05,515 --> 01:00:07,384
- Look over there.
- It's really huge.

1755
01:00:07,385 --> 01:00:08,614
(A studio complex of approximately 1,320,000m² built to form...)

1756
01:00:08,615 --> 01:00:09,784
(and advance the technical standards of Korean cinema.)

1757
01:00:09,785 --> 01:00:11,454
Works recently filmed here are "The Match..."

1758
01:00:11,455 --> 01:00:13,424
- "The Match" was also filmed here?
- They film many things here.

1759
01:00:13,425 --> 01:00:14,894
And "The Tale of Lady Ok," the drama.

1760
01:00:14,895 --> 01:00:16,764
- "The Tale of Lady Ok?"
- Yes.

1761
01:00:16,765 --> 01:00:19,124
"Luck-Key" was post-recorded here.

1762
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,395
"Luck-Key."

1763
01:00:20,765 --> 01:00:22,334
- What is this?
- It's a hanok.

1764
01:00:22,335 --> 01:00:23,335
There are dice.

1765
01:00:23,336 --> 01:00:24,864
- Hi.
- You'd be familiar with this place.

1766
01:00:24,865 --> 01:00:27,335
That's right. I've been here to film before.

1767
01:00:27,505 --> 01:00:29,474
- All right.
- We're standing under the sun

1768
01:00:29,475 --> 01:00:32,675
It's refreshing. They're all under the shade.

1769
01:00:33,275 --> 01:00:34,714
Isn't this unfair?

1770
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,484
Come on. Let's prioritize the celebrities.

1771
01:00:37,485 --> 01:00:40,085
This is so unfair.

1772
01:00:40,215 --> 01:00:41,775
You're already covering all your faces.

1773
01:00:42,315 --> 01:00:45,224
I kept telling you. You just need to get tanned a little.

1774
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,394
- I'll start explaining right away.
- Let's do it quickly.

1775
01:00:47,395 --> 01:00:48,395
Okay. Let's go.

1776
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:51,295
The first getting-off-work game we'll play here...

1777
01:00:51,425 --> 01:00:52,965
is Find the Dice.

1778
01:00:53,835 --> 01:00:56,564
Within a ten-minute time limit, you need to find...

1779
01:00:56,565 --> 01:00:58,434
the number stickers hidden everywhere.

1780
01:00:58,435 --> 01:01:00,205
The dice have empty sides.

1781
01:01:00,535 --> 01:01:02,974
You'll find number stickers when you enter.

1782
01:01:02,975 --> 01:01:05,774
You'll find them and stick them onto your dice.

1783
01:01:05,775 --> 01:01:08,144
Once you find the stickers,

1784
01:01:08,145 --> 01:01:11,114
you have to decide right there whether to stick it or skip it.

1785
01:01:11,115 --> 01:01:12,361
(The stickers can't be removed once stuck.)

1786
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:16,654
(It's a race in which they'll need both luck and good judgment.)

1787
01:01:16,655 --> 01:01:18,784
(4 sides with 6, 4 sides with 5, 6 sides with 4)

1788
01:01:18,785 --> 01:01:21,095
(6 sides with 1, 6 sides with 2, 6 sides with 3)

1789
01:01:21,425 --> 01:01:23,924
You can stick it if you think...

1790
01:01:23,925 --> 01:01:25,594
- moving forward is still better.
- That's right.

1791
01:01:25,595 --> 01:01:26,934
When the time's up,

1792
01:01:26,935 --> 01:01:28,994
you'll roll the dice you made,

1793
01:01:28,995 --> 01:01:32,065
and you'll move on the board by the number you rolled.

1794
01:01:32,565 --> 01:01:34,804
What if you can't stick it on one side and it stays blank?

1795
01:01:34,805 --> 01:01:36,444
The blank side counts as zero.

1796
01:01:36,445 --> 01:01:37,644
- Then...
- You can't move many moves.

1797
01:01:37,645 --> 01:01:38,905
Only one number...

1798
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:41,845
Hold on. Could you keep my bag? It's precious.

1799
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:44,685
Give me one scrubbing towel. I'll scrub them.

1800
01:01:44,945 --> 01:01:46,555
I'll do my best and run around.

1801
01:01:47,085 --> 01:01:50,025
You'll see the reason I go running today.

1802
01:01:50,155 --> 01:01:52,924
Can I hit them and take the stickers from them?

1803
01:01:52,925 --> 01:01:54,954
No. Be nice to each other.

1804
01:01:54,955 --> 01:01:56,964
But physically,

1805
01:01:56,965 --> 01:01:59,264
people who are fat may be at a disadvantage.

1806
01:01:59,265 --> 01:02:01,264
There are chances I'll get to places after they've already left.

1807
01:02:01,265 --> 01:02:03,264
Then you shouldn't have eaten up until now.

1808
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:05,134
- That's...
- Right.

1809
01:02:05,135 --> 01:02:07,434
You've eaten and enjoyed all you wanted until now.

1810
01:02:07,435 --> 01:02:10,074
In that case, my legs are shorter than yours.

1811
01:02:10,075 --> 01:02:11,844
- Do I get a benefit? No.
- That's right.

1812
01:02:11,845 --> 01:02:13,274
Did I go running at night for nothing?

1813
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:15,174
Do you think I don't crave chicken at night?

1814
01:02:15,175 --> 01:02:17,544
- I just didn't eat it.
- Are you a fool?

1815
01:02:17,545 --> 01:02:18,584
(Sobbing)

1816
01:02:18,585 --> 01:02:20,154
Are you all ready?

1817
01:02:20,155 --> 01:02:21,454
- Yes!
- All right.

1818
01:02:21,455 --> 01:02:23,755
Ready, start!

1819
01:02:26,395 --> 01:02:27,455
(Exclaiming)

1820
01:02:29,865 --> 01:02:32,225
(On the gate they're running to...)

1821
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:38,434
(There's a side with 6.)

1822
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:41,075
- You'll get hurt.
- You'll get hurt.

1823
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:42,574
You'll get hurt.

1824
01:02:42,575 --> 01:02:44,675
(It's always darkest under the lamp.)

1825
01:02:45,445 --> 01:02:46,475
You'll get hurt.

1826
01:02:48,715 --> 01:02:51,945
(Someone is checking under the lamp.)

1827
01:02:53,285 --> 01:02:55,354
(Lee Joon gets a 6.)

1828
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,985
He found one immediately.

1829
01:02:59,225 --> 01:03:00,824
(The miracle getting off work on the same day brought, )

1830
01:03:00,825 --> 01:03:01,825
(Meticulous Joon)

1831
01:03:04,295 --> 01:03:05,865
- What's this?
- What is this?

1832
01:03:06,795 --> 01:03:09,035
(A padlock?)

1833
01:03:11,235 --> 01:03:12,705
You have to open it.

1834
01:03:13,435 --> 01:03:15,375
Roll the dice in the box.

1835
01:03:16,005 --> 01:03:19,304
(They have to count all these.)

1836
01:03:19,305 --> 01:03:21,074
- Go away.
- Why? Let's do it together.

1837
01:03:21,075 --> 01:03:22,274
- I'm doing it now.
- Let's do it together.

1838
01:03:22,275 --> 01:03:23,714
You have to count all these.

1839
01:03:23,715 --> 01:03:25,144
I won't do this. I can't do it.

1840
01:03:25,145 --> 01:03:27,105
(The person who gave up on math leaves the area.)

1841
01:03:27,415 --> 01:03:28,914
There are so many.

1842
01:03:28,915 --> 01:03:29,925
(To DinDin, a padlock...)

1843
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:32,685
(is always a lucky destiny.)

1844
01:03:33,195 --> 01:03:37,224
(He always opened them by guessing.)

1845
01:03:37,225 --> 01:03:39,695
(He tries to open it by guessing the code again.)

1846
01:03:39,895 --> 01:03:40,994
(A strong padlock was prepared so he can't guess.)

1847
01:03:40,995 --> 01:03:42,035
I'm doomed.

1848
01:03:42,905 --> 01:03:45,205
(In the end, he starts counting them 1 by 1.)

1849
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:48,574
(DinDin spends his time opening the lock.)

1850
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,044
Goodness.

1851
01:03:50,045 --> 01:03:51,744
(Jong Min)

1852
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:54,615
(Jong Min heads straight to the well in the corner.)

1853
01:03:55,145 --> 01:03:57,615
(He finds one right away.)

1854
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,855
(Jong Min gets a 4.)

1855
01:04:01,515 --> 01:04:03,655
(There was a camera right in front of it.)

1856
01:04:04,085 --> 01:04:05,884
(He follows the camera angle.)

1857
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:06,895
There it is.

1858
01:04:09,395 --> 01:04:10,424
(Shocking)

1859
01:04:10,425 --> 01:04:12,065
You should be clever.

1860
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:14,435
Did you see that?

1861
01:04:15,195 --> 01:04:16,935
I'm above the production crew.

1862
01:04:18,965 --> 01:04:20,174
I should go here.

1863
01:04:20,175 --> 01:04:21,905
(Sae Ho was right next to him.)

1864
01:04:22,105 --> 01:04:23,175
What?

1865
01:04:24,205 --> 01:04:25,245
Here.

1866
01:04:26,515 --> 01:04:28,114
(Sae Ho finds a 2.)

1867
01:04:28,115 --> 01:04:29,985
It's here. Let me stick it.

1868
01:04:30,715 --> 01:04:33,455
(He starts searching the rooms.)

1869
01:04:33,855 --> 01:04:34,885
There's one here.

1870
01:04:35,715 --> 01:04:37,925
It's a two again. I'll stick it.

1871
01:04:38,355 --> 01:04:39,554
I should move forward.

1872
01:04:39,555 --> 01:04:40,754
(Sae Ho still sticks the 2.)

1873
01:04:40,755 --> 01:04:42,624
I didn't start well.

1874
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:43,865
(He's heading to another room.)

1875
01:04:44,595 --> 01:04:45,595
It's here.

1876
01:04:45,596 --> 01:04:47,465
(He found one again?)

1877
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:49,435
It's a two again.

1878
01:04:49,935 --> 01:04:51,105
This is driving me crazy.

1879
01:04:51,665 --> 01:04:53,935
I should still stick it.

1880
01:04:54,535 --> 01:04:55,904
We only have ten minutes.

1881
01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:58,275
(Sae Ho has 3 out of 6 stickers with a 2.)

1882
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,645
(He finds one again.)

1883
01:05:02,075 --> 01:05:04,915
(He really needs a higher number.)

1884
01:05:06,785 --> 01:05:08,015
It's a two again.

1885
01:05:08,415 --> 01:05:09,625
Why are there only twos?

1886
01:05:13,825 --> 01:05:17,124
(Trudging)

1887
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:19,865
(It looks like he's in trouble too.)

1888
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:21,635
There's nothing here. Oh, it's here.

1889
01:05:23,365 --> 01:05:24,564
Just stick it first.

1890
01:05:24,565 --> 01:05:25,664
(The younger brother also finds a 2 after the older brother.)

1891
01:05:25,665 --> 01:05:26,805
This is how it goes?

1892
01:05:27,775 --> 01:05:29,404
- Just stick it first.
- What sticker do you have?

1893
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:30,475
Two, two, and two.

1894
01:05:32,705 --> 01:05:35,275
(A room with a number sticker)

1895
01:05:36,045 --> 01:05:39,045
(This room has the sticker with 6.)

1896
01:05:39,245 --> 01:05:41,515
(Is there anything?)

1897
01:05:41,885 --> 01:05:43,824
(Is he finally freed from the curse of finding stickers with 2?)

1898
01:05:43,825 --> 01:05:45,085
This is crazy.

1899
01:05:48,155 --> 01:05:49,624
I just need 1 sticker with 4.

1900
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:51,295
(He didn't see that?)

1901
01:05:51,525 --> 01:05:52,864
How did everyone find so many?

1902
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:54,395
(Luck is also a skill.)

1903
01:05:54,865 --> 01:05:57,465
(Sticker 6 was left all alone.)

1904
01:05:57,905 --> 01:05:58,934
That startled me.

1905
01:05:58,935 --> 01:06:00,005
(Opening the door)

1906
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:03,845
(Meticulous Man, Lee Joon, appears.)

1907
01:06:04,675 --> 01:06:07,045
(Lee Joon finds another sticker with a 6.)

1908
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:10,445
(He found 2 out of 4 stickers with a 6.)

1909
01:06:10,645 --> 01:06:13,084
(He enters the next room.)

1910
01:06:13,085 --> 01:06:15,785
(He finds a 3...)

1911
01:06:15,815 --> 01:06:19,085
(and a 4 soon after.)

1912
01:06:23,295 --> 01:06:25,164
Five minutes have passed!

1913
01:06:25,165 --> 01:06:26,294
(They have 5 minutes left.)

1914
01:06:26,295 --> 01:06:27,664
Five minutes?

1915
01:06:27,665 --> 01:06:29,825
Go and find stickers. Will you be all right with that?

1916
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:35,204
(DinDin has already crossed the river.)

1917
01:06:35,205 --> 01:06:37,945
(The pressure increases.)

1918
01:06:38,145 --> 01:06:39,875
Just one. I can't find any.

1919
01:06:42,745 --> 01:06:44,284
(Se Yoon finds a sticker with a 3 for the 1st time.)

1920
01:06:44,285 --> 01:06:45,345
I should stick it.

1921
01:06:45,445 --> 01:06:46,984
(Everyone except DinDin is filling the sides of their die.)

1922
01:06:46,985 --> 01:06:47,985
(Se Yoon)

1923
01:06:47,985 --> 01:06:48,985
Here.

1924
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,585
It's crazy.

1925
01:06:52,155 --> 01:06:54,895
(He found a 5.)

1926
01:06:55,325 --> 01:06:57,064
I'm doomed.

1927
01:06:57,065 --> 01:06:58,065
What is it?

1928
01:06:58,895 --> 01:06:59,994
What is this?

1929
01:06:59,995 --> 01:07:01,695
(He's really doomed.)

1930
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,305
This is crazy.

1931
01:07:04,305 --> 01:07:06,975
(Se Yoon)

1932
01:07:07,305 --> 01:07:09,705
These numbers are still around?

1933
01:07:10,305 --> 01:07:11,374
Why?

1934
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:13,275
(He found another 5.)

1935
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,344
(He finds another 3 right after that.)

1936
01:07:15,345 --> 01:07:16,345
Okay.

1937
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:20,084
(Se Yoon became rich all of a sudden.)

1938
01:07:20,085 --> 01:07:23,425
Remaining time, three minutes!

1939
01:07:23,785 --> 01:07:25,485
No. I can't give up now.

1940
01:07:26,655 --> 01:07:28,095
You're still working on that?

1941
01:07:28,255 --> 01:07:29,424
What are you doing?

1942
01:07:29,425 --> 01:07:31,765
If he fails at that, he'll get nothing.

1943
01:07:32,395 --> 01:07:35,394
(He finished sorting out the Go stones.)

1944
01:07:35,395 --> 01:07:38,365
(Now he has to calculate.)

1945
01:07:38,905 --> 01:07:41,205
Eighty-one. Nine.

1946
01:07:42,905 --> 01:07:44,545
The time!

1947
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:47,215
One hundred thirty-seven.

1948
01:07:48,215 --> 01:07:50,715
One hundred thirty-seven.

1949
01:07:51,585 --> 01:07:54,314
(His 1st attempt)

1950
01:07:54,315 --> 01:07:56,925
(It's a failure.)

1951
01:07:57,285 --> 01:07:58,824
I think something is wrong here.

1952
01:07:58,825 --> 01:07:59,925
No, it's not.

1953
01:08:00,218 --> 01:08:01,234
I think something is wrong here.

1954
01:08:01,258 --> 01:08:02,268
No, it's not.

1955
01:08:02,797 --> 01:08:05,597
(Let's calm down.)

1956
01:08:05,897 --> 01:08:08,767
(He can count, but he can't calculate in his head.)

1957
01:08:11,297 --> 01:08:14,237
(He spots another camera.)

1958
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,137
(He adds a 5.)

1959
01:08:18,477 --> 01:08:21,507
There are two minutes left!

1960
01:08:22,177 --> 01:08:23,816
- Look in the crocks!
- It could be...

1961
01:08:23,817 --> 01:08:24,847
Gosh!

1962
01:08:25,347 --> 01:08:26,747
Something is popping out!

1963
01:08:27,847 --> 01:08:29,216
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1964
01:08:29,217 --> 01:08:31,157
What am I to do?

1965
01:08:31,827 --> 01:08:33,687
- Yes!
- What?

1966
01:08:35,757 --> 01:08:37,126
How did he find so many?

1967
01:08:37,127 --> 01:08:38,427
(He runs away to the corner.)

1968
01:08:38,727 --> 01:08:40,207
You guys have to stick it right away.

1969
01:08:40,727 --> 01:08:42,136
No trading numbers.

1970
01:08:42,137 --> 01:08:43,497
(Jong Min gets the last number 6.)

1971
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:48,167
(Jong Min's sight has been enhanced before getting off work.)

1972
01:08:48,737 --> 01:08:51,407
(He isn't satisfied with low numbers.)

1973
01:08:52,777 --> 01:08:54,077
Hold on. Where are you going?

1974
01:08:54,347 --> 01:08:55,416
Awesome. It's right here.

1975
01:08:55,417 --> 01:08:56,417
(He suddenly grabs the cameraman.)

1976
01:08:56,418 --> 01:08:57,876
(It was literally right under his nose.)

1977
01:08:57,877 --> 01:08:59,186
Hey!

1978
01:08:59,187 --> 01:09:01,687
What's wrong with you? Gosh.

1979
01:09:01,787 --> 01:09:05,057
(They fight for the cameraman to get off work.)

1980
01:09:05,527 --> 01:09:06,757
What a thug.

1981
01:09:07,757 --> 01:09:08,757
Gosh.

1982
01:09:08,758 --> 01:09:10,397
(He adds a 4.)

1983
01:09:10,697 --> 01:09:11,827
This is driving me crazy.

1984
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:14,196
You're going to stick that on?

1985
01:09:14,197 --> 01:09:15,877
(He finds the 2 that Jong Min gave up on.)

1986
01:09:16,567 --> 01:09:18,867
(Se Yoon finds a 1.)

1987
01:09:19,207 --> 01:09:20,267
Which number did you find?

1988
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,807
You take it.

1989
01:09:22,177 --> 01:09:23,677
No. I'll take it.

1990
01:09:25,807 --> 01:09:27,746
(Se Yoon just sticks the 1.)

1991
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,917
A one is better than nothing.

1992
01:09:30,377 --> 01:09:31,416
I just need to avoid being in last place.

1993
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,387
I've learned that while being on 2 Days 1 Night.

1994
01:09:33,547 --> 01:09:35,227
You should never aim to be in first place.

1995
01:09:35,657 --> 01:09:37,386
Move around spectacularly.

1996
01:09:37,387 --> 01:09:38,657
(Relaxed)

1997
01:09:39,257 --> 01:09:41,326
(I, Moon Se Yoon, )

1998
01:09:41,327 --> 01:09:44,126
(am the owner of the first die.)

1999
01:09:44,127 --> 01:09:47,667
(Spinning around)

2000
01:09:48,027 --> 01:09:51,497
There is one minute left!

2001
01:09:51,837 --> 01:09:53,907
Move at least one square after finding it.

2002
01:09:54,437 --> 01:09:56,207
I'm doomed.

2003
01:09:56,677 --> 01:09:57,736
- Why?
- I'm doomed.

2004
01:09:57,737 --> 01:09:58,807
Do you want help?

2005
01:09:58,977 --> 01:10:00,047
Don't do anything.

2006
01:10:00,247 --> 01:10:03,777
(The others are doing their best until the end as well.)

2007
01:10:05,217 --> 01:10:06,786
Why aren't you able to solve it?

2008
01:10:06,787 --> 01:10:08,557
(The one who is in the most trouble)

2009
01:10:09,557 --> 01:10:10,917
There are 20 seconds left!

2010
01:10:16,727 --> 01:10:17,857
It's 1496.

2011
01:10:19,197 --> 01:10:21,837
(He finally came up with the second answer.)

2012
01:10:23,037 --> 01:10:24,196
There are ten seconds left!

2013
01:10:24,197 --> 01:10:26,137
Nine, eight,

2014
01:10:26,537 --> 01:10:28,736
seven, six... Hurry!

2015
01:10:28,737 --> 01:10:31,436
- Five, four, three...
- Four, three...

2016
01:10:31,437 --> 01:10:34,007
(It has opened!)

2017
01:10:35,317 --> 01:10:36,516
Gosh, I did it.

2018
01:10:36,517 --> 01:10:38,416
(DinDin gets 4 number 6s with a buzzer beater.)

2019
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:40,587
- He opened it!
- Take this!

2020
01:10:41,187 --> 01:10:44,087
What? My gosh!

2021
01:10:44,257 --> 01:10:45,957
- It was so difficult!
- Did you get four?

2022
01:10:46,257 --> 01:10:47,827
- Four!
- Gosh!

2023
01:10:48,057 --> 01:10:49,957
Gosh, it was so difficult!

2024
01:10:50,197 --> 01:10:52,067
I told you I was going to make it, didn't I?

2025
01:10:52,827 --> 01:10:54,927
You can't stop DinDin who wants to go home!

2026
01:10:55,697 --> 01:10:59,367
Gosh! I just got goosebumps!

2027
01:10:59,907 --> 01:11:00,907
Gosh!

2028
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:03,636
(Attacking their eardrums)

2029
01:11:03,637 --> 01:11:04,837
Go home.

2030
01:11:05,707 --> 01:11:07,467
Is it right for me to be sweating this much?

2031
01:11:08,407 --> 01:11:09,546
(Sae Ho went to the SUMMERSWAG on his own.)

2032
01:11:09,547 --> 01:11:10,817
Aren't I sweating too much?

2033
01:11:12,617 --> 01:11:14,286
(Dripping)

2034
01:11:14,287 --> 01:11:16,087
- Gosh.
- You must've worked so hard.

2035
01:11:16,357 --> 01:11:17,457
Could it possibly be a one?

2036
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:18,986
- Number 66.
- All right.

2037
01:11:18,987 --> 01:11:21,186
- It's based on luck now.
- Right.

2038
01:11:21,187 --> 01:11:23,396
You each can take turns to roll the dice.

2039
01:11:23,397 --> 01:11:24,526
Let's start with the youngest.

2040
01:11:24,527 --> 01:11:26,126
I'll start first. I wasn't able to find many of them anyway.

2041
01:11:26,127 --> 01:11:27,266
Who will go first?

2042
01:11:27,267 --> 01:11:28,597
- I'll go first.
- Okay!

2043
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:29,867
Let's go!

2044
01:11:30,967 --> 01:11:33,536
I have no expectations at all. My highest number is two.

2045
01:11:33,537 --> 01:11:34,867
Then you will get a zero.

2046
01:11:37,207 --> 01:11:38,207
Let's go!

2047
01:11:38,777 --> 01:11:40,577
You should still get the highest number, two.

2048
01:11:40,647 --> 01:11:42,216
(Please let me get at least a 2.)

2049
01:11:42,217 --> 01:11:43,977
It's zero.

2050
01:11:45,247 --> 01:11:48,087
(Seon Ho moves 0 spaces.)

2051
01:11:49,157 --> 01:11:52,057
(Unbelievable reality)

2052
01:11:52,327 --> 01:11:53,686
(Let's toast!)

2053
01:11:53,687 --> 01:11:57,097
- Zero chance to go home!
- It happened.

2054
01:11:57,957 --> 01:12:00,366
(Teasing)

2055
01:12:00,367 --> 01:12:03,697
Zero chance to go home!

2056
01:12:04,197 --> 01:12:06,906
(It's DinDin's turn.)

2057
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:09,777
I feel really scared as the two sides are empty.

2058
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:11,006
Here I go!

2059
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,306
- That can't possibly happen.
- Okay. Please.

2060
01:12:12,307 --> 01:12:14,107
It can't be. Get all of the spotlight!

2061
01:12:14,407 --> 01:12:15,916
(Will he be rewarded for being obsessed...)

2062
01:12:15,917 --> 01:12:17,376
(with the lock for 10 minutes?)

2063
01:12:17,377 --> 01:12:18,886
- That's it!
- All right!

2064
01:12:18,887 --> 01:12:21,117
- It's 0!
- It's 0!

2065
01:12:21,447 --> 01:12:23,987
It's zero!

2066
01:12:26,527 --> 01:12:28,057
It's zero!

2067
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:30,897
It's zero!

2068
01:12:35,497 --> 01:12:37,136
(DinDin moves forward 6 spaces.)

2069
01:12:37,137 --> 01:12:39,467
- That was lame.
- He moves forward by six spaces.

2070
01:12:39,967 --> 01:12:41,236
(A ceremony for his victory)

2071
01:12:41,237 --> 01:12:43,506
- That was lame.
- He moves forward by six spaces.

2072
01:12:43,507 --> 01:12:46,206
(Feeling bitter)

2073
01:12:46,207 --> 01:12:49,276
- Six!
- He moves so much.

2074
01:12:49,277 --> 01:12:51,576
DinDin, you will move forward six spaces.

2075
01:12:51,577 --> 01:12:55,017
- One, two, three, four, five, six.
- Six!

2076
01:12:55,357 --> 01:12:56,786
All right. Who will go next?

2077
01:12:56,787 --> 01:12:58,256
- Will you go next, Sae Ho?
- Okay.

2078
01:12:58,257 --> 01:13:00,186
- Right.
- It's 4 numbers 2s and 1 number 4.

2079
01:13:00,187 --> 01:13:01,286
- Okay.
- I couldn't find the good numbers.

2080
01:13:01,287 --> 01:13:02,527
It's either 2 or 0.

2081
01:13:02,897 --> 01:13:04,196
(He could move 0 spaces if he gets the empty side.)

2082
01:13:04,197 --> 01:13:06,127
- Zero!
- Zero!

2083
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:08,996
(Everyone calls out...)

2084
01:13:08,997 --> 01:13:11,466
(for that number, 0.)

2085
01:13:11,467 --> 01:13:13,506
- Zero!
- Zero!

2086
01:13:13,507 --> 01:13:14,666
- I got two.
- Gosh.

2087
01:13:14,667 --> 01:13:15,876
Gosh, that was close!

2088
01:13:15,877 --> 01:13:17,376
Sae Ho moves forward two spaces.

2089
01:13:17,377 --> 01:13:19,077
- I couldn't get the four.
- Gosh.

2090
01:13:19,707 --> 01:13:21,447
- Should I go next?
- Go ahead.

2091
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:22,946
How many numbers do you have for you to be acting like that?

2092
01:13:22,947 --> 01:13:24,976
- I'm going to get a one.
- He must have a lot of numbers.

2093
01:13:24,977 --> 01:13:26,216
He has a lot of sixes.

2094
01:13:26,217 --> 01:13:27,546
- No. I don't.
- Gosh.

2095
01:13:27,547 --> 01:13:29,016
- Show us. Why are you hiding it?
- Leave me alone!

2096
01:13:29,017 --> 01:13:30,233
- Show us.
- I'll show you now.

2097
01:13:30,257 --> 01:13:31,293
- What is he doing?
- Here I go!

2098
01:13:31,317 --> 01:13:32,856
- One!
- Let's see.

2099
01:13:32,857 --> 01:13:34,056
- Here I go!
- Yes!

2100
01:13:34,057 --> 01:13:36,527
The number-one dice. One, two, and go!

2101
01:13:36,657 --> 01:13:37,777
He has a lot of big numbers.

2102
01:13:37,927 --> 01:13:39,126
- What?
- Was there a seven too?

2103
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:40,247
He has a variety of numbers.

2104
01:13:42,867 --> 01:13:45,637
(Jong Min moves forward 6 spaces too.)

2105
01:13:46,037 --> 01:13:47,466
(I'll be there, Mother-in-law!)

2106
01:13:47,467 --> 01:13:49,437
- What?
- He got a six.

2107
01:13:49,777 --> 01:13:52,507
There's a way to find them. I'll teach you later.

2108
01:13:53,947 --> 01:13:56,417
- He had 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, and 1.
- Gosh.

2109
01:13:57,047 --> 01:13:58,217
I quit.

2110
01:13:59,047 --> 01:14:00,316
- Are you sure?
- No.

2111
01:14:00,317 --> 01:14:01,837
- I want to continue.
- If you quit...

2112
01:14:02,357 --> 01:14:04,087
Jong Min moves forward six spaces.

2113
01:14:04,557 --> 01:14:06,157
- Joon also has sixes.
- Right.

2114
01:14:06,387 --> 01:14:09,726
I have 6, 6, 5, 4, and 3.

2115
01:14:09,727 --> 01:14:11,397
You have a zero too.

2116
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:13,426
- One side is 0.
- Please get the 0!

2117
01:14:13,427 --> 01:14:15,336
- Show them, Joon!
- Let's see.

2118
01:14:15,337 --> 01:14:17,566
- Zero!
- That's cool.

2119
01:14:17,567 --> 01:14:18,806
- Here we go!
- What is that?

2120
01:14:18,807 --> 01:14:20,166
Doing those things usually leads to bad results.

2121
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:22,047
- It's going to be a 0.
- It's going to be a 0!

2122
01:14:22,137 --> 01:14:24,536
(The lead...)

2123
01:14:24,537 --> 01:14:26,947
(is ours.)

2124
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:32,516
- Zero!
- Zero!

2125
01:14:32,517 --> 01:14:33,917
- Roll back!
- Zero!

2126
01:14:34,287 --> 01:14:36,086
(Shocking)

2127
01:14:36,087 --> 01:14:37,386
There were a lot of sixes.

2128
01:14:37,387 --> 01:14:39,056
(A war to get off work)

2129
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:40,356
How was that possible?

2130
01:14:40,357 --> 01:14:42,533
- They're going to leave early.
- I'm different from the past me.

2131
01:14:42,557 --> 01:14:44,326
There will be too many competitors now.

2132
01:14:44,327 --> 01:14:45,357
Six spaces.

2133
01:14:45,627 --> 01:14:47,967
I almost died trying to get 4 number 6s.

2134
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:49,996
- All spaces are filled for mine.
- Right.

2135
01:14:49,997 --> 01:14:51,336
I'll move no matter what. I have 1, 3, and 5.

2136
01:14:51,337 --> 01:14:52,766
I have 2 number 1s, 2 number 2s, and 2 number 5s.

2137
01:14:52,767 --> 01:14:54,466
- The highest is five.
- You have great numbers.

2138
01:14:54,467 --> 01:14:56,207
I ended things quickly over there.

2139
01:14:56,377 --> 01:14:57,437
Here I go!

2140
01:14:58,577 --> 01:14:59,807
Please give me a five.

2141
01:15:00,407 --> 01:15:02,717
(He threw it.)

2142
01:15:03,077 --> 01:15:06,687
(Will he join the intense lead group?)

2143
01:15:07,547 --> 01:15:12,057
- One!
- One!

2144
01:15:12,087 --> 01:15:14,756
(Please!)

2145
01:15:14,757 --> 01:15:16,227
One!

2146
01:15:18,497 --> 01:15:21,026
- One!
- One!

2147
01:15:21,027 --> 01:15:23,397
- Yes!
- One!

2148
01:15:24,137 --> 01:15:25,967
- Yes!
- One!

2149
01:15:27,207 --> 01:15:29,337
- Yes!
- One!

2150
01:15:30,237 --> 01:15:32,276
We are forever together!

2151
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:35,577
(Dreams come true.)

2152
01:15:35,617 --> 01:15:37,177
Se Yoon moves forward one space.

2153
01:15:38,677 --> 01:15:41,486
That was just the first round.

2154
01:15:41,487 --> 01:15:43,456
That was the first round, and they went almost halfway.

2155
01:15:43,457 --> 01:15:45,156
- Let's move to the next spot.
- Right.

2156
01:15:45,157 --> 01:15:47,056
- Okay!
- Let's go!

2157
01:15:47,057 --> 01:15:49,556
- What was that?
- Check this out.

2158
01:15:49,557 --> 01:15:51,156
Is it still early for me to be disappointed?

2159
01:15:51,157 --> 01:15:52,727
- Of course.
- I'm feeling so annoyed.

2160
01:15:52,897 --> 01:15:56,766
- Starting with six could be great, - It doesn't mean much.

2161
01:15:56,767 --> 01:15:58,166
But the next one could involve "divide by three."

2162
01:15:58,167 --> 01:15:59,206
We'll have to see.

2163
01:15:59,207 --> 01:16:01,706
Right. The next one will be important.

2164
01:16:01,707 --> 01:16:02,707
Right.

2165
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,336
I feel like there will be a mission that involves bicycles.

2166
01:16:04,337 --> 01:16:06,747
Namyangju is known for cycling.

2167
01:16:07,207 --> 01:16:10,177
(Namyangju where the Bukhan River and Namhan River meet together)

2168
01:16:11,017 --> 01:16:13,916
(With the cool river breeze, )

2169
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:16,757
(cycling can be enjoyed here.)

2170
01:16:17,417 --> 01:16:19,957
(Is the next mission related to bicycles?)

2171
01:16:20,257 --> 01:16:21,487
Where are we going now?

2172
01:16:21,687 --> 01:16:22,956
We will now...

2173
01:16:22,957 --> 01:16:24,797
- Are we running again?
- Will we be sweating?

2174
01:16:25,057 --> 01:16:26,427
- It's time for lunch.
- Well,

2175
01:16:26,767 --> 01:16:28,566
we'll be heading to a spot that feels less hot.

2176
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:29,666
- Right.
- Right.

2177
01:16:29,667 --> 01:16:31,067
- It must be inside.
- Right.

2178
01:16:31,497 --> 01:16:33,167
Before we head to the next spot,

2179
01:16:33,707 --> 01:16:35,207
you must know that this mission...

2180
01:16:36,637 --> 01:16:38,307
- is a team mission.
- What?

2181
01:16:39,107 --> 01:16:40,506
Let's split into teams first.

2182
01:16:40,507 --> 01:16:42,076
The 3 of you with 6s shouldn't be in the same team.

2183
01:16:42,077 --> 01:16:43,553
- Make it even.
- That sounds perfect.

2184
01:16:43,577 --> 01:16:46,747
(Worried that the top 3 will be on the same team)

2185
01:16:46,947 --> 01:16:48,186
Listen up, Se Yoon.

2186
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:50,056
Let's say the three at the top become a team.

2187
01:16:50,057 --> 01:16:51,856
There's nothing to say...

2188
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,386
if the ones at the top win,

2189
01:16:53,387 --> 01:16:55,486
but it's a chance for you to catch up against them if they lose.

2190
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:57,297
- Right.
- But that's a big risk.

2191
01:16:57,497 --> 01:16:59,296
- Right.
- We shouldn't do that.

2192
01:16:59,297 --> 01:17:01,427
This is a show that is watched by the whole family.

2193
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,767
My son, daughter, and mother-in-law all watch the show.

2194
01:17:04,237 --> 01:17:05,606
Nobody should be left out.

2195
01:17:05,607 --> 01:17:07,237
I'm not in last place right now,

2196
01:17:07,407 --> 01:17:09,167
- but we're at the bottom together.
- Right.

2197
01:17:09,277 --> 01:17:10,776
The 2 of us at the bottom should pick 2 teammates.

2198
01:17:10,777 --> 01:17:12,906
- Sure.
- The youngest...

2199
01:17:12,907 --> 01:17:14,976
- Sounds good.
- Let's give each other a chance.

2200
01:17:14,977 --> 01:17:16,276
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

2201
01:17:16,277 --> 01:17:18,747
- But, actually, - The teams have been decided?

2202
01:17:18,917 --> 01:17:20,286
The teams have already been decided.

2203
01:17:20,287 --> 01:17:22,016
- What?
- What?

2204
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:23,286
The teams have been decided?

2205
01:17:23,287 --> 01:17:25,586
- Why not tell us before we talked?
- That's unbelievable.

2206
01:17:25,587 --> 01:17:27,626
- Gosh.
- That's hard to believe.

2207
01:17:27,627 --> 01:17:29,156
I already thought about which two to choose.

2208
01:17:29,157 --> 01:17:30,556
It was you and Sae Ho for me.

2209
01:17:30,557 --> 01:17:32,156
- Really?
- Is that so?

2210
01:17:32,157 --> 01:17:34,496
There are water bottles in front of all of you.

2211
01:17:34,497 --> 01:17:36,336
- Please check the bottom.
- Gosh.

2212
01:17:36,337 --> 01:17:37,337
- What?
- What?

2213
01:17:37,567 --> 01:17:39,637
(On the bottom of the water bottles, )

2214
01:17:40,237 --> 01:17:42,637
(there are green or yellow stickers.)

2215
01:17:43,837 --> 01:17:46,206
(The teams were decided as soon as they took their seats.)

2216
01:17:46,207 --> 01:17:48,046
- We just sat down.
- What?

2217
01:17:48,047 --> 01:17:49,776
- I have yellow.
- I have yellow.

2218
01:17:49,777 --> 01:17:51,017
- I have green.
- I have green.

2219
01:17:51,177 --> 01:17:53,216
- Yellow. Gosh, it's Yoo Seon Ho.
- I have green.

2220
01:17:53,217 --> 01:17:56,387
- Green.
- Gosh, I'm with the unlucky one.

2221
01:17:56,557 --> 01:17:57,856
Let's go home.

2222
01:17:57,857 --> 01:17:59,026
- What did you get?
- I have green.

2223
01:17:59,027 --> 01:18:00,727
- Your number. Got it.
- I got two.

2224
01:18:03,457 --> 01:18:05,557
Se Yoon, Sae Ho, and Joon are on the other team.

2225
01:18:06,127 --> 01:18:08,466
This isn't that bad, Jong Min.

2226
01:18:08,467 --> 01:18:09,796
Seon Ho is a little...

2227
01:18:09,797 --> 01:18:12,336
- It's not bad.
- Listen to me.

2228
01:18:12,337 --> 01:18:13,966
They say we're going to somewhere cool.

2229
01:18:13,967 --> 01:18:16,137
I think it could be an ice rink.

2230
01:18:16,277 --> 01:18:17,976
That's what I'm good at.

2231
01:18:17,977 --> 01:18:20,507
- I see.
- What are you good at?

2232
01:18:20,607 --> 01:18:21,976
I've been skating since I was little.

2233
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:24,076
- Skating.
- You skated a lot?

2234
01:18:24,077 --> 01:18:26,947
Then I should twist your ankles.

2235
01:18:27,187 --> 01:18:28,886
If it's an ice rink, you have me.

2236
01:18:28,887 --> 01:18:31,686
That's right. You know, he used to be a dancer.

2237
01:18:31,687 --> 01:18:33,656
- He has a good sense of balance.
- That's why I wanted you...

2238
01:18:33,657 --> 01:18:34,927
- on my team.
- Really?

2239
01:18:35,387 --> 01:18:37,096
Jong Hyun, it's an ice rink, right?

2240
01:18:37,097 --> 01:18:38,596
- You'll see.
- Okay.

2241
01:18:38,597 --> 01:18:40,266
There is an ice rink in this neighborhood?

2242
01:18:40,267 --> 01:18:41,297
It's not here.

2243
01:18:43,367 --> 01:18:45,496
He's right. There's an ice rink.

2244
01:18:45,497 --> 01:18:46,866
- Where?
- Seriously?

2245
01:18:46,867 --> 01:18:48,106
- You're right.
- How did you know?

2246
01:18:48,107 --> 01:18:50,007
- My gosh. That was true?
- What's with you?

2247
01:18:50,437 --> 01:18:52,076
Hey, how did you know that?

2248
01:18:52,077 --> 01:18:53,846
- I bet he saw something.
- Now...

2249
01:18:53,847 --> 01:18:55,006
- You saw something, right?
- No.

2250
01:18:55,007 --> 01:18:56,146
- I've been here the whole time.
- He was sitting here.

2251
01:18:56,147 --> 01:18:57,976
This doesn't make sense. How did you know that?

2252
01:18:57,977 --> 01:18:59,217
He said we'd go somewhere cool.

2253
01:18:59,987 --> 01:19:02,486
(He said it was a place that's less hot.)

2254
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:04,216
- No. I didn't hear anything.
- You're suspicious.

2255
01:19:04,217 --> 01:19:06,157
- Hanam.
- It'd be cool in the ice rink.

2256
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:09,156
- This is really nice.
- It's cold.

2257
01:19:09,157 --> 01:19:10,296
- It's too cold.
- It's so cool.

2258
01:19:10,297 --> 01:19:13,027
- It's cool.
- It's so cool. I love it.

2259
01:19:13,267 --> 01:19:14,896
It's hot and cold today.

2260
01:19:14,897 --> 01:19:16,096
It's really cold.

2261
01:19:16,097 --> 01:19:18,366
Please get changed first.

2262
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:19,767
Oh, no. We must change again.

2263
01:19:19,867 --> 01:19:21,906
What is this? I guess it's a hand-to-hand fight.

2264
01:19:21,907 --> 01:19:23,036
We have protective gear.

2265
01:19:23,037 --> 01:19:25,276
What? What is this?

2266
01:19:25,277 --> 01:19:26,707
I guess we're playing ice hockey.

2267
01:19:27,107 --> 01:19:30,347
I think it's something tough, seeing him giving us gear like this.

2268
01:19:30,647 --> 01:19:32,416
- This is...
- This is for a physical fight.

2269
01:19:32,417 --> 01:19:33,617
What is going on?

2270
01:19:33,787 --> 01:19:35,956
Are we doing something that tough?

2271
01:19:35,957 --> 01:19:37,687
Are we going to fight?

2272
01:19:38,617 --> 01:19:39,786
(After getting changed, they enter the ice rink.)

2273
01:19:39,787 --> 01:19:40,856
Can we go in like this?

2274
01:19:40,857 --> 01:19:43,397
- Why aren't you giving us skates?
- What?

2275
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:46,597
- We have something to do our way.
- I see.

2276
01:19:46,767 --> 01:19:49,367
I was excited to skate.

2277
01:19:49,537 --> 01:19:50,996
Please stand here, everyone.

2278
01:19:50,997 --> 01:19:52,706
- It's cool.
- Are we curling?

2279
01:19:52,707 --> 01:19:54,766
DinDin, let's go home.

2280
01:19:54,767 --> 01:19:55,936
Let's go!

2281
01:19:55,937 --> 01:19:57,006
(The leading team is burning with determination to go home.)

2282
01:19:57,007 --> 01:19:59,006
This getting-off-work game is...

2283
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:00,847
Hot Weather Sports Festival.

2284
01:20:01,507 --> 01:20:02,576
- Yes.
- Hot Weather Sports Festival.

2285
01:20:02,577 --> 01:20:03,916
It's a 3-on-3 team competition.

2286
01:20:03,917 --> 01:20:05,377
There will be two rounds.

2287
01:20:05,547 --> 01:20:06,646
That sounds nice.

2288
01:20:06,647 --> 01:20:08,186
After each round,

2289
01:20:08,187 --> 01:20:10,957
the winning team and losing team will receive...

2290
01:20:11,117 --> 01:20:12,587
- different dice.
- I see.

2291
01:20:13,787 --> 01:20:16,926
If you win, you get a die that has numbers 1, 2, and 3.

2292
01:20:16,927 --> 01:20:17,996
If we win?

2293
01:20:17,997 --> 01:20:20,077
If you lose, you get a die that has numbers 1 and 0.

2294
01:20:21,197 --> 01:20:22,936
- If we win both rounds, - Yes?

2295
01:20:22,937 --> 01:20:24,857
- can we get number three twice?
- That's right.

2296
01:20:24,897 --> 01:20:26,966
- It will be almost over then.
- You can move a lot.

2297
01:20:26,967 --> 01:20:29,436
(He's already imagining himself in his bedroom.)

2298
01:20:29,437 --> 01:20:31,936
- You guys are dead!
- All right.

2299
01:20:31,937 --> 01:20:34,376
- All right. Here's Round 1.
- Round 1.

2300
01:20:34,377 --> 01:20:36,046
It's Ice Pushing.

2301
01:20:36,047 --> 01:20:37,576
- Ice Pushing?
- Yes.

2302
01:20:37,577 --> 01:20:39,846
Each team takes turns...

2303
01:20:39,847 --> 01:20:41,346
doing a knee slide.

2304
01:20:41,347 --> 01:20:43,916
The team with the member who lands...

2305
01:20:43,917 --> 01:20:46,186
- closest to the center wins.
- It's like curling.

2306
01:20:46,187 --> 01:20:47,386
After you're done sliding,

2307
01:20:47,387 --> 01:20:49,756
you're not allowed to move.

2308
01:20:49,757 --> 01:20:52,126
- Right. That's a foul.
- You can't move from your spot.

2309
01:20:52,127 --> 01:20:53,566
- After you stop.
- Okay.

2310
01:20:53,567 --> 01:20:55,367
We should come up with some ground rules.

2311
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:57,336
Can we push each other when we are close?

2312
01:20:57,337 --> 01:21:00,066
Or are we not supposed to push others before we touch each other?

2313
01:21:00,067 --> 01:21:01,766
For example, is it okay to push like this?

2314
01:21:01,767 --> 01:21:03,036
- Let's try it.
- Let's give it a try.

2315
01:21:03,037 --> 01:21:04,636
- Try pushing me.
- Just do it.

2316
01:21:04,637 --> 01:21:05,807
If I go like this...

2317
01:21:07,707 --> 01:21:09,316
- That's okay.
- It's acceptable.

2318
01:21:09,317 --> 01:21:10,417
How about this?

2319
01:21:11,577 --> 01:21:12,616
(Obviously, it's a foul.)

2320
01:21:12,617 --> 01:21:14,687
- No, you can't do that.
- No.

2321
01:21:17,787 --> 01:21:19,156
(Startled)

2322
01:21:19,157 --> 01:21:20,856
(The end of the foul king)

2323
01:21:20,857 --> 01:21:22,356
What I did with Seon Ho is good.

2324
01:21:22,357 --> 01:21:24,026
- Okay.
- That much. Okay. Got it.

2325
01:21:24,027 --> 01:21:26,266
- I want to push, though.
- Okay. Let's hold back.

2326
01:21:26,267 --> 01:21:27,567
They won't accept it.

2327
01:21:29,267 --> 01:21:32,667
(The 1st 2 Days 1 Night's Cup, Ice Pushing Match)

2328
01:21:32,867 --> 01:21:34,266
We will play rock-paper-scissors.

2329
01:21:34,267 --> 01:21:35,876
We will play rock-paper-scissors.

2330
01:21:35,877 --> 01:21:37,836
Rock-paper-scissors.

2331
01:21:37,837 --> 01:21:38,837
Okay.

2332
01:21:38,838 --> 01:21:40,077
We will go second.

2333
01:21:40,477 --> 01:21:41,477
Okay.

2334
01:21:41,478 --> 01:21:43,646
- I think you should go 1st.
- No, you go 1st.

2335
01:21:43,647 --> 01:21:44,846
We're at an advantage.

2336
01:21:44,847 --> 01:21:46,946
You just need to push everyone away at the end.

2337
01:21:46,947 --> 01:21:49,216
Just slide hard and crush everyone.

2338
01:21:49,217 --> 01:21:50,686
I'll try to get to the center. I'm the last.

2339
01:21:50,687 --> 01:21:52,016
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2340
01:21:52,017 --> 01:21:53,626
Player One. Please start.

2341
01:21:53,627 --> 01:21:54,726
Player One. Okay.

2342
01:21:54,727 --> 01:21:56,426
- The red circle. In front of it.
- Okay.

2343
01:21:56,427 --> 01:21:57,556
- The red one.
- Okay.

2344
01:21:57,557 --> 01:21:59,426
- Here I go.
- You should do well.

2345
01:21:59,427 --> 01:22:02,197
Okay. Let me start. Here I go.

2346
01:22:04,467 --> 01:22:06,436
(Sliding)

2347
01:22:06,437 --> 01:22:08,036
- What's with you?
- What are you doing?

2348
01:22:08,037 --> 01:22:09,207
(Turning slightly)

2349
01:22:09,407 --> 01:22:10,607
(Glancing)

2350
01:22:11,007 --> 01:22:13,807
(He's not supposed to move, but he commits a foul.)

2351
01:22:14,107 --> 01:22:15,206
(Laughing)

2352
01:22:15,207 --> 01:22:16,516
Come here.

2353
01:22:16,517 --> 01:22:18,076
- Why?
- Mister.

2354
01:22:18,077 --> 01:22:19,946
- Should I do it again?
- No, we should continue.

2355
01:22:19,947 --> 01:22:21,586
You shouldn't move like that.

2356
01:22:21,587 --> 01:22:22,867
You can't turn around like that.

2357
01:22:22,917 --> 01:22:25,586
You were trying to be clever, but you can't turn around like that.

2358
01:22:25,587 --> 01:22:26,786
Just slide straight. Okay.

2359
01:22:26,787 --> 01:22:28,887
- Go straight.
- Okay. Here I go.

2360
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:30,856
- Here I go.
- With your hands behind your back.

2361
01:22:30,857 --> 01:22:31,857
(Determined)

2362
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:34,926
(Start)

2363
01:22:34,927 --> 01:22:37,036
(Jong Min)

2364
01:22:37,037 --> 01:22:39,136
- Lean back.
- Okay.

2365
01:22:39,137 --> 01:22:40,606
- Okay.
- Okay.

2366
01:22:40,607 --> 01:22:42,066
(He didn't even get near the center.)

2367
01:22:42,067 --> 01:22:43,837
- This is my strategy.
- Okay.

2368
01:22:44,077 --> 01:22:45,506
Jong Min, that's perfect.

2369
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:46,706
- It's perfect?
- Yes.

2370
01:22:46,707 --> 01:22:48,207
- I'll go next.
- He's going.

2371
01:22:49,107 --> 01:22:50,547
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2372
01:22:50,847 --> 01:22:52,476
(Quite determined)

2373
01:22:52,477 --> 01:22:53,887
We should block them.

2374
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:56,657
(Sliding powerfully)

2375
01:22:57,317 --> 01:22:59,226
(Trying to make a sudden stop)

2376
01:22:59,227 --> 01:23:00,586
(Jong Min, Sae Ho)

2377
01:23:00,587 --> 01:23:01,627
Good.

2378
01:23:02,187 --> 01:23:03,626
That's a lot better.

2379
01:23:03,627 --> 01:23:05,597
- You shouldn't move.
- This is where I stopped.

2380
01:23:05,827 --> 01:23:07,397
Okay. We're winning now.

2381
01:23:08,627 --> 01:23:11,196
If it's possible, try to be closer to the center than Sae Ho.

2382
01:23:11,197 --> 01:23:12,267
All right.

2383
01:23:12,497 --> 01:23:13,906
- I'll go next.
- Okay.

2384
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:15,113
(DinDin of Team Jong Min is up.)

2385
01:23:15,137 --> 01:23:16,607
The ice melted a lot.

2386
01:23:24,117 --> 01:23:25,146
(Colliding)

2387
01:23:25,147 --> 01:23:26,147
Good.

2388
01:23:26,148 --> 01:23:27,586
(He got attacked.)

2389
01:23:27,587 --> 01:23:29,916
You should be on the spot where your feet are placed.

2390
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:31,317
Over there.

2391
01:23:31,687 --> 01:23:32,826
Your feet were out of the circle.

2392
01:23:32,827 --> 01:23:34,726
Mister, your knees were out of the circle.

2393
01:23:34,727 --> 01:23:36,826
- Go farther back.
- Your knees were out.

2394
01:23:36,827 --> 01:23:37,927
Move.

2395
01:23:38,127 --> 01:23:39,926
He should be turned around here.

2396
01:23:39,927 --> 01:23:41,297
This is not bad.

2397
01:23:41,797 --> 01:23:43,396
Let's leave it to chance now.

2398
01:23:43,397 --> 01:23:45,066
How are you going to do it?

2399
01:23:45,067 --> 01:23:47,536
I'll try to land in front of Jong Min.

2400
01:23:47,537 --> 01:23:49,277
- In front of Jong Min?
- Yes.

2401
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:50,636
Let's go.

2402
01:23:50,637 --> 01:23:52,106
(Nervous)

2403
01:23:52,107 --> 01:23:53,777
- Good luck, Joon.
- Okay.

2404
01:23:54,647 --> 01:23:55,647
Go, Joon.

2405
01:23:55,747 --> 01:23:58,546
(Sliding toward the center with great determination)

2406
01:23:58,547 --> 01:24:00,346
- Good.
- It's too long.

2407
01:24:00,347 --> 01:24:02,686
- Hey, you should lean back.
- Okay. He's going over.

2408
01:24:02,687 --> 01:24:04,256
- He went out!
- Okay!

2409
01:24:04,257 --> 01:24:06,786
(Lee Joon, DinDin)

2410
01:24:06,787 --> 01:24:08,963
(He failed to control his power and narrowly missed the center.)

2411
01:24:08,987 --> 01:24:11,697
(If we keep going like this, we will win.)

2412
01:24:11,897 --> 01:24:13,897
- Lee Joon is out!
- It's a miss.

2413
01:24:14,067 --> 01:24:15,787
- Gosh, that was so close.
- This is crazy.

2414
01:24:17,037 --> 01:24:19,936
Everyone, DinDin is currently closest to the center.

2415
01:24:19,937 --> 01:24:22,136
- Okay.
- You can't get the right angle.

2416
01:24:22,137 --> 01:24:23,607
I think I can make it.

2417
01:24:23,837 --> 01:24:25,277
I'll go to the center.

2418
01:24:25,907 --> 01:24:27,007
Here I go.

2419
01:24:27,677 --> 01:24:31,416
(Seon Ho talked big, saying that he'd be good on the ice.)

2420
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:34,986
(Will he be able to seal the win?)

2421
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:37,316
- That's too fast.
- Stop.

2422
01:24:37,317 --> 01:24:38,816
- Okay.
- Okay.

2423
01:24:38,817 --> 01:24:40,157
This is good, Se Yoon.

2424
01:24:40,687 --> 01:24:42,927
(Telling him to stop urgently)

2425
01:24:43,627 --> 01:24:45,356
(Attacking his team member)

2426
01:24:45,357 --> 01:24:47,096
- This is good, Se Yoon.
- That was too hard.

2427
01:24:47,097 --> 01:24:49,226
You pushed me out.

2428
01:24:49,227 --> 01:24:50,336
(You said you'd be good!)

2429
01:24:50,337 --> 01:24:51,366
Go farther back.

2430
01:24:51,367 --> 01:24:52,536
(Despite the teamkill, Team Jong Min is still winning.)

2431
01:24:52,537 --> 01:24:53,736
You were farther behind.

2432
01:24:53,737 --> 01:24:54,737
Here I go.

2433
01:24:54,738 --> 01:24:56,776
- I'll just go quietly.
- Stay quiet.

2434
01:24:56,777 --> 01:24:58,607
(The fate of both teams rests on Se Yoon.)

2435
01:24:58,807 --> 01:25:01,647
(Will he be able to get closer to the center than Seon Ho?)

2436
01:25:01,907 --> 01:25:03,777
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2437
01:25:04,477 --> 01:25:06,787
(Determined)

2438
01:25:06,817 --> 01:25:09,817
Moon Se Yoon! Fatty Moon!

2439
01:25:10,357 --> 01:25:13,256
(How will it go?)

2440
01:25:13,257 --> 01:25:15,226
(Se Yoon's camera)

2441
01:25:15,227 --> 01:25:18,426
(Getting closer to the target)

2442
01:25:18,427 --> 01:25:20,567
(Extremely nervous)

2443
01:25:20,997 --> 01:25:23,466
(Which team will win Round 1?)

2444
01:25:23,467 --> 01:25:26,166
(Please)

2445
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:28,506
Fatty Moon!

2446
01:25:28,507 --> 01:25:30,007
It's over.

2447
01:25:32,907 --> 01:25:35,506
- Okay!
- Yes!

2448
01:25:35,507 --> 01:25:39,716
(Se Yoon, Seon Ho)

2449
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:42,486
(He successfully landed closer to the center.)

2450
01:25:42,487 --> 01:25:43,557
We win!

2451
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:49,926
(Let's go home today!)

2452
01:25:49,927 --> 01:25:51,556
We did it!

2453
01:25:51,557 --> 01:25:53,366
Why did you not stop?

2454
01:25:53,367 --> 01:25:55,597
I couldn't stop here because the ice was slippery.

2455
01:25:55,967 --> 01:25:58,196
Here's the result of Round One, Ice Pushing.

2456
01:25:58,197 --> 01:25:59,837
Team Se Yoon wins.

2457
01:26:00,967 --> 01:26:02,737
(Teasing them)

2458
01:26:02,937 --> 01:26:04,736
(Upset)

2459
01:26:04,737 --> 01:26:05,977
Let's go!

2460
01:26:06,377 --> 01:26:08,806
We will hurry and set up the next game.

2461
01:26:08,807 --> 01:26:10,327
- Let's go.
- What are we going to do?

2462
01:26:10,647 --> 01:26:12,116
- Everyone.
- Your energy...

2463
01:26:12,117 --> 01:26:13,547
The Round Two mission is...

2464
01:26:14,247 --> 01:26:16,516
Ice Running on Knees.

2465
01:26:16,517 --> 01:26:17,916
- Knees?
- I see.

2466
01:26:17,917 --> 01:26:19,527
- Here?
- This is the lane.

2467
01:26:20,387 --> 01:26:23,396
You will run a lap on your knees.

2468
01:26:23,397 --> 01:26:24,926
The first one to arrive wins.

2469
01:26:24,927 --> 01:26:25,957
All right.

2470
01:26:26,367 --> 01:26:27,867
That's it, Seon Ho.

2471
01:26:29,367 --> 01:26:30,467
I can't touch the ground.

2472
01:26:33,037 --> 01:26:35,637
- Hey, this is really hard.
- I can't do this.

2473
01:26:36,577 --> 01:26:38,706
(Moving fast)

2474
01:26:38,707 --> 01:26:40,476
- What? He's really fast.
- He's fast.

2475
01:26:40,477 --> 01:26:41,507
(Keeping him in check)

2476
01:26:42,277 --> 01:26:45,677
(Motivated by DinDin, Joon keeps practicing.)

2477
01:26:46,487 --> 01:26:50,117
You can go faster if you walk while lifting your knees.

2478
01:26:50,987 --> 01:26:52,756
(He shares his secret with the team members.)

2479
01:26:52,757 --> 01:26:53,826
- Really?
- Yes.

2480
01:26:53,827 --> 01:26:55,527
All right. Set the order first.

2481
01:26:55,857 --> 01:26:57,356
An individual game? Or is it a relay race?

2482
01:26:57,357 --> 01:26:58,996
There will be 3 1-on-1 individual matches.

2483
01:26:58,997 --> 01:27:00,826
It's the best of three games.

2484
01:27:00,827 --> 01:27:02,327
For this, the order is important.

2485
01:27:03,397 --> 01:27:04,966
(They start discussing the order seriously.)

2486
01:27:04,967 --> 01:27:05,967
Should I go first?

2487
01:27:06,307 --> 01:27:07,766
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

2488
01:27:07,767 --> 01:27:09,366
- I'll go 2nd.
- I'll go 2nd. You're the last.

2489
01:27:09,367 --> 01:27:10,676
- That's too much pressure.
- Do you know why?

2490
01:27:10,677 --> 01:27:13,277
You're the only one who hasn't started yet.

2491
01:27:13,507 --> 01:27:15,206
So you should try really hard.

2492
01:27:15,207 --> 01:27:16,616
You two should win then.

2493
01:27:16,617 --> 01:27:17,977
- That will be the best.
- Okay.

2494
01:27:18,647 --> 01:27:20,187
Please write down the order.

2495
01:27:20,947 --> 01:27:23,057
(Practicing hard)

2496
01:27:23,557 --> 01:27:24,587
Okay.

2497
01:27:25,417 --> 01:27:27,356
We don't care much about the order.

2498
01:27:27,357 --> 01:27:29,357
I'll go first.

2499
01:27:29,597 --> 01:27:31,456
No. I'm first.

2500
01:27:31,457 --> 01:27:33,466
(He says random words to avoid revealing their plan.)

2501
01:27:33,467 --> 01:27:35,126
- Okay.
- You should go last.

2502
01:27:35,127 --> 01:27:37,096
- Like this?
- No, we should do this.

2503
01:27:37,097 --> 01:27:38,366
- Okay.
- It can't be helped.

2504
01:27:38,367 --> 01:27:39,806
- Me?
- Yes. Let's do that.

2505
01:27:39,807 --> 01:27:40,867
Okay.

2506
01:27:41,007 --> 01:27:43,507
- All right. I'm nervous.
- The first runners.

2507
01:27:44,207 --> 01:27:45,376
Sae Ho and DinDin.

2508
01:27:45,377 --> 01:27:46,377
(The 1st runners: Sae Ho versus DinDin)

2509
01:27:46,378 --> 01:27:48,346
All right. The second runners.

2510
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:49,376
- Okay.
- Jong Min.

2511
01:27:49,377 --> 01:27:51,247
- Joon and Jong Min.
- Good.

2512
01:27:51,617 --> 01:27:54,717
The third runners. Se Yoon and Seon Ho.

2513
01:27:55,387 --> 01:27:56,586
- My gosh.
- The third runners.

2514
01:27:56,587 --> 01:27:58,757
- It's not bad.
- Se Yoon and Seon Ho.

2515
01:27:59,057 --> 01:28:00,386
- Okay.
- First, Joon.

2516
01:28:00,387 --> 01:28:01,556
We will win at least one match.

2517
01:28:01,557 --> 01:28:03,126
It's Jong Min, so you'll win. You need to do well.

2518
01:28:03,127 --> 01:28:05,727
What matters now is the inner lane and the outer lane.

2519
01:28:06,467 --> 01:28:07,773
We should play rock-paper-scissors.

2520
01:28:07,797 --> 01:28:08,997
Play rock-paper-scissors.

2521
01:28:09,097 --> 01:28:10,637
What will you play?

2522
01:28:11,367 --> 01:28:12,396
- I'll play...
- Rock?

2523
01:28:12,397 --> 01:28:14,166
- I'll play rock.
- Rock?

2524
01:28:14,167 --> 01:28:15,407
- I'll play rock.
- Okay.

2525
01:28:15,537 --> 01:28:16,706
Rock-paper-scissors!

2526
01:28:16,707 --> 01:28:18,336
(Scissors, Actual rock)

2527
01:28:18,337 --> 01:28:19,707
That's huge.

2528
01:28:19,947 --> 01:28:21,947
Getting the inner lane is a huge deal.

2529
01:28:22,307 --> 01:28:23,716
Oh, dear. He did play rock.

2530
01:28:23,717 --> 01:28:25,146
(Sighing)

2531
01:28:25,147 --> 01:28:27,816
It's the 1st time he did as he said in 6 years.

2532
01:28:27,817 --> 01:28:29,816
Getting the inner lane is everything.

2533
01:28:29,817 --> 01:28:31,586
Okay. I'll stay as close as possible.

2534
01:28:31,587 --> 01:28:33,386
- No!
- What are you doing?

2535
01:28:33,387 --> 01:28:35,326
- You can't be here.
- This is dangerous!

2536
01:28:35,327 --> 01:28:36,596
(Stay away!)

2537
01:28:36,597 --> 01:28:38,927
(It's a mess even before they start.)

2538
01:28:39,327 --> 01:28:41,127
(Se Yoon gets involved.)

2539
01:28:41,927 --> 01:28:43,236
That's the outer lane.

2540
01:28:43,237 --> 01:28:45,066
- You can't do that!
- Don't touch my teammate.

2541
01:28:45,067 --> 01:28:47,306
- Keep the lanes separate.
- Don't touch him. Stay away.

2542
01:28:47,307 --> 01:28:48,636
- Is there a problem?
- No.

2543
01:28:48,637 --> 01:28:49,807
What's the problem?

2544
01:28:50,307 --> 01:28:52,976
(Why are they arguing? Do they want to go home that much?)

2545
01:28:52,977 --> 01:28:54,946
- Hold your arm up like this.
- Do we do this?

2546
01:28:54,947 --> 01:28:56,716
Put both arms up.

2547
01:28:56,717 --> 01:28:58,816
This is the first race!

2548
01:28:58,817 --> 01:28:59,847
(Race 1 begins at last.)

2549
01:29:01,287 --> 01:29:03,617
(I'm Cho Sae Ho.)

2550
01:29:04,157 --> 01:29:07,087
(I fear what the awful night will be.)

2551
01:29:08,127 --> 01:29:10,597
(I'm DinDin.)

2552
01:29:10,897 --> 01:29:14,197
(I know the joy of going home on the same day.)

2553
01:29:15,067 --> 01:29:17,737
(Who will grab the flag of victory first?)

2554
01:29:18,097 --> 01:29:20,667
Let's go! You can do this. You can.

2555
01:29:21,007 --> 01:29:23,437
- Ready.
- Let's do it!

2556
01:29:23,937 --> 01:29:25,137
Set.

2557
01:29:26,647 --> 01:29:27,707
Let's go!

2558
01:29:29,377 --> 01:29:30,377
Let's go!

2559
01:29:30,378 --> 01:29:32,447
- Okay. They're moving.
- He's ahead.

2560
01:29:33,187 --> 01:29:34,187
(It's close.)

2561
01:29:34,188 --> 01:29:35,517
You're both in it!

2562
01:29:36,117 --> 01:29:38,557
(I can catch up!)

2563
01:29:39,557 --> 01:29:41,087
You can do it.

2564
01:29:41,727 --> 01:29:42,956
(DinDin)

2565
01:29:42,957 --> 01:29:44,257
You're both in it!

2566
01:29:44,557 --> 01:29:45,597
Watch out.

2567
01:29:47,297 --> 01:29:50,566
(DinDin loses his balance.)

2568
01:29:50,567 --> 01:29:52,297
(He slips again.)

2569
01:29:52,967 --> 01:29:54,967
Keep going. Watch your hand.

2570
01:29:55,867 --> 01:29:57,236
Keep going. Watch your hand.

2571
01:29:57,237 --> 01:29:59,537
DinDin, come into the inner lane.

2572
01:30:00,207 --> 01:30:01,476
(Sae Ho, grab the opportunity.)

2573
01:30:01,477 --> 01:30:02,947
You can do it.

2574
01:30:03,277 --> 01:30:04,346
(DinDin)

2575
01:30:04,347 --> 01:30:07,217
(DinDin slipped away from the course.)

2576
01:30:08,947 --> 01:30:11,216
Either of you can win!

2577
01:30:11,217 --> 01:30:13,057
(Powering up)

2578
01:30:14,627 --> 01:30:16,796
- He's catching up.
- Keep going. Watch your hand.

2579
01:30:16,797 --> 01:30:18,396
Yes, DinDin!

2580
01:30:18,397 --> 01:30:19,426
The inner lane.

2581
01:30:19,427 --> 01:30:20,526
(Clenching his teeth under the pressure)

2582
01:30:20,527 --> 01:30:22,326
(DinDin, Sae Ho)

2583
01:30:22,327 --> 01:30:23,736
(DinDin barely secures the inner lane.)

2584
01:30:23,737 --> 01:30:25,137
No, it's still okay.

2585
01:30:26,297 --> 01:30:28,966
(DinDin races ahead.)

2586
01:30:28,967 --> 01:30:30,047
(Exclaiming in frustration)

2587
01:30:30,807 --> 01:30:31,807
Darn it.

2588
01:30:32,007 --> 01:30:34,447
(He used all his energy to pass DinDin.)

2589
01:30:34,907 --> 01:30:35,907
(Relaxed front teeth)

2590
01:30:35,908 --> 01:30:36,947
DinDin's fast.

2591
01:30:37,247 --> 01:30:38,746
- DinDin's fast.
- You're there.

2592
01:30:38,747 --> 01:30:39,886
He got it.

2593
01:30:39,887 --> 01:30:41,746
(Oh, Sae Ho...)

2594
01:30:41,747 --> 01:30:43,286
(Sae Ho, DinDin)

2595
01:30:43,287 --> 01:30:44,456
Okay, DinDin!

2596
01:30:44,457 --> 01:30:46,826
(DinDin crosses the finish line.)

2597
01:30:46,827 --> 01:30:47,886
(Team Jong Min's DinDin wins.)

2598
01:30:47,887 --> 01:30:49,587
Things got really bad when...

2599
01:30:50,657 --> 01:30:51,696
No.

2600
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:53,696
(Sae Ho grimaced in pain...)

2601
01:30:53,697 --> 01:30:57,337
(and fell as soon as the race ended.)

2602
01:30:57,697 --> 01:30:59,237
Let's push him out of the way.

2603
01:31:01,237 --> 01:31:02,266
My back hurts so much.

2604
01:31:02,267 --> 01:31:03,337
(My back hurts so much.)

2605
01:31:03,637 --> 01:31:04,637
(He's out anyway.)

2606
01:31:04,638 --> 01:31:05,807
Let's get him out.

2607
01:31:08,077 --> 01:31:09,716
You can't do anything.

2608
01:31:09,717 --> 01:31:11,147
(The loser's fate)

2609
01:31:11,447 --> 01:31:12,947
- What happened?
- It's hard.

2610
01:31:13,187 --> 01:31:14,823
- It's impossible?
- I couldn't go forward.

2611
01:31:14,847 --> 01:31:17,086
Race One ended...

2612
01:31:17,087 --> 01:31:18,616
- in DinDin's victory.
- Okay. Thanks, DinDin.

2613
01:31:18,617 --> 01:31:20,626
Can the next participants step forward?

2614
01:31:20,627 --> 01:31:22,133
If you win on the inner course, it's over.

2615
01:31:22,157 --> 01:31:23,497
Rock-paper-scissors.

2616
01:31:23,597 --> 01:31:24,626
Okay, the inner lane.

2617
01:31:24,627 --> 01:31:25,627
Let's go.

2618
01:31:26,097 --> 01:31:28,497
(Joon secured the inner lane.)

2619
01:31:28,527 --> 01:31:29,627
Okay, the inner lane.

2620
01:31:30,237 --> 01:31:32,597
- It's okay. You can manage.
- I'll give you a shot.

2621
01:31:33,507 --> 01:31:35,736
If you dig in the moment the race starts,

2622
01:31:35,737 --> 01:31:37,277
- you can win.
- Okay.

2623
01:31:37,337 --> 01:31:38,576
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2624
01:31:38,577 --> 01:31:40,147
Jong Min, win for me.

2625
01:31:40,307 --> 01:31:41,347
So I don't have to race.

2626
01:31:42,107 --> 01:31:43,676
All right. Ready.

2627
01:31:43,677 --> 01:31:46,217
(Seon Ho, I'll end the race for you.)

2628
01:31:46,787 --> 01:31:49,987
(Joon, it's over if you lose.)

2629
01:31:50,587 --> 01:31:53,657
(I'll win at all costs.)

2630
01:31:54,187 --> 01:31:58,127
(Neither of them can give in.)

2631
01:31:58,697 --> 01:31:59,727
Set.

2632
01:32:02,497 --> 01:32:03,537
Set.

2633
01:32:03,737 --> 01:32:05,436
(A false start)

2634
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:06,636
Darn it.

2635
01:32:06,637 --> 01:32:07,766
Set.

2636
01:32:07,767 --> 01:32:09,136
(100 percent tension)

2637
01:32:09,137 --> 01:32:12,037
(0 percent tension)

2638
01:32:12,477 --> 01:32:14,506
(Perplexed)

2639
01:32:14,507 --> 01:32:16,977
- What was that?
- That's so sad.

2640
01:32:17,317 --> 01:32:19,647
He's serious about going home early.

2641
01:32:20,187 --> 01:32:22,546
Jong Min, do that one more time,

2642
01:32:22,547 --> 01:32:23,757
and you restart after a slap.

2643
01:32:24,487 --> 01:32:26,056
He deserves that.

2644
01:32:26,057 --> 01:32:27,657
I apologize.

2645
01:32:28,327 --> 01:32:30,327
Okay. Let's do this!

2646
01:32:30,927 --> 01:32:32,397
Ready.

2647
01:32:33,027 --> 01:32:34,167
Set.

2648
01:32:36,497 --> 01:32:37,497
What...

2649
01:32:38,767 --> 01:32:40,037
(Move, Jong Min.)

2650
01:32:41,137 --> 01:32:43,977
(Joon takes the lead right away.)

2651
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,077
What a shame.

2652
01:32:48,547 --> 01:32:50,146
You can do it!

2653
01:32:50,147 --> 01:32:52,376
- You can do it!
- There's a good gap.

2654
01:32:52,377 --> 01:32:54,417
- You can do it! Don't give up!
- Watch your pace.

2655
01:32:55,017 --> 01:32:56,717
(I'm Lee Joon. I don't watch my pace!)

2656
01:32:57,187 --> 01:32:58,187
(Hop 1)

2657
01:32:58,787 --> 01:32:59,787
(Hop 2)

2658
01:33:00,757 --> 01:33:03,457
(He runs at the risk of ruining his knees.)

2659
01:33:03,957 --> 01:33:05,056
(A crazy spurt)

2660
01:33:05,057 --> 01:33:06,057
Don't give up.

2661
01:33:06,058 --> 01:33:07,127
He's doing great.

2662
01:33:08,397 --> 01:33:11,967
(This guy's racing with his face.)

2663
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:14,237
You can do it! Don't give up!

2664
01:33:14,867 --> 01:33:16,137
Don't give up.

2665
01:33:17,007 --> 01:33:19,847
(But Joon extends the gap.)

2666
01:33:20,507 --> 01:33:23,346
(He's getting farther away...)

2667
01:33:23,347 --> 01:33:25,177
I said don't give up!

2668
01:33:26,477 --> 01:33:27,486
Don't give up.

2669
01:33:27,487 --> 01:33:28,546
He's doing great.

2670
01:33:28,547 --> 01:33:30,187
(Joon's too fast for him not to give up.)

2671
01:33:30,487 --> 01:33:31,816
Okay!

2672
01:33:31,817 --> 01:33:32,856
(Joon crosses the finish line.)

2673
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,457
Joon was incredible.

2674
01:33:35,457 --> 01:33:38,827
(Feeling lost)

2675
01:33:40,827 --> 01:33:44,766
(Team Se Yoon's Joon wins.)

2676
01:33:44,767 --> 01:33:46,737
(Next episode)

2677
01:33:47,407 --> 01:33:50,607
(The race to go home is still on.)

2678
01:33:51,477 --> 01:33:53,807
(For an incredible privilege of going home early, )

2679
01:33:54,177 --> 01:33:56,307
(the members fight fiercely.)

2680
01:33:56,617 --> 01:33:58,247
(It's too early to give up.)

2681
01:33:58,717 --> 01:34:00,487
(Should it be this close?)

2682
01:34:01,187 --> 01:34:03,287
(If you want to go home today, )

2683
01:34:03,857 --> 01:34:06,457
(you must give it your all.)

2684
01:34:06,657 --> 01:34:07,657
Is it possible to sweat this much?

2685
01:34:07,658 --> 01:34:11,656
(Let me go home.)

2686
01:34:11,657 --> 01:34:14,127
(The bloody race is pretty much even.)

2687
01:34:14,967 --> 01:34:18,267
(Who will be the first to go home early?)

2688
01:34:19,537 --> 01:34:22,267
(See you on Sunday night at 6:10pm.)
