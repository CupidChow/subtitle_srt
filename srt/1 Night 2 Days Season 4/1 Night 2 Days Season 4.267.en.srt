1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,240
(KBS Hall)

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,540
(2 Days and 1 Night Feast)

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,080
(Final Round)

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,980
What's this?

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,620
What is this?

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,250
(They're faced
with mysterious installations.)

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,160
- It's the last round.
- The last round.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,420
- It's the last round.
- Yes.

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,920
(This is where they decide
who sleeps where.)

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,160
Let's end this.

11
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,330
The crew prepared
a great deal for us.

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,400
(Here we go.)

13
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,700
- What was that?
- A warm-up.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,100
- A warm-up.
- A warm-up.

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,170
Most comedians
seem to be able to do that.

16
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,140
(He even does a side-spin.)

17
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,740
Can you do that on this?

18
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,910
My gosh.

19
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,380
Can you do that here?

20
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
- What?
- No way.

21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,510
That's too much even for Im Woo 17.

22
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,580
Are you enjoying
the 2 Days and 1 Night Feast?

23
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,050
- Yes.
- Yes.

24
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,190
We must decide the winners
of Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

25
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,420
- It's the last game.
- It's the last round.

26
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,720
- That's all that's left.
- The last round.

27
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
Okay.

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,430
The final round is called...

29
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,860
Waddle Relay.

30
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,700
- A relay.
- We must run.

31
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,300
In costume, you must run...

32
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,230
around the obstacle course.

33
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,300
The next runner can set off...

34
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,200
once the previous runner tags them.

35
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,010
The first four runners
only do half a lap.

36
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,010
Okay.

37
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,010
(The first 4 runners
run half a lap.)

38
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,040
Runners 5 and 6 run 1 lap.

39
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,050
Okay.

40
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,220
(They must get through
each obstacle.)

41
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,380
The team...

42
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,290
whose last runner
crosses the finish line first wins.

43
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,090
- It's a relay.
- Okay.

44
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,120
Set it up, please.

45
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,360
- Something this big.
- You do half a lap.

46
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,590
- Oh, that?
- That?

47
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,760
Is it from that comedy sketch?

48
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,230
- What is this?
- From years ago. You know, right?

49
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,260
(The costumes are brought in.)

50
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,430
They make us waddle.

51
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,100
I watched this show as a kid.

52
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,370
I haven't seen this in so long.

53
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,300
This is going to be tough.

54
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,210
Oh, dear.

55
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,570
It's hard to put on.

56
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,940
(It's hard to even stay upright!)

57
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,140
Am I the only one who can't do this?

58
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,710
I can't walk in this.

59
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,050
You have to hop.
You can only do this.

60
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,620
How about this?

61
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,750
Isn't that walking normally?

62
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,160
No, my knees are inside.

63
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,290
Like this. Won't this do?

64
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,360
(Jong Min found a loophole.)

65
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,360
- It's quite comfortable.
- No.

66
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,430
(His partner has
second-hand embarrassment.)

67
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,570
Look at this. We need a rule.

68
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,130
- Just a bit...
- Don't do what Jong Min's doing.

69
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,200
Don't do this.

70
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,300
- The knees...
- This is a foul.

71
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,500
- We can't do this?
- No.

72
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,640
The knees...

73
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,670
- This is a foul.
- can't show, right?

74
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,670
- Right.
- We must do this.
- I can do this.
- Right?

75
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,180
- We just have to stick to this.
- You can't do that.

76
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,910
- Isn't this okay?
- Come on, Jong Min.

77
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,210
Let's all take your place.

78
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,250
- Where's the starting line?
- It's over here.

79
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,450
- Is this it?
- Yes.

80
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,750
Who are the first runners?

81
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,050
Se Yoon is number one?

82
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,150
(1st runners: Se Yoon, Jong Min)

83
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,360
- Who are the second runners?
- I'm the second.

84
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,820
SHUHUA is number three.

85
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,430
Number three.

86
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,890
- Number 4.
- Number 4.

87
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,430
- Hang on.
- Who's number four?

88
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,860
- Number 5.
- Number 5.

89
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,730
Number 5. Number 6?

90
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,000
(The last runners are...)

91
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,500
- Number six.
- The aces.

92
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,670
(Last runners: Joon, Dex)

93
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,740
My gosh.

94
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,870
The first runners will play
rock-paper-scissors.

95
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,640
Rock-paper-scissors
to pick the course.

96
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,040
Rock-paper-scissors.

97
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,750
(The team on the inside
has an advantage.)

98
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,450
Be a nice person
and give us the inside lane.

99
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,420
It's too much for me. I weigh 123kg.

100
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,850
Jong Min was never nice.

101
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,250
I'm not a nice person.

102
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,360
(He's a tomato
that gave up being human.)

103
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,190
- This decides where we sleep.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

104
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,630
- See? Go.
- You stay here.

105
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,490
Good luck.

106
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,500
(He pretends to be nice
after he lost.)

107
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,830
(Joon tests the acupressure pad.)

108
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,000
This is the decider.
It's really painful.

109
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,700
Hang on.

110
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,140
The acupressure pad.
I tried it briefly, and it hurts.

111
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,270
- We walk on the acupressure pad?
- Yes.

112
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,340
You must walk across.

113
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,640
- Let's go!
- Okay.

114
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,480
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

115
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,810
- Jong Min. Good luck.
- Good luck.

116
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,050
- Let's go!
- Good luck!

117
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,350
(Weakness)

118
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,950
(He can't stand the pain.)

119
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,360
Is Se Yoon better at this than most?

120
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,490
He's useless.

121
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,160
He's as bad at it as Jong Min.

122
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,830
Jong Min.
It's harder for Se Yoon than you.

123
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,330
He must fight double the gravity.

124
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,630
(Weakness: His weight)

125
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,300
Are you all ready?

126
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,340
(A close race
between the two vegetables.)

127
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,040
Jong Min. You need to do well.

128
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,840
- Are you ready? Ready!
- Let's go!

129
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,710
- Do your best!
- Let's play fair.

130
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,980
- Then let go.
- Let's play fair.

131
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,240
Are you ready? Get set...

132
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,310
(The relay...)

133
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,450
(starts.)

134
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,510
Go!

135
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,320
(The two set off running.)

136
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
- Se Yoon's doing well.
- Go!

137
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,350
- He's fast.
- Oh, dear.

138
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,060
(They stop suddenly
as soon as they step onto the pad.)

139
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Wait!

140
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,360
You have to go!

141
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,030
It hurts so much!
I can't move at all!

142
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,070
Bear with it, Se Yoon!

143
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,400
(Se Yoon weighs 123kg.)

144
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,500
It's just...

145
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,170
I'm sorry, but...

146
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,010
this race is no fun at all!

147
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,710
- Go, Se Yoon!
- You're acting!

148
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,210
It hurts!

149
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,540
- I can't go.
- Keep going!

150
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,580
- Crawl on all fours!
- Hurry up!

151
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,610
(Crawl if you must!)

152
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,180
(We must crawl?)

153
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,780
- Hang on.
- My hands hurt too.

154
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,590
What are they doing?

155
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,290
- What is this?
- What are you doing?

156
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,860
- What are you doing?
- Are you bowing?

157
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,330
- My gosh.
- What are you doing?

158
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,260
What kind of race is this?

159
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,000
- Se Yoon.
- Jong Min! Just go!

160
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
- Run.
- Go.

161
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,530
- Jong Min, go.
- Run.

162
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,000
- Crouch and walk.
- Let's go!

163
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,070
(Taking a long stride)

164
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,870
Okay. Go a bit more.

165
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,040
- Crouch and walk.
- Let's go!

166
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,310
(The rotten potato plays rotten.)

167
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,380
You can't press on him
with your hand!

168
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,940
His hand!

169
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,350
(The tomato is being squeezed.)

170
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,450
You're being bad!

171
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,080
You can do this!

172
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,250
- You can do this!
- Se Yoon!

173
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,580
- Se Yoon, look up.
- You can do this!

174
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,750
Run fast!

175
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,590
- My gosh.
- You need to do this for us.

176
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,860
You must do this
if we're to have a chance.

177
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,960
- Jong Min, you can win!
- Se Yoon, hang in there!

178
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,860
- Walk fast!
- That's it.

179
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,900
- Okay.
- You can do it.

180
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,900
(But...)

181
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,370
Okay.

182
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,300
- What's that?
- That's a foul.

183
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,600
He's showing too much leg.

184
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,040
- You must crouch lower.
- Go further down.

185
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,210
(Make a foul
and suffer the consequences.)

186
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,040
(This is the most shameful race
we ever saw.)

187
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,110
- Keep going!
- Go on.

188
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,550
- Jong Min, you're there.
- Almost.

189
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,880
- One last step!
- Let's go!

190
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,780
- Jump!
- My gosh.

191
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,880
Run!

192
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,520
- You have to go!
- No!

193
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,950
- Run.
- Run!

194
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,960
- Run.
- You can run.

195
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,990
- Hurry up!
- Se Yoon.

196
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,990
- Yes!
- Well done!

197
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,060
- Okay.
- Yes!

198
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,430
- Seon Ho!
- Okay!

199
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,500
- Okay.
- Well done!

200
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,600
(Team SHUHUA's 2nd runner
is Seon Ho.)

201
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,070
Seon Ho, you're fast!

202
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,600
- Okay!
- What's that?

203
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,900
- We're winning this.
- Come on!

204
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,270
Chang Hee is fast!

205
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,780
(Team SHUHUA is in the lead.)

206
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,880
Okay!

207
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,440
(Next up are SHUHUA and Han Na.)

208
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,180
- Come on!
- Seon Ho!

209
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,520
Okay! Go!

210
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,180
- Go, SHUHUA!
- Go!

211
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,590
- Go!
- SHUHUA!

212
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,220
(They're back
on the acupressure pad.)

213
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,620
- She's good.
- What is happening?

214
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,960
- How is she that good?
- Go!

215
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,690
Okay, go.

216
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,900
(Actually, SHUHUA...)

217
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,060
- What is that?
- SHUHUA!

218
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,260
It's easy.

219
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,730
Look at SHUHUA.

220
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,970
- Are you okay with this?
- I'm totally okay.

221
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,440
(She's an acupressure master.)

222
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,470
- She's good.
- Yes, go!

223
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,510
- What is this?
- Nice!

224
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,810
(Han Na is catching up.)

225
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,880
- What is happening?
- My gosh.

226
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,850
(What?)

227
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,020
I'm good with acupressure.

228
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,190
- Han Na can do that.
- She'll take that.

229
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,490
- I'm good with that.
- With acupressure?

230
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,120
She's lighter too.

231
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,830
- What is that?
- SHUHUA!

232
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,660
(Will she come from behind?)

233
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,870
- My gosh.
- Great.

234
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,500
You can do this.

235
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,900
- What are you doing, Han Na?
- SHUHUA.

236
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,000
(Meanwhile, SHUHUA escapes
the acupressure pad.)

237
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,210
- Let's go, Han Na.
- My gosh. Wait.

238
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,870
- You said you were good at this.
- Han Na.

239
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,010
- You said you were good at this!
- Han Na.

240
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,180
- Step on big ones.
- I can't do it.

241
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,350
- You can't?
- I can't do it.

242
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,580
- You got this.
- That's it.

243
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,820
You can do this.

244
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,120
- One more.
- You can do this.

245
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,080
- You can do this. There you go.
- Yes!

246
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,720
- A little more.
- Han Na, hurry up.

247
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,250
- Right here. Okay.
- You're so close.

248
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,020
- Okay.
- DinDin.

249
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,890
You're almost there.

250
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,230
(His small body is
for games like this.)

251
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,160
- Great, Han Na.
- What did you say?

252
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,830
- Great.
- You got this.

253
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,200
Okay.

254
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,400
(The 5th runners are on standby.)

255
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,340
(Starting with the 5th runners,
they must complete a lap.)

256
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,340
- Okay.
- Okay.

257
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,640
- You must go right away.
- Okay.

258
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,240
I'm AI!

259
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,610
- Okay.
- I'm AI!

260
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,910
I'm AI!

261
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,750
(He heads to the acupressure pad
as he tells himself that he's AI.)

262
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,220
(Grunting)

263
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,720
(His hypnosis breaks right away.)

264
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,220
- I got this.
- You're AI!

265
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,620
No, AI!

266
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,730
- Go!
- You're AI!

267
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,130
- No, AI!
- You're AI!

268
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,360
No, AI!

269
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,370
(Energizer Cho of 2 Days and 1 Night)

270
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,570
(Will he be able to match up to AI?)

271
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,500
- Hey!
- What was that?

272
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,010
- My gosh.
- Seriously?

273
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,480
(The baby potato strikes back.)

274
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,250
(Team Han Na
turns the table around.)

275
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,450
(He flies like a butterfly
and rolls like a potato.)

276
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,690
- You got this.
- My gosh.

277
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,050
(In the midst of the cheer
and surprise...)

278
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,360
- You got this.
- My gosh.

279
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,260
(Sae Ho quickly creates a gap
between them.)

280
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,590
- My gosh.
- Woo Il, hurry up!

281
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,630
What is that?

282
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,830
(They thought they didn't have
a chance to win,)

283
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,530
(but they're close to winning now.)

284
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,300
- Hey, this is getting fun.
- Oh, my.

285
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,400
- We got this.
- Let's go!

286
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,570
(The last runners: Dex and Joon)

287
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,940
- Sae Ho.
- This is crazy.

288
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,310
- Joon.
- This is amazing.

289
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,510
- We got this.
- Run!

290
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,710
(Joon starts off quickly
after getting tagged from Sae Ho.)

291
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,310
- We got this.
- Go.

292
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,350
Go!

293
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,850
(At this rate,
Team Han Na will win.)

294
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,380
- Hey, this isn't right.
- Run.

295
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,550
(Joon is going wild.)

296
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,020
- Go.
- Dex.

297
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,390
- Dex.
- Dex.

298
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,220
(Dex is their only hope.)

299
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,430
(Team Han Na is in the lead now.)

300
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,200
(Will Dex be able
to turn the table around?)

301
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,400
- Dex.
- Woo Il.

302
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,200
Dex.

303
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,440
- Hey, this isn't right.
- Run.

304
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,970
(He passes the acupressure pad
with three jumps.)

305
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,540
(He's fast!)

306
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,810
Go!

307
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,310
- Go!
- My gosh.

308
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,380
- Gosh, Joon.
- Dex!

309
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,380
Dex.

310
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,990
(Everyone's eyes are on them.)

311
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,320
(At that moment,)

312
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,460
(Joon loses his balance.)

313
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,020
- Dex.
- Joon.

314
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,490
- Dex!
- Dex!

315
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,000
(Dex takes this opportunity
and overtakes him.)

316
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,030
- Dex. My gosh.
- Dex.

317
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,640
(Team SHUHUA takes back the lead.)

318
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,510
(Screaming)

319
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,740
- Dex!
- My gosh.

320
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,240
(Dex quickly puts some distance
between them.)

321
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,580
- Dex!
- Dex!

322
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,610
Dex!

323
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,550
- Yes!
- My gosh.

324
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,350
- Yes!
- Dex!

325
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,690
- My gosh.
- Wait.

326
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:21,230
(The game is over.)

327
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,230
Dex!

328
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,000
(Dex was able to take back
the lead they blew.)

329
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,670
- Yes!
- Dex.

330
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,700
Gosh, you were amazing.

331
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,170
We were so close.

332
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,640
(The losing team
still can't believe it.)

333
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,680
What a bummer.

334
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,340
- My gosh.
- Gosh.

335
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,850
(Feeling disappointed)

336
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,280
Dex.

337
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,750
- My gosh.
- We had Dex.

338
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,120
- You get why he's so popular. Yes?
- Gosh, this is crazy.

339
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,550
- This is crazy.
- You're amazing.

340
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,550
- My gosh.
- No way.

341
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
He's my friend.

342
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,990
- He's my friend.
- Salute!

343
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,860
I chose him!

344
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,860
- SHUHUA, you did well too.
- Nice, SHUHUA.

345
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,230
- You did well.
- Nice.

346
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,270
You were so cool.

347
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,530
- He practically flew.
- He did.

348
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,070
- Dex was so cool.
- That was amazing.

349
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,400
- He took back the lead.
- My gosh.

350
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,170
- That was amazing.
- Did you see Dex?

351
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,910
(He's still bragging about Dex.)

352
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,110
- Gosh, Dex is amazing.
- Dex won it for us.

353
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,680
Joon looked slow compared to him.

354
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,440
- But he was really fast too.
- My gosh.

355
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,650
- Toward the end...
- That was amazing.

356
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,110
I would have lost
if he didn't make a mistake.

357
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,350
- Right.
- It was that moment.

358
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,820
- He slipped.
- It was during the forward roll.

359
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,420
- It was that moment.
- My gosh, what a pity.

360
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,350
I beat a man like that in Round Two.

361
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,360
- I see.
- All right.

362
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,890
Could you guys line up?

363
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,660
Here are the final results
of Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

364
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,660
My gosh, this is amazing.

365
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,500
Team Han Na has 100 points.

366
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,830
(Team Han Na won Round 1
and has 100 points.)

367
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,770
And Team SHUHUA has 200 points.

368
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,300
- Team SHUHUA won.
- Let's go!

369
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,770
(Team SHUHUA will sleep indoors.)

370
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,040
Congratulations on sleeping indoors.

371
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,540
(They will be sleeping outdoors.)

372
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,210
SHUHUA.

373
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,280
(We also prepared this
since we decided to go big.)

374
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,650
Hey, let's touch this.

375
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,450
(Dex is elated.)

376
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,520
- No.
- The dust.

377
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
All right.

378
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,160
Could you tell us how it was
to spend a day...

379
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,330
with your friends today?

380
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,160
I had so much fun.

381
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,200
It was a blast
spending time with my friend.

382
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
(Smiling)

383
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,740
I hope the two of you become closer.

384
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
- Yes.
- Right.

385
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,570
- We're very close.
- My gosh.

386
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,970
You still speak to each other
with honorifics.

387
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,580
- Drop them starting today.
- Yes.

388
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,380
- Let's drop the honorifics.
- My gosh.

389
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,580
- Joon and Han Na...
- Let's do it.

390
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,650
- Let's drop them.
- Drop them.

391
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,420
(A handshake
to celebrate their decision)

392
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,650
- Drop the honorifics.
- Drop the honorifics.

393
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,750
Drop the honorifics.

394
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,650
We rarely get to play as a team.

395
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,260
Since we played as a team,
I now have a sense of comradeship.

396
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,160
It's been a while
since I had fun with him,

397
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,190
- playing games like this.
- I see.

398
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,370
I thought I could only be a team
with my group.

399
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,640
But it feels like
I can also be a team with him.

400
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,540
(It was a more meaningful time
to work as a team with her friend.)

401
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,570
Today, I was here as Woo Il Nine.

402
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,240
There are Woo Il 10, Woo Il 11,
and so on.

403
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,240
- Okay.
- I see.

404
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,780
Please invite me to the show
once in a while.

405
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,480
I'll send them to the show.

406
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,750
- Yes.
- My gosh.

407
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,380
He's so cool. I feel so reassured.

408
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,550
(My friend is so cool and reliable.)

409
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,490
Lastly, the man
who turned the table around.

410
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,590
- He was so good.
- He's funny...

411
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,730
and strong.

412
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,500
- My gosh, Dex.
- Thank you.

413
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,130
- Today...
- He also got hit in the vital spot.

414
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,130
- Seriously.
- It was tough.

415
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,570
This was a show
I grew up watching...

416
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,600
with much respect,
so it was an honor to be here.

417
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,600
It feels like
I made my friend proud.

418
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,810
- I was so proud.
- It feels rewarding.

419
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,240
- He made you so proud.
- Yes.

420
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,980
Please give me a call
when Jong Min needs a break.

421
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,680
Why me?

422
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,010
- Why Jong Min?
- They can go on a break too.

423
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,450
It's around April 20.

424
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,550
We'll give you a call in April.

425
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,590
Well, is it official that...

426
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,990
I have to sleep over?

427
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,050
- Gosh.
- No.

428
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,520
- It's up to you.
- I see.

429
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,990
It's up to you.

430
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,030
- HANHAE.
- Yes.

431
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,030
If you want to be on our show
a little longer,

432
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,130
- you can sleep over.
- Okay.

433
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,300
If you're a bit tired today,
you can go.

434
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,270
If you put it like that,
I can't leave.

435
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,340
All right. I know we called you
out of the blue.

436
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,040
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

437
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,440
Let's say goodbye to our friends
who must get going.

438
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
And we'll get some sleep too.

439
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,310
- Yes.
- Sounds good.

440
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,350
- Yes.
- Well done, everyone.

441
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,150
You can just come outside
when you hear...

442
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,990
the wake-up song tomorrow morning.

443
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,990
- Okay.
- I got it.

444
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,020
- Okay.
- Okay.

445
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,260
So it's not just sleeping over.

446
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,020
- I would have to do...
- But...

447
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,090
the morning mission too.

448
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,360
We gave you a place to sleep,
so you must work.

449
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,030
What do you mean?

450
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,500
- It's what you heard.
- HANHAE. Sleep tight.

451
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
- I see.
- Just wait.

452
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,670
You guys did a great job today.
Thank you.

453
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,940
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

454
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,940
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

455
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,710
- Thank you.
- Who needs to go?

456
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,410
- Thank you, Han Na.
- My gosh.

457
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,980
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

458
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,710
- And...
- Right here.

459
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,710
- Just say the second part.
- Which camera is mine?
SHUHUA.

460
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,850
- "Who are we?"
- Which camera is mine?

461
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,880
Just say, "2 Days."

462
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,920
- 2 Days.
- 2 Days.

463
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,450
All right. Let's do it.

464
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,050
Ready, action.

465
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,990
Korea's best...

466
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,920
Real wild road variety show!

467
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,030
Our loyalty brought us together...

468
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,890
At KBS!

469
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,860
Who are we?

470
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,370
2 Days...

471
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,330
- And 1 Night!
- And 1 Night!

472
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,440
(2 Days and 1 Night)

473
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,240
Let's go!

474
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,970
(They had more fun
thanks to their friends.)

475
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,510
Okay!

476
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,410
(The game for sleeping arrangements
is over.)

477
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,850
- Everyone.
- Where's your car?

478
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,750
Dear viewers,
I hope to see you again.

479
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,220
Gosh, Han Na. Get home safely.

480
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,920
See you later.

481
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,120
- Take care.
- Bye.

482
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,220
- Good luck with the shoot.
- Thank you.

483
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
- Hurry up and leave.
- Bye.

484
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,520
- Yes.
- Bye. Good job, today.

485
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,730
I'm sorry.

486
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,730
- My gosh.
- I'm sorry.

487
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,990
- Thank you.
- Join the show when I'm away.

488
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,500
"Join the show when I'm away."

489
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,730
Who knows? Okay.

490
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,830
- I'll call you.
- I'll get going.

491
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,500
- Well done.
- 2 Days...

492
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,040
- And 1 Night!
- And 1 Night!

493
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,340
- Dex, bye.
- Gosh, he's great.

494
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,440
He's so energetic.

495
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,710
If no one else is leaving,
let's go inside.

496
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,010
Shall we go and wash up?

497
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,840
Yes. When you hear the wake-up song
tomorrow morning,

498
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,980
come outside.

499
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,980
- Okay.
- Okay.

500
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,010
- Good work.
- Thanks.

501
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,780
- Good work.
- Good work.

502
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,780
- Sleep tight.
- Goodnight.

503
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,050
(Joon is ready to go to sleep.)

504
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,790
Gosh, what is this?

505
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,290
What's this?
"Celebrities are sleeping inside."

506
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,120
(A present to keep them safe
from sleeping outside)

507
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,160
What is this?

508
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,430
Hey,
a celebrity is sleeping in here.

509
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,830
Hey, Mr. Celebrity.

510
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,430
(Chuckling)

511
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,570
Gosh, it was fun today. Good work.

512
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,670
Good work.

513
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,900
We were so close.

514
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,040
It's okay. You did well.

515
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,010
My gosh. This is...

516
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,110
(I'm sleeping outside again.)

517
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,320
(The one who can smile in times
of struggle is in the top tier.)

518
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,720
- Nice.
- We look so happy.

519
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,620
I look happy.

520
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,060
(It's a relief that he thinks so.)

521
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,260
(Meanwhile,
what about Team Indoors?)

522
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,230
This is like sleeping outside.

523
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,100
So we're going to sleep
just like this.

524
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,430
If you can sleep indoors,
where do you usually sleep?

525
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,430
In a room.

526
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,600
- A room?
- Yes.

527
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,400
A room. For example,

528
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,470
we'd be in the village hall.

529
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,870
- The village hall.
- Yes.

530
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,540
That's where you'd sleep.

531
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,880
I have a question.

532
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,710
Is it possible
to turn off the lights?

533
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,250
- You can't turn them off?
- What?

534
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,120
- What?
- We'll sleep like this?

535
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,450
- Sleeping outside is better then.
- Come on.

536
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,220
Sleeping outside is much better.

537
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,460
This isn't fair.

538
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,360
Sir, the lights don't go out
at this building?

539
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,360
- Gosh, it's bright.
- Sir.

540
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,660
Sir, the lights don't go out
at this building?

541
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,030
If this is the case,
we can just keep filming.

542
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Gosh, the lights...

543
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,400
They won't turn off the lights.

544
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,070
- It feels like the broad daylight.
- Yes.

545
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,970
What's going on?

546
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,270
My gosh.

547
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,640
(HANHAE enters the tent too.)

548
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,740
You're here.

549
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,110
- It's cold.
- HANHAE.

550
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,450
Can you go outside
and turn off the lights?

551
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,450
What?

552
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
(Beeping)

553
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,350
The car...

554
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,290
- Gosh, we're in a city.
- What?

555
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
We're definitely in a city.

556
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,720
- It's bright.
- It really is.

557
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,390
I've never slept
in a sleeping bag in my life.

558
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,790
Really?

559
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,330
It might be better than you think.

560
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,330
It's warm.

561
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,400
My gosh, what's this?

562
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,960
I told you it wasn't so bad.

563
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,600
(Vroom)

564
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Gosh, everything is great.
But it's quite noisy
with motorcycles and cars.

565
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,170
(Vroom)

566
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,940
Gosh, I didn't realize it
when I was walking around.

567
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,810
But now that I'm lying down here,
it's quite noisy.

568
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,810
It is noisy.

569
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,280
I'm getting sleepy since I'm tired.

570
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,750
Sleep tight. Good job today.

571
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,050
- Sleep tight.
- Goodnight, my friends.

572
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,220
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

573
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,620
Goodnight, my friends.

574
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,930
- Great.
- My gosh.

575
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,590
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

576
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,800
(A bright night in the city passes.)

577
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,070
(A brighter morning has come.)

578
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,540
(Just like any other day,)

579
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,840
(the members are sleeping soundly.)

580
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,580
(What kind of morning awaits them?)

581
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,650
(The wake-up song plays.)

582
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,250
(Se Yoon wakes up right away.)

583
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,650
(Sae Ho also wakes up right away.)

584
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,590
(Team Outdoors wakes up quickly.)

585
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,190
(Surprisingly, Team Indoors
wakes up right away too.)

586
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,160
(Watch out for the pause.)

587
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,070
(Including HANHAE who slept outdoors
for the first time on the show...)

588
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,540
(and Woo Il who slept indoors
for the first time on the show,)

589
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,770
(everyone is up.)

590
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,440
Hello.

591
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,040
- Good morning.
- My gosh.

592
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,180
Are you all awake?

593
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,350
- We're up.
- Yes.

594
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,050
- Please give us a moment.
- Okay.

595
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,920
(What are we going to do next?)

596
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,820
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

597
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,890
Was sleeping there okay?

598
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,890
- Really?
- My gosh.

599
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,190
(2 Days and 1 Night's bus
pulls in at that moment.)

600
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,990
- What's going on?
- That's not for us, right?

601
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,190
What? Do we have to get on the bus?

602
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,200
- That's for us. Why?
- This isn't right.

603
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,700
That's our bus.

604
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,930
Great, let's go!

605
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,770
- You can get on the bus.
- Really?

606
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,770
- Really?
- Are we going far from Seoul?

607
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,540
- The song was "City Escape."
- What's this?

608
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,940
- Are songs relevant?
- Yes.

609
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,810
We were supposed
to get off work at noon.

610
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,980
But what if we get off work
in Busan?

611
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,680
If we keep driving for five hours
from now on, we'll be there.

612
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,050
Right. Come on.

613
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,290
- We're escaping the city indeed.
- This is crazy. Something is up.

614
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,250
- This is driving me crazy.
- Today...

615
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,890
- As for this bus,
- Yes.

616
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,320
like we discussed at the last shoot,

617
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,890
the bus will only operate
until noon.

618
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,060
The destination of this bus is...

619
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,660
- What's the destination?
- What's the destination?

620
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,060
- My gosh, please.
- It's the East Sea.

621
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,070
- What?
- My gosh.

622
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,800
(It's the East Sea.)

623
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,970
- My gosh.
- Wait. Seriously?

624
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,370
(I can't believe this.)

625
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,780
(The bus will keep traveling
to the East Sea until noon.)

626
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,880
We should have said
we had to be home by noon.

627
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,510
We missed that.

628
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,020
- We should've made sure of it.
- I'm hungry.

629
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,680
My house is 15 minutes away
from here.

630
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,190
But why are we going
to the East Sea?

631
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,290
Why are you doing this? Sir.

632
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,720
Why don't you talk to him?

633
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,120
What are you doing on the bus?

634
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,260
- But...
- Hey, HANHAE.

635
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,130
HANHAE.
You should go to the East Sea.

636
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,260
- Well...
- I had no idea...

637
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,660
they would be this unreasonable.

638
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Seriously.

639
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,170
But not all of us will go.

640
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,570
All right.
While the bus is traveling,

641
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,470
only those
who complete the mission...

642
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,470
They can get off the bus.

643
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,210
can get off the bus immediately
and go home.

644
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,840
- Great.
- This is crazy.

645
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,250
- We can do it then.
- Then we can go home right now?

646
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,610
- My gosh.
- If you succeed.

647
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,820
This mission will decide
which one of you will get off.

648
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,920
It's called the Blind Guess Who.

649
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,020
- Blind Guess Who?
- Blind Guess Who?

650
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,220
We covered up the photo of someone
with stickers...

651
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,990
- in different sizes.
- Okay.

652
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,760
A part of the face will be revealed
gradually as we remove the paper.

653
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,500
- Okay.
- So you must look at the photo...

654
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,770
and correctly guess the person.

655
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,870
- Okay.
- I got it.

656
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
(Correct answer: Sung Dong Il
from "The Slave Hunters")

657
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,970
While we make a lap
around the KBS building,

658
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,370
we'll allow only one of you
to get off work.

659
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,180
I hope that's me.

660
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,880
- All right. Let's begin.
- You can call out your name.

661
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,350
- But...
- We'll go in order.

662
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,380
- Gosh, really?
- Yes.

663
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,380
- What's that?
- My gosh.
- It must be the head.
- That's too big.

664
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,380
Let's get it right on my first try.

665
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,790
We have to say our name, right?

666
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,790
- Yes.
- Number four...

667
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,860
(Only the hair is revealed.)

668
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,360
(He's never met this person.)

669
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,230
- It's a woman.
- I got it.

670
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,370
- Seo Hyun Jin.
- DinDin.

671
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,170
- Wrong.
- Sae Ho.

672
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,700
Park Hae Mi.

673
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,240
- Wrong.
- My gosh.

674
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,470
Who's next? Keep going.

675
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,540
That's it for the first reveal.

676
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,910
- They can't go again?
- Their chances are gone.

677
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,510
Seon Ho. Kim Ji Won.

678
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,710
Wrong.

679
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,780
Woo Il. Song Hye Kyo.

680
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,850
Woo Il. Song Hye Kyo.

681
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,480
What?

682
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,520
- What?
- What?

683
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,320
(What?)

684
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,820
(Is that the correct answer?)

685
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,850
What?

686
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,520
Come on, Woo Il.
That wasn't fun at all.

687
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,690
- Really?
- Come on.

688
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,690
Come on, Woo Il.

689
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,060
- Let's start over.
- Let's start over.

690
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,260
- It was a practice round.
- We can start over.

691
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,130
- Let's call it a practice round.
- All right.

692
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,130
- Woo Il.
- Come on. Seriously?

693
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,330
- That's correct.
- Okay.

694
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,870
- That's crazy.
- By the way,

695
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,600
you were spot on
which was unbelievable.

696
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,440
- All right.
- How is this possible?

697
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,010
(With all the stickers removed...)

698
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,210
(Correct answer: Song Hye Kyo
from "Descendants of the Sun")

699
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,610
Gosh,
it was impossible for me to guess.

700
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,650
Right.

701
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,650
I see. So that's how it goes?
That's fun. What a nice game.

702
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,490
- This was a practice round.
- Hey, this is...

703
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,650
- They prepared a nice one.
- Right.

704
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,490
- All right.
- I see. That's it.

705
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,490
- This is it.
- So...

706
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,130
Woo Il. They worked so hard
to come up with this game.

707
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,660
- I couldn't have figured it out.
- This can't be.

708
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,890
You can get off work now.

709
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,000
- Now?
- Yes.

710
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,300
- Just like this?
- Yes.

711
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,430
- Okay.
- We're on the same team.

712
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,570
It will be more entertaining
if you stay here longer.

713
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,900
- Right. That's true.
- You must join us...

714
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,300
- to make it entertaining.
- That's true,

715
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,940
but I'm sure I'll have a chance
to do that another time.

716
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,040
(Meanwhile, the bus returns
to the KBS building.)

717
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,310
Woo Il is really leaving...

718
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,510
- after sleeping with us.
- Woo Il.

719
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,010
- You should've slept at home then.
- Right.

720
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,050
You didn't have to...

721
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,350
(Why did he make
things difficult for himself?)

722
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,120
If you agree that this was
a practice run, you can stay.

723
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,590
- No. That's...
- Listen.

724
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,020
- What do you say?
- This looks great right now.

725
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,360
- Going to the sea would be perfect.
- Right.

726
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,560
- That's true.
- Come on, stay.

727
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,990
No, seriously.
What do you want me to do?

728
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,160
(Just let me go.)

729
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,760
- Well, you...
- He should go.

730
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,330
- Bye.
- Okay.

731
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,560
- Bye, Jong Min.
- Okay.

732
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,800
- I'll call you.
- Good work.

733
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,800
- Seriously?
- Good work.

734
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,100
- We can do another one, right?
- Good work.

735
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,210
Is my parking fee settled?

736
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,740
(I slept over here.)

737
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
Have a good day.

738
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,080
(Woo Il gets off the show
at 7:40 a.m.)

739
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,580
(Chuckling)

740
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,950
Let's edit the footage,
so it looks like...

741
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,580
- Woo Il went home last night.
- Hey.

742
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,720
- He left so early.
- Yes.

743
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,820
We can make it look like
he left last night.

744
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,850
- Let's go with that.
- No one would know.

745
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,020
- That's it.
- Let's do another one.

746
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,090
- Please.
- Okay.

747
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,920
- I really need to get home.
- Same here.

748
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,130
I didn't hang the laundry.

749
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,660
- That was random.
- Yes.

750
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,430
- Your clothes will smell then.
- That's not good.

751
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,760
They will stink.

752
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,830
Everyone,
since HANHAE really wanted it,

753
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,940
- I'll allow 1 more person...
- Yes, 1 more.

754
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,910
- get off here in Yeouido.
- Yes.

755
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,040
- But...
- I see. So we're getting farther.

756
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,880
- Please.
- Please.

757
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,280
- Seriously.
- Let's begin.

758
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,810
- Number one.
- It's impossible to guess it...

759
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,910
after the first one.

760
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,980
It has to be the nose.
I can tell it will be the nose.

761
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,080
- It's the lips.
- It's the lips.

762
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,450
(Can they guess the person
only by looking at the lips?)

763
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,890
- Gosh, how can we get it right?
- Se Yoon.

764
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,890
(Se Yoon!)

765
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,320
- Se Yoon.
- Kim Hye Soo?

766
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,760
- Joon.
- Darn.

767
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,290
- It has to be wrong.
- Who is it?

768
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,530
What?

769
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,200
- Really? Are you serious?
- Come on.

770
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,370
- They look like her lips.
- Kim Hye Soo.

771
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,130
- I think they look like her lips.
- Tell me.

772
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,440
Tell me now.

773
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,770
He must have seen the name
on the board.

774
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,800
- That's cheating.
- He must've seen it.

775
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,040
- I didn't.
- He must've seen the name.

776
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,210
- No way.
- I'm 100 percent sure he did.

777
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,040
- I'm sensitive. I'll go berserk.
- I bet he saw the name.

778
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,880
- You can't cheat like that.
- They are Kim Hye Soo's lips.

779
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,250
That must be Kim Hye Soo. Seriously.

780
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,250
- No.
- Well...

781
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,080
(What's the correct answer?)

782
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,450
Yes, it is Kim Hye Soo.

783
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,720
(Correct answer: Kim Hye Soo
from "The Queen of Office")

784
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,420
- HANHAE.
- Darn it.

785
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,490
I'm leaving.

786
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,390
- I'm sorry.
- Se Yoon.

787
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,630
- Kim Hye Soo.
- Really?

788
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,330
- Se Yoon, don't do that.
- HANHAE.

789
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,300
I quietly asked him earlier.

790
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,030
"HANHAE,
things could get out of hand."

791
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,570
"If you need to go, leave now."

792
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,570
He said, "Se Yoon, but still.
I must stay with you all the way."

793
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,710
You fool. I'm sure
they recorded what you said.

794
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,770
I'm leaving.

795
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,510
- Stop the bus now. Come on.
- Okay.

796
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,980
- We should let you go now.
- HANHAE.

797
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,550
- I'm sorry.
- Isn't this a record?

798
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,080
- He's getting off work so early.
- My gosh.

799
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,720
- HANHAE, I'm leaving.
- Are you really leaving?

800
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,580
Yes. Can you sit back down?
So I can take a picture before I go.

801
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,580
Hurry.

802
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,020
- Gosh, how could this happen?
- My goodness.

803
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,020
Your face is puffy.
So you're perfect here. One, two.

804
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,420
DinDin, could you smile a bit?

805
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,460
DinDin. Come on, smile.

806
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,530
People don't know this is
the getting-off-work mission.

807
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,430
I'll watch the show. You punks.
Have fun going to the East Sea.

808
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,300
To the East Sea.

809
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,330
My gosh.

810
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,070
- I'm leaving.
- I'm so envious.

811
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,000
(Escaping from the bus)

812
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
- This is...
- It's not even 8 a.m.

813
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,240
He got off work at 7:50 a.m.

814
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,940
(Bolting right away)

815
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,010
Gosh, Se Yoon left
when his friend is still here.

816
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,220
- Gosh, I really want to go home.
- I want to go home too.

817
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,390
You know what?
He left way too early.

818
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,390
I'm sorry to interrupt. I see
a mountain beast. Let's hurry.

819
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,390
(A mountain beast?)

820
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,130
I see a mountain beast. Let's hurry.

821
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
What?

822
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,700
(A mountain beast?)

823
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,200
HANHAE!

824
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,730
DinDin!

825
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,100
(Have a safe trip...)

826
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,740
(to the East Sea.)

827
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,670
(The mountain beast returns
to sneer at them.)

828
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,670
(Groaning)

829
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,440
(Moon Se Yoon gets off work
at 7:50 a.m.)

830
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,650
I'll get going.

831
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,420
Clear your head for a minute,
and then we'll go.

832
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,650
Are we really going?

833
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,780
How much?

834
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,850
How much should we clear our heads?

835
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,050
He told us to empty our minds.

836
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,460
- I can't believe it.
- Is he being serious?

837
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,590
(It may be hard to believe,
but we're leaving Yeouido.)

838
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,290
Are we driving for 20 to 30 minutes?

839
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,800
- About that long.
- Thirty minutes?

840
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,930
- Really?
- For how long?

841
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,800
- Get some sleep.
- I'm going to sleep.

842
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Okay.

843
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,800
(He's off to sleep right away.)

844
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,240
(Can he even fall asleep now?)

845
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
Joon.

846
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,570
If you and I get off
at the East Sea,

847
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,440
- let's have a meal.
- Of course.

848
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,040
While looking at the sea.

849
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,150
Such a positive attitude
is necessary...

850
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,350
to be on 2 Days and 1 Night.

851
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,720
When I saw Jong Min sleep,

852
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,550
I thought that he was a topnotcher.

853
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,490
(He's a topnotcher for sleeping deep
when times are hard.)

854
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,420
Did anyone get a text from Woo Il?

855
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,430
(Full of high spirits)

856
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,970
"Eight great restaurants
you must try..."

857
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,100
"while traveling the East Sea."

858
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,770
That's interesting.

859
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,100
(From KBS to the East Sea)

860
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,540
(The East Sea tourist bus
keeps advancing.)

861
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,940
We're getting farther away
from Seoul.

862
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,010
(The East Sea tourist bus
keeps advancing.)

863
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,310
I see the city of Guri.

864
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,110
(Moving away from Seoul,
they're approaching Gyeonggi.)

865
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,250
Everyone.

866
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,310
- Yes?
- Yes.

867
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,050
Everyone.

868
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,850
(Getting up on time)

869
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,950
Hey, let's go.

870
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,890
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

871
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,190
- Let's go.
- Let's just go.

872
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,990
The next stop is...

873
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,090
located right before
the entrance of Yangyang Expressway.

874
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,090
That's the best.

875
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,860
It's the parking lot
of Namyangju Hangang Park.

876
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,330
This is a good one.

877
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,630
- Once we get...
- This is a really good one.

878
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,200
- on the expressway...
- It's over once you get on it.

879
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,470
This might be better
than getting off in Yeouido.

880
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,940
- You'd survive dramatically.
- Once you get on the expressway,

881
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,110
it's practically over.

882
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm getting a dopamine rush.
This is good.

883
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,310
- I'm ready.
- Here we go.

884
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,050
Number one.

885
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,350
(It's the lips again.)

886
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,380
The person looks familiar.

887
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,480
(It's the lips again.)

888
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,820
It's difficult.

889
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,850
(It's difficult.)

890
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,090
Each of you, take a guess.

891
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,460
I got it.

892
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,430
Lee Joon?

893
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,430
- Me? Don't be ridiculous.
- Incorrect.

894
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,800
I have two people in mind.

895
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,930
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho?

896
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,800
- Jung Eun Chae.
- Incorrect.

897
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,070
I have no idea.

898
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,600
My goodness.

899
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,470
- I'm not a visual learner.
- Do you want to see number two?

900
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,770
- Okay.
- Here's number two.

901
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,810
Okay.

902
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,280
- I know.
- I know.
What?

903
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,580
(Scarlet lips...)

904
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,620
(and an intense look?)

905
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,750
- HANHAE.
- Seon Ho.

906
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,190
I was first.

907
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,190
It's HANHAE.

908
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,820
HANHAE, you should say Moon Se Yoon
to be funny.

909
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,720
I don't care about being funny.
Is it Cha Eun Woo?

910
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,360
- Right, it's Eun Woo.
- I don't think so.

911
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,560
It's not Cha Eun Woo.

912
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,100
- Is it Cha Eun Woo?
- Am I right?

913
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,230
It's Eun Woo.

914
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,500
- Please.
- Who...

915
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,670
- Is it Cha Eun Woo?
- Correct.

916
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,030
He got it.

917
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,600
(Splashing water out of joy)

918
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,800
It was Cha Eun Woo.

919
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,670
- It was Cha Eun Woo.
- Yes!

920
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,110
(Even with the splash of water,
I'm happy.)

921
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,480
I also knew the answer.

922
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,880
Why did you come here...

923
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,480
and take away our chance?

924
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,850
He's our competitor.

925
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,750
- Why was he even invited?
- Why are you here?

926
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,020
(The person with
these strong facial features)

927
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,290
(Cha Eun Woo of ASTRO)

928
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,660
He's very handsome.

929
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,290
- What a bummer.
- He's very good-looking.

930
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,790
(HANHAE will get off work.)

931
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,500
My house was only ten minutes away,

932
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,630
- but now it'll take an hour.
- Let's do one more question.

933
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,570
- Let's do one more question.
- One more question.

934
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,300
- One more round.
- It's sad to end now.

935
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,570
- One more round.
- One more round.

936
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,070
- One more round.
- One more round.

937
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,570
- One more round.
- One more round.

938
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,270
- Make it nice and clean.
- Make it nice and clean.

939
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,440
- One more round.
- One more round.

940
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,640
Here we go.

941
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,680
(The game to save
one more person starts.)

942
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,150
Oh, come on.

943
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,980
How can we recognize him?

944
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,780
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min?

945
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
TAEMIN?

946
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,790
- That sounds reasonable.
- Incorrect.

947
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,660
I know. It's V.

948
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,320
- V of BTS.
- Incorrect.

949
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,430
Taeyang?

950
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,290
- Incorrect.
- Gosh.

951
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,300
Goodness.

952
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,160
- It's hard to tell.
- I have no idea.

953
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,370
- Here's number two.
- Okay.

954
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,100
Jong Min, could you move back?

955
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,100
What for?

956
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,500
You might block Seon Ho's view.

957
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,770
Seon Ho isn't important right now.

958
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,140
(Getting off work is more important
than Seon Ho.)

959
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,140
All right.

960
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,640
What's that?

961
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,840
The face...

962
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,510
(We'll reveal the answer
only to the viewers.)

963
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,480
(The one with this sharp nose)

964
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,220
(WINTER of aespa)

965
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,950
- What?
- The face...

966
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,090
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min?

967
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,490
Lee Joon.

968
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,060
Why would that be me?

969
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,090
- Incorrect.
- Darn it.

970
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,860
He's also handsome.
How is he so handsome?

971
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,560
Jung Kook of BTS.

972
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,830
(Answer: WINTER of aespa)

973
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,830
Incorrect.

974
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,460
Is it j-hope of BTS?

975
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,700
- Incorrect.
- Incorrect.

976
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,800
Here's number three.

977
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,300
- Number three.
- I don't think it's BTS.

978
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,370
- Number three.
- This time, it'll be the eye.

979
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,310
- Number three.
- I want to be a visual learner.

980
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,310
I got it.

981
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,340
- I got it.
- I got it.

982
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
I got it.
(Seon Ho called out first.)

983
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
- It's a girl.
- I got it.

984
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,910
- WINTER.
- I got it.

985
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,650
It's WINTER.

986
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,020
(Stomping with joy)

987
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,090
Goodness.

988
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,190
Gosh, I got it too.

989
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,330
This was when they sang "Whiplash."

990
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,460
I was wondering
where I saw that outfit.

991
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,360
(It's the stage outfit
for "Whiplash.")

992
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,670
(I like aespa.)

993
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,970
I'm sorry.

994
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,700
(They escape
from the bus dramatically.)

995
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,700
Yes.

996
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,040
I didn't know that fine dust
could be this refreshing.

997
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,740
Fine dust? I don't care about that.

998
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,610
- Can we go?
- Yes.

999
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,880
We can go now.

1000
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,580
You're at Namyangju Hangang Park.

1001
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,580
You may go back home.

1002
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,480
Should I look
for my next apartment here?

1003
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,890
(The bus with
the remaining members sets off.)

1004
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,390
(Sullen)

1005
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,130
We have some gimbap.
Would you like some?

1006
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,060
- Gosh, okay.
- Thank you.

1007
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,200
(His face glows suddenly
at the sound of gimbap.)

1008
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,270
- Thank you.
- This is truly a picnic.

1009
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,170
(They don't know
when they'll get off this bus.)

1010
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,340
I usually have a hard time eating
in the morning,

1011
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,940
but this is good.

1012
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:47,340
(After driving for one hour)

1013
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,950
Before getting to the East Sea,

1014
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,020
our last stop is Gapyeong Rest Stop.

1015
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,520
- Is this the last stop?
- Gapyeong?

1016
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,750
- Gapyeong means...
- Gapyeong?

1017
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,190
We got to Gapyeong already?

1018
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,660
- Here we go.
- Okay.

1019
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,860
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

1020
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,930
Let's go home.

1021
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,160
(Giving the question right away)

1022
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,360
Number one.

1023
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,900
What? How could we recognize him?

1024
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
I got it.

1025
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,600
- DinDin.
- DinDin?

1026
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,040
Byeon Woo Seok.

1027
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,270
I don't think so.

1028
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,670
No way.

1029
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,340
It must be him.

1030
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,140
- Am I right?
- No.

1031
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,210
I think he's right.

1032
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,250
That's correct.

1033
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,250
Dopamine rush!

1034
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,250
He's right.

1035
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,750
(He lost his chance
to get off work again.)

1036
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,820
It's correct.

1037
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,160
(When the stickers are taken off)

1038
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,360
(Byeon Woo Seok
from "Lovely Runner")

1039
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,860
I'm terrible
at picking things up visually.

1040
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,290
(DinDin, get off work and run.)

1041
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,330
That's good.

1042
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,200
I'm disappointed with myself.

1043
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,730
It's okay, DinDinDinDinDin

1044
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,730
It's okay

1045
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,970
DinDinDinDinDin

1046
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,100
(Singing)

1047
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,340
I'm going home, DinDinDinDinDin

1048
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,510
(Being the most annoying)

1049
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,810
I'm going home

1050
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,210
(Sighing)

1051
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,310
It's okay, DinDinDinDinDin

1052
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,880
(The getting-off-work song continues
even outside the bus.)

1053
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,350
(The one who failed feels terrible.)

1054
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,420
What?

1055
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,490
I'm just going to watch.

1056
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,220
(He stays behind to watch them.)

1057
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,490
Everyone.

1058
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,990
- This is really...
- One more person?

1059
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,690
- your last chance.
- One person?

1060
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,430
- Okay.
- Please.

1061
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
This is your last chance.

1062
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,730
Let's recharge my dopamine.

1063
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,670
- Why is it so big?
- What?

1064
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,940
- You'll throw the die.
- This is based on luck.

1065
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,900
(A real game based on luck)

1066
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,270
(Checking the die)

1067
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,040
Shouldn't I be the one to throw it?

1068
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,610
It can't be the three of you.

1069
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,310
DinDin, you won't mind
even if they resent you?

1070
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,480
- Throw it, DinDin.
- Then bring it.

1071
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Here you go.

1072
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,180
(I'm okay with resentment...)

1073
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,980
(because I'm going home.)

1074
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,950
- I'll do it.
- Throw it, DinDin.

1075
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,320
Let's do it in one go.

1076
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,390
Get together.

1077
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,790
- So is DinDin throwing it?
- Okay.

1078
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,190
- The person whose face comes up?
- Yes.

1079
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,820
No one can resent him.

1080
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,460
- No one can resent me.
- No one can resent him.

1081
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,630
- Okay?
- That's not allowed.

1082
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,900
There will only be one round.

1083
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,230
- Okay, one round.
- Is there no practice round?

1084
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,460
No, there isn't any.

1085
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,630
- There isn't any.
- Go.

1086
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,730
Keep it nice and clean.

1087
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,800
- Here I go.
- Throw it up high.

1088
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
Here I go!

1089
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,740
(The die is cast.)

1090
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,980
(Who will be the last one
to get off work?)

1091
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,280
(The last to get off work:
Cho Sae Ho)

1092
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,120
(Getting-off-work dance out of joy)

1093
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,920
(Joon failed to get off work.)

1094
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,960
(Jong Min also failed.)

1095
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,630
(You can't resent me.)

1096
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,400
I knew you'd save me.

1097
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,100
(Sae Ho and DinDin get off work
at 10 a.m.)

1098
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,600
Let's get going now.

1099
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,270
- Let's go.
- Shall we go?

1100
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,140
(The overtime workers are
depressed.)

1101
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,910
(Let me go home.)

1102
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,680
- Here you go.
- I have some coffee.

1103
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,750
(At that moment,
they're given a bag.)

1104
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,850
What's this?

1105
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,620
Walnut cake? What's that?

1106
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,250
(Smiling)

1107
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,620
It has pine nuts inside.

1108
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,890
(The innocent young men feel better
right away.)

1109
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,230
(Exclaiming)

1110
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,030
- It's delicious.
- Look at the red bean paste.

1111
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,930
The red bean paste is amazing.

1112
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,400
The others didn't get to taste
the walnut cake.

1113
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,040
- Right.
- I feel bad for them.

1114
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,370
You're extremely positive.

1115
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,570
You're very positive.

1116
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,740
You didn't get to eat it, right?

1117
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,980
(Look, aren't you jealous?)

1118
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,880
DinDin sent me a text right away.

1119
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,720
"Work hard. DinDinDinDinDin."

1120
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,620
(His singing isn't over.)

1121
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,720
- It's okay
- What is he doing?

1122
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,960
(Getting on his nerves)

1123
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,760
We were so unlucky.
There were eight of us.

1124
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,260
I know.

1125
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,100
(However)

1126
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:33,470
(As it's the weekend,
the traffic is getting heavier.)

1127
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,370
(The bus has practically stopped.)

1128
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,440
(Everyone is exhausted from
the long trip and falls asleep.)

1129
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,210
The shoot will be over tomorrow
at 12 p.m.

1130
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,010
(They were supposed
to get off work at 12 p.m.)

1131
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,020
(They still have a long way to go,
and the clock is ticking.)

1132
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,490
- It's 1 p.m., but we aren't there yet.
- What?

1133
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,390
It's 1 p.m., but we aren't there yet.

1134
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,490
I should get off.

1135
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,930
- Right, but...
- What?

1136
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,690
We were supposed
to get off work at 12 p.m.

1137
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,760
(Let us get off work.)

1138
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,660
Let's go. I'm jumping off the bus.

1139
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,400
(His eyes are dimly out of focus.)

1140
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,270
They aren't keeping their promise.

1141
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,000
(Feeling sorry)

1142
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,470
We should be compensated for it.

1143
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,610
We need proof.
Otherwise, they'll edit it out.

1144
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,810
It's 1:59 p.m. right now.

1145
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,780
We haven't arrived
in the East Sea yet.

1146
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:21,250
(They announced it
in their group chat room.)

1147
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,690
We should definitely be...

1148
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,820
- compensated for this.
- Right.

1149
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,560
- 2 Days and 1 Night...
- What would the viewers think?

1150
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,890
Right. The motto of our show is
keeping promises.

1151
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,030
- Exactly.
- Yes.

1152
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,900
Do we go back inside
while sleeping outdoors?

1153
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,300
- Honestly...
- You're right.

1154
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,400
We don't pretend
to sleep outdoors...

1155
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,000
- and go back inside.
- We don't break our promise.

1156
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,040
We don't go back outside
during the shoot.

1157
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,200
We can't eat because we lost a game.

1158
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,570
Then we say,
"I'm sorry, but I'm going to eat."

1159
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,040
(Good job, Jong Min.)

1160
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Is that what we do?

1161
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,080
I talk so well.

1162
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,610
You're talking so well today.

1163
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,610
(Pleased)

1164
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,450
We slept for too long.

1165
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,250
Give us appropriate compensation.

1166
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,420
Something that we'd be content with.

1167
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,990
We'll discuss it among ourselves.

1168
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,290
Yes, talk with the others.

1169
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,530
- The weather is nice.
- It's the best weather.

1170
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,100
We arrived in Gangneung
after six hours.

1171
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,330
The 2 Days and 1 Night flag
is over there.

1172
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
Will the first person to pull it out
go home?

1173
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,540
- Hey.
- Here we go.

1174
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,770
(They arrived at Gyeongpo Beach
at 2:30 p.m.)

1175
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,810
At 2:30 p.m.

1176
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:21,840
- Compared to our promise...
- You're 2 hours and 30 minutes late.

1177
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,250
We got here a little late.

1178
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,980
- A little late?
- We're very late.

1179
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,050
Now...

1180
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,550
(Curious)

1181
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,150
You may get off work.

1182
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,520
- What?
- What are you saying?

1183
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,320
It's been less than five minutes
since we got off the bus.

1184
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,990
- We traveled 6 hours.
- We traveled 6 hours.

1185
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,030
- Well done.
- Wait a minute.

1186
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,830
We traveled 6 hours,
and after 5 minutes...

1187
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,500
The way back to Seoul
should be better.

1188
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,770
(2 Days and 1 Night)

1189
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

1190
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,410
- It looks beautiful.
- Are these cherry blossoms?

1191
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,070
- The flowers are blooming.
- Hi.

1192
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,840
They look like popcorn.

1193
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,180
What type of flowers are these?

1194
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,080
- What?
- What type of flowers are these?

1195
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,450
They're strawberry flavor.

1196
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,780
Aren't these apricot blossoms?

1197
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,690
Gosh, there are carp too.

1198
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,420
Aren't these cherry blossoms?

1199
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,820
(The spring in March)

1200
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,130
Hello.

1201
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,790
Hi.

1202
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,360
- Hello.
- Yes.

1203
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,970
This will definitely hurt our backs.

1204
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,270
Give us benefits.

1205
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,140
- We should settle before sitting.
- Now...

1206
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,440
The labor union is saying...

1207
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
that you didn't keep...

1208
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,870
- your promise with us.
- Hold on. That's...

1209
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,480
The chairman
of our labor union is...

1210
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
very furious.

1211
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,580
He's about to take off
his microphone.

1212
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,650
- You need to solve this problem.
- Great!

1213
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,220
(The getting-off-work mission
during the last shoot)

1214
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,350
(It's 1 p.m., but we aren't there yet.)

1215
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,520
(The promise to finish at 12 p.m.
was broken.)

1216
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,930
(Let's go. I'm jumping off the bus.)

1217
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,290
(We need to be compensated.)

1218
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,400
We mentioned the promise...

1219
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,360
Shouldn't promises be kept?

1220
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,330
- Right.
- If you break it...

1221
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,330
so easily...

1222
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,500
What's the use
of the pinkie promise?

1223
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
You know how it goes.

1224
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,800
When you bring up the issue,

1225
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,640
they always ask us
to wait until next week.

1226
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Then one year passes by.

1227
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,810
Will you announce your position
right away?

1228
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,410
- We'll announce it soon.
- Okay.

1229
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,880
- You guys are so reliable.
- Please sit down.

1230
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
(Our labor union is reliable.)

1231
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,620
- It's because...
- This matters to us.

1232
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,920
- Right.
- This is our business.

1233
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,320
- We're one team.
- Okay.

1234
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,890
- The labor union.
- Goodness.

1235
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,190
(The strike is paused,
and they sit among the flowers. )

1236
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,730
- For our health...
- Is it spring now?

1237
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,890
- Spring is here.
- Seriously.

1238
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,260
(The romance of sitting on a mat
under the flower trees)

1239
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,500
- It's very warm here.
- We can sleep here at night.

1240
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,970
- Seriously.
- Right?

1241
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,470
- Now, it's possible to sleep.
- It could hurt our lower back.

1242
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,200
It's finally here.

1243
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,910
Are we in Yangsan?

1244
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,140
(Glancing)

1245
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,210
Yes, it's Yangsan.

1246
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,580
Did you cut your hair
at a hair salon?

1247
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,140
Yes. What do you mean?

1248
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,250
- I mean...
- As soon as he saw me,

1249
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,680
he said, "Did you cut your hair
at a hair salon?"

1250
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
No.

1251
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,250
What are you implying?

1252
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,790
(In between a compliment
and an insult)

1253
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,320
How could you...

1254
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,560
- He got his hair permed.
- Did you get it permed?

1255
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,220
I got my hair permed.

1256
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,830
- It suits you well.
- Was it a penalty?

1257
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,230
- Was it a penalty?
- No, I paid for it.

1258
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,130
- I see.
- Were you stressed out too?

1259
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,830
(Goodness)

1260
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,230
Today's travel destination is...

1261
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,540
(Where water parsley that's full
of spring scent originates from)

1262
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,140
(The first place
where scattered apricot blossoms...)

1263
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,640
(bloom in spring)

1264
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,640
(A therapeutic travel destination
with gentle beauty)

1265
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,810
The home village of spring flowers
that becomes fragrant in the spring.

1266
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,120
This is Yangsan
in South Gyeongsang Province.

1267
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,450
- Yangsan?
- Yes.

1268
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,390
One of the first types of flowers...

1269
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,920
that blooms in the spring is
apricot blossoms.

1270
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,560
- Apricot blossoms?
- Apricot blossoms?

1271
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,960
- Apricot blossoms have bloomed.
- These are apricot blossoms.

1272
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,030
These are apricot blossoms.

1273
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,560
This is the theme we prepared...

1274
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,000
for the start
of the beautiful season spring.

1275
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,270
It's Spring in Yangsan.

1276
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,400
- "Spring in Yangsan."
- Yes.

1277
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,570
It sounds nice.

1278
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,540
You'll play in teams of two.

1279
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,040
- Two against two against two?
- Two against two against two?

1280
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,040
(2 against 2)

1281
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,980
(They won't let him off the hook.)

1282
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,450
- Mocking.
- Don't you want to mock?

1283
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,050
I'm sure that
someone wants to do it.

1284
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,520
- In my opinion...
- He's doing it.

1285
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,220
(A phrase alone makes them laugh.)

1286
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,320
Two against two.

1287
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,290
Until when will we play
in teams of two?

1288
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,530
Until the end of today.

1289
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,360
- Until the evening?
- Yes.

1290
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,030
- Until we go to bed?
- We'll be in the same boat.

1291
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,230
Until we go to bed?

1292
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,630
With the labor union members...

1293
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,070
You'll be in teams of two.

1294
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,640
If we have the right to refuse...

1295
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,340
- It won't be a benefit.
- Picking two...

1296
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,780
Give this to the one
you want to team up with.

1297
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,340
There's no reason to refuse.

1298
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,580
It's a tree branch.

1299
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,210
I like both ideas.

1300
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,520
It was on the ground.
I didn't break it.

1301
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,650
Cho Sae Ho!

1302
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,950
- It was on the ground.
- Cho Sae Ho.

1303
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,690
What? It was on the ground.

1304
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,720
Cho Sae Ho, put it back.

1305
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,560
- Did he break it?
- Save the tree branch!

1306
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,390
Save it now.

1307
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,190
(Doing his best)

1308
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,400
- I don't know if it'll stick.
- He broke the tree.

1309
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,530
Cho Sae Ho broke it.

1310
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,500
Sae Ho, did you put
your saliva on it?

1311
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,300
That part is slightly rotten.

1312
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,170
Sae Ho.

1313
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,410
The branch is leaning.

1314
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,940
It's moving a lot.

1315
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,980
You're so childish.
Did you say "rotten?" All right.

1316
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,050
- He took another one.
- It was already on the ground.

1317
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,150
Let's start with Joon.

1318
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,680
Let's keep our eyes closed.

1319
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,750
Okay.

1320
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,490
Give it to the person
while hugging him from behind.

1321
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,320
Or stick it on him.

1322
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,260
All right.

1323
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,860
I think Sae Ho and DinDin
are brainiacs.

1324
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,400
Sae Ho is athletic too.

1325
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,400
Seon Ho is lucky.

1326
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,670
- I made up my mind.
- He made a decision.

1327
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,910
(Who will be Joon's first pick?)

1328
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,640
- What?
- Are you giving it to me?

1329
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,840
(He picked Se Yoon.)

1330
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,850
- Really?
- Se Yoon.

1331
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,510
- You can refuse.
- Gosh.

1332
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,220
Can you tell us why you picked me?

1333
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,780
Why did you pick me
instead of these underlings?

1334
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,690
- He's strong.
- Right.

1335
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,020
- I don't know what we'll play.
- They make a powerful team.

1336
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,390
- We'll win with strength.
- They're strong.

1337
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,830
(A team with focus in strength)

1338
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,660
I haven't slept much last night.

1339
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,930
- He definitely wants to win.
- Right.

1340
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,530
I want to take it easy.

1341
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,800
That's right, we should.

1342
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,170
We have to spend
the entire day together.

1343
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,140
That's true.

1344
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,070
- To entertainers...
- I want to play comfortably.

1345
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,580
- Instead?
- Are you picking him?

1346
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,710
All right.

1347
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,980
- He made his decision.
- Okay.

1348
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,550
What do you think, Jong Min?

1349
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,180
(His priority is protecting
his sense of hearing.)

1350
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,120
If Jong Min agrees,

1351
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,490
the two of them will become
a team automatically.

1352
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,190
- I mean...
- Wait.

1353
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,720
You didn't care
whom you teamed up with.

1354
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,490
- Why not me?
- Why not me?

1355
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,860
- You don't want to team up with me?
- I mean...

1356
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:11,890
Why you...

1357
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,760
- That prickles.
- It's okay. Sit down.

1358
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,260
- I should sit down.
- Hey.

1359
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,800
- Sae Ho, why don't you like me?
- Why you...

1360
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,870
When did I not like you?

1361
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,400
- You said...
- As soon as you saw me,

1362
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,770
you asked if I got my haircut
at a hair salon.

1363
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,140
I'm also part of the society.

1364
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,610
You think I'd shave my head
like in "The Man from Nowhere?"

1365
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,380
(Laughing)

1366
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,150
What's wrong? My haircut looks good.

1367
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,050
(He must have dolled up.)

1368
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,050
- Really?
- Do you want to argue?
I'm sorry.

1369
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,990
Do you want to start with me?

1370
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,490
- Your haircut looks nice.
- I tried to look...

1371
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,120
- nice for today.
- Never mind.

1372
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,390
You two make a good match today.
You should be a couple.

1373
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,760
(Sae Ho and Seon Ho
become partners.)

1374
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,630
- I'll pick DinDin.
- You...

1375
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,330
(We hope you'll be happy together.)

1376
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,630
You will be traveling everywhere
in Yangsan today.

1377
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,870
Let me show you.

1378
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,570
- We prepared seed money for you.
- What?

1379
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,800
- Is it money?
- It's seed money.

1380
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,270
Good things will happen...

1381
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,440
- the more you collect seed money.
- Right.

1382
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,480
(Seed money that will be
important today)

1383
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,940
Now,

1384
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,310
we'll settle the matter
from the last shoot.

1385
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,150
It should be something big.

1386
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,550
- It's time that we become one.
- What you did was terrible.

1387
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,520
We thought hard about...

1388
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,890
how to compensate you.

1389
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,660
To Jong Min and Joon,

1390
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,330
we'll give 10,000 seeds
from the start.

1391
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:20,400
- What?
- No way.

1392
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,930
They'll give us 10,000 seeds
from the start.

1393
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,130
No way.

1394
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,600
- Did he say 10,000 seeds?
- It's 10 dollars.

1395
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,670
- No way. Here's why.
- From the start?

1396
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,940
- We lost 150 minutes.
- That's correct.

1397
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,140
How much is ten minutes worth?

1398
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:32,410
If you were to buy ten minutes.

1399
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,640
Let's say that 1 minute equals 100.

1400
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,310
You should get 15,000 seeds.

1401
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,580
Okay.

1402
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,920
Wait a minute.

1403
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,050
Let me think.

1404
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:43,920
- What about...
- Wait a minute.

1405
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,090
What about the two of us?

1406
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,960
You shouldn't have teamed up
with him.

1407
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,160
Even if I teamed up with you,
we wouldn't have had any money.

1408
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,190
- Right.
- Right?

1409
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,100
- Come on. What's this?
- We all should receive some.

1410
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,160
- Then we...
- Withdraw from the union, you two.

1411
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,370
We'll form a new union
and file a complaint next week.

1412
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,900
- This is absurd.
- Sae Ho is right.

1413
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,100
- It's not 1,000 or 5,000 seeds.
- They're not even cast members.

1414
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,400
- What is this? Had we known,
- Right.

1415
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,700
- we would've stayed too.
- That's right.

1416
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,040
- Raise your hand. One, two, three.
- Okay.

1417
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,540
- If you're opposed, don't.
- No. This isn't right.

1418
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,740
- I'm sorry.
- This is not fair.

1419
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,180
- Give us 10,000 seeds.
- We've come to the decision.

1420
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,550
- Let's play the game for now...
- How about 5,000 seeds?

1421
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,780
- to figure out...
- No, we deserve 10,000 seeds.

1422
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,680
how much 10,000 seeds are worth.

1423
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,850
- Let's check that out first.
- Let's figure it out.

1424
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,420
- Give us money if it's worth a lot.
- We'll see when we play it.

1425
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,920
You can say that later
when you find out its worth.

1426
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,820
(Seed Money Status)

1427
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,220
(Team Jong Min and DinDin: 15,000 seeds,)

1428
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,620
(Team Se Yoon and Joon: 15,000 seeds,
Team Sae Ho and Seon Ho: 0 seeds)

1429
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,060
Now, everyone, we'll begin
the Seed Money Mission.

1430
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,160
The first game you'll play is
Pull Toilet Paper.

1431
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,700
(What game is that?)

1432
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,070
(Move a glass full of water.)

1433
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:37,440
(When the toilet paper is torn,
you gain accumulated money.)

1434
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,310
Also, can you see the X mark
in the middle?

1435
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,640
If your glass stops there,

1436
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,380
you get no seeds,
no matter how much has accumulated.

1437
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,080
That's the worst.

1438
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,280
Decide the order, please.

1439
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,380
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Hey.

1440
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,450
- You go first since you're there.
- No.

1441
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,490
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No.

1442
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,890
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1443
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,860
- Remember. I'm a card to discard.
- Yes?

1444
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,090
- Okay.
- Watch closely.

1445
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,330
For your information,

1446
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,500
trains pass here by at times.

1447
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,730
When a train is passing by,
the ground may shake a bit.

1448
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,270
- That's your luck.
- Okay. Got it.

1449
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,400
- That line...
- When a train comes...

1450
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,570
Then it was their luck that
the shoot ended late last week.

1451
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:10,810
- Give us just 5,000 seeds.
- Right.

1452
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,610
- Give us just 5,000 seeds.
- He's eloquent.

1453
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,580
So we have to even do this.

1454
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,980
- Fill the rest using the pipette.
- Now I'll use the pipette.

1455
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,510
- Really? This delicately?
- Of course.

1456
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,620
(It's delicate work
to fill the glass to the brim.)

1457
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,750
- You can add some more, Se Yoon.
- You should add some more.

1458
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,280
- It doesn't overflow that easily.
- You can add a lot at once.

1459
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,620
- You can put all that in.
- Is there an expert here?

1460
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,090
I think we need an expert
to do this for us. Come, please.

1461
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:27,460
I can't trust him.

1462
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,790
- She must be a pipette expert.
- I added...

1463
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,660
- Seriously?
- Oh, my. She's bold.

1464
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,030
(Perfect)

1465
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,670
(She prepared the glass neatly
in one go.)

1466
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,640
- That was so accurate.
- She's incredibly bold.

1467
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,640
(They fell for her.
"She's an expert for a reason.")

1468
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,870
We'll begin now. Ready.

1469
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,310
(The first player: Se Yoon)

1470
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,010
Get back a little bit. You...

1471
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,110
- I need to block sound waves.
- We'll start now.

1472
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,250
No. You'll speak over there.

1473
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,580
- I won't speak. No, I won't.
- You'll scream like this.

1474
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,350
- Move aside a little. Legs.
- My legs are down below.

1475
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,650
If anyone disturbs me,
I'll kill him.

1476
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,190
- I mean it.
- Everyone is so sensitive.

1477
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,290
Everyone is so sensitive today.

1478
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,020
Let's begin now. Ready!

1479
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,090
Set.

1480
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,360
(The water moves on top of the glass
as soon as he begins.)

1481
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,800
- Oh, my gosh.
- He looks so serious.

1482
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,200
(He's putting his heart and soul
into this.)

1483
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,700
(Please)

1484
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,710
Wouldn't it be better
to pull it quickly?

1485
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,710
(The game makes the spectators
more nervous than the player.)

1486
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,510
(The toilet paper already started
being torn.)

1487
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,850
- A hundred seeds!
- A hundred seeds.

1488
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,120
Gosh. This game seems very hard.

1489
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,650
Should we really fill the glass
to the brim?

1490
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,020
I don't think I was very nervous
while playing it.

1491
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,590
It's 100 percent...
Go ahead and continue.

1492
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,860
Do you want me to be bold
or delicate?

1493
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,560
This is our first attempt,

1494
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,830
- so let's be bold this time.
- I'll be bold.

1495
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:40,930
Yes, be bold.

1496
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,200
- You can stop at 10,000 seeds.
- Let's begin.

1497
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,670
- I have a good feeling about this.
- Seon Ho, let's begin.

1498
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,070
- Ready!
- Hurry up. We don't have much time.

1499
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,140
- Pull it.
- It's better to pull it quickly.

1500
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,040
- Hey, in the end...
- Okay!

1501
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,440
(He boldly wetted the toilet paper.)

1502
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,740
- Hey, in the end...
- Okay!

1503
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,980
- Less than half of it is in.
- Not half of it is in.

1504
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,250
Let's just give them the money.
It's only 100 seeds.

1505
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,580
Now I see that
10,000 seeds is a great benefit.

1506
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,580
You were so lucky.

1507
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,050
All right. Let's begin.

1508
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,660
- The wind is blowing.
- Just pull it.

1509
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,490
- That's it. Pull boldly.
- That's good. Nice.

1510
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,130
- That's good. Keep going.
- Hey, this is...

1511
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:11,890
That's really good. Nice.

1512
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,200
(Timid and cautious hand movements)

1513
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,400
(100 seeds)

1514
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,330
- How is he so good at this?
- Jong Min, you're doing so well.

1515
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,730
(He's doing the best of all so far!)

1516
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,130
That's good. Keep going.

1517
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,300
(I can't let this go on.)

1518
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,900
Did you send a wedding invitation video
to everyone?

1519
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,840
Did you send a wedding invitation video
to everyone?

1520
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,170
"Hong Chul."

1521
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,580
"Hong Chul, I'm getting married."

1522
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,410
- Don't do that. Stop it.
- "Please come to my wedding."

1523
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,780
- "Hong Chul."
- You're doing great.

1524
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,320
- "Hong Chul, please come."
- Stop it.

1525
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,220
- Ignore him. You're doing well.
- "Hong Chul, please."

1526
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,390
- Gosh. Why is he so good at this?
- "Don't go to another wedding."

1527
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,890
"Please come to mine."

1528
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,020
(2,100 seeds)

1529
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,130
(Jong Min already reached
the X slot.)

1530
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,830
(If it stops on the X slot,)

1531
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,060
(his team has to start
with 0 seeds again.)

1532
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,670
Six, five...

1533
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:53,800
(It passed the X slot.)

1534
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,810
- Six, five, four, three...
- Six, five...

1535
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:57,810
(19,100 seeds)

1536
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,410
That was amazing.

1537
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,010
(Amazed)

1538
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,480
(Exclaiming with joy)

1539
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,680
(He's so excited
that he's lost for words.)

1540
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,080
- He gained 19,100 seeds.
- You should pull it like that.

1541
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,450
I'll bet my life on this.

1542
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,790
Even your life?

1543
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,620
All right. Let's begin.

1544
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,620
Ready. Set.

1545
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,560
- Don't start right away.
- Joon, use your muscles.

1546
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,490
Use your... It's not moving at all.

1547
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,760
(Joon's glass won't even budge.)

1548
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,830
(His face alone looks like
a national team player.)

1549
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,000
Oh, dear.

1550
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,740
- Zero seeds.
- You gained zero seeds.

1551
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,910
- Zero seeds.
- I'll show you what humiliation is.

1552
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:34,910
Right, DinDin.

1553
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:36,810
- Show them why you're an ace.
- We need to get more than 500.

1554
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:37,810
He'll begin now.

1555
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,880
Ready!

1556
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,780
It's over.

1557
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,120
(Will it be over just like this?)

1558
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,090
(He failed at a super high speed.)

1559
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,960
- Okay!
- It's in the 500 seeds slot.

1560
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,390
- No, it's 100 seeds.
- It's in the 500 seeds slot.

1561
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,160
- It crossed the line.
- It's 100 seeds.

1562
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,560
- It crossed the line.
- If you don't approve,

1563
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,000
Seon Ho shouldn't
get the money either.

1564
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:59,070
(Seon Ho's glass stopped
over the 0 and 100 seed slots.)

1565
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,400
(100 seeds?)

1566
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,900
- Okay.
- Forget it. We won't get it either.

1567
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,610
- We won't receive the money.
- We won't get it.

1568
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,970
(Taken aback)

1569
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,040
- We don't need it.
- We won't accept it.

1570
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,210
- They already have 15,000 seeds.
- What more do they want?

1571
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,280
- Seon Ho, you're doing so well.
- Indeed.

1572
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,350
- He's doing well, indeed.
- They already have 15,000 seeds.

1573
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:13,350
Ready. One, two, three.
(We'll make it work
without anyone's help.)

1574
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,420
- What does that mean?
- Oh, this?

1575
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,120
- It means we won't get the money.
- I see. Do it again, In 1, 2, 3.

1576
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,590
(We don't need it.)

1577
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:19,690
Okay. We'll take 100 seeds.

1578
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,860
(Team Jong Min and DinDin obtained
100 seeds.)

1579
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,130
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's begin.

1580
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,060
Ready.

1581
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,260
Pull it hard and quickly.

1582
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,030
- Then it'll be over shortly.
- It's moving.

1583
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,030
(Sae Ho moves his glass boldly
from the beginning.)

1584
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,370
- Oh, no. Stop. Slowly.
- It's moving.

1585
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,870
You're doing great, Sae Ho.

1586
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,810
- You should move it fast. Nice!
- No, he should move it slowly.

1587
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,240
- Slowly.
- It went down toward the back.

1588
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,910
- Slowly.
- That's unbelievable.

1589
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,050
(Let's go, Sae Ho!)

1590
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,910
- Sae Ho is good at this.
- This is amazing.

1591
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:46,920
(Sae Ho's glass moves forward
without stopping.)

1592
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,180
I'll let you talk
as much as you want.

1593
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,680
- It's getting close to the X slot.
- It's the X slot.

1594
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,090
(Sae Ho has already reached
the X slot.)

1595
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,890
(If the glass stops here,
he'll get no money.)

1596
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,090
(Precarious situation)

1597
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,360
(We didn't even receive
15,000 seeds.)

1598
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,230
(Please don't stop at the X slot.)

1599
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,130
(It overflowed.)

1600
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,600
- Okay.
- The X slot.

1601
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,740
(Sae Ho's glass stopped
right before the X slot.)

1602
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,700
(I made it.)

1603
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,700
Sae Ho, you're awesome.

1604
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,040
- How much is it?
- Oh, yes!

1605
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,210
(It barely avoided
crossing the line.)

1606
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,380
You gained 7,600 seeds.

1607
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,410
We'll move to the next location,

1608
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,650
where you will gain more seed money.

1609
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:20,820
(Seed Money Status)

1610
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:21,950
(Spring on 2 Days and 1 Night)

1611
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,120
I...

1612
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:25,850
I like you.

1613
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,890
Do you like me too?

1614
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:35,300
I want to bite you.

1615
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:38,300
(Go on a spring outing with us.)

1616
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,600
(They set off to the next location.)

1617
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,340
I guess
the teams don't move separately.

1618
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,070
- That's correct.
- Only when we play games?

1619
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:49,010
If that's the case, I'm happy
to be paired up with Sae Ho.

1620
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,580
- In that case...
- Had I known, I wouldn't have...

1621
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,750
avoided teaming up with Sae Ho.

1622
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,520
I would've teamed up
with Sae Ho too.

1623
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,250
- Me too.
- Hey, he's my partner.

1624
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,090
Had I known, I would've teamed up
with Sae Ho too.

1625
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,390
- I...
- We won't move separately?

1626
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:00,190
Since all of you are so sad
that you're not paired up with me,

1627
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,320
I'll meet Seon Ho alone
sometime this week.

1628
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,390
Sounds great.

1629
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,190
- I won't be in Seoul.
- Will you meet me?

1630
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,300
Where will you go?

1631
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,860
- I'm going to several areas.
- Hey, you...

1632
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,270
Really? I'm scheduled to go
to several areas too.

1633
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,770
Sae Ho rather likes it
when he arrives the day before the shoot.

1634
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,540
(You can never get away
from Joke Box.)

1635
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,010
(They arrive at the next location.)

1636
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,440
- Wait. We're going to a restaurant.
- We're going to a restaurant.

1637
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,840
- Pork belly?
- What's going on?

1638
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,410
Pork belly with water parsley sounds
so delicious.

1639
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,550
- Do we use our seed money?
- We only have 7,600 seeds.

1640
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,580
Joon,
let's spend all the money we have.

1641
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,480
- There's no tomorrow for us.
- Okay.

1642
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,250
(Will they get to eat pork belly
as they hope?)

1643
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:35,990
(They get off the bus
in a good mood for now.)

1644
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:39,560
(There are many places that serve
pork belly with water parsley.)

1645
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,900
It smells so good.

1646
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,730
- It smells so delicious.
- It's no joke.

1647
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,370
(Excited to max)

1648
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,140
Hold on.
Are we not going to a restaurant?

1649
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,400
- I guess we're not. Darn it.
- Oh, it smells so good.

1650
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,570
- We're not.
- We're not going...

1651
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:53,140
- We are. There's another place.
- No, you're wrong.

1652
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,780
- Where is that restaurant?
- Over there.

1653
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,180
No, we're not going there.

1654
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,250
Where are we going?

1655
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,310
- We're not going to a restaurant.
- Hey, we're here.

1656
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,450
- We're not eating food.
- But I didn't have breakfast.

1657
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:02,680
Hold on a second. This is...

1658
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,920
We're not going
toward any restaurants.

1659
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,920
Where are we going now?

1660
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,760
There are no restaurants that way!

1661
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,490
Joon, our cameras are over there.

1662
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:10,890
Gosh. What is going on?

1663
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:12,890
So we're not eating lunch.

1664
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,030
Then why did we get off
in front of a restaurant?

1665
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,570
They could've stopped the bus
over here.

1666
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,830
You could've parked the bus here.
Why did you let us off there?

1667
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:19,870
Right. It was a waste of gas.

1668
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,800
Why did you fool us?

1669
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,810
Why?

1670
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,870
You didn't have to let us off
in front of a restaurant.

1671
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,680
Oh, gosh.
They're going to make us work.

1672
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,280
We're going to do some work here.

1673
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,510
(He has a bad feeling.)

1674
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,220
(The place they came instead of
a restaurant around lunchtime is...)

1675
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,520
Oh, this is a water parsley field.

1676
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,520
- I really like water parsley.
- I love water parsley too.

1677
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,720
I like it more than you do.

1678
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,890
(Wondong water parsley)

1679
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,030
(The eco-friendly, chemical-free
Wondong water parsley is farmed...)

1680
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,390
(in a clean environment,
with underground water.)

1681
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,760
(Thus, it has
a great taste and aroma.)

1682
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,630
It smells amazing, right?

1683
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,330
- It smells so good.
- Look at this water parsley.

1684
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,070
So this is how they farm
water parsley.

1685
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,370
- It smells amazing.
- Now, let us eat food.

1686
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,240
- Let's go and eat.
- I love water parsley.

1687
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,570
But where is pork belly?
That matters more to us.

1688
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,010
- Pork belly is right here.
- I really like pork belly.

1689
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,040
- Is that right?
- It's right here.

1690
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,310
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1691
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,450
- It's 8-layered meat.
- It's famous for water parsley.

1692
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,920
Wondong is famous for water parsley.

1693
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,680
- Wondong water parsley is famous.
- It's famous, indeed.

1694
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,290
- Indeed.
- The farmers in Yangsan...

1695
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,260
are busy harvesting water parsley
as they're in season now.

1696
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,620
They must be very busy now.

1697
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,890
You'll harvest water parsley here...

1698
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:19,560
to earn more seed money.

1699
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,960
(What?)

1700
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,060
- Earn seed money...
- We should work here?

1701
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,160
by working?

1702
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,500
(The atmosphere
suddenly became frigid.)

1703
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,140
- We should work here?
- Is it like a part-time job?

1704
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,600
- Is it like volunteer work?
- Listen up.

1705
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,510
- Is it a penalty? We all work here?
- To be more exact...

1706
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,070
Is it like
the show, "Experience Life?"

1707
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,780
It's similar to that show.

1708
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,610
(Thinking)

1709
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,710
- The current price...
- We'll just work here?

1710
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,810
- of the Wondong water parsley...
- Yes.

1711
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,920
is 13 dollars per kilogram.

1712
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,990
- Per kilogram?
- Yes.

1713
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:47,490
We'll give you 1,000 seeds
per kilogram.

1714
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:48,820
- We'll pay you with seed money.
- That's not fair.

1715
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,890
And?

1716
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,660
We will pay you accordingly.

1717
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,030
- We will show you.
- How much should we pick?

1718
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,200
You will spend it right.

1719
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,100
- How much?
- I mean picking 10kg of it...

1720
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,300
- It's only ten dollars.
- Right.

1721
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,870
Water parsley is very light.

1722
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
That's right.

1723
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,240
- So you know.
- I do.

1724
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,970
- Okay.
- The most we can pick is...

1725
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:05,940
So they tell us to pick...

1726
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,380
Then we pick it all.

1727
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,780
If they tell us to pick...

1728
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,940
Pick all of this?

1729
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:11,350
Listen, you guys...

1730
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,550
- should get changed first.
- What?

1731
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,950
We have to? How hard can this be?

1732
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,550
It would be funny
if we get changed into hanbok.

1733
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,490
(Getting changed
into their working outfits)

1734
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,760
- Let's go.
- I was dressed up nicely before.

1735
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,030
Do we look like the characters
from "The Thieves?"

1736
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,530
Sae Ho must be hot.

1737
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,800
(The 6 water parsley farmers)

1738
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,030
It will go up to 17°C.

1739
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,030
We might get burned.

1740
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,800
(Work hard with bodies, not brain:
Power is all they got.)

1741
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,370
(Work less, earn more:
Tricks are the best way to win.)

1742
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,310
(Just earn seeds, no jokes:
Seriousness is their strategy.)

1743
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,040
- Let's go.
- That's a lot of parsley.

1744
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,680
Hold on. How many kilograms is that?

1745
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,140
That should be about 50kg.

1746
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,750
- All of these?
- Yes.

1747
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:48,120
We invited the water parsley expert
who will teach you how to pick.

1748
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,280
- He will teach us?
- Please step in.

1749
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,820
- Hello.
- Hello.

1750
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,660
- He's very good-looking.
- I know.

1751
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,320
- He's a young man.
- Hello.

1752
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,660
Please introduce yourself.

1753
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,330
I'm 26 years old.

1754
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:01,500
I'm Bae Yong Hyeon. I farm
water parsley here in Wondong.

1755
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,700
(He's young!)

1756
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,100
- It's not easy for a young man.
- He surely is young.

1757
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,940
- It's hard to farm at a young age.
- I know.

1758
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,740
- I work with my father.
- I see.

1759
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,510
Seeing my father as a farmer,
I wanted to continue his business.

1760
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,980
If we can pick all of these,
how many kilograms would it be?

1761
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,380
You can tell from a glance, right?

1762
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,510
- Around 400kg to 500kg.
- Gosh, really?

1763
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,350
Let's eat it all today.

1764
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:23,350
- Can you tell us how to pick it?
- Can you show us?

1765
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:25,120
Sure, let me show you.

1766
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,590
- Grab this part.
- Grab the root.

1767
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:30,020
- Chop the bottom part.
- Right, the bottom part.

1768
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,090
It's easier than I thought. Yes?

1769
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:35,130
It won't be valuable
if you pull out the whole root.

1770
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,630
- Really? Why?
- It slows down the working speed.

1771
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,630
(You can't pull out the whole root.)

1772
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,770
Shall we start?

1773
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:42,700
You will start picking water parsley
by teams.

1774
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,210
Give me one box over there.

1775
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,210
- It's facing the other side.
- Isn't it correct?

1776
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,510
Hyun Woo.

1777
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,450
Please turn on my song,
"Shy Ddoong."

1778
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:54,580
That's funny.

1779
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,890
(Shy working as a farmer)

1780
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:00,360
(A novice farmer working
with a sickle)

1781
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,960
(I'll take this one.)

1782
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,990
I got it.

1783
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,660
(It's time to pick water parsley.)

1784
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,600
We actually have to sell it.

1785
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,800
Let's not be greedy.
Let's work properly.

1786
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:18,070
- I saw a snail.
- Make it valuable as a product.

1787
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,970
- Okay.
- I see a snail here.

1788
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,650
What is this?
Do we just pick water parsley?

1789
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,550
- This isn't even a penalty.
- I know.

1790
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,820
(Reality that makes them
keep doubting)

1791
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,960
- This sickle works so well.
- Right. It's the best.

1792
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,260
Sickles these days work very well.
They didn't work well in the past.

1793
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:38,990
The old sickles.

1794
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:40,930
I'm getting the hang of it.

1795
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,400
(They even ended up singing.)

1796
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,670
Nothing?

1797
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:50,000
Everyone.

1798
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,170
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

1799
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:55,380
May I have your attention?

1800
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,580
What? I see a table being set.

1801
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,950
- What?
- I see a table.

1802
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:04,590
- What is it?
- What is that?

1803
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,290
Everyone, I'm sure you're hungry.

1804
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,860
- Yes.
- We prepared pork belly...

1805
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,490
with water parsley as your snack
so you can work harder.

1806
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:14,800
(A table full of pork belly
as their snack)

1807
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:16,800
(It's tasty as it is.)

1808
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,400
(But it tastes even better
when eaten after work.)

1809
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,270
- But not everyone can eat it.
- Why not?

1810
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,810
This mission for the snack
is called Farmer's Quiz.

1811
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,080
- What?
- Really?

1812
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,310
- Farmer's?
- Yes.

1813
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,880
- What is that?
- You should start.

1814
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,750
You have one chance...

1815
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,320
to work on one quiz
when you submit 1kg...

1816
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,050
- of water parsley.
- Okay.

1817
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:44,360
The team that gets the answer
can eat the pork belly...

1818
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,690
- until the next team gets the quiz.
- My gosh, all right.

1819
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,760
Okay.

1820
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,800
(Getting busy with picking)

1821
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,030
I think this should be 1kg.

1822
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:52,770
You have to go back and start
picking water parsley again...

1823
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,870
once the next winner gets the quiz.

1824
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,340
The snack time is over...

1825
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,910
once the food is all gone.

1826
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,110
(The snack time is over
when all the food is gone.)

1827
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,910
We will pay you money
based on the water parsley...

1828
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:07,150
that you picked excluding
the ones you submit for the quiz.

1829
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,450
- Please take note of that.
- I see.

1830
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,350
If you think you know the answer,

1831
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:14,060
you can submit
the water parsley here.

1832
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,260
I have a question.

1833
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,690
You take away the water parsley
if we give wrong answers?

1834
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,100
- That's right. It'll be gone.
- Okay.

1835
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,300
(Be careful when you submit it
as it can be taken away.)

1836
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,770
- This one is about a fairy tale.
- A fairy tale.

1837
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:28,500
In the fairy tale,
"The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl,"

1838
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:32,940
the magpies and crows
found the broken couple pitiful.

1839
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,910
So they make a bridge
once a year on July 7...

1840
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:39,710
for them to reunite.

1841
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,720
If so,

1842
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:45,420
why did the couple break up?

1843
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:48,560
Why did they break up?

1844
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:51,160
- What?
- Maybe they didn't get along.

1845
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,630
- Jong Min, this should be...
- They weren't compatible?

1846
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,830
No.

1847
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,930
They must have fought
the day before they broke up.

1848
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,370
- Just keep working.
- I should.

1849
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,440
The question is quite hard.

1850
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,240
I mean...

1851
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:06,670
Don't you think this is the reason?

1852
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,080
I think that must be the answer.
The two of them were different.

1853
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,450
Submit 1kg of water parsley.

1854
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:11,910
(They have to submit 1kg of water parsley
if they want to answer.)

1855
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,280
- This must be more than 1kg.
- It's far heavier than 1kg.

1856
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,190
- Okay.
- It's 1kg.

1857
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:18,450
What is the answer?

1858
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:20,760
- Their parents were against it.
- The parents didn't want them.

1859
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,390
- These two...
- They come from different families.

1860
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:23,620
- The parents were against it...
- Right.

1861
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,830
because of their class difference.

1862
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,230
Incorrect. You can go back
to picking water parsley.

1863
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,230
My gosh.

1864
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:30,970
- "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl."
- All right.

1865
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:32,030
Three.

1866
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,400
- Two, one.
- Parents weren't against it.

1867
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,570
- Okay.
- They were in a rut.

1868
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,600
My gosh.

1869
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,810
- What was that?
- What?

1870
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,970
They didn't even meet often.
How can they be in a rut?

1871
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,780
- Go back to work.
- They are a couple.

1872
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,380
Isn't it something like the parents
being against their marriage?

1873
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,020
Right! Parents going against.

1874
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,950
(They just gave
the same wrong answer.)

1875
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:52,990
Why would they break up
if it's not about their parents?

1876
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:55,590
- Go for it then.
- You have to go for it.

1877
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:56,660
(They can only think of cheating.)

1878
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:58,090
But you said it was because
of the parents.

1879
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:59,230
- No, we didn't.
- No.

1880
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,500
What was your answer then?

1881
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:06,270
You never know.

1882
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,400
- You can go back.
- Please grill two pieces of it.

1883
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,670
So whoever gets the answer first
can eat it right away.

1884
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,210
(Will they be able to eat
pork belly today?)

1885
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,910
Please give us a hint.

1886
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,210
A hint?

1887
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,410
It said that the Great Jade Emperor
was not happy...

1888
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,520
when the sweet couple
was fallen into this...

1889
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:24,720
after they got married.

1890
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:28,760
I can never forgive you.

1891
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:31,390
I'm afraid the innocent people...

1892
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:33,130
might take after your behavior.

1893
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,830
I am so sorry.

1894
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:36,800
Father, please forgive us.

1895
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,800
(What kind of sin
did the couple commit?)

1896
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,770
What is it?
I have no idea what it is.

1897
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:43,070
Did they kiss or something?

1898
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,610
Why would the emperor
get angry at them for kissing?

1899
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,010
- He must have been jealous.
- My gosh!

1900
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,840
He says it's because the emperor
was jealous!

1901
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,610
- For kissing.
- My goodness.

1902
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,750
(Team Jong Min and DinDin heading
to answer after getting the hint)

1903
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,250
They did something by falling
into the sweetness of newlyweds.

1904
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,190
(Will someone get to eat pork belly
with water parsley?)

1905
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:58,820
They fell into the sweetness
of newlyweds.

1906
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:00,460
So they did...

1907
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,560
They must have neglected their jobs.

1908
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,290
They didn't do their jobs...

1909
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:06,860
- because they were so in love.
- They didn't.

1910
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:13,000
(Will they get the answer?)

1911
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Correct.

1912
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,440
- Let's grill it.
- Okay.

1913
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,810
(Water parsley pork belly is ours.)

1914
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:22,440
The couple fell into the sweetness
of newlyweds.

1915
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,280
They didn't do their jobs.

1916
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:29,020
I'm afraid the innocent people
might become lazy like you two!

1917
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,990
- Hey, come on.
- I was going to say that.

1918
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,360
(Why didn't you?)

1919
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:35,590
(Team Jong Min and DinDin
head toward the snack table.)

1920
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:36,990
We got it. Goodness.

1921
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:39,590
Jong Min, should I grill this?

1922
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,100
- Should we add kimchi too?
- Here?

1923
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:44,000
- No, water parsley first.
- Right, water parsley.

1924
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:48,240
(Grilling)

1925
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,770
First, you hold the water parsley.

1926
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:52,170
(Smiling widely)

1927
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,510
(As they start eating,
the next question starts.)

1928
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,810
- Everyone, it's the next one.
- Okay.

1929
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:59,680
- Go.
- It's about fashion.

1930
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,820
- Okay.
- Sure.

1931
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:04,150
This refers to a pair of thick pants
filled with cotton.

1932
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:07,720
It also means a silly person
who isn't special at all.

1933
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:12,190
It was a line in the movie,
"Tazza: The High Rollers."

1934
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:14,330
- What is the word?
- We have to eat it quickly.

1935
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,600
It's what Ah Gwi said to Go Ni.

1936
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,030
(It looks like Se Yoon knows
the answer.)

1937
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:27,940
(But he forgot an obstacle
was holding him back.)

1938
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,010
Let's go.

1939
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:30,910
- Sure.
- Okay.

1940
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:32,050
We got the answer this time.

1941
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:33,950
Hey.

1942
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,750
(It looks like
he's sure of the answer.)

1943
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,350
- Okay. It's 1kg. Measure it.
- All right.

1944
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:39,420
Please measure it.

1945
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,720
Do we say it in full
or in three syllables?

1946
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,820
I think we can say it
in three syllables.

1947
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,930
- Then "baji."
- Yes.

1948
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:45,990
- The answer...
- Three, two,

1949
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,090
is "bingdari hatbaji."

1950
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,830
- Hatbaji.
- Hatbaji!

1951
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:50,670
- Hatbaji!
- Hot pants.

1952
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,270
- Correct!
- Let's go. Get out.

1953
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:53,400
(Answer: Hatbaji)

1954
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,440
Hot pants.

1955
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,170
- Correct!
- Let's go. Get out.

1956
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,340
Should we take this?

1957
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,270
- Hurry up. Let's eat.
- Should we take this?

1958
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:03,010
(He dips it in the oil sauce.)

1959
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,550
Hurry up. Let's eat.

1960
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,580
(Get out.)

1961
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,950
(He eats the last bunch
of water parsley.)

1962
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:12,150
Bring the lighter.

1963
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:13,820
The water parsley is so good.

1964
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:14,990
Grill all the meat.

1965
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:16,190
Try the water parsley.

1966
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,390
(They have to cook
since the previous team...)

1967
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:19,490
(only cooked a small amount.)

1968
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:21,460
- The water parsley is so good.
- Hurry back, DinDin.

1969
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,730
The question will be
given immediately.

1970
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:25,000
- Immediately?
- Se Yoon!

1971
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,400
- Why are you asking immediately?
- I only had one.

1972
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:28,240
- I didn't even eat one.
- Quickly wrap them.

1973
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,970
Hurry and eat.

1974
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:31,010
- Hurry and eat.
- Se Yoon!

1975
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:32,010
- What?
- Please put the water parsley.

1976
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:33,070
That's mine.

1977
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,210
It's mine.

1978
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:35,940
- Hurry!
- Why are you doing it immediately?

1979
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,040
- Give us the question!
- Okay.

1980
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,150
(They're each talking
about what they want.)

1981
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:41,650
This question is about sports.

1982
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:42,820
Sports. I know sports.

1983
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,020
What color...

1984
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:48,460
is on the ten-point target
in archery?

1985
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:55,300
(Team Jong Min and DinDin
go for it right away.)

1986
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,970
They're coming out. Hurry.

1987
01:04:57,970 --> 01:04:59,500
(Team Sae Ho and Seon Ho
also go for it.)

1988
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:03,040
(Eating)

1989
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:05,140
(It's not their business for now.)

1990
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,440
It's too easy.

1991
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:08,610
- We got it.
- Okay.

1992
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,810
- All right.
- Red.

1993
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:11,850
Is it correct?

1994
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:13,980
- It's wrong!
- Us.

1995
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,820
- Us.
- Right. It's not red.

1996
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,650
- It's 1kg.
- Okay.

1997
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,320
One, two, three.

1998
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,450
Yellow. Let's go.

1999
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,790
(Answer: Yellow)

2000
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:24,160
- That's correct.
- Okay.

2001
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,860
- What was that?
- We'll take this.

2002
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,060
Get out!

2003
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:29,160
- Come back in.
- Get out.

2004
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,570
Get out. You need to get out.

2005
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,800
(The water parsley pork belly restaurant
has no waiting line.)

2006
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,500
Put lots of water parsley.

2007
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,400
Get out quickly!

2008
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,110
We should get the next question.
Get out quickly!

2009
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:39,210
(Putting all the water parsley)

2010
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:40,240
(They finally get to taste
the snack after 3 tries.)

2011
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,540
(It's raw.)

2012
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,110
It's too raw.

2013
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,850
It was a bad timing.

2014
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:48,380
(Team Jong Min and DinDin came back
to harvest the water parsley.)

2015
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,080
We should get more.

2016
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:53,090
- No, Jong Min.
- Yes?

2017
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:55,590
Jong Min.

2018
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:56,860
Hey.

2019
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,790
(Sae Ho and Seon Ho's water parsley)

2020
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,630
(He steals their water parsley
while they're not around.)

2021
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:03,730
Whose are those?

2022
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:06,800
- That's theirs.
- It's okay. They didn't see.

2023
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,270
- That's not the issue. It's theirs.
- They didn't see it.

2024
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,010
The next question!

2025
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,010
(I'm glad you're on my team.)

2026
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,810
(The crime scene)

2027
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:16,980
We can eat it.

2028
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,150
- It's not cooked.
- The next question!

2029
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:20,180
(They're enjoying the food
without realizing what's happening.)

2030
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:22,050
It's not cooked. It's almost raw.

2031
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:23,780
- Just eat them.
- Really?

2032
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:27,360
- The next question!
- This question...

2033
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,920
- is about music.
- Music. Nice.

2034
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,420
(The topic of the question: Music)

2035
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,590
I'll play the song first.

2036
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:37,230
(Round and round)

2037
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:41,200
(Let's go round and dance)

2038
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:43,070
(Let's clap our hands)

2039
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,110
(And sing)

2040
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:49,080
(Let's have fun dancing)

2041
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:53,110
(Ring-a-ring)

2042
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:57,080
(Ring-a-ring)

2043
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,790
(One, two, three...)

2044
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,790
This children's song
is called "Round and Round."

2045
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:06,690
How many "ring-a" did you hear?

2046
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:09,030
(Running)

2047
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:10,260
No.

2048
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,730
- Okay. We got it.
- Okay.

2049
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,200
- How many...
- We got it.

2050
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:14,270
Eleven times.

2051
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,340
Wrong!

2052
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,910
- Why?
- I got it!

2053
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:18,910
- I got it!
- It's "ring-a."

2054
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:21,280
- I got it!
- It's "ring-a."

2055
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,710
- Okay. I got it.
- Okay.

2056
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,150
- Thank you.
- Ten times.

2057
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,850
Thank you. Ten times.

2058
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:27,620
Correct.

2059
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,280
Get out.

2060
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:33,350
(Let's check the answer.)

2061
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:41,800
(Ring-a-ring-a)

2062
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,370
(There were 10 of them.)

2063
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:48,140
(It's Team Se Yoon
and Joon's turn to eat again.)

2064
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,810
- Come on.
- Come on.

2065
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:51,940
Why did you do that?

2066
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,240
(The ssamjang fell
as he ate in a rush.)

2067
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,480
- What?
- The ssamjang. Hey!

2068
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,710
(They will be eating ssamjang
with dirt from now on.)

2069
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:57,880
Go.

2070
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:00,610
This question is about dialects.

2071
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,680
(The topic of this question:
Dialects)

2072
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,620
In the Gyeongsang dialect,

2073
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:08,790
there is an expression,
"sse comes out."

2074
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:10,990
It means you're doing something...

2075
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:14,360
so hard that this comes out.

2076
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:17,260
What does "sse" mean?

2077
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:20,200
(Let's go.)

2078
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,640
- "Sse comes out."
- We're going.

2079
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,510
(Team Sae Ho and Seon Ho head out
without hesitation.)

2080
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:27,040
- We got it, right?
- Okay.

2081
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:30,710
"Sse comes out" means it's so hard
that the cow's horn comes out.

2082
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,510
- Cow's horn.
- He's from "You Quiz on the Block."

2083
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:35,050
(Answer: Cow's horn)

2084
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,450
- Wrong.
- It's wrong?

2085
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:40,520
- Hint!
- Is it an object?

2086
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,460
- Hint!
- Is it an object?

2087
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:44,490
(They have no idea.)

2088
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,160
- I'll give you a hint.
- Yes.

2089
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:49,900
It's a part of the body.

2090
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,000
(A part of the body?)

2091
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,070
"Sse comes out."

2092
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:56,040
It's so hard
that something comes out.

2093
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,740
- They ate all the meat.
- "Sse comes out."

2094
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,270
One, two, three. Teeth come out.

2095
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:02,480
- Teeth.
- Wrong!

2096
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,250
Let's go! It's our turn.

2097
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:06,810
- Arm!
- Wrong.

2098
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,120
I got it. Eyeball.

2099
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:11,390
- Mouth.
- Ears!

2100
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:12,690
I got it.

2101
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:13,850
Nose.

2102
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:15,620
They're really bad.

2103
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:19,360
This will take a long time.
Let's go.

2104
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,700
- Arm.
- It's one word.

2105
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:25,800
(They become happier
as the others keep trying.)

2106
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:28,100
They're eating a lot.

2107
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,440
(They're enjoying the food as
they got there at the right time.)

2108
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,470
I'm full.

2109
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:33,270
(It's empty.)

2110
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:35,480
- We got it.
- Will you go?

2111
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,010
- No. Tongue.
- What is it?

2112
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,610
- There's only one.
- They got it.

2113
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:40,650
- Tongue.
- Correct.

2114
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:42,150
- Get out.
- Get out.

2115
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:43,650
- Get out.
- It was the tongue.

2116
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,920
- I'm full.
- We're full.

2117
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,990
Right.

2118
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:49,220
They ate all the water parsley.

2119
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:51,160
I'm so full.

2120
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,230
(Team Se Yoon and Joon had a feast.)

2121
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,560
Joon, this is the next menu.

2122
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,670
They say people who sell meat
kept this for themselves...

2123
01:09:57,670 --> 01:09:59,470
because it was so delicious.

2124
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:01,170
- Leftover meat?
- We'll give you leftover meat...

2125
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:02,940
and thin-sliced pork belly.

2126
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:05,210
Let me know if there's naengmeon.

2127
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:06,970
(They want dessert already.)

2128
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,840
- We enjoyed it, right?
- Yes.

2129
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:10,740
The next question
will be given right away...

2130
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:11,880
once you go inside.

2131
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:14,520
Wait. They won't be able to eat
if we don't go in.

2132
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,450
Let's go in a bit later.

2133
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:17,790
(We're full. Let's get some rest.)

2134
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:21,520
I ate so much. It's so satisfying.

2135
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,190
Let's go.

2136
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:26,790
The next question
is about geography.

2137
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,200
This mountain is known to have
different names for each season.

2138
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,630
In summer, it's called
Mount Pongnae,

2139
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:35,770
in fall, it's called Mount Poongak,

2140
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,640
and in winter,
it's called Mount Gaegol.

2141
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:43,740
What is this mountain's name
in spring?

2142
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,050
(The name of this mountain
in spring...)

2143
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:48,180
(is Mount Kumgang.)

2144
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:52,250
What is this mountain's name
in spring?

2145
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,350
Okay. You know it, right?

2146
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,460
- Mount Chiak.
- What?

2147
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,730
How do we know this?

2148
01:10:58,030 --> 01:10:59,060
I know.

2149
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,790
(They won't be getting
this question correct so soon.)

2150
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,530
- Don't you know it?
- It's a very well-known name.

2151
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,230
- We know it, but we're not going.
- Really?

2152
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:08,100
- We'll wait for the leftover meat.
- We'll wait for the leftover meat.

2153
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,140
I have no idea.

2154
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,270
Give us a hint.

2155
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:12,540
This mountain...

2156
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:16,310
has 12,000 peaks.

2157
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:18,780
- It's Mount Kumgang.
- It's not Mount Chiak.

2158
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,680
(Laughing)

2159
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,720
It's Mount Kumgang.

2160
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,690
What is it called in spring?

2161
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:26,520
(Mount Pongnae, Mount Poongak,
Mount Gaegol)

2162
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,360
It's Mount Kumgang.

2163
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,260
Isn't it Mount Kumgang?

2164
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,830
Let's go.

2165
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,930
(Let's go!)

2166
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,260
(This mountain has a different name
for each season.)

2167
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,400
(What is this mountain's name
in spring?)

2168
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,470
Put it there.

2169
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:42,200
- One, two, three. Mount Kumgang.
- Mount Kumgang.

2170
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,000
It's Mount Kumgang in spring.

2171
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:45,570
Correct.

2172
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:46,640
(Answer: Mount Kumgang)

2173
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,810
Thank you.

2174
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,380
Get out.

2175
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,050
(Team Sae Ho and Seon Ho
gets their food.)

2176
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:52,150
It's Mount Kumgang in spring.

2177
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:53,850
- It's perfect.
- It's nice.

2178
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,520
How nice.

2179
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:56,950
Nice.

2180
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,950
This question is about cartoons.

2181
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:03,620
Today's children
have Teenieping and Pororo.

2182
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:07,330
In the 1980s,
the most famous character...

2183
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:09,160
was Dooly the Little Dinosaur
for children.

2184
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,900
Where is the hometown of Dooly,

2185
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,130
the first Korean animation character?

2186
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:16,170
- Do you know?
- I do.

2187
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:17,670
(I know!)

2188
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:19,670
- Do you know it?
- I know.

2189
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:21,410
- It's my town.
- What?

2190
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,210
It's my town.
I went there many times.

2191
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:26,050
(He quickly eats another piece
as they might get the answer.)

2192
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,220
My town is Ssangmun-dong.

2193
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,920
- Wrong!
- What was that?

2194
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,980
The hometown?

2195
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:33,520
(Ssangmun-dong is
where Go Gil Dong lives.)

2196
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,720
Hey. Okay, let's go.

2197
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:37,960
I'm sorry. We'll get to eat again.

2198
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:39,460
Prices are high these days.
Gireum-dong.

2199
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:40,990
- Isn't it right?
- Right.

2200
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,330
- Gireum.
- Wrong!

2201
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:45,470
- He lives in Gireum Station.
- Why would he live in a station?

2202
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:47,170
He really lives in Gireum Station.

2203
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:48,200
He's homeless?

2204
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,270
Let's add the meat.

2205
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:51,770
(They add more meat relaxedly.)

2206
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:55,510
Dooly is actually Korean.

2207
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,180
- Is it in the song?
- He goes to space to find his mom.

2208
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:00,450
(He sings the lyrics.)

2209
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:01,750
He came on a glacier.

2210
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:05,320
(He remembered
that Dooly came on a glacier.)

2211
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:06,920
- The Antarctic?
- The Antarctic?

2212
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:09,320
- Let's go. I think it's right.
- The Antarctic?

2213
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:10,820
I got it!

2214
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,460
I know!

2215
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,060
(Rushing)

2216
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:16,260
- I know.
- It's our turn.

2217
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,330
Go on.

2218
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:18,800
He came on a glacier.

2219
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,800
The Antarctic.

2220
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,240
- Correct.
- Yes!

2221
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:23,440
- Get out!
- Get out.

2222
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:30,410
(Dooly came to Korea
from the Antarctic on a glacier.)

2223
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,610
- Get out!
- Get out.

2224
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:33,680
(They try to eat
at least one more piece.)

2225
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,950
Why did you eat so much?

2226
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:36,120
It's Gireum Station.

2227
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:39,420
I read it on a blog or somewhere.

2228
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,490
- Why did you eat so much of it?
- What? All of it is gone!

2229
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:43,560
- Gosh!
- All of it is gone. What is this?

2230
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,230
- There's nothing to eat.
- I can stop eating.

2231
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:47,130
It's so good.

2232
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:50,460
This time,
it's an arithmetic question.

2233
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,330
- I'm confident!
- You're lying.

2234
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:54,270
- I practiced.
- This question...

2235
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:56,740
was actually given out
in an elementary school.

2236
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:59,040
They won't be able to get it.
It'll be confusing.

2237
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:03,440
Seon Ho went around a park
of a circumference of 1.3km...

2238
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:06,150
every single day.

2239
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:09,820
How much distance
did Seon Ho cover...

2240
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,550
for two weeks?

2241
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:13,050
How would we know that?

2242
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:16,260
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

2243
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,590
(Using his fingers)

2244
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,730
That's 14 days.
Just calculate it for 10 days.

2245
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,930
It's 1.3km times 14, right?
I'm smart, aren't I?

2246
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,830
But I don't know
how to multiply numbers!

2247
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,270
I feel upset!

2248
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:27,700
- It's 182.
- That's 50. Let's go with 182.

2249
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,440
(Team Sae Ho and Seon Ho
seems to be done with calculating.)

2250
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,570
- It's 18.2km.
- I feel upset!

2251
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:31,640
(Hurrying)

2252
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,840
I know what to do,
but it's so upsetting!

2253
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:36,980
Here's the answer. It's 18.2km.

2254
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,950
- Correct.
- Okay!

2255
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:40,710
(Having the kimchi at least)

2256
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:41,980
Get out.

2257
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,150
- Come on.
- Thank you.

2258
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,690
There was no meat at all.

2259
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:47,020
- Grill a lot of meat.
- We'll be grilling the meat.

2260
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,020
How was it 18.2km?
I tried to calculate it.

2261
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,220
All right, everyone.

2262
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,830
As you might want more,
we'll serve you...

2263
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:54,700
fried rice with
the leftover ingredients.

2264
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,230
We need to have some carbs.

2265
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,230
Could we get a bowl of naengmyeon
and a Coke Zero?

2266
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,040
- This question is based on food.
- Right.

2267
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,440
- Okay.
- Soogeun tea...

2268
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,810
is good for detoxification.

2269
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:09,810
It's a tea made by boiling
this vegetable.

2270
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,910
- What tea?
- Let's go.

2271
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:12,210
In 2021,

2272
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:15,280
a movie with the name
of this vegetable was released.

2273
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,350
What is this vegetable?

2274
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,490
(He figured it out.)

2275
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:20,320
- Do you know what it is?
- Water parsley.

2276
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:21,720
The movie, "Minari."

2277
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:23,020
- What is it?
- Water parsley.

2278
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:24,790
It was water parsley.

2279
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:26,290
(Darn it.)

2280
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:27,960
How would we not know this?

2281
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,330
It would be strange
not to mention this.

2282
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:30,360
- Correct.
- Yes!

2283
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,830
It's perfect.
They got the meat grilled.

2284
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,540
(The meat was grilled
right at that moment.)

2285
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:37,200
We will serve you
the ingredients for the fried rice.

2286
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,940
- We'll just eat the meat.
- It's just the ingredients.

2287
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:41,210
- Right.
- Let's get it right...

2288
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:42,440
- when the other teams cook it.
- Sure.

2289
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,040
I think some of ours was stolen.

2290
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:46,350
Almost half of ours was stolen.

2291
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:47,880
(Peeking)

2292
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:48,880
(He moves closer to
Se Yoon and Joon's water parsley.)

2293
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,850
(Stealing a bunch of water parsley)

2294
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,620
(He instinctively spots
the scene of theft.)

2295
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,590
(Cursing with his eyes)

2296
01:15:58,690 --> 01:15:59,690
You're funny.

2297
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:01,860
(Feeling very embarrassed)

2298
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:03,300
Why are you so funny?

2299
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,360
(Silent pressure)

2300
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:06,370
Why are you so funny?

2301
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:07,370
Sae Ho.

2302
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:10,040
- I returned it.
- No.

2303
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,110
- Done, right?
- Sae Ho.

2304
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:13,670
- You should stop now.
- You stole more than that.

2305
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:15,080
Fine. I'll get some from here.

2306
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,810
(Returning with
Jong Min and DinDin's water parsley)

2307
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,750
- Let's not be like that.
- That team doesn't work at all.

2308
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:23,720
This question is based on
world history.

2309
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,220
- That's a good one.
- Let's go!

2310
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:26,790
I'm confident!

2311
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:30,290
Gojong was enthroned
in the Joseon Dynasty,

2312
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:33,030
and former president
Lincoln announced...

2313
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:37,200
The Emancipation Proclamation
in 1863.

2314
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,070
Also, In London,

2315
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:41,500
the subway system was opened
for the first time.

2316
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,700
That was very early.

2317
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:46,040
The subway system was made
to reduce traffic congestion.

2318
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:49,740
The idea to make it
came from this certain animal.

2319
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,610
What is this animal?

2320
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:53,980
What is this animal?

2321
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,050
You know the answer?

2322
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,350
(Struggling)

2323
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:57,950
(He goes to answer the question
while forcing out his heavy body.)

2324
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:00,390
Subway was the one
to make it, right?

2325
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,720
- We're going to eat now.
- Subway.

2326
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,190
What a relief.

2327
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:07,090
All right, sir.
It's either the mole or worm.

2328
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:09,330
The mole. The worm. Okay.

2329
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:10,800
It's the mole. Mole.

2330
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:13,000
How did you know?
His face didn't change at all.

2331
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,200
Will you go with mole?

2332
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,270
- It's the mole.
- It's the mole.

2333
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:17,870
- Mole.
- Mole.

2334
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,340
- Mole?
- It's the mole.

2335
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,110
(They go with mole
as the final answer.)

2336
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,210
Correct.

2337
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:26,010
You should stop eating.
You're going to get sick.

2338
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:28,280
- You ate a lot.
- What? There are three pieces left.

2339
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,620
Put that piece down
so we can have two each.

2340
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,990
Put that piece down
so we can have two each.

2341
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:35,120
(Eating as much as he can
before going)

2342
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,590
The fried rice hasn't even been...

2343
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:38,660
Please make us some fried rice.

2344
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,260
We can just have it with the rice.

2345
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,630
- Try some first.
- We can just eat it like this.

2346
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:46,030
This question should be for
the fried rice.

2347
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:48,000
- We should get another one.
- It's based on reflexes.

2348
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,740
- We should try the fried rice.
- Let's go.

2349
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:53,740
Say five words that start
and end with the same syllable.

2350
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:56,010
- You'll get five seconds.
- We're next.

2351
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,680
Don't do it yet.

2352
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,280
What? The chauffeur service number.

2353
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,020
Eat. We have to eat.

2354
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,650
That's too easy.

2355
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,790
Squid, goose, tomato, Switzerland.

2356
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:07,250
- I'll start.
- You have to say it on your own.

2357
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,490
One, two, three.

2358
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:10,160
- Five, four,
- Goose, Sunday, tomato,

2359
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,660
- three...
- Switzerland, Yeoksam Station.

2360
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,160
(I got it, right?)

2361
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,590
- Correct.
- Okay!

2362
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,330
(Taking away the spoon)

2363
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:19,000
- Let's have some together.
- Go away!

2364
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:21,330
- Go away!
- I made all of it.

2365
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:22,470
Thank you.

2366
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,640
Go away!

2367
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,310
(They get kicked out
after having just a few bites.)

2368
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:27,870
- Great.
- The spoon.

2369
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:30,010
(Taking a bite)

2370
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,040
Gosh, it's good.

2371
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,080
- It's good?
- Yes.

2372
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,180
I loved watching
"Extraordinary Attorney Woo."

2373
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:36,250
"These words sound the same
even when they're flipped."

2374
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,390
"Switzerland, goose,
Yeoksam Station, tomato."

2375
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,120
Are you done?

2376
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,350
(Jong Min's team didn't collect
as much as the other teams.)

2377
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,360
- Should we steal some?
- No.

2378
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:44,830
Let's play fair.

2379
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:45,890
- Really?
- Yes.

2380
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:47,260
They stole ours, right?

2381
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,930
- They stole ours, right?
- A little bit.

2382
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,000
See? They stole ours.

2383
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,870
Forget it. Just give it to them.

2384
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:54,500
(Stealing back a big bunch)

2385
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:56,670
Hey!

2386
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:58,340
Put it back!

2387
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,340
(What are you doing?)

2388
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:00,710
You stole ours!

2389
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:02,980
- What are you saying?
- He said you stole ours!

2390
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:04,910
- Hey, let's eat.
- They stole it just like that?

2391
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:06,510
Hey! It's empty!

2392
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:08,780
They're playing it dirty.

2393
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,850
(They're all busy
stealing from empty spots.)

2394
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:12,020
That's just too much.

2395
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,950
We were told that you guys
stole ours!

2396
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,220
What on earth are you saying?

2397
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,620
Does taking this much make sense?

2398
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,620
(Taking back everything)

2399
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:18,630
(Empty)

2400
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:19,860
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

2401
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:21,960
Are you playing games with me?
What are you doing?

2402
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,160
Hurry up and put it back.

2403
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,330
What are you doing?

2404
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:28,100
(He belatedly spots
the fried rice being stolen.)

2405
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:30,570
Gosh, that's hot.

2406
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,640
- We had this much.
- No way.

2407
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,840
- It's true. We had this much.
- No way.

2408
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:35,910
We had this much.

2409
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:36,910
(They end up
reaching with an agreement.)

2410
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:38,450
Gosh, I couldn't even eat!

2411
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:41,880
All right, everyone.
There were people who wanted this.

2412
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:45,320
We'll end with one last question
for the Coke Zero.

2413
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:47,650
Gosh! I want it so bad!

2414
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:48,660
What about us?

2415
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,490
- You can answer it too.
- Okay.

2416
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:54,130
The Coke Zero
will be for 3kg of water parsley.

2417
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,430
It's for 3kg?

2418
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:58,670
DinDin's team has to pay
more than half of what they have.

2419
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:01,370
This question is based on
a living creature.

2420
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:03,840
This fish is known to be precious
as gold...

2421
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,240
and has the nickname, "geumtae."

2422
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:09,940
Based on the season
and the way it is processed,

2423
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:12,480
it has many different names.

2424
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,020
Say six of this fish's name.

2425
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:18,220
- Six?
- Six?

2426
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:20,450
You must pay 3kg.

2427
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:21,860
I know this one.

2428
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:24,520
- I got it!
- What was that?

2429
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:26,030
- How much do we have to pay?
- You have to pay 3kg.

2430
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,030
It's 3kg right now.

2431
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,530
- Okay.
- Okay.

2432
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:30,000
- Should I go first?
- Just one person must answer.

2433
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,400
- Why?
- What?

2434
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,530
- We're on the same team!
- We're on the same team!

2435
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:35,100
- Gosh, what was that teamwork?
- Let's go right away.

2436
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,300
We're on the same team!

2437
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,740
- I'll say 3, and he'll say 3.
- Right.

2438
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,540
- Okay. But you'll get five seconds.
- Okay.

2439
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:41,070
- I'll start, Jong Min.
- Go for it.

2440
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,980
- Geumtae, muktae, hwangtae.
- All right.

2441
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:45,480
Dongtae and dongtae.

2442
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:47,910
- One.
- Half-dried dongtae.

2443
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:50,350
(The dongtae lover)

2444
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:52,120
- Gosh!
- Geumtae is not allowed...

2445
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,150
as it was already mentioned.

2446
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:54,420
- Let's go for it.
- We don't need to talk about it.

2447
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:55,460
- We'll try saying them first.
- It's too easy.

2448
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:56,990
- Dongtae, saengtae,
- Dongtae, saengtae,

2449
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:58,830
- hwangtae, myungtae,
- hwangtae, myungtae,

2450
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:00,090
- muktae.
- muktae. We need one more.

2451
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,730
We just had dried pollack soup.

2452
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,260
- It's jjaktae.
- Jjaktae?

2453
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,730
- Jjaktae?
- That's wrong.

2454
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:06,730
(Will that be the right answer?)

2455
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:08,130
I think I've heard of that before.

2456
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,400
- Correct.
- Okay!

2457
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:12,110
- Gosh!
- Right?

2458
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:13,710
- I really made a guess.
- Jjaktae is right.

2459
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:15,380
There was a bar that had that name.

2460
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:16,680
I feel so happy.

2461
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,210
- Gosh, thank you, sir.
- Please let it be cold.

2462
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:19,350
- Please.
- It's cold.

2463
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:20,910
We don't get a bottle each?

2464
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:23,450
I'll give you 1kg. Can I have a sip?

2465
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:24,650
Bring 15kg.

2466
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:26,190
(Dumbfounded)

2467
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,320
For just a sip?

2468
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,520
I'm done.

2469
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,720
(You must have some Coke
after eating meat.)

2470
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:32,890
(Thrilled)

2471
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:36,000
(Quenching his thirst refreshingly)

2472
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,860
Gosh, that was a great round.

2473
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,230
- Coke is a must.
- But what is jjaktae?

2474
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:41,470
Jjaktae is the dried pollack...

2475
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:44,300
sprinkled with salt.

2476
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,510
This is for your information.

2477
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:48,140
Myungtae, saengtae, dongtae,
hwangtae, bukeo,

2478
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:50,880
nogari, kodari, muktae, and jjaktae.
These are the names.

2479
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,550
There are dozens of other names too.

2480
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:53,610
- There are more?
- Right.

2481
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:56,650
So kodari is another name
of the same fish.

2482
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:58,180
All right, everyone.

2483
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,250
We will go inside and check
the water parsley collected.

2484
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,420
We did collect a lot.

2485
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:03,260
They get collected
a lot quicker than I thought.

2486
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:04,460
- It's fun to do too.
- Right.

2487
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,090
How much do we get
for each kilogram?

2488
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:07,490
- You get 1,000 seeds.
- We get 1,000 seeds?

2489
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:08,500
(They get 1,000 seeds
for each kilogram.)

2490
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,960
We will weigh them quickly.

2491
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:13,100
The scent of the water parsley
and pork belly is great.

2492
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:16,100
This is 9kg. This much is 9kg.

2493
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,340
- This is 5.5kg.
- It's 8kg?

2494
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,440
That's 14.5kg?

2495
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:21,010
It's 14.5kg.
You will be given 14,500 seeds.

2496
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:22,380
Gosh, there's too much of it.

2497
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:25,310
- This much?
- Gosh, hold on.

2498
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:26,450
It's 11kg.

2499
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:28,150
- It's 11kg?
- This much is 11kg.

2500
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:30,250
(Picking up)

2501
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,820
These are the ones that we dropped.

2502
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:33,550
- Is it true that you put in dirt?
- No!

2503
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:35,120
This is 5.5kg.

2504
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,290
- What?
- It's 5.5kg.

2505
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:37,290
(Not believing him)

2506
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:39,260
- That's 2kg more than us.
- What?

2507
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,860
Why are you being like that to us?

2508
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:44,400
It's around 5.8kg to 5.9kg.

2509
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,730
- It will be 5.8kg.
- Right.

2510
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:47,500
How could 0.3kg get missed?

2511
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,900
- You got 16.8kg.
- That's not a big difference.

2512
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,340
That's not a big difference.
That's fine.

2513
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,570
- Here come the stars.
- Those thieves.

2514
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:54,040
No. They have a lot.

2515
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,540
This is 8.2kg.

2516
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,010
- It's 8.2kg?
- Right. It's 8.2kg.

2517
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:58,380
(Second batch, 12kg)

2518
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,650
- This is 12kg.
- This is 12kg.

2519
01:22:59,650 --> 01:23:01,550
- This won't be 10kg.
- It will be enough.

2520
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:02,550
(They have 3 batches
unlike the other teams.)

2521
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:04,620
It's around 8.5kg. It's 8.4kg.

2522
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,090
You got 28.6kg.

2523
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:08,460
- Gosh.
- They got 28.6kg. Gosh.

2524
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:11,220
What now then?
The benefit means nothing then.

2525
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:13,890
Team Se Yoon and Joon
gets 14,500 seeds.

2526
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:16,660
Team Jong Min and DinDin
gets 16,800 seeds.

2527
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:19,470
Team Sae Ho and Seon Ho
gets 28,600 seeds.

2528
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:21,600
(Team Jong Min and DinDin, 51,000,
Team Sae Ho and Seon Ho, 36,200,)

2529
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,470
(Team Se Yoon and Joon, 29,600)

2530
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:25,510
- It became meaningless.
- Right.

2531
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:26,870
- Right.
- Right.

2532
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:28,840
Getting off work late meant nothing.

2533
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,810
No. We worked really hard.

2534
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:33,480
Does collecting water parsley
mean much in a variety show?

2535
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,080
The Division Head
would be really happy, won't he?

2536
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:39,950
"You did well to collect
water parsley, you celebrities."

2537
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:41,420
You're supposed to mess things up...

2538
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:42,920
and make people laugh.

2539
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:45,630
- This is frustrating.
- He would love it.

2540
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:46,660
(Laughing)

2541
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,190
(They laugh it off
feeling embarrassed.)

2542
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,530
- You only picked water parsley.
- Hang on.

2543
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:52,630
Let's move on
to the next destination.

2544
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:54,530
- All right.
- Yes!

2545
01:23:55,400 --> 01:24:00,010
(The weather of spring
has already arrived.)

2546
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:05,650
(He can't help
but sing spring songs.)

2547
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:09,350
("The Virgin Bachelor"
by Kang Hong Sik)

2548
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:10,980
- Do you know this song?
- I do.

2549
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:13,020
I like
"When Flowering Spring Comes."

2550
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,120
Go ahead and sing it.

2551
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:18,890
("When Flowering Spring Comes"
by BMK)

2552
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:20,830
(Singing)

2553
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
(Singing)

2554
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,400
(Interrupting)

2555
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:30,140
(They're even singing in harmony.)

2556
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,810
It turns out the Kim of KimNaParkLee
is Kim Jong Min.

2557
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,040
(Kim Jong Min is 1 of the top 4 vocalists
of the country.)

2558
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:36,180
(Chuckling)

2559
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,210
I was very touched recently.

2560
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:39,610
When I got home after the shoot,

2561
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:41,780
I got a video from DinDin.

2562
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,450
I was like, "What is this?"
And I played the video.

2563
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,820
He was singing "Where Are You Now?"

2564
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:52,460
(The video DinDin sent to Sae Ho)

2565
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:55,460
He sent me the video of him
singing the song.

2566
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:56,900
"Congratulations
on ChoNam Zone's comeback."

2567
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:59,000
- It was really touching.
- Of course.

2568
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,630
DinDin and I
have been running together...

2569
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:01,870
- these days.
- Really?

2570
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,370
He gives me some running gear
whenever we meet.

2571
01:25:05,370 --> 01:25:06,770
He asked some singers...

2572
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:08,170
- to sing at my wedding.
- He takes care of everything.

2573
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,010
I know a lot of singers too.

2574
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,280
- But he took care of it.
- But when he's on 2 Days and 1 Night...

2575
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,010
- He becomes strange.
- Right.

2576
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,450
What is your true self?

2577
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,420
Actually, I'm confused...

2578
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:19,990
- about my identity too.
- I know. After doing all that...

2579
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:22,120
We film 2 Days and 1 Night
for a total of 4 days...

2580
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,360
- in a month.
- Right.

2581
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,360
And the DinDin
during these four days...

2582
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:27,690
is really strange.

2583
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:31,730
And the world only knows
this side of me.

2584
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:34,000
I find it really tough.

2585
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,440
Wherever I go, people are like...

2586
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,740
What kind of life am I leading now?

2587
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:39,470
- It's like...
- You should try...

2588
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:41,210
to show your true self here too.

2589
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:44,110
- Try playing games with a smile.
- Right.

2590
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:45,110
- Be sweet.
- Yes.

2591
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:47,010
- If I do that,
- Yes.

2592
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:49,580
I won't get enough airtime.
Do you want me to try it?

2593
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:51,950
- Can I do that until the next game?
- Yes. Go ahead.

2594
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:53,320
- Then...
- Isn't it allowed?

2595
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,720
someone will have to play...

2596
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,190
- DinDin's part.
- I'll do that.

2597
01:25:57,190 --> 01:25:58,320
We should let Joon do it.

2598
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,130
- Should I do it?
- Throw a tantrum.

2599
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:02,460
How do I look today?

2600
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,800
You're ugly.

2601
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:08,230
- Hey, that's a little...
- Is that what DinDin does?

2602
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:10,170
- I'm not that rude.
- I know.

2603
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,670
(He suddenly attacks Sae Ho
when he's supposed to get angry.)

2604
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,110
- It's not like that.
- You should tease him.

2605
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:14,870
- But you...
- Did I do it wrong?

2606
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,010
- You're doing well. Continue.
- Okay.

2607
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:20,280
You just can't do it
because you're kind-hearted.

2608
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,410
(DinDin should play DinDin's part.)

2609
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:25,620
(Passing along
the winding mountain paths,)

2610
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:30,290
(they arrive at the next destination
full of the scent of phytoncide.)

2611
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,930
The weather is perfect.

2612
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:33,190
(Jong Min and DinDin: 51,000 seeds)

2613
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:35,730
(Just looking at each other
makes them smile.)

2614
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:38,360
- Joon, here's what I think.
- Yes?

2615
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:41,030
Is it better to come in 1st place
or 2nd place...

2616
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:42,340
on 2 Days and 1 Night?

2617
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:44,270
- First place.
- That's not true.

2618
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:46,940
- Why?
- First place becomes the target.

2619
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,040
I see.

2620
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,580
I want to be the target
at least once.

2621
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,540
Are you serious?

2622
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,710
I've never been in first place.

2623
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,180
- What?
- I'll make it happen.

2624
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:59,950
- You should know how it feels too.
- Please do that.

2625
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:02,620
Okay. I'll be in battle mode
from now on.

2626
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:04,920
- Are you serious?
- All right.

2627
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,190
- Let's go.
- Let's win, seriously.

2628
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:09,400
- Things are going well now.
- It's not bad. It's good.

2629
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,730
- We're a good match.
- I know.

2630
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,930
You know I like you...

2631
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:15,230
- more than anyone.
- I do.

2632
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,200
- And I like you a lot, you know?
- Really?

2633
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,370
I know.

2634
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:20,640
Sometimes you make me sad,
but it's okay.

2635
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,610
- This place is so pretty.
- My gosh.

2636
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:25,350
(Trees are standing endlessly
as if they'd reach the sky.)

2637
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,680
- This is amazing.
- Awesome.

2638
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:30,750
The trees are as high as 30m.

2639
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,590
(Jealous)

2640
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:34,050
We have to take a picture of this.

2641
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:35,220
(The spectacle created by nature
makes them exclaim in awe.)

2642
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,720
- We should take a picture here.
- Hey.

2643
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:38,690
- We have to take a picture here.
- Seriously.

2644
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:40,990
- Let's do that.
- One at a time. Go.

2645
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:43,100
Jong Min takes good pictures.
He should do that.

2646
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,470
- I'm good at it. I'll do it.
- Go ahead. One at a time.

2647
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,900
Look over here. One, two, three.

2648
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:49,670
One, two, three.

2649
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:51,500
Jong Min should take one.

2650
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,210
All right. Look back.

2651
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:57,210
- Gosh, the trees are...
- They are really tall.

2652
01:27:57,210 --> 01:27:59,280
- There's a squirrel.
- It's a squirrel.

2653
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,680
- Where?
- Where is it?

2654
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,250
- Over here.
- Where?

2655
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:04,450
- There's a squirrel.
- My goodness.

2656
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,420
- Amazing.
- There are three.

2657
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:10,460
It's a dam.

2658
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:11,990
(Passing through
the cypress forest path,)

2659
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:16,100
(they go up the wooden stairs.)

2660
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,230
My goodness. What is this?

2661
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:19,730
This is a dam.

2662
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:20,730
(Another scenery unfolds
before their eyes.)

2663
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,540
(The dam is filled
with refreshing, wide blue water.)

2664
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,410
- My gosh.
- This is amazing.

2665
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:31,540
The trees are beautiful.

2666
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:34,210
- It's so pretty.
- Korea has many pretty places.

2667
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:35,850
Right. Korea is the best.

2668
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:37,920
(They stop for a moment
and enjoy the scenery.)

2669
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:40,720
The scenery is beautiful, isn't it?

2670
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,060
- Yes.
- It's amazing. Trees are pretty.

2671
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:45,490
- It's beautiful.
- The trees...

2672
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:47,130
This is Beopgi Reservoir,

2673
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:50,630
a place that boasts
magnificent views of lush forests...

2674
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,330
and tall pine trees on the bank.

2675
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:53,830
- Beopgi Reservoir.
- Yes.

2676
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:57,000
It is said to be
a beautiful travel destination in Yangsan,

2677
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,400
where you can see cherry blossoms...

2678
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,510
- in spring.
- It must be beautiful.

2679
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:01,210
- Really? Are they cherry trees?
- Yes.

2680
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:03,980
We will give you the opportunity
to get your seed money...

2681
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:05,780
- at this place.
- Okay.

2682
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:08,250
- There must be something big.
- Please bring it in.

2683
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,250
- What?
- My gosh.

2684
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:10,520
All right!

2685
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,550
Let's make big money. Seed money.

2686
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:13,720
Are they tumblers?

2687
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,420
- Let's go.
- What is this?

2688
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:18,990
As you can see, there are six cups.

2689
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:22,560
Three of them are filled with water,
and the other three are empty.

2690
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,560
(3 are filled with water,
and the other 3 are empty.)

2691
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:25,700
You can participate by paying...

2692
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,400
- as many seeds as you want.
- Okay.

2693
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:30,000
You will choose one cup each.

2694
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,770
If both of you choose empty cups,
you will succeed...

2695
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:34,770
and receive
double the participation fee.

2696
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:36,940
If one of you chooses
a cup filled with water,

2697
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:39,180
you will fail and lose
the participation fee you paid.

2698
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,910
You should take a risk.

2699
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:42,320
I'll give it a try.

2700
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,250
I'm lucky.

2701
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:46,190
Which team will go first?

2702
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:48,150
Raise your hand
if you want Team Sae Ho to go first.

2703
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:50,120
- Why?
- One, two, three.

2704
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:51,420
- But why...
- Team Sae Ho.

2705
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:53,790
- Come on. What are you doing?
- Team Sae Ho goes first.

2706
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,130
Raise your hand if you want
Team Se Yoon to go first.

2707
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:56,430
One, two, three.

2708
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:58,630
- Come on.
- Team Sae Ho. In 1, 2, 3.

2709
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,900
- Let's give them an applause.
- Yes!

2710
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,200
All right. Let's do that.

2711
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,100
- Just do it. It's okay.
- Let's do that.

2712
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:05,510
- Go.
- All right.

2713
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:08,040
- It will be all the same.
- How much would you pay?

2714
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:09,610
- How much do we have?
- How much would you pay?

2715
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:10,840
- How much do we have?
- We have 36,200 seeds.

2716
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,780
The thing is,

2717
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:14,680
it wouldn't be so bad
to take a risk.

2718
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,580
Even if we lose.

2719
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:18,420
How much do you want to pay?

2720
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:20,420
What about 2,500?

2721
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:22,860
Seriously? You said
you wanted to take a risk,

2722
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:24,620
so I was thinking of 10,000 seeds.

2723
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,830
Then, let's take it easy for now.

2724
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:28,290
We're the first one to go.
Let's just do it.

2725
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:29,600
Okay. Let's do that.

2726
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,800
We'll pay 2,500 seeds.

2727
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,930
- Did you say 2,500?
- Yes.

2728
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:33,470
- Only 2,500 seeds?
- What?

2729
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:34,830
Come on! That's really...

2730
01:30:34,830 --> 01:30:37,200
- That's absurd.
- You are Cho Chicken.

2731
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,970
- Cho Chicken?
- What's Cho Chicken?

2732
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:40,410
- He's a coward.
- What?

2733
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:42,310
- Cho Chicken.
- I'm Cho Chicken?

2734
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:44,210
- He's Cho Chicken.
- We're doing it our way.

2735
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:45,650
- Why are you meddling?
- Right.

2736
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:46,980
- Pick one each?
- Yes.

2737
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:48,180
(It's time to pick a cup.)

2738
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:50,550
All right. Once you pick one,
I'll open it.

2739
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:51,720
Wait, Sae Ho.

2740
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,720
(The 6 cups that can't be
distinguished with the naked eye)

2741
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,990
(The probability of 2 people
choosing empty cups is 20 percent.)

2742
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:00,890
Sae Ho, looking at it doesn't work.
You should just choose one.

2743
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:02,130
Just say a number
without touching it.

2744
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:03,200
You'd feel it. Don't touch it.

2745
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,260
(It's number 2!)

2746
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:05,460
Number two?

2747
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,470
(Jong Min thinks number 2 is empty.)

2748
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:08,330
- Let's just do it.
- Okay.

2749
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:09,370
I pick number five.

2750
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:12,070
Number 5. Cho Sae Ho chose number 5.

2751
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:13,840
Cho Sae Ho chose number five?

2752
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,210
(Thinking)

2753
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:17,180
- I'll pick number 4 then.
- Okay. Numbers 4 and 5.

2754
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,440
- Numbers 4 and 5.
- Congratulations.

2755
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,980
(Seon Ho chooses number 4.)

2756
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:21,010
Numbers 4 and 5.

2757
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:22,750
Pick it up gently.

2758
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:23,920
(Se Yoon and Joon
will check the results.)

2759
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:26,950
(Lee Joon checks the cup
picked by Seon Ho.)

2760
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:30,060
(It's hard to read Joon's face.)

2761
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:34,090
(Se Yoon checks Sae Ho's cup.)

2762
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,800
(Smiling)

2763
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,630
(Team Sae Ho and Seon Ho is
about to check the results.)

2764
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:41,570
Are they going to be okay
without a towel?

2765
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:42,570
Will they cover it?

2766
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:43,640
Are they going to be okay
without a towel?

2767
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:44,670
Will they cover it?

2768
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:46,470
- I can't do that. You should.
- I will.

2769
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:47,610
(Is it a cup filled with water?)

2770
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:49,640
- I'll cover the microphone. Go.
- Okay.

2771
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,040
You have no chance
to change your choice.

2772
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,650
- Just do it right away.
- Okay. Ready.

2773
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:54,080
All right. Let's do this.

2774
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,110
- Go.
- Here I go.

2775
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:56,450
You should count to three.

2776
01:31:56,450 --> 01:31:58,380
(The probability of success
is only 20 percent.)

2777
01:31:58,520 --> 01:31:59,590
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2778
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:02,120
(Will they keep the seed money?)

2779
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:05,290
(Or will they lose it?)

2780
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:09,160
(Next episode)

2781
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:11,430
(We are...)

2782
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:13,570
(still thirsty.)

2783
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:16,200
(The thirst for seed money...)

2784
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,770
(is getting stronger over time.)

2785
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:20,810
(They must get...)

2786
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:22,880
(more seed money no matter what.)

2787
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,440
(Boldly!)

2788
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:25,980
- All in.
- We will go all in.

2789
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,150
(Dopamine rush)

2790
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:32,150
(Pleasure without responsibility)

2791
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:35,990
(Pleasure always
comes with responsibility.)

2792
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,420
(I went through a lot
to save up this money.)

2793
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:40,390
(Can I bet my phone?)

2794
01:32:40,730 --> 01:32:42,530
(It drives them crazy.)

2795
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,400
(What is the identity
of the seed money?)

2796
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:47,170
Just give me some!
