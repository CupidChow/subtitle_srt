1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,040
I'm glad we found each other.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,740
- We did well.
- We did.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,480
How do we all sleep indoors?

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,410
How long has it been
since we all slept together?

5
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,980
The lodging. Why is it so nice?

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,820
- What's this?
- This is insane.

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,220
- It's madness.
- It's so nice.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,220
We're sleeping in a nice place.

9
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,220
(Pretty vines welcome them
to the lodging.)

10
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,860
- Hey, meringue...
- Isn't this the meringue place?

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,060
Isn't this the meringue place?

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,630
Yes, we were here before.

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,430
- Jong Min was...
- We were here before.

14
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,630
I remember this place.

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,900
(3 years ago, a meringue mission
decided where they would sleep.)

16
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,900
Go on.

17
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,240
(Jong Min suddenly attacked,)

18
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,350
(but he suffered greatly
when DinDin got back at him.)

19
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,480
(This place holds
scary memories of meringue.)

20
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,420
This place is amazing.

21
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,050
Let's go. It's nice here.

22
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,120
I'll show you around.

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,820
- This place is awesome.
- We came here often.

24
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,460
- Show me around.
- Okay. Come along.

25
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,290
We're sleeping in a nice place.

26
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,960
- This is an incredible place.
- It's insane.

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,000
(They love their base camp,
and they're feeling great.)

28
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,830
We can drink this.

29
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,130
- For real?
- We can drink this.

30
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,270
- We can?
- It's to welcome us.

31
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,600
- Can we really drink it?
- I don't know.

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,740
(Smiling)

33
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,110
- We can't drink it.
- They're here.

34
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,340
We came back.

35
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,910
- It's so...
- There's a room with beds.

36
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,140
Can we eat something?

37
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,910
This place is insane.

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,350
Jong Min's
going to drink the coffee.

39
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,150
There's a room with beds.

40
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,420
My gosh, this is...

41
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,990
- It was nice here.
- There's a bidet too.

42
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,190
- Of course.
- Of course.

43
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,760
(Eating)

44
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,560
- What are you eating so much of?
- What?

45
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
- What are you eating?
- What?

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,600
What are you eating?

47
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,730
- What are you eating?
- What's that?

48
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,830
- What...
- What are you doing?

49
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,900
- What's this?
- In the open?

50
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,370
- What's this?
- It won't kill you. It's a coin.

51
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,100
(Jong Min had been
secretly eating...)

52
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,540
(the gold coin chocolate.)

53
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,440
(Glancing)

54
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,210
- You're so thick-faced.
- What the heck?

55
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,310
(What is with him?)

56
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,880
- I thought the coin...
- The gold coin...

57
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,150
- How many are there?
- You're unbelievable.

58
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,320
My gosh.

59
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,480
- How many did you eat?
- What are you doing?

60
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Two?

61
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,720
If you had this many,

62
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,290
you should've asked
if we wanted any.

63
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,620
- He just...
- You kept eating.

64
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,360
He sat here and ate
as if it were no big deal.

65
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,090
We still have a lot.

66
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,360
- Director Joo is entering.
- What's going on?

67
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,000
- Aren't you hungry?
- Yes.

68
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,170
- Let's get going then.
- Okay.

69
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,200
- Great.
- Okay.

70
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,530
- Okay.
- Let's go and eat.

71
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,070
Let's go and eat, guys.

72
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,210
(As the cloudy sky clears up,
the moon shines brightly today.)

73
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,710
We're lucky that it stopped raining.

74
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,280
- Right. My gosh, it's so humid.
- Yes.

75
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,350
Where are we going to eat?

76
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,180
(Director Joo, give us our food.)

77
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,980
You must be getting hungry now.

78
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,380
- I'm hungry.
- I'm starving.

79
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,820
- It's getting pretty late.
- "Now?"

80
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,450
- It's 10 p.m. now.
- "Now?"

81
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,060
- It's past 10 p.m. now.
- It's 10 p.m. now.

82
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,990
You've been on an adventure today.

83
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,990
- Is it still ongoing?
- Yes.

84
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,030
Actually,

85
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,560
the biggest firefly habitat is
on a nearby mountain, Mount Unmun.

86
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,130
And it's the first place where
fireflies are spotted in Korea.

87
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,370
- I want to see some fireflies.
- Fireflies are beautiful.

88
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,270
This natural greenhouse is called
Cheongsuri Gotjawal.

89
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,610
- Cheongsuri Gotjawal.
- We prepared to go there today.

90
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,080
- But we got here late today.
- We can't see the fireflies then?

91
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,710
- So...
- And it's raining too.

92
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,550
Fireflies are spotted
only in clean areas.

93
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,620
- Really?
- I see.

94
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,780
- They're spotted only for a month.
- Right. In June.

95
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,120
- They're spotted from June to July.
- But we won't get to see them?

96
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,250
(They're much more beautiful
in person.)

97
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,760
(The fireflies shine brightly
as they greet summer.)

98
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,000
(They radiate brightly and disappear
like the stars in the night sky.)

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,730
- Gosh, that's amazing.
- What?

100
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,770
That's what we prepared.

101
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,240
- Let's check it out next year.
- We ought to do that.

102
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,470
Let's do that then.

103
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,740
- All right then.
- What about our dinner?

104
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,880
You must embark on a journey
for your dinner.

105
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,910
- A journey?
- By the way,

106
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,880
- Yes?
- when will today's journey end?

107
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,320
I'm so hungry that
my stomach is hurting.

108
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,850
- You must be quite hungry.
- Yes.

109
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,520
Today's dinner is
about the pride of Jeju.

110
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,850
Is it black pork?

111
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,390
It's a black pork meal
with an assortment of special cuts.

112
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,890
- Let's get this.
- We ought to eat this.

113
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,990
- It's not Jeju without black pork.
- This is great.

114
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,900
(The staff picked up
special cuts of black pork...)

115
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,900
(from a famous local restaurant.)

116
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,870
(Pork neck, thin skirt, gabrisal,
pork jowl, collar butt, pork temple)

117
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,470
You can't see it from here.

118
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,700
But there's a mountain
called Mount Sanbang.

119
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,940
- Yes, I know that mountain.
- It's a famous mountain.

120
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,940
- Mount Sanbang.
- Mount Sanbang.

121
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,940
Legend has it that
the Great Jade Emperor tore...

122
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,480
the peak of Mount Halla
and threw it.

123
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,810
And that became Mount Sanbang.

124
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,580
So this mystical mountain comes
with a legend of its own.

125
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,880
- He threw it?
- Yes.

126
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,550
We prepared the Dinner Game
with the mystical energy...

127
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,350
of Mount Sanbang.

128
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,190
It's Jeju Makeover Challenge.

129
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,520
- "Jeju Makeover Challenge?"
- Yes.

130
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,030
Just like the title,
you must undergo a makeover...

131
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,090
for this mission.

132
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,000
It will be a 3-on-3 team match.

133
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,760
It will be a best-of-three match.

134
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,630
Then only 3 of us can eat.
And the other 3 can't eat.

135
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,070
This is the worst.

136
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,870
We can't let them have black pork.

137
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,810
(Whom should I team up with?)

138
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,340
Who had hairtails earlier?

139
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,740
What? Did all of you eat them?

140
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,480
Is that
how you want to divide up the teams?

141
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,910
- You want your revenge? Is that it?
- Yes, it's a revenge match.

142
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,980
- If we do that, it's likely...
- We can...

143
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,280
- that we might lose.
- Joon can't eat then.

144
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,820
- Do you not want me on your team?
- Yes.

145
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,150
- You're looking down on me.
- No.

146
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,790
- He's totally looking down on you.
- I'm good at makeovers.

147
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,990
- No. That's not the problem.
- Come on. Believe in him.

148
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,720
But everyone is trying to avoid
teaming up with you.

149
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,760
- No.
- Why are you avoiding me?

150
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,860
- Are you trying to avoid me?
- That's not it.

151
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,960
- You should ask Sae Ho too.
- Hey.

152
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,660
- His opinion is important too.
- What do you think, Sae Ho?

153
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,530
Won't it be fun
if we mix up the teams?

154
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
- Right. Well...
- The thing is...

155
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,440
- How did I end up as the weakest?
- No.

156
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,710
- Okay. Are you really confident?
- I'm really confident.

157
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,310
- Okay. I'll team up with you.
- No. You can't believe that.

158
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,480
This is how we lost earlier.

159
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
- My hands are tied.
- Hey, join them.

160
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,910
- He and I were the new recruits.
- Who knows?

161
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,210
- Hey, you have no confidence in me?
- Join them.

162
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,710
- But I'm really hungry.
- Is that all you amount to?

163
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,480
- Hey, I'll get you dinner.
- You can win dinner then.

164
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,850
- Why...
- I'm sure he'll carry your team.

165
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,990
- Why are you so scared?
- Promise me one thing.

166
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,150
What promise?

167
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,320
- Let's do our best.
- Right.

168
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,760
I've always done my best.

169
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,390
It's not about doing our best.
Let's do well.

170
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,290
- We'll have a feast. Let's do this.
- Promise me one thing.

171
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,290
(Satisfied)

172
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,700
Hey,
check out the color of my shirt.

173
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,560
- Black.
- It means I'm getting black pork.

174
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,100
- You're a black pig today.
- Right.

175
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,130
- You're dressed like a black pig.
- You're dressed in black.

176
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,640
(His outfit is time, place,
and occasion appropriate.)

177
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,970
Why do you think
I'm wearing a black shirt?

178
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,670
- Really?
- It's for black pork.

179
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,380
He suddenly changed his outfit
and dressed like a black pig.

180
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,740
- A black shirt for Jeju.
- You bet.

181
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,450
We have the game in the bag.

182
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,910
- Here's the name of our team.
- Yes?

183
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,450
- We are...
- What is this?

184
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,480
- Team Along with Joon.
- Team Along with Joon.

185
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,550
We're Team Along with Joon.

186
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,850
- I see. That's great.
- Believe in me.

187
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,520
- Team Along with Joon.
- I'll get you dinner.

188
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,120
We don't need to come up
with names like that.

189
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,290
- We're Team Original.
- Okay.

190
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,190
- Team Pure-Blooded.
- Team Pure-Blooded?

191
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,900
- Team Pure-Blooded?
- Yes. We're Team Pure-Blooded.

192
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,430
If you're ready,

193
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,330
let's start the first round.

194
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,300
(Darn it.
I think we're going to lose.)

195
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,400
Hey, don't be scared.

196
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,900
- I know what we're doing.
- Come on.

197
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,410
- We have to put on the outfit.
- Gosh.

198
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,540
Okay.

199
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,010
Gosh, Team Along with Joon.

200
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,810
For the first round
of the Jeju Makeover Challenge,

201
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,250
you must transform into...

202
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,380
- a haenyeo.
- Transform into a haenyeo.

203
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,150
The team that finishes putting on
the haenyeo diver suits first...

204
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,290
- in the relay will win the round.
- This?

205
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,990
Only those
who finish putting on the suit...

206
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,720
- can help the next person.
- Okay.

207
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,760
Everyone on the team must put on
the haenyeo diver suits.

208
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,830
Then the team
that rings the bell first will win.

209
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,660
Then we have to take off our pants.

210
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,570
I think you can wear the suit
on top of your clothes.

211
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,670
- Take it easy.
- But my pants are wide.

212
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,400
- I have a disadvantage.
- Right. Yours are too wide.

213
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,570
- Hey. I should take them off.
- Come on.

214
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,840
- You'll take them off again?
- If...

215
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,710
If we take off our clothes,
can you blur us?

216
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,910
I want to stop taking off
my clothes on the show. Please.

217
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,180
We can blur you out.

218
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,620
I took off my clothes too many times
on the show. I hate it too.

219
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,020
- You did take them off quite often.
- I hate it too.

220
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,590
You're taking off your clothes
once every month.

221
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,650
- Do you want to go and change?
- All together. Okay.

222
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,650
- Can I?
- Yes.

223
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,960
- You'll change your pants?
- No.

224
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,620
- You can't do that.
- We don't have time.

225
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,730
This is why
no one wanted to team up with you.

226
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,490
Hey. Watch me.

227
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,660
- I'll take off my pants.
- Sure.

228
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,400
- Take them off. We can, right?
- Hey.

229
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,530
- Whatever.
- He's always stripping on our show.

230
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,000
- No.
- This should be the order.

231
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This should be the order.

232
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,640
- I'm going to need help.
- No. He must go second.

233
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,940
I'll be honest. I've done
this game before on the show.

234
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,240
But I wasn't good at it.
I shouldn't go first.

235
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
- This guy...
- Then...

236
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,640
- I should go 2nd.
- I'll go 1st.

237
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,580
- I'm good at this.
- Yes, I think you'll be good at it.

238
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,750
- Great. We're ready.
- Let's go for it.

239
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,020
- We're ready.
- Let's go. Let's do this.

240
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,480
- Did you decide on the order?
- Jong Hyun.

241
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,290
Make sure to blur out my body.

242
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,290
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

243
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,760
Writers, don't be so shocked.

244
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,820
(Warning them in advance)

245
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,860
Let's begin.

246
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,190
Get ready.
(1st, 2nd, and 3rd)

247
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,460
Sae Ho. Zip up your pants.
And then we'll begin.

248
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,800
- Hey. Come on.
- My gosh.

249
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,970
- Come on.
- Hey!

250
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,970
I'm sorry.

251
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,800
- Our show is classy.
- I...

252
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,100
Let me formally apologize.

253
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,000
How dare you expose your underwear?

254
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,040
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

255
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,640
You can't play it like that.

256
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,480
- Get ready.
- What's up with the socks?

257
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Set.

258
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,080
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

259
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,550
Let's go.

260
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,380
- He's exposing his underwear.
- Come on.

261
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,620
- What is this? Come on.
- What is this?

262
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,650
This is just disgusting.

263
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,390
- Let's do this.
- You're fast.

264
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,920
- My gosh.
- You're fast.

265
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,530
- Show them.
- Calm down.

266
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,060
(Jong Min quickly puts in
one of his legs.)

267
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,630
- You're fast.
- Show them.

268
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,270
- Calm down.
- Take your time.

269
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,900
- Okay. Don't worry.
- Show them.

270
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,400
- You're fast.
- This is so tight.

271
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
- We're faster.
- This is it.

272
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,540
- We're ahead.
- We're winning.

273
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,770
- We're ahead.
- We're ahead.

274
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,770
- We're ahead.
- Hey.

275
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,870
- There you go!
- Yes, that's it.

276
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,080
- Square your shoulders.
- That's it.

277
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
- Square your shoulders.
- My gosh.

278
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,280
- You won.
- You got this.

279
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,210
- There you go.
- My gosh.

280
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,250
- It has to cover up more.
- Let it cover up.

281
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,820
- It must cover up more.
- That's it.

282
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,080
It must cover up more.

283
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,450
- Okay.
- Okay.

284
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,650
- Okay.
- Hey, go.

285
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,390
- Right here. Put it on.
- You got this, Jong Min.

286
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,590
(A fully dressed member
can help other members.)

287
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,690
No.

288
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,060
You got this, Jong Min.

289
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,530
(They're frustrated
as they can't help him.)

290
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,800
(He just needs to zip it up.)

291
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,030
Hurry up. Come on.

292
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,270
- You got it.
- That's it.

293
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,300
- Okay.
- Put it on.

294
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,340
He must put on the cap.

295
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,400
- Hurry up.
- Put it on.

296
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,770
- Okay.
- Help him.

297
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,210
(They must pick up the speed,
but Se Yoon is up next.)

298
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,240
(He puts on the cap first
as it's easy to put on.)

299
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,010
Stop laughing. Don't laugh.

300
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,980
- Put it in.
- Put it in.

301
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Go ahead.

302
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,490
(Se Yoon is doing better
than anticipated.)

303
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,820
(He's not helping.
He just has his hand on Se Yoon.)

304
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,290
(Seon Ho will be done
once he puts on the cap?)

305
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,890
- Seon Ho.
- Get your arms.

306
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,760
No, Seon Ho isn't done. Wait.

307
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,460
- His zipper is open. Stop, Joon.
- Seon Ho isn't ready.

308
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,130
- Seon Ho.
- The zipper...

309
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,000
The zipper is broken.

310
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,270
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Okay.

311
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,500
(Meanwhile, Se Yoon finishes
putting on the suit super quickly.)

312
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,900
- I'm done.
- Go.

313
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,070
The last members are up!
(They start putting on the suit
at the same time.)

314
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,310
Here.

315
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,340
- Put in your legs.
- They're neck-and-neck.

316
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,750
Put it on.

317
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,950
(I had to take off my clothes again.
I can't lose now.)

318
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,280
- Your arms.
- Put in your arms.

319
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,380
- Just put in your arms.
- I got it.

320
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,950
- One, two.
- One, two.

321
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,050
- Okay.
- Right away...

322
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,690
(Popping into the suit)

323
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,860
(He perfectly puts on the suit
without any difficulty.)

324
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,890
- Go.
- My gosh.

325
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,130
(They try to catch up
instead of giving up.)

326
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,400
(The game is already over.)

327
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,900
- Ring the bell. Okay.
- The bell!

328
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,570
(Team Pure-Blooded wins.)

329
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,240
- Team Pure-Blooded!
- Team Pure-Blooded!

330
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,710
(This is the know-how
of the original members.)

331
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,340
We couldn't get past this.

332
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,640
(Feeling dejected)

333
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,510
(Why did we even bother
taking off our clothes?)

334
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,980
- Hey, he put it on in one go.
- We had a great strategy.

335
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
(Good job on your wasted effort.)

336
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,050
Let's continue
with the second round.

337
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,790
The second round
of the Jeju Makeover Challenge is...

338
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,290
Transform into Dol Hareubang.

339
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,360
- What?
- All right.

340
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,930
Bring it in now.

341
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,230
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

342
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,300
Let's begin.

343
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,260
For this round, you must put on
the cap like Se Yoon.

344
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,300
- Your hair can't...
- It can't stick out?

345
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,600
- Right. Cover up your hair.
- Like this?

346
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,540
Wait. Aren't you Pong Pong Man?

347
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,070
(Dancing his signature move
right away)

348
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,810
- Show us your act.
- I haven't seen that in a while.

349
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,880
But I'm shy.

350
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,310
- It's fine.
- I'm good.

351
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,410
Everyone.
Here's the guest of today's episode.

352
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,550
- Help me, Pong Pong Man!
- Go.

353
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,480
(Back in the day, he was the fatty,
beloved by everyone.)

354
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,760
(His movements are sharp
despite his big build.)

355
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,290
(This dance was a sensation
in 2007.)

356
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,730
(The original performer shows us
the 2025 version of the dance.)

357
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
(His facial expression
has become more authentic.)

358
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,100
(Fascinated)

359
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,940
Let's win!

360
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,640
I haven't seen that in a while.

361
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,240
- It's been so long.
- It's been a while since I saw it.

362
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,740
- It's been a while, hasn't it?
- Everyone.

363
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,950
This time, you'll transform...

364
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,950
into dol hareubang,
the local symbol.

365
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,780
Your goal is to apply
the black cream on your face.

366
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,650
To win,
you must beat the other team...

367
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,790
at painting your faces black
like dol hareubang.

368
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,960
- All three of us must do it?
- Yes.

369
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,030
All of your faces
must be painted black.

370
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,530
Then wear the hats
on top of the judgment table.

371
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,030
You know the dol hareubang pose,
right?

372
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,030
- What pose?
- What is it?

373
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,930
This is the pose.
Your right hand is higher.

374
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,000
The right hand goes higher.

375
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,940
This is the perfect example.
All of your skin must be covered.

376
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,210
Once you do that pose...

377
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,640
With that pose, your team will win.

378
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,680
Hold on.

379
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,110
- We can wash it off, right?
- Of course.

380
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,910
My face won't look black
on my way to Seoul tomorrow, right?

381
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,810
- All right.
- Try to push up the cap.

382
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,220
But you can't touch your own face.

383
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,950
Teammates must apply it
on each other's faces.

384
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,190
I'll start in this pose.

385
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,250
(Let's begin in this pose too.)

386
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,660
- Team Pure-Blooded.
- All right.

387
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,320
(They're ready.)

388
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,530
Get ready.

389
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,830
Set.

390
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,900
(Transform into Dol Hareubang
starts!)

391
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,430
(Team Pure-Blooded's strategy is...)

392
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,670
(to paint two of their faces
simultaneously.)

393
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,230
Close your eyes.

394
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,400
(Se Yoon with big hands applies
the cream with delicate touches.)

395
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,100
(Their strategy is that 2 members
will work on 1 member together.)

396
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,000
- This is good.
- That's good.

397
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,010
Great.

398
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,180
- Okay. Good. Don't open your eyes.
- Don't open your eyes.

399
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,140
- That's good. Come here, Joon.
- Good.

400
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,150
(He kind of looks funny.)

401
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,680
I need to apply a bit more.

402
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,980
- Close your eyes.
- It's working.

403
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,690
(His touches on Joon
are even more aggressive.)

404
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,890
We can't miss a spot.

405
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,990
- We must cover everything.
- Joon's cheeks.

406
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,020
- We got it.
- Good.

407
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,390
(They're done with another one?)

408
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,930
- I'll close my eyes.
- Okay.

409
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,630
(Forget about being gentle.
They start applying it haphazardly.)

410
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,700
- I think we're good.
- We're good.

411
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,000
- We got it. Let me see.
- Let's see.

412
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,600
(We're good.)

413
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,010
(What do they need right now?)

414
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,710
(Speed!)

415
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,050
(Which team had the perfect makeover
to become dol hareubang?)

416
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,050
The right hand and then the left.

417
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,520
(We rang the bell first.)

418
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,060
My gosh. This is crazy.

419
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,790
(What's the result?)

420
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,130
(The perfect transformation
into dol hareubang)

421
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,230
Oh, my.

422
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,470
(Why won't you tell us the result?)

423
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,500
This round...

424
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,170
Guys, this round...

425
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,240
- Guys.
- Check the details.

426
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,570
Look at the middle
of DinDin's forehead.

427
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,440
(What about the middle
of his forehead?)

428
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
What is it?

429
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,540
- Look.
- Jong Min.

430
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,210
Let me see. They missed these spots.

431
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,450
- Really?
- These spots aren't covered.

432
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,850
- But our faces are fully covered.
- You can't fix it now.

433
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,150
Do you know what they remind me of?

434
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,560
They look like the white eyebrows...

435
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,860
- on those cute Shibas.
- What is this?

436
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,690
- What is this?
- I don't know what happened.

437
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,590
- I don't know how I look now.
- How did we miss those spots?

438
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,330
- What about you guys?
- We're fully covered.

439
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,630
(Then did you
fully paint your faces?)

440
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,000
- We're perfect.
- Yes.

441
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,670
We didn't miss any spots.

442
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,000
- All right.
- They did it perfectly, indeed.

443
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,310
Joon. You...

444
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,010
(Me?)

445
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,710
Hey, did you use a special product
or something?

446
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,480
Hold on. I saw him in New York!

447
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,350
I saw him in New York.

448
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,450
(Is that the kind of robot
spotted on the streets of New York?)

449
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,150
(A New Yorker shows up in Jeju.)

450
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,550
- I saw you in New York.
- Seriously.

451
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,850
- That's perfect.
- My gosh.

452
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,420
(Amazed)

453
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,490
- You get the vibe, right?
- This is amazing.

454
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,360
The second round
of Jeju Makeover Challenge...

455
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,430
- goes to Team Along with Joon.
- Okay.

456
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,230
We're not going to eat,
looking like this, right?

457
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,600
(Seon Ho's camera)

458
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,540
- That would be too mean.
- Do we have to eat in this state?

459
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,600
That would be too mean.

460
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,540
(You'll find out
once you get there.)

461
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,610
- Let's take a group picture.
- Yes.

462
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,180
- Yes. Let's take one.
- Take a picture of us.

463
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,050
- In this pose?
- Yes.

464
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,710
- We won't get a chance like this.
- Like statues.

465
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,380
- You should...
- Okay.

466
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,220
- We're dol hareubang.
- Look over there.

467
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,590
One, two, three.

468
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,520
(We're dol hareubang.)

469
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,360
- But this is funny, indeed.
- Yes.

470
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,860
Guys, we'll proceed
with the third round right away.

471
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,860
Great.

472
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,500
- We'll play in this condition?
- Yes.

473
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,600
The third round
of Jeju Makeover Challenge is...

474
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,940
Transform Back into Celebrities.

475
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,140
- Come on.
- Come on.

476
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,940
(Growling)

477
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,410
- Come on. Seriously?
- Come on.

478
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,540
- Why are you torturing us?
- This... My gosh.

479
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,280
- Why are you doing this to us?
- Come on.

480
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,650
- How...
- Is this fun for you?

481
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,120
Does it give you a thrill?

482
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,790
He was so happy when we were
playing the second round.

483
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,620
How can we transform back?

484
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,420
- All right. Set it up, please.
- We have to remove this.

485
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,990
I know this.
It's that humiliating game again.

486
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,370
(That day, his face was
painted black just like today.)

487
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,730
(It was a humiliating memory...)

488
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,440
(as he could only wash his face
with water from Se Yoon's back.)

489
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,670
(Joon's camera)

490
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,980
Guys, you need to come back
to your original condition, right?

491
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,810
Just like in the second round,

492
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,850
you can't touch your own face.

493
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,910
- What?
- What?

494
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,920
- The team that removes...
- You must tell me.

495
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,620
- more of the black cream will win.
- Okay.

496
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,350
Let me start without my hat.

497
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,960
(They remove the cap.)

498
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,660
(Laughing)

499
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,000
- You know what...
- He took it off nicely.

500
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
- It looks like Joon has a mask on.
- he looks like?

501
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,370
He looks like an actor in a movie
or something.

502
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,570
(I look like an actor?)

503
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,970
- You know?
- All right. Guys.

504
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,870
(I, Lee Joon,
will show you my superb acting.)

505
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,170
- Did you understand the rules?
- Yes.

506
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,770
This time, you can...

507
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,510
(It's shocking
how no one pays any attention.)

508
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,810
Two of you can only work
on one member.

509
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,850
- Okay.
- Hey.

510
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,150
- Here's what we'll do.
- You'll start with your hands...

511
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,520
- at your sides.
- My hands won't reach.

512
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,320
- You know what I mean, right?
- Okay. You...

513
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,020
- Can you squeeze that?
- Okay.

514
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,760
Let's say you're washing my face.
But when I'm almost done,

515
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,330
- we must switch first.
- Okay.

516
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,030
Here's what you'll do.
The moment we begin,

517
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,560
- Splash my face with it.
- dip your face in the bucket.

518
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,300
- Should I dip it in the water?
- Yes, do that.

519
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,270
Let's begin. Get ready. Set.

520
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,570
Dip your face in.

521
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,200
(Both of them dip their faces
in the water first.)

522
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,270
Okay.

523
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,380
(Team Pure-Blooded's strategy is
to wash his face in the water.)

524
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,380
Come out for a second. Breathe.

525
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,150
Gosh, it's not coming off.

526
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,850
- You need to use something for it.
- Get the foaming cleanser.

527
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,920
Wait.

528
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,050
- Hold on.
- Wait.

529
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,690
(He rubs soap on Jong Min's face.)

530
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,660
This is what we have to do.
This is the best method.

531
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,160
- It won't come off.
- It won't come off.

532
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,790
But we tried it out.

533
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,460
(Team Along with Joon is struggling
with the same problem.)

534
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,130
(Not much has changed
with Seon Ho's face.)

535
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,300
Is it not working?

536
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,040
Then try it on me. Work on me.

537
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,800
You have to wash off
the soap first. Wait.

538
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,710
(You have to wash off
the soap first.)

539
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,810
Hold on. You can't touch your face.

540
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,940
- I can't see. Wait.
- Give that to me.

541
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,480
Why...

542
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,550
(It's a mess.)

543
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,550
You...

544
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,420
- It's not coming off at all.
- Hold on.

545
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,680
(He uses both hands,
but nothing is working.)

546
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,650
- Hey, this isn't working.
- Let's take our time.

547
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,050
- Let us work on you too.
- It's not coming off.

548
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,620
- Let us work on you too.
- It's not coming off at all.

549
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,720
Something has gone wrong.

550
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,490
- It's not coming off at all.
- Who's next?

551
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,360
This isn't right.
We're having a mental breakdown.

552
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,830
Jong Min.

553
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,660
But yesterday...

554
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,730
(He's the most flustered one
of them all.)

555
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,230
(Resting his forehead on his hand)

556
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,240
Hold on, everyone.

557
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,770
(They bring in a new tool,
the cleansing tissue.)

558
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,570
- Hold on. Let's continue.
- What's that? Give that to me.

559
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,740
- Come on.
- Use that to wipe.

560
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,080
(Will the black cream come off
with the cleansing tissue?)

561
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,140
Wipe it off.

562
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,910
- It's working.
- What a relief.

563
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,650
- It's coming off.
- What a relief.

564
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,050
Go easy on his face.

565
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,520
- I'll pull it out.
- Okay.

566
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,120
- Hold on.
- Hey. Wait.

567
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,190
(They're no longer
black dol hareubang.)

568
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,360
Gosh, it's coming off really well.

569
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,830
What a relief.

570
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,130
Step back.

571
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,730
- Hurry up.
- Are you up next?

572
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Grab that.

573
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,740
(They're slowly transforming
into celebrities.)

574
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,910
- We must check for details.
- Fifteen seconds!

575
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,210
- Wipe that part.
- More.

576
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,310
- Open your eyes.
- That's good.

577
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,310
(Both teams give it their all
as they're nearing the end.)

578
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,320
- We must wipe each other's face.
- Ten,

579
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,580
- We can only work on one person.
- nine,

580
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,890
- eight, seven,
- Sae Ho. Let me.

581
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,350
six, five, four,

582
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,860
- three,
- Rinse it.

583
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,760
- two, one.
- Okay.

584
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,090
(The 3rd round is over.)

585
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,130
Okay!

586
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,130
He looks like himself.

587
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,240
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

588
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,740
Is this good?

589
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,440
My gosh. We're doomed.

590
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,780
You have a scary face.

591
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,080
- Yes.
- Hey, your forehead...

592
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,710
My gosh. That's...

593
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,850
Yes. We have to check everything.

594
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,020
My gosh.

595
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,430
(Team Pure-Blooded
versus Team Along with Joon)

596
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,490
- Many staff members...
- Yes?

597
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,030
evaluated your performance.

598
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,200
- Gosh. The foaming cleanser...
- All right.

599
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,030
- The Dinner Game...
- What?

600
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,800
(Which team is the final winner
of the Jeju Makeover Challenge?)

601
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,240
Team Pure-Blooded
is the final winner.

602
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,870
(Team Pure-Blooded wins!)

603
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,910
By the way...

604
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,680
(They fail to acquire dinner.)

605
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,580
By the way,
you haven't seen your faces yet.

606
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,750
- But your faces...
- Really?

607
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,620
(They look in the mirror to check.)

608
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,050
I told you
we had to be more thorough.

609
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,960
I have a lot of stains on my face.

610
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,960
I wouldn't have taken off my pants
had I known we would lose.

611
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,860
You know?

612
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,630
But given how we lost this game,
I'm not in the mood...

613
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,000
to eat dinner.

614
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,300
Right?
I lost my appetite for any food.

615
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,740
Give me whatever food you have.

616
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,040
I just need to quell my hunger
and go to sleep.

617
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,280
I'll just play a game
for the mission tomorrow morning...

618
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,980
and then go home.

619
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,780
- Don't you agree?
- Yes.

620
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,110
- Do you want to eat?
- I don't.

621
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,150
Right?

622
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,750
I'm not hungry.

623
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,020
(Even Joon has no appetite.)

624
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,520
- I have no appetite.
- Don't you feel the same way?

625
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,160
- Great job, everyone.
- Of course, we did a great job.

626
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,020
Did I say otherwise?

627
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,330
You know? I mean,
he's pointing out the obvious.

628
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,930
All right.
Let's go inside for your dinner.

629
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,330
- Where are you going?
- This way?

630
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,030
It's in the next building.

631
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,070
- Really?
- Yes.

632
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,510
(Everyone shows up,
freshly cleaned up.)

633
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,170
- All right. This is our table.
- What?

634
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,410
This is nice.

635
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,580
- Let's eat since we worked hard.
- My gosh. Yes. Jong Min.

636
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,450
- You sit in the middle.
- What's this?

637
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,110
Let's eat a lot
since we worked hard.

638
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,650
Gosh, these are the special cuts.

639
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,520
The special cuts.

640
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,650
(Their hard work is rewarded
with special cuts.)

641
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,220
What do you think about this meal
with special cuts?

642
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,090
- This looks great.
- Gosh, it looks great.

643
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,630
The meat has a great color.

644
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,330
The black pork looks beautiful.

645
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,760
(It has a brilliant color.)

646
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,670
(Pork neck, thin skirt, gabrisal,
pork jowl, collar butt, pork temple)

647
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,800
(An assembly of texture masters)

648
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,270
You may grill the meat and enjoy it.

649
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,370
- Really?
- Thank you for the food.

650
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,410
Thank you.

651
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,340
Se Yoon, can you add some garlic
to the salted anchovies?

652
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,680
- It should be added.
- That's a good idea.

653
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
You have to add it
to the salted anchovies.
I'll add it.

654
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,810
- Exactly.
- Yes.

655
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,850
I'll grill the meat now.

656
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,420
So it can be cooked right away.

657
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,550
- Which cut is it?
- I don't know.

658
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,220
That's called collar butt.

659
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,960
- This?
- It's the back of the pig's neck.

660
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,590
It's very chewy.

661
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,290
(It has an outstanding
chewy texture.)

662
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,430
Can you film this? This part.

663
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,160
- Will you film it?
- Can you lower your head?

664
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,230
It's collar butt.

665
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,500
Press the back.

666
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,800
Behind the neck.

667
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,500
(A real-life image
of different cuts)

668
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,900
Take a look.

669
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,110
- Oh, my.
- I can't look at this.

670
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,910
It's really delicious.

671
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,840
The meat is very firm.

672
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,980
(As the taste is familiar,
collar butt is harder to resist.)

673
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,350
Since we're in Jeju,
bracken is served.

674
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,720
Bracken is very delicious
on Jeju Island.

675
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,020
It's plump.

676
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,090
We need to discuss.

677
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,420
What should we do from now on?

678
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,990
(Analyzing the reason
for their defeat)

679
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,520
The three of us don't make
a bad team.

680
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,560
- We did well.
- We aren't a bad team,

681
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,530
- but we're missing something.
- It wasn't Joon's fault.

682
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,060
It wasn't Joon's fault this time.

683
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,760
- I did well today.
- Team Pure-Blooded was too good.

684
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What are you doing this Sunday?

685
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,530
If you're free,
let's get together for a meeting.

686
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm serious. Let's discuss.

687
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,270
Notify your musical team
that you won't be able to make it.

688
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,470
(Ask the musical team
for their understanding.)

689
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,470
Actually, you should perform.

690
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,970
We'll wait
until your performance ends.

691
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,140
- Outside the theater?
- We need to practice playing games.

692
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,550
It's near my house,

693
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,810
so I'll come and pick you up.

694
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,820
Right.

695
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,320
(With Joon forever)

696
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,220
- I should get ready.
- The meat is almost cooked.

697
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,220
- Really?
- The thin pieces.
I'll eat it with this.

698
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,320
You can eat the thin pieces.

699
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,930
It looks delicious.

700
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,890
(Golden)

701
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,500
(Spacing out)

702
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,570
Can we eat two pieces at a time?

703
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,870
Of course.

704
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,870
- There's a lot of meat.
- Thank you.

705
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,940
(They can even eat
three pieces at a time.)

706
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,410
I'll eat two pieces at a time.

707
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,310
(Aren't you jealous?)

708
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,510
The meat looks very delicious
as it's being grilled.

709
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,480
(2 pieces of meat
with 1 garlic clove)

710
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,580
Let's go, Team Pure-Blooded.

711
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,220
- Let's go!
- Eat two pieces at the same time.

712
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,250
All right.

713
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,190
(Taking a big bite)

714
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,060
It's really good.

715
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,630
It's so good.

716
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,530
It's nice and firm.

717
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,830
The meat is nice and firm.
It's really delicious.

718
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,270
It's nice and firm.

719
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,640
- What's this?
- It's excellent.

720
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,940
- Is it good?
- The black pork is very good.

721
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,010
(Drooling...)

722
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,250
(a lot)

723
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,950
- How is it so good?
- The texture is amazing.

724
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,020
(They love the firm texture.)

725
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,580
- The special cuts are...
- Yes.

726
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,990
- The meat is very good.
- It's delicious.

727
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,420
(The special cuts
are especially good.)

728
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,760
It also tastes outstanding
with some bracken.

729
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,790
Yes.

730
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,290
(Eating)

731
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,830
(He also takes a bite.)

732
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,470
(Black pork and bracken
make a perfect match.)

733
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,300
These cuts are unbelievable.

734
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,740
They're unbelievably good.

735
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,840
Right.

736
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,340
(Gosh, it looks delicious.)

737
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,610
Can we have a little?

738
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,710
(Begging)

739
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,450
Since everyone worked hard,
you deserve to eat.

740
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,510
- We'll bring you food right away.
- Right away?

741
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,350
- They didn't even win.
- I know.

742
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,220
It looks like rice.

743
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,350
Is it rice with a stew?

744
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,860
Rice. You got some food.

745
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,020
- Gosh, that's nice.
- It looks quite good.

746
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,390
- That's not bad at all.
- Of course not.

747
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,230
It looks okay.

748
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,230
There isn't enough broth.

749
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,630
This is fine.

750
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,270
- Give me some vegetables.
- The cabbage is delicious.

751
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,740
- Thank you for the food.
- Please enjoy.

752
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,970
It's hard to remove dirt
from my nails.

753
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,340
(Delicious)

754
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,380
This cheonggukjang is good.

755
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,550
(Savory cheonggukjang is also good,
but...)

756
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,980
(Glancing)

757
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,250
Isn't the meat flavor amazing?

758
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,150
The meat flavor is great.

759
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,520
- Isn't it as good as beef?
- Yes.

760
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,060
The pork flavor is excellent
once you fall in love with it.

761
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,860
Honestly,
I'd be satisfied with this meal,

762
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,230
but looking at them makes it hard.

763
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,230
I agree.

764
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,900
(A fantastic combination of
the smell and the sizzling sound)

765
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,170
I can't stop eating it.

766
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,270
(A fantastic combination of
the smell and the sizzling sound)

767
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,340
- It doesn't look cooked.
- Can you give me some earplugs?

768
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,240
To block that sound.

769
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,440
Isn't the sizzling sound insane?

770
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,640
Honestly,

771
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,910
what we're eating is good,

772
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,010
but having the meat next to us...

773
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,550
Team Along with Joon,
aren't you curious...

774
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,890
about how the special cuts taste?

775
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,420
Yes, I'd like to know.

776
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,190
I'll give you
a very simple mission...

777
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,190
to allow just one person...

778
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,930
to taste the cut of your choice.

779
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,260
(A chance to taste a special cut)

780
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,570
If Team Pure-Blooded is okay
with it,

781
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,870
we'll give a generous amount
in a small dish for soy sauce.

782
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,870
Okay.

783
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,840
- About that much...
- That's fine.

784
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,170
- Are you okay with it?
- Yes.

785
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,410
That should be okay.

786
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,540
We're on Jeju Island.

787
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,640
They deserve to taste some.

788
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,080
(Today's relief mission)

789
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,380
From the bundle of bracken,

790
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,850
the member who picks
the longest bracken will get...

791
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,250
to taste a special cut.

792
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,490
Okay.

793
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,990
- You're out if it breaks.
- Can I pick with my hand?

794
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,290
- You can pick it with your hand.
- Okay.

795
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,230
You must pick whatever you touch.

796
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,530
(After observing
the bracken carefully)

797
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,000
Okay, here I go.

798
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,360
(He picked one.)

799
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,370
(It’s disadvantageous
if the first one is long.)

800
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
(What will be the result?)

801
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,040
What?

802
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,910
Why is it so short?

803
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,240
(Why did it snap already?)

804
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,510
Is it over already?

805
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,650
- Here I go.
- Go.

806
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,150
Please put it down.

807
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,750
Joon is really...

808
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,750
(Joon is so unlucky.)

809
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,850
No matter how hard Joon tries,

810
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,090
nothing is working out
for him today.

811
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,790
- This could be the longest.
- Right.

812
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,490
I'll go ahead.

813
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,130
Look how short mine is.

814
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,730
It's over once it snaps.

815
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,430
Pull it out at once.

816
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,270
It's done.

817
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,040
- Did Joon survive?
- Joon won.

818
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,840
- Joon won.
- Okay.

819
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,410
I have to pick a good one.

820
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,380
- Let's go!
- Who?

821
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,380
Cho Sae Ho can do it.

822
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,780
(He cheers for himself.)

823
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,880
It's shorter than you think.

824
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,150
- I picked one.
- Okay.

825
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,520
It's over once it snaps.

826
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,390
- It will snap.
- It might be long.

827
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,430
(All three of them have
about the same length.)

828
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,760
(Did I win 1st place?)

829
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,530
- Joon.
- Joon.

830
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,970
- Mine is the shortest.
- Joon.

831
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,240
(Sae Ho, Seon Ho, Joon)

832
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,610
- Mine is the shortest.
- Joon.

833
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,140
- Gosh, Joon.
- Oh, my.

834
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,580
- Your small plate.
- Joon, bring it.

835
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,050
What's going on?

836
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,980
- I'm fine.
- There was this one.

837
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,320
- Did you win?
- Joon got lucky this time.

838
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,650
Pork neck is ready.

839
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,360
- Mine wasn't very long.
- Try some pork neck.

840
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,220
Take some pork neck.

841
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,230
Okay.

842
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,530
- Mine wasn't very long.
- Take this.

843
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,230
My teammates.

844
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,770
He asked us to join his team.

845
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,900
Honestly, I didn't want to join him.

846
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,630
- Hey, he kept...
- I'll be honest.

847
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,070
I didn't want to join his team.

848
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,870
I wanted to join the other team.

849
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,940
- Have some bracken.
- No.

850
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,610
He only took meat.

851
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,680
(Only meat)

852
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,910
(Anticipating the first bite
of the special cut)

853
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,980
How does it taste?

854
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,450
(His eyes widen.)

855
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,120
Is there any salt?

856
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,720
- My teammates.
- Can I try a piece?

857
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
What?

858
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,920
- Well done.
- Okay.

859
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,160
- I will...
- Thank you.

860
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,460
- share it with you.
- Thank you.

861
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,760
- Thank you.
- Please eat.

862
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,530
(Let's comfort ourselves
with savory meat.)

863
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,300
Can I get some salt?

864
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,730
- What?
- Over there...

865
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,040
- I can sprinkle some on your face.
- Go ahead.

866
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,570
- Which salt?
- The pink salt.

867
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,370
Sprinkle a lot on it.

868
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,780
- That's great.
- Yes.

869
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,750
Can you sprinkle more
like Chef Choi Hyun Seok?

870
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,880
(One more time
like Chef Choi Hyun Seok)

871
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,780
That's nice.

872
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,220
(Clinking with salt)

873
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,250
Is it good?

874
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,990
This is good.

875
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,230
(In awe)

876
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,630
This is good.

877
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,600
(The more you chew,
the more the special cut tastes savory.)

878
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,400
It's so good that it's annoying.

879
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,130
- We can win next time.
- Let's win.

880
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,000
I wish I could have
one more bite of the meat.

881
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,970
- You want 1 more bite of the meat?
- Just 1 more bite.

882
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,210
Don't you agree?

883
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,210
Yes.

884
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,580
He should have some more
to be happy.

885
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,550
- Let's give him a piece.
- Thank you.

886
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,750
Take this greasy piece of pork neck.

887
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,850
- Gosh.
- Take it.

888
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,720
This is for Seon Ho.

889
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,320
- However,
- Pork neck.

890
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,430
to enjoy this piece completely,

891
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,430
- eat it with anything you want.
- Anything.

892
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,500
- Make the perfect wrap.
- Thank you.

893
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,100
You'll be eating everything
Jeju has to offer.

894
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,170
(Jeju in one bite)

895
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,330
That sounds good.

896
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,530
Let me know if you want more.

897
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,370
(Stacking up food neatly
to make a wrap)

898
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,010
Thanks to you, I get to
take a bite as big as I want.

899
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,210
- Wrap it with dried laver.
- Thank you.

900
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,410
I'm happy today.

901
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,980
(Eating)

902
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,920
(It doesn't take much to be happy.)

903
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,660
- That was nice.
- It's really good.

904
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,760
(Happiness is sharing delicious food
with good people.)

905
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,830
What?

906
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,230
It was a good day today.

907
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,000
- We finished it all.
- It was delicious.

908
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,570
(Everyone is happy
at the end of dinner.)

909
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,570
You worked very hard...

910
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,810
during the expedition today.

911
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,310
For tomorrow, on Jeju Island...

912
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,680
- Expedition?
- We will decide...

913
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
your last expedition.

914
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,080
Are we deciding it now?

915
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,780
Is this really happening?

916
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,420
- It's starting now.
- Deciding it now means...

917
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,850
that it will take place
tomorrow morning.

918
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,920
- Wait.
- It must be hiking.

919
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,950
I have a question.

920
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,490
Would you be willing...

921
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,720
to play a team game?

922
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,930
A team game?

923
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,490
- They're thinking.
- No.

924
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,530
You're thinking hard about it.

925
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,370
Even as a beginner,
I can easily tell...

926
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,000
what it will be.

927
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,170
All of us expect it to be...

928
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,970
- hiking Mount Halla.
- Everyone.

929
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,010
"Life is C between B and D."

930
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,340
"Life is C..."

931
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,740
"between B and D."

932
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,050
- Isn't that right?
- What does it mean?

933
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,780
It's about the choice
between birth and death.

934
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:50,420
(Life is a choice
between birth and death.)

935
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,390
For your last expedition tomorrow,
there are two types.

936
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,390
What?

937
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,760
This is so nerve-racking.

938
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,030
- My goodness.
- It must be Mount Halla.

939
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,260
It's up to luck. It can't be helped.

940
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,230
You'll find out what type
of expedition it is...

941
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,370
once you get there.

942
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,100
Will we go there without knowing?

943
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,400
Each of you will be going there now.

944
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,140
- Each of us?
- You'll know when you get there.

945
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,610
Let's say our two choices are...

946
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,980
- A and B.
- What if everyone picks A?

947
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,980
- It could be 4 to 2 or 5 to 1.
- Yes.

948
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,210
Will that not matter?

949
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,480
Each room can accommodate
three people.

950
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,590
(Inside the members' lodging)

951
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:28,790
(There are 2 rooms,
and each accommodates 3 people.)

952
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,990
(Room D for 3 people)

953
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,960
(Choose 1 of the 2 rooms)

954
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,300
(Expedition sites will be revealed
once they make their choice.)

955
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,570
Let's say that there's a room
for Mount Halla.

956
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,540
Three people chose that room.

957
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,540
Then...

958
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,210
- In that case,
- The others can't go there?

959
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,710
the remaining members
can't go there?

960
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,410
Then it's better to choose later.

961
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,410
You never know.

962
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,380
If the other room is full,

963
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,880
you have to go to Mount Halla.

964
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,080
Are we going to Mount Halla?
Why are we assuming that?

965
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,750
Why aren't you negating it?

966
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,420
Tell us where we're going.

967
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,820
So we can prepare ourselves
before going to sleep.

968
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,860
Why do you look so sad?

969
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,460
Why do you look so sad?

970
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,760
(Viewers, we will tell you first.)

971
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,830
(One of them is
going to Mount Halla.)

972
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,670
Since the maximum number
of people is three,

973
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,900
the order of choosing
is also important.

974
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,010
Please decide
in which order you'll choose.

975
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,310
Shall we pick bracken again?

976
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,840
- Let's do that.
- What bracken?

977
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,180
- Bracken is over there.
- Okay.

978
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,640
- With the remaining bracken.
- Let's go with luck.

979
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,680
- Let's pick bracken.
- In the order of who picks...

980
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
- the longest bracken?
- Yes.

981
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,380
Let's see.

982
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,020
That doesn't look bad.

983
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,190
It doesn't look bad.

984
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,320
That looks good.

985
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,820
(Jong Min is the second person
to pick.)

986
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,690
- Gosh.
- It's not that long.

987
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,020
It's long.

988
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,290
Pull it out quickly.

989
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,330
(Se Yoon picks one
with his thick hand.)

990
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,830
(Sighing)

991
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,930
- It's very short.
- I'm going next.

992
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,670
- The longest one is mine.
- Okay.

993
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,240
- Here I go.
- DinDin is in second place.

994
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,540
- I'll go right away.
- DinDin is in second place.

995
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,310
Didn't it snap?

996
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,210
(Sae Ho and Joon also picked
their bracken.)

997
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,380
Joon is in last place.

998
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,940
- Joon is in last place.
- Joon is in last place.

999
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,010
Joon is in last place.

1000
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,650
All right, tell me
in which order you'll choose.

1001
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,780
- I'm number one.
- This is insane.

1002
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,920
I'm number two.

1003
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,390
(The order of choosing the room)

1004
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,650
(Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

1005
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,090
My goodness. Look.

1006
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:12,460
(More vivid and thrilling
than any other expedition so far)

1007
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:21,900
(The last game
for their last expedition)

1008
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,740
(What will be the members' fate?)

1009
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,680
This is the last one.

1010
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,610
- All right.
- My goodness.

1011
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,650
- Sae Ho.
- Number one.

1012
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,180
- Okay.
- Good luck.

1013
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,590
- Go.
- We'll meet somewhere.

1014
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,850
I bet Se Yoon...

1015
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,820
- and I'll go to Mount Halla.
- I can do it.

1016
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,990
- It's because...
- Me?

1017
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,290
- What?
- Why me?

1018
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,430
That's just how I feel.

1019
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,400
Fortunately, you were wrong
about everything today.

1020
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,000
(Sae Ho heads to pick
one of the rooms.)

1021
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,040
(Watch me.)

1022
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,710
(He faces two rooms with a sigh.)

1023
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,850
(Glancing)

1024
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,220
(Glancing)

1025
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,190
It's driving me crazy.

1026
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:21,200
(Which room will be Mount Halla?)

1027
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,270
I think these members
will go to Mount Halla.

1028
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,840
You, you, and me.

1029
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,000
- Who?
- That's good.

1030
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,670
- Who?
- You, me, and Joon.

1031
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,810
I don't think so.

1032
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,710
- That wouldn't be good.
- We'll find out.

1033
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,010
Next up is Jong Min.

1034
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,510
- Jong Min.
- That's me.

1035
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,250
- Okay.
- Be careful. It's slippery.

1036
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,610
Jong Min.

1037
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,450
(Good luck, Jong Min.)

1038
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,290
(Jong Min moves
while looking around in doubt.)

1039
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,360
What is it?

1040
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
Sae Ho.

1041
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,600
What's this?

1042
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,430
Between B and D.

1043
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,300
Choice.

1044
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,370
Sae Ho!

1045
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,640
(Sae Ho has already picked a room.)

1046
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,080
How can I make a choice
without knowing anything?

1047
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,080
I can't base my deduction
on anything.

1048
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,380
(Scratching)

1049
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,450
I will choose in a direct way.

1050
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:22,460
(Jong Min opens a door and enters.)

1051
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,930
(No one is here?)

1052
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,330
Gosh, you startled me.

1053
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,570
(Welcome, it's good to see you.)

1054
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,740
(Sae Ho picked Room D
after thinking hard.)

1055
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,610
I picked death on purpose,

1056
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,810
hoping that it's the opposite.

1057
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,550
I picked this because...

1058
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,150
Here's what I think.

1059
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,490
Inside the room for Mount Halla,

1060
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,090
there might be some kind of gear.

1061
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:58,560
(Are there hiking gear
in the room next door?)

1062
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,370
(Seon Ho is the third one to enter.)

1063
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,770
I've worked hard in my life.

1064
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,270
I've been good.

1065
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,120
(As they hear someone approaching,
they switch to hide-and-seek mode.)

1066
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,180
The first thing
B reminds me of is...

1067
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,890
birds.

1068
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,990
B, I, R, D.

1069
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,560
D reminds me of dive.

1070
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,760
We will have to dive.

1071
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,790
Pain.

1072
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:35,160
(What will be Seon Ho's choice?)

1073
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,430
(Knocking)

1074
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,310
(If Seon Ho comes into Room D)

1075
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,410
I have no choice,

1076
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,680
but miraculously, I was wrong
in every O-X quiz today.

1077
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,150
(Will Seon Ho pick Room D?)

1078
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,480
My goodness.

1079
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,920
(The tension makes him
take another breath.)

1080
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,960
Seon Ho, hurry up!

1081
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,720
Why is he taking so long?

1082
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,990
He's being funny.

1083
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,830
It's based on luck anyway.

1084
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,960
What is there to think about?

1085
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,900
Joon reminds me of Park Young Gyu...

1086
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,170
in "Soonpoong Clinic" in his prime.

1087
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,200
(Scolding angrily just like him)

1088
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,770
Aren't I right? It's based on luck.

1089
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,210
(Frustrated)

1090
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,240
(Getting up)

1091
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,310
Why... What is he doing?

1092
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,380
Next.

1093
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,950
- Cheol, let's do it fast.
- DinDin.

1094
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,310
- Hey.
- Let's do it fast.

1095
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,020
Why do I feel like
you and I went through this before?

1096
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,820
- Please.
- DinDin.

1097
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,920
- Make your choice fast.
- DinDin.

1098
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,120
- It's based on luck anyway.
- Let me choose as well.

1099
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,790
- Okay.
- It's all about luck. Just do it.

1100
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,960
- I want to make a choice.
- Don't think about it.

1101
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,260
Don't leave me with him.

1102
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,360
It's 1 a.m. already.

1103
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,270
Don't say that.
It's 7 p.m. for the viewers.

1104
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,570
Who cares?

1105
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,240
I have to get up early tomorrow
to go to Mount Halla.

1106
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,140
It's 7 p.m. for the viewers.

1107
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,340
- That's true.
- For you, it's 1 a.m.

1108
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,210
(Sighing)

1109
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,780
Please!

1110
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,020
B and D.

1111
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,020
D and D.

1112
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,660
Since I'm DinDin, I pick D.

1113
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,560
I pick D.

1114
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,230
- Where are we going?
- What?

1115
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,530
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

1116
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,730
- You don't know yet?
- No.

1117
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,140
- You don't know?
- No.

1118
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,070
Can you take out the blanket?

1119
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,170
Blanket?

1120
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,170
(Screaming)

1121
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,570
What?

1122
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,140
(Sae Ho jumps out of the closet.)

1123
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,610
- Why are you here?
- What?

1124
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,650
Birth.
It means that you're being born.

1125
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,980
Being born anew.
It must be Mount Halla.

1126
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,020
I'm going to Room D.

1127
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,920
(Surprisingly,
all three went to Room D.)

1128
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,790
- What? It's over.
- What? It's over.

1129
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,660
(Jong Min, Sae Ho,
and Seon Ho picked Room D.)

1130
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,400
- There are three of us.
- This is crazy.

1131
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,730
Seriously?

1132
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,700
- We all picked the same room.
- All of us?

1133
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,870
- Why are you here?
- What?

1134
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,270
DinDin, please go to Room B.

1135
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,270
All three of us picked this room.

1136
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,940
Everyone came here so far.

1137
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,010
He's shocked.

1138
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,890
(DinDin is sent to Room B.)

1139
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,490
Why does it feel so tense here?

1140
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,090
(It seems ominous.)

1141
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,520
- Please.
- Things like this...

1142
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,190
Don't let me be
in the same room as Joon.

1143
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,960
This is driving me crazy.

1144
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,630
Okay, Se Yoon. Please go.

1145
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,900
Here's what I think.

1146
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,270
You won't have any choice,
but I won't either.

1147
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,170
That's also how I feel.

1148
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,480
Se Yoon, can you choose quickly?

1149
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,280
We won't get to sleep much.
We'll go to Mount Hall anyway.

1150
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,180
We'll be going there anyway.

1151
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,720
(Hopeless)

1152
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,950
Obese.

1153
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,190
Diet?

1154
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,690
Obese and diet?

1155
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,330
(Sighing)

1156
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,560
Please, or I'll die.

1157
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,960
(Please save me.)

1158
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,900
(Will Se Yoon pick B or D?)

1159
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,300
(Peekaboo)

1160
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,000
(What?)

1161
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,170
- What's going on?
- This is so fascinating.

1162
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,440
Psychologically...

1163
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,980
Isn't the way we think
so fascinating?

1164
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,180
The elders are here.

1165
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,720
There are gear inside the closet.

1166
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,450
- What?
- There are gear in here.

1167
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,890
- In here? What gear?
- Yes.

1168
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,920
(Gosh)

1169
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,360
(Here's the youngest.)

1170
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,230
(He took a big hit.)

1171
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,230
(Laughing)

1172
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,500
Se Yoon flew.

1173
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,630
(He almost flew.)

1174
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,700
You startled me.

1175
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,000
- Is it the three of you?
- Yes.

1176
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,240
I don't think this one is good.

1177
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,110
Joon will be coming here.
We're doomed.

1178
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,780
I don't want to be
in the same room as Joon.

1179
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,780
Me neither.

1180
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,980
(Where is it?)

1181
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,590
What is there to think about?

1182
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,160
You just need to pick any room.

1183
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,360
(Going straight energetically)

1184
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,590
(He chose "D" as expected.)

1185
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,630
What?

1186
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,100
(He got surprised
just as the other two did.)

1187
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,870
(And he was moved to Room B
as he was supposed to.)

1188
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,000
You're not surprised. Why?

1189
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,100
I already went into the other room
and came here.

1190
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,570
- We're done for as Joon is here.
- Hey.

1191
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,370
- Hey, leave the room.
- Sorry?

1192
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,370
Get out of here.

1193
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,880
Apparently, the 1st 3 members
chose the other room.

1194
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,940
All of us chose this room,
which makes me anxious.

1195
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,740
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- Right?

1196
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,710
We were all drawn to this room
for some reason.

1197
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,250
(The room selection is finalized.)

1198
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,280
(Which of the rooms could be
for the Mount Halla adventure?)

1199
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,220
- Really?
- But we don't know the result.

1200
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,320
That's true, but...

1201
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,190
See? We don't know yet.
Why the long face?

1202
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,960
You came here. That's why.

1203
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,860
(Am I the result?)

1204
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,900
- Do you really not know?
- Why are you being like this to me?

1205
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,560
Finding out the result
is not important.

1206
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,770
You coming here...

1207
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,170
tells us the result.

1208
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,640
Isn't it hard to believe
that all six of us chose this room?

1209
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,400
- It is, indeed.
- It had no chance of happening.

1210
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,410
It doesn't make sense.

1211
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,140
But this room may be the lucky room.

1212
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,610
- Right.
- It'd be nice if that's the case.

1213
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,810
- This room may be the lucky room.
- Let's think that way for now.

1214
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,750
Why would you think
we'll definitely go there?

1215
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,480
Everyone, please come out now.

1216
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,980
Let's go for it with confidence!

1217
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,550
- Please.
- It's really hard to believe.

1218
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,320
- Please.
- All six of us chose the same room.

1219
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,120
- How did we all go to that room?
- We all chose the same room.

1220
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,790
It's unbelievable that
all six of us chose Room D.

1221
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,860
Now...

1222
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,660
Has it been decided?

1223
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,400
Do you have a hunch
about where you'll go tomorrow?

1224
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,500
We don't need a hunch.
Joon came to the same room as us.

1225
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
(Sad premonition)

1226
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,200
- Maybe Joon brought good luck.
- Joon came to our room.

1227
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,540
Now that it's past midnight,

1228
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,180
- his daily fate has changed.
- His fate has changed.

1229
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,610
- Okay.
- You chose one of these, right?

1230
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,710
His hands are shaking.

1231
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,880
Is it written on the back of those?

1232
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,780
- Which one shall I reveal first?
- That's right.

1233
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,080
- That makes sense too.
- For the show to be fun...

1234
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,290
Yes?

1235
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,990
- "D" should be the bad one.
- Right.

1236
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,320
- We didn't have a choice. Right?
- Exactly.

1237
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,190
I find it so hard to believe.

1238
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,790
Please reveal "D" first.

1239
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,630
I will reveal "D."

1240
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,160
The energy of Joon...

1241
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,530
Wait. Should I just listen?
What should I do?

1242
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,140
Here we go.

1243
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,870
- The look on his face isn't good.
- I think we'll go to Mount Halla.

1244
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,540
Please take it off slowly.

1245
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,040
No.

1246
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,280
- Slowly.
- He seems quite bitter.

1247
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,350
Just take it off already.

1248
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,450
- Darn it.
- What is it? Show us.

1249
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,520
- All right.
- Those are dolphins.

1250
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,580
- You will go on an adventure...
- Dolphins.

1251
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,320
- They're dolphins.
- of the discovery...

1252
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,750
of the Jeju sea treasure,

1253
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,020
- Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins.
- Oh, yes.

1254
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,460
(3 members)

1255
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,160
(Dolphin, 3 members)

1256
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:17,400
(Jong Min, Sae Ho, and Seon Ho
will go on a search for dolphins.)

1257
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,270
- Isn't this the harder one?
- No.

1258
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,800
- We have to go to the sea.
- That's not a problem.

1259
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,770
- But dolphins rarely appear.
- It happens rarely.

1260
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,310
You must find a dolphin...

1261
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,340
- to get off work tomorrow.
- What?

1262
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,410
- But... I mean, I know this.
- We can't go home if we don't?

1263
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,780
If we go out to the sea
around Jeju Island,

1264
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,750
we can see many dolphins.

1265
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,780
- I know. Of course, I know that.
- I guess we have to film them.

1266
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,990
But they might not appear
due to the bad weather.

1267
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,020
Listen to me.

1268
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,660
Tae Hyun once went out to the sea
to see dolphins,

1269
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,660
but he failed to find them.
So he had to go back there later.

1270
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,960
(He keeps throwing a wet blanket.)

1271
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,590
Come on. Stop saying such a thing.
I can't believe you.

1272
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,600
It's a true story.

1273
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,630
You know... I can guarantee you.

1274
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,000
I saw dolphins
every time I came to Jeju Island.

1275
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,940
(If one is the sea,)

1276
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:03,910
(the other must be the mountain.)

1277
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,980
- I don't know.
- Seriously, what's your problem?

1278
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,090
(Sighing)

1279
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,490
You should check it.
You don't know yet.

1280
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,760
Earlier, Joon said he thought...

1281
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,760
- that these three of them would go.
- The members who chose Room D.

1282
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:15,960
- This is really important.
- Yes.

1283
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,660
Se Yoon, Joon, and DinDin...

1284
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,660
(The three of them were kicked out
and moved to Room B.)

1285
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,030
- Maybe they'll just go home.
- They'll go home?

1286
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:21,360
They'll go home without a mission?

1287
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,360
Please.

1288
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,770
(Please.)

1289
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,270
- Get off work?
- Please.

1290
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Yes. Take it off.

1291
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,770
What?

1292
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,670
- All right.
- It's almost touching the sky.

1293
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,410
You will go and explore the treasure
of Mount Halla,

1294
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,610
which is one of the best mountains
in Korea.

1295
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,610
It is situated
1,660m above the sea level.

1296
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,680
(The treasure of Mount Halla
situated 1,660m above the sea level)

1297
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,580
You will explore Baekrok Spring.

1298
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,580
- Baekrok Spring?
- Yes!

1299
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,220
(They'll go hiking after all!)

1300
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
We can relax now.

1301
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,420
What's Baekrok Spring?

1302
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,460
(Baekrok Spring?)

1303
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,360
(Located south of Lake Baengnok)

1304
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,760
It's a spring.

1305
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,430
It used to be...

1306
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,900
a restricted area.

1307
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,070
(Baekrok Spring will be revealed
on TV for the first time.)

1308
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,870
- This is a benefit.
- They should be grateful.

1309
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:03,940
This is a benefit.

1310
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,510
You can't get a chance to see it,
even if you're willing to pay.

1311
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,010
- Should I stop teasing them?
- Just be quiet.

1312
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,080
Okay. I'll do that.

1313
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,280
(6 hours later)

1314
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,580
(My gosh. The wind is so strong.)

1315
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,550
(The worst condition
in the history of 2 Days and 1 Night)

1316
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,820
(Please look forward to seeing
the legendary hike.)

1317
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,630
Right. We'll probably be knocked out
on the plane going home.

1318
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,460
Joon lost in every game we played.

1319
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,830
- It's unbelievable.
- Joon lost in every game.

1320
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:30,830
Joon lost in every game.

1321
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,970
You'll go on an adventure tomorrow,
so sleep tight.

1322
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,770
What time should we wake up
tomorrow morning?

1323
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:38,540
As for Team Baekrok Spring,
we'll wake you up...

1324
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,380
- What are you talking about?
- at 6 a.m.

1325
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,380
(Team Baekrok Spring
has to wake up at 6 a.m.)

1326
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,450
(Finding inner peace)

1327
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,680
You're doing great.

1328
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,680
(Finding inner peace)

1329
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,350
- It's 1 a.m. now.
- At 6 a.m.,

1330
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,420
- Yes.
- I'll come to wake you up.

1331
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,650
- Seon Ho.
- What about us?

1332
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:51,750
- What about Team Dolphin?
- What about Team Dolphin?

1333
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,620
- Come here. Let's go together.
- As for Team Dolphin,

1334
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,320
you have to wake up at 8:30 a.m.

1335
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,160
- That's so early.
- I'm jealous.

1336
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,460
(Read the room, will you?)

1337
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,030
(Whispering)

1338
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:04,400
Excuse me. We have to go to bed,
so let's stop chatting.

1339
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
Okay.

1340
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,440
I'll stop chatting with the others.

1341
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,010
- Right.
- You have things to do tomorrow,

1342
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,010
- so please go to bed now.
- Okay.

1343
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,640
- Got it.
- Good job, everyone.

1344
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,780
Thank you.

1345
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,540
I won't see you off.
See you tomorrow.

1346
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,680
(Se Yoon and Sae Ho
got ready for bed first.)

1347
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,450
Jong Hyun will come and wake us up,
right?

1348
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:23,720
Yes, he will.

1349
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,720
(Se Yoon is worried a lot
about hiking.)

1350
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,020
Goodness.

1351
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,260
I wish
I could go up there with my friend.

1352
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,160
- I know.
- It's a shame.

1353
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
(The same age friends are sad
as they can't go together.)
Exactly.

1354
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,430
You chose Room D.

1355
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,600
I can't believe
all six of us went to Room D.

1356
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,670
Exactly.

1357
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,930
I'm going to get some rest now.

1358
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:43,040
I thought we might go to Mount Halla
since we were coming to Jeju Island.

1359
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,040
I knew it when I heard
we were going to come here.

1360
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,040
(They thought of Mount Halla
when they heard about the shoot.)

1361
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,910
I was 100 percent sure
some of us would go to Mount Halla.

1362
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,110
But I didn't know
if I would be chosen.

1363
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,850
I knew I would be chosen.

1364
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,950
(Joon had predicted
his fate already.)

1365
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:55,550
I didn't know I'd be chosen.

1366
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,190
(They only share sighs and regret.)

1367
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,950
I should've done better
at picking bracken.

1368
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,090
It's okay. It might be fun.

1369
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,560
But it won't be, though. Right?

1370
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,560
It will be simply exhausting.

1371
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,660
(DinDin is sullen.)

1372
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,670
I guess you guys will ride a boat,
right?

1373
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,600
Probably.

1374
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,740
Is it true that you saw a dolphin
from a tent bar?

1375
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,270
Yes.

1376
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:16,940
Come on. Stop lying.

1377
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,680
It's true. Why would I lie?

1378
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,640
While drinking at a tent bar,

1379
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,810
he saw a dolphin swimming by.

1380
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:25,850
I think I have a photo too.

1381
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,450
But Jeju Island... I mean...

1382
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,180
Don't dolphins live in the deep sea?

1383
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,590
No, they don't.

1384
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,790
They often appear
in the shallow parts...

1385
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,760
- near a beach.
- Really?

1386
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,830
I know I have it somewhere here.

1387
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,090
(He wants to prove it's true
by showing Seon Ho the photo.)

1388
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,760
(Scrolling like crazy)

1389
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,130
I found it.

1390
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,400
(He finally found the photo
of the dolphin he saw.)

1391
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,200
Oh, my. I see that it's true.

1392
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:54,140
(The video of the dolphin
recorded by Jong Min)

1393
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,550
Wait. What is this?

1394
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,550
(But the more they see it,
the harder it is to tell.)

1395
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,750
- Is it a seal?
- Is that really a dolphin?

1396
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,220
I think it's a seal.

1397
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,620
(Now, even Jong Min is confused.)

1398
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,620
- This is driving me nuts.
- So it's not a dolphin?

1399
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,660
(The dolphin that Jong Min saw
becomes a mystery again.)

1400
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,160
- Good night, Jong Min.
- You too. Sleep well.

1401
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,530
(Seon Ho got tired while waiting
and went to sleep first.)

1402
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,900
(Jong Min, who kept searching
for a long while,)

1403
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,700
(fell asleep
after everyone else did.)

1404
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,910
(The pitch-dark night...)

1405
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:27,440
(is filled with bright light.)

1406
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:31,350
(The second day on Jeju Island
has come.)

1407
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,480
(It's bright outside already.)

1408
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,350
(But Team Baekrok Spring
is still sleeping soundly.)

1409
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,560
(Today's morning fairy,
Director Joo, appears.)

1410
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,290
(Tapping)

1411
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,960
It's time to hike, Se Yoon.

1412
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,230
(Talking quietly)

1413
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,670
(Dazed)

1414
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,340
Wake up.

1415
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,170
(After that,
he wakes Joon and DinDin up too.)

1416
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,310
Let's go hiking.

1417
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,410
(Then he leaves the room relaxedly.)

1418
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,480
(Sae Ho wakes up briefly
at the noise.)

1419
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:05,910
Have a good time.

1420
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:06,950
(Sweet)

1421
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,920
- Be careful not to hurt your legs.
- Go back to sleep.

1422
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,950
(He's always worried
about his friend.)

1423
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,820
- Jong Hyun, you be safe too.
- Got it.

1424
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,290
I'm going back to sleep.

1425
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,430
(The members of 2 Days and 1 Night
take care of each other.)

1426
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,000
(He covers Sae Ho
with the blanket thoroughly.)

1427
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,300
(Se Yoon comes out first.)

1428
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,570
(DinDin and Joon come out too.)

1429
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:27,500
I heard
we should have a hearty breakfast.

1430
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,800
So let's have breakfast first.

1431
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:30,340
Oh, it's nice.

1432
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,140
Tofu. Nice.

1433
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,140
(The food truck is waiting
for the members.)

1434
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,910
It's very windy.

1435
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,680
- "Keep out of the mountain."
- I don't think you can go.

1436
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,250
I don't have much of an appetite.

1437
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,390
(A lot of food)

1438
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:47,760
Thank you for the food.

1439
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,690
We should eat for six hours.

1440
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,530
What's happening after six hours?

1441
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,860
It's going to rain in six hours.

1442
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,900
So we should eat for six hours.

1443
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,530
(Joon has no thoughts or ideas.)

1444
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,970
Did you look up articles
about Baekrok Spring?

1445
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,710
It's open to the public
for the first time.

1446
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:07,810
- We've only heard about it.
- Really?

1447
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,780
It never gets dry.

1448
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,480
The spring is full of water.

1449
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,420
It's the highest spring water
in South Korea.

1450
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,890
It's that legendary spring water.

1451
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,960
We are lucky boys.

1452
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,830
That makes us really lucky.

1453
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,560
We can't even find...

1454
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,900
pictures of Baekrok Spring
on the Internet.

1455
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,600
- People can't visit there.
- Right.

1456
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,100
(We are the first ones to visit.)

1457
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,740
It's a new way up to Mount Halla.

1458
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,140
That's great.

1459
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,140
(I think it's worth hiking.)

1460
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,710
We are going somewhere
that hasn't been open to the public.

1461
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:46,110
I will see you here at 7:50 a.m.

1462
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,350
I'll meet you at 7:53 a.m.

1463
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:48,480
(Get ready to go to Baekrok Spring
and see you all later.)

1464
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,650
Now that we're here already,
we should all go up.

1465
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,190
- Everyone.
- Yes?

1466
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,760
You have to climb up Mount Halla.

1467
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,820
(Let's go to Mount Halla.)

1468
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,890
Get ready with your backpacks.

1469
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,200
You see the backpacks
in front of you?

1470
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,560
Please don't touch them yet.

1471
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,630
What? Are we playing a game or what?

1472
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,470
You can pick one of those.

1473
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:09,070
Only 1 bag out of these 3...

1474
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,610
has all the snacks and water.

1475
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,710
Please take note...

1476
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,240
- and choose one.
- So it must be heavier.

1477
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,240
That's right.

1478
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,850
Seon Ho was worried about me.
So he gave me this.

1479
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,920
- It's an energy gel.
- He was worried.

1480
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,850
He told me to have it
if I got exhausted.

1481
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:22,850
Okay.

1482
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,490
(We approve of Seon Ho's love
toward Se Yoon.)

1483
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,520
All right.
Which one do you want to choose?

1484
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,060
Let's pick this one right here.

1485
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:31,790
It's light.

1486
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,060
(What? This is light.)

1487
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,200
Did you mark it as red and blue?

1488
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,370
And black?

1489
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,030
I'm MBLAQ, so...

1490
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,800
Why is this so heavy?

1491
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,470
(Is it Joon again?)

1492
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:47,210
He just gets all the bad luck.

1493
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,850
- Come on.
- You're so unlucky.

1494
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,850
- Joon's so unlucky.
- MBLAQ.

1495
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,850
Are you all ready? Let's get going.

1496
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,820
(Celebrating
Visit Jeju Heritage Year,)

1497
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,460
(they're headed to find
hidden treasures in Mount Halla.)

1498
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,930
(However)

1499
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,670
(A few raindrops started to fall.)

1500
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:14,140
(It became really foggy.)

1501
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,210
(It started to rain even harder.)

1502
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,540
It's raining, but we are still...

1503
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,080
We have to go up
since we're here already.

1504
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,440
Right, let's show the spirit
of 2 Days and 1 Night.

1505
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,350
We'll come down
if things get too hard.

1506
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,480
But we'll still go up.

1507
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,120
Along with Joon.

1508
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,620
(With unlucky Joon)

1509
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,250
The staff from Mount Halla are here.

1510
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,420
We have to go with them. Hello.

1511
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,290
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

1512
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,290
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

1513
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,930
- The weather is...
- Yes.

1514
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,460
- The weather is bad.
- Right.

1515
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,870
- It's bad.
- Right?

1516
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,800
We can still go up, right?

1517
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,200
- Yes.
- So we can go up.

1518
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,240
I heard that you're going
to Baekrok Spring. Am I right?

1519
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,540
That's right. Baekrok Spring.

1520
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,810
I can't wait to get there.
I'm so excited.

1521
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,680
Baekrok Spring is...

1522
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,010
- the highest spring in Korea.
- Right.

1523
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,580
It's right below Lake Baengnok.

1524
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,920
It's at an altitude of about 1,660m.

1525
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,620
It's located in an area
that's prohibited from visiting.

1526
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,820
- So people can't visit there.
- Right.

1527
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,460
But we're celebrating
Visit Jeju Heritage Year.

1528
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,760
So we take reservations
for the month of July.

1529
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,760
For one month.

1530
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,000
Right. We open it to the public.

1531
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,740
And we're the first ones to visit.

1532
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,810
- Your team...
- It's the first time ever.

1533
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,040
is lucky to visit there.

1534
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,240
But it's raining hard today.

1535
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,540
What a lucky day.

1536
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,580
Are you going up with us?

1537
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,050
I have to be in charge
of safety management.

1538
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,280
So I have to stay behind.

1539
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,380
That's why you look happy.

1540
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,920
Is the man behind you
going up with us?

1541
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,520
- That's right.
- He's wearing something dark.

1542
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,690
And you're wearing something bright.

1543
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:43,690
(Kim Jong Gab, a researcher
at Jeju World Heritage Headquarters)

1544
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:48,230
I'm sure the audience
wants to take a look at Mount Halla.

1545
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,930
- So please enjoy.
- Of course, they're curious.

1546
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:52,200
I hope you enjoy your time there.

1547
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,640
It would have been even better
if the weather were good.

1548
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,210
- It's all because of you.
- I like it better this way.

1549
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,340
I like this better.

1550
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,780
- See you.
- Have a safe trip.

1551
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,980
- Good luck.
- Thank you. Baekrok Spring.

1552
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,820
(Let's all get hyped and go!)

1553
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,190
(Today's course: Yeongsil Trail)

1554
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,460
(Yeongsil)

1555
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,630
(A valley where deities stay)

1556
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:21,800
(The most beautiful trail
up to Mount Halla)

1557
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,870
(Follow me.)

1558
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:29,470
(Rocks of fantastic shape
created by deities)

1559
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:34,280
(Byeongpung Rocks
where deities live)

1560
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,010
(Seonjakjiwat, Garden of deities)

1561
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,490
(You can see all of these
on Yeongsil Trail.)

1562
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,560
(On their way to the final destination,
Baekrok Spring)

1563
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:52,690
I heard that the beginning
of this train is quite tough.

1564
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,130
(They say the beginning
of this course is tough.)

1565
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,930
When you go up from there,

1566
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:57,570
- it will get easier.
- Okay.

1567
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,370
It's the shortest course
to reach Witse Oreum.

1568
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:02,370
The view here is amazing.

1569
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,710
You can see the running water
of the valley.

1570
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:07,980
- It's cool.
- It's the only place with water.

1571
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,410
(The only course with running water
on Mount Halla)

1572
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,980
Is everyone coming up?

1573
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,150
You can take steps here.

1574
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:17,220
(DinDin and the staff
are all going up well.)

1575
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:21,090
(Controlling his pace)

1576
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,490
Joon, take care of DinDin.

1577
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,630
I think DinDin is the ace here.

1578
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:26,860
He's good.

1579
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,900
This was one of my dreams.

1580
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,230
- What was?
- Here?

1581
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:33,000
When I watched,
"My Lovely Sam Soon,"

1582
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,070
(When I watched "My Lovely Sam Soon"
20 years ago...)

1583
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:36,240
Sam Soon climbs up this mountain
on a rainy day.

1584
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,310
Really?

1585
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,240
I'm doing what she did.

1586
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,280
- On a rainy day...
- That's romantic.

1587
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,310
Sam Soon was also wearing
a raincoat.

1588
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,610
(One of DinDin's bucket list
was climbing up Mount Halla.)

1589
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,250
I think she broke up with Hyun Bin
in the series.

1590
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,150
She climbed up here on a rainy day
to forget him.

1591
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:50,750
- By herself?
- Yes.

1592
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,320
I think Hyun Bin came to follow her.

1593
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,490
Did he put a GPS on her?
How did he know?

1594
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,130
I'm not sure.

1595
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:03,770
(We met without any GPS.)

1596
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,530
It's so clean.

1597
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,340
- Isn't the water refreshing?
- Yes.

1598
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,570
It's amazing.

1599
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,440
The sound is very refreshing.

1600
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,740
- I know.
- It would be nice...

1601
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:14,840
to sit in the middle right there.

1602
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,250
Why don't you get
in the water for us?

1603
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,050
If we get in the water...

1604
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,050
- It's not allowed.
- You will be in trouble.

1605
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:22,650
It would be nice
to sit in the middle, right?

1606
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,150
- Right.
- It's incredible.

1607
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,150
(Let's climb up again
if you're done enjoying the view.)

1608
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,520
- Let's go up.
- I think you're going up too fast.

1609
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:29,820
- Right.
- Is he fast, or...

1610
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,990
You think I'm the fast one?

1611
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,790
This is the normal speed.

1612
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:33,800
- Really?
- Yes.

1613
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,660
It's DinDin's first time climbing up
a proper mountain.

1614
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,070
(It's his first time climbing up
on a rainy day.)

1615
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,570
(First time climbing up is so hard)

1616
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:47,280
(I never had climbing in my plan.)

1617
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,810
(It's not too tiring because they're
still in the beginning course.)

1618
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,780
I think we just passed
the first hill.

1619
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,120
(They're about to enter
the tough course.)

1620
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,250
Shall we take a big breath here?

1621
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,590
- Here?
- Yes.

1622
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,190
From here...

1623
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:03,090
The place is called Kkalddak Hill.

1624
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,190
So we won't get to smile from here.

1625
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,300
Right. You will neither smile
nor talk from this point.

1626
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,200
- We have stairs all the way up?
- That's right.

1627
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,200
(Nonstop stairs that stop you
from laughing and talking unfold.)

1628
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,270
Can you take that one out of my bag?

1629
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:13,600
(They must hydrate themselves.)

1630
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:16,940
(Walking)

1631
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,140
(Some more walking)

1632
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:24,380
(The only sound we hear
is them out of breath.)

1633
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,380
What we did earlier
wasn't even climbing.

1634
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,350
(The earlier course is more like
a walking course.)

1635
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,580
This is climbing.

1636
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,590
(This is true climbing.)

1637
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,650
It's like a StairMaster.

1638
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:34,820
(Exhausted)

1639
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,920
My goodness.

1640
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,460
(Out of breath)

1641
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,860
- Goodness.
- Let's keep going.

1642
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,330
This is exhausting.

1643
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,700
(When everybody is about
to get exhausted...)

1644
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,200
You can take a break here. Hurry up.

1645
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,870
We're taking a break here.

1646
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,080
(It's time for a short break.)

1647
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,950
Goodness, it's so nice here.

1648
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:03,990
The view is amazing.

1649
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,050
(The view is fantastic.)

1650
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,720
I think the view here is so good
with this weather.

1651
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,390
You ended up here
because I'm a lucky man.

1652
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,290
Thanks to me.

1653
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:13,390
That view is incredible.

1654
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,400
(I love it.)

1655
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,800
What is this? Fog?

1656
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:17,670
Yes, it's fog.

1657
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,940
(The spectacular view of the fog
that rewards the climb)

1658
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:22,970
Let's go.

1659
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:24,670
- Let's go.
- We took a good break.

1660
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:25,710
(On their way to Baekrok Spring again
after taking a break)

1661
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,980
The view from here is spectacular.

1662
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,810
It's amazing. Goodness.

1663
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:32,410
It's unbelievable.

1664
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,280
I can't see it properly,
but it still is cool.

1665
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,250
The vibe is amazing.

1666
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,850
(The vibe is rather dreamy
thanks to the fog.)

1667
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,890
(But it suddenly starts to rain hard
after their break.)

1668
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,600
(They can't even open their eyes
due to heavy wind.)

1669
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,330
My hat will fly away.

1670
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:54,200
(The wind is so heavy
that his hat almost got flown away.)

1671
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:59,970
I want to go back!

1672
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,110
(Flopping down)

1673
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,750
(Where is this place? Who am I?)

1674
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,550
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

1675
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:11,350
Please say something hopeful.

1676
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,190
Maybe, "We are almost there."

1677
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,490
Let's go!

1678
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,260
He surely is a Type T.

1679
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,290
(Mr. Kim is Type T for sure.)

1680
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:19,490
He is a Type T.

1681
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,400
(They're still at Byeongpung Rocks.)

1682
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,400
(They're almost done climbing up
the tough course.)

1683
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,040
My goodness, the wind.

1684
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,410
(But the storm gets even heavier
as they go up.)

1685
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:33,910
(Swaying)

1686
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:40,620
(He can't even open his eyes.)

1687
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,120
My face is burning.

1688
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,120
(The storm is so heavy
that even his face is burning.)

1689
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,220
Goodness, what is this?

1690
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,650
(Se Yoon's cameraman swaying)

1691
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,360
- I think I'll get blown away.
- I know.

1692
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,120
- I think I'll get blown away.
- Me too.

1693
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,460
(It's so hard to see
Baekrok Spring.)

1694
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:00,900
(Se Yoon stops for a moment.)

1695
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,500
Hello.

1696
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,810
(Suddenly?)

1697
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:05,040
I'm the entertainer
with the spirit of a bear,

1698
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,210
Moon Grylls, not Bear Grylls.

1699
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,850
I think we're at an altitude
of about 1,500m.

1700
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,610
There's a promise
I made with Seon Ho yesterday.

1701
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:17,090
I'm really tired, Seon Ho.

1702
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,050
I'll eat this now. Thanks.

1703
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,490
It's warm since I just caught it.

1704
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:29,000
(Moon Grylls toughly tears it
and eats it.)

1705
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,160
I won't give up.

1706
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:31,870
My body may be fat,

1707
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,670
but in my heart, I'm muscular.

1708
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,670
Let's walk.

1709
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,070
Goodness.

1710
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,780
(Moon Grylls stops
after about 5 seconds.)

1711
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,520
The medicine isn't working.

1712
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,620
It's not working at all.

1713
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:53,990
I'm so tired.

1714
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:55,960
I just hope it starts working later.

1715
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,430
(Moon Grylls, the end)

1716
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:03,660
(Meanwhile, at the base camp)

1717
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:06,800
(It's not rainy or windy.)

1718
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:11,340
(They're going in
to wake up Team Dolphin.)

1719
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,370
Good morning.

1720
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,580
(He's startled.)

1721
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:20,310
(Forced wake-up)

1722
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,450
Wake up.

1723
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,350
What is it?

1724
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,790
(Is this a dream?)

1725
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,360
It's time for the adventure.

1726
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:32,130
(He attacks
by turning on the lights.)

1727
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:33,230
What?

1728
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,200
It's 8:30 a.m. now.

1729
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:36,930
We'll go and have breakfast.

1730
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,000
Let's eat.

1731
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:40,400
Let's go.

1732
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,810
It's a proper meal.

1733
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:44,840
Right.

1734
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,870
We're having a proper meal
after two days.

1735
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,650
I found the picture
I talked about yesterday.

1736
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,080
- Did you find it?
- Yes, I found it.

1737
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:55,250
I went to a tent bar,

1738
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:56,720
and I found dolphins.

1739
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,450
- It's true.
- It's amazing, right?

1740
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:00,660
I think the name was
Indo-Pacific dolly.

1741
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,160
Indo-Pacific dolly?

1742
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,830
It's called
the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin.

1743
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,400
Do you think the other team
had breakfast?

1744
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,500
They were telling them to go eat
when I woke up at 6:30 a.m.

1745
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,140
- I heard that too.
- Right.

1746
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,170
They'd have mixed feelings.

1747
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:18,410
(They'd be struggling.)

1748
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,980
You'll be telling us
what we'll ride...

1749
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:23,210
to see the dolphins in a while.

1750
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,780
We'll probably take a boat.

1751
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,610
- A boat.
- I think so too.

1752
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,850
We'll ride motorcycles
to see the dolphins?

1753
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,390
To see the dolphins?

1754
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:32,920
(We'll take the scooter today.)

1755
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,390
We'll get on the scooters...

1756
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:37,460
and head out
for a dolphin adventure.

1757
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:40,830
The Indo-Pacific bottleneck dolphins
of the sea in Jeju...

1758
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,600
mainly live in the sea...

1759
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,070
off Noeulhaean-ro in Daejeong-eup.

1760
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:49,170
When you meet
the lucky dolphins today,

1761
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,910
you should take a picture
and send it to us.

1762
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,540
When we get the pictures,

1763
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,680
your Jeju adventure will end
immediately.

1764
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,410
(The older members
are already excited.)

1765
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:59,750
- Let's do well.
- We'll ride motorcycles...

1766
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,980
We'll ride motorcycles and see them?

1767
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,950
We'll ride motorcycles
along the beach.

1768
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:06,190
They move in packs.

1769
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:07,490
- We'll be able to see them.
- Let's go.

1770
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:09,290
- Dolphin, dolphin, yes!
- Dolphin, dolphin, yes!

1771
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:10,790
Isn't it childish?

1772
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,560
- "Dolphin, dolphin, yes?"
- Right.

1773
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,230
(The last Jeju expedition)

1774
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:21,170
(Find the Indo-Pacific
bottleneck dolphins!)

1775
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,240
Shall we all set off
to find the dolphins?

1776
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,810
Let's go!

1777
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,540
We'll let you go home quickly.

1778
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:29,810
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1779
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,150
(Heading out to find the dolphins)

1780
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:32,150
Let's go!

1781
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:35,580
Keep a safe distance.

1782
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:37,920
Let's be careful.
We shouldn't get hurt.

1783
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:40,620
We should keep going
at the speed of 40km per hour.

1784
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,920
- Yes.
- Let's go to their home.

1785
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,920
Okay.

1786
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,760
You have to lead well, Sae Ho.

1787
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,790
Okay.

1788
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:49,560
We're on a Jeju trip together
while feeling the breeze.

1789
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,930
We turn right here.

1790
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:55,240
(They follow navigator Sae Ho.)

1791
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:59,070
I think we'll see them here.

1792
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,980
Gosh.

1793
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,150
This is amazing.

1794
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:05,910
It's awesome. It's so beautiful.

1795
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:08,750
(They're on a beachside road
with an open view.)

1796
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:12,650
The dolphins swim...

1797
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:14,120
near the beach.

1798
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,290
- Right.
- They don't swim far.

1799
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,760
The sea on the left is so pretty.

1800
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,600
- It's amazing.
- This is nice.

1801
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,460
It's beautiful.

1802
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,230
This is the charm of Jeju.

1803
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:25,900
This is Jeju.

1804
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,240
(It was Jeju.)

1805
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,400
This is Jeju.

1806
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,470
You can look at the sea
while riding along the coast.

1807
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,070
You can see the Indo-Pacific dolly.

1808
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,740
Should we watch them
from the left...

1809
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,710
- with a wider view?
- The left.

1810
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,450
The left.

1811
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:42,480
This side is good.
It's easy to park too.

1812
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,550
Okay.

1813
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,190
Gosh. This is it.

1814
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:50,120
(There are dolphins
somewhere in the vast ocean.)

1815
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,390
It's so nice.

1816
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:53,090
(There are dolphins
somewhere in the vast ocean.)

1817
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,930
We have to hold our phones.
We never know when they'll come.

1818
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,700
Look through the binoculars.
You can see so clearly.

1819
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:03,100
(They use an item to search.)

1820
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,770
- You can see it well.
- Right?

1821
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:08,080
I think they'd be there.

1822
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:09,380
Somewhere, right?

1823
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:12,080
(Glancing)

1824
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,450
You startled me.

1825
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:15,680
(He saw something else
instead of the dolphins.)

1826
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,090
(They keep searching
for the dolphins.)

1827
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,750
Do you not see them?

1828
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,120
I don't think they're around.

1829
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:23,460
It's not easy to find them.

1830
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,990
I think we'll have to
travel some more.

1831
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:26,860
They're not here?

1832
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:27,960
(The view is great,
but there are no dolphins.)

1833
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,500
Let's move after taking a picture.

1834
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,500
Let's do that.

1835
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,400
Let's go to their house.

1836
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:34,200
If they're not home,

1837
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,500
- we can go to their friend's house.
- Right.

1838
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,340
They should meet their friends
since it's a weekend.

1839
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,540
(The dolphins should also
meet their friends.)

1840
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,010
One, two, three.

1841
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:44,010
- Yes!
- Let's go!

1842
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:45,310
- Let's go.
- Yes!

1843
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:46,310
(You must take pictures
on an expedition.)

1844
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,620
Let's go!

1845
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:51,420
You have to look to the left at times.
The dolphins may come out.

1846
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:54,160
Dolphins! On the left.

1847
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,390
(Did he find one right away?)

1848
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:56,420
A statue.

1849
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,630
How are you doing, statue?

1850
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,860
Left!

1851
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,100
The view on the left is great.

1852
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,400
That spot is nice.

1853
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:06,770
Let's pull over on the left.

1854
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,200
We'll see the dolphins
if we look closely.

1855
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,470
Let's go down to the left.

1856
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,180
(Please!)

1857
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,580
Go to the front.

1858
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:18,510
Right.

1859
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,720
We'll find the dolphins here.

1860
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,650
I think we'll see them here.
I have a good feeling.

1861
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:26,220
Come out!

1862
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,060
Dolphins!

1863
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,430
(Did he find something?)

1864
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:33,730
What?

1865
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,460
No.

1866
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,500
(It's a water bird.)

1867
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:41,770
(They start getting worried.)

1868
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:43,800
Talk to them in a high tone.

1869
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,510
I see them!

1870
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,810
They're there!

1871
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:48,310
Let me see.

1872
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:50,080
- They're right there.
- Where? Let me have it.

1873
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,410
There.

1874
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,710
Where?

1875
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:56,120
- Hold on.
- The buoy?

1876
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:58,290
No. Where did it go?

1877
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:00,290
The fin went up and down.

1878
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:03,020
- I think that was a buoy.
- No.

1879
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,060
It looked so much like a fin.

1880
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,930
I don't think they're here now.

1881
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,830
Let's go.

1882
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:11,630
Seon Ho might have seen them.

1883
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:17,100
(Seon Ho can't leave
the breakwater so easily.)

1884
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:21,240
(What did Seon Ho see?)

1885
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,110
We're in trouble.

1886
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:24,980
(Will they be able to see
the dolphins at the next spot?)

1887
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,880
We have very poor visibility.

1888
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,750
It's very foggy.

1889
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,020
We can't find the dolphins.

1890
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,590
They also wouldn't come so close.

1891
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:38,930
(They can't see the road
so clearly.)

1892
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,060
(The production crew makes
an urgent decision...)

1893
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:43,160
(to find the dolphins.)

1894
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,900
(They distributed cameras...)

1895
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,000
(at the locations
where they saw the dolphins...)

1896
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,340
(during their previous search.)

1897
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:53,570
(Location 1: Bbulsora Park)

1898
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:58,110
(It's a famous location
for seeing dolphins.)

1899
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:01,750
(Travelers visiting Jeju
often wait here.)

1900
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:04,550
The wind...

1901
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:09,460
(The weather condition
is bad today.)

1902
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:12,430
(Hint them if there are dolphins.
It'll be hard to see anything.)

1903
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:13,430
(A text that
the production crew sent.)

1904
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:15,930
(Team Bbulsora arrived,
and we can see only 50m ahead...)

1905
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:16,930
(because of the fog.)

1906
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:20,400
(Location 2: Ilgwa 2-ri
Fishing Village Association)

1907
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,940
The weather is bad.

1908
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,070
(They're struggling
with the wind here as well.)

1909
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:27,510
(Location 3: Yeongnak-ri Breakwater
that the members dropped by)

1910
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:29,140
The weather...

1911
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,810
(No one took pictures yet, right?
I don't think we'll be going home!)

1912
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:32,280
(All they see are the strong waves.)

1913
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,810
(They're not at the breakwater.)

1914
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:36,220
Will we really not go home?

1915
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:41,520
- I think we should move.
- They're not here?

1916
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,960
Let's take a picture and move.

1917
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,960
Okay.

1918
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,760
I think we'll have to go further.

1919
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,400
The visibility is really bad.
I can't see.

1920
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,130
This...

1921
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:51,900
Today...

1922
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,270
(Will they fail the mission today?)

1923
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:56,640
Will we be able to see them?
We can't see far ahead.

1924
01:08:57,170 --> 01:09:00,510
(The scooters of the three
pace through the frustration.)

1925
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:03,040
(At these times...)

1926
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,780
Should we go to a cafe
and try spotting them...

1927
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:05,850
with a cup of coffee?

1928
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,050
Okay. Let's do that.

1929
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:09,080
(Haste makes waste.)

1930
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,290
If there's a nice cafe,

1931
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:16,020
we should have
a cup of coffee, latte, or tea.

1932
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,560
- Sounds good.
- Sounds good.

1933
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,160
There's a cafe here.

1934
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:21,760
I think it'll be nice.

1935
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:23,560
It's open.

1936
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,670
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1937
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,840
We'll just go to any place
we see like this.

1938
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:29,700
This is what
free traveling is about.

1939
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,670
Let's go for the vibes.

1940
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,710
(How is Team Baekrok Spring doing?)

1941
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:39,110
(The rainstorm seems to
know no end,)

1942
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:43,220
(and the journey to
Baekrok Spring continues.)

1943
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,450
(His cheeks get pushed in.)

1944
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,290
Gosh, that stings.

1945
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:54,760
(The rain slams down
against their faces.)

1946
01:09:56,130 --> 01:10:00,170
(The members are getting exhausted.)

1947
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,700
- Enjoy.
- Cheers!

1948
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,140
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1949
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:05,940
Gosh, the coffee is good.

1950
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:07,880
The coffee is so good.

1951
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,750
(Team Baekrok Spring is hiking
in extreme conditions.)

1952
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,320
(They have passed
the Byeongpung Rocks.)

1953
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,250
(The decide to take a break
at the end of the difficult course.)

1954
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,020
Gosh, the wind...

1955
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,430
I've never felt a wind this strong.

1956
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,260
Gosh.

1957
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:28,430
My eardrums hurt.

1958
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,760
Right.

1959
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,230
(Getting energized with sugar
during the break)

1960
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,370
(Moon Grylls arrives
after going through the rainstorm.)

1961
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:41,210
(In tatters)

1962
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,580
Gosh, it's the cool guy.

1963
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:44,580
(You've gone through so much.)

1964
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:47,110
Have a chocolate bar.

1965
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:49,380
Have a chocolate bar.

1966
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,150
Have some. No?

1967
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:52,390
(He lost his appetite
with the arduous hike.)

1968
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,020
Let's go.

1969
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:55,760
- Let's go. It's cold.
- Let's go.

1970
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:58,260
- Do you want to take the lead?
- Okay.

1971
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:00,430
(Current location)

1972
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:03,260
(The path is flat
starting from now.)

1973
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,600
It's much easier now.
There are trees too.

1974
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:09,140
That part was really tough.

1975
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,640
Right. It was really tough.

1976
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,810
- Gosh, the wind...
- Now,

1977
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,440
you can enjoy the view, right?

1978
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,240
- Gosh.
- Will you take a look at this?

1979
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,010
This tree.

1980
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:19,380
- Gosh.
- It's pretty.

1981
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,850
This is the Korean fir,
which is used as a Christmas tree.

1982
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:24,150
I can tell right away.

1983
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:25,190
(The original Christmas tree,
Korean fir)

1984
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,890
(It's an endemic species
in Korea...)

1985
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:29,390
(that grows in alpine regions...)

1986
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:31,260
(and blossoms flowers of
several colors in May and June.)

1987
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:36,200
(The Korean fir grove
unfolds from this point.)

1988
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,500
Gosh, it's so pretty.

1989
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:42,440
The trees are precious.

1990
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,710
They block the rain and wind for us.

1991
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,910
Right.

1992
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:51,150
(They take in the view
of Mount Halla thanks to the trees.)

1993
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:53,580
- Gosh, there are young ones here.
- Hello.

1994
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:54,680
- They're celebrities!
- Move down safely.

1995
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,950
- Gosh.
- It's 2 Days and 1 Night!

1996
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,320
Move down safely, ma'am!

1997
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,460
You're amazing!

1998
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,590
- She's amazing.
- I'm dying right now!

1999
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,390
You're amazing!

2000
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:07,590
2 Days!

2001
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,600
- 2 Days!
- And 1 Night!

2002
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,400
It became 2 Days 2 Days and 1 Night.

2003
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,430
Thank you!

2004
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,870
(A vast grassland unfolds
after passing the Korean fir grove.)

2005
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:20,340
(This place is Seonjakjiwat.)

2006
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,480
Why are we stopping here?

2007
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:28,980
- This is Nolu Spring.
- Nolu Spring?

2008
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:32,490
This place has drinking water
at the highest altitude...

2009
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:34,490
- in our country.
- Really?

2010
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:36,420
This is the source...

2011
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:37,860
of Jeju's famous water brand.

2012
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,630
- Let's have some!
- Really? It's from this place?

2013
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:40,730
- Gosh!
- Let's have some!

2014
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:41,760
Give it a try.

2015
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,300
(Drinking)

2016
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,130
Does it taste good?

2017
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:48,500
Gosh.

2018
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:49,670
How is it?

2019
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,070
It tastes a bit different.

2020
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:53,110
It's a bit different
from regular water.

2021
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:56,440
These must be fine against the wind.

2022
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:58,150
Gosh!

2023
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,350
- It's a bit sweet.
- Gosh, it's refreshing!

2024
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:01,350
Is it good?

2025
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:02,380
- It's so nice.
- Thank you.

2026
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,280
It tastes a bit like acacia.

2027
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,050
It's so clean.

2028
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:07,790
- It's a very clean taste.
- Right.

2029
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:09,760
It has the sweetness of acacia.

2030
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,130
So this is Jeju water.

2031
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:13,360
(The true taste of Jeju water)

2032
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:15,560
Gosh, that's refreshing.

2033
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,860
It can't be collected, though.

2034
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:20,200
We drank the spring water
of Mount Halla.

2035
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,700
- Gosh.
- This is amazing.

2036
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:24,140
We drank water that's 1,650m high.

2037
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:25,510
- Gosh.
- This is amazing.

2038
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,410
I'll see you in my next life,
Nolu Spring.

2039
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:32,180
(Current location)

2040
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:35,080
(They are around 10 minutes away
from the shelter.)

2041
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:37,320
Gosh, the winds are so harsh.

2042
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,850
(The winds are still strong.)

2043
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,860
I think we should hurry
as it's cold.

2044
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,790
(Even the camera lens gets fogged up
and wet with rainwater.)

2045
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:47,230
It should die down a bit.

2046
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:55,100
(After walking
for around 10 minutes...)

2047
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:58,610
Is that the shelter?

2048
01:13:58,610 --> 01:13:59,840
- Yes.
- Gosh.

2049
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:03,040
(They spot a place with a roof
after hiking for 2 hours.)

2050
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,110
I feel so happy to see it.

2051
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:06,810
What is this place?

2052
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:09,550
(The Witse Oreum shelter is placed
1,700m above ground.)

2053
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:11,080
Let's rest up.

2054
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:12,390
Gosh, it's cold.

2055
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:16,190
(Let's take a break
in the warm shelter.)

2056
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,930
Gosh, hiking is fun!

2057
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:21,300
(Touched)

2058
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,700
Gosh, it's so cold.

2059
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:24,300
My goodness.

2060
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:25,730
Gosh, it's so cozy.

2061
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,500
Gosh, it's cold.

2062
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:29,200
Come here. The heater is here.

2063
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:33,510
(Happy)

2064
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:36,680
(Joon shakes the water
off of his hair.)

2065
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,580
(DinDin shakes the water
off of his pants.)

2066
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:45,490
(Se Yoon has just been shaken up.)

2067
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,360
I thought just the first hour
was going to be tough.

2068
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,530
How could you say that?

2069
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,730
I was told just the first hour
was going to be tough.

2070
01:14:57,730 --> 01:14:58,730
(We'll take a break
as we're too exhausted.)

2071
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:00,330
Is my phone safe with me?

2072
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,100
(Joon has more chocolate.)

2073
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,200
Gosh.

2074
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,070
(He checks how he looks right now.)

2075
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,540
I think I've lost
all of my chubbiness.

2076
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,940
Aren't I like Joon?

2077
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,850
- Gosh.
- You really lost weight!

2078
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:16,620
To me, it feels like
I'm just like you right now.

2079
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,990
Gosh, Mount Halla
is the best plastic surgery clinic.

2080
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:22,090
(We'll let the viewers decide.)

2081
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:24,760
(He makes a video call
to Team Dolphin.)

2082
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,560
- What?
- What?

2083
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,600
- What?
- What?

2084
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,730
What's wrong with your eyes?

2085
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:32,770
(Sae Ho gets flustered for real
after seeing Se Yoon.)

2086
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:33,800
What's wrong?

2087
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,600
(The shocking face appears.)

2088
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,070
What are you saying? I look great
after losing weight right now.

2089
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:42,480
What happened to you?

2090
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,180
Why are your dark circles so big?

2091
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:46,350
I almost died.

2092
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:48,250
- How was it, Joon?
- Are you done?

2093
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:50,250
We came up 1,600m.

2094
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:53,190
- Pass the phone to DinDin.
- That must've been tough.

2095
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:55,490
- We came up 1,600m.
- Right.

2096
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,590
We came up 1,600m.

2097
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,060
Gosh, that's impressive.

2098
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,730
- How high up are you?
- That was fairly quick.

2099
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:03,430
We came up 1,600m.

2100
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,970
Did it take around two hours?

2101
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,470
Longer than that.

2102
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:10,740
The winds were so strong.

2103
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,940
They're strong enough
to make people waver around.

2104
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,580
- Really?
- That was the tough part.

2105
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,780
You and Joon look fine.

2106
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:18,950
What's wrong with Se Yoon?

2107
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:22,320
- Se Yoon looks better.
- His face melted.

2108
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,350
(Se Yoon's face seems like
it got melted.)

2109
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,720
- He lost weight.
- Did someone punch you in the eye?

2110
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:27,190
Did he get stung by a bee?

2111
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:30,090
No. Everyone is going wild
as I look much better.

2112
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:31,790
Nobody is going wild.

2113
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:33,560
That must've been tough.

2114
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,800
- You guys will become healthier.
- Right.

2115
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,100
If you don't believe us,

2116
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,000
watch this week's episode
to see what we went through.

2117
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:40,470
Okay.

2118
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:42,200
Gosh, Se Yoon looks like
he's really struggling.

2119
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,870
But he said
he looks better like that.

2120
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:46,610
(But he said
he looks better like that.)

2121
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:51,140
Everyone,
there's delicious food in the bag.

2122
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,810
- What?
- You can have it.

2123
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,380
- In our bags?
- Yes.

2124
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:56,020
I didn't see anything in my bag.

2125
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:57,080
Joon's bag.

2126
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:59,490
There.

2127
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:00,820
(Food is found in Joon's bag.)

2128
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,920
This is kimchi stew.

2129
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,390
- What is that?
- It's a combat ration.

2130
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:06,930
- Really?
- It's made the same way.

2131
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,530
(Drinking water just needs
to be added.)

2132
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:12,200
What next after that?

2133
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,800
- It's boiling.
- Really?

2134
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,670
It's hot.

2135
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:17,400
(The combat ration boils up
with the heating pack.)

2136
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:21,580
(Ramyeon is made easily
in just 10 minutes.)

2137
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,480
It has cooked well.

2138
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,680
Ramyeon after a hike? This is great.

2139
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:33,650
(Slurping)

2140
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:35,490
It tastes great.

2141
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:39,590
(Baekrok Spring must be enjoyed
after a good meal.)

2142
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:46,870
In the future,

2143
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:48,800
we should put together
a special episode.

2144
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,670
We should climb up K2
or Mount Everest.

2145
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:52,070
(Joon dreams about K2
and Mount Everest after today.)

2146
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:54,270
Just start your own channel!

2147
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:57,080
Just do it on your own.

2148
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,210
You had to see your face
when you hid behind the tree.

2149
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,350
I thought that you were going to
step down from our show.

2150
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,220
(Mount Everest
with a face like this?)

2151
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:06,490
Really?

2152
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,760
Wasn't Mount Halla okay?

2153
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:11,320
It's fine now as we're inside.

2154
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,360
Right.

2155
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:15,830
I think it'll be meaningful
to climb up a significant mountain.

2156
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:16,830
(Will they be able to maintain
this energy to Baekrok Spring?)

2157
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:19,900
Let's go! Let's head out to a place
with a good view.

2158
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,170
We have to see them.

2159
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,570
We'll see them now.

2160
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,670
(Peeking)

2161
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:26,410
The dolphins might appear
all of a sudden!

2162
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,470
Okay.

2163
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,880
(Always be alert.)

2164
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,980
(Peeking)

2165
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:35,480
I think we'll see them around here
if we stand and watch.

2166
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,480
Definitely.

2167
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:38,550
We did stop to see them here.

2168
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:39,890
Should we go further?

2169
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:41,560
Hold on.

2170
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,260
I'm getting a feeling.

2171
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,090
- Okay. Let's keep going.
- Let's keep going.

2172
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:48,930
I have a feeling it'd appear here.

2173
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:49,960
Okay.

2174
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,330
(Staring)

2175
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:54,800
Wait.

2176
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:56,640
- Wait.
- What is it?

2177
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,710
I see it.

2178
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:00,840
(Did he find a dolphin?)

2179
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:03,540
(Is there a dolphin?)

2180
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:05,710
Where?

2181
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,110
Where?

2182
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:08,980
Pull over. Let's check.

2183
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,820
What? Is it here? What?

2184
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,190
Where?

2185
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:13,350
(They went around for 2 hours
to find dolphins.)

2186
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:14,390
Where?

2187
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:15,560
(Looking around)

2188
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:18,930
(I swear I saw it.)

2189
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:24,130
(Will they get to see it today?)

2190
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:25,530
There it is.

2191
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:29,500
(Seon Ho found the dolphin.)

2192
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,800
Where?

2193
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:31,940
I see it.

2194
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:33,010
Where?

2195
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:34,710
Take a picture first.

2196
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:36,010
(Yelling)

2197
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:38,080
(Let me see.)

2198
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,410
Hey. I see it.

2199
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:42,750
(Did they finally succeed
in finding the dolphin?)

2200
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:44,520
- Where is it?
- Where did it go?

2201
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:46,520
I saw it coming up to the surface.

2202
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,120
Where did it go?

2203
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,190
- Does it dive for a long time?
- Do you want to keep going?

2204
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:51,960
There it is. I see it.

2205
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,730
- Where?
- It's moving. Do you see it?

2206
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
There it is.

2207
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,230
Where? Where is it?

2208
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:00,100
Over there. It's moving down.

2209
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,400
Let's go. Let's keep going.

2210
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,440
Let's keep going.

2211
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:06,270
- Let's get closer to it and see it.
- Let's go.

2212
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:08,180
- Where are you going?
- It's here. Where are you going?

2213
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:10,080
If I go further,
I'll get to see it moving.

2214
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,980
- Right. Let's go.
- Let's go.

2215
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:12,980
Okay.

2216
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:14,980
It's moving this way.

2217
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:17,020
I think it's moving up.

2218
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,520
If we stand by up there,

2219
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:22,020
we'll be able to see them.

2220
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:23,820
- Right?
- We can take a picture there.

2221
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,360
Okay. I'll pull over there.

2222
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,230
We'll get a good view from here.

2223
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:29,100
- Over here. This is nice.
- Here?

2224
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,630
- Stop here?
- This is a good spot.

2225
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,300
If I miss it because of you, Sae Ho,

2226
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:34,100
- I'm going to get mad at you.
- No.

2227
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:37,740
(They must find it.)

2228
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:40,640
There it is.

2229
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,110
There.

2230
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:44,880
See? I told you. They didn't leave.

2231
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,150
Over there.

2232
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:48,850
See? I told you. They didn't leave.

2233
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:50,920
I see it.

2234
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,390
I can see it clearly.

2235
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:54,520
Where? I see it.

2236
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:57,060
Gosh.

2237
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:01,760
It's out. There it is.

2238
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,830
- Where?
- Over there.

2239
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:05,200
I can see it clearly.

2240
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,130
(Peekaboo)

2241
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:09,900
I see it.

2242
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:11,400
This is crazy.

2243
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,340
I saw them real good. There it is.

2244
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:14,610
It's huge.

2245
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:17,580
- I can see them well.
- And there are many.

2246
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:18,750
There are many.

2247
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,780
You can see them with the naked eye.

2248
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:22,920
(A school of dolphins
swimming across the Jeju sea)

2249
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:26,620
There are so many.

2250
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,760
- Amazing.
- It's terrific.

2251
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,760
They're pretty close, right?

2252
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,190
(And...)

2253
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:36,530
(News of dolphin spottings
here and there)

2254
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,400
- I caught them.
- I see them.

2255
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:46,410
- Here.
- Where?

2256
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:48,780
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

2257
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,840
There.

2258
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,980
(The fin fighting against the waves)

2259
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,750
- There.
- I see it.

2260
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:55,150
The fin.

2261
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,120
- Oh, my gosh. I found the dolphin.
- That's awesome.

2262
01:21:58,350 --> 01:21:59,850
I found it.

2263
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:02,060
Is it coming this way?

2264
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:04,520
(If you wait...)

2265
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,230
Where did it go?

2266
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:08,330
It's moving this way.

2267
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,460
This is awesome.

2268
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,670
Aren't you amazed
to see the dolphin?

2269
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,240
What? Yes.

2270
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,840
(A total of 25 years of experience
behind the camera)

2271
01:22:45,530 --> 01:22:46,830
(A strong jump)

2272
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:48,170
They're jumping.

2273
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:50,340
I filmed like ten.

2274
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,310
I'm getting more. There are more.

2275
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:57,040
(Interacting with nature)

2276
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,610
There are so many.

2277
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:00,710
This is crazy.
I can see them so clearly.

2278
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:01,750
This is the spot.

2279
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,520
This place is perfect
for seeing dolphins.

2280
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:05,290
Gosh.

2281
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:07,090
(People gathered.)

2282
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,890
It jumped.

2283
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:10,890
Isn't it amazing?

2284
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:11,960
(Watching the piece of art together)

2285
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,690
- This is a rare sight.
- Yes.

2286
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:16,930
Gosh. I can see their bodies too.

2287
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:18,630
This is art.

2288
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:20,800
Gosh.

2289
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:24,470
(As if they knew
we were waiting for them...)

2290
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:26,210
- There are so many.
- Gosh.

2291
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:28,540
This is perfect. It was a good idea
to listen to Sae Ho.

2292
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,280
We can get a better view here.

2293
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:32,150
What are they doing?

2294
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:33,850
This is so exciting.

2295
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:35,150
This is unbelievable.

2296
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:37,450
This is perfect.
I can see them clearly.

2297
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,820
(You should check them out
when you visit Jeju.)

2298
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:41,450
This place is perfect.

2299
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:42,520
(Exclaiming)

2300
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,820
I caught them all.

2301
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:46,190
- Gosh.
- That is...

2302
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,560
I caught many of them.

2303
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,100
A dolphin.

2304
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,800
(Sae Ho's camera)

2305
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,600
I caught them clearly.

2306
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,400
- Do you see them?
- Let me see.

2307
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:56,670
That's perfect.

2308
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:58,270
I caught them clearly.

2309
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:00,510
Well done.

2310
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:02,480
Since you found the dolphins,

2311
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,740
it's the end
of your Jeju exploration.

2312
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:06,680
Thank you.

2313
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,150
(The dolphin exploration
is a success.)

2314
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:10,220
- It feels nice.
- It's nice.

2315
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:14,690
(We're happy for you.)

2316
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,120
- Is this my stick?
- Yes.

2317
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,290
Okay.

2318
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:19,330
(Team Baekrok Spring's journey
is nearing its end.)

2319
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:21,560
Go.

2320
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:25,500
(DinDin and Joon are ready.)

2321
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:28,770
It's cold.

2322
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,500
(The rainstorm welcomes him
as soon as he's out.)

2323
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:34,810
(Rushing because it's cold)

2324
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:35,840
Let's go.

2325
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,180
(Off to Baekrok Spring again
after warming up)

2326
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,450
Thank you.

2327
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:40,310
Is it windy at Baekrok Spring?

2328
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:42,280
Yes. It is open.

2329
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,820
It's cold, even though it's summer.

2330
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,320
It's freezing.

2331
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,290
Gosh.

2332
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:53,730
I'm dying.

2333
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:57,330
(15 minutes to their destination)

2334
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,670
I don't normally say it's cold.

2335
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,300
I never thought...

2336
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,010
I'd say it's cold in summer.

2337
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:08,910
I can't believe this is happening.

2338
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:11,080
(Raining Mount Halla in summer
is colder than winter training.)

2339
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:12,610
What? Are we going down?

2340
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:16,280
Does it mean we have to go up again?

2341
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,620
My goodness.

2342
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:21,520
I want to stop going up.

2343
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:24,860
(It's a repetition
of downhills and uphills.)

2344
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:28,230
(A rough journey
to meet Baekrok Spring)

2345
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:34,100
(This is
a real and wild road variety show.)

2346
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:44,480
(They run out of strength
as they reach the peak.)

2347
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:48,150
(A crazy collaboration...)

2348
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:52,420
(between the endless uphills
and the fierce rainstorm)

2349
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:57,920
(The wind gets stronger
as they go higher.)

2350
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,130
We're almost there.

2351
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:05,730
(Their destination is near.)

2352
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:07,730
We're entering now.

2353
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:08,800
Okay.

2354
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,970
I think we're here.

2355
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:16,580
(Ragged)

2356
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:18,310
Is this the way?

2357
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:22,320
This place hasn't been
disturbed yet.

2358
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:27,090
(Finally)

2359
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,520
- Do we go this way?
- We have to keep going.

2360
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,230
(They must take the byway
to reach the spring.)

2361
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:33,790
- Here?
- Yes.

2362
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,830
Let me present you
the best secret sight.

2363
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:38,260
- Do we go this way?
- Good work.

2364
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:41,070
But this isn't a path.

2365
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:42,340
(The members step on the land...)

2366
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:44,300
(that has never been opened
to the public before.)

2367
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,640
I barely passed it.

2368
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:50,080
There is no path to it.

2369
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:52,510
- What?
- There is no path to it.

2370
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:53,880
Right, there's no path.

2371
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:54,910
(Walking the real wild road)

2372
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,780
This is awesome.

2373
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:58,890
- Yes.
- It's the real wild.

2374
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:01,890
We're like a fellowship.

2375
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:03,290
(1 Night Expedition is as tough
as the fellowship of the ring.)

2376
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:04,920
This is almost like
"The Lord of the Rings."

2377
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,430
This is the best exploration.

2378
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:10,430
(The last-minute rainstorm attack)

2379
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:15,370
(Baekrok Spring is
at the end of this road.)

2380
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:17,100
This way.

2381
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,370
(It's time to meet the treasure.)

2382
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:22,510
That's Baekrok Spring.

2383
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:25,240
(That's Baekrok Spring.)

2384
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,580
Is this Baekrok Spring?

2385
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:28,880
- Yes, it's Baekrok Spring.
- Here?

2386
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,650
You climbed for two hours...

2387
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:34,120
- for this.
- That's right.

2388
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:37,960
(They've only seen pictures
of Baekrok Spring.)

2389
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:41,630
(It's right before their eyes.)

2390
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:46,370
(The highest spring in the country,
Baekrok Spring)

2391
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:49,440
It was hard.
Let me take a picture of it.

2392
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:51,240
Finally.

2393
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:54,040
It was hard.
Let me take a picture of it.

2394
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,840
Baekrok Spring, to see you...

2395
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:00,580
Oh, Baekrok Spring.

2396
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:02,780
Why do you live so far?

2397
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,320
When the weather is clear,

2398
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,790
you can see Lake Baengnok...

2399
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,960
behind this.

2400
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,820
- Gosh.
- When the weather is nice...

2401
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:16,000
(This is Lake Baengnok.)

2402
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,300
The water from Lake Baengnok...

2403
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:19,830
could reach here.

2404
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:22,140
Is it connected to Lake Baengnok?

2405
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:24,340
There's a possibility.
We don't know for sure.

2406
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:26,970
- The water is really clean.
- It's clean.

2407
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:28,780
It's so clean.

2408
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,980
(Baekrok Spring never dries
throughout the year.)

2409
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:38,180
(Through Jeongbang Waterfall,)

2410
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:42,320

(Baekrok Spring is the lifeline
and water source of Jeju Island.)

01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:50,060
You reached Baekrok Spring.

01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,770
- Along with Joon.
- What are you doing?

2415
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:57,170
(Joon smiles brightly at last.)

2416
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:58,270
Today, again...

2417
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:03,280
I'll take a photo to commemorate
your visit to Baekrok Spring.

2418
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:05,780

A total real wild road.)

2421
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:18,730
We're at Baekrok Spring.

(They saw Baekrok Spring,
the treasure of Mount Halla.)

2429
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:43,250
(It's always exciting
to go down a mountain.)

2430
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:44,650
(Groaning)

2431
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:47,550
How much farther must we go?

2432
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:54,490
(They safely descend the mountain.)

2433
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,600

(Next episode)

2452
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:48,180

01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,130
(Lee Joon always loses.)

2459
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:09,040
(Is he truly a Defeat Fairy?)

2460
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,870
(It's time to find out the truth.)

2461
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:13,070
What's important...

2462
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:15,640
(Who comes 1st isn't important.)

2463
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:18,280
(It's who comes last.)

2464
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,380
