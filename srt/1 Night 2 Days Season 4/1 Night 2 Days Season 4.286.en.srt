1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,240
(Specially today,)

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,480
(we film the opening
in a world of fantasy.)

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,050
(Lots of things to see,)

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,580
(to ride,)

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,790
(and to eat.)

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,160
(Let's go to the world of fantasy.)

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,120
(Unfortunately, however,)

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,100
(it started to rain
early in the morning.)

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,900
You don't have an umbrella?

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,830
- Hey, give him an umbrella.
- He needs one.

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,530
- Just in case.
- Don't try to be funny.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,600
Why don't you have an umbrella?

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,740
- He gave it back.
- Yes.

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,800
- Why?
- He said he didn't need it.

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,440
- He refused it.
- This kind of rain is nice.

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,580
Yes. The weirder Joon is,
the better it is for us.

17
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,940
This feels great.

18
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,750
I just don't get you.

19
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,780
Do you like rain?

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,880
(During his trip
to Sin, Si, and Mo Islands)

21
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,520
I can't be bothered...

22
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,220
(He's mentioned it before.)

23
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,120
(It would be nice
to be in this kind of rain.)

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,060
(He's so consistent.)

25
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,690
I haven't been here in so long.

26
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,730
(It's 8 a.m.,
and the theme park isn't open yet.)

27
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,130
I can find my way
with my eyes closed.

28
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,970
Straight ahead is the store.

29
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,470
There's a zombie village.

30
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,170
A bit further on is the zoo.

31
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,370
Which way to my home?

32
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,910
- To Sangam-dong.
- I don't know the way.

33
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,080
I came here so many times.

34
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,750
We won't ride anything, will we?

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,610
- We can't if it rains.
- No.

36
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,180
- I can't do it.
- That's...

37
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,220
Why think of rides...

38
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,120
- when you can walk?
- Oh, I don't know.

39
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
(Coward number 2)

40
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

41
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,760
- Hello.
- Hi.

42
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,190
Joon doesn't care for umbrellas.

43
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,130
He returned his,
saying he didn't need it.

44
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,000
This kind of rain is a blessing.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,430
- I offered him to share...
- I like it.

46
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,700
I offered to share mine,

47
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,300
and he sternly said, "Go away."

48
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,770
So I said, "Okay. Point taken."

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,640
He lives so close to here...

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,040
that he didn't get his hair done.

51
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,680
- He's that close.
- I see.

52
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,740
- He doesn't fear the rain.
- He can get wet.

53
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,650
It's 2 Days and 1 Night.

54
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,110
But I got here in 20 minutes.

55
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,320
- Does that make sense?
- But...

56
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,380
- It usually takes a few hours.
- You live next door.

57
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,090
- Yes.
- Stay dry.

58
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,320
This is romantic.

59
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,120
Jong Min looks really pleased.

60
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,530
"We can't ride anything if it rains,
right?"

61
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,960
(High hopes)

62
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,160
We can't ride anything.

63
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
That's great.

64
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,500
(It's a welcome rain
to these two who dislike rides.)

65
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,700
We came to Yongin,
which is a popular place...

66
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,570
to visit on the outskirts of Seoul.

67
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,270
- It's lovely.
- This is our destination.

68
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,640
Around this time
is when Sae Ho and Joon...

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,280
- It's their first anniversary?
- joined the group.

70
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,850
- That's right.
- Already?

71
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,920
(One stifling summer day
in August, 2024)

72
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,850
(To change things around
on 2 Days and 1 Night,)

73
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,190
(Sae Ho and Joon joined the family.)

74
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,220
(They underwent a tough hazing.)

75
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,060
(Now they have been with us
for four seasons.)

76
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,060
"So nice?"

77
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,940
(We laughed a lot
during the past year.)

78
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,110
(We are 2 Days and 1 Night.)

79
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,740
(We bring pieces
of our memories together...)

80
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,410
(to complete our own map.)

81
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,720
- Yes.
- Really?

82
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,180
- It has been a year.
- No way.

83
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,450
I made a lot of memories.

84
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,920
A year has passed already.

85
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,760
So today,
to celebrate the anniversary...

86
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,790
- "Goodbye, Cho Sae Ho?"
- To laugh a lot...

87
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,960
Come on.

88
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,760
- Don't be like that.
- For the past year,

89
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,730
I was pleased
to have been on the show.

90
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,470
- He's saying goodbye?
- I'll work even harder.

91
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,440
- Okay.
- No goodbye.

92
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,940
No goodbye.

93
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,010
To celebrate
their first anniversary,

94
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,170
so we can laugh even more...

95
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,040
and win the love of our viewers,

96
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,710
we'll go on Hoya and Joon's...

97
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,610
one-year celebratory trip.

98
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,320
- It's the Grab and Kill Tour.
- "Grab and Kill?"

99
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Grab everything?

100
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,620
- Grab hold.
- What's "Hoya?"

101
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,560
- Cho Sae Hoya.
- I see.

102
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
It's from his name.

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
He mentioned it in the interview.

104
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,560
- He nicknamed himself?
- The crew contacted me.

105
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,700
I can't repeat all that was said,

106
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,430
but I said this and that
for over four hours.

107
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,800
What?

108
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,900
- Four hours?
- The interview?

109
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,300
What?

110
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,770
We stayed on the phone.

111
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,310
- For real?
- My gosh.

112
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,980
Weren't you the only one
to talk so much?

113
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,110
- How long was your interview?
- About 40 minutes?

114
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,210
- Forty minutes?
- Yes.

115
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,250
(Pretending he didn't hear)

116
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,720
He turned a 40-minute thing
into 4 hours?

117
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,550
The phone must've been so hot.

118
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,890
(Embarrassed)

119
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,420
- I don't see her.
- She's gone.

120
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,160
- Why didn't you meet up?
- The phone...

121
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,530
Here's why I came up
with the Hoya and Joon nicknames.

122
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,330
It's our one-year anniversary,

123
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,830
and I wanted a cute-sounding name
that would suit a one-year-old.

124
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,200
- Like a nickname?
- Yes.

125
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,870
I thought that would be nice.

126
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,040
Did your family
call you "Hoya" at home?

127
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,110
My elderly relatives would say,
"Hoya, did you eat?"

128
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,770
They called me that.

129
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,710
I used to be called Hoya too.

130
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,310
- He's Seon Ho.
- Yes.

131
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,340
He's Hoya too.

132
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,980
- It feels...
- Are they from Jeolla Province?

133
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,580
a bit contrived.

134
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,220
How do you feel?
You're making things up.

135
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,850
- No, I didn't make it up.
- You feel okay?

136
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,550
- I made up the four-hour interview.
- Did you?

137
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,690
- Yes.
- That was a lie?

138
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,990
You lied about that?

139
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,360
How long was it, then?

140
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,420
(Why would you make that up?)

141
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,590
It was just 20 minutes?

142
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,300
- It's Joon and Hoya's first year.
- Yes.

143
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,730
And it's been a year
since Hyun took over as director.

144
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,900
- Yes.
- Congratulations!

145
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,770
- It's Hyun's anniversary too.
- Is it really?

146
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,640
- Yes, you're Hyun.
- That's right.

147
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
Hyun.

148
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,810
The name of the tour,
"Grab and Kill Tour,"

149
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,210
came from a comment...

150
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,640
Se Yoon made during the last trip
that touched us all.

151
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,580
- That's where it came from.
- You had an idea?

152
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,110
I didn't, but we have a great crew.

153
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,410
We say random things,

154
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,650
but they pick them up
and turn them into content.

155
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,220
When did I say anything like that?

156
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,450
When did you say that?

157
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,190
For Joon and Sae Ho's
one-year anniversary trip...

158
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,420
- What do we want to do?
- Yes.

159
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,490
Call them Director Cho
and Director Lee...

160
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,500
and announce a new concept
where they just set off.

161
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,970
That could be pretty fun.

162
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,100
It would be amazing.

163
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,900
"Grab and Kill Tour"
where they practically kill us.

164
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,070
Something like that?

165
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,010
We asked Sae Ho and Joon
for a bucket list...

166
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,980
of what they'd like to do
with the members...

167
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,680
on their anniversary trip.

168
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,680
They had lots of good suggestions.

169
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,680
Doesn't Joon want to...

170
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,420
- walk across the country?
- No, I had realistic ideas.

171
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,490
- Ride a duck boat to Japan?
- There's nothing like that.

172
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,990
Today, we'll do things on Sae Ho...

173
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,420
and Joon's one-year anniversary...

174
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,390
bucket list as a group.

175
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,060
- Gosh...
- A bucket list?

176
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,700
Let me say something in advance.

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,030
I chose things that you'd loike...

178
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,630
- What?
- "Loike?"

179
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,670
What do we loike?

180
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,200
- Did you prepare this?
- "Loike."

181
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,600
(Melomashi)

182
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,110
- I chose...
- Was that a dialect?

183
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,310
things that you would like.

184
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,410
- But...
- "Loike."

185
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,680
Did you list things
you really wanted to do...

186
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,110
or add a few things
for entertainment's sake?

187
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,850
Rather than wonder
if it would make a good show,

188
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,280
- I listed what I wanted.
- Really?

189
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,590
That's what I told them.

190
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,520
I'm more worried about
what Joon said.

191
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,760
I'm most worried about him too.

192
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,890
He doesn't even remember.

193
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,660
- I really don't remember.
- Oh, dear.

194
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,400
I think I said things
that would be good for our program.

195
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,630
If things go wrong,

196
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,470
who will be held responsible?

197
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,840
It should be those two.

198
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,070
- Those two?
- Yes.

199
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,010
- If things go wrong?
- Yes.

200
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,110
They quit...

201
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,840
and we air
a goodbye Joon and Sae Ho special.

202
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,210
(Concerned)

203
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,780
- Forget about that.
- Yes.

204
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,780
Didn't you get a message
from the director?

205
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,350
"We'll end late tomorrow."

206
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,990
"Be prepared."

207
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,450
What was your reply?

208
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,420
- "I'll do my best."
- You'll do your best?

209
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,990
"Okay. Good luck this week."

210
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,360
I said, "Can't we stay even longer?"

211
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,830
What?

212
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,460
- Are you serious?
- Is that another lie?

213
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
- Let's see.
- Show us the text.

214
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,600
- Show us.
- Are you serious?

215
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,440
- Let's see it.
- What for?

216
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,140
Why does he keep lying?

217
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,770
Did that do you any harm?

218
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,470
I apologize.

219
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,780
(If it did, I'm sorry.)

220
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,010
Okay. As we did on their first trip,

221
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,980
you'll complete a mission
as a group.

222
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,550
You must buy lunch
with the allowance you win.

223
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,550
That's great.
The food here is good.

224
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,550
- It's good?
- First,

225
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,560
It's good.

226
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Sae Ho...

227
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,190
We'll go
with Hoya's bucket list first.

228
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,230
- Really?
- Yes.

229
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,830
Let's do the usual cheer...

230
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,460
with the viewers before setting off.

231
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,460
Okay.

232
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,030
- To celebrate the anniversary?
- Yes.

233
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,000
Remember these members.

234
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,570
Anywhere in Korea,
wherever it may be.

235
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,310
We set off again, full of energy.

236
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,980
Will the trip make you laugh so much
that your belly aches?

237
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,380
Or will you end up
with high blood pressure?

238
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,750
Stay tuned and watch
our childish antics!

239
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,620
Let's get going!

240
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,090
Who we are?

241
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
2 Days...

242
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,720
Who we are?

243
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,920
2 Days...

244
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,590
- What?
- What was that?

245
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,160
What are you even doing?

246
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,330
"Who we are?"

247
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,600
- I was talking to our viewers.
- What was that?

248
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,760
That was weird.

249
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,330
You've been saying it for years!

250
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,870
"Who we are?"

251
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,270
- What was that?
- "Who we are?"

252
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,140
- "Who are we?"
- It felt like a quiz show.

253
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,110
- The rain stopped.
- It stopped.

254
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,240
(The weather's in their favor.)

255
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,340
"Who are we?"

256
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,180
(2 Days and 1 Night)

257
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,750
(Hoya and Joon's
1-year anniversary trip)

258
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,810
Let's set off
on the anniversary trip.

259
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,820
- Let's go!
- Okay.

260
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,220
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

261
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,480
You grew up nicely.

262
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,490
Thanks a lot, guys.

263
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,120
- What for?
- I lasted a year.

264
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,320
- You mean that?
- Seriously.

265
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,120
- You know...
- We got really close.

266
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,990
It felt like
it had been longer than a year.

267
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,990
Yes.

268
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,000
- For real?
- Yes.

269
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,930
It doesn't feel like
it was just a year.

270
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,400
It's because
they settled in right away.

271
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,430
- That's right.
- Yes.

272
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,040
During that one year, to me...

273
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,770
This isn't a lie. I'm not lying.

274
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,470
He needs a disclaimer.

275
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,310
- You all became special people.
- That's true.

276
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,180
Wherever I go,
when someone mentions one of you,

277
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,880
- It's extra pleasing.
- I lean in to listen.

278
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,380
- It's nice to hear.
- Yes.

279
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,020
That's true.

280
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,020
(Slightly moved)

281
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,350
- Where are we?
- What are we doing here?

282
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,420
You want to take photos. How sweet.

283
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,660
You can go inside.

284
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,660
- Into the toilet?
- Why?

285
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,190
- The toilet?
- We go into the toilet?

286
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,300
In here?

287
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,900
What is it?

288
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,100
(What awaits the members?)

289
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,130
What's this?

290
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,740
Are there clothes here?

291
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,800
What's this?

292
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,340
Come to the world

293
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,270
- Of fantasy
- Do we go inside?

294
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,680
- Our faces are up there.
- What is this?

295
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,040
Our faces are up there.

296
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
What's this?

297
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,150
- You can go in there.
- What is this?

298
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,450
- Then you can get changed in there.
- Come to

299
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,920
Come on. What is this?

300
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,980
- Gosh, come on.
- I got my hair done.

301
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,050
Look what they gave me.

302
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,020
- What is this? Come on.
- You want me to put this on?

303
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,290
- What's this?
- Please go in and get changed.

304
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,260
- Why must I wear that?
- This is what Sae Ho wanted?

305
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,060
Are you serious?
My stylist already prepared...

306
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,490
- all of my outfits.
- What's this?

307
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,860
- What is this?
- I even got my hair done.

308
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,300
I got inner pants. What's going on?

309
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,630
You have inner pants?

310
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,300
I got a baby outfit.

311
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,400
What...

312
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,370
My pants... My gosh.

313
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,010
I don't have any pants to wear.

314
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,140
- You don't have pants?
- I guess you're going pantless.

315
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,280
What is this?

316
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,610
- Is everyone ready?
- Yes.

317
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,880
- You'll go out 1 at a time.
- Let me go out 1st.

318
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,820
(The first member comes out.)

319
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,450
It looks great.

320
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,320
(Is DinDin's outfit
rather ordinary?)

321
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,590
Everyone is complaining
in the changing room.

322
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,300
- But my outfit looks...
- It looks great.

323
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,860
- better than I thought.
- Yes.

324
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,470
So I wasn't that annoyed.

325
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,870
But everyone else was angry.

326
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,470
I stepped out to see
what was going on. My gosh.

327
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,540
(The other outfits
must not be plain at all.)

328
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,510
(Staff: Laughing)

329
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,080
I went to the beauty salon at 4 a.m.

330
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,550
Look what happened to me
within 20 minutes into our shoot.

331
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,220
(Laughing)

332
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,880
- All right.
- My gosh. Seriously.

333
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,950
(He gives off the vibe of a girl
one can't mess with.)

334
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,020
The level of resentment inside
is outrageous.

335
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,560
The members in the second half
are the highlight.

336
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm curious about what we're doing.

337
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,830
(The members of unusual silhouettes
remain in the changing room.)

338
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,660
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

339
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,670
You're up next.

340
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,870
- I can just walk out?
- Yes.

341
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,170
It looks great on you.

342
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,100
What are you talking about?
No, it doesn't.

343
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,970
- How come you look so normal?
- Yes, my outfit is normal.

344
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,240
(He emerges from the fog.)

345
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,010
So this is on his bucket list?

346
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,780
Why is this on his bucket list?

347
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,250
(The granny is angry.)

348
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,620
But how can an old lady
have such defined shoulders?

349
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,850
How come your shoulders are
so broad? You're an old lady.

350
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,220
(Hoya)

351
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,820
- Hoya
- What?

352
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,960
Hoya

353
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,060
(Excited Hoya shows up.)

354
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,060
- What's this?
- Hoya

355
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,830
(Looking cute and cheerful)

356
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,570
(He's responsible
for this disaster.)

357
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,270
(He's the only one who's excited.)

358
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,340
I love it.
This outfit feels so cool.

359
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,540
So this is on your bucket list?

360
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,310
- Why?
- It's on my bucket list.

361
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,740
But you can easily do this at home.

362
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,980
Yes, I can.

363
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,780
But I can only do that
when we are together.

364
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,010
- Really?
- Yes.

365
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,350
- Let me fix this minor detail.
- What is it?

366
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,350
My gosh, What's he supposed to be?

367
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,920
No baby should look like that,
you know?

368
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,360
(Visually impactful)

369
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,590
He looks so scary for a baby.

370
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,790
(A cold gaze
with a rosy blush on his cheeks)

371
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,060
(Muscular arms)

372
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,700
Given his physique,
he must be on steroids.

373
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,730
(A muscular baby)

374
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,530
You know, you see this in movies.

375
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,540
He's like a lab-grown baby
from a failed genetic modification.

376
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,640
This baby looks so scary.

377
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,140
I like this ring, though.

378
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,080
- I can eat this, right?
- Of course.

379
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,680
- What?
- I like this accessory.

380
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,680
- Coming up next is...
- The highlight.

381
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,450
- an intense-looking lady.
- You know what?

382
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,520
- I fixed her up a bit.
- Great.

383
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,920
My gosh. Seriously.

384
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,520
You look like a cartoon character.

385
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,560
You know what?
I'm good at doing makeup.

386
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,630
- I can make it look classy.
- Should I do this?

387
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,030
(Cameraman: Laughing)

388
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,700
He looks so ugly.

389
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,800
(Laughing)

390
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,770
(This irresistible lady
made everyone laugh.)

391
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,440
(Laughing)

392
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,680
(I am...)

393
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,350
(so pretty.)

394
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,680
(Beauty is my weapon.)

395
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,350
(The makeup artist is
super satisfied.)

396
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,320
Hoya. Joon.

397
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,760
(They burst into laughter
when she calls their names.)

398
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,590
Hoya. Joon.

399
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,260
(Impressed)

400
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,900
Why are you doing this to us?

401
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,870
What have you planned for us?

402
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,770
I just wasted some good money
at the salon. Don't you agree?

403
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,440
- You...
- Yes.

404
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,310
- You can pull off 1,000 characters.
- He's a pro.

405
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,480
- This is so funny.
- Seriously.

406
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,710
- What is on your bucket list?
- Gosh.

407
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,350
To celebrate his first anniversary
on the show,

408
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,020
he wanted to wear group costumes
with everyone...

409
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,550
and take a family picture.

410
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,750
- So that's what we prepared.
- Yes.

411
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,420
Hoya and Joon would be twins.

412
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,960
You guys are their grandma, dad,
mom, and older sister.

413
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,860
- He's the dad?
- I'm the dad?

414
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,760
- I can't be married to her.
- I see.

415
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,760
- Come here, honey.
- Dad, come this way.

416
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,230
- My gosh.
- What if she beats him?

417
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,900
(I don't want to go to her.)

418
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,570
I told you to square your shoulders
when you come over.

419
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,940
Square your shoulders.
Show them your teeth.

420
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,070
- Okay.
- Great.

421
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,210
- I love you.
- I love you.

422
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,450
- I love you.
- Yes.

423
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,720
And Hoya came up with a rule too.

424
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,280
Everyone must be encouraging,
even when someone messes up.

425
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,450
We'll laugh at everything
anyone says today.

426
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,690
Everyone should participate.

427
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,990
I want us...

428
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,660
- To participate. To be happy.
- to be a happy family today.

429
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,630
So I want us to have
stronger teamwork than ever today.

430
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,800
- I want us to get along.
- Yes.

431
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,300
All right.

432
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,140
(What sort of day
awaits the family today?)

433
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,140
(Kissing)

434
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,040
All right. It's time
to take your family picture.

435
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
- Yes.
- Yes.

436
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,680
We're going to take it
in the photo booth behind you.

437
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,680
But your job won't be that simple.

438
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,350
All of you must take pictures...

439
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,760
alternating between the two booths.

440
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,560
I bet we only get ten seconds.

441
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,690
You can take eight pictures
at each booth.

442
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,730
You can pick four pictures
from each booth.

443
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,730
Okay. What next?

444
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,600
For each picture
that clearly shows...

445
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,500
all of your eyes, nose, and mouth,

446
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,970
we will give you two dollars
for your allowance.

447
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,510
Then the maximum amount
of money we can earn...

448
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,640
- is 16 dollars.
- That's correct.

449
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,540
We must go back and forth
at the right time.

450
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,680
- That's right. Yes.
- We don't have to hurry.

451
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,710
- We can just time it well.
- Of course.

452
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,750
- We just need four good pictures.
- Right.

453
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,180
We just have to gather our faces.

454
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,290
(Like this)

455
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,020
I've taken pictures at the booth
with my family.

456
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,720
My son is short.

457
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,660
I had to move back a little more.

458
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,090
When he tried to lower his head,
I made him stand tall.

459
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,160
Like how he usually stands.

460
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,500
Then I was leaning on the wall.

461
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,000
I was leaning on the wall
completely.

462
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,570
- I made him stand tall.
- Okay.

463
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,930
Only our eyes, nose, and mouth
have to show, right?

464
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,300
- Just our eyes, nose, and mouth.
- They must be in the picture.

465
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,040
No, you guys have to
adjust the height.

466
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,870
We'll start right away
once he gives you the sign.

467
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,470
You're twins. So the three of you
will do it together.

468
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,580
- The three of us should do it.
- Sure.

469
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,910
- The three of you here.
- You go in the front.

470
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,550
Come on in.

471
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,210
- What?
- Let's go.

472
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,920
- Behind Joon.
- Five seconds.

473
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,250
Come on in.

474
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,590
(Run, everyone.)

475
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,590
- Behind Joon.
- Five seconds.

476
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,920
Jong Min in the front.

477
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,560
Hurry. Three, two, one.
Come on in now.

478
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,530
- What?
- Hurry.

479
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,290
- Go to the other booth.
- My face is in it.

480
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,560
- Hurry up.
- Go to the other booth.

481
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,160
(Did they succeed
with the first picture?)

482
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,830
(Jong Min's mouth is missing.)

483
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,440
(Let's go to the other booth first.)

484
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,700
- Go to the other booth.
- Hurry up.

485
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,200
- My face is in it.
- Five, four... Hurry.

486
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,270
- Three,
- Three.

487
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,710
two, one.

488
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,680
- We must go to the other booth.
- We must go.

489
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
- Hey.
- Gosh, hurry.

490
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,140
- Se Yoon.
- We only get five seconds.

491
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,180
(Hoya left too soon.)

492
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,450
- We must go to the other booth.
- We must go.

493
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,520
- Hey.
- Gosh, hurry.

494
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,180
- Se Yoon.
- We only get five seconds.

495
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,720
- What is this?
- Your face isn't in it.

496
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,190
What is this? This is way too fast.

497
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,320
(But their time is already up.)

498
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,390
- What? Go to the other booth.
- It's going way too fast.

499
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,930
- You want us to have no money.
- What's this?

500
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,130
(Laughing)

501
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,430
- What's wrong with him?
- My gosh. How...

502
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,030
Gosh, we don't have much time.

503
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,740
- What is this?
- This is too little time.

504
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,110
- Gosh, we don't have much time.
- This is too little time.

505
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,740
(Taking a family picture
is such a challenge.)

506
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,540
- No way. This is over now.
- Gosh.

507
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,610
Go to the other booth.

508
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,180
(He takes a picture all by himself.)

509
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,880
- Come back here!
- My gosh.

510
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
(I won't let you get away
with this.)

511
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,050
Five, four, three,

512
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,720
two, one.

513
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,220
(But they smile
when they take pictures.)

514
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,220
- We got it.
- We got it.

515
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,020
- We got it.
- Move!

516
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,690
- Go to the other booth.
- Move!

517
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,990
- We got it. Move!
- We got it.

518
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,600
(They run over to the other booth
as soon as they succeed.)

519
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,360
- We can't.
- The time is up for this one.

520
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,400
(Again,
Hoya is the first one to arrive.)

521
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,670
- How many seconds?
- It's over.

522
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,800
Come back. This isn't possible.

523
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,000
The timing won't work.

524
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,470
(3 pictures of Hoya)

525
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,310
We only have a second left.

526
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,810
I noticed that the timing was off.

527
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,310
What is this?

528
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,310
Hey.

529
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,410
(So far, they only succeeded
in one picture.)

530
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,550
(Is this even possible?)

531
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,950
(Let's not give up.
Let's keep going.)

532
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,920
- What is this?
- We have five seconds left.

533
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,590
- Hey.
- Three, two, one.

534
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,790
Only stick out your face.

535
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,560
Only stick out your face.

536
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,590
(They succeeded at the blue booth.)

537
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,660
- Go.
- We got it.

538
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,260
- Seven seconds. Six,
- Hurry.

539
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,400
- five,
- We must go back.

540
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,800
- four, three,
- Three,

541
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,700
- two...
- two, one.

542
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,570
- We have to get this one.
- Hey, you're not in it.

543
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,040
- No.
- No, it starts here.

544
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,470
Seriously. We have a second left.

545
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,980
- All right. Five. Hurry up.
- Four,

546
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,310
three, two...

547
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,380
(They pick up the speed
after succeeding 2 times in a row.)

548
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,850
- Let's go.
- Go to the other booth.

549
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,320
- Go to the other booth.
- Hurry.

550
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,950
- Move.
- Five, four... Hurry.

551
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,850
- Come over here.
- Hurry up.

552
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,320
- Five.
- Four,

553
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,390
three, two, one.

554
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,030
- We got it. Go over.
- Hey, we can't.

555
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,060
- Go.
- It's over.

556
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,860
- I give up.
- How many seconds?

557
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,900
It's over there.

558
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,600
- Go.
- We'll never have enough time.

559
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,670
The timing is off.

560
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,940
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two...

561
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,910
- We must get four pictures here.
- Hey, you weren't in it.

562
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,370
- No.
- We must take it here.

563
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,410
- Stay here.
- They said we couldn't do it.

564
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,540
- They said we had to move around.
- Let's go.

565
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,810
- Just pretend to go there.
- Go and fail.

566
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,850
- Hey. Five.
- Okay.

567
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,010
(Grandma was a master cheater.)

568
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,920
- You must go to the other booth.
- I did.

569
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,490
- Four, three,
- It won't work.

570
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,350
- There was no time left.
- two, one.

571
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,390
(Come here, Hoya.)

572
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,590
(They got the last picture
by cheating.)

573
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,260
(The game is over.)

574
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,800
We must pick the ones
with all of our faces.

575
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,770
With all of our faces.

576
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,130
(Hoya and his sister
pick out the photos.)

577
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,400
- This has all of our faces.
- No, not this one.

578
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,740
- His mouth isn't in it.
- Right.

579
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,510
- Don't pick that one then.
- One, two...

580
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,040
- His mouth isn't in it.
- Why give us only five seconds?

581
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,340
Come on. This is so irritating.

582
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,010
Who would pay money
to take pictures like this?

583
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,780
This one. Here.

584
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,050
- This one is good, right?
- Yes.

585
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,820
- All of our faces show in this too.
- Yes, that one too.

586
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,550
- We're good, right?
- Yes.

587
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,020
This is more than enough.

588
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,690
Our photos are being printed.

589
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,290
(How much money
can the members earn?)

590
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,790
All right.
Give us the pictures first.

591
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,230
Let us review the pictures
for a moment.

592
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,970
Hey, guys.

593
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,330
You guys did a great job.

594
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,400
(Getting nervous for some reason)

595
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,570
I told you all of your eyes, nose,
and mouth must show.

596
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,610
- Yes.
- Yes.

597
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,650
DinDin, look at the photos.
The pictures on the bottom...

598
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,280
Only parts of Jong Min's mouth
were in the pictures.

599
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,590
(Grandma is flustered.)

600
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,690
(It seems all of their faces
are in the pictures.)

601
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,490
(But Jong Min's mouth wasn't
in the pictures.)

602
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,660
- Why...
- Jong Min.

603
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
(Distancing)

604
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,430
- Why?
- Hold on.

605
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,030
We're supposed to smile today.

606
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,900
You look handsome
without your mouth.

607
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,070
- This is great.
- Really?

608
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,270
Today is
all about giving compliments.

609
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,600
- So...
- You know what?

610
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,000
If everything goes well,
it won't be fun.

611
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,440
- Right.
- It's great that...

612
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,880
Jong Min messed up big time!

613
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,180
- Gosh, this was great.
- We don't have to criticize him.
But we can ask him.

614
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,750
- This is pretty good.
- We got a lot of pictures.

615
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,980
- Yes. Six photos.
- Per...

616
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,980
- Per picture, you'll get 2 dollars.
- It's 12 dollars then.

617
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,250
- Six of your pictures will count.
- That's not bad.

618
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,190
- You'll get 12 dollars.
- Okay!

619
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,190
Great.

620
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,790
- We can only get two churros.
- All right. Here's your allowance.

621
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,590
Are we going to get on the ride?

622
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,860
No.

623
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,030
(Mom is a scaredy-cat.)

624
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,160
- Everyone, Hoya...
- Hoya.

625
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,370
loved amusement rides...

626
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,900
since he was in his mother's womb.

627
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
- I loved them.
- Good for you.

628
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,600
This is exactly what he said.

629
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,740
- So?
- How could he know he liked them...

630
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,470
- even before he was born?
- That's what I said?

631
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,780
- No way.
- Sae Ho.

632
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,380
Hoya loved going
to amusement parks...

633
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,980
since he was in his mother's womb.

634
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,980
(Writer: Laughing)

635
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,680
- I see.
- I love going to amusement parks.

636
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,680
Hoya said that
getting on rides was...

637
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,220
- on his bucket list.
- I'm serious.

638
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,620
This time, all of you will go
and get on an amusement ride.

639
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,960
- Okay.
- Let's go.

640
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,290
- What is this?
- I love it.

641
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,930
We'll throw up
even on a pirate ship.

642
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,430
- Jong Min and I will throw up.
- I did.

643
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,800
Same here.
I really can't go on that.

644
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,200
You'll be fine once you get on it.

645
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,270
- Let's go.
- Mom.

646
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,910
- I'll get going, Mom.
- Okay. Go ahead, son.

647
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,270
- You're my wife.
- I need to watch our stuff here.

648
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,440
- Mom, hurry.
- Mom.

649
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,240
Are you sure this will be safe?

650
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,310
Mom. You'll have to ride it.

651
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,310
Hey, it's not suitable for the elderly
and people in poor health.

652
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,420
- What?
- Mom.

653
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,120
- You were born in 1979.
- Over there.

654
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,750
- It's not suitable for the elderly.
- Let's go.

655
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,750
It's okay.

656
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,890
Mom.

657
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,990
Mom, hurry up.

658
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,230
Give your mommy a kiss.

659
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,290
Give me a kiss.

660
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,530
My son, give me a kiss.
You too, my daughter.

661
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,070
Why is this on your bucket list?

662
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,300
I love amusement rides.

663
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,770
- My bucket list is...
- Yes?

664
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,370
riding all the roller coasters
in the world.

665
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,410
- Really?
- Yes.

666
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,910
- Mother, will you be okay?
- If...

667
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,910
(Jong Min slows down
as he doesn't want to get on it.)

668
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,010
- What?
- Mother?

669
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,750
Gosh, it said
it wasn't suitable for the elderly.

670
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,350
But they're making me get on it.

671
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,390
- What?
- Hello.

672
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,760
- Say hello.
- Hello.

673
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,820
Hello.

674
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,730
Hello. Is this really scary?

675
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,260
- It's fun. It's not scary.
- Gosh.

676
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
- Really?
- Pair up.

677
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,000
- What?
- Could you stand here facing me?

678
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,870
- All right.
- Hello.

679
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,000
- Hello.
- They're already on it.

680
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,270
Are you guys ready for it?

681
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,640
- No. Not at all.
- Yes.

682
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,470
- I love it.
- I'm not ready!

683
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,080
This is considered
the most thrilling ride here.

684
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,610
You can earn more allowance
on the roller coaster.

685
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,150
Two of you will ride
the roller coaster.

686
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,120
They will present the question.

687
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,390
(The 6 presenters
will sit in front of them.)

688
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,460
A letter will be written
on their hands.

689
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,960
(A letter is written
on their hands.)

690
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,260
- You must combine the 12 letters...
- What?

691
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,660
- to come up with a word.
- What?

692
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,930
(They must look at the letters
and put them together...)

693
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,270
(to find the right answer
that fits the category.)

694
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,700
We'll sit in the back
and look at the letters...

695
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,100
when they raise their hands.

696
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,340
- Okay.
- That's it.

697
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,770
(Here's an example.)

698
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,110
(Category: 4-character idiom,
3 possible right answers)

699
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,640
(They must combine the letters
to find the right answers.)

700
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,910
(Then they can rack up
more allowance.)

701
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,720
(There are 12 letters
and 3 possible right answers.)

702
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,790
(But they must do this
while riding the roller coaster.)

703
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,990
We must say the right answer...

704
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,120
- once we get back?
- Right.

705
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,720
When you come back,
I'll ask, "What's the right answer?"

706
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,660
- That's when you can answer it.
- We must look behind?

707
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,290
Each right answer
will earn you two dollars.

708
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,300
Okay.

709
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,170
Each pair can earn
as much as six dollars.

710
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,370
If all 3 pairs succeed,
you can earn 18 dollars in total.

711
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,940
Then here's what we need to do.

712
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,540
We must pair up first.

713
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,610
- It's...
- In my opinion,

714
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,840
Se Yoon,

715
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,510
Jong Min, and Seon Ho
aren't good with roller coasters.

716
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,150
- The rest of us... Yes.
- We must split them up.

717
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,350
- Joon and Jong Min should pair up.
- That sounds about right.

718
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,450
Se Yoon and I will pair up.

719
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,580
Seon Ho and Sae Ho should pair up.

720
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,580
- Okay.
- Yes.

721
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,190
Then who's the first pair?
Get on the roller coaster now.

722
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,260
(How much money
can the members earn?)

723
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,990
- Will you be okay?
- I'll go first.

724
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,160
Hold on. What do I do with this?

725
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,330
Don't worry, Jong Min.

726
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,200
(Glancing)

727
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,830
There must've been fat people...

728
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,200
who couldn't ride it...

729
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,300
because they couldn't put on
the seatbelt.

730
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,440
(Is it possible to be turned away
because of the seatbelt?)

731
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,700
You'll have no problem riding it.

732
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,940
Is that so?

733
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,640
(Disappointed)

734
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,640
- So...
- Gosh, I'm so nervous!

735
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,910
Why is this on his bucket list?

736
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,780
(It's difficult to understand
Hoya's bucket list.)

737
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,780
- Sae Ho.
- Hey.

738
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,820
- Hey.
- You got this!

739
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,120
You got this!

740
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,120
Wait. The safety bar is still up.

741
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
- Lower it.
- I have to do it?

742
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,960
Why did it go back up?

743
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,560
- They'll do it for you.
- This is weird.

744
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,460
- Please help them.
- Gosh, the bar is going down.

745
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,490
- Why did it go back up?
- Sir, this isn't coming down.

746
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,630
(Gesturing with urgency)

747
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,830
This is safe, right?

748
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,530
- It is.
- This is good, right?

749
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,670
- You never know. Jong Min.
- Gosh, hold on. This...

750
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,270
You all know what you have to do,
right?

751
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,240
- Yes, we do.
- We'll begin.

752
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,110
- You...
- I'll take care of everything.

753
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,440
- Have fun.
- Don't worry.

754
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,510
What? They're going.

755
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,180
- What? Hold on.
- They're four-character idioms!

756
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,550
- We'll be back.
- They're four-character idioms.

757
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,080
(Jong Min, you're in trouble now.)

758
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,280
They're four-character idioms.

759
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,550
(Thanks to him,
Jong Min loosens up.)

760
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,560
- Don't worry.
- We'll be back.

761
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
- They're 4-character idioms.
- They're 4-character idioms.

762
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,660
- Jong Min, bye.
- I don't...

763
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
I don't think Jong Min knows
what he's riding now.

764
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,860
- Gosh. This is scary.
- Jong Min.

765
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,030
- Look at that.
- Joon.

766
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,400
- My gosh. That's way too high.
- Why is it so high?

767
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
It's been so long...

768
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,370
- since I got on a ride.
- It rained a lot.

769
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,640
Jong Min, now...
Hold on. I'm a bit scared.

770
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,980
(Their upper bodies are almost
perpendicular to the tracks.)

771
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,980
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

772
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,310
Why am I scared?
I usually don't get scared.

773
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,150
Gosh, hold on. This is...

774
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,920
- It's way too high.
- Gosh, this...

775
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,380
It's way too high.

776
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,420
- Jong Min, relax.
- What's going on?

777
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
- What's that?
- What?

778
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,690
(Presenting the letters
without a heads-up)

779
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,790
- Jong Min, relax.
- What's going on?

780
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,790
- What's that?
- What? Did we start?

781
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,130
- What?
- You must give us a heads-up!

782
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,890
- You must give us a heads-up!
- Do that again.

783
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,100
I couldn't see anything!

784
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,130
You must give us a heads-up!

785
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,370
- You can't surprise us.
- I was looking at the view.

786
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,530
- What a great view. Jong Min.
- Show us one more time.

787
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,800
The view there is amazing.

788
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,210
(A dizzying view)

789
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,410
(Glancing)

790
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,480
- Forget about the view.
- Jong Min, we'll drop at 90°.

791
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Hey.

792
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,710
- My gosh, we're going up.
- What's going on?

793
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,050
I have a bad feeling about this.

794
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,480
- This is bad. We're at the peak.
- Gosh, the view...

795
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,250
Please hold onto
the safety bar tightly.

796
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,850
- Hold on tight.
- I'm so scared.

797
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,250
- It's so scary.
- I shouldn't put my hands up.

798
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,060
- Three, two, one.
- I can't.

799
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,990
- Here comes the drop!
- Gosh, it's...

800
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,190
My gosh.

801
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,460
(The moment of the descent
is about to hit them.)

802
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,900
(Descending)

803
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,100
No!

804
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,040
(His head drops low
as soon as it goes down.)

805
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,770
(Screaming)

806
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,810
Hey. My gosh.

807
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,250
(The letters are revealed
for the second time at the drop.)

808
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,250
(This time,
they're doing jazz hands.)

809
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,720
(But Jong Min can't even look
at the letters.)

810
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,830
(Joon is doing his best
to hang in there.)

811
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,030
(They must look at the letters
to figure out the right answers.)

812
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,600
(The first sudden descent
ends in a matter of seconds.)

813
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,370
I couldn't even see a letter.

814
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,140
(The same goes for Jong Min.)

815
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,370
(This time, they take turns
to show the letters.)

816
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,370
(Sad, bearing, too much, bad)

817
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,880
(Find 4 4-character idioms.)

818
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,080
(Misery, company, rind, trust)

819
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,010
(Sad, bearing, too much, bad)

820
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,280
(Joon tries to keep his eyes open
to earn more allowance.)

821
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,520
My legs are in the air.

822
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,790
- My gosh.
- Jazz hands.

823
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,130
(Was Joon able to see the letters?)

824
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,100
Did you see Jong Min just now?

825
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,170
Is he dead?

826
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,730
- He was like this.
- He was like this.

827
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,100
Will they raise their hands
when the roller coaster goes down?

828
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,140
No. They have their own plan.

829
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,340
They will show the letters
several times.

830
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,810
- But...
- They just did it.

831
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,680
(Actually,
as for these brave presenters...)

832
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,780
Ready, set, go.

833
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,120
(On the verbal order
of the main writer...)

834
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Go.

835
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,680
- Jazz hands.
- Jazz hands.

836
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,090
(They're perfectly in sync
for each section.)

837
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,160
- We'll go with the rainbow one.
- Gosh!

838
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,890
Rainbow!

839
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,430
(Loves, in, all, table,
misery, company, rind, trust)

840
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,760
(Sad, bearing, too much, bad)

841
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,660
Please stop this.

842
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,000
(Joon has gotten used to
the roller coaster now.)

843
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,170
(He begins to see
the letters clearly.)

844
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,100
(Jong Min's situation
hasn't changed.)

845
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,600
I hate this.

846
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,610
(Laughing)

847
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,410
(Bouncing)

848
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,740
(He can't lower his guard
even for a moment.)

849
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,050
It's time. Let's begin. Go.

850
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,220
Let's go. One, two.

851
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,950
(He almost missed his chance
as he was busy laughing.)

852
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,990
(Loves, in, all, table,
misery, company, rind, trust)

853
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,020
(Sad, bearing, too much, bad)

854
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,860
This is the worst.

855
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,690
(He couldn't open his eyes
even once.)

856
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,960
(And he's arrived.)

857
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,160
Show me the letters!

858
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,600
Did you see them?

859
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,840
Jong Min, you kept your head down.

860
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,310
You didn't make any effort to look.

861
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,740
(We shot the crown
of Jong Min's head for 3 minutes.)

862
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,840
This is impossible.

863
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,610
Your head was completely down.

864
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,480
It was so scary.

865
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,480
- Gosh.
- This was fun.

866
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,720
Show us now!

867
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,590
Show us the letters!

868
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,520
(Dear customer, the ride is over.)

869
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,960
Why aren't you showing us
the letters?

870
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,760
You're back.

871
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,560
Are you okay? He's saying that
you didn't show him anything.

872
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,630
- They didn't show us.
- What's the answer?

873
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,000
Too much is as bad as too little.
Bearing in mind all the time.

874
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,100
Misery loves company.

875
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,800
(Too much is as bad as too little.
Bearing in mind all the time.)

876
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,470
(Joon said 3 4-character idioms
right away.)

877
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,640
Joon answered.

878
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,970
- He answered them all.
- He did.

879
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,840
(Will his 3 answers be correct
in his 1st attempt?)

880
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,280
- He answered them all.
- Two of them are correct.

881
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,410
Well done.

882
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,080
(There must be trust
between friends.)

883
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,380
(Bearing in mind all the time.)

884
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,790
(Misery loves company.)

885
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,650
(2 of them are correct.)

886
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,490
The 1st team got 2 answers correct.

887
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,090
- I did my best.
- Well done.

888
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,090
It's not scary.
(Shaking)

889
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,300
It's not scary?

890
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,430
Se Yoon, you can still give up now.

891
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,500
- You can still give up now.
- What?

892
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,640
You can still give up now.

893
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,300
Seriously. I'm not joking.

894
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,610
(DinDin and Se Yoon get on
with a lot of worries.)

895
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,670
- Gosh.
- Do you...

896
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,410
- need anything?
- No.

897
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,480
Hey.

898
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,980
Hey.

899
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,150
- The seat is too small for me.
- Please get ready.

900
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,580
- This is...
- Excuse me.

901
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,480
Can someone take a look over here?

902
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,150
- Se Yoon says that it's small.
- The seat is too small.

903
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,190
No, it's okay.

904
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,190
(Requesting emergency assistance)

905
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,260
Hang on.

906
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,190
- My goodness.
- He must be serious.

907
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,460
(Pressing with all his might)

908
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,660
- The pressure is for safety.
- Okay.

909
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,800
Safety is the most important.

910
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,030
DinDin, Se Yoon.

911
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,700
This time, it's movies and dramas.

912
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,970
- Movies and dramas?
- Yes.

913
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,500
How many movies and dramas
are there?

914
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,600
- Are there three?
- Yes.

915
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,440
I know many movies and dramas.

916
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,270
"The Wild Days."

917
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,540
- "Sandglass."
- All right.

918
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,980
- It may not be four characters.
- "Autumn in My Heart."

919
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,850
(The answers may not be
four characters.)

920
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,510
Keep your back straight,
and look ahead.

921
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,520
You can stay still this way.

922
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,190
Okay.

923
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,520
- You can do it.
- Let's go.

924
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,790
Se Yoon, relax.

925
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,260
You're doomed.

926
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,230
They think that it won't be scary.

927
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,730
- "Oldboy."
- Please run it slowly.

928
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,960
- Yes.
- "Oldboy."

929
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,000
Let's go!

930
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,670
Show us the answers.

931
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,500
I weigh 120kg.

932
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,800
I got a health checkup yesterday,

933
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,140
and I weighed 122kg.

934
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,280
I'm the only one with shoulders
wider than the seat.

935
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,250
How did you position your shoulders?
This might hurt me.

936
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,550
- Push them back like this.
- But this is...

937
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,520
- Slightly.
- What's this?

938
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,550
Slightly.

939
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,620
(They blew
their first chance for nothing.)

940
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,720
- That's it?
- Hey, we were discussing.

941
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,490
Se Yoon's seat was too small,
so we were discussing.

942
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,190
(They missed the letters...)

943
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,590
(while the ride gets closer
to the peak.)

944
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,960
(Se Yoon's eyes are losing focus.)

945
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,600
We have to look forward.

946
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,860
I don't think I can.

947
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,630
- When you look ahead...
- Are we going down?

948
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,340
When you look ahead, it's not scary.

949
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,570
Please hold onto...

950
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,740
- Goodness.
- When you look ahead...

951
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,980
When you look ahead, it's not scary.

952
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
(Moaning)

953
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,580
- Oh, no.
- Three, two, one.

954
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,610
(Exclaiming)

955
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,980
(Exclaiming)

956
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,520
Two, one. Descent.

957
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,760
(The letters were shown
for quite a long time.)

958
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,330
(He closed his eyes
and couldn't see anything.)

959
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,570
(Screaming)

960
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,710
(They let themselves go
on the roller coaster.)

961
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,740
- My gosh.
- I couldn't see it.

962
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,080
(In the flat section,
they have a moment to breathe.)

963
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,750
We're going to do the wave.

964
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,850
Ready, set, go.

965
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,850
- One, two.
- One, two.

966
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:56,920
Go.

967
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,220
(Yoo, gye, sae, bae)

968
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,420
- "Yoo, gye..."
- "Yoo, gye, sae..."

969
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,620
(Deul, lang, mi, po)

970
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,590
(Look for 3 movies or dramas)

971
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,360
(Shin, eui, tae, sae,)

972
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,960
(deul, lang, mi, po)

973
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,860
- "Yoo, gye..."
- "Yoo, gye, sae..."

974
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,470
(They saw a few letters
before going down.)

975
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,530
"Yoo, gye, sae, gae."

976
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,600
- "Yoo, gye, sae, gae."
- "Yoo, gye, sae..."

977
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,270
"Yoo, gye, sae, gae."

978
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:16,070
("Yoo, gye, sae, gae" echoes
in the amusement park.)

979
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,810
Thanks to Joon, we answered two.

980
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,480
- Right.
- I know. Without Joon...

981
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,810
Which characters did you see?

982
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,350
They're much harder to see
than you think. It's quick.

983
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,250
You couldn't see any of the letters?

984
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,320
When going up, I saw them briefly.

985
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,420
They're dead. Se Yoon is dead.

986
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,620
(Laughing)

987
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,690
Se Yoon passed out.

988
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,030
- "Yoo, gye, sae..."
- "Yoo, gye, sae, gae."

989
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,100
"Yoo, gye."

990
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,900
(Moaning)

991
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,900
Here it is.

992
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,100
- "Deul, lang."
- "Tae, sae."

993
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,170
(Shin, eui, tae, sae)

994
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,440
(Yoo, gye, sae, bae)

995
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,970
"Mol, ra, sae, gae."

996
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,640
- "Mol, ra, sae, gae?"
- "Mol, ra, sae, gae."

997
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,740
(I don't know anything.)

998
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,140
Please get ready for the rainbow.

999
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,240
Go.

1000
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,880
Rainbow.

1001
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,120
(Yoo, gae, sae, bae, shin, eui,
tae, sae, deul, lang, mi, po)

1002
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,350
- I see "mi."
- "Deul, lang..."

1003
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,850
(Meanwhile, Se Yoon caught "mi.")

1004
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,090
One more time.

1005
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,090
(Excited DinDin the Kid)

1006
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,990
(Donald Fatty)

1007
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,060
One more time.

1008
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,490
One more time.

1009
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,530
(We go once again as he requested.)

1010
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,300
One, two.

1011
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,430
- What's that?
- I can't see any.

1012
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,470
I can't see them at all.

1013
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,970
(He's so excited
that he reveals his front teeth.)

1014
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,670
(He's still being Donald Fatty.)

1015
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,710
I couldn't see them.

1016
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,810
(How many answers will they guess?)

1017
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,810
"Sae, gae."

1018
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:31,950
(DinDin keeps repeating
"sae" and "gae.")

1019
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,950
"Sae, gae."

1020
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,020
(Se Yoon's soul hasn't
returned yet.)

1021
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,590
"Sae, gae." What could it be?

1022
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,690
"Mol, ba."

1023
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,220
I might have seen "Titanic."

1024
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,260
I also saw "sae" and "gae."

1025
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
(My head is completely empty.)

1026
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,730
(DinDin and Se Yoon return safely.)

1027
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,230
"Deul, mol, deul."

1028
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,900
Moon Se Yoon.

1029
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,430
- I couldn't see anything.
- Really?

1030
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,340
- Everyone, what's the answer?
- He cried.

1031
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,810
- Oh, no.
- He's crying.

1032
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,410
- He's crying.
- Se Yoon is crying.

1033
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,470
(Se Yoon is crying?)

1034
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,510
(There are definitely tears
in Se Yoon's eyes.)

1035
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,250
He's really crying.

1036
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,250
He really is.

1037
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,120
(His tears match his makeup.)

1038
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,360
- He's so ugly.
- He's crying.

1039
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,530
All right.

1040
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,030
- Gosh.
- What's the answer?

1041
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,090
"Titanic."

1042
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,330
"Sandglass."

1043
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,800
I saw the word "bad."
"Bad Housewife?"

1044
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,000
"Bad..."

1045
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,240
- He's crying.
- I also saw "mi."

1046
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,040
"Bad Married Couple?"

1047
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,580
(He wipes off his tears first.)

1048
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,080
- Three.
- "Bad Married Couple."

1049
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,010
- Two.
- How many did we get?

1050
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,080
So far,

1051
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,620
- none of them are correct.
- What?

1052
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,850
- Seriously?
- What are you doing?

1053
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,250
"Titanic."

1054
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,420
- He says that it's wrong.
- It's wrong.

1055
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,120
- You have three seconds.
- "The Wild Days."

1056
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,830
- In 3,
- "200 Pounds Beauty."

1057
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,930
- two,
- "The Witch."

1058
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,090
- one.
- "Sandglass."

1059
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,400
Wrong.

1060
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,830
- "Lovers in Paris."
- This team got...

1061
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,830
- zero answers.
- What?

1062
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,130
What are the answers?

1063
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,730
(What are the answers that
DinDin and Se Yoon failed to get?)

1064
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,240
("Yumi's Cells,")

1065
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,670
("New World," "Veteran")

1066
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,140
(0 correct answers)

1067
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,610
We thought that
the titles were four characters.

1068
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,450
- That's not true.
- You didn't explain it to us.

1069
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,810
I'll go again with Se Yoon.

1070
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,050
- No.
- Let us go one more time.

1071
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,250
- Let me stop crying.
- Come on.

1072
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,420
I'll cry only once a day.

1073
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,020
- All right.
- Cry only once a day.

1074
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,790
Let's ride it together at the end
as a celebration.

1075
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,320
- Let's do that.
- To take a group photo.

1076
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,860
They don't show you
when you're going down.

1077
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,160
- Suddenly, while going up...
- Really? Okay.

1078
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,730
- You have to keep watching them.
- Let's stay focused.

1079
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,830
- Please get on the ride.
- They keep riding it.

1080
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,900
Are you okay?

1081
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,800
(They prepare
the next question calmly.)

1082
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,710
- Take off your suspenders.
- My suspenders?

1083
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,170
(The last team, Seon Ho and Sae Ho)

1084
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,740
- Jong Hyun.
- What's the category?

1085
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,310
- What's the keyword?
- All right.

1086
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,280
We didn't set it up intentionally.

1087
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,320
- But it's capital cities.
- What?

1088
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,350
(The question went to Seon Ho
who's terrible at capital cities.)

1089
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,520
- Capital cities.
- Capital cities.

1090
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,650
- I don't know many capital cities.
- I don't know any.

1091
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,620
It's very easy.

1092
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,960
- Let's go.
- We can do it.

1093
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,630
- Ottawa, Canada's capital city.
- You can do it.

1094
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,260
Win six dollars so that we can eat.

1095
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,230
Just keep looking forward.

1096
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,600
What's that?

1097
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,500
It's okay. We'll be going up there.
That's the hard part.

1098
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,240
- They might show us suddenly.
- Doesn't it feel refreshing?

1099
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,440
- You're okay, right?
- I'm okay for now.

1100
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,610
Keep your back straight
and look forward, okay?

1101
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,310
We're going up.

1102
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,180
They'll raise their hands suddenly.

1103
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,580
Look at your line.
I'll look at mine.

1104
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,320
Once you read yours, read mine too.

1105
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
- What's going on?
- What?

1106
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,420
"La."

1107
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,420
- I can't read the characters.
- I saw "la" and "am."

1108
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,320
- "La, am?"
- "La, am."

1109
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,930
(Seon Ho already read two letters.)

1110
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,460
That's how they raise their hands?

1111
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,190
We're here now.

1112
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,670
(They arrive at the peak
with a big gain.)

1113
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,000
That's the hard part.

1114
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,940
"La, am."
They'll raise their hands again.

1115
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,970
"La, am."

1116
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,440
Amsterdam.

1117
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,440
(He thinks of "Amsterdam"
before going down.)

1118
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,710
- Amsterdam.
- Okay.

1119
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,610
(Hoya's favorite moment)

1120
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,050
(A thrilling drop)

1121
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,720
(Hoya is excited.)

1122
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,990
Remember "Amsterdam."

1123
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,990
- Amsterdam?
- Yes, Amsterdam.

1124
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,390
(Team Seon Ho and Sae Ho
started off smoothly.)

1125
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,400
(Grandma Jong Min
is still out of it.)

1126
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
- Jong Min.
- That's better.

1127
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,660
You seem out of it.

1128
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,770
(I'm not actually laughing.)

1129
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,370
Are you okay, Jong Min?

1130
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,600
Let's stop with the rides.

1131
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,210
Let's have a corn dog instead.

1132
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,870
- Gosh.
- Isn't it fun?

1133
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,610
- Get ready, set, go.
- It's not fun,

1134
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,010
- but I can bear it.
- One, two.

1135
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,780
(Ha, reu, deu, deu)
(Ma, seu, la, li)

1136
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,780
(Am, peu, dam, tae)

1137
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,220
(Guess the 3 capital cities.)

1138
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,650
- "Ha, ma."
- "Ha."

1139
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,660
"Ha."

1140
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,520
- What did you say?
- "Ha."

1141
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,260
- Start.
- What?

1142
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,390
(Ha, reu, deu, deu)

1143
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,430
(Ma, seu, la, li)

1144
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,430
(Am, peu, dam, tae)

1145
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,800
- "Seu, peu?"
- What? I can't see them.

1146
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
(Sae Ho saw "seu" and "peu.")

1147
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,370
Go. Rainbow.

1148
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,000
"Am, peu."

1149
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,870
- "Am, peu."
- "Am, peu?"

1150
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,070
A capital city with "peu" in it?

1151
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,640
- It's Prague.
- Prague.

1152
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,880
- Amsterdam, Prague.
- Amsterdam, Prague.

1153
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,610
- We got 2.
- We have 1 left.

1154
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,220
The last 1 has 3 characters.

1155
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,620
This is good.
Both of them have their heads up.

1156
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,550
- Seon Ho and Sae Ho.
- Both of them have their heads up.

1157
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,820
This is looking good.

1158
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,460
(They can feel the successful energy
under the track.)

1159
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,490
They're raising their hands again.

1160
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,330
(Ha, reu, deu, deu, ma, seu,
la, li, am, peu, dam, tae)

1161
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,760
- I see "seu."
- "Ma."

1162
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,060
What? "Ma."

1163
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,000
- Amsterdam, Prague.
- I see.

1164
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,170
"Ma" is missing.

1165
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,770
What could it be?

1166
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,770
- What's Spain's capital city?
- Madrid.

1167
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,940
It must be Madrid.

1168
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,070
- You're right.
- Yes.

1169
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,240
Madrid, Prague,

1170
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,540
- Amsterdam. We got it.
- Amsterdam.

1171
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,780
Okay.

1172
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,310
- Isn't it fun?
- It's not fun, but it's doable.

1173
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,910
I'm a little bummed out because...

1174
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,680
- You couldn't enjoy it?
- I couldn't completely enjoy it.

1175
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,020
Having the questions made it
better for me.

1176
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,090
It made me focus.

1177
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,990
Let's go back while laughing.

1178
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,460
They look...

1179
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,730
This is good.

1180
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,460
- We saw them all.
- Nice.

1181
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,530
What are the answers?

1182
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,030
Amsterdam, Madrid, Prague.

1183
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,400
- We got them all.
- Really?

1184
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,170
You got all three correct.

1185
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,640
(All three answers are correct.)

1186
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,870
(Amsterdam)

1187
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,010
(Prague)

1188
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,370
(Madrid)

1189
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,880
(3 correct answers)

1190
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,510
- Wasn't it okay?
- It was doable.

1191
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,650
We got them all.

1192
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,250
- Good job.
- Now,

1193
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,680
I'll give 10 dollars to the 3 teams.

1194
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,020
- We earned ten dollars.
- Okay.

1195
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,220
Can all of us ride it
one last time to celebrate?

1196
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,860
Can I sit in the front?

1197
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,390
All of us together one last time.

1198
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,730
Let's sit in the front.

1199
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,460
Come on.

1200
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,130
- It's my wish.
- It'll be on camera.

1201
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,670
- Where is he?
- Sit in the very front.

1202
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,800
- Hurry up, Jong Hyun.
- They'll be filming it.

1203
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,700
- They'll be filming it.
- Get on.

1204
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,140
Hurry over here, Jong Hyun.

1205
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,140
- Okay.
- We don't have much time.

1206
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,480
(Director Joo got on
in place of Jong Min.)

1207
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,550
Joo Jong Hyun is my savior.

1208
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,020
The door is opening.

1209
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,520
- Hoya.
- Yes!

1210
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,720
- Hoya.
- Hoya.

1211
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
All right.

1212
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,420
(The examiners ride it again
because they want to.)

1213
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,860
(Making a new memory
for Hoya and Joon's anniversary)

1214
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,770
- Pose for the photo.
- We're friends!

1215
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:56,830
(A roller coaster's highlight
is taking photos.)

1216
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,870
(Roller coaster ride on Hoya
and Joon's 1st year anniversary)

1217
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,370
(Sae Ho closed his eyes.)

1218
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,400
(Jong Min, lift your head.)

1219
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,240
(30 seconds before Se Yoon's crying)

1220
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,740
(Hoya's bucket list is
a huge success.)

1221
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,580
(What's next on Hoya
and Joon's bucket list?)

1222
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,680
The weather got much better.

1223
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,850
- Isn't it fun?
- Yes.

1224
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
It's fun.

1225
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,890
Being at an amusement park
makes me feel good.

1226
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,190
Right? It makes you
feel like a child again.

1227
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,690
(Full of excitement)

1228
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,490
(2 Days and 1 Night family goes back
to being children again.)

1229
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,390
(Cute)

1230
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,430
(Adorable)

1231
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,660
Hello.

1232
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,930
Which school do you go to?

1233
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:30,930
(Students who came as a group)

1234
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,470
Hello.

1235
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,500
- Hello.
- Hi.

1236
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,810
Study hard.

1237
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,470
What's this again?

1238
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,380
- What's this?
- It's a cable car.

1239
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,410
- A cable car?
- A cable car?

1240
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,910
We must be going on a cable car.

1241
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,490
(Glancing)

1242
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,290
That's what I mentioned. It's fun.

1243
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,020
- That one?
- It's extremely fun.

1244
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,820
I can't ride that.

1245
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,830
It's really fun.

1246
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,560
A long time ago, on a music show,

1247
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,530
- I had to sing while riding that.
- What?

1248
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,460
- On a music show?
- Yes.

1249
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,500
While being on that ride.

1250
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,570
Really?

1251
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,670
(Jong Min's solo performance
14 years ago)

1252
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,370
(Stay strong, Jong Min!)

1253
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,370
(Screaming)

1254
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,010
(Boys and girls)

1255
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,310
(Singing passionately
with his eyes closed on the ride)

1256
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,680
Many singers did that back then.

1257
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,810
They performed at amusement parks
or swimming pools.

1258
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,810
- But you can't get on rides.
- No.

1259
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,950
It was very difficult.

1260
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,480
I will work hard.

1261
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,850
(Jong Min was full of passion
back then.)

1262
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,660
Get out of the cable car.

1263
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,190
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1264
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,360
Hey, guys.

1265
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,990
There's slushy.

1266
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,600
- I like that.
- Let's get some slushy.

1267
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,430
- It's really delicious.
- Let's share one.

1268
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,230
- Ask if you can get a taste.
- Oh, come on.

1269
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,130
- Go and ask.
- Hurry up.

1270
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,300
I don't have money.

1271
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,970
- There's melon flavor.
- My goodness.

1272
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,140
- Hello.
- We have no seven dollars to spend.

1273
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,080
- It's seven dollars.
- We have no money, Grandma.

1274
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,110
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

1275
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,080
Let's pick two people
for the slushy.

1276
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,710
- No way.
- Listen to me.

1277
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,350
- We have a lot more to do.
- No.

1278
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,480
- We have to save money.
- We don't have much money now.

1279
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,890
It's useless to save money
right now.

1280
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,050
Are you thirsty or not?

1281
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,620
- Just drink water.
- Drink water.

1282
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,190
- Let's enjoy ourselves.
- We have to save money.

1283
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,520
Can you pay with KakaoPay?

1284
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,860
Let's not do this.

1285
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,830
- But I want some.
- Give us more money.

1286
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:06,830
No.

1287
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,730
He has total control over the money.

1288
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,070
Let me have one.

1289
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,670
No, we have no money.

1290
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,240
Are we just going to walk all day?

1291
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,670
"Are we just going to walk?"

1292
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,410
These corn dogs are amazing.

1293
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,980
Go and ask if you can get a taste.

1294
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,210
Those corn dogs are to die for.

1295
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,540
They look delicious.

1296
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,950
They look delicious.

1297
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,950
These corn dogs are delicious.

1298
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,150
Grandma wants one cheese corn dog.

1299
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,550
Can you buy me one corn dog?

1300
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,320
- Corn dogs look delicious.
- By the way,

1301
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,860
Grandma Jong Min kept talking
about corn dogs today.

1302
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,760
Which one do you want?
A slushy or a corn dog?

1303
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,230
- Right now, I want some slushy.
- Then let's just go.

1304
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,290
No, corn dog.

1305
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,200
(A quick change in attitude)

1306
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,100
Jong Min kept saying
that he wanted it.

1307
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,230
(He finally got his wish.)

1308
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,230
All right.

1309
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,670
(Half of the corn dog disappears
in an instant.)

1310
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,410
(2 Days and 1 Night family shares it
and takes a bite each.)

1311
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,670
Give some to the son in the back.

1312
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,680
(Happiness in 5 dollars)

1313
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
(Eating)

1314
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,180
(Take a look again
for remaining crumbs.)

1315
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,780
(Glancing)

1316
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,850
Mom.

1317
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,050
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

1318
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,820
People might think that
I don't treat you well at home.

1319
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,490
- Everyone, let's get going.
- Let's go.

1320
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,930
- Goodness.
- Is everyone here?

1321
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,430
Yes, Dad.

1322
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,600
Honey, everyone is here.

1323
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,800
- That's right.
- Here we go.

1324
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,470
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

1325
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,730
Dad, please drive safely.

1326
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,270
Wasn't Hoya's bucket list nice?

1327
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:23,670
- Yes, it wasn't bad.
- I'm satisfied with it.

1328
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,470
- Yes.
- I liked it. It'd been a while.

1329
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,080
Was it difficult only for Jong Min?

1330
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,380
It was difficult.

1331
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,050
Aren't we going to do
what's on Joon's bucket list next?

1332
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,420
I'm worried about
Joon's bucket list.

1333
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,090
To be honest, I'm a little scared.

1334
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,490
- Why?
- Joon is weird too.

1335
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,290
- My beloved Joon.
- Yes?

1336
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,820
Just tell me secretly.
What did you suggest on the list?

1337
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,630
I don't remember.

1338
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,360
Shall I make you remember?

1339
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,700
How?

1340
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,330
Wait a minute.

1341
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:49,670
- Like this...
- I remember now.

1342
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,130
- You remember, don't you?
- Yes.

1343
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,130
What did you ask?

1344
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,170
First,

1345
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,900
I said that I'd like to stay
near my house.

1346
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,240
Well done.

1347
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,370
That's why we're here.

1348
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,940
- So that's why.
- I raised Joon very well.

1349
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,680
Then are we going to Joon's house?

1350
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,280
- I remember it clearly.
- What?

1351
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,950
I asked for a hotel staycation.

1352
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,380
- What?
- I asked for a hotel staycation.

1353
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,880
- I really did.
- Training or hotel?

1354
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,490
- Hotel.
- Hotel staycation.

1355
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,690
You should've pronounced
more clearly.

1356
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,820
I'm telling you the truth.

1357
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:15,790
Mr. Joo is calling me.

1358
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,160
Hello, I'm listening.

1359
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,690
Do you hear me, everyone?

1360
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:19,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

1361
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,860
Your next destination is...

1362
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,130
one of the places
on Joon's bucket list.

1363
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,140
You're going skydiving.

1364
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,740
- Don't lie.
- Seriously?

1365
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,240
You're going skydiving.

1366
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,080
Is it possible with today's weather?

1367
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:36,880
What have you done?

1368
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,180
You're going skydiving.

1369
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,950
(Frozen)

1370
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,220
- Gosh.
- Now...

1371
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,720
(Truly flustered)

1372
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,060
Seriously?

1373
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,090
- Did you really say that?
- He wanted to skydive together.

1374
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,760
Are you out of your mind?

1375
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,800
- See you when you arrive.
- I'm going to turn the car around.

1376
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,230
We're going home.

1377
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:55,530
I'm going to turn the car around.

1378
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,270
I can't do that.

1379
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,200
We're going home.

1380
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,470
- I'm going to turn the car around.
- Seriously?

1381
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,970
I don't remember mentioning it.

1382
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,110
- What have you done?
- No way.

1383
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,480
I'm sorry. Oh, no.

1384
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:10,550
- Joon, I can't skydive.
- Me neither.

1385
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,710
- Me neither.
- I just felt pain in my heart.

1386
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,720
Hey.

1387
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,850
(Extremely serious)

1388
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,820
- The weather is also bad.
- Why did you suggest it?

1389
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,290
It was my idea? I never said it.

1390
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:20,420
No way.

1391
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,620
On Joon Tour, is there something...

1392
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,530
that you absolutely want to do?

1393
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:28,300
Group skydiving for Team Joon.

1394
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,400
- You suggested skydiving?
- I never did.

1395
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
(What he said carelessly
became a reality.)

1396
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,570
What does this mean?

1397
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:35,970
I'm going to turn the car around.

1398
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,510
But we decided to humor him today.

1399
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:39,910
- What should we do?
- Dad.

1400
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,310
We can't do this just to humor him.

1401
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,410
Mom, should I turn the car around?

1402
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,850
We have to bite the bullet.

1403
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,050
What do we do?

1404
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,380
- What do I do?
- How can we skydive?

1405
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,750
No, this is wrong.

1406
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,350
I'm sorry.

1407
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,190
- What?
- What?

1408
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,190
Is this the place?

1409
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,090
(Traces of laughter
disappear instantly.)

1410
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:58,490
What's this?

1411
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,070
(Filled with questions,
they arrive.)

1412
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,240
- It feels cool in here. What?
- It's golf.

1413
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,300
Hello.

1414
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,710
What is he doing? Goodness.

1415
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,540
- What?
- What is he doing?

1416
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,110
(What's shocking the members?)

1417
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,920
- What?
- What is he doing?

1418
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,120
What is he doing? He's spinning.

1419
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,120
(Someone who's flying freely?)
He's spinning his head.

1420
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:25,650
- What?
- Gosh.

1421
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,390
- Oh, my.
- What's going on?

1422
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,290
He's playing with gravity.

1423
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,360
What's underneath him?

1424
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,890
How high does he go?

1425
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,400
(Moving freely)

1426
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,060
That's right.

1427
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,070
(A sudden fall)

1428
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,100
What?

1429
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,670
(Their hearts skip a beat.)

1430
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,340
He's bumping into the ceiling.

1431
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,940
(Indoor skydiving
that uses the wind)

1432
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,210
How is that possible?

1433
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,610
How does he fall so suddenly?

1434
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,280
It's dangerous.

1435
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,950
Something seems wrong.

1436
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,280
- Shouldn't we save him?
- He's dancing.

1437
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,820
- I think he passed out.
- Passed out?

1438
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,980
(Spinning)

1439
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,190
(Posing)

1440
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,350
(Nice to meet you.)

1441
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:03,260
(Blown away
by the incredible fan service)

1442
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,460
That's insane.

1443
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:05,990
What's going on?

1444
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:12,470
(He finishes up
with a splendid escape like a hero.)

1445
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,570
(They clap like seals
as if they were back in childhood.)

1446
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,570
(What did I just see?
I can't believe my eyes.)

1447
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:18,670
- Oh, my.
- That was awesome.

1448
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,440
- It was so scary at the end.
- How did he get out like that?

1449
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,980
- Did you see that?
- Unbelievable. How does he do that?

1450
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,610
- That was unbelievable.
- He got out and landed on his feet.

1451
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,010
- Must we do that?
- The last move was amazing.

1452
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,250
You all saw how it was done, right?

1453
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,590
- This is Joon's bucket list item.
- What's his problem?

1454
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,590
- Why is it on his bucket list?
- Let's hear him out.

1455
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,160
Did I say I wanted to try this?

1456
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,360
Is there something
that you absolutely want to do?

1457
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,060
It'd be fun
if we tried a hard challenge.

1458
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,600
For example,
we could travel to Dokdo Island...

1459
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,000
on a duck boat.

1460
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,930
Or group skydiving for Team Joon.

1461
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,900
(The thought of it alone
makes him happy.)

1462
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,970
I seriously don't remember
saying that. Trust me.

1463
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,570
It's okay. This is doable.

1464
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:50,570
Right. You're grateful to me, right?

1465
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,610
It would've been really hard
if we had to fall through the sky.

1466
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,110
- I'll introduce you to the coach.
- Okay.

1467
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,080
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1468
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,580
Please stand in the middle.
Oh, my. He looks amazing.

1469
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,650
I'm Coach Yoo Hyeon Jae.

1470
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:07,160
I'm an indoor skydiver,
and I do the freestyle,

1471
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,960
- representing Korea.
- Great.

1472
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,730
(Amazing)

1473
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,360
The wind blows upward
at the same speed.

1474
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,760
How do you fall down suddenly
while floating in the air...

1475
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,400
- and stay down?
- He soared up into the air too.

1476
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,130
With the wind blowing
at the same speed,

1477
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,770
you need to control the movements
with your body.

1478
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,200
You float
when your body is horizontal,

1479
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,240
- and you fall when it's vertical.
- So, how...

1480
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,710
- So it requires high concentration.
- You need high concentration.

1481
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,340
- You also need strong core muscles.
- Right.

1482
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,880
Can anyone try this
without a license?

1483
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,880
Yes, of course.

1484
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,810
What's the weight limit?
I don't think there's a suit that fits me.

1485
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,880
- The weight limit is...
- There's a weight limit, right?

1486
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,950
- about 120kg.
- So you can do it.

1487
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,820
- No. I weigh 122kg.
- But...

1488
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,320
I've taught someone
who weighed 130kg.

1489
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,230
I shouldn't try this though.
Aren't I right?

1490
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,760
Yes, you can do it.

1491
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,230
- Now, change your clothes.
- Okay.

1492
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,600
I feel so bad.

1493
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,070
(Se Yoon is worried,
and Joon feels bad.)

1494
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,200
Leave me alone for a moment.

1495
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,240
(Give me a moment
to get myself ready mentally.)

1496
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,270
Give me just a moment.

1497
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:56,370
Guess what I hated the most
during the four-week military training.

1498
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,670
Changing clothes.

1499
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,980
All fat men would understand.
Where did they go?

1500
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,980
They're really leaving me alone.

1501
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,010
At least they do as I ask.

1502
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,050
(Would I be able to fly?)

1503
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,820
My gosh.
I never knew I would try this.

1504
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,280
We've been trying
various activities today.

1505
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:11,450
You will watch a video first.

1506
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,420
It will show you
the steps of the training process.

1507
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,390
Watch it carefully. Now,

1508
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:19,090
you will try skydiving
in the wind tunnel, one at a time.

1509
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,060
You can gain an allowance
through this mission as well.

1510
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,700
Then we should do this.
We should do our best.

1511
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,870
The game you'll play
to gain an allowance this time is...

1512
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,600
Zero Gravity Speed Quiz.

1513
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,310
You have one minute for each round.
The member in the wind tunnel...

1514
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,840
will give questions
to the other members.

1515
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,910
The other members will stand
in a row...

1516
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,080
behind this line here.

1517
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,180
You have to read the member's lips
and guess the answer.

1518
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,420
Each of you will give questions
in the wind tunnel.

1519
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,920
So we'll have six rounds in total.

1520
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,490
Each member can pass
only one question in his turn.

1521
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,790
How should we give a signal
to pass a question?

1522
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,020
Let's move our tongues.

1523
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,760
- Let's stick out our tongues.
- Like this.

1524
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,030
- Okay.
- This time,

1525
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,660
you have to get four right answers
or more to succeed.

1526
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,770
- How much money do we get?
- Five dollars if you succeed.

1527
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:57,900
- Come on.
- That's ridiculous.

1528
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,400
If you succeed in all 6 rounds,
you'll get 30 dollars.

1529
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,670
- Oh, I see.
- Oh, five dollars for each round?

1530
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,440
(They understood they could get
5 dollars per person just now.)

1531
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,610
What if only one of us succeeds?

1532
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:05,870
Then you'll get five dollars.

1533
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,440
- Come on. That's so little.
- Oh, gosh.

1534
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,610
- This isn't the last mission.
- Are there more missions?

1535
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,150
- If this isn't the last mission...
- You won't let us have lunch?

1536
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,380
- Right. Give us food to eat first.
- When will we have lunch?

1537
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,150
Now you will start the game
one at a time.

1538
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:18,890
The session takes about two minutes.

1539
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,190
For the first minute,

1540
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,660
- you'll practice flying in there.
- We'll have time to practice.

1541
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,090
And you'll play the game
for the remaining one minute.

1542
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,090
- Okay.
- Okay.

1543
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,760
Everyone, let's go.

1544
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,860
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

1545
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,770
You think this will be scarier
than the roller coaster?

1546
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:32,770
I'm scared of both of them.

1547
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:33,840
No, I think this will be less scary.

1548
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,140
- I think it'll be much easier.
- This will be much easier.

1549
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,570
Are you sure?

1550
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:40,210
While flying in there,
keep your legs straight.

1551
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,440
And keep your arms straight as well.

1552
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,750
(He enters the wind tunnel.)

1553
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:47,420
(Nervous)

1554
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,450
Let's go and see
how ugly Sae Ho looks in there.

1555
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,450
How does he stand straight
like that?

1556
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,850
Gosh.
Let's see how ugly he'll become.

1557
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,960
My goodness.

1558
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,960
(Surprised)

1559
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,990
(His body floats in the air
in an instant.)

1560
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,990
What?

1561
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,560
(Peekaboo)

1562
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,060
(Laughing)

1563
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,530
His face looks funny in there.

1564
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:06,570
(His face looks pretty bizarre.)

1565
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,570
My gosh.

1566
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:10,170
(Shocked by his looks)

1567
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,240
(As he goes up higher,)

1568
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,480
(his cheeks flutter like a flag.)

1569
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,180
That's good. Oh, my. He's flying.

1570
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,680
(Fluttering)

1571
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,080
- What?
- What's going on?

1572
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,020
(There is no CGI on his face.)

1573
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,750
My goodness. Look at his face.

1574
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,520
- Gosh. What's that?
- Look at his face.

1575
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,660
I'm afraid
I might see that face in my dream.

1576
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:30,590
(The face you'd never want to see
in your dream)

1577
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,430
What? Don't do that.

1578
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:33,760
Look at his mouth.

1579
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,800
Ready, set, go!

1580
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,130
(The first question: Blind date)

1581
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,070
(Blind date)

1582
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:47,510
(Blind date!)

1583
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,840
- Blind date.
- Correct.

1584
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,320
(Ball-shaped candy)

1585
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,150
- Ball-shaped candy.
- Correct.

1586
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,250
- Okay.
- What?

1587
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,550
(Man)

1588
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,160
- Me?
- Cho Sae Ho.

1589
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,260
(Man!)

1590
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,330
Man.

1591
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,630
- Correct.
- Okay.

1592
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,260
(Se Yoon got three answers right
alone.)

1593
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,670
(Guess the answer.)

1594
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:11,870
- Glade.
- Sliding.

1595
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,300
- Sniks?
- Slice.

1596
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,610
(What is that?)

1597
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,070
- It's a four-letter word.
- Slime.

1598
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,140
Slate.

1599
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,810
(Frustrated)

1600
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,550
(The answer is...)

1601
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,350
(S...)

1602
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,620
(St...)

1603
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,380
(Stretch...)

1604
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,620
(Stretching)

1605
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,150
- It's a four-letter word.
- Slime.

1606
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,820
- Slate.
- No, that's not it.

1607
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:35,290
- Again. What?
- Skydiving.

1608
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:36,320
Aerobic?

1609
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,390
Stretching.

1610
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:39,690
- Correct.
- Okay.

1611
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,630
- He's good at this.
- He's spinning.

1612
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,730
What is he doing?

1613
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,170
(Eyes widening)

1614
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,310
(Soaring)

1615
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,680
(Falling down)

1616
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,380
(Frightened)

1617
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,750
Gosh. I won't do that.

1618
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,250
I won't go in there
unless he promises he won't do it.

1619
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,320
Oh, my goodness.

1620
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,650
(You should try skydiving
since you're here.)

1621
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,790
(His eyes are set on them.
That must be fun.)

1622
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,120
Is he heavier?

1623
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,720
How does he do that?

1624
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,160
I really hate it.

1625
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,590
- Is someone else up there?
- It's too high.

1626
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:14,630
(He's trying to get out now.)

1627
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:16,330
- What's that?
- What's going on? What's he doing?

1628
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,070
(He's not a drunken man
being dragged out.)

1629
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,100
What?

1630
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,000
- I think it'll be fun.
- It's more like a funny act.

1631
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,870
- Our faces will all look funny.
- We'll make people laugh.

1632
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,140
- My gosh. That was so fun.
- Are you all right?

1633
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,140
I really enjoyed it.

1634
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,150
(The unexpected adrenaline rush
satisfied him.)

1635
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:31,450
I'll come back here for another try.

1636
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,210
That was amazing.

1637
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,620
Can I not go up higher than this?

1638
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,320
- It's too high.
- You can do it.

1639
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,920
If I fall down,
I won't let it slide.

1640
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,220
- How many answers did you get?
- We got all the questions right.

1641
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,260
Really?

1642
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,890
Sae Ho,
you're blessed with your face.

1643
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,160
- This is how you looked.
- I know what you mean.

1644
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,230
You know what I'm saying, right?

1645
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:50,070
- It was so fun. It was amazing.
- Was it fun?

1646
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,300
The second member is getting ready.

1647
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,270
With such a strong wind like that...

1648
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,840
(He enters with the coach's help.)

1649
00:53:58,670 --> 00:53:59,740
Hey. What?

1650
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,180
- He looks so ugly.
- My gosh.

1651
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,410
Why is he smiling?

1652
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,580
- He must be enjoying it.
- Right.

1653
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,950
But why does he open his mouth
like that?

1654
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,720
(He got scared by the sudden turn.)

1655
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,720
That's possible because he's light.
I don't think I'm able to do that.

1656
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:13,720
He looks so cute.

1657
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,260
He looks like a hamster.

1658
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,730
Ready, set, go!

1659
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,530
(Elephant)

1660
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,130
- What is it? What?
- Nose?

1661
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,260
- Right. Nose.
- Pinocchio.

1662
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,670
- Pinocchio.
- Pinocchio.

1663
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,570
- Elephant.
- Correct. "Elephant" is correct.

1664
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,100
- It's hot.
- You're scared. It's hot.

1665
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,770
- Fan?
- Heat wave.

1666
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,240
Correct. "Heat wave" is correct.

1667
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,740
- He's so good at this. I can't...
- How many letters?

1668
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,410
- Look at him.
- It's a mountain.

1669
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:36,410
(He describes a mountain.)

1670
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,710
The Himalayas.

1671
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,310
- The Himalayas.
- Correct. You got three right.

1672
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,120
(They only have to get
one more question right to succeed.)

1673
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,020
(Flustered)

1674
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,520
- What's with him?
- What? Look at his face.

1675
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:48,620
- Knucklehead.
- He looks so ugly. I can't guess.

1676
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,060
- Head? Egg.
- I don't understand what it means.

1677
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,860
- Egg.
- Stone-grilled egg.

1678
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,460
- Sand lance.
- He looks like a different person.

1679
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,460
Sand lance coffee.

1680
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,570
(Frustrated)

1681
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,800
(The answer...)

1682
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,540
(is yolk.)

1683
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,910
- Sand lance coffee.
- Yolk.

1684
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,040
"Yolk" is correct.

1685
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,610
(They got four questions right
and completed the mission.)

1686
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:09,710
Oh, gosh.

1687
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:11,180
- I just hate it.
- Look at his face.

1688
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,380
(He's surprised
as his body goes up suddenly.)

1689
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,480
I really hate it.

1690
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,820
It looks so scary.

1691
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,350
(With the additional 5 dollars,
they gained 10 dollars so far.)

1692
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,750
We got the questions right, though.

1693
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:20,460
(You can leave now.)

1694
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,460
DinDin, turn around.

1695
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:23,960
(He looks as if he were on top
of Mount Everest.)

1696
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,530
I think he walked that way
on top of Mount Halla.

1697
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,560
The wind was blowing strongly,
so we had to walk that way.

1698
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,170
- He managed to walk out.
- He must be good at it.

1699
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,000
DinDin, was it fun?
You seemed to enjoy it.

1700
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:35,040
It's not scary at all.

1701
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,540
It feels like there's a big fan
under your feet.

1702
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,470
I was scared at first,
but later on...

1703
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,780
- It was fun, right?
- Yes, it was fun.

1704
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,040
I'll show you how you looked.

1705
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,880
(He teases DinDin
when he has the chance.)

1706
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,820
- You did well. We got it all.
- You really looked like this.

1707
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,950
Who's up next?

1708
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,280
- Jong Min, you've got this.
- Kim Jong Min!

1709
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,620
I'll escort him and come back.

1710
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:53,050
- I'll go by myself.
- He's been the cast for 18 years.

1711
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:55,520
He'll fly in the air.
Here goes Kim Jong Min!

1712
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,030
(Will the scaredy-cat oldest member
be able to do well?)

1713
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,330
- Guys.
- Yes?

1714
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:00,530
Since you guys did so well,

1715
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:02,160
we added a longer word
to the questions.

1716
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,330
Okay. That's fine.

1717
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:04,870
Is it wrong that we did well?

1718
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,100
No, it's good that you did well.

1719
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,140
But it'll be even better...

1720
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,340
- if there's more suspense.
- Seon Ho.

1721
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,270
- That was the right question.
- Right?

1722
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,040
Why would they raise the difficulty
when we did well?

1723
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,280
- Go, Jong Min!
- Jong Min, you've got this!

1724
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,480
(Screaming)

1725
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:18,150
I'm scared to look down there.

1726
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,420
(He saw where the wind comes from
and got scared.)

1727
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,720
- Don't look down. Face forward.
- Got it.

1728
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,190
(Stiff)

1729
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:30,060
(Extremely nervous)

1730
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,730
- What?
- Jong Min, you can do it!

1731
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,190
Jong Min looks
like a different person.

1732
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,830
That's what he'd look like
15 years from now.

1733
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,330
Is he perhaps a different person?

1734
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,070
Go, Jong Min!

1735
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:39,770
Jong Min must be nervous.

1736
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:40,900
I'm worried about him.

1737
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,040
Once he overcomes his fear,
he'll be okay.

1738
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,670
(Leaning on the coach,
he carefully lowers his body.)

1739
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,170
That's good. Okay.

1740
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,740
He's doing well.
He's doing unexpectedly well.

1741
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,980
- What?
- What?

1742
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,050
He's enjoying it.

1743
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:54,020
(Smiling happily)

1744
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,080
He's doing really well.

1745
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,350
- He's good at it.
- What?

1746
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,190
- He's good at it.
- He's the best among us so far.

1747
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,660
- He's the best among us so far.
- He's good at it.

1748
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:01,920
He's better than the other two.

1749
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,160
(Excited)

1750
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,090
- He's doing so well.
- Indeed.

1751
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,360
I knew he would do well.

1752
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,630
All right. We'll begin now.

1753
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:09,700
Start.

1754
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,330
Is he saying...

1755
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:14,340
(Gaping)

1756
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:18,810
- Pizza.
- Pizza.

1757
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:19,840
Pizza.

1758
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,610
- Water parsley.
- Water parsley.

1759
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,780
(The answer is...)

1760
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:26,310
(Killer move)

1761
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,720
- Water parsley.
- It's water parsley.

1762
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,720
(It looks like he's saying
"water parsley" at a glance.)

1763
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,620
- Water parsley.
- Slug.

1764
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,820
Slug.

1765
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:32,820
(Killer move)

1766
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:35,520
- Icy road.
- Let's pass.

1767
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,560
Okay, pass.

1768
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,790
(The next one
is a five-letter word.)

1769
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:42,230
(Ox head soup)

1770
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:43,530
- Beef tripe.
- Beef tripe.

1771
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,030
Ox head meat and rice soup.

1772
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,900
(Ox head soup)

1773
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,300
(It's a soup.)

1774
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,300
What is he saying?

1775
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,610
- You have ten seconds.
- Ox bone tripes?

1776
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,710
- Oxtail soup?
- Oxtail soup with rice.

1777
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,710
Ox head rice soup.

1778
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,480
- We'll never get it.
- Three, two...

1779
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,180
- Ox head soup.
- Correct.

1780
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,650
- Time is up.
- What's this?

1781
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,790
- The questions were horrible.
- I know.

1782
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:06,390
(Flying up)

1783
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,060
(Jong Min becomes a scaredy-cat
as he is scared of this.)

1784
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,560
- He's good at this.
- Right.

1785
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,790
He's actually good at this.

1786
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:12,890
(Laughing)

1787
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,700
(Trying hard to survive)

1788
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,730
What's going on?

1789
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,930
(He's almost like a drunk man.)

1790
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,870
He seems drunk there.

1791
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:23,500
He won't let go.

1792
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,540
Goodness.

1793
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:25,910
What's happening?
(Tottering to get out)

1794
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:29,180
- What's wrong with him?
- It's hilarious.

1795
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:30,880
(Sighing)

1796
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,150
(You did a good job.)

1797
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:33,620
Okay, thank you.

1798
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,080
That wasn't so bad.

1799
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,990
(I can't believe that I made it.)

1800
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,820
Gosh, I'm drooling all over...

1801
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,520
- It wasn't scary, was it?
- It was actually fun.

1802
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,590
I told you.

1803
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:44,890
- It was fun.
- Let me help you with this.

1804
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,590
Give him a round of applause.

1805
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,030
- How was it?
- It's actually nice.

1806
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,400
- It's nice?
- It's better than I thought.

1807
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,230
The man grabbed Sae Ho and me.

1808
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,970
- But he let go of you.
- You did it all by yourself.

1809
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:56,270
- You did it yourself.
- Well done.

1810
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:58,270
You finally got to prove
your gymnastics skills today.

1811
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:01,110
I think I can do it all by myself
after a few attempts.

1812
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:02,740
- Really?
- Yes, I think I can do it.

1813
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:05,350
Let's go!

1814
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,520
Seon Ho could fly with a fan.

1815
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,550
He's in it now. There he goes.

1816
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,320
- Paper Doll.
- Here comes Paper Doll.

1817
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,550
(Fluttering)

1818
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,820
What's going on?

1819
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,490
That's how he does it.

1820
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:17,990
- He's too light.
- He'll fly away.

1821
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,830
Maybe it's because he's too skinny.

1822
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:21,430
He can't balance himself.

1823
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,560
- His arms look awkward there.
- Let's go.

1824
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,930
Ready? Start.

1825
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:31,770
What is he saying?

1826
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,010
Buldak ramyeon?

1827
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,310
Buldak.

1828
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,050
(It's a type of food.)

1829
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,820
Something grilled...

1830
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,920
Is it something grilled?

1831
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,350
It's tteokbokki.

1832
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,550
Yeopgi tteokbokki?

1833
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,690
It's something grilled...

1834
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,020
- Grilled tteokbokki.
- Thai curry crab?

1835
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,230
That is correct!

1836
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,230
Great.

1837
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,000
(Here is the second question.)

1838
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,700
(Sunday)

1839
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:57,730
Is he saying...

1840
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,130
An elephant.

1841
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:00,800
Lee Hyo Ri.

1842
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,870
- Pass.
- Pass.

1843
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:06,540
What?

1844
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,380
Canine tooth.

1845
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,680
- Correct.
- It's a canine tooth.

1846
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:10,750
He's good.

1847
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,010
(He has about 10 seconds.)

1848
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,010
Is that correct?

1849
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,020
(It's a two-letter word.)

1850
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,020
What is it?

1851
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,620
(A telephone)

1852
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:19,820
(Save...)

1853
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,490
(Saving)

1854
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:24,590
- Jeonnam?
- Reduction?

1855
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,630
(Saving)

1856
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:29,560
- To bow down?
- Three,

1857
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,200
- two, one.
- Transfer.

1858
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,840
(Mission failed)

1859
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,840
What's going on? He's going up.

1860
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,400
He's going up again.

1861
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,610
(Excited)

1862
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,810
(Going up straight
to a high altitude)

1863
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,080
(It's fun.)

1864
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,510
He almost got dragged out.

1865
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:52,490
(Being dragged out)

1866
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,360
(This is what he wanted
as it was on his bucket list.)

1867
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,900
He looks so confident there.

1868
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,130
(Joon is going to rock this game.)

1869
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:09,700
(This familiar tension)

1870
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:12,170
(This is it.)

1871
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:16,180
(I know how to do it right.)

1872
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,680
I think I can do better than him.

1873
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,850
Joon looks different
even with his pose.

1874
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:20,250
He's going forward.

1875
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,050
There he goes.

1876
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,290
(Getting up without any help)

1877
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,560
(Flying up in a cool manner)

1878
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,690
(Flying in a stable position)

1879
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,800
(I think I'm good at this.)

1880
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,270
He got it.

1881
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:38,700
(Make them a heart.)

1882
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:40,840
A heart.

1883
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:44,370
- He's ready.
- Please rock this game.

1884
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:45,740
He can't hear me, can he?

1885
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,680
Start.

1886
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,150
(Stone flicking)

1887
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,220
- Stone flicking.
- Stone flicking.

1888
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,450
Correct.

1889
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:57,690
(A whistle)

1890
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,420
What is it?

1891
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,660
- A whistle.
- A whistle.

1892
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,390
(Calf)

1893
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,390
(This part right here)

1894
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,930
Calf.

1895
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:09,230
Correct.

1896
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:12,830
- Piggyback.
- Piggyback.

1897
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,340
- That is correct.
- We got it.

1898
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,440
(He got 4 questions right
in just 30 seconds.)

1899
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,840
(Joon is good.)

1900
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,250
His legs...

1901
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:27,180
Teeth.

1902
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:29,450
- Molar tooth.
- It's a...

1903
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,650
party.

1904
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,720
- Bracelet.
- Bracelet.

1905
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,990
Arms? Muscles.

1906
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,860
Biceps?

1907
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,960
What is it?

1908
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:40,430
(You poke it on your bottoms.)

1909
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:41,460
- Bottoms.
- Bottoms.

1910
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,600
- Two, one...
- Vaccination.

1911
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,600
- Time is up.
- BCG vaccine.

1912
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,830
What is he doing?

1913
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,340
(Let's go,
it's show time in the air.)

1914
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,770
(Enjoying skydiving up and down)

1915
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:54,410
How do we do that?

1916
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:58,550
(Joon completed his mission
by getting four questions.)

1917
01:02:58,550 --> 01:02:59,980
Se Yoon, it's your turn.

1918
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:00,980
Let's go, Se Yoon.

1919
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,550
- I'll be back.
- Go, Se Yoon!

1920
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:03,990
- Will I be okay?
- Sure.

1921
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,650
You can do this. Let's go.

1922
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,420
Okay, thank you.

1923
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,490
(The last player is Se Yoon
who weighs 120kg.)

1924
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,460
I can't wait to see this.

1925
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,200
I think the coach will go down
with Se Yoon.

1926
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:16,800
Can he do this?

1927
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,000
Se Yoon surely is big.

1928
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,700
Don't spread your arms.
Put your arms together like this.

1929
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:25,140
My arms like this?

1930
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,510
(Checking his posture)

1931
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,280
(Power up)

1932
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,350
(It isn't easy even for the coach.)

1933
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:42,090
(Can he fly in a cool manner?)

1934
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,120
Goodness.

1935
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:45,790
Goodness.

1936
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:47,860
(Laughing)

1937
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:49,200
It's all going into his nose.

1938
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:50,930
What's happening?

1939
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,770
(Se Yoon...)

1940
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:55,270
(is flying.)

1941
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,110
(Laughing)

1942
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,450
(Se Yoon's cheeks flying)

1943
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,420
(Se Yoon's excited.)

1944
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:08,880
Gosh, that man who weighs
120kg is in the air now.

1945
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:13,290
(My friend is the best.)

1946
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:17,390
(Se Yoon finds it surprising
himself.)

1947
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:21,160
That man who weighs 120kg
is in the air now.

1948
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,270
Gosh, he's in the air.

1949
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,570
(Smiling)

1950
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,800
- Goodness, the coach...
- He can't control Se Yoon.

1951
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:32,040
(Se Yoon keeps sinking
due to his weight.)

1952
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,470
He keeps sinking.

1953
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:36,040
He's 30kg heavier than us.

1954
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,750
(Sir, I'm sinking.)

1955
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,150
He's sinking.

1956
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:41,450
- He can't go up.
- The coach can't fly him up.

1957
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:43,380
The coach can't control this.

1958
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,090
(No, generate more power.)

1959
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:49,190
He wants to increase power.

1960
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:50,290
(The wind power is going up.)

1961
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:53,060
(He finally got to balance himself.)

1962
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,330
Let's go now. Ready.

1963
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,060
Hold on a second.

1964
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,300
His goggles...

1965
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,040
Let's go now.

1966
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,400
(His goggles slowly went up
to cover his eyes.)

1967
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,840
(Flying away)

1968
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,940
Hold on a second.

1969
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,410
(He lost his goggles
because his cheeks pushed them up.)

1970
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:10,880
(Unbelievable)

1971
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,450
(Let's get outside.)

1972
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:16,550
(Why is he so funny?)

1973
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:17,650
His goggles are gone.

1974
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:22,390
(Help me.)

1975
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,790
(His goggles were removed
due to the heavy wind.)

1976
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:28,900
(The coach puts on goggles
for Se Yoon.)

1977
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,430
He had to put them on tightly.

1978
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,700
My goodness.

1979
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,000
This is something
you rarely see on TV.

1980
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,540
We'll start right away
when he gets in.

1981
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:36,870
(We'll start the game
as soon as he gets inside.)

1982
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,210
(Se Yoon enters again
after reading himself again.)

1983
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,810
He's so ready.

1984
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,580
Let's start.

1985
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,380
Ready? Go.

1986
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,850
(Dopamine)

1987
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:53,350
- Dopamine.
- Correct.

1988
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,890
(Toilet)

1989
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:58,460
- Toilet.
- Correct.

1990
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,160
(He gets two correct
in a short period of time.)

1991
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,160
Penguin.

1992
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,900
(Mackerel)

1993
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,530
- Squid.
- Squid.

1994
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:07,540
Study dormitory.

1995
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,100
(Pass)

1996
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,110
- Pass.
- Pass.

1997
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,440
(They answered two correctly.)

1998
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:19,580
(BLACKPINK)

1999
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,850
Implant.

2000
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,120
Ribs with soybean sprouts.

2001
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,790
Ribs with soybean sprouts.

2002
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:26,220
Brazil.

2003
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:29,360
(BLACKPINK)

2004
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:33,430
(BLACKPINK)

2005
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,530
BLACKPINK?

2006
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,770
- BLACKPINK!
- Correct!

2007
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,570
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

2008
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:42,640
Ten seconds!

2009
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,240
(Ice)

2010
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,610
- Carp?
- Ice!

2011
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,710
Correct!

2012
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:48,210
- Amazing.
- He got it right.

2013
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:51,050
- Three, two, one.
- Letter.

2014
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,310
- Time over.
- We have four.

2015
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,180
(It's time to go up.)

2016
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:58,950
(Wind strength at full power)

2017
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,720
Will it work?

2018
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,720
It's working.

2019
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,560
(Let's fly.)

2020
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:07,190
Se Yoon is flying.

2021
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:10,660
(Up in the air)

2022
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:14,240
(Se Yoon flies up.)

2023
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:15,970
Se Yoon is flying.

2024
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,670
Amazing.

2025
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:20,070
- Amazing.
- Goodness.

2026
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:29,480
(I want to fly
and embrace the night sky)

2027
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,130
Goodness.

2028
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:43,900
Se Yoon looks proud.

2029
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,630
It must have been hard
for the instructor.

2030
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:49,800
(Struggling)

2031
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:51,470
Amazing!

2032
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,640
I couldn't see anything.

2033
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,510
- Instructor.
- You did very well.

2034
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:02,950
(Se Yoon made it
through the hardship.)

2035
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,820
You're really amazing.

2036
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:09,960
My mouth was...

2037
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,130
- Right.
- It affected you more.

2038
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,730
- Well done.
- Well done.

2039
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,360
- Se Yoon.
- Was it all right?

2040
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,630
- How do you feel?
- Jong Min got all the answers.

2041
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:20,670
Jong Min did? That's my best friend.

2042
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:22,270
- Of course.
- How was it?

2043
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,710
He has double eyelids now.

2044
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,510
Before announcing the results,

2045
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:28,980
- let's thank the instructor first.
- Okay.

2046
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,110
That was really amazing.

2047
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,880
- You lifted Se Yoon.
- Instructor Yoo Hyeon Jae.

2048
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,750
- I remember his name.
- You're a little giant.

2049
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:37,120
Thank you so much.

2050
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,790
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2051
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:41,060
In Zero Gravity Speed Quiz,

2052
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:44,330
DinDin, Sae Ho, Joon,
and Se Yoon succeeded.

2053
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:47,290
I said you'll be given
five dollars each.

2054
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,500
- Twenty dollars.
- You'll get twenty dollars.

2055
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,400
- Okay.
- Here you go.

2056
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,570
Let's move to the place
where we'll eat.

2057
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:55,200
- How much do we have?
- Do we have 37 dollars?

2058
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,770
It's not that much. The corn dog...

2059
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,110
Well...

2060
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,140
We might have an animal quiz
with Joon.

2061
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,110
- Right. There would be something.
- Yes.

2062
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:04,950
- Shall we get changed?
- Yes. Get changed.

2063
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:06,210
- Okay.
- Get changed.

2064
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,080
- It was fun.
- I couldn't open my eyes at all.

2065
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:09,980
I couldn't open my eyes.

2066
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,050
I felt like I was flying.

2067
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:15,190
It was quite fun.

2068
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:16,890
Yes. It was fun.

2069
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,260
It's a Grab and Kill Tour.

2070
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,900
What did we grab?

2071
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,200
It's about killing us.

2072
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,670
We should grab laughter.

2073
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:26,870
A few of us grabbed laughter.

2074
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,200
Sae Ho grabbed laughter
with his face.

2075
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,470
- Right.
- I was actually shocked.

2076
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:33,070
My face looked so funny.

2077
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:36,410
You can't beat
people who were born funny.

2078
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:39,180
- He was born with it.
- The physique is different.

2079
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,610
You'll get into trouble
if you try to imitate that.

2080
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,680
I'm hungry.

2081
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:45,420
I'm so hungry.

2082
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,420
If we eat until we're full now,
we'll get a blood sugar spike.

2083
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,290
- Right away.
- I want to eat ramyeon.

2084
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:53,630
- I'm craving ramyeon.
- I want to eat ramyeon.

2085
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:55,700
- Let's eat ramyeon.
- Since it's raining,

2086
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,100
I just want to eat ramyeon.

2087
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,170
Ramyeon is nice.

2088
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:59,500
- Ramyeon.
- And kimchi.

2089
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,240
How many ramyeon packs
do you make for six people?

2090
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,000
- About 9?
- We should make at least 9.

2091
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,710
- Ten?
- If we're going to make nine,

2092
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:07,010
let's put ten eggs.

2093
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:09,480
- Okay.
- Green onions too.

2094
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,780
(I want some ramyeon.)

2095
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,550
Chicken and seafood soup?
That's nice.

2096
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:17,550
That's nice.

2097
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,920
Restaurants with rivers are great.

2098
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:21,890
I don't have energy.

2099
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:25,830
This place is very unique.

2100
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,160
The building looks new,
and there's a river next to it.

2101
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,960
It looks just like it.

2102
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:31,770
Our first shooting.

2103
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,570
People are inside.
I guess it's okay.

2104
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,100
You can't put your feet inside
if the water is cold.

2105
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:39,670
(The members
enter the water one by one.)

2106
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:41,080
Let's go inside.

2107
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,340
(The members
enter the water one by one.)

2108
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,450
It's cold! It's no joke.

2109
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:46,510
It's refreshing.

2110
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,350
- This isn't cold.
- Goodness.

2111
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,480
Goodness.

2112
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,450
(They're whining more
than last year.)

2113
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:53,520
Why is the water so cold?

2114
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:56,290
(They all enter the river
while screaming.)

2115
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,390
(Whining)

2116
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:59,260
- Do you remember eating lunch...
- It's the same.

2117
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:00,660
in the river at the first shooting?

2118
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,000
- I remember.
- Yes.

2119
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,630
Braised spicy chicken
with aged kimchi.

2120
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:05,800
Joon was very hungry back then.

2121
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,400
Don't they sell
soy sauce marinated crab here?

2122
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:10,640
Thinking back
on that day one year ago,

2123
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,510
we decided to have lunch...

2124
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,480
- in the river.
- Nice!

2125
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,580
Nice!

2126
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:18,850
Joon talked a lot
about the memories of the river.

2127
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:22,220
He said we should have lunch late
like last time.

2128
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,280
Why did you do that?

2129
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,750
- So...
- I didn't say that.

2130
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:27,490
- Wasn't it someone else?
- I didn't say that.

2131
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:29,260
They recorded the call.

2132
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:30,360
Really?

2133
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,090
- Why doesn't he remember...
- Why did you say that?

2134
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:33,130
what he said?

2135
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:35,900
Similar to when we first came,

2136
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:39,370
we could go to a river...

2137
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:42,500
and eat around the time we ate
last time.

2138
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:47,070
I think that would go well
with the show's identity.

2139
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:50,110
(So we prepared lunch a bit late.)

2140
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,010
- I'm sorry.
- Currently,

2141
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:54,450
the money you collected...

2142
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:57,080
- Isn't it 37 dollars?
- is 37 dollars. That's right.

2143
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,990
- I'll give you the menu card.
- Okay.

2144
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:01,260
(2 Days and 1 Night menu)

2145
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,860
It doesn't make sense.

2146
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,190
What's this?

2147
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:05,260
(He saw the price of chicken
and seafood soup, 120 dollars.)

2148
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:07,960
Hey. Chicken and seafood soup?

2149
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:10,500
It costs more than 100 dollars?

2150
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,530
(They only have 37 dollars. How will
they have chicken and seafood soup?)

2151
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:14,030
This is too expensive.

2152
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:15,540
Are you trying to irritate us
or what?

2153
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,870
Don't give up.

2154
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:20,170
This is the last mission
you can earn your allowance.

2155
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,380
It's Guess Who in the River again.

2156
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:25,980
We can do it.

2157
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,920
You will see the picture
and say the name...

2158
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,350
and one of the person's works...

2159
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:31,720
in three seconds.

2160
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,820
(Jeon Do Yeon!)

2161
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:36,190
("Secret Sunshine")

2162
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:39,130
(This will be a correct answer.)

2163
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:42,430
You have five chances.

2164
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,030
If you succeed
in your first attempt,

2165
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:47,800
- you'll get 100 dollars.
- Okay.

2166
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,970
We'd barely eat
the chicken and seafood soup.

2167
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:53,170
Every time you fail,
20 dollars will be deducted.

2168
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:54,310
Let's do this.

2169
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,240
Who wants to go first?

2170
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,080
- Joon.
- Joon.

2171
01:12:58,780 --> 01:12:59,910
- It won't come here.
- Everyone.

2172
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,280
- I'm good.
- We'll go back to the basics...

2173
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:05,550
- and time precisely.
- Okay.

2174
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:06,950
- Are you ready, Joon?
- Yes.

2175
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:07,960
We'll start.

2176
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:10,590
One, two, three. Three!

2177
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,330
Three!

2178
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,860
Byun Yo Han, "Mr. Sunshine."

2179
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,760
- Joon.
- He's good.

2180
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,760
- Correct!
- I was confused.

2181
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,670
One, two, three.

2182
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:21,270
- Three, two, one!
- Goodness!

2183
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:22,370
Nam Joo Hyuk.

2184
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,100
- Wrong.
- Nam Joo Hyuk!

2185
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,640
Isn't that right?

2186
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,110
You failed the first attempt.

2187
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:28,780
(Screaming)

2188
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:30,040
(They all splash water on Se Yoon.)

2189
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,080
Wait.

2190
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:37,120
(He gets splashed instead.)

2191
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,590
What are you doing?
Why are you doing it to me?

2192
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:41,360
- He went behind you.
- He went behind.

2193
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,760
I got it correct.

2194
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,830
I'm not that good these days.

2195
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:45,890
Something's wrong.

2196
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,760
- Should I go there?
- Let's switch places.

2197
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:50,260
They've become old too.

2198
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,670
You should know right away.

2199
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,970
(The weakest two members
are sent to the end.)

2200
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,940
- This place is better.
- Okay. Let's go.

2201
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,870
- Okay.
- What?

2202
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,440
- We'll start from Joon.
- Okay.

2203
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:01,980
- We'll start.
- Joon is the ace.

2204
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,240
- Joon is good.
- Joon is good.

2205
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,610
One, two, three.

2206
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:07,950
- Who is it?
- Three,

2207
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:09,020
- Moon Geun Young.
- two,

2208
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:10,850
- one!
- This is hard.

2209
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:12,190
(Moon Geun Young)

2210
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:13,990
(The ace doesn't know.)

2211
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:15,320
- This is...
- You failed.

2212
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,860
You're amazing.

2213
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:18,260
You splashed water on me earlier.

2214
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:19,260
(He gets showered with water
2 times in a row.)

2215
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:20,830
Do it well.

2216
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,800
Are we going to do it again
when we're this bad at it?

2217
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:25,930
I'm not joking. I'm confident
it will not come all the way here.

2218
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:27,770
This is annoying.

2219
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:29,200
- Why did I get it wrong?
- It's doable.

2220
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,240
(They lost 40 dollars
in an instant.)

2221
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,870
(They all lost their motivation.)

2222
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:33,970
Let's go!

2223
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:37,210
(They don't respond.)

2224
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,880
Seriously.

2225
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,820
There's no excitement at all.

2226
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,080
This is amazing.

2227
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,890
- I'm sorry.
- Let's bring some excitement!

2228
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:46,950
- Okay!
- Okay.

2229
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:48,620
- Let's start.
- Let's go!

2230
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:50,060
(It's already their third attempt.)

2231
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:52,660
One, two, three.

2232
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:54,830
- Three.
- Yang Dong Geun, "Squid Game."

2233
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:57,160
- Two.
- Correct.

2234
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,930
(It's Sae Ho,
the second ace's turn.)

2235
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:01,000
One, two, three.

2236
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,740
Park Seo Jun, "Itaewon Class."

2237
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,140
- Nice.
- Correct.

2238
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,910
I'm in trouble.
It shouldn't come to me.

2239
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:08,180
- The face...
- I can't think.

2240
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:09,940
One, two, three.

2241
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:11,780
Three, two,

2242
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:13,210
- one.
- Jung Hae In,

2243
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,250
"Something in the Rain."

2244
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,580
- That's right.
- Correct!

2245
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:16,780
- Okay. It's correct.
- It's correct.

2246
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,650
- I'm in trouble.
- It starts now.

2247
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:20,820
- One, two, three.
- I'm in trouble.

2248
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:22,920
Three, two,

2249
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,160
- one!
- Shin Ye Eun, "The Glory!"

2250
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,590
- Correct!
- Good!

2251
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:28,630
(Good! This is doable.)

2252
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:29,960
Let's switch places.

2253
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,000
- No.
- Please switch with me.

2254
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,070
(The two weakest members are left.)

2255
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:35,000
- No.
- Just guess two correctly.

2256
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,040
Give us old-time actors.

2257
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,010
- Three, two,
- Lee Dong Hwi,

2258
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:40,370
- one.
- "Reply, 19..."

2259
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:41,840
- "Reply 19?"
- "Reply 199..."

2260
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,080
Four.

2261
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,110
(Ventriloquism?)

2262
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,920
- Four.
- Don't say anything, DinDin.

2263
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,480
Don't say anything, DinDin.

2264
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,550
I don't know.

2265
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,850
- Three!
- "Reply 1994."

2266
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:53,750
- It's 1998.
- Wrong!

2267
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,190
- My goodness.
- It's 1998.

2268
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:56,260
He...

2269
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,460
(It's understandable
to feel wronged.)

2270
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,490
Hold on.

2271
01:15:58,490 --> 01:15:59,590
(It's understandable
to feel wronged.)

2272
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:02,500
- Hey!
- Look at him.

2273
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,670
- I...
- Are you serious?

2274
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,170
(When elephants fight,
it is Joon who suffers.)

2275
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:14,570
- We can't get wet!
- Stop!

2276
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:17,210
Hold on. I feel wronged.

2277
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:18,910
Yoo Seon Ho cheated.

2278
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:20,780
- Everyone,
- I cheated.

2279
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:23,450
The audio team is on watch again.

2280
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:26,090
- He cheated this time.
- If an illegal act is detected...

2281
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:27,550
An illegal top?

2282
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:28,790
If an illegal act is detected...

2283
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:30,060
- An illegal top?
- Yes.

2284
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,960
- An illegal top?
- What is an illegal top?

2285
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:34,360
Come out, legendary top!
Illegal Top!

2286
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:37,060
Super Grand Illegal Top!

2287
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,770
We'll start with Jong Min this time.

2288
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,340
- I want to go to the middle.
- No. Don't change spots.

2289
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:43,340
I was going to do that
but it came out differently.

2290
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,240
- What are you doing?
- Let's switch spots.

2291
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:47,140
- Just stay here once.
- I'll do it for you.

2292
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:49,210
You didn't even get a single shot.
Hurry up and do it.

2293
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,410
You didn't get a single shot
on your own.

2294
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:53,180
Hurry up and do it.

2295
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,480
(The first individual shot
in the valley)

2296
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,550
Sit down.

2297
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:56,820
Please choose someone
who knows the answers.

2298
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:00,650
You have failed three times.

2299
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:03,220
If you succeed this time,
you will receive 40 dollars.

2300
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,490
Each person can eat a serving
of pork cutlet with 40 dollars.

2301
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:08,100
- Right.
- Right. Let's go and eat.

2302
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,100
- Will you try it like this then?
- Okay. We'll do it like that.

2303
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,000
The person who knows the answer
will say the answer and move away.

2304
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,430
- Okay.
- Okay.

2305
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,770
- Okay!
- Okay!

2306
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,670
Leave the easy ones for us. Got it?

2307
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:18,710
Okay.

2308
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:20,440
What are the shows
with Hwang Jung Min in them?

2309
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,580
Hwang Jung Min?

2310
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,840
- We'll start.
- "You Are My Sunshine."

2311
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,110
- "New World" and "Veteran."
- "Veteran."

2312
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,150
"Narco-Saints."

2313
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:26,150
Right. There's "Narco-Saints" too.

2314
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:29,980
We'll start. One, two, three,

2315
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,820
- go! Three...
- All right.

2316
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,220
(Hwang Jung Min,
who they just talked about, appears!)

2317
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,190
(All eyes are on Jong Min.)

2318
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,490
(He doesn't have an answer
right after talking about him?)

2319
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:40,960
- One!
- Sae Ho! "Veteran," Hwang Jung Min.

2320
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,430
- Okay.
- We just talked about him.

2321
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:43,960
- We just talked about him.
- You must say it in three seconds.

2322
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,600
- I forgot.
- How could you forget that?

2323
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,570
- Are you serious?
- I can't believe this guy.

2324
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:48,770
All right.

2325
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:50,600
I'll go if I know the answer.

2326
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,110
One, two, three, go!

2327
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:54,110
- DinDin!
- Three...

2328
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,740
Shin Min A, "Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha."

2329
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:57,240
- Okay.
- Okay.

2330
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:58,380
Nice one.

2331
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,410
- Correct.
- I said I was going to go first.

2332
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:02,080
All right. One, two, three, go!

2333
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,220
- Go for it, Moon Se Yoon!
- Three, two...

2334
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,590
Go for it, Moon Se Yoon!

2335
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:07,820
(He doesn't know the answer.)

2336
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:09,090
- Who is that?
- Two...

2337
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,260
- Go for it.
- Seon Ho.

2338
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:11,260
Park Bo Young,
"Our Unwritten Seoul."

2339
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,260
- Correct!
- Hurry up and answer.

2340
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,430
- Give me some time.
- All right.

2341
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:16,260
One, two, three, go!

2342
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:18,770
- Three, two, one.
- Go first.

2343
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:19,870
It's Park Bo Young.

2344
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:21,470
(Sae Ho...)

2345
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:23,470
(and Joon don't know the answer.)

2346
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,210
- One.
- It's Park Bo Young.

2347
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:26,940
You know that show, right?

2348
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:28,910
Oh, gosh! Come on!

2349
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,280
Wrong!

2350
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:31,950
I've seen her.

2351
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:33,680
- "Seo Young, My Daughter?"
- Right.

2352
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,280
(Just get splashed by water.)

2353
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,350
- I didn't answer on purpose.
- Gosh, this is disappointing.

2354
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:40,550
- So disappointing.
- Isn't that Lee Bo Young?

2355
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:42,820
- Right.
- Why call her Park Bo Young?

2356
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:44,590
You should've stayed still
if you didn't know the answer.

2357
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:45,760
Why try to answer it?

2358
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,690
I was in that show with her.

2359
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:51,530
It's not the time to talk about
someone you know.

2360
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:53,270
Are there more questions left?
I feel bad.

2361
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,400
Se Yoon and Jong Min
have to get the answers.

2362
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,440
All right.

2363
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,370
We're a lot worse
than you expected, right?

2364
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,640
Yes.

2365
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,640
(The betrayal of the elder
with 18 years of experience)

2366
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:04,110
We'll start.

2367
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:06,110
(They are stuck in the valley.)

2368
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:08,750
One, two, three, go!

2369
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,180
- Three...
- Choi Min Sik, "Casino."

2370
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:11,180
Yes!

2371
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,920
- Move away.
- I should've gone first.

2372
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,590
One, two, three, go!

2373
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:17,720
- Three, two,
- Se Yoon.

2374
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,190
- Lee Sung Min, "Misaeng."
- one.

2375
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:21,260
- Correct!
- It's us now.

2376
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:24,360
All right. One, two, three, go!

2377
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,770
- Three,
- Lee Joon!

2378
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:27,170
- two...
- Kang Ha Neul, "Squid Game."

2379
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:28,440
Correct!

2380
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,200
- We're in trouble.
- We answered a lot.

2381
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,340
- I don't know.
- One, two, three, go!

2382
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:33,610
- Three,
- You should know this one.

2383
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:34,710
- two,
- DinDin.

2384
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,110
- one.
- Kim You Jung, "My Demon."

2385
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,410
- Okay!
- Okay!

2386
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:39,280
- I saved all of us.
- Nice one.

2387
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,280
I saved all of us this time.

2388
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,550
I won't let it slide if you don't
get it right this time, Seon Ho.

2389
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:42,620
- Me too.
- All right.

2390
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,480
One, two, three, go!

2391
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:45,950
- Seon Ho!
- Sae Ho!

2392
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:47,250
Park Sung Woong,
"A Violent Prosecutor."

2393
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:48,490
- Correct!
- Gosh!

2394
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,090
- Sae Ho!
- Get ready!

2395
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:51,220
- Sae Ho!
- Get ready to get him.

2396
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,460
- Get ready to get him.
- Gosh.

2397
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,900
- Doing that will hinder me.
- Okay.

2398
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,430
Let's just let him be comfortable.

2399
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:57,730
(Which question will he be given?)

2400
01:19:57,730 --> 01:19:59,670
One, two, three, go!

2401
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:03,370
- Go! Three, two...
- Lee Ha Nee, "Tazza."

2402
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,910
Lee Ha Nee, "Tazza."

2403
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:07,570
- Aren't I right?
- Correct!

2404
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:09,010
(Cho Sae Ho is correct!)

2405
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:10,510
- You will receive 20 dollars.
- Nice.

2406
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:12,010
You can't do this
before I answer it.

2407
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,850
We'll do it one last time...

2408
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,180
as we bet 20 dollars.

2409
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,180
With a 20-dollar bet?

2410
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,890
How about getting another chance
with two people diving in?

2411
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:20,250
- Okay!
- What are you doing, Jong Min?

2412
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:22,590
- What are you doing?
- I'm cold!

2413
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,720
Sacrifice yourself
for the young ones.

2414
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,290
- The youngest should go.
- Just be quick, Jong Min.

2415
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:26,360
(Kim Boomer)

2416
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,690
Let's do this then.

2417
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:29,660
Since we're doing this
as their one-year anniversary,

2418
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,960
- the two new members should go.
- Right!

2419
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,370
Just dive in to celebrate
your one-year anniversary!

2420
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:36,500
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- You guys planned this!

2421
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:38,340
All right. You go first.

2422
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:41,110
Viewers, please watch us for a year.

2423
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:43,080
- No. That's not what I meant.
- What was that?

2424
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,510
Is it your first shoot today?

2425
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:46,610
Viewers,
you were with us for a whole year,

2426
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:48,320
and we were able to do well
thanks to all of you.

2427
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,650
Please continue to show us
your support.

2428
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:53,250
- Let's go, 2 Days and 1 Night!
- Let's go!

2429
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:54,520
Thank you!

2430
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:55,990
Gosh!

2431
01:20:57,490 --> 01:20:58,490
There we go.

2432
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:00,560
Get in!

2433
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,260
(Thanks to Sae Ho
and Joon's sacrifice...)

2434
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,300
- Done.
- Gosh, it's so cold.

2435
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,470
Done, right?

2436
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,270
All right.
You'll get another chance.

2437
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:10,840
(The final extra game starts.)

2438
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,570
- Why won't that ever happen?
- Right.

2439
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:14,270
But comedians...

2440
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:15,280
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

2441
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,980
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

2442
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,680
- What's wrong with him?
- Do we need to save him?

2443
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,410
- Are you a breakdancer or what?
- I slipped.

2444
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:22,880
- What was that?
- I slipped.

2445
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:24,220
Did something happen?

2446
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,120
He's a strange one.

2447
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,050
If you fail this time,
you should give up.

2448
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,190
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2449
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,730
- We were awful.
- We're really bad at this.

2450
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:35,500
One, two, three, go!

2451
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,600
- Yes!
- Three,
- two,
- Sae Ho.

2452
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,430
- one.
- Kim Nam Gil, "The Fiery Priest."

2453
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:40,770
- Okay!
- Okay!

2454
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:41,900
- He was in a lot of shows.
- All right.

2455
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:45,140
One, two, three, go!

2456
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:49,040
Three, two, one.

2457
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,810
- Jung Yu Mi.
- Jung Yu Mi, "Born 1978."

2458
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:53,380
"Kim Ji Young: Born 1982."

2459
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:54,480
- It wasn't 1978?
- Correct!

2460
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,550
- Yes!
- Okay!

2461
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,320
- What are you doing?
- Gosh.

2462
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,250
Why mention 1978? Was she born
in the Year of the Dragon?

2463
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:03,160
One, two, three, go!

2464
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:04,620
- Three...
- We told you earlier!

2465
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,860
- We told you earlier!
- Kim Ji Yeon, "The Glory."

2466
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:08,630
- Kim Ji Yeon, "The Glory."
- Okay! Correct!

2467
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:10,200
- Done.
- I heard Kim Ji Yeon.

2468
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,030
- He shouldn't have gone.
- Lim Ji Yeon.

2469
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:14,630
According to the Initial Sound Law,
it's Lim Ji Yeon.

2470
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:16,540
It sounded like Kim Ji Yeon,
but he said Lim Ji Yeon.

2471
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:19,840
- One, two, three,
- Who will go next?

2472
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,170
- I won't know most of them.
- go!

2473
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,540
- Here we go.
- Do you know this one?

2474
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:24,010
- I don't know.
- Two...

2475
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,150
Ji Chang Wook, "The Manipulated."

2476
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:27,750
- Nice.
- It will be released soon.

2477
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,780
It was already filmed.

2478
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,980
He filmed it with Doh Kyung Soo.

2479
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:31,120
- Really?
- They're done with the filming.

2480
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,290
It will be released next January.

2481
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:33,350
Right!

2482
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:35,060
- Okay! Correct!
- I'm certain.

2483
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:36,360
Get ready. Let's go!

2484
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,160
- Joon.
- Say it right away if you know.

2485
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,960
Let me take it if it's an easy one.
I won't know a lot.

2486
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,130
All right.

2487
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:43,060
It's just the two of you left.

2488
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,270
One, two, three, go!

2489
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,370
- You go.
- Three, two...

2490
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:50,440
Chung Kyung Ho,
"Oh My Ghost Clients."

2491
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:51,910
Correct! It's the last one.

2492
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:54,640
- Joon will decide your fate.
- Okay.

2493
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,480
- Get ready.
- Joon!

2494
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,510
(We trust you, Joon.)

2495
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:58,810
- Let's do this.
- We got this.

2496
01:22:58,810 --> 01:23:00,980
One, two, three, go!

2497
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:02,250
- Let's go!
- Three...

2498
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:04,820
Kim Sung Kyun, "Nameless Gangster."

2499
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:05,920
He did it.

2500
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:08,420
Correct!

2501
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,790
You all have made it.

2502
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:12,090
You will receive 20 more dollars.

2503
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:14,490
Everyone, be quiet. Go.

2504
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,030
- Lim Ji Yeon!
- One more time.

2505
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:17,330
- Lim Ji Yeon!
- Done.

2506
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:18,500
We got the audio.

2507
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:20,170
He said Kim Ji Yeon earlier.

2508
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:21,800
He mentioned the member of Roo'Ra.

2509
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,940
- Say it as you get up.
- Really?

2510
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:25,540
Everyone, be quiet! Say the answer.

2511
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:28,610
Lim Ji Yeon, "The Glory."

2512
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:30,080
Done! That's a wrap.

2513
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,710
- He got confused with the name.
- He said Kim Ji Yeon earlier.

2514
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:33,250
I couldn't believe my ears.

2515
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:34,650
We'll get three bowls
of seafood kalguksu...

2516
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:35,720
and three servings of pork cutlet.

2517
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:36,920
Got it.

2518
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:40,250
(After the exciting time
in the water,)

2519
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:41,490
(the members of the big family
feel very hungry.)

2520
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:44,420
I wish we are served a lot of soup.

2521
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:46,930
I wish they would serve us
this much rice too.

2522
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:48,430
We should share the pork cutlet...

2523
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:50,130
as a pair like this
and a pair like this.

2524
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:51,870
Seon Ho and Se Yoon
can share one too.

2525
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:52,870
- The pork cutlet?
- Right.

2526
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:56,200
I'm going to eat
a lot of the pork cutlet.

2527
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,270
Okay.

2528
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,010
Who are you saying that to?

2529
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:01,110
He must've been talking to Joon.

2530
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,380
(The food is coming.)

2531
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:07,810
- Gosh!
- That's a lot of food.

2532
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:10,550
Gosh, there's a lot of seafood.

2533
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:12,120
(Kalguksu filled with seafood)

2534
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:14,120
Gosh, the seafood.

2535
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:16,390
The kalguksu should be boiled
a bit more.

2536
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:19,390
Gosh, it's the pork cutlet!

2537
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,160
Gosh, there are three plates.

2538
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,460
- Let's cut it in half.
- Okay.

2539
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:25,500
- It will be evenly split.
- Right.

2540
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,170
- Should we split it evenly too?
- Okay.

2541
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,140
(Crunchy)

2542
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,400
Gosh, it looks really good.

2543
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:33,810
Is that okay?

2544
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,840
- Okay?
- Okay.

2545
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,510
- The rice too.
- Right.

2546
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:42,380
(The rice is split
exactly in half too.)

2547
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,190
Gosh, this is amazing.

2548
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,420
Hasn't it been a while for us...

2549
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:49,590
since we ate this well?

2550
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:51,020
We always eat this well.

2551
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,860
Am I the only one
who's living in a different world?

2552
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,160
You say that every week.

2553
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:55,260
It's because you always lose.

2554
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,100
It's because you always lose.

2555
01:24:57,830 --> 01:24:59,130
Would you like to try some?

2556
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:02,170
(Joon these days...)

2557
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,370
(has been failing
in every lunch mission.)

2558
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:09,480
(He has barely eaten properly
during the day.)

2559
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:12,250
Why does it feel like it's been
a long while since I've eaten?

2560
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:14,680
(Because it really has been
a while.)

2561
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,420
- Let's begin.
- Thank you for the food.

2562
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:17,780
Thank you for the food.

2563
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:22,360
(He makes a sweet and spicy sauce
with the wasabi.)

2564
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:26,490
(He then takes a bite
after dipping it in the sauce.)

2565
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:29,760
It's good.
The pork cutlet is so good.

2566
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:32,700
- This is the Western style, right?
- Right

2567
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:33,830
(Perfect after water activities)

2568
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:35,600
Gosh, the pork cutlet is good.

2569
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,870
(Sweet and crunchy
Western-style pork cutlet)

2570
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:42,380
(Eating wildly)

2571
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,980
(It tastes amazing
with a dip of wasabi.)

2572
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:47,950
- What should we do?
- Let's eat.

2573
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,050
Will you add the wasabi?

2574
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,020
Sorry?
Gosh, there's hair all over me.

2575
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:54,620
(His gray hair
keeps getting in his face.)

2576
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:57,220
- The pork cutlet is so good.
- It's eaten like this.

2577
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,090
- With this on it.
- Okay.

2578
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:00,630
(A big chunk)

2579
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:05,770
- The pork cutlet has a kick.
- My gosh.

2580
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,570
This is the Western pork cutlet.

2581
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:09,300
(Gasping)

2582
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,470
What's wrong?

2583
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,040
The wasabi...

2584
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,510
(Shouting)

2585
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:17,140
(The pungent flavor
at the tip of his nose)

2586
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:19,450
My goodness.

2587
01:26:20,110 --> 01:26:21,880
(Giggling)

2588
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:23,480
Why?

2589
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:24,850
Jong Min...

2590
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,920
He picked up a big lump of wasabi.

2591
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,420
It was a lot.

2592
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,090
And he shouted
as soon as he put it in his mouth.

2593
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:31,120
(A disaster he brought upon himself)

2594
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:33,730
Anything tastes pungent
when you eat that much.

2595
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,460
(He neutralizes his mouth
with pork cutlet too late.)

2596
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,360
How are you feeling, Joon?

2597
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,500
- What?
- Did you want to do this?

2598
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:43,470
(The reason he came to the valley
again after a year)

2599
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,470
(Lee Joon's signature)

2600
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:50,580
(His pitiful eating show)

2601
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:54,880
(It all began with the "valley.")

2602
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:59,290
(The turning point
in Lee Joon's eating life)

2603
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:02,720
(He stared silently at his food
as if he'd drool at any moment.)

2604
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,690
(And he's still obsessed with food.)

2605
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:09,200
We should boil it more.

2606
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,630
(He sometimes throws a tantrum.)

2607
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:16,240
(He used to enjoy eating alone.)

2608
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,440
The kimchi is good.

2609
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,010
Se Yoon likes things like this.

2610
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:23,040
(Now, he remembers
his members' tastes.)

2611
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,940
- Welcome!
- Welcome.

2612
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,410
(He's not just
a special guest anymore.)

2613
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:28,110
(They've become family
who laugh together.)

2614
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,950
(The changes over the past year)

2615
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,120
(Now it's time to eat kalguksu.)

2616
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,320
The mussels look nice.

2617
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,560
I think it's ready to eat.

2618
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:38,390
Are you trying the noodles?

2619
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:39,390
(The mom tastes the food
to see if it's ready.)

2620
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:40,860
He looks like a mom.

2621
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:44,130
Now you can eat it however you like.

2622
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:45,260
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

2623
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,000
It has a lot of seafood in it.

2624
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,100
This is a lot of seafood.

2625
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:49,200
(Looking at the seafood piled up,)

2626
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,940
(he can only smile.)

2627
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:53,440
- Mother.
- Yes.

2628
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,970
You have weak teeth,
so I'll give you only the soup.

2629
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:56,180
It's okay. I have dentures.

2630
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:57,980
- You have dentures? I see.
- Yes.

2631
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:02,550
My gosh. It's really...

2632
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:03,580
(Impressed)

2633
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:05,450
It's just seafood itself.

2634
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,860
(Kimchi is a must.)

2635
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:18,800
(The warm soup seeps
into their chilled body.)

2636
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:21,270
It tastes even better
as we eat it at the valley.

2637
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,040
It's so nice and refreshing.

2638
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,370
(They are twice as happy,
eating at the valley.)

2639
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:26,840
(Getting a refill of kalguksu)

2640
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:30,410
This is three servings of kalguksu,
so it's a little... Right?

2641
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:32,050
Yes. I wish we had more.

2642
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,280
- My gosh.
- Se Yoon, eat this.

2643
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,450
(The daughter lets the mom
eat a piece of pork cutlet.)

2644
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:37,480
- You can eat it. Gosh.
- I'm done.

2645
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,650
(He's glad
to have a daughter like him.)

2646
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:44,320
- Can we get more soup?
- No, it's okay.

2647
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,390
(The daughter's sweet gesture)

2648
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:47,260
We don't have this.
Why do you leave the food?

2649
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,530
(The grandmother intercepts it.)

2650
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,330
Because I want.

2651
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:52,070
(He puts it in his mouth
without hesitation.)

2652
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,230
Is this rice mine?

2653
01:28:53,230 --> 01:28:54,400
No, it's mine.

2654
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,670
- Is it yours?
- You can have it.

2655
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:57,670
(He even eats his grandson's rice.)

2656
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:00,610
Se Yoon. Did you eat it already?

2657
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,640
Did you eat it already?

2658
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:04,480
- Eat what?
- The pork cutlet.

2659
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,550
(Empty)

2660
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:08,450
(Mother?)

2661
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:10,050
Grandma!

2662
01:29:10,650 --> 01:29:11,720
Mom!

2663
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,420
He gave it to his mom.

2664
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:15,760
Why would the grandma
eat the mom's pork cutlet?

2665
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:17,660
- How could you eat that?
- Did you really eat it?

2666
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:18,860
(He lost his pork cutlet
with his eyes open.)

2667
01:29:19,090 --> 01:29:20,590
I forgot eating it.

2668
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:23,100
Do you want me
to make you lose your memory?

2669
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:27,300
(Grandma Jong Min is unstoppable.)

2670
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:30,300
So is this
the one-year anniversary special?

2671
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:31,300
Yes.

2672
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,370
We came up with a lot of ideas.

2673
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:36,780
The ideas weren't so bad.

2674
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,780
Sae Ho talked...

2675
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:42,420
about things like scuba diving,
baseball, arcade, and basketball.

2676
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,750
I like that. They all sound good.

2677
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:46,320
Joon's idea was...

2678
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,520
going on an overseas trip
on a duck boat.

2679
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:50,920
(Glaring)

2680
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,590
Going from the Han River...

2681
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:54,490
out to the sea on a boat
sold at a mall.

2682
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:58,600
Going to another city
on a children's tricycle.

2683
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:00,700
You were going to kill us.

2684
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:03,940
You don't seem to like my ideas.

2685
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,740
You can create your own channel
and do those things. It will be fun.

2686
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,910
- I think so.
- No, I want to do them with you.

2687
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:13,310
Did you enjoy your meal?

2688
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:14,810
- Yes.
- It was really good.

2689
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:16,880
To celebrate
your one-year anniversary,

2690
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,920
we will give you some time
to enjoy dessert.

2691
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,450
Right. We need a cake.

2692
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,990
I need dessert.

2693
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:24,020
(That sounds great.)

2694
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:26,060
Let's go eat some dessert.

2695
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:27,160
- I love it.
- Really?

2696
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:29,060
I'll have a chocolate cake.

2697
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:31,060
(What kind of dessert
is waiting for them?)

2698
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:32,870
When is KOYOTE's new song
coming out?

2699
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,430
On August 6.

2700
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:35,670
Is it Songwriter Choi Jun Yeong,

2701
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:36,870
- whom KOYOYE used to work with?
- Yes.

2702
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,210
- And after a long time, again...
- Right. He wrote "Pure Love."

2703
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,940
He wrote a lot of KOYOTE's songs.

2704
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:43,040
He's famous.

2705
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,540
- Can we listen to it?
- Sure.

2706
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,210
I love your songs.

2707
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,950
It's just an exciting song.
That's KOYOTE's style.

2708
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:50,920
MC Im Cheol.

2709
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,350
Let's go!

2710
01:30:57,090 --> 01:30:59,460
- What?
- It's REDM.

2711
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:00,630
- What?
- It's really...

2712
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:02,330
Retro EDM.

2713
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,870
I want to go to a nightclub.

2714
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:09,770
- One, two, three.
- Let's go!

2715
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:11,400
(Dancing)

2716
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,610
I love the song.

2717
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,110
Nice.

2718
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:16,780
(Shouting)

2719
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,650
- What's the title?
- "Call Me."

2720
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:21,150
- What?
- "Call Me."

2721
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:22,620
- "Call Me."
- Give me a call.

2722
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:23,920
("Call Me" by KOYOTE)

2723
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:37,960
- My universe!
- Here we go, now!

2724
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:45,100
(Are you going to kill me?)

2725
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:49,080
(Today is our last Saturday night)

2726
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:51,480
(More fun things
will happen next week.)

2727
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,380
(Next episode)

2728
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:55,950
(To blow away...)

2729
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:57,520
(the midsummer heat,)

2730
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:01,120
(they are coming.)

2731
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:03,960
(Team 2 Days and 1 Night is here.)

2732
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:06,460
(What? 2 Days and 1 Night?)

2733
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,800
(They are coming to you
in a cooler way.)

2734
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,870
(A mysterious voice
echoes through the building.)

2735
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:16,440
(The moment you are discovered,)

2736
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,770
(it's over.)

2737
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:20,010
(The game has begun.)

2738
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:22,840
(If you stay together, you survive.)

2739
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,580
(If you split up,)

2740
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:26,950
(you die.)

2741
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:30,680
(Things are more difficult
than expected.)

2742
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:33,320
(There's only one chance left.)

2743
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:36,420
