1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,440
Let's do this.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,910
What's left?
Seon Ho seems to have pork.

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,980
I have my spicy pork.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,710
- To be honest...
- Yes?

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,350
I lost my spicy pork.

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,510
But I can put my rice in my soup...

7
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,820
and eat it with the kimchi...

8
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,150
- and shredded radish kimchi.
- Okay.

9
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,280
I have the rolled omelet.

10
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,790
- Sae Ho?
- Number seven is seaweed soup.

11
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,490
- DinDin, your number seven is?
- Seaweed soup.

12
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,860
This is about Seon Ho's pork.

13
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,560
- Let's do this. You can manage it.
- Win for me.

14
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,130
Seon Ho will start.

15
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,760
- I go 1st?
- Seon Ho's 1st?

16
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,170
One, two, three, go!

17
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,730
- "Bohemian Rhapsody."
- Correct.

18
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,640
- That's it.
- I'm too scared to play now.

19
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,940
Go!

20
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,340
- Three!
- Sphinx.

21
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,440
- Yes.
- Correct.

22
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,380
One, two, three,

23
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,810
- go!
- "Immortal Songs."

24
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,810
Correct.

25
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,910
One, two, three, go!

26
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,180
- Three!
- "Teach Me."

27
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,020
- Correct.
- Gosh.

28
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,850
- That was a confusing one.
- Okay.

29
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,090
Go!

30
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,560
- Three, two...
- Power bank.

31
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,790
- Yes.
- Correct.

32
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,460
- Here we go.
- It's me again.

33
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,690
I'll give you some pork.

34
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,900
Go! Three, two...

35
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,200
- Toe socks!
- Correct!

36
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,530
- What?
- That was a hard one.

37
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,830
- Toe socks?
- Toe socks.

38
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,540
I thought it was
Pippi Longstocking or something.

39
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,600
Okay, go!

40
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,410
Three, two...

41
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,210
- Vacuum cleaner.
- one!

42
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,410
- Correct.
- Okay, let's go!

43
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,110
I thought it was "air purifier."

44
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,450
That's what I thought it was.

45
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,650
Well done.

46
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,480
One, two, three, go!

47
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,390
- Three, two...
- Oh, okay.

48
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,720
- Everest.
- Yes.

49
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,150
- Correct.
- Okay.

50
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,460
Okay, let's go!

51
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,020
(The fate of Seon Ho's pork...)

52
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,130
(and the guys' seaweed soup
depends on the last quiz.)

53
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,190
Go!

54
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,430
- Three!
- Okay.

55
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,300
- Two!
- Speed bump.

56
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,300
- Okay.
- Okay!
Correct.

57
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,300
You win the seventh round.

58
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,800
(Round 7 is a success!)

59
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,340
- Number 8...
- Number 8!

60
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,070
If we defend number eight,

61
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,570
- it's not too bad.
- We can still eat.

62
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,280
- If we share...
- My number eight...

63
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,710
We can still eat.

64
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,180
I got lots of crunchy fried chicken.

65
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,580
My number eight is rice.

66
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,720
My eight is rice too.

67
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,550
- Mine is rice too.
- We did well.

68
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,290
- You end with pork?
- Spicy pork.

69
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,520
- Please.
- Today...

70
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,220
This is madness.

71
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,790
Let's play.

72
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,060
One, two, three, go!

73
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,860
- Three, two...
- Mona Lisa.

74
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,800
- Correct.
- The first try is hard.

75
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,970
- Go! Three!
- Okay.

76
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,470
- Two...
- "The Wizard of Oz."

77
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,600
- Correct.
- Well done.

78
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,340
- I didn't know that.
- That was tough.

79
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,770
- Go! Three, two...
- Canned...

80
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,140
(Pike mackerel canned)

81
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,180
- One!
- mackerel pike.

82
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,380
- Correct.
- Good.

83
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,810
You eat that a lot at home.

84
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,180
Go!

85
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,080
- Three, two...
- Korea Tourism Organization.

86
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,180
- That's it.
- Correct.

87
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,290
- Yes.
- Okay.

88
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,050
Go! Three!

89
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,760
- Two...
- Orchestra!

90
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,620
- Correct.
- Let's go!

91
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,730
(Orchestra)

92
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,460
One, two, three,

93
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,900
- Go!
- Leaning Tower of Pisa!

94
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,030
- Yes.
- That's it.

95
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,360
- Correct.
- Okay.

96
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,500
- Okay.
- My gosh.

97
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,270
- Let's eat.
- I know every one but mine.

98
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,470
One, two, three, go!

99
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,770
- Three, two...
- "Square's Dream."

100
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,870
- Correct.
- I didn't know that.

101
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,110
IU's song.

102
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,140
Square

103
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,310
Well done, Joon.

104
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,750
Go, Se Yoon!

105
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,750
Give him a second.

106
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,080
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

107
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,350
- Let's go. Good luck!
- I'm ready.

108
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,520
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

109
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
Come at me!

110
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,590
- Give it to him!
- Come at me!

111
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,920
One, two, three, go!

112
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,090
- Three, two...
- Oh, it's...

113
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,660
- Beach volleyball.
- Okay.

114
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,860
- Correct!
- Let's go!

115
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,490
You didn't know it, did you?

116
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,960
- Do it.
- Okay, we're on.

117
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,770
The last one. One, two, three,

118
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,370
go! Three!

119
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,240
- Oath of the Peach Garden.
- Two...

120
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,270
Yes!

121
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,070
- Correct.
- Okay!

122
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,470
Round Eight is a success.

123
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,910
Gosh.

124
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,240
Well done.

125
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,780
Good job!

126
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,980
Beach volleyball
was a dangerous one.

127
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,910
That's it, everyone.

128
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,620
- Are we done?
- You kept quite a lot.

129
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,650
We defended a lot.

130
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,120
- We lost just 3 out of 8.
- That's not bad.

131
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,160
I don't have rice. But still.

132
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,620
If we share our food,
it might be a decent meal.

133
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,860
(They obtained 5 out of 8 dishes.)

134
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,360
- Go ahead.
- We can share our food, right?

135
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
- We can share it, right?
- Yes.

136
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,460
- Thank you for the food.
- Sure.

137
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,000
- Gosh, thank you.
- Seriously.

138
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,130
- Enjoy your meal.
- Let me give you some.

139
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,270
- Can I get rice from anyone?
- Yes.

140
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,670
- I'll use the lid. Here's the rice.
- I'll give you some of my rice.

141
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,900
I have everything but the rice.

142
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,340
- Yes.
- Do you have any spicy pork?

143
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,040
- Im Cheol, do you have spicy pork?
- No.

144
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,480
- I have some. Let's share it.
- Hey, take mine.

145
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,540
Hey.

146
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,040
- Take the rice.
- Take mine.

147
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,880
- Okay.
- Take some of my spicy pork.

148
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,220
- Sae Ho, how much do you want?
- I'm good. Give it to Joon.

149
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,350
- Take it.
- Okay.

150
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
- Yes.
- Thank you for the food.

151
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,920
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

152
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,490
(Se Yoon's first bite
is the seaweed soup.)

153
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,700
Gosh, this is good.
The seaweed soup is tasty.

154
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,200
(Every single staff member loves
the food truck's seaweed soup.)

155
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,430
(Joon has a bite of the spicy pork
and a bite of the rice.)

156
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,400
(Then he takes another bite
of the rice.)

157
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,570
Have some of this.

158
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,970
Gosh, that wasn't easy.

159
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,080
It feels like I'm having a meal
on a picnic.

160
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,650
(It feels like they're on a picnic
as they're eating outdoors.)

161
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,110
This is supposed to be
spicy pork ssambap.

162
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,250
Let me make a wrap.

163
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,580
(Se Yoon starts making a wrap,)

164
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,080
(which is the main dish
of the meal.)

165
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,390
- Thank you, Seon Ho.
- Don't mention it.

166
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,690
- Have more if you need more.
- You gave me meat.

167
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,990
- Can I have one more of this?
- Of course.

168
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,220
Hey, this kimchi is so good.

169
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,690
(He finishes the wrap with kimchi.)

170
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,860
- Gosh, the kimchi is amazing.
- Yes.

171
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,060
(He finishes the wrap with kimchi.)

172
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
This is so good.

173
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,770
(The spicy pork wrap
brings a smile.)

174
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,440
(There's a ssam fever
thanks to Se Yoon.)

175
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,840
Gosh, this is so good.

176
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,940
I'm serious. This is so good.

177
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,150
It's the best spicy pork
I had recently.

178
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,320
Even this ssamjang is good.
I think the food truck chef...

179
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,220
- Really?
- made this ssamjang too.

180
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,590
- There's a special ratio.
- Yes.

181
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,620
Really?

182
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,420
I got a lot of spicy pork,
but I lost that plate.

183
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,260
I have a lot of it here.

184
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,000
(I must have one more bite
since I'm disappointed by that.)

185
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,030
Hey, did anyone get this dish?

186
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,970
The more I eat, the more I want
to take back the dishes we lost.

187
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,210
- That's how tasty this is.
- Totally.

188
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,940
But we did pretty well.

189
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,680
- We did pretty well.
- Yes.

190
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,110
- Se Yoon.
- Gosh, this is tasty.

191
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,080
- Can I have a bite of the dessert?
- Gosh.

192
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,580
- Sure.
- Se Yoon, we have a lot here too.

193
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,050
- Thank you.
- We're a family.

194
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,290
Why don't you have one first?
It's yours.

195
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,150
- I'm still chewing. Come on.
- It's still yours. My gosh.

196
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,890
We're a family.

197
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,160
(He smells it first.)

198
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,300
- It smells...
- It smelled so good earlier.

199
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,030
(As if he's under a spell,)

200
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,100
(he puts it in his mouth.)

201
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,440
Is it good?
Gosh, you're savoring it.

202
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,770
(The crunchy fried chicken's flavor
mesmerizes him.)

203
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,980
I just had
the crunchy fried chicken.

204
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,710
Other crunchy fried chickens
are quite sweet.

205
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,680
This one isn't that sweet,
but it's so good.

206
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
The food truck chef used to run
a fried chicken restaurant.

207
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,220
- Really?
- Yes.

208
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,390
(The food truck chef used to run
a fried chicken restaurant.)

209
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,890
Then we won't have to play games
for the sleeping arrangements.

210
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,460
I guess we won't have to play
games for that...

211
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,690
because we'll be sleeping outdoors.

212
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,530
You know what? Director Joo might
be touched by our performance...

213
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,030
and give us a chance.

214
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,330
So let's wait and see.

215
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,030
Gosh, I had such a nice meal.

216
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,640
- The kimchi is so good.
- Yes.

217
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,370
I ate my food like a madman.

218
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,110
This is tasty.

219
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,710
Can we go to sleep now?

220
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,010
We...

221
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,950
Can't we just put our heads down
and go to sleep here?

222
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,050
Sleeping under the tables
might be good.

223
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,420
The wind won't bother us that way.

224
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,990
- Right?
- Yes.

225
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,190
We can put the tables side by side.
It's like creating a dark room.

226
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,890
We can put the air mattresses
under the table and go to sleep.

227
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,090
- It'd be perfect then.
- It'd be so perfect.

228
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,760
Totally. Gosh.

229
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,860
- This will be our blackout curtain.
- That'd be amazing.

230
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,800
- This is the best.
- They're like blackout curtains.

231
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,230
What are we going to do?

232
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,130
Let's clean up
and get ourselves organized.

233
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,400
- Okay.
- We'll be back then.

234
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,600
- Okay. Thank you for the food.
- Yes.

235
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,010
(What awaits the members?)

236
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
My gosh, it's getting chilly.

237
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,980
(It's quite chilly
now that the sun has gone down.)

238
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,050
- All five of you are here, right?
- Okay.

239
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,150
Are we doing something here?

240
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,380
- Are we doing something?
- That's the plan.

241
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,620
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

242
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,750
- Okay.
- The night is long.

243
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,390
I'm feeling energetic after dinner.

244
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,790
How about doing a team cheer?

245
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,760
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

246
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,890
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

247
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,160
Thank you for the rescue.

248
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,500
- All right.
- He'll rescue some of us.

249
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,430
- You'll go to sleep soon.
- I bet.

250
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,230
I know that
you guys acquired some supplies.

251
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,800
But they might not be enough
for you to spend the night here.

252
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,070
- You bet.
- I knew it.

253
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,270
- It's so cold.
- It's cold.

254
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,540
I hope the viewers
don't get the wrong idea.

255
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,580
He's the weird one.
It's really cold here.

256
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,880
- All of you...
- It's cold.

257
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,280
will be sleeping outdoors.
That won't change.

258
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,610
- Gosh.
- But only...

259
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,650
- one of you will get a benefit.
- What?

260
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,250
It's the biggest downside
of sleeping outdoors.

261
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,150
This item will protect you
from bugs and mosquitoes.

262
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,190
- It's the mosquito net.
- Gosh, the mosquito net.

263
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,360
- The mosquito net.
- And...

264
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,820
he will get a blanket,
pillow, sleeping bag,

265
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,490
camping mat, and tarpaulin.

266
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,890
- Only one of you...
- He'll get all of them?

267
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,530
will have a chance
to take all of these supplies.

268
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,930
- But are we allowed to share them?
- No.

269
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,200
- Well, based on our rules,
- That's not allowed.

270
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,600
- they are exclusive to one person.
- My gosh.

271
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,140
- One person should enjoy them all.
- Yes, let's do that.

272
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,770
But what if someone kneels down
and bows?

273
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,370
- No. I'll step on their knees.
- No.

274
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,680
(His knees will be crushed.)

275
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,010
- Let me show them first.
- Let's do that.

276
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,250
- Bring them in.
- Gosh.

277
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,380
- That's a premium bunch of items.
- My gosh.

278
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,950
That's everything we need.
You can set up a hotel here.

279
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,950
(Amazed)

280
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,720
If you have them, it might be better
to sleep here than in a room.

281
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,390
(Having these supplies can put
sleeping indoors to shame.)

282
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,390
(Coveted additional
bivouac supplies)

283
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,090
This will be an individual match
with three rounds.

284
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,460
People will be eliminated
after each round.

285
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,330
- Just like "Squid Game."
- Yes.

286
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,400
So the last one standing...

287
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,540
can have this decked-out
sleeping arrangement.

288
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,040
It's better to get eliminated
in Round One if I can't make it.

289
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,740
- I want the supplies. Right?
- Yes.

290
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,240
- That's better.
- All right.

291
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,610
- Here's Round 1.
- Round 1.

292
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,010
It's called Fly, Plastic Bag.

293
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,550
- Fly, Plastic Bag?
- Yes.

294
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,250
- Fly, Plastic Bag?
- Please set it up.

295
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,120
- Just that.
- How much is this?

296
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,750
This looks nice.

297
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,120
- Gosh, this...
- This is great.

298
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,290
- Hold on.
- That's the best supply.

299
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,760
- Are we going to put that there?
- Don't take it with you.

300
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,830
- Hurry.
- This mat...

301
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,890
Gosh, this mat is amazing.

302
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,160
- It's better than an air mattress.
- Hey, this is...

303
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,530
Guys, you can sort of guess
how to play this game, right?

304
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,600
- Oh, this?
- Grab the jacket with both hands.

305
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,640
And then run toward the mat.

306
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,240
Fall on your belly...

307
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,570
and fly the plastic bag
as far as possible to win.

308
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,340
We'll measure the distance
from the tip of the plastic bag.

309
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,280
If you touch the bag,
you're disqualified.

310
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,920
The one with the lowest record
will be eliminated right away.

311
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,390
Will your lymph nodes be okay?

312
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,050
- I'll do my best...
- Why don't you...

313
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,490
without injuring myself.

314
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,960
Okay.

315
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,690
Okay.

316
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,590
(Let's play fair.)

317
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Here I go.

318
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,730
(DinDin will give it a try.)

319
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,040
(What will the first record be?)

320
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,770
(He runs toward the mat
with an innocent smile...)

321
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,180
(and then falls flat on his face.)

322
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,810
- Gosh.
- Three,

323
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,850
- Two.
- two, one.

324
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,550
- Let's measure the distance.
- Okay. I'm good.

325
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,850
- Are you okay?
- I'm good!

326
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,490
- Gosh.
- Your face...

327
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,050
- This will hurt a lot.
- Okay.

328
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,720
- And...
- Watch.

329
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,330
- Wait. Is this your nose?
- Yes. That's my nose.

330
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,430
Watch. When you fall down...

331
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,000
If I had gotten a nose job,
it would've ruined my nose.

332
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,500
It survived because I hadn't.
See? I didn't get a nose job.

333
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,240
(He proves that
his nose is all natural.)

334
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,770
- All right.
- Come on. You can't do that.

335
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,440
- Why did you do that on your turn?
- Come on.

336
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,540
I must set it up.

337
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,980
You can't do that!

338
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,340
How come our setup is different?

339
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,250
Well, that's how it is here.

340
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,480
Let's do it.

341
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,520
(He puffs up the plastic bag
with delicate touches.)

342
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,390
My gosh.

343
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,890
What? Gosh.

344
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,160
My gosh.

345
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,690
(But his hat flattens the bag.)

346
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,860
- I...
- It's okay.

347
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,360
- I'm anemic. I'm sorry.
- Really?

348
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,600
- Could you move back a bit?
- Okay.

349
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,860
- If you faint here, it'll hurt.
- Okay.

350
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,000
- Please move back a bit.
- I felt so dizzy.

351
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,900
(It seems they can never play fair.)

352
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,940
I'm sorry.

353
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,410
This looks a bit dangerous.

354
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,880
You'll put your hands
in the sleeves?

355
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,050
He's showing us
all kinds of things today.

356
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,050
(He gets ready to win the game.)

357
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,350
I think that's a good idea.
That's good.

358
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,620
- That's nice.
- Gosh.

359
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,020
First of all, his jacket is
three times larger than ours.

360
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,060
That's like a blanket.

361
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,690
I don't need to jump.

362
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,890
- Go ahead.
- Here I go.

363
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,930
(Se Yoon gives it a try.)

364
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,700
- Gosh, I'm a bit scared.
- My goodness.

365
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,870
This is reminding me
of the paper plane from earlier.

366
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Let's go!

367
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,140
(He suddenly remembers
the nightmare of the paper plane.)

368
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,780
(He develops a trauma
of flying objects.)

369
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,480
Okay. Overcome the trauma!

370
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,610
(I can do this.)

371
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,610
Get that!

372
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,020
Okay. Let's go.

373
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,020
(I'll fly the plastic bag
with my power.)

374
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,260
(With Se Yoon's power...)

375
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,000
Three, two, one.

376
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,470
- Right here.
- Measure it.

377
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,270
- My gosh.
- What?

378
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,040
- Okay. I beat his record.
- That was so close.

379
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,110
I survived!

380
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,080
- Gosh, that was so close.
- I survived.

381
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,450
(He beats DinDin in last place
by a close call.)

382
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,080
- Who's going third?
- Me.

383
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,390
(There are all kinds of ruining
each other's chances.)

384
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,220
Hey, now that I've done it,
this might be better.

385
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,590
- I doubt it will make a difference.
- It won't.

386
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,160
(DinDin is doing everything
in his power to win.)

387
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,560
Hold on. That's way too flat.

388
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,700
Go ahead.

389
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,060
(Fluttering)

390
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,970
Here I go.

391
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,600
- Good luck.
- You can surely beat DinDin.

392
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,010
- I think you'll do well.
- Really?

393
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,610
(He believes in Joon's gut feeling.)

394
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,580
Three, two, one.
Measure the distance.

395
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,090
- All right. Seon Ho is leading.
- Next.

396
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,060
Who's next? Is it me?

397
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,590
- It's me. Lymph Nodes.
- Lymph Nodes.

398
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,830
- Mr. Lymph Nodes.
- Lymph Nodes.

399
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,000
- Watch out for your lymph nodes.
- I watched you go.

400
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,800
And I don't think
it will damage my lymph nodes.

401
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,130
- I'll go with...
- Let's watch.

402
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,500
with the slapstick comedy style
instead of running.

403
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,970
I'll trip. So I won't have a choice
but to fall.

404
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,410
Then I'll swing my jacket,
and the bag will happen to fly away.

405
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,380
- Lymphadenitis is nothing.
- Okay. It's nothing.

406
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,580
- Mission Lymph Nodes.
- Okay. Here I go.

407
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,350
Mission Lymph Nodes.

408
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,750
Gosh, the bug is getting in my way.

409
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,350
(My lymph nodes may be injured,
but nothing is impossible.)

410
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,390
Here I go.

411
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,990
(I'll just run.)

412
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,460
(Slapstick comedy is possible.)

413
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,030
(What's the result?)

414
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,710
Three, two, one.

415
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,170
- Measure it.
- My gosh.

416
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,740
- Okay.
- It's Mission Lymph Nodes.

417
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,040
- Gosh, that's...
- I did pretty well. Right?

418
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,110
I bet he lied
about his medical condition.

419
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,910
Come here.

420
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,220
Why...

421
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,090
(Sae Ho is in 1st place
with a huge gap.)

422
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,490
I will...

423
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,760
- take it easy.
- Okay.

424
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,590
- I don't even need to run.
- Please.

425
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,800
- Okay. What about your glasses?
- Here I go.

426
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,630
Are you okay? What's this?

427
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,830
Traditional Korean dance?
Or contemporary dance?

428
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,870
What's this?

429
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,500
(I don't need to run
for this mission.)

430
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,640
He'll come in last.

431
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,640
(He gently steps on the mat.)

432
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,870
- What? Is this allowed?
- No.

433
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,440
- You have to jump here.
- You can't do that.

434
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,040
- You must jump here.
- You can't do that. Jump first.

435
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,380
- Then I would've done this too.
- Joon.

436
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,880
- I would've done that too.
- What is this?

437
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,420
- He's being ridiculous.
- Do it here.

438
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,720
- Okay. You must jump here.
- This is your warning.

439
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,820
- It's a warning.
- Or trip there.

440
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,450
- I'm sorry.
- Look at DinDin's nose.

441
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,220
- Let me try again.
- Okay.

442
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,590
- Here I go.
- Go ahead.

443
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,220
What is it this time?

444
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,630
He looks like a nutcracker.

445
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,230
He's showing off his talent
in spades.

446
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,470
(Did he set a new record?)

447
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
(He flies up gently...)

448
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,210
(and lightly creates a breeze.)

449
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,080
(His bag stops somewhere
around DinDin's record.)

450
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,410
I beat him!

451
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,850
I'm not sure about this.
Let's turn this.

452
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,020
- They might have to do a rematch.
- What's the record?

453
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,820
No, I beat him.

454
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,290
Hey, this is a close call.

455
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,920
- DinDin won.
- I won.

456
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,260
- My gosh. It was so close!
- Gosh.

457
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,130
(DinDin wins by a close call.)

458
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,000
- You never disappoint me.
- He was being too cheeky.

459
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,530
I'm so grateful to you. Seriously.

460
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,770
(Joon is my lifesaver.)

461
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,670
- Joon. You should've run.
- Round One,

462
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,910
Fly, Plastic Bag.

463
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,910
(Not moving)

464
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,980
- What's this?
- Joon is eliminated.

465
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,940
I've never seen
such a meaningless defeat.

466
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,980
He pretended to be so cool
before the game.

467
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,550
Joon, you'll get a trash bag.

468
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,380
You can use it to throw out trash
anywhere in Seoul.

469
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,120
All right. That's a 20L trash bag.

470
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,120
The trash bags are expensive.

471
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,220
Joon is eliminated.

472
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,860
- Let me tell you about Round Two.
- Okay.

473
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,030
All right.
The game for Round Two is called...

474
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,000
Fly, Upper Body.

475
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,900
- What?
- "Upper body."

476
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,030
We'll fly our upper bodies?

477
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,300
I'm good at that. What a pity.

478
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,470
(I'm good at games
that involve my body.)

479
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,140
Two of you will lie on your belly
and face each other first.

480
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,610
Whoever lifts his upper body
and gets their mark higher...

481
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,380
on the board
within 30 seconds will win.

482
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,550
(But they must grab the pen
with both of their hands.)

483
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,290
The highest mark within 30 seconds
will be your record.

484
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,320
- We get 30 seconds?
- Yes.

485
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,620
(List of Matches for Round 2:
Fly, Upper Body)

486
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,290
- You and I should compete.
- Sure.

487
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,660
Okay. The shorties will go first.

488
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,000
(DinDin versus Sae Ho)

489
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,500
(A big match of two shorties)

490
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,230
- Get ready.
- Hold on.

491
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,900
- Okay.
- Don't draw on my face.

492
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,640
- Of course not.
- All right.

493
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,870
- Gosh, this...
- Get ready.

494
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,010
(Fascinated)

495
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,410
Set...

496
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,810
(DinDin is off to a great start.)

497
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,810
Oh, my back!

498
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,950
(Here's my counterattack!)

499
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,920
(He manages to play defense.)

500
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,950
What?

501
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,050
- Why are they so good?
- Bounce back.

502
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,720
(DinDin)

503
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
(Sae Ho)

504
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,060
- What?
- Your records are close.

505
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,260
- Hold it with both hands.
- You guys are close!

506
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,530
(They bounce up at the same time.)

507
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,300
(Sae Ho draws over the 1m line.)

508
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,140
(DinDin's line
goes over the 1m line.)

509
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,040
(DinDin, Sae Ho)

510
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,310
- Gosh, DinDin.
- Oh, my.

511
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,040
You have ten seconds left.

512
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,380
- Sae Ho, you must keep trying.
- A little higher.

513
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,810
(You can do this!)

514
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,910
- Sae Ho, you must keep trying.
- A little higher.

515
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,950
(Did Sae Ho set a new record?)

516
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,720
(He lets go of his pen,
so it won't count.)

517
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
A little higher.

518
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,560
(He's pretty good.)

519
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,160
What's going on, Lymph Nodes?

520
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,390
(They give every ounce of energy
they have left.)

521
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,530
One last time.

522
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,830
- DinDin won.
- Gosh, this is a close one.

523
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,900
- We need to check, though.
- No, DinDin won.

524
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,400
He might've done it with one hand.

525
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
(DinDin, Sae Ho)

526
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,940
(They set their best record
toward the end of the game.)

527
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,910
Hold on. This is really iffy.

528
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,740
My gosh.
How will we determine the winner?

529
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,180
Sae Ho made it pretty high up
toward the end.

530
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,180
- Gosh.
- Wait.

531
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,280
Hey, can you tell from this?

532
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,110
We might have to use a tape line.

533
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,780
- It's 2.3cm.
- It's 2.3cm?

534
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,850
I think DinDin won.

535
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,190
- Yes, DinDin won.
- It's 2.3cm.

536
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,520
(Anticipating)

537
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,920
It's at 3cm already.

538
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,920
(He's certain that he's won.)

539
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,230
It's 3cm. So it's 3cm versus 2.3cm.

540
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,590
Swear on your conscience.
Did you use two hands?

541
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,030
- Yes, I did.
- You did?

542
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,230
I used both of my hands.

543
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,260
- All right.
- DinDin won.

544
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,400
DinDin won.

545
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,070
- Next pair, get ready.
- That wasn't easy.

546
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,330
He's pretty flexible.

547
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,210
(Severely Obese Se Yoon
versus Paper Doll Seon Ho)

548
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,870
How did you lift your upper body?

549
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,480
- How did you do this?
- How did they do this?

550
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,010
- You used both of your hands?
- How did you do it?

551
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,080
You can do this.

552
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,210
- How...
- Guys.

553
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,650
Don't be weak.

554
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,450
How am I supposed to do this?

555
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,790
- You have to use...
- What?

556
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,990
(But the Paper Doll
isn't flexible at all.)

557
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,360
What? How did you do this?

558
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,190
Is this how they did it?

559
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,460
- You can do this.
- Se Yoon...

560
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,930
- Hey, bounce up.
- has good core muscles.

561
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,960
You must do it in a split second.

562
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,330
- Bring it here. This is...
- Get ready,

563
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,600
set...

564
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,400
Go.

565
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,000
One, two, three.

566
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,670
- Great.
- That's how you do it.

567
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,670
Okay.

568
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,210
(I'm going to beat Se Yoon.)

569
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,010
No.

570
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,080
Se Yoon, you're in trouble.

571
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
Oh, my back.

572
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,320
- You must try it at least once.
- What's Se Yoon doing?

573
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,950
You must try it again.

574
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,490
Oh, my back.

575
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,550
- You must try it at least once.
- What's Se Yoon doing?

576
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,720
(Se Yoon continues to play offense.)

577
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,730
- Great.
- That's how you do it.

578
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,730
(Seon Ho has
a good chance of winning.)

579
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,900
(He senses that he's in trouble.)

580
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,040
(He fights back
with every ounce of his power.)

581
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,170
You got it.

582
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,710
(What just happened?)

583
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,740
You got it.

584
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,150
(He sets the highest record.)

585
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,750
He's in first place.
His mark is higher than DinDin's.

586
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,390
(Then he heroically passes out.)

587
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,550
- You must do it again.
- Five, four,

588
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,560
- Hey, do it again.
- three,

589
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,820
- Oh, my back.
- two, one.

590
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,860
Gosh, I won!

591
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,460
- This is amazing.
- Se Yoon's record...

592
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,860
- Oh, my back.
- It's close to 1.1m.

593
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,460
- I won?
- Yes.

594
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,600
- How did I win?
- Your upper body came up.

595
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,800
But Se Yoon's upper body was
already 30cm higher...

596
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,870
because of his belly.

597
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,070
(Here comes Playful Yoo.)

598
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,410
- He's mocking you.
- My gosh. You...

599
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,080
He's mocking you because he lost.

600
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,180
That's it with you too.
You're Mocker Three.

601
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,880
- Okay. Watch out for the next one.
- Look. He's got a big body.

602
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,650
So he was already 30cm higher.

603
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,180
(Mockers of Se Yoon:
Numbers 1, 2, and 3)

604
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,250
Great.

605
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,120
DinDin and Se Yoon.
You'll advance to Round Three.

606
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,130
We'll play a round
to determine the loser.

607
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,160
Seriously. This is...

608
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,960
This will decide the loser.

609
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,700
Sae Ho, do you have a strategy?

610
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,430
I'll try to bounce up
as high as I can.

611
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,540
I'll bounce up higher than before.

612
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,440
- What about you, Seon Ho?
- My strategy is to win.

613
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,540
- Okay.
- Okay.

614
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,870
(His strategy is to win.)

615
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,180
Get ready!

616
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,810
(It's the last match of Round Two.)

617
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,810
Set...

618
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,150
I'll go up in one go.

619
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,650
In one go.

620
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,260
Great. Nice, Seon Ho.

621
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,560
Hey.

622
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,490
What are you doing, Sae Ho?

623
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,490
(Let's go, Sae Ho!)

624
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,830
(Sae Ho uses his legs
to bounce his upper body up.)

625
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,800
Sae Ho is winning.

626
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,000
- No. Seon Ho is winning.
- He's winning.

627
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,940
No. Seon Ho is winning.

628
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,970
- Seon Ho, you got this.
- My gosh.

629
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,470
(Did he injure his lymph nodes?)

630
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,110
Oh, no. It's your lymph nodes.

631
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,010
- Is it for real?
- Yes, it's for real. Hold on.

632
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,510
(Are you all right?)

633
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,150
- No.
- Wait. Don't move.

634
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,650
Are you okay?

635
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,980
- I'm not lying. Let's go.
- Are you okay?

636
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,720
- Stay there for a moment.
- He desperately wants to beat me.

637
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,990
(His strong will is impressive.)

638
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,690
Hurry up.

639
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,190
- Gosh. I feel bad for him.
- Darn it.

640
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,430
- It's making me tear up.
- Three!

641
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,200
(Trying to reach a higher spot)

642
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,770
(One of his hands
lets go of the pen.)

643
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,140
(Sensing trouble)
- Hey.
- What?

644
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,340
Hey. Seon Ho.

645
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,010
- Two, one.
- Hey, you lost.

646
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,210
- Wait. I...
- Sae Ho...

647
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,350
- What? When did you do that?
- My gosh.

648
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,050
Sae Ho, that's a foul.
You only used one hand.

649
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,320
- Really?
- You let go of the pen afterward.

650
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
- Really?
- Yes.

651
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,920
Are you okay?

652
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,690
I can't describe this
because there are ladies here.

653
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,490
Wait.
Your lymph nodes aren't in pain?

654
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,260
- It wasn't my lymph nodes.
- I see. Okay.

655
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,360
- I see.
- I thought my eggs would break.

656
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,400
- It wasn't about his lymph nodes.
- Seriously.

657
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,330
Seriously. I'm not joking.

658
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,670
When I lowered my upper body,

659
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,740
it felt like
someone punched me there.

660
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,540
(It hurt a lot.)

661
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,140
This is such a tough game to play!

662
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,210
(Laughing)

663
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,580
I was the best.

664
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,350
The final result of Round Two,
Fly, Upper Body.

665
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,150
Sae Ho is eliminated.

666
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,050
All right.

667
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,460
Se Yoon, DinDin,
and Seon Ho have survived for now.

668
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,490
- Okay.
- Yes.

669
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,960
- I can't believe...
- To win the full sleeping gear set,

670
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,500
the last mission is called...

671
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,260
Random Straw Game.

672
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,100
- What?
- Random Straw Game.

673
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,270
- The last round is about luck.
- It depends on luck.

674
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,440
What is this about?

675
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,640
- Is this the final game?
- Yes.

676
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,740
- There's only one winner?
- Yes.

677
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,840
- It's the last round.
- Okay.

678
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,210
- Goodness.
- What?

679
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,540
Two straws are connected
to sweet and sour red vinegar.

680
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,910
One straw is connected
to mineral water.

681
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,480
Choose one straw that's connected
to each plastic bottle...

682
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,950
and drink it up.

683
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,690
The one who drinks mineral water
will be the final winner.

684
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,220
It will be hit or miss.

685
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,890
Can't we tell by looking
at the straws?

686
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,660
- It's hard to tell.
- It's impossible.

687
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,860
- It's impossible to know.
- Right.

688
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,160
Let's just do it.

689
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,430
- Let's start.
- Which number will you pick?

690
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,330
- Tell us before you start.
- You can if there's no overlap.

691
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,330
- Tell us.
- Which number?

692
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,530
- What about you?
- What about you?

693
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,640
You tell me first.

694
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,070
Me?

695
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,840
- Number 3.
- I pick number 2.

696
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,270
- I pick number one. Okay.
- Let's go.

697
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,640
You won't change your mind,
will you?

698
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
- No.
- No, we won't.

699
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,910
I'm number one.

700
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,040
- I'm number 3.
- Seon Ho is number 2.

701
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,050
I'm number two.

702
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,980
This is hit or miss.

703
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,420
- We have to leave it to chance.
- Please.

704
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,650
- They can't tell.
- Please start.

705
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,290
- It's making me nervous.
- It's nerve-racking.

706
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,450
Please let me sleep alone tonight.

707
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,620
- Please.
- Start.

708
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,890
(Who will get to obtain
the full package?)

709
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,030
- Drink it up in one go.
- Go.

710
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,490
(The one who picks mineral water
wins the full package.)

711
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,730
One of them is drinking water.

712
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,970
(They've been working hard today
to win the bivouac gear.)

713
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,440
(They overcame their fear of heights
and flew in the sky.)

714
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
(Screaming)

715
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,540
(They overcame their fear of heights
and flew in the sky.)

716
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,010
(As expected on a hardcore show,)

717
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:08,950
(they plunged into the sea
without hesitation.)

718
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,290
(To top it all off,)

719
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,520
(they ended up rowing
against professional rowers today.)

720
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,760
(Exclaiming in pain)

721
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,430
(Bivouac gear
that they carefully collected...)

722
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,830
(by exchanging their underwear)

723
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,240
(And the last highlight)

724
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,840
(Who will be the final winner
to win the full package?)

725
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,370
(At that moment)

726
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,550
(You can hear the sound
of coughing everywhere.)

727
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,410
Everyone is acting.

728
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,650
I don't think Se Yoon
is drinking red vinegar.

729
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:42,990
(Will Sae Ho's guess be correct?)

730
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,020
All right.

731
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,660
Spit it out
if you can't take it anymore.

732
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,820
(Spitting)

733
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,890
Is yours red vinegar?

734
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,160
(DinDin is eliminated.)

735
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,130
(Seon Ho is eliminated.)

736
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,300
Moon Se Yoon wins.

737
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,330
(Moon Se Yoon is the final winner.)

738
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,000
He got very lucky at the end today.

739
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,600
Moon Se Yoon won...

740
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,140
- the full sleeping gear set.
- He won.

741
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,340
(Se Yoon gets to sleep
with the full package.)

742
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,580
I love you, Ha Na.

743
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,740
I've been picking number one
throughout the day.

744
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,910
Number one.

745
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,580
You may not realize this,
but I've only picked number one today.

746
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,780
(Se Yoon's wife's name
means "number one.")

747
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,780
Ha Na.

748
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,420
(Number 1)

749
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,690
(He also picked
Swim Ring Number One.)

750
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,290
(I pick number 1.)

751
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,390
(He also picked Straw Number One.)

752
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,690
(Even his microphone
was number one.)

753
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,330
I love you, Ha Na.

754
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,730
Ha Na.

755
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,930
- I've been picking only number one.
- Really?

756
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,470
(The losers are still shocked
by the red vinegar.)

757
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,670
- Really?
- It's stronger than normal vinegar.

758
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,310
- Sae Ho.
- My goodness.

759
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,040
Don't try it.

760
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,480
I love things like this.

761
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,780
But...

762
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
I like it very much.

763
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
- Really?
- Yes.

764
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
(It turns out that
Sae Ho loves the sour flavor.)

765
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,550
It's delicious.

766
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,450
(What's wrong with him?)

767
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,080
It tastes good
when mixed with water.

768
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,990
- That's true.
- How good is it?

769
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,060
- Try it, Joon.
- No thanks.

770
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,560
- Goodness!
- I don't want to try it.

771
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,790
(We added a bit of vinegar to it.)

772
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,230
You added vinegar to it?

773
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,860
- You added vinegar, didn't you?
- You added vinegar to it?

774
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,230
- That's why it stung my throat.
- I knew it.

775
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,630
Add more to it.

776
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,230
- You added vinegar to red vinegar?
- Add more.

777
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,970
I can't believe it.

778
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,170
I've never won a survival game.

779
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,170
(I can't believe that I won.)

780
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,040
(The unofficial winner, Joon,
who got eliminated in Round 1)

781
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,070
Can you believe this?

782
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,310
- All right.
- Let's go.

783
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,650
- Congratulations, Se Yoon.
- Thank you.

784
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,680
You may get ready to sleep.

785
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,120
- Thank you.
- Can we do this...

786
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,180
- before we end the shoot?
- What?

787
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,120
- The pool bed and air mattress.
- Yes.

788
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,850
- It will be a fight.
- We'll decide who gets what.

789
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,520
- Can you give us the die?
- The die, please.

790
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,290
- I'll give you the die.
- The one with the highest number?

791
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,460
- Yes, the highest number.
- Okay.

792
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,590
First place gets a pool bed...

793
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,700
- and a sleeping bag.
- Okay.

794
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,760
Second place gets an air mattress...

795
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,930
- and a sleeping bag.
- Okay.

796
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,530
Third place gets
the wooden bench and newspaper.

797
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,770
- Okay, that's it.
- Make it nice and neat.

798
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,200
(One man is free
from throwing the die.)

799
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,010
This is for me. Okay.

800
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,810
(It's fine as long as it's not me.)

801
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,280
- Who wants to go first?
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

802
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,450
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

803
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,710
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Hurry up.

804
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,810
- Anyone can go.
- I'll go first.

805
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,950
(The order of throwing the die)

806
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,680
- I'll go first.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

807
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,050
Go.

808
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,250
I must pray.

809
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,650
- I'm number 4.
- I'm number 2.

810
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,120
Wait a minute. I'm number four.

811
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
(While deciding the order)

812
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,160
- If you pick me as the winner...
- What's the order?

813
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,190
- Numbers 1, 2.
- Numbers 1, 2...

814
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,360
- I'll work hard.
- Numbers 3, 4.

815
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,030
I'll push myself harder...

816
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,170
- But you're not religious.
- Right, I have no religion.

817
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,140
I just have to wish
for it earnestly.

818
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,970
Hurry up, you celebrities.

819
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,340
(Pressured by the audience,
he throws the die.)

820
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:24,480
(Will Joon's prayer method work?)

821
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,920
What is it?

822
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,280
- Look at that.
- Hey, you.

823
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,690
Number one.

824
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,090
(Confirmed as the likely loser)

825
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,360
- That doesn't work.
- Joon.

826
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,220
You should believe in yourself.

827
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,090
Okay.

828
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,660
Did Joon get one?

829
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,860
It's the worst.

830
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,430
- He's the worst player today.
- Joon placed last.

831
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,000
I bet Sae Ho will throw two.

832
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,340
(I can't get 2.)

833
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,600
(He bows deeply at the die.)

834
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,340
Isn't there vinegar on the ground?

835
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,080
(The vinegar smell
hasn't faded yet.)

836
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,250
The vinegar smell came up
when I lowered myself.

837
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,810
I'll do it solemnly. Be quiet.

838
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,050
- Are you going to bow again?
- You bowed twice.

839
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,050
(Absolutely devastated)

840
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,550
- Are you going to bow again?
- You bowed twice.

841
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,620
(I won't bow twice.)

842
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,690
Okay.

843
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,460
(I pray.)

844
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,390
Even the sky will be touched.

845
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,060
The deity of red vinegar.

846
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,260
(The deity of red vinegar,
I pray for the pool bed.)

847
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,300
Let's go.

848
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,800
The pool bed.

849
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,740
He bowed twice.

850
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,040
(What will the deity
of red vinegar choose?)

851
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,140
What is it?

852
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,150
What is it?

853
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,250
(The deity of red vinegar chose 2.)

854
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,220
My prediction was accurate,
my friend.

855
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,880
Cho Sae Ho, number two.

856
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,190
Okay, I still have a chance.

857
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,660
(My goodness)

858
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,300
You need to perform a ritual.

859
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,230
Okay.

860
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,270
(Die, I beg you.)

861
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,730
- Gosh.
- A bed!

862
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,470
(What will DinDin's number be?)

863
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,970
Number one.

864
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,810
It's one.

865
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,710
(Will it be 1 as Se Yoon predicted?)

866
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,950
(Please!)

867
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:09,620
(One More Time)

868
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,720
(DinDin got the highest number
so far.)

869
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,260
(Thank you, die.)

870
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,860
I won the pool bed.

871
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,800
(Joon will definitely sleep
on the wooden bench.)

872
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,130
- Seon Ho hasn't gone yet.
- Seon Ho.

873
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,200
If Seon Ho throws a one,
I'll get the air mattress.

874
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,570
No way.

875
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,640
I pave my own way.

876
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,110
(Performing a ritual once more
for the last time)

877
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,610
I won't perform any ritual.

878
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,110
I pave my own way.

879
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,650
No one can stop me.

880
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,450
Throw a one.

881
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,550
(Please let it be 1.)

882
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,580
Throw a one.

883
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,690
(Desperate)

884
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,420
(What will be the number
for Seon Ho?)

885
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,760
He caught up.

886
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,130
(Seon Ho also throws 5.)

887
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,490
He caught up.

888
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,830
Okay, that's good.

889
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,660
(The two younger members
win high-quality items.)

890
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,600
Sae Ho is eliminated.

891
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,670
(Sae Ho will definitely sleep
on the wooden bench.)

892
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,470
Darn it.

893
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,870
(A spinning back kick with rage)

894
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,310
(Laughing)

895
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,280
What are you doing, Sae Ho?

896
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,740
That was your dressing room.

897
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,510
- What are you doing still up?
- Mister.

898
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,780
Mister, how could you...

899
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,950
What are you doing?

900
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,180
Stop shooting.
What are you shooting all day long?

901
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,690
The deity of red vinegar is furious.

902
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,520
You should've bowed more.

903
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,590
Why are you still up?
You know what time it is?

904
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,760
Wilderness, my foot.

905
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,200
Let's go, Joon.

906
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,000
Let's go, Joon.

907
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,160
(Joon can't go
because he's busy laughing.)

908
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,800
You don't want to go?
You want to stay a little longer?

909
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Okay.

910
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,400
It's my first time seeing
his spinning back kick.

911
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,070
- I apologize sincerely.
- Okay.

912
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,510
- I lost my temper.
- It happens.

913
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,910
Viewers, I apologize.

914
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,610
- I can understand.
- I'm sorry.

915
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,080
Okay.

916
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,320
Everyone,
please take your sleeping gear...

917
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,750
We'll take care of it ourselves.

918
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,850
It's not necessary to tell us that.

919
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,960
Wait, so who got what?

920
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,790
Did DinDin win the pool bed?

921
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,530
- I got the pool bed.
- What about Seon Ho?

922
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,930
- I got the air mattress.
- He got the air mattress.

923
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,030
Both of you got the wooden bench?

924
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,260
The wooden bench with newspaper.
Why are you asking when you know?

925
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,260
(The wooden bench and newspaper)

926
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,300
Who wants to set up my bed?

927
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,430
Me!

928
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,800
- Would you like...
- Yes, sir.

929
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,410
- It looks like I have a lot.
- I'll do it.

930
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,610
For my bed...
Wait, which area is even?

931
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,340
- An even area.
- An even area?

932
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,710
What do you think
of the red vinegar area?

933
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,250
- Red vinegar? No way.
- Okay.

934
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,510
Not where the red vinegar is.

935
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,280
Can you set it up over there
beautifully with the mosquito net?

936
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,520
- Where?
- What?

937
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,690
In my opinion, this area is good.

938
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,360
It seems to have a nice view too.

939
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,860
We need to spread this out first.

940
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,930
- Spread that out.
- And the cushions.

941
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,990
You have to spread everything out.

942
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,060
You don't need to do all that.

943
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,100
(The building owner,
Mr. Moon, has a lot.)

944
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,630
Gosh, this is difficult.

945
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,670
Don't crumple it.
It should be flat for my back.

946
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,940
Joon, pull it all the way...

947
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,370
- so that he can sleep well.
- Yes.

948
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,510
(Trying to sort things out quickly
for Landlord Moon's comfort)

949
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,010
- You have to set everything up.
- That's good.

950
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,780
- Have you never done it?
- Make it flat.

951
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,450
Spread it out. What are you doing?

952
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,480
Set up the blanket and everything.

953
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,850
Set up two layers.

954
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,020
Spread out the blanket.
What are you doing?

955
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,450
This is what happens when someone
who was penniless gets something.

956
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,660
This is all
for the purpose of sharing.

957
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,720
- Really?
- Of course.

958
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,490
Spread it out nicely.

959
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,560
How is this done?

960
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
This is...

961
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,730
You might have to sleep without it.

962
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,970
This is...

963
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,470
- There's no other solution.
- You lie down here.

964
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,940
There's no other solution.

965
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,440
Get up. What are you doing?

966
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,510
- What's wrong with you?
- There's really no other solution.

967
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,950
Try it until you make it.

968
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,720
You should give us
a proper mosquito net!

969
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,850
- I apologize.
- It's okay.

970
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,020
That's good. Spread it out.
I can't stand any wrinkles.

971
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,060
That looks great.

972
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,960
Come here, Sae Ho.

973
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,260
Let me pay your daily wage.

974
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,400
(Extremely polite)

975
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,530
- Is this for me?
- You should share it with him.

976
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,700
Hold it up together.

977
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,470
Let's take a commemorative photo.

978
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,870
(A photo commemorating
their daily wage)

979
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,870
(Daily wage)

980
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,940
- All right.
- Thank you.

981
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,010
Sleep well.

982
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,240
- Thank you.
- Sleep well.

983
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,910
Please remove your bags.

984
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,920
Why don't I try the bed
and see how it feels?

985
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,320
That's Seon Ho's bag.

986
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,490
- This is just...
- It feels wonderful.

987
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,860
- Wait.
- This is insane.

988
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,390
Wait.

989
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,030
(Landlord Moon locks the door.)

990
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,400
It does look nice.

991
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,200
(I'm jealous.)

992
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,400
Okay.

993
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,330
(The luxurious suite
with a mosquito net)

994
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,370
Gosh, it's hot.

995
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,140
Can we use the cardboard?

996
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,140
(The gap between
the rich and the poor)

997
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,440
- The cardboard.
- Go ahead and use it.

998
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:23,910
The cardboard...

999
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,240
(The cardboard is precious
to Team Wooden Bench.)

1000
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,110
Let's surround the bench
with the cardboard.

1001
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,750
- On top of this...
- This?

1002
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,110
Spread that out.

1003
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,550
Can we get some extra towels
so we can wash up?

1004
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,550
Sure.

1005
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,220
(Is he giving them for free?)

1006
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,860
Can we get some sleeping bags
so we can wash up?

1007
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,230
(That's not allowed.)

1008
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,560
- No?
- No.

1009
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,300
(As it's the Bivouac Special,
they wash up at the faucet.)

1010
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,540
(He washes himself alone
with the long hose.)

1011
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,540
(It's uncomfortable.)

1012
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,270
Could you film
while holding this up?

1013
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,370
Sure.

1014
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,610
(He's happy to help.)

1015
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,450
(Thanks to the director,
he can wash his face with two hands.)

1016
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,650
I can only wash my face.

1017
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,090
(Se Yoon and Seon Ho
hold the hose for each other.)

1018
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,090
Water.

1019
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,420
(Hold the hose properly.)

1020
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,120
I need water.

1021
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
(I don't want to.)

1022
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:15,990
Water!

1023
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,190
(Giggling)

1024
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,500
Pour the water into my hands.

1025
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,930
I did. Is it not reaching?

1026
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,930
Pour it well.

1027
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,370
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1028
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,470
(The revolutionary,
wiping with half the towel)

1029
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,070
You seem very close to each other.

1030
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,410
I'm done.

1031
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,910
- We're each other's other half.
- We are.

1032
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,510
- Are you done?
- You're my other half

1033
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,380
I'll use the remaining water...

1034
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,450
on my feet
that were wet with red vinegar.

1035
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,950
(Washing red vinegar off his feet)

1036
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:41,950
That's done.

1037
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,950
- The end.
- We're done. I feel refreshed.

1038
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,760
(Applying lotion meticulously)

1039
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,300
Sae Ho. He's 44.

1040
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,900
And he asked me to cover him
with the newspaper.

1041
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,440
Yes, thank you.

1042
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,700
- Will you take a photo of me?
- I will.

1043
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,910
- With your phone?
- Yes, I'll send it to you.

1044
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,410
(Somewhere between bivouacking
and sleeping on the street)

1045
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,410
Sleep well.

1046
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,850
- Good night, Sae Ho.
- Good night.

1047
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,150
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

1048
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,280
(They lie down in the most
comfortable position at their spot.)

1049
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,920
(They fall asleep with the vast sky
as their blanket.)

1050
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,600
(Soon, the morning arrives.)

1051
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:34,500
(The sun is already high in the sky,
but the members are still asleep.)

1052
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,670
(They're sleeping well
even though it's outdoors.)

1053
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,780
(Sae Ho gets up at 7:50 a.m.)

1054
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,150
(He's the only one who woke up
before the wake-up song.)

1055
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,750
(They're both still sleeping.)

1056
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,730
(What are those?)

1057
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,470
(He spots something
and goes up to it.)

1058
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,170
(Microphones and cameras
on the grass)

1059
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,380
(And a letter?)

1060
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,210
Guys.

1061
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,550
You'd better get up.

1062
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,590
- They left these here.
- What?

1063
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,320
(Half-asleep)

1064
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,130
They left everything,
including the microphones.

1065
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,390
What's written on it?

1066
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,330
(What's written in the letter?)

1067
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,770
"Hello members,
did you sleep well last night?"

1068
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,340
"I'm sure
everyone wants to go home."

1069
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,270
"You must catch me
in order to get off work."

1070
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,910
I'm over here. Please hurry.

1071
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,080
All members must come together.

1072
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,220
(They must catch Director Joo
to get off work?)

1073
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,720
There's no one here. Everyone left.

1074
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,750
Gosh.

1075
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,960
(No one is here
other than the members?)

1076
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,960
(1 hour ago)

1077
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,660
(Shadows move busily with the
sleeping members behind them.)

1078
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,770
(The staff members
are leaving with their things.)

1079
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,200
(On top of that)

1080
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,640
(Bowing)

1081
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:23,480
(Director Joo cajoled the sleeping members
before leaving.)

1082
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,620
(And he checked out.)

1083
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:32,250
(Soon, the base camp became empty.)

1084
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,330
(They must find Director Joo
who disappeared.)

1085
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,060
(What?)

1086
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,130
- If everyone left,
- Yes?

1087
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,860
should we leave too?

1088
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,530
(Thinking outside the box)

1089
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,730
Shall we? That's an idea.

1090
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,640
That's a great idea.

1091
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,600
(Why didn't we think
of that before?)

1092
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,640
That sounds good.

1093
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,940
(How will they catch Director Joo?)

1094
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,580
What? How do we know?

1095
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,580
The sea.

1096
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,220
Look carefully. Isn't this the sea?

1097
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,780
It could be.

1098
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,320
(Another trace left by Director Joo)

1099
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,260
I'm over here. Please hurry.

1100
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,260
(Director Joo has a big smile on
with a victory sign.)

1101
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,630
(Where could he be?)

1102
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,500
(It looks like he's by the sea.)

1103
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,440
- We received a hint.
- What?

1104
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,110
- As a text message?
- From whom?

1105
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,710
What is it?

1106
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,740
- Listen to it.
- Okay.

1107
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,450
(Playing the audio hint)

1108
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,220
(What is this sound?)

1109
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,250
That's right.

1110
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,920
(Replay)

1111
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,560
(Do you recognize this sound?)

1112
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,430
Isn't he running?

1113
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,830
It's the zipline.

1114
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,400
- You're right.
- I see.

1115
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
Can you play it again?

1116
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,740
(The sound of zipline)

1117
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,200
(It sounds similar.)

1118
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,910
- You're right.
- Right?

1119
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,280
- That's right.
- Right.

1120
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,210
- Your intuition is sharp.
- Nice.

1121
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,750
- Right?
- That's good.

1122
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,650
There's something called
Daecheon Ziptrek.

1123
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,350
- It must be right.
- This is it.

1124
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,820
You probably see it
when you glide from the top.

1125
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,820
(A photo that Sae Ho found
on someone's blog)

1126
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,590
They look similar.

1127
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,360
- They took the photo from the top.
- It must be the zipline.

1128
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,660
- Don't you think this is it?
- Yes.

1129
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,560
That's good.

1130
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,030
You're smart.

1131
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,630
- Shall we put on the microphone?
- Microphone?

1132
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,000
(Experienced)

1133
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,640
This can't be helped.

1134
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,110
(Professional TV personalities know
how to put on their microphones.)

1135
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,440
Is this done like this?

1136
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,610
(He doesn't forget
to take the camera.)

1137
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:38,050
So far, we've figured out
that he's by the zipline.

1138
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,680
We have been abandoned.

1139
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,750
(Joon's Camera)

1140
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,150
(Moving to the van
while filming themselves)

1141
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,820
Let's get going.

1142
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,890
(Will they catch Director Joo
and get off work?)

1143
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,590
The address is...
This has to be the place, right?

1144
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,700
I think so.

1145
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,800
It will take 37 minutes.

1146
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,830
Then let's go to Daecheon Ziptrek.

1147
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,340
Okay.

1148
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,940
If he isn't there...

1149
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,970
- After 40 minutes...
- It'd be a disaster.

1150
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,510
- Or...
- If not, let's just drive home.

1151
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,510
(Reckless)

1152
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,680
(Just in case,
he listens to it again.)

1153
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,880
It has to be the zipline.

1154
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,480
- It must be the zipline.
- Yes.

1155
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,580
(Feeling certain)

1156
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,190
(Will their guess be correct?)

1157
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,420
The weather is beautiful today.

1158
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,890
Did you all sleep well?

1159
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,960
It wasn't bad,
but it wasn't comfortable either.

1160
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,930
It could have been worse.

1161
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,600
How was the wooden bench?
I think Joon slept soundly.

1162
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,930
I passed out.

1163
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,340
- It wasn't the perfect bed, but...
- It was okay.

1164
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,770
- Joon said the right thing.
- What?

1165
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,140
"If they left, should we leave too?"

1166
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,080
We can leave with this van.

1167
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,080
He said, "If there's no one here,
let's just leave."

1168
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,280
I'll drop off each of you.

1169
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,480
Send him a message.

1170
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,220
"Come and catch us instead."

1171
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,590
(Come and catch us instead.)

1172
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,920
- We can send him photos.
- That's right.

1173
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,190
Or how about this?

1174
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,960
We all have mobile phones.

1175
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,200
We could go to a gukbap restaurant.

1176
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,300
We can pay with a money transfer.

1177
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,670
I can pay with Apple Pay.

1178
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,030
I have one too.

1179
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,670
We can go to a delicious
gukbap restaurant in Daecheon.

1180
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,900
No one is following us, right?

1181
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,170
- No, there's no one.
- You're right.

1182
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,340
(No one is following them.)

1183
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,940
(That means...)

1184
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,510
- No one is following us.
- No one is behind us.

1185
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,080
No one is in the trunk, right?

1186
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,980
- There's no car behind us.
- No car is following us.

1187
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,980
(Is that so?)

1188
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,190
Shall we show them?

1189
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,790
No one is behind us.

1190
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,560
- I'm ready.
- What?

1191
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,960
Joon is capable of it.

1192
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,560
Joon is a man of his word.

1193
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,990
The staff made a mistake.

1194
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,860
We're like unleashed dogs.

1195
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,360
(Glaring)

1196
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,900
I’m afraid that it would lead
to consequences later.

1197
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,000
For doing something on our own
on a real wild road variety show.

1198
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,910
- "As you made a mistake..."
- Sae Ho.

1199
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,640
It's the real wild
because they unleashed us.

1200
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,810
They don't know
when we would find him.

1201
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,780
Isn't it awkward to go there
after eating?

1202
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,880
We might make the staff wait
for too long.

1203
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,490
Sae Ho.

1204
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,190
Did Joo Jong Hyun give you
a mission?

1205
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,390
Are you in secret communication
with Director Joo?

1206
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,060
- No way.
- He's acting strange.

1207
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,390
Sae Ho is acting suspicious.

1208
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,900
- Cho Sae Ho.
- Yes?

1209
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,830
You got up suddenly in the morning.

1210
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,900
You were the first person
to find the message.

1211
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,130
(Sae Ho was the first one
to find the mission.)

1212
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,940
I'm serious. Watch this on TV
when it gets aired.

1213
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,870
As soon as I opened my eyes...
I was on the wooden bench.

1214
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,540
When I opened my eyes,

1215
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,210
I saw the letter,
so I told you guys. That's all.

1216
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,410
But you keep talking
like you're worried...

1217
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,180
- No.
- about the staff.

1218
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,050
- If we're going to do something...
- Yes?

1219
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,050
I mean, we're doing it
to show them what we can do.

1220
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,950
Then shouldn't we just go home?

1221
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,090
Having breakfast doesn't sound
so rebellious, don't you think?

1222
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,090
(That's extreme.)

1223
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,490
- You think we should go home?
- But going home...

1224
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:37,790
This is how it feels, Sae Ho.

1225
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:40,700
- Eating on our way can be cute.
- Right.

1226
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,230
- They could just laugh it away.
- Yes.

1227
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
But if we go home...

1228
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,100
Based on what I've seen
in the past six years,

1229
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,870
- I don't think it will end well.
- Right.

1230
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,070
(Even the sly DinDin seems
afraid of the consequences.)

1231
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,780
- Hey, there's McDonald's.
- What?

1232
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,780
They have a drive-thru there.

1233
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,150
- Where is it?
- On the left.

1234
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,950
It's on me.
Let's eat some food in the car.

1235
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,580
Shall we eat in the car?

1236
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,150
- Shall we eat on our way there?
- Let's do that.

1237
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,820
- Okay. Let's do that.
- I don't think they'll find out.

1238
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,160
(Chuckling)

1239
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,560
- You have to make a turn here.
- Oh, I should make a left turn.

1240
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,130
(They head
straight to the burger place.)

1241
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,530
- This is nice.
- The morning menu... Hold on.

1242
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,860
- All right. Tell me what you want.
- What can I get you?

1243
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,930
Hello.

1244
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,200
Can we get one chicken snack wrap...

1245
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,740
and four hash browns?

1246
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,940
I'll have a sausage and egg McGriddle
with iced coffee.

1247
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,810
Can we also get
a chicken cheese muffin...

1248
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,070
One cup of iced drip coffee,

1249
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,280
one cup of Diet Coke,

1250
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
and one cup of chocolate milkshake,
please.

1251
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,340
And one cup of orange juice too,
please.

1252
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,980
(The members order a lot of food,
being unstrained.)

1253
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,120
- The payment went through.
- Thank you.

1254
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,350
(It's Sae Ho's treat.)

1255
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,650
(Cheering)

1256
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,090
- He's so nice, as always.
- Thank you.

1257
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,490
What are you guys cheering for?

1258
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,320
A drive-thru is so nice.

1259
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,930
- The world got so much better.
- This is what I'm talking about.

1260
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,930
All right. We're going to eat.

1261
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,700
- Goodbye.
- I'll distribute the food now.

1262
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,830
Please do.

1263
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,770
(He has a sip
of his chocolate milkshake.)

1264
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,800
- My, this is so good.
- That's mine.

1265
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,570
The staff made a huge mistake...

1266
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,540
by leaving us unattended like this.

1267
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,180
(Eating)

1268
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,110
(They're enjoying breakfast
without playing a game after a long time.)

1269
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,180
I'm happy.

1270
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,750
- I feel like we're on a trip.
- Exactly.

1271
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,420
We're all on the same boat now.

1272
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:11,950
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

1273
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:15,290
- Of course, we are one.
- If they ask us if we ate food,

1274
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,230
we just have to be shameless...

1275
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,890
and deny their accusation
all together.

1276
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,430
If Jong Min were here,
he would've admitted it.

1277
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:23,800
- Without him, we can fool them.
- Right.

1278
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,000
We'll just say we feel wronged.

1279
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,200
I'll get angry and act resentful.

1280
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,400
- Good.
- I'll say it in an annoyed tone.

1281
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,470
- I can do that.
- Okay. Good.

1282
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:30,940
Let's hurry up and catch him
so we can go home.

1283
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,310
(Let's hurry up and catch Jong Hyun
so we can go home.)

1284
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,210
(Only 2 minutes before arrival)

1285
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,940
We should start
getting rid of the evidence.

1286
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:37,680
We don't have to do that.

1287
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,650
We can just say we didn't eat it.

1288
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,020
We can say it was in the car
when we got in.

1289
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,450
(They're becoming
more and more brazen.)

1290
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,450
"Oh, wait.
What are those in the car?"

1291
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:47,160
(Dreaming of a perfect crime,
they arrive at the destination.)

1292
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,190
- We're almost there now.
- What's that?

1293
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,360
By the way, Joon is good at driving.

1294
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,030
That's because Joon had to give
paparazzi the slip many times.

1295
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,400
(Laughing)

1296
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,970
Such experience helped him
improve his driving skills.

1297
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,340
- That's not true.
- No one can chase him.

1298
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,910
I see the zipline over there.

1299
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,210
- Look up there. It's very high.
- Oh, I see that too.

1300
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,580
- All right. Everyone...
- That's such a high zipline.

1301
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,010
Joon, I'll catch him,
and you fly kick him.

1302
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,180
- Got it.
- He might try to run away.

1303
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,280
- All right. I'll do that.
- There's a parking lot here.

1304
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,450
Well, this will be...

1305
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,990
- Isn't that Director Joo?
- Hold on.

1306
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,690
He's at the parking lot?
I should park the car here.

1307
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,860
(They get out of the car
to go and catch Director Joo.)

1308
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,660
(We left everything to them.
They have such poor filming skills.)

1309
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,170
I don't think I'm supposed to
film myself with this camera.

1310
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,800
- We should film one another.
- Should we film one another?

1311
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,970
- All right.
- What are you doing?

1312
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,070
All right.

1313
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,440
What are you doing?
Are you sure you're filming me?

1314
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,310
- Hello. Have a nice day.
- Hello.

1315
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,710
Thank you.

1316
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,950
Are we going the right way?
Oh, this is it.

1317
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,950
- I think... Wait.
- Are we at the right place?

1318
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,550
- Is that man Jong Hyun?
- You're moving too fast.

1319
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,090
- No, that's not Jong Hyun.
- Of course not.

1320
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:53,060
- Where should we go to catch him?
- I think he's on the other side.

1321
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,760
- I think we should go up there.
- We should go up there.

1322
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,790
Are we going up there?

1323
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:56,960
Let's go and find out.

1324
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,830
- That's right.
- Hey, look here.

1325
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,860
Guys, look. There's a camera here.

1326
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,770
- Oh, okay.
- There's a camera here.

1327
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:07,340
- Right. That's the beach we saw.
- That's right.

1328
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,840
- Wait. Where does this lead to?
- I see the camera.

1329
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,670
Do we have to go all the way down
over there?

1330
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,240
But it's quite steep.

1331
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,410
- It's almost like a free fall.
- But where is Jong Hyun?

1332
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:16,450
Let's go up and find him.

1333
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,380
I think he's up there.

1334
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,650
(Will Director Joo be on top
of the tower?)

1335
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

1336
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,920
- Hello.
- By any chance, do you know...

1337
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,560
- where our cameramen are?
- I think that's Jong Hyun.

1338
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,060
They took the elevator earlier.

1339
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,300
- Really? Did they go up?
- I see. Did they go up?

1340
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,460
- Thank you.
- So they went up. Thank you.

1341
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,770
So you jump off a 52m tower?

1342
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,570
There's a weight limit
for the zipline, right?

1343
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,400
- This may be the tallest one.
- We don't get to come here often.

1344
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,770
- There's no weight limit.
- Really?

1345
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:44,240
I think this is the highest zipline
in the country.

1346
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,740
Is there really no weight limit?
Please tell us the truth.

1347
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,710
No, you can ride it
as long as the safety gear fits you.

1348
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,510
(Will I have
to ride something again?)

1349
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1350
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,250
I don't want to
ride anything anymore.

1351
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,790
(Tearing up)

1352
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,350
(Technology is advancing
so quickly.)

1353
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,560
We've been doing a lot of activities
since yesterday.

1354
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,590
- Yes. One after another.
- We did a lot of activities.

1355
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,360
I've never ridden a zipline
at 9 a.m. before.

1356
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,500
We've been experiencing
real outdoor activities.

1357
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,570
It's the 19th floor.

1358
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,130
Seon Ho contributed a lot.

1359
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,600
He guessed the zipline sound
once he heard it.

1360
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,870
- He was so smart.
- Right?

1361
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,370
- You see...
- Yes. He used to be an idol singer.

1362
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,510
- You're now officially one of us.
- Hello.

1363
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,310
(If Director Joo is here,
everything will be successful.)

1364
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,280
- Okay.
- We're here.

1365
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,380
- You're now officially one of us.
- Hello.

1366
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,020
- Okay.
- We're here.

1367
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,250
- Oh, what...
- Oh, gosh.

1368
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,820
- What's going on?
- But Jong Hyun can't ride it.

1369
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,990
- What's going on?
- You must catch me to end it.

1370
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:34,890
- I know you can't ride it.
- Get him. What are you waiting for?

1371
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:35,890
Goodness, Jong Hyun.

1372
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,360
How long have you been
hanging there?

1373
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,430
(The safety door opens.)

1374
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,030
(Is he going to ride it
to run away?)

1375
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,500
(You must catch me to end it.)

1376
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,100
(Catch him.
What are you waiting for?)

1377
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,800
- What? Hey, wait.
- You must catch me to end it.

1378
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,540
- What? Hey!
- Oh, gosh.

1379
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,040
(Screaming)

1380
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,740
(They lost their target
right in front of their eyes.)

1381
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,240
(Laughing)

1382
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,280
What's that?

1383
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,110
For how many hours
was he hanging here?

1384
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,980
(Around the time the members
picked up their food...)

1385
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:01,980
One for me.

1386
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,320
(Even though he gets scared easily,)

1387
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,220
(Director Joo was hanging here
for nearly 30 minutes...)

1388
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,390
(because he didn't know
when the members would come.)

1389
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,660
I'm surprised. I thought
he couldn't ride a zipline.

1390
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,930
(Director Joo escapes
while screaming resentfully.)

1391
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,470
(The scaredy-cat main director
sacrifices himself for the show.)

1392
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,210
Is this really necessary?
He can't ride things like this.

1393
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,110
(We should go too.
We must ride it to catch him.)

1394
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,250
Let's stop
doing activities like this.

1395
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,720
(I might just go home now!)

1396
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,020
This is driving me nuts.

1397
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:44,030
(All members have put on
the safety gear.)

1398
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,930
What? Oh, gosh.
It's open only in front of me.

1399
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:47,160
- That scared me.
- We'll double-check the gear.

1400
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,330
(I'm ready to catch Director Joo.)

1401
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:50,100
(Sae Ho and Seon Ho
will ride it together.)

1402
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,230
How many activities must we do?

1403
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,240
(Director Joo,
just wait until I catch you.)

1404
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,770
When I count to three,
just lift up your feet.

1405
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,970
- One, two, three. Go!
- All right.

1406
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,280
- I'm scared.
- So this is how it moves.

1407
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,480
(Exclaiming)

1408
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:06,150
(I'm scared.)

1409
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,120
(I'm doing another activity
for the fourth time.)

1410
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,590
(Smiling)

1411
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,160
(Let's go.)

1412
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,800
So this is how it moves.

1413
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:29,940
(They fly like an arrow
with the wind blowing on their backs.)

1414
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,870
- So this is how the beach looks.
- Right.

1415
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,810
- It's pretty.
- Nice.

1416
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,410
- We're moving really fast.
- Yes, we are.

1417
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:38,850
(I'm on cloud nine.)

1418
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,790
(The members are flying fast
up above the blue sea.)

1419
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,660
I can smell the sea.

1420
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:56,000
(A morning zipline at 9 a.m.
is also amazing.)

1421
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,800
(It's really amazing!)

1422
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:09,110
(The Bivouac Race took place
in Boryeong and Buyeo.)

1423
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:20,160
(During the dazzling trip,
they fully enjoyed the summer days.)

1424
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,260
(19 seconds later, we'll see
the hidden nature on Jeju Island...)

1425
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,300
(with Jong Min who came back
from his honeymoon!)

1426
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,400
(All members have landed.)

1427
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,500
- Catch him.
- I caught him.

1428
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,070
(They also succeeded
in catching Director Joo.)

1429
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,140
(2 Days and 1 Night)

1430
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,040
(The tall Mount Halla)

1431
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,680
(The blue sea)

1432
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,450
(And beautiful stone walls
welcome you.)

1433
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,480
(We're here on Jeju Island.)

1434
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,150
(The first destination of the trip
to the beautiful Jeju Island)

1435
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,920
- My, the sand is so soft.
- How beautiful.

1436
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,160
Is this Gimnyeong Beach?

1437
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,860
- Gimnyeong Beach.
- The color of the water is amazing.

1438
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,060
Gimnyeong Beach.

1439
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,400
Oh, my. Look at the sea.

1440
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,970
- It's magnificent.
- It's so beautiful.

1441
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,470
(Sae Ho is in front of Se Yoon.)

1442
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,970
Here comes 1 of the top 5 men
Jong Min picked. Go behind me.

1443
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,940
- That's annoying.
- All right.

1444
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,510
That hurt my feelings last night.

1445
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,780
Nice to meet you all.
This is Jeju Island.

1446
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,080
Hello. Are you here for your work?

1447
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,120
(It looks like Se Yoon's
in a good mood.)

1448
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,490
- Hello.
- Why are you so late?

1449
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,890
I'm the only one here who was voted
as Jong Min's top five members...

1450
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:27,920
of the show.

1451
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,090
- Right, I saw that.
- You didn't get his credit.

1452
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,130
- You should work harder.
- I mean...

1453
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,900
The four of us last night...

1454
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,930
We turned on the TV at the lodging
after having dinner.

1455
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:41,200
- "Problem Child in House" was on.
- Right.

1456
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,540
Jong Min was on the show.
We were having fun watching it.

1457
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,910
Then they showed
the top five members...

1458
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,980
of 2 Days and 1 Night
picked by Jong Min.

1459
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,680
We were all nervous.

1460
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,710
- It was like an awards ceremony.
- Right.

1461
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,880
- "The first winner is..."
- Eun Ji Won.

1462
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,720
- Of course.
- He deserves it.

1463
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,720
- Of course.
- The second winner is Lee Seung Gi.

1464
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:01,060
- Of course.
- He surely is the winner.

1465
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,990
- The third winner is Cha Tae Hyun.
- Sure, he has to be the winner.

1466
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,960
I thought it was time for him
to mention one of us.

1467
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,230
- "The 4th one should be us."
- The 4th one was...

1468
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,930
(It was a nervous moment announcing
the 4th top member of the show.)

1469
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:12,130
(Please call my name.)

1470
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,140
(The 4th member picked by Jong Min
was Kim Joon Ho.)

1471
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,640
- "It's Kim Joon Ho."
- Right.

1472
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,540
That's when Se Yoon
started to make a face.

1473
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,410
He said, "I'm not the fourth one?"

1474
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:24,880
- We all made a face. Come on.
- That's when I realized,

1475
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,950
- "Only one slot is vacant."
- Right.

1476
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,320
Just one more person.

1477
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,150
(Will he say 1 of the members
from Season 4?)

1478
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,620
This is getting interesting.

1479
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,660
(Jong Min picked Se Yoon as
1 of the top 5 members.)

1480
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,130
They announced Se Yoon's name.

1481
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,700
We all frowned as if they announced
the winner of the Grand Prize.

1482
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,230
(The rest of them got all angry.)

1483
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,600
The three of them were frowning
so much.

1484
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,270
They said, "I'm going to confront
Jong Min when he comes back."

1485
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:48,240
That really put me down a bit.

1486
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,310
- Then Sae Ho went to his room.
- Right away.

1487
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:53,010
- Really? I watched it too.
- I went to my room right away.

1488
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,240
I cried while taking a shower.

1489
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,950
- How did you cry?
- I cried like this.

1490
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:59,080
(Crying)

1491
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,050
I didn't want them
to hear me crying.

1492
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:03,420
You should ask him
when he comes back.

1493
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,750
- Ask the worst five members.
- Let's do that.

1494
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,720
- Worst five members.
- Here he comes.

1495
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:11,130
I smell Europe on Jeju Island.

1496
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,660
(Jeering)

1497
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,200
Hey, Jong Min.

1498
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,170
My best friend, Jong Min.

1499
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,900
- I'm 1 of the best 5.
- What do you mean?

1500
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,900
You picked me in fifth place.

1501
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,910
I did?

1502
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,570
- "I did?"
- Did he say, "I did?"

1503
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,640
- You don't remember that?
- Boo.

1504
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,810
- Stand in the center.
- I mean this is...

1505
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,180
This is much better
than Switzerland.

1506
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:35,150
- You can stand here.
- The weather is amazing.

1507
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,220
- Goodness.
- Hello.

1508
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,890
Jong Min is back.

1509
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,620
Jong Min is back in Korea.

1510
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,720
(Jong Min is back.)

1511
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,060
- Hey, did you...
- We aren't so happy.

1512
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,330
- Why not?
- Last night, we watched...

1513
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:49,330
- Don't ask him.
- Do you even remember?

1514
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,670
- Remember what?
- You on "Problem Child in House."

1515
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:52,700
- I was on the show.
- Right.

1516
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,940
You picked the top five members
of the show.

1517
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,010
Right.

1518
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,540
Unfortunately,
we watched that episode...

1519
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,340
all together last night.

1520
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,980
So we are very angry right now.

1521
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,080
(You didn't pick us?)

1522
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,950
What's the point of shooting
the show together?

1523
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,080
Wasn't it fun, though?

1524
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,990
It just ruined my mood instantly.

1525
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,690
- I'm fine, Jong Min.
- Wasn't it fun?

1526
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:15,890
Let me explain.
You didn't get the whole context.

1527
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,390
- Really?
- Let me explain.

1528
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,560
It was all edited.

1529
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,900
A soccer match is weird
if all of them are Messi.

1530
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:24,330
- What?
- What do you mean?

1531
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,370
- Not everyone can be a striker?
- That's right.

1532
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:30,110
We need a defender and a goalkeeper.

1533
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:32,340
We need people of a variety.
This season's team is the best.

1534
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,080
You can't jump like that.

1535
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,110
(That is so random.)

1536
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,110
- What kind of excuse is that?
- What are you talking about?

1537
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,580
This is what we want to know.

1538
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,280
You can pick the worst five members
of the show then.

1539
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:41,950
Who are the worst five members?

1540
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,050
- I can't wait to hear it.
- It would be fun.

1541
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,120
- This sounds fun.
- I'm sure this will attract...

1542
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,120
more attention than the best five.

1543
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,920
I can already picture
about two people in my head.

1544
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,890
- You know who?
- Of course.

1545
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:50,990
Of course, I do.

1546
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:52,890
You're one of them. Did you know?

1547
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,900
(You're one of them.)

1548
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,130
- We should end it here.
- That's too sudden for him.

1549
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:58,230
- We shouldn't pick the worst ones.
- Right.

1550
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:00,070
- Just pick one more member.
- Top six members.

1551
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,500
- Top six.
- Sixth place.

1552
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,610
- Pick sixth place and move on.
- Sixth place?

1553
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,510
- Sixth place.
- Personally?

1554
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,940
- Of all the members combined.
- Right.

1555
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,880
- Just until 6th place.
- Just 1 more person.

1556
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,310
Se Yoon is in fifth place.

1557
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,310
- That's right.
- Let's wrap it up there.
Sixth place.

1558
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:13,750
- Members from all seasons combined.
- Be honest.

1559
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,580
- Be honest.
- Sae Ho's also very good...

1560
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,720
(Will he pick
1 of the 4 people here?)

1561
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,890
- I know you all are good.
- All seasons combined.

1562
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,220
- It hasn't been long...
- Right.

1563
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,520
So I'll pick DinDin.

1564
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,660
- I mean it.
- I could tell.

1565
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,230
How about seventh place?

1566
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,400
Seventh place?

1567
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,600
(Being clingy)

1568
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,600
Okay, then it's Sae Ho.
(Sae Ho is 1 of the top 7.)

1569
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,100
Okay, it's Sae Ho.
It hasn't even been a year.

1570
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,570
(I shouldn't have asked.)

1571
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:38,970
It surely feels more stable...

1572
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,640
- when we have Jong Min with us.
- That's right.

1573
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,710
It's nice to have all of us here.

1574
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:42,810
Was your trip fun?

1575
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,310
- Was it fun?
- Let me be honest.

1576
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,710
I was so happy.
The trip was so nice.

1577
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,380
It's your first proper vacation.

1578
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,750
- That's right.
- You knew we were filming...

1579
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,320
the show while you were
on your honeymoon.

1580
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,490
- I knew.
- How did you feel?

1581
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,060
For me, I was more like...

1582
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,120
I felt anxious.

1583
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:58,590
"Will the show be okay without me?"
I was more worried.

1584
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,230
Honestly, I wasn't worried at all.

1585
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,900
We also made a video call.

1586
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,930
How did you feel?

1587
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,570
I trusted that you guys
were doing your best.

1588
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:08,440
So I was not worried at all.

1589
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,370
I feel like he's changed.

1590
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,110
- He's more relaxed now.
- Right, I'm more relaxed.

1591
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,640
Now that Jong Min is back with us,

1592
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,980
let's go on a special trip today.

1593
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,250
- Okay.
- Jeju Island.

1594
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,050
We are dressed up...

1595
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,750
- like some expeditionists.
- I know.

1596
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:22,950
They told me to dress up like this.

1597
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,820
I could tell right away.

1598
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:26,860
We're going to some jungle, right?

1599
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,220
- He's at it again.
- Like Indiana Jones.

1600
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,190
We're paddling
next to some crocodiles.

1601
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:32,230
Crocodiles?

1602
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:33,900
- Crocodiles on Jeju Island?
- I just have one question.

1603
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,030
Do we have to get ready?

1604
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:37,000
You should always get ready
before filming the show.

1605
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,600
- In fact, yesterday...
- Is it like a travel show?

1606
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,340
Seon Ho and I arrived yesterday.

1607
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,710
It's nice to run around
the coastal area on Jeju.

1608
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,710
- Did you run yesterday?
- We ran about 15km.

1609
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:47,710
(DinDin and Seon Ho ran
on the coastal road.)

1610
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,140
That's the farthest I ran.

1611
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,710
Then we made a video call
to Jong Hyun...

1612
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,110
while we were running.

1613
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,980
Then he said, "Hey!
Go back to your hotel and rest."

1614
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:57,890
"Go back to your hotel right now."

1615
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,520
"Save your energy."

1616
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,860
- "What are you doing?"
- "What do you think you're doing?"

1617
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,190
"I told you to get some rest."

1618
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:04,590
He said, "What are you doing?"

1619
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,560
- I mean...
- So I'm a bit anxious.

1620
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,260
Are we going on a tough trip
or something?

1621
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,130
- What is it? Tell us right now.
- Not many places are bad here.

1622
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:12,330
You see how you're dressed up.

1623
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:15,370
- You're ready to explore now.
- He's saying...

1624
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,870
Today, you are...

1625
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:20,710
designated as
Tamra Treasure Expeditioners.

1626
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,280
- I love it.
- Tamra?

1627
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,910
- Tamra is Jeju Island.
- That's right.

1628
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:27,480
We're going to explore this place.

1629
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:30,450
Embracing the blue sea
and natural beauty,

1630
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,490
Jeju Island.

1631
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,620
- I love it.
- It's amazing.

1632
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:38,230
This year marks
the Visit Jeju Heritage Year.

1633
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,790
The government designated it.

1634
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,260
(To us,)

1635
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,170
(it's a familiar and friendly spot.)

1636
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,430
(Jeju Island)

1637
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:47,200
(Only it's not familiar and friendly
this time.)

1638
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,540
- The road is...
- Hey, this is...

1639
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,640
Is this even a road?

1640
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,440
(Something we haven't seen before.)

1641
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,150
We're going to see
a new side of Jeju Island...

1642
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,510
by visiting places
that haven't been known.

1643
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:04,150
(On their way
to this new Jeju Island)

1644
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:07,190
So the concept of today's trip is...

1645
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,360
to find hidden treasures
of Jeju Island.

1646
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:13,860
(Finding hidden treasures
of Jeju Island)

1647
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,730
Adventure trip special.

1648
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,430
(Novice explorers'...)

1649
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:22,140
(adventure trip special)

1650
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,010
Tamra Treasure Island.

1651
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,070
(Tamra Treasure Island:
Adventure Trip Special)

1652
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,510
It sounds very interesting.

1653
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,240
It's like we are
at an amusement park.

1654
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,550
It sounds very interesting.
It's fun to look for treasures.

1655
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,750
It's a group mission.

1656
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:35,020
You're going to explore
all over Jeju Island today.

1657
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,920
- When you complete your mission...
- Yes?

1658
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:39,650
- Treasures?
- If you find your treasures...

1659
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:40,860
- For real...
- We'll give you gold.

1660
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:41,920
Real gold?

1661
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,020
Isn't that chocolate?

1662
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,460
- It's chocolate.
- Come on.

1663
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,760
Give me one more of that.

1664
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,060
If you can collect
60 pieces of gold,

1665
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,500
you all can sleep indoors.

1666
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,070
It's a group thing.

1667
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,200
Every time you lack
ten pieces of gold,

1668
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,070
one of you has to sleep outdoors.

1669
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:59,510
So 1 of you has to sleep outdoors
even if you collect 59 pieces.

1670
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:00,680
- Okay.
- That's the rule.

1671
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,910
That doesn't sound easy.

1672
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:04,410
You'll be on your first expedition.

1673
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,850
You're visiting different places
in two groups.

1674
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:07,850
You mean, groups of three?

1675
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:09,750
Se Yoon, Joon, and DinDin
are in one team.

1676
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,650
Jong Min, Sae Ho, and Seon Ho
are in one team.

1677
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,450
You will now go...

1678
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,460
- and find treasures of Jeju.
- Okay.

1679
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,860
- All right.
- Let's go.

1680
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:17,860
See you later.

1681
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,490
- See you.
- Let's go.

1682
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,500
Jong Min,
give me back the gold pieces.

1683
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,600
Three pieces. Who is it?

1684
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:27,200
Is it chocolate?

1685
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:28,740
Yes, it is.

1686
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,940
(They're off to find treasure
after returning the gold pieces.)

1687
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,470
What? Are we getting
on an off-road vehicle?

1688
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,740
(For 2 Days and 1 Night explorers)

1689
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,850
(A special gift from the staff)

1690
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,150
I want to drive this car.

1691
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,020
I know. I didn't know
they would get us this car.

1692
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,480
I want to drive this.

1693
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,020
I'm sure we'll get to drive.

1694
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,860
(The off-road vehicles make them
want to explore right away.)

1695
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:48,960
Gosh, it's so high.

1696
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,890
- Great.
- Nice.

1697
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:53,900
(The car is so nice.)

1698
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,000
Nice.

1699
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,700
Does this mean we're going off-road
with this vehicle?

1700
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,700
I guess.

1701
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,440
- I'm sure it's fun to drive this.
- I know.

1702
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,970
All right, let's get going.

1703
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:07,710
- Okay, let's go.
- Off we go to find treasures...

1704
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,340
(Team Se Yoon is off
to find treasures.)

1705
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,180
(Team Se Yoon is determined
to find treasures.)

1706
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,120
Tell them that we'll be back
after finding treasures.

1707
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,550
- Thank you.
- We'll be back with treasures!

1708
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:19,350
(Please find a lot of treasures.)

1709
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,120
(Off to find treasures
with the crowd's cheer)

1710
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,190
Let's go.

1711
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,800
When was the last time
I visited Jeju Island?

1712
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,870
I was here the year before last
to film a drama series.

1713
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:32,170
I was here for 1.5 months.

1714
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,070
- Really? Which one?
- Here?

1715
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:35,400
I filmed "The Escape of the Seven."

1716
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:39,670
We were filming
at these incredible sites.

1717
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:43,210
A bat actually slapped me.

1718
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,210
- A bat?
- Yes, a bat.

1719
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:48,280
We were filming the series in a cave
for 12 hours.

1720
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,920
Something flew at me. It was a bat.

1721
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,320
I was flustered.

1722
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:54,390
It was flying right next to me
as it slapped my face.

1723
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,190
It slapped me with its wing.

1724
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:59,030
I saw many weird creatures
here on Jeju Island.

1725
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,160
(How can a bat slap you?)

1726
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,000
(Soon)

1727
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,870
(That story just happened
to be real.)

1728
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:07,640
(They're in panic.)

1729
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,340
(They really slap you.)

1730
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:14,380
(What will happen to them?)

1731
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:16,180
I came here for a shoot,

1732
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,150
and I came here
with my wife and children.

1733
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,880
- On a trip?
- Yes. I like the Jeju vibe.

1734
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,150
I really like it too.
It feels really great.

1735
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:25,720
(The city that feels nice, Jeju)

1736
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:29,920
I really like
the unstable weather of Jeju.

1737
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:33,130
- The island weather.
- The weather is unpredictable.

1738
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,200
In summer.

1739
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,030
- That's right.
- I love it.

1740
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,200
It's therapeutic
even if you stay still.

1741
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,200
Right.
(It's nice when it's cloudy,)

1742
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:46,210
(and it's nice when it's clear.)

1743
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:48,210
You feel at ease here.

1744
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,940
That's right.

1745
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,450
There are no tall buildings as well.

1746
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,650
(Jeju presents a peaceful heart
to everyone through each charm.)

1747
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,020
It's so beautiful. Look to the left.

1748
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,920
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

1749
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,520
- The stone walls...
- When I come to Jeju,

1750
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,260
I don't really like driving,

1751
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,460
but when I come here,
I feel like driving.

1752
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,260
- That's right.
- You rent a car.

1753
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,060
- The view here is great too.
- It is.

1754
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,630
Personally,

1755
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:12,730
I came here when I was 19 or 20.

1756
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,900
- I think I was 20.
- That's a bit late.

1757
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,940
I came late.

1758
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,170
I came here to film...

1759
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:18,440
the music video for Uhm Jung Hwa.

1760
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,510
I see.

1761
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:22,580
It was called "Festival."
She filmed the music video here.

1762
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:26,250
There was a song called "Emergency"
in KOYOTE's sixth album.

1763
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,220
- "Emergency."
- We filmed...

1764
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:30,220
the music video of that song
here in Jeju.

1765
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,350
I see.

1766
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,420
Many music videos were filmed here.

1767
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,290
- It's pretty.
- It is.

1768
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,760
But where are we going?

1769
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:39,490
I'm just following the GPS system.

1770
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:40,560
(No one knows.)

1771
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,030
I don't know where we are going.

1772
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,370
- A treasure island?
- Wouldn't it be somewhere...

1773
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:45,530
with treasure?

1774
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:46,900
What's your...

1775
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:48,900
number one treasure?

1776
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:50,970
(Number 1 treasure...)

1777
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:53,010
- Sae Ho can say it first.
- I think mine is my family.

1778
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:54,340
- Family.
- Family.

1779
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:55,810
Exclude family. What about objects?

1780
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:58,180
- Objects?
- What do I have?

1781
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,750
- Objects?
- Yes.

1782
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,880
It's just an object.
I won't add any meaning to it.

1783
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,550
My bag.

1784
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,420
- What bag?
- My bag.

1785
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:11,130
- That's nice.
- I'm serious.

1786
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:12,760
- That's possible.
- Yes.

1787
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,030
Is there a particular reason?

1788
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,730
Not really.
I just worked so hard for it.

1789
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:19,230
I saved up little by little
to buy that bag.

1790
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,070
- What about you?
- Treasure?

1791
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,970
These days, it's my ring.

1792
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,970
- Ring? Come on.
- Really? Your wedding ring?

1793
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,940
I should have said that.

1794
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,410
- You said it was your bag.
- It's my ring.

1795
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,080
The hard-earned bag.

1796
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,920
What are Jeju's treasures?

1797
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:36,850
It's very windy because it's Jeju...

1798
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,790
and the sky isn't that clear.

1799
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:42,220
Since we are a team,

1800
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,030
let's check our fortune.

1801
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:47,030
I'll check our fortune for today.

1802
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,660
I'll go first.

1803
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,260
"Someone you haven’t contacted
in a while..."

1804
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,230
"or someone you met
during your travels will become..."

1805
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:55,100
"a reliable companion
on your path ahead."

1806
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,640
You came to travel today.

1807
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,710
This is nice.

1808
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,210
(Joon's fortune
is compatible with today's trip.)

1809
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,240
- What Chinese zodiac sign are you?
- The fat sign.

1810
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:04,680
- I was born in the year of the dog.
- Dog?

1811
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,710
Dog of 1982.

1812
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,220
- Dog of 1982.
- Yes.

1813
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:08,980
Hold on.

1814
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,320
- Dog of 1982?
- Yes.

1815
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:13,490
- What is it?
- "You must be extra cautious..."

1816
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:14,760
"not to get into traffic accidents."

1817
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,720
- What?
- Really?

1818
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,760
(Se Yoon, today's driver,
gets such a fortune.)

1819
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,290
Hold on. I must be cautious
to avoid traffic accidents?

1820
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,760
"Make sure you keep
a safe following distance..."

1821
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,830
- Really?
- No way.

1822
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:23,930
"and carefully observe
the road conditions."

1823
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:25,600
Stop lying. Is that true?

1824
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:28,170
- I'm serious.
- Really?

1825
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,810
This is an off-road trail.

1826
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:33,870
- We're entering a jungle now.
- Can the car go through this?

1827
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:36,580
- Good. This is fun.
- You really have to be careful.

1828
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:38,750
(An off-road trail appears
all of a sudden.)

1829
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,410
- This is fun.
- Really?

1830
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,450
- You really have to be careful.
- Okay.

1831
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:45,590
The car is also an off-road car.

1832
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:46,590
Right.

1833
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:49,160
- We really should be careful.
- I've never caused any accidents.

1834
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,990
Don't worry about that.

1835
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:52,930
Where are we going
that we're going in like this?

1836
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,830
- This is fun.
- Where is this?

1837
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:57,030
This is like "Indiana Jones."

1838
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,230
It's like "Indiana Jones."

1839
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:00,470
Nice. "Adventures of Sinbad."

1840
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:01,700
(2 Days and 1 Night Jones:
In Search of Jeju's Treasures)

1841
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:02,900
Nice!

1842
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,710
Nice. Let's go find the treasure.

1843
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,680
I will turn my life around.

1844
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,410
- But the road...
- This...

1845
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:13,410
This location is like
the hidden treasure of Jeju.

1846
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:16,680
- What is this? I'm excited.
- I'm so excited about this.

1847
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,750
- This is so fun.
- How could there be such a road?

1848
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,920
Is this the place? We're here.

1849
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,020
(They finally reached
the unknown place.)

1850
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:26,360
(What adventure awaits the members?)

1851
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,130
(The 3 of them reach the destination
after passing the off-road trail)

1852
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:32,730
(The thick oreum of Jeju)

1853
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:34,500
Let's go find the treasure.

1854
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,140
What?

1855
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,640
It's nearby. Nice.

1856
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,040
(They find
the production crew nearby.)

1857
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,880
- Amazing.
- I thought we had to keep climbing.

1858
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,140
I was worried.

1859
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,550
They're nearby, but their clothes...

1860
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:46,810
I guess the treasure is here.

1861
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:50,050
Why are the cameramen dressed...

1862
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,090
Why are you dressed like that?

1863
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,890
- Is this a game?
- Are we going to "Squid Game?"

1864
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,520
You are now...

1865
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:57,930
about to head toward
the path of fire...

1866
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:01,100
where lava once flowed
10,000 years ago.

1867
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,730
It's hot.

1868
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:05,530
This place where you are about
to go on a special expedition...

1869
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:07,740
(The special expedition site is
hidden in the magnificent forest.)

1870
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:10,170
- is the Bengdui Cave.
- A cave?

1871
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,070
- A cave?
- There is a cave here?

1872
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:13,110
Right.

1873
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,710
There are bats inside.

1874
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,510
It is one
of the lava caves listed...

1875
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,180
as a UNESCO
World Natural Heritage site.

1876
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:23,520
(The Bengdui Cave is one of them.)

1877
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:28,520
This cave is normally
not open to the public...

1878
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,220
so that it remains preserved.

1879
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,860
Every year, it is opened
only during special periods.

1880
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:36,430
Today, as a special occasion
for viewers of 2 Days and 1 Night,

1881
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,100
the Cultural Heritage Service...

1882
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,800
and Jeju Island have granted us
permission to enter the cave.

1883
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,500
Awesome. Just us?

1884
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,800
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1885
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,970
So please introduce it well
to the viewers.

1886
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,540
We will now get changed
and enter the cave.

1887
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,880
- For safety?
- Get changed?

1888
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,750
- Let's get changed.
- I'll do that. Here.

1889
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:53,850
(They get changed.)

1890
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,420
Let's go, comrades.

1891
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,250
Let's go find the treasure.

1892
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,720
(They get fully prepared
and head out.)

1893
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,890
Bengdui Cave.

1894
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:04,020
- It's a great honor.
- Right.

1895
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,830
We wouldn't have been able
to go if we had competed for it.

1896
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:07,090
We'll get going...

1897
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,330
since we have to introduce it
to you.

1898
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:13,470
(They nervously enter
the unknown area.)

1899
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,370
This place is awesome.

1900
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:18,140
- Amazing.
- What is this?

1901
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,710
- It's amazing.
- Look at the colors of the trees.

1902
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,340
What is this?

1903
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,450
This is amazing.

1904
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:28,150
Look at this.
The trees are really tall.

1905
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,450
This is Mother Nature.

1906
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:32,650
- The trees...
- It's really...

1907
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,160
(It's full of Japanese cedar trees
that grow up to 40m.)

1908
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,960
What is this green color?

1909
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,530
Goodness. What is this?

1910
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:40,860
Look at the ground.

1911
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:43,800
If Jong Min saw this,
he would have said,

1912
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,130
"They're brackens!"

1913
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,200
(Beech fern)

1914
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,370
(There are various wetland plants.)

1915
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:49,270
(Longleaf falsenettle)

1916
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,740
It really is like "Squid Game"
since we are dressed like this.

1917
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:56,040
You will now enter Bengdui Cave.

1918
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,380
We're really going to a cave.

1919
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,010
(But they can't find Bengdui Cave
where the treasure is.)

1920
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,280
Will we find a cave...

1921
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,380
at the end of this path?

1922
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:04,250
- Let's go.
- How is there a cave here?

1923
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,320
It's an unlikely place
to find a cave.

1924
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,750
It looks like
there won't be any cave around.

1925
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,620
My shoes are sinking deep
into the ground.

1926
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,220
Wait. This...

1927
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,290
What is this? Is this mud?

1928
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:14,230
- Right. It's weird.
- My feet keep sinking.

1929
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:15,500
What is this?

1930
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,760
It feels weird.

1931
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:18,470
Did they deceive us?

1932
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:20,070
Hold on.

1933
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:22,940
(His shoe came off.)

1934
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:24,670
My shoe almost came off.

1935
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,340
They deceived us.

1936
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:30,580
What do you call that place
where you sink?

1937
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,910
- The mudflat.
- The mudflat.

1938
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,480
This is the curse
of the black mudflat.

1939
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,620
(He just says
whatever comes to his mind.)

1940
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:38,520
(They keep walking.)

1941
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,760
I think something might appear.

1942
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,530
- It looks like it will be open.
- It might be open.

1943
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,630
It's time something appears.
There is light.

1944
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:49,760
This place. What?

1945
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:51,830
- What is this?
- Why is there a container?

1946
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,570
Welcome.

1947
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:55,800
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1948
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,470
This is Expedition Curator
Kim Sang Su...

1949
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:00,110
who will help us
on the special expedition.

1950
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:01,240
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.

1951
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

1952
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,080
- Yes.
- You're holding a whip.

1953
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,480
- That is right.
- Why?

1954
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,350
Like this.

1955
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,850
(He's startled.)

1956
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:11,290
The sound isn't coming out properly.

1957
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:14,120
- This...
- Why...

1958
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,790
- Right.
- Why do you have this?

1959
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:18,190
Didn't you watch the movie?

1960
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:20,130
"Indiana Sang Su" is the parody...

1961
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:21,630
of "Indiana Jones."

1962
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:22,800
("Indiana Sang Su")

1963
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,730
- Jones and Sang Su.
- Yes.

1964
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:27,600
Could you give us
a brief explanation of Bengdui Cave?

1965
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,700
Yes. "Bengdui" means
a wide, open field.

1966
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,470
- Bengdui.
- It's "bengdui" in Jeju dialect.

1967
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:36,340
That means lava flowed
onto flat land.

1968
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,340
(Bengdui Cave was formed
by lava flowing beneath it.)

1969
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:40,450
The length of this cave is 4.5km.

1970
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:42,520
- It's 4.5km.
- Will we be okay?

1971
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,550
(They're slightly worried.)

1972
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,820
I think it's going to be so scary.

1973
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:49,690
(They will explore
the highlight part.)

1974
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,530
We will begin...

1975
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:52,730
- Let's start.
- the exploration.

1976
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,260
- Let's go with Indiana Sang Su.
- Yes.

1977
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:55,330
Let's go.

1978
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:58,030
(They head inside Bengdui Cave
with Indiana Sang Su.)

1979
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:59,630
Why does it look like that?

1980
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:02,570
(The security is tight
in front of the cave.)

1981
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:05,970
We're going through this gate.

1982
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,680
(He's overly immersed.)

1983
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,440
This is a very special place.

1984
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,380
Only a few people
from the production crew...

1985
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:14,080
- can go in.
- Really?

1986
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,120
- Yes.
- So I'll be at the exit.

1987
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,790
- See you.
- Come in.

1988
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:23,720
- Prepare your lanterns.
- I'll turn this on.

1989
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:26,560
(They all turn on their lanterns.)

1990
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,800
We'll go in.

1991
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,560
I wouldn't get stuck, right?

1992
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:31,970
If I get stuck,

1993
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:33,230
leave everything and save me first.

1994
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,200
Just throw away the cameras. Okay?

1995
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,340
That's why you're coming.

1996
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:37,770
It's so refreshing.

1997
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,970
Come slowly.

1998
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:41,810
- Slowly.
- It's slippery here. Be careful.

1999
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:43,240
- Be careful.
- Be careful of the moss.

2000
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,710
(They enter the cave
that's like an underground bunker.)

2001
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:48,480
It's like there will be ghosts.

2002
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,680
(It's an amazing space.)

2003
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,420
- It's refreshing.
- It's sharp.

2004
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,620
As you can see,

2005
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,590
the cave connects this way as well.

2006
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:59,630
That's right.

2007
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,560
Since Bengdui Cave...

2008
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,300
stretches along a flat land,

2009
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:07,400
even when small obstacles were met,
the lava split them up.

2010
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,670
- Right.
- The lava...

2011
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,270
- moved in and returned.
- I see.

2012
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,310
That is how it became
a great maze of a cave.

2013
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,640
- This was all created by the lava?
- Gosh.

2014
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,410
It must be really scary
to come here alone.

2015
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,580
This is amazing.

2016
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,550
In case a bad situation occurs,

2017
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,320
this line was installed
for safety measures.

2018
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,790
- You see this, right?
- The blue line. Right.

2019
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,190
We'll move in this way.

2020
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:31,560
I've never been inside a real cave.

2021
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,330
- It's really fascinating.
- Right.

2022
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,860
- Gosh, it goes in that way too.
- Gosh.

2023
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,830
(Different paths can be seen.)

2024
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,670
This is crazy.

2025
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:43,440
- All right. Look carefully here.
- Right.

2026
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:45,070
- Gosh, what is this?
- What is this?

2027
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,070
This is a cave coral.

2028
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:48,610
When met with air,

2029
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:50,280
these things are formed.

2030
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,010
- I see.
- How old is this?

2031
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:55,250
It takes around 100 years
for it to grow around 1cm.

2032
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,920
- Around 100 years?
- That's around how long it takes.

2033
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,390
Then how old is this?

2034
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:00,250
Right. It is expected...

2035
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,960
to have gone through
a long period of time.

2036
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:04,860
It looks so fascinating.

2037
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:05,890
(This was filmed
with an expert's permission.)

2038
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:07,590
I want to take this home.
I can't do that, can I?

2039
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,030
He will go to prison if he does,
right?

2040
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,560
That can never happen.

2041
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:12,730
This looks fascinating.

2042
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:14,070
(A strange product formed by nature)

2043
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,340
- Gosh, the path is narrow.
- Come in this way.

2044
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:20,910
Gosh, it's so low.

2045
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:24,140
Gosh! What is this?

2046
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:26,010
Take a look.

2047
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:28,580
This is a cave and so is this.

2048
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:29,980
This one is a cave too.

2049
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,550
This is one path,
and this is another.

2050
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:33,720
- These are all paths.
- Right.

2051
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,720
There are three paths.

2052
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,290
This is the Nostril Rock.

2053
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:37,960
(It's known as the Nostril Rock
as there are two holes together.)

2054
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,090
This part was formed
because of the lava.

2055
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:42,930
It looks just like a tongue.

2056
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:44,800
You will be able to see it
from up here.

2057
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,800
(A geological structure formed
like a tongue due to the lava)

2058
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,700
We will go in this way...

2059
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,110
and come out the other way.

2060
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:52,240
- Really?
- Gosh.

2061
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,640
Go in yourselves.

2062
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:55,810
Sorry? Just us?

2063
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,610
This one will feel a bit scary.

2064
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:02,020
Gosh, nothing can be seen
without the lights.

2065
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,550
This will feel really scary.

2066
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:04,920
Here I go.

2067
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,190
- Be careful.
- Gosh.

2068
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:12,490
(Dark)

2069
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,330
- Gosh.
- Gosh, this is a bit scary.

2070
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:16,330
(Flustered by the darkness)

2071
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:18,970
(DinDin and Se Yoon
enter behind him.)

2072
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:20,030
Gosh!

2073
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,300
(He lets out a shout out of fear.)

2074
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,970
- What is this?
- It's getting narrower.

2075
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,040
It's so narrow.

2076
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,810
What did he tell us to do
to come out?

2077
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:27,540
Hey, it's too narrow!

2078
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:28,980
Should we turn back?

2079
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,410
We can't turn back.

2080
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,680
- Should we move in farther?
- Move in farther.

2081
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:34,150
- Move in farther?
- Yes.

2082
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:35,350
- Gosh!
- This is amazing.

2083
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,020
Be careful.

2084
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:40,050
(Panting)

2085
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,320
(Panting)

2086
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,960
Hold on. It's blocked here.

2087
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,190
Gosh.

2088
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:48,100
Gosh, hold on.
It's completely blocked.

2089
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,700
(Dead end)

2090
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,960
It's there a path here?

2091
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,930
(Dead end)

2092
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:54,770
- Gosh.
- Gosh, it's a maze.

2093
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:55,970
We can't get out.

2094
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:58,340
(Will they be trapped
in the Bengdui Cave like this?)

2095
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,740
- Jong Min.
- I'm excited to see what's there.

2096
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,840
We're the first ones...

2097
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,210
to go in as ordinary people
in our country.

2098
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:06,980
Was this place never opened?

2099
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,780
No one must have witnessed
this place.

2100
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:11,350
- It's called Gimnyeong Cave.
- Gimnyeong Cave?

2101
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:12,850
We must be going inside a cave.
This is awesome.

2102
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,450
Are you serious?

2103
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,120
This place was designated as...

2104
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,790
a UNESCO World Natural Heritage
in 2007.

2105
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:19,390
It's Gimnyeong Cave.

2106
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:21,060
- Gimnyeong Cave.
- Gimnyeong Cave.

2107
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,500
For the preservation of the cave,

2108
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,100
this place was kept hidden.

2109
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,900
But the Korea Heritage Service
and Jeju Island...

2110
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:29,500
revealed this area
just for 2 Days and 1 Night viewers.

2111
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,700
Gosh, thank you.

2112
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,040
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2113
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,010
- That decision...
- As the one who will lead us,

2114
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:35,840
we will welcome
Researcher Ki Jin Seok.

2115
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,280
- It's great to meet you.
- Hello.

2116
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,880
- He's dressed a bit like us.
- Gosh.

2117
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,550
I'm the curator who will lead you
through the cave expedition.

2118
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:43,020
- You're a curator?
- Right.

2119
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,720
Please open the gate.

2120
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:48,790
It feels cool already.

2121
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:49,790
(They head inside
with excited hearts.)

2122
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:51,460
It feels quite chilly.

2123
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:53,030
I'm serious.

2124
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:54,600
(The cave wind can be felt
from the entrance.)

2125
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,630
- It's a jungle here.
- This is amazing.

2126
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:58,200
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2127
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:01,300
(Surprised)

2128
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,240
As I heard you were coming,
I turned on the air conditioner.

2129
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:05,870
This is a natural wind.

2130
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,610
(It's the grand entrance.)

2131
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:10,180
What is going on?
It's this cool here?

2132
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,850
- Gosh.
- This place feels like a movie set.

2133
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:14,820
Gosh!

2134
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:16,350
Gosh! What is this place?

2135
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,690
- Gosh, look at these steps.
- Right.

2136
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:19,890
You can feel that this place is old.

2137
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,160
- There's water dripping, sir.
- Right.

2138
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:26,230
How long is this place, sir?

2139
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,960
It's around 700m in total.

2140
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,530
- Around 700m?
- It isn't that long.

2141
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:30,560
It isn't that long.

2142
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:33,000
There's a legend that
a large snake lived here.

2143
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,800
That was why it was also called
the Snake Cave.

2144
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,670
- The Snake Cave?
- Right.

2145
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,410
- I have a question.
- Okay.

2146
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:42,910
Was this really formed
just by the lava? Or...

2147
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:45,250
There was no interference by man.
It was naturally formed.

2148
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,450
- It was naturally formed?
- Yes.

2149
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:50,720
The lava was around 800 to 1,200°C.

2150
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,120
It kept melting the ground
as it was hot.

2151
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:55,790
The cave wasn't formed this deep
right away.

2152
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:57,590
- It happened over time.
- The ground kept melting,

2153
01:15:57,590 --> 01:16:00,560
and the ceiling was formed
as the top part hardened first.

2154
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:02,460
A path was formed...

2155
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,860
and the lava kept flowing.

2156
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,000
From the oreum in Deokcheon-ri,

2157
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,100
the lava gushed out.

2158
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:09,270
It flowed out for around 14km
to Woljeong-ri while forming caves.

2159
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:11,170
Isn't this a lava rock?

2160
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:13,510
- Basalt.
- This is basalt.

2161
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:15,180
- It's basalt.
- Basalt.

2162
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,780
It's my first time
seeing sand in a cave like this,

2163
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,780
- Right.
- and I've seen many other caves.

2164
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:22,080
- I mentioned limestone earlier.
- Right.

2165
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,520
This is lime.

2166
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,550
- I see.
- I see.

2167
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,350
This is a lava tube,

2168
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:27,390
but this cave also has...

2169
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:28,460
the characteristics
of a limestone cave.

2170
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,220
It was designated as
a UNESCO World Natural Heritage...

2171
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:31,790
after its worth was acknowledged.

2172
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:33,230
I see.

2173
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:36,060
The wonders of nature are just...

2174
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,830
When else will we get a chance
to visit a place like this?

2175
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,800
If you look here,
you will spot bat stools.

2176
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,400
- What?
- I see.

2177
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,270
- There are bats here?
- Yes. There are bats here.

2178
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:46,910
- There's a lot more than expected.
- These are their stools.

2179
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:49,280
- There's a lot.
- This must be their restroom.

2180
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,210
If we turn off our lights
all at once,

2181
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:52,280
it will be intense.

2182
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,680
Should we try turning them off?
I'm curious.

2183
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,620
- Let's give it a try.
- Let's give it a try. I'm curious.

2184
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,450
- We'll turn off our headlamps.
- Where is it?

2185
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:58,790
One, two, three.

2186
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:00,990
(Pitch black)

2187
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:02,590
Check this out.

2188
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,490
- Nothing can be seen.
- Right.

2189
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:06,790
My gosh!

2190
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:08,160
(Turning the lights back on
out of fear)

2191
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,430
The path is winding like a snake.

2192
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:12,130
Right. This is why it got that name.

2193
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:13,930
It feels nice as it's so cool here.

2194
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:15,840
It's grand.

2195
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,510
It feels like entering a coal mine.

2196
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:19,940
The sand...

2197
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,940
- is disappearing.
- It's disappearing, isn't it?

2198
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,280
It will slowly disappear.

2199
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,910
- As we're deep inside.
- Right.

2200
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:26,580
This is amazing.

2201
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:28,050
- Gosh.
- I've never been...

2202
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:29,080
in a cave like this.

2203
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,080
Right.

2204
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,320
You can see that it's blocked there,

2205
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,350
- right?
- Yes.

2206
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:33,920
That is a lava waterfall.

2207
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,720
- It isn't that big, though.
- A lava waterfall?

2208
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,320
The lava that flowed from the top...

2209
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,390
flowed downward,

2210
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:40,860
and it hardened just like that.

2211
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,860
- Can we go up that way?
- We can.

2212
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,200
Let's go up.

2213
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:45,370
Be careful.

2214
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:47,870
The other team
went to a different cave, right?

2215
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:49,170
- Yes.
- That place is full of slopes.

2216
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:51,140
- Is it narrow there?
- The paths are narrow.

2217
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:53,170
What a relief.
They have to crawl up?

2218
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:54,980
This place is a suite room
compared to that place.

2219
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:57,180
- What a relief.
- What a relief.

2220
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:00,310
They must feel really scared.

2221
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,780
The path is narrowing.

2222
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:02,880
I'm fine.

2223
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,320
- Gosh, what are these?
- What are these?

2224
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,420
These are called lava stalactites.

2225
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:08,960
- What are they?
- Stalactites?

2226
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,160
The lava dripped down
due to gravity...

2227
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,390
- It hardened just like that.
- and hardened just like that.

2228
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,230
- Right. I read about this.
- Right.

2229
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:15,400
It feels like we're inside
the belly of a whale.

2230
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,100
- Right.
- Right.

2231
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,870
- This is the end.
- We've reached the end.

2232
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:22,840
We've managed to reach
the end of Gimnyeong Cave.

2233
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:25,470
- It's fascinating how it's blocked.
- Right.

2234
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:29,280
(A precious experience
that cannot be bought with money)

2235
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,240
Are you done looking around?

2236
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,180
- Yes.
- Let's head back.

2237
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:34,650
I'm just left in awe.

2238
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:36,550
(They head back with light steps.)

2239
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:38,350
It's a World Natural Heritage.

2240
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,890
- Please stand in a line here.
- We must be doing something now.

2241
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,120
It must be our mission.

2242
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:45,660
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

2243
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,730
- We had a great time, sir.
- Right.

2244
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:48,860
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

2245
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,500
- Won't it be around 10m?
- Right.

2246
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,470
(What awaits them?)

2247
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:53,930
Did you enjoy your time here?

2248
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:55,240
- It was amazing.
- I had a great time.

2249
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,810
It felt even more exciting as it was
something that was never seen.

2250
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,270
Then right here,

2251
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:01,410
- What?
- What?

2252
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:04,640
the first mission for the gold coins
will begin.

2253
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,050
What is it?

2254
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:08,450
The mission in Gimnyeong Cave...

2255
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,680
is called Blackout Motion Capture.

2256
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:13,690
Just like how we turned off
our lights earlier?

2257
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:15,020
- You turned off your lights, right?
- Yes.

2258
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,160
- Keep your eyes closed.
- Nothing could be seen.

2259
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,230
We have to get used to the darkness.

2260
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:19,260
Really?

2261
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:21,660
What do we have to do?

2262
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:24,400
While the lights are out, you must touch
the person in front of you...

2263
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,170
to figure out their pose...

2264
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:28,340
and strike the same pose.

2265
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:31,100
(We have to touch each other?)

2266
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,710
You have a time limit of 30 seconds.

2267
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:34,040
You all will succeed
when the three of you...

2268
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,980
are striking the same pose
when the lights are turned on.

2269
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,180
There are a total of ten attempts.

2270
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,880
You will get two gold coins
every time you succeed.

2271
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,050
That's a total of 20 gold coins.

2272
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:44,480
- Right.
- That's a total of 20 gold coins.

2273
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,190
- That's amazing.
- I think we can do this.

2274
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,350
Do you want to go last, Seon Ho?

2275
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:48,890
- I'll make sure to touch well.
- Are you confident?

2276
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:51,160
Can you touch us and get it right?

2277
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,830
- Let's begin.
- Let me straighten my clothes.

2278
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,030
Can I touch you boldly?

2279
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:58,270
You shouldn't be slow.
Touch my whole body right away.

2280
01:19:58,270 --> 01:20:00,730
- If I touch the wrong part...
- Okay.

2281
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:02,700
- You two should turn around.
- Don't think.

2282
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,200
- Just touch me and copy my pose.
- Okay.

2283
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,210
It's easy.

2284
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,410
Let's begin.

2285
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:08,610
Show him the pose.

2286
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:12,580
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

2287
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:14,750
(A somewhat provocative pose)

2288
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:16,950
(Right before the blackout)

2289
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:18,320
- We shouldn't talk?
- Two.

2290
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,820
- Earlier.
- One. Blackout.

2291
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,290
Jong Min, touch me.

2292
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:23,260
Where are you? Okay.

2293
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:25,460
- Okay. I got it.
- The lower body too.

2294
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,860
- Okay. I got it.
- Okay.

2295
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:29,230
Let's go. Seon Ho.

2296
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:31,300
- Where are you?
- I'm here. Okay.

2297
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,930
- It's easy, right?
- I'll look straight ahead.

2298
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:34,830
- Is your hand here? Okay.
- Yes. In the back.

2299
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,740
- All right.
- Five, four,

2300
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:39,510
three, two, one.

2301
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:40,570
Lights on.

2302
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:43,880
- Okay.
- Okay.

2303
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,910
(Perfect)

2304
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:48,850
- Correct.
- Okay. Well done.

2305
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:50,980
- It was...
- Jong Min is really fast.

2306
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,490
- Really?
- Of course.

2307
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,160
(He goes straight to Sae Ho
as soon as the light is turned off.)

2308
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,820
(Touching)

2309
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,190
Okay. I got it.

2310
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,760
Okay.

2311
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,500
(Jong Min didn't see the pose
but copied it successfully.)

2312
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:06,900
(Seon Ho also touched Jong Min.)

2313
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:10,440
(They easily earned 2 gold coins.)

2314
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,840
- Here's the second question.
- I know the pose.

2315
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,210
We should do well.

2316
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:16,080
- Nine, eight...
- You did well, Seon Ho.

2317
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,410
Okay. Thank you, Jong Min.

2318
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:20,510
(He strikes the pose
with difficulty.)

2319
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:22,750
(Blackout)

2320
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,550
- This is hard.
- Is it hard?

2321
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:25,590
I see.

2322
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:28,520
Three, two, one.

2323
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,660
- Turn the light on.
- My gosh.

2324
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,560
- This is it.
- No.

2325
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,130
Hey, what are you doing, Seon Ho?

2326
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:36,260
(Jong Min was touching well.)

2327
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,000
- Come, Seon Ho.
- Where are you?

2328
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,230
- I'm here.
- What?

2329
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:41,570
- You should face me.
- Shall I?

2330
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,300
What is this?

2331
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,400
(Unlike Sae Ho,
Jong Min stretches his arms.)

2332
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,470
Go ahead and touch it.

2333
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:46,540
I did this.

2334
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,040
- What?
- I did this.

2335
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,240
- You did?
- Yes.

2336
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:51,510
- I did this.
- Oh, no.

2337
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:52,850
So I did the same thing.

2338
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,010
Really?

2339
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:55,550
Let's continue.

2340
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:57,020
Show him the pose.

2341
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:59,390
Five, four...

2342
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:02,390
(Shocked)

2343
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:03,860
(What is the pose for Round 3?)

2344
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:04,990
- Here.
- What's this?

2345
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:05,990
(Laughing)

2346
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:07,760
- What's this?
- Is it at the bottom?

2347
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,330
I can't see.

2348
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:10,400
- Here.
- What's this?

2349
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,230
- What's this?
- Is it at the bottom?

2350
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,440
- Is it at the bottom? What?
- Okay? Okay.

2351
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,570
Is it up or down?

2352
01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:18,000
- Is it up or down?
- I can't see.

2353
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,240
Of course, you can't.

2354
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:22,210
- Okay.
- What's with your fingers?

2355
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,980
What are you doing
with your fingers?

2356
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,950
You have ten seconds left.

2357
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:27,550
- You're doing it again.
- Okay.

2358
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:28,580
What should I do?

2359
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:29,920
It's done.

2360
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,890
- Five, four...
- Done? You came too late.

2361
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:33,950
- What? What's this?
- Touch my hand.

2362
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:38,060
(Will Seon Ho be able to copy it
within 3 seconds?)

2363
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:40,960
- Okay.
- One. Turn the light on.

2364
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,730
(Surprising)

2365
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:44,060
- What did you do?
- We did it.

2366
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,130
- I think we got it right.
- It's done.

2367
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:46,330
(Seon Ho copied it perfectly
only in 3 seconds.)

2368
01:22:46,330 --> 01:22:47,370
Success!

2369
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,740
Seon Ho. You did it in five seconds.

2370
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:53,010
Hey, he did it only in five seconds.

2371
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:54,840
I just imagined it.

2372
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,640
- My gosh.
- I touched his bottom,

2373
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,950
- so I was like, "Bottom?"
- With only five seconds left.

2374
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:00,150
(Even after that...)

2375
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:01,850
(They succeeded in Round 4.)

2376
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:04,420
(They succeeded in Round 5.)

2377
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:05,990
(They even succeeded in Round 6.)

2378
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,120
- Success!
- Yes!

2379
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,120
(They earned 10 gold coins
in an instant.)

2380
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,020
- My goodness.
- Seon Ho is good at this.

2381
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:11,760
- We're doing well.
- Okay.

2382
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,030
We missed only one question.

2383
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,890
- Let's go.
- All right. Turn around.

2384
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:16,030
We will change the order.

2385
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:17,400
- Come on.
- Why?

2386
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,830
- Why would you do that?
- We planned it in the first place.

2387
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:20,830
- Really?
- Gosh.

2388
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,100
It's because we're doing so well.

2389
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:23,370
- Jong Min.
- Okay.

2390
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:24,500
We're too good.

2391
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,310
- Let's change the order for them.
- How?

2392
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,410
Seon Ho, do you want to go first?

2393
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,680
- You go 1st.
- Should I go 1st?

2394
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,110
Yes. I'll go second,
and Jong Min will go last.

2395
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:31,110
Okay.

2396
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:32,550
Let's continue.

2397
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,710
I bet it will take 0.3...

2398
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,450
Show him the pose.

2399
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,750
- What is this?
- Nine, eight, seven...

2400
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:43,220
Four, three, two, one.

2401
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:45,230
- You should touch my fingers well.
- Blackout.

2402
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:47,630
Where are you?

2403
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,130
What is this?

2404
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:50,860
(Searching without hesitation)

2405
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:51,930
Okay?

2406
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:53,700
- Yes.
- You should hurry.

2407
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:54,830
I should do it too.

2408
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:56,770
- Okay.
- You have ten seconds left.

2409
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:57,840
What?

2410
01:23:58,510 --> 01:23:59,570
Okay.

2411
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:00,570
(It turned into a circle
over his head.)

2412
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:01,980
- Okay.
- Five, four,

2413
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,440
- Will they get it right?
- three,

2414
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,180
two, one.

2415
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:06,410
Turn the light on.

2416
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:11,150
This is it. Isn't this it?

2417
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:12,650
- Wrong.
- Isn't this it?

2418
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:14,350
- Why?
- I was doing this.

2419
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:17,060
You should've done it like this.
Why...

2420
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:18,760
- Why did you do that?
- You told me not to do it.

2421
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,960
- The hands should be like that.
- Stay in the back.

2422
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,000
What are you doing?

2423
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,760
(Laughing)

2424
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,400
Seon Ho will sleep outdoors.

2425
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,400
No.

2426
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:28,470
Here's the eighth question.

2427
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:29,700
- The eighth?
- Yes.

2428
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:30,770
We've done a good job.

2429
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:32,210
Show him the pose.

2430
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:35,910
- I see. Hang on.
- Seven, six...

2431
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:38,980
(The point is to hold the ankle
with one hand.)

2432
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,780
(Confused)

2433
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:41,820
Blackout.

2434
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,620
- I'm here.
- Where?

2435
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,490
- Are you down there?
- Watch my left and right hands.

2436
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:47,250
- Are you at the bottom?
- My left and right hands.

2437
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,690
(Did Jong Min
strike the pose properly?)

2438
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:50,190
- Can you feel it? Okay.
- Yes.

2439
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:53,190
- Three, two, one.
- The hand...

2440
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:55,460
- Just the leg... Done.
- Turn the light on.

2441
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:56,900
What are you doing?

2442
01:24:57,830 --> 01:24:59,170
What are you doing?

2443
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:00,500
Why are you...

2444
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:03,870
(Jong Min struck the pose properly.)

2445
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:04,940
Seon Ho is good.

2446
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:06,470
- We have five seconds left.
- Four,

2447
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:08,040
- three,
- The position of your palm.

2448
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,410
- two...
- Your hand.

2449
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,910
Why are you...

2450
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:12,910
(They failed because of Sae Ho.)

2451
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:15,320
(Embarrassed)

2452
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,350
- You weren't like this earlier.
- I don't understand.

2453
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:18,420
You were like this.

2454
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:20,390
Should we go with the order
we tried first?

2455
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:22,060
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

2456
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,160
(They lost confidence
after failing consecutively.)

2457
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,320
Here's the ninth question.

2458
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,330
- Turn around.
- Then...

2459
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:26,530
Be careful with your hand.

2460
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:28,930
Show him the pose.

2461
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,860
You should copy
the facial expression too.

2462
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:32,070
How would we copy
the facial expression?

2463
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:33,230
How would we know?

2464
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:34,530
(The point is the fatal wink.)

2465
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:36,600
Five, four,

2466
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:37,900
- three,
- Jong Min.

2467
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,670
- two, one.
- Yes.

2468
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:41,140
- Blackout.
- Touch my whole face.

2469
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:42,380
- Okay.
- Really?

2470
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,840
- Touch my whole face.
- Hang on.

2471
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,180
Didn't you say it'd be easy?

2472
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,180
Eyes?
How can I know they're your eyes?

2473
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,720
- Lips.
- Lips? What?

2474
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,750
Why lips?

2475
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,620
- Are these your lips?
- Ten seconds left.

2476
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:55,390
Jong Min, you should hurry.

2477
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:57,890
- I'm here.
- You should come.

2478
01:25:57,890 --> 01:25:58,890
(Hurriedly approaching Seon Ho)

2479
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,200
(Super focused)

2480
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:06,270
(A dramatic success
or 3 consecutive failures?)

2481
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:07,330
Turn the light on.

2482
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,900
(Closing both eyes,
Opening both eyes)

2483
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,200
You failed.

2484
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,970
What? Which part is wrong?

2485
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,440
- Which part?
- This is wrong.

2486
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,610
You can't come to me
with only three seconds left.

2487
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:19,710
- This is the last question.
- Okay.

2488
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:20,850
Turn around.

2489
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:22,820
(The last round)

2490
01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:26,520
(The last chance in Gimnyeong Cave)

2491
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,290
I can't see when it's dark.

2492
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:29,460
Right.

2493
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,990
All right. Let's continue.

2494
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,930
Show him the pose.

2495
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:35,500
What is this?

2496
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,100
- Seven, six,
- My gosh, this is crazy.

2497
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,000
- five, four...
- This is...

2498
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,430
- One. Blackout.
- Wait. I couldn't see it.

2499
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:43,700
- I couldn't see it. Hey.
- Where are you?

2500
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:45,810
- Hey.
- Where are you?

2501
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:46,870
- I'm down here.
- Where?

2502
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:48,880
- Are you down?
- Touch me carefully.

2503
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,310
Touch both my hands carefully.

2504
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:54,050
- The right and left hands.
- Okay.

2505
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,520
And the legs.

2506
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:57,050
What are you doing?

2507
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,080
- You should come now.
- Okay.

2508
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:00,720
- You should come now.
- Okay. Go ahead.

2509
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:02,760
(Sae Ho succeeded.)

2510
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,860
- Where are you?
- Ten seconds left.

2511
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:04,860
Down here.

2512
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,860
- What is this?
- Touch both hands carefully.

2513
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:09,230
- And the legs.
- Five, four,

2514
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:10,500
- three,
- Just do it.

2515
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,370
- two, one.
- Don't joke around. Just do it.

2516
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:13,530
- Turn the light on.
- All right.

2517
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:15,440
- Two, one.
- Don't joke around. Just do it.

2518
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:16,700
- Turn the light on.
- All right.

2519
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:18,070
- Okay.
- Okay.

2520
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:19,670
- Is that it?
- Did we succeed?

2521
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:20,770
Is this right?

2522
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:23,110
- Success.
- Seon Ho is good.

2523
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:24,110
(They got their pride back
in the last round.)

2524
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:26,910
- Jong Min was missing at first.
- Right.

2525
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,880
- My gosh.
- I know.

2526
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,220
You did well.

2527
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:31,250
Nice.

2528
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,750
You succeeded in six rounds.

2529
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,950
- So you got 12 gold coins.
- All right.

2530
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:36,820
You can take these.

2531
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:39,690
(Time to receive the prize)

2532
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:41,160
- Ta-da.
- Okay.

2533
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:42,360
Can we eat this?

2534
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,100
If you eat it,
the gold coin is gone.

2535
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,430
We should never
give these to Jong Min.

2536
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:48,430
- We never know what he'll do.
- You should keep them.

2537
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:49,440
I don't like chocolate.

2538
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,770
Now, let's go meet the other team.

2539
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:53,310
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

2540
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,910
It's not so hot today.

2541
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:56,340
That's because we just got out.

2542
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:57,410
Is that it?

2543
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:59,780
(Meanwhile, in Bengdui Cave)

2544
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:02,820
Hang on. This is blocked.

2545
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:04,450
(Dead end)

2546
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:05,750
Is there a way?

2547
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,650
(Dead end)

2548
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:08,790
Yes.

2549
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:11,820
This is a maze. We can't get out.

2550
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:14,460
(Where's the way out?)

2551
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,830
- Gosh, what is this?
- Mind the ground.

2552
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:19,400
I bet it collapsed.

2553
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,570
(It is a total mess
with the maze and rocks.)

2554
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:22,640
Hey, this is the way out.

2555
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:24,600
(DinDin's camera)

2556
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,010
Gosh, this is amazing.

2557
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:27,010
(They see a light in the distance.)

2558
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,840
We could sleep in a tent here.

2559
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:33,010
Can we sleep here?

2560
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:35,880
This is a real cave.

2561
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:39,420
Gosh, look at that. How is it...

2562
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:40,950
Can you come down?

2563
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:42,260
(It's quite high.)

2564
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:43,520
(It's not easy to get out.)

2565
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,920
I think I can.

2566
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:48,460
(DinDin and Lee Joon
come down carefully.)

2567
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:49,730
I shouldn't step on this?

2568
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:51,500
- Where?
- Like this?

2569
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:53,100
Turn around. Yes.

2570
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,970
(Lastly, it's Se Yoon's turn.)

2571
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,070
- Here?
- Yes.

2572
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:57,270
Put your left foot here.

2573
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:58,810
Don't my bottoms look too big?

2574
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:00,310
- The right foot here.
- Here?

2575
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:02,640
Further down.

2576
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,180
They are huge.

2577
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:06,950
- Can I spank you?
- They're as big as the rock.

2578
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:09,350
- They're really big.
- As big as the rock here.

2579
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:11,320
- Your right foot. Like this.
- My goodness.

2580
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,050
I want to spank you.

2581
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:15,660
I'm so humiliated. I'll teach you
a lesson once I get there.

2582
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:17,660
Then you should go back up.

2583
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,530
- Go back up.
- I'll go down.

2584
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:20,930
- No, go up.
- Why?

2585
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:22,630
- Hurry and go back up.
- Why?

2586
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:24,760
- My gosh.
- Take a photo first.

2587
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:26,870
DinDin, you should be here.

2588
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:27,930
- Here?
- Yes.

2589
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:29,540
- Let's take a photo.
- My goodness.

2590
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:31,770
My gosh. This will be
my family treasure.

2591
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:32,840
Seriously.

2592
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:36,110
(The Bengdui Cave photo zone)

2593
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:39,450
(In front of the Nostril Rock)

2594
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:41,180
Let's go this way.

2595
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:42,950
This is a dead cave.

2596
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:44,650
In a dead cave,

2597
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:46,750
you can see cracks like this.

2598
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:49,220
And water seeps in like this.

2599
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:51,120
(He looks up
at the roof of the cave.)

2600
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,030
- There are bats.
- Oh, no.

2601
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:55,460
(Flapping)

2602
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:56,460
They're so scary.

2603
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:00,630
(Scared)

2604
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:02,400
(Even DinDin's cameraman jumps.)

2605
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,470
What did I tell you? They slap you.

2606
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:05,540
They're so scary.

2607
01:30:05,770 --> 01:30:06,910
- Hey.
- That was a huge surprise.

2608
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:09,340
What did I say? I wasn't lying.

2609
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:10,980
- They can hit you.
- What...

2610
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:13,310
We scared the bats.
They don't scare us.

2611
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:14,610
Yes. Sorry.

2612
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:15,780
Come this way.

2613
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,020
Are those bats old too?

2614
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:20,550
We'll keep going this way.

2615
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:22,520
- Is there more?
- Yes.

2616
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,160
(Next episode)

2617
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:28,090
(It's time for
a special Jeju experience.)

2618
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:29,960
(If you want to live,)

2619
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,830
(run.)

2620
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,870
(Powerful and thrilling...)

2621
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:35,640
(are Jeju's mountains...)

2622
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:37,470
(and sea)

2623
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,010
(Hurry, Se Yoon!)

2624
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:41,410
(Gosh, it's cold.)

2625
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,540
(The rough excursion...)

2626
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:48,410
(and the mysteries at the end.)

2627
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,180
(And then...)

2628
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:55,250
Gosh, this is...

2629
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,090
It's scary.

2630
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:01,090
Where are we...

2631
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:02,560
- What's this?
- What's this?

2632
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,560
Why aren't you getting out?

2633
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:09,300
(The members are in
pitch-black darkness.)

2634
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:12,070
Hello?

2635
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:14,440
(A maze in which
they can't see an inch ahead.)

2636
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:16,780
(Will they manage to get back?)

2637
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:18,510
I'll take it off.
