1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,140
We touched the sky.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,110
(The members reached the next spot.)

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,610
We're at the top.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,110
It's so pretty.

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,650
- How great is this?
- It's crazy.

6
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,750
I love it.

7
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,020
This is Mount Hanwoo in Uiryeong.

8
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,220
- Mount Hanwoo.
- Yes.

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,020
(It means "cold rain"
because the raindrops...)

10
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,330
(were cold even in the summer.)

11
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,660
There's a tale that ogres
live on Mount Hanwoo.

12
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,730
- How scary.
- Yes.

13
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,860
(The famous tale about Soemogi...)

14
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,030
(who loved Lady Eungbong)

15
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,200
That's why they created
the ogre forest.

16
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,270
I see.

17
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,470
The story goes, if you reach...

18
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,840
the end of the trail and touch
the ogre's golden manggaetteok,

19
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,710
you become rich.

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,380
Before the next mission,

21
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,080
let's see if we can get
some of that energy.

22
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,250
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go.

23
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,280
(They're off to get
some good energy.)

24
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,820
It would be so much fun
to paraglide from here.

25
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,120
Go on your own. We're fine.

26
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,950
What? Look at this.

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,190
Sae Ho.

28
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,720
- Soemogi.
- This is Soemogi.

29
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,660
Soemogi looks a bit like Sae Ho.

30
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,230
I can't deny that.

31
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,300
You look alike.

32
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,800
It's a mix of Sae Ho and Se Yoon.

33
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,060
But it has Jong Min's nose.

34
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,500
This is the ogre forest.

35
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,270
- This is it.
- Let's go.

36
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,500
(They enter the ogre forest.)

37
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,540
What's this? It has a killer view.

38
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,670
It's amazing.

39
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,110
- It's an incredible view.
- It's insane.

40
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,450
Look at this.

41
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,580
(It looks like a painting.)

42
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,080
It's so beautiful.

43
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,720
- It's crazy.
- It's well-made.

44
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,850
They made a lovely trail.

45
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,260
This is an actual healing program.

46
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,830
Isn't this beautiful? Look around.

47
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,830
It's awesome.

48
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,400
I want a souvenir.

49
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,730
(He takes a selfie.)

50
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,800
(Satisfied)

51
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,700
That must be the manggaetteok.

52
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,800
That's the manggaetteok.

53
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,370
There's a golden manggaetteok.

54
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,440
This is the place for ogres.

55
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,710
You'll become rich
if you touch the manggaetteok.

56
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,040
(Touch the manggaetteok
and become rich.)

57
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,480
Being rich...
DinDin wants to be rich.

58
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,110
Is he making another wish?

59
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,180
Make my YouTube channel a success.

60
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,820
I just want to beat Sae Ho.

61
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,650
Why am I the target?

62
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,620
- You're the closest one.
- Really?

63
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,820
(Shall I make a wish too?)

64
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,790
It's fun to see this in a mountain.

65
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,830
I want to touch it too.

66
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,560
I wish that Sae Ho...

67
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,700
I wish that Sae Ho
doesn't become financially rich.

68
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,070
I want him to be rich with dandruff.

69
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,440
- Rich with what?
- With dandruff.

70
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,400
- That's your wish?
- What are you saying?

71
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,110
You're crazy.

72
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,710
Gather round for a photo.

73
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,210
One, two, three.

74
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,610
(We hope
everyone's wishes come true.)

75
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,320
We'll take a short break
before we head back.

76
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,480
- We go now?
- Yes.

77
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,090
- It's a manggaetteok.
- Manggaetteok?

78
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,090
I've never had one before.

79
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,260
I really wanted one.

80
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,760
I've always wanted to taste one.

81
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,730
This mission is called...

82
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,160
Who Ate the Manggaetteok?

83
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,700
- Okay.
- In front of you...

84
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,370
are three sets of manggaetteok.

85
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,740
Two sets have wasabi inside.

86
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,640
One set is the tasty,
authentic manggaetteok...

87
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,810
we got from a famous store
in a market in Uiryeong.

88
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,480
The defenders
must put on a perfect act...

89
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,140
to deceive the challengers.

90
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,050
The challengers win
if they identify who ate...

91
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,750
the authentic manggaetteok.

92
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,680
The team
that attacks successfully...

93
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,450
will get ten yeopjeons.

94
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,920
How many do we have right now?

95
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,160
The current count is...

96
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,290
Team Kim Moon Cheol has 117.

97
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,300
Team Ho Joon Ho has 134.

98
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,630
- What?
- There's that big a difference?

99
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,700
The difference is 17.

100
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,000
Do you know why that is?
All you did so far...

101
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,900
was get three from selling books.

102
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
The books did the work, not you.

103
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,000
We'll flip a yeopjeon...

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,140
to decide who goes first.

105
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,940
- Okay.
- Pick a side...

106
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,780
and if your side appears,
take your pick.

107
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,780
- What do you want to do?
- We'll go second.

108
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,780
If the Chinese character appears,
we'll go first.

109
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,150
If the other side appears,

110
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,220
- you go first.
- Sure.

111
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,220
- Okay.
- Okay?

112
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,890
What side means we go first?

113
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,920
- Korean?
- Korean writing.

114
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,960
Chinese characters is us.

115
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,290
- Look.
- It's Chinese.

116
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,290
- Chinese.
- We go first.

117
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,360
- You go first.
- Yes.

118
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,530
Which will you eat?

119
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,960
- This one.
- Then I'll eat this one.

120
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,100
(They pick their manggaetteok.)

121
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,130
They all look the same.

122
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,900
Wait. I can't swap, can I?

123
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,700
I see green sticking out.

124
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,540
- Really?
- That's a trick.

125
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,010
- Are you at it already?
- Come on.

126
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,340
- We'll eat.
- Yes.

127
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,380
Eat one each.

128
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,410
You eat the leaf too, okay?

129
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,780
- The leaf too, right?
- Yes.

130
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,650
- Is the leaf edible?
- Of course it is.

131
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,750
No, don't eat it.

132
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,850
- Will I die on the spot?
- No.

133
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,180
- Don't eat it.
- Just eat it.

134
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,790
Let's get the mission done.

135
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,350
There would be nothing
you can't eat if it were like that.

136
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,720
That will neutralize the taste.

137
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
Okay.

138
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,790
- Eat one each.
- Go on and eat one.

139
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,630
Okay. One, two, three.

140
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,400
Joon's is yellow.

141
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,300
Yellow is the color of mustard.

142
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,770
- They added wasabi.
- He said green.

143
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,970
(Chewing)

144
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,270
They added wasabi.

145
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,480
(He looks like
he's about to spit it out.)

146
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,380
(Screaming)

147
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,080
(Inhaling)

148
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,780
(Two people grimace. Is it an act?)

149
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,850
Hang on.

150
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,490
(Between them is one very calm man.)

151
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,150
The food
in Seon Ho's mouth is white.

152
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,190
I can't swallow this.

153
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,190
(Super calm)
Hang on.

154
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,330
(Observing closely)

155
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,630
Sae Ho. It's 100 percent an act.

156
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,660
(He's overreacting.)

157
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,900
Seon Ho's for real.

158
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,100
(It looks like his contains wasabi.)

159
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,170
- My gosh.
- Seon Ho...

160
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,440
I want Sae Ho and Seon Ho
to swap plates.

161
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,340
Yes, Sae Ho and Seon Ho swap
and not Joon.

162
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,340
Yes.

163
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,040
Chew over 20 times.

164
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,840
You need to watch out.

165
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,610
You really need to be careful.

166
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,110
- My gosh.
- Chew properly.

167
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,450
- Chew it well.
- I barely had anything for lunch.

168
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,480
- Darn it.
- Chew it well.

169
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,680
Don't try to open your mouth.
Just chew it naturally.

170
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,020
It's the right rice cake, isn't it?

171
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
(Once again, he's about to cry.)

172
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,320
Don't open your mouth.

173
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,490
Why do I...

174
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,820
(They still find the rice cake spicy
even after switching them.)

175
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,660
Seon Ho isn't acting. It's for real.

176
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,730
- I've never done this before.
- My gosh.

177
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,230
(On the other hand,
Joon seems calm.)

178
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,370
This is enough. Let's stop here.
Why don't we stop now?

179
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,800
- Come here.
- This is...

180
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,040
- Who do you think it is?
- I think it's Sae Ho.

181
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,370
- Okay. Let's go with Sae Ho.
- Are you ready?

182
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,480
- We've reached our decision.
- We already made it earlier.

183
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,810
I think they saw the color of it.

184
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,350
Then call out the name of the member
whom you think had...

185
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,810
the real manggaetteok.

186
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,850
Seon Ho...

187
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
is not it. It's Sae Ho.

188
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,620
(They single out Sae Ho.)

189
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,750
- All right.
- My gosh.

190
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,090
- You need to check.
- You said it was him.

191
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,830
Gosh, this isn't
the real manggaetteok.

192
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,860
Enjoy it.

193
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,900
I didn't chew it yet.

194
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,730
(He's testing it out
as he pretends to chew it.)

195
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,930
Are you a mosquito?

196
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,640
(He starts frowning slowly.)

197
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,440
(He can't maintain his composure
as if he's eating something awful.)

198
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,950
His rice cake did have wasabi.

199
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,320
- Let me try that.
- I haven't tasted it either.

200
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,490
- You've never tasted it before?
- It was Joon.

201
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,650
- Try it.
- It was Joon.

202
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,020
- It was Joon?
- Yes.

203
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,090
It was me.

204
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,890
(When the two of them tasted
the super spicy rice cakes,)

205
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,730
(Joon faced it head-on
instead of overreacting.)

206
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,300
- Nice!
- Nice!

207
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
- Nice!
- Okay.

208
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,330
- All right.
- That was tough.

209
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,830
You failed to win ten yeopjeons.

210
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,270
You'll switch positions now...

211
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,470
- and play one more round.
- We have to switch.

212
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,970
Which one do you want?

213
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,210
- Hold on.
- Don't look. Just pick one.

214
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,540
I don't want to eat
the wasabi rice cake.

215
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,580
Me neither.

216
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,680
- I want this one.
- They're only looking out...

217
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,750
for themselves.

218
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,080
I want this one.

219
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,020
- I want this one.
- Okay. You come here then.

220
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,380
- Stand in the middle.
- In the middle...

221
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,990
But you can't tell
which one it is...

222
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,390
- just by looking at it.
- We must cover it up.

223
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,420
- Now that I've done it...
- Okay. Should we eat it now?

224
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,660
- Should we eat it now?
- Yes, enjoy.

225
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,260
- Yes. Okay.
- You can't even tell up close.

226
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,990
- Okay. Enjoy.
- You can't even tell by its smell.

227
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,490
(Even they don't know
who has the tasty manggaetteok.)

228
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,530
(Which one of them
is having the tasty manggaetteok?)

229
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,530
(Humming)

230
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,970
(Is he nodding?)

231
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,300
(Jong Min is known
to go over the top.)

232
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,040
(But surprisingly,
he's calmly eating the rice cake.)

233
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,270
Why isn't Jong Min doing his thing?

234
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,710
- Jong Min, do your thing.
- What?

235
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,710
Why isn't he exaggerating it?

236
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,110
It's the tasty manggaetteok.
How can I do that?

237
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,880
(Is he pretending that
his tongue is numb?)

238
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,150
Gosh, I'm full. I can't eat this.

239
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,420
I'm just full. That's all.

240
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Gosh, he's so good.

241
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,790
(DinDin grabs the bucket too.)

242
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,920
Gosh, I'm so full.

243
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,360
(The two of them give up.
Is this all part of their act?)

244
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,060
I think DinDin was trying his best
to keep eating.

245
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,260
- I bet it's 1 of the 2.
- Yes, I agree. I think...

246
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,260
Gosh, this is...

247
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,960
(Acting anxious rather late)

248
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,400
- Don't you think he's overdoing it?
- That's way too over the top.

249
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,370
(Suspecting)

250
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,700
He's overdoing it.

251
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,110
(Confused)

252
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,440
Let me ask you. How did it taste?

253
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,640
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

254
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,610
- It's spicy.
- So it was spicy for you?

255
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,880
It looks like Se Yoon had
the wasabi rice cake.

256
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,280
- Jong Min.
- No, I had the manggaetteok.

257
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,380
(It's so tasty that
it's bringing tears to his eyes.)

258
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,390
- It's so good.
- Is it because it's so good?

259
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,390
My gosh.

260
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,520
I actually think Se Yoon
might've eaten the tasty one.

261
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,020
Can't we ask them to switch?

262
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,590
I think their acting might be
about the same.

263
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,630
- But do what you want.
- Let's try it.

264
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,600
- Go ahead.
- Jong Min. Se Yoon.

265
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,730
- Could you switch your rice cakes?
- Okay.

266
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,230
No!

267
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,730
(Jong Min tastes
Se Yoon's rice cake.)

268
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,800
He ate it.

269
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,910
(Chewing)

270
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,210
(Is he nervous?)

271
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,410
(Se Yoon tastes
Jong Min's rice cake.)

272
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,010
(Munching)

273
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,020
(For now, he pretends
the rice cake is tasty.)

274
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,890
(Anxious)

275
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,990
(After having Se Yoon's rice cake,
he gradually turns into a zombie.)

276
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,130
(Giving his all to his acting
to confuse them)

277
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,330
(Confused)

278
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,430
I saw it.

279
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,870
(On the other hand,
Se Yoon stays calm.)

280
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,470
Se Yoon has the tasty manggaetteok.

281
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,710
(As if!)

282
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,940
(He turns into a zombie too.)

283
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,140
Come here.

284
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,350
(This is tough.)

285
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,750
I think it's Se Yoon's.

286
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,980
Let's trust Seon Ho and go with it.

287
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,180
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

288
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,490
- You won't criticize me?
- No.

289
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,790
- We won't criticize you. Never.
- Okay.

290
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,990
Team Ho Joon Ho.
Call out the name of the member...

291
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,790
whom you think had
the tasty manggaetteok.

292
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,660
Moon Se Yoon!

293
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,260
- No twists? You chose me?
- Yes.

294
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,700
- Will that be your decision?
- Yes.

295
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,870
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

296
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,870
Director Joo is giving you
one more chance.

297
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,570
- No. Just now,
- Suit yourself.

298
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,740
Se Yoon stuttered.

299
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,900
- Suit yourself. Let's end this.
- All right.

300
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,910
He's stuttering.

301
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,710
Okay. I'll reveal the answer.

302
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,080
- Is it DinDin's rice cake?
- All right.

303
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,610
Team Ho Joon Ho.

304
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,810
(If they're right,)

305
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,080
(they can win 10 yeopjeons.)

306
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,380
What is it?

307
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,980
(Did Se Yoon really have
the tasty manggaetteok?)

308
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,220
(Nervous)

309
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,220
You were correct.

310
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,090
(Team Ho Joon Ho's answer
was correct.)

311
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,660
- It was you?
- Yes, it was him.

312
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,590
(Team Kim Moon Cheol's defense
fails.)

313
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,800
Gosh, Seon Ho was spot on
and figured it out.

314
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,870
- My gosh.
- You were great.

315
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,930
The key was knowing
their personality.

316
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,940
- Right.
- You were great.

317
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,940
- You were spot on.
- That was impressive.
How did you know?

318
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,210
- Hey. Seon Ho.
- At first,

319
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,370
Se Yoon started acting.

320
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,140
- You thought I was acting?
- But it looked so fake.

321
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,640
I wasn't acting.

322
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,250
I missed my window.

323
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,110
- It was so tasty.
- I see.

324
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,980
I thought, "I can't believe
I got lucky with this."

325
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,820
So I missed my window
to act like I had the wasabi.

326
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,820
Jong Min was crazy.

327
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,460
We spat out the rice cakes.

328
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,860
When Jong Min spat out
his rice cake,

329
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,390
it was completely intact.

330
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,090
So he bit into it gently.

331
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,000
Once he figured it out,
he never sank his teeth in fully.

332
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,630
(He did his best to pretend
that he was chewing.)

333
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,400
When he spat it out,
it was completely intact.

334
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,970
- He got so much respect from me.
- Gosh, Jong Min.

335
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,400
- The second one...
- Se Yoon had...

336
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,640
the tasty manggaetteok.

337
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,570
He didn't spit it out
and kept on chewing.

338
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,440
- All right.
- Okay.

339
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,380
Team Ho Joon Ho,
you won ten yeopjeons.

340
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,910
- Great.
- Everyone.

341
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,480
Uiryeong is known...

342
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,880
- for its tasty manggaetteok.
- I want to try one.

343
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,150
- You can try 1 each.
- Just 1.

344
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,150
Let me taste it.

345
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,490
- It'd be nice to have just one.
- I'll give it to you.

346
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,490
Try it.

347
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,960
This manggaetteok is
from the rice cake stall...

348
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,990
next to the soba restaurant
at the market.

349
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,190
The owner personally
made the rice cakes.

350
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,560
- Really?
- Manggaetteok.

351
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,900
Are we supposed to eat this cold?

352
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,660
It's to make sure it didn't go bad.
It's hot today.

353
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,070
Gosh, it's so good.

354
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,470
It's tasty.

355
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,470
- This is so good.
- It tastes like dalgona.

356
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,440
- The red bean paste is so good.
- The one with the red beans.

357
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,210
- Gosh, this is good.
- Right?

358
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,470
- You didn't try it?
- Gosh.

359
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,140
- We will...
- Are we going to the base camp?

360
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,780
We'll head over to the base camp.

361
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,050
- Okay.
- Yes.

362
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,480
It's not over yet. Okay.

363
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,650
- Let's go.
- Okay.

364
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,720
- Okay.
- Okay.

365
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,050
Great.
We might be able to have dinner.

366
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,990
- Sae Ho. How about an attaboy?
- Yes?

367
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,320
(You did a great job.)

368
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,690
- You did a great job.
- Right?

369
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,830
You were amazing.

370
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,360
So our teamwork...

371
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,060
- We have great teamwork.
- is perfect.

372
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,630
Seriously. Our teamwork is amazing.

373
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,470
Gosh. That was hard, though.

374
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,070
It was quite confusing.

375
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,300
I could tell DinDin had the wasabi.

376
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,710
- I knew he had the wasabi.
- Right.

377
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,040
I was pretty good today
except for the time...

378
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,910
- I had to get the rice, right?
- Yes.

379
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,610
Seon Ho,
I have newfound respect for you.

380
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,680
- Really?
- Yes.

381
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
That was great, right?

382
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,550
You know what?
Our teamwork is amazing, seriously.

383
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,950
We're doing well as a team today.

384
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,420
This must be it.

385
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,120
It's a kind of forest lodge.

386
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,490
(Today's base camp is located
in the verdant forest.)

387
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,060
It's in the middle of a forest.
This looks great.

388
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,800
What a fancy facility.

389
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,170
We can soak up phytoncides.

390
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,840
Our base camp is on a mountain?

391
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,640
We're sleeping on a mountain today.

392
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,470
The air will be clean then.
I bet it'll be cool at night.

393
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,910
Oh, my. What a gem.

394
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,450
(The base camp is
full of phytoncides.)

395
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,420
(They will take a short break
at the base camp.)

396
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,820
- What?
- What?

397
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,520
Get out now.

398
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,160
- What's going on?
- What are you doing here?

399
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,100
(Suspecting)

400
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,500
(Surprised)

401
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,600
I see snacks.

402
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,930
- What? Snacks?
- Look.

403
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,540
(There are snacks on the counter?)

404
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,270
What's this? I see newspapers.

405
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,140
(Global financial newspapers?)

406
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,880
Why are there newspapers?

407
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,650
Give me The Times.

408
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,180
(Unfamiliar items
for 2 Days and 1 Night)

409
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,250
(He tries to read
the English newspaper.)

410
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,690
Step.

411
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,690
(They start reading
the global financial newspapers.)

412
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,720
And...

413
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,530
- "Glory days."
- Gosh.

414
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,330
- This is bad.
- "Paris."

415
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,330
(He feels he's in trouble
the moment he opens it up.)

416
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,060
The S and P 500 dropped a bit.

417
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,770
- What?
- The S and P 500 dropped a bit.

418
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,300
But why are there newspapers?
What's happening all of a sudden?

419
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,070
Why did they give us the newspapers?

420
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,640
Why did you give us the newspapers?

421
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,440
(Seon Ho had already lost interest.)

422
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,410
All right. Let me read
about our national economy.

423
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,450
(At that moment...)

424
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,220
(Sliding open)

425
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,450
Seon Ho, could you
come outside for a second?

426
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,550
What's going on?

427
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,660
(Startled)

428
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,760
You're out.

429
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,930
I didn't read the newspaper at all.
Am I out?

430
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,000
- You?
- What?

431
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,760
- He's going to scold you.
- I guess the mission is starting.

432
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,030
(He comes outside
without knowing why.)

433
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:55,470
(And the person
waiting for Seon Ho is...)

434
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,280
Wait. What's this?

435
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,810
(A mysterious guy is waiting outside
with a clenched jaw.)

436
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,520
(Drill Instructor)

437
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,090
(Drill Instructor Lee Byung Jin)

438
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,890
(I've been waiting for you,
Seon Ho.)

439
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,990
Byung Jin.

440
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,200
Give me 20 jumping jacks now!

441
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,240
- What is this?
- Do it now!

442
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,300
(What's going on, Byung Jin?)

443
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,470
- One.
- What's going on?

444
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,010
Three.

445
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,750
Four. What? What's this?

446
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,850
(Puzzled)

447
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,150
- Seven.
- Seon Ho.

448
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,850
You broke the rule that...

449
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,480
the wealthy never check
their phone while lying down.

450
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,390
So you will perform
eight drills with me.

451
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,320
But everyone is on their phone
while lying on their back.

452
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,260
Okay. I got it.

453
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,260
(He wants to cry.)

454
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,630
(Hissing)

455
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,040
- Isn't that the sound of a whistle?
- What's that sound?

456
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,640
I think he's doing that
in front of the door.

457
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,310
- We can't go out and look, right?
- No.

458
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,010
That doesn't sound
like a fun activity.

459
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,880
(He wants to cry.)

460
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,150
When you go back,

461
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,550
you will only scream to answer.

462
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,320
If you violate that,
you'll see me again.

463
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,050
Return.

464
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,520
(Seon Ho returns.)

465
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,660
What happened?

466
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
(Screaming)

467
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,600
Hey. Look at him.
What did you do wrong?

468
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,770
(All of a sudden, the youngest
shows great discipline.)

469
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,040
- What's going on?
- What's wrong?

470
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,540
He must be on a mission.

471
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,570
- I feel bad for him.
- What's wrong with him?

472
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,740
Right. You should've behaved
according to the theme today.

473
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,850
- Just read the newspaper.
- What's wrong?

474
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,350
(Se Yoon spots something.)

475
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,450
Are you sad?

476
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,490
My gosh. Let me wash my face
with cold water to wake up.

477
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,490
(Then he's suddenly washing up.)

478
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,030
Let me wash my face
with cold water to wake up.

479
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,100
(What's gotten into him now?)

480
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,500
Se Yoon is doing something
that doesn't align with our trip.

481
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,500
- What's wrong with him?
- Why is he washing his face there?

482
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,300
- That doesn't look appropriate.
- What's wrong with him?

483
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,540
To wake up.

484
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,970
(Why did Se Yoon
suddenly wash his face?)

485
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,950
(Then he starts meditating.)

486
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,020
(Glancing)

487
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,720
(Smiling)

488
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,960
(After sensing something,
Sae Ho comes to check it out.)

489
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,300
(Se Yoon and Sae Ho
have spotted this.)

490
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,470
(The Habits of the Wealthy)

491
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,630
(The wealthy keep
a clean and neat environment.)

492
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,800
(The wealthy don't check
their phone while lying down.)

493
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,840
(These are the 20 habits
the wealthy must keep.)

494
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,610
(The number 1 town
of the wealthy, Uiryeong)

495
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,610
- What?
- What?

496
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,350
(They must follow the habits
of the wealthy in this room.)

497
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,680
I see snacks.

498
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,550
(The wealthy
don't have a greed for food.)

499
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,020
What's this? I see newspapers.

500
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,860
(The wealthy read the newspaper
every day.)

501
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,030
(The wealthy
don't have a greed for food.)

502
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,260
(The wealthy read the newspaper
every day.)

503
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,400
(The traps were set up
all over the room.)

504
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,530
(Seon Ho was on his phone
while lying on his back.)

505
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,270
(The wealthy don't check
their phone while lying down.)

506
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,140
(A hidden mission was prepared
to help them become wealthy.)

507
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,040
(The wealthy take a shower
with cold water.)

508
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,110
(After spotting the paper
with the habits of the wealthy,)

509
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,250
(he's been practicing them
diligently alone.)

510
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,210
(The wealthy meditate every day.)

511
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,250
Thank you.

512
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,990
(The wealthy are grateful
for everything.)

513
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,020
- For what?
- I don't know.

514
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,020
I'm always grateful to you.

515
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,790
Same here.

516
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,890
(The two of them
figured out the mission.)

517
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,920
Gosh, this is fun.

518
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,660
It's nice and cool.

519
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,200
(Getting suspicious)

520
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,000
(Grabbing)

521
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,200
(Regardless,
he goes back to checking his phone.)

522
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,330
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

523
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,470
(Chuckling)

524
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,240
(Wiping off his tears)

525
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,210
- Please go out.
- Go out where?

526
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,780
(Where do you think?)

527
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,180
Count!

528
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,580
One,

529
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,950
two, three.

530
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,080
(May everyone become wealthy.)

531
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,390
Welcome back.

532
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,390
(Jong Min returns
after the training to be wealthy.)

533
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,020
What did you do?

534
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,020
What did you do?

535
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,760
What? What happened? That's odd.

536
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,790
They're acting weird
when they come back.

537
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,830
Why are you screaming?

538
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,460
They told you not to say anything?

539
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,530
(It's so hard to be wealthy.)

540
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,070
(Meanwhile, Joon is
still reading the newspaper.)

541
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,300
- "Shareholders..."
- Was it hard?

542
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,800
- Did they scold you?
- "Shareholders?"

543
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,040
Did it help?

544
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,310
- It's been so long.
- Did it hurt your pride?

545
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,640
(He uses his phone
to look up the word.)

546
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
"Shareholder?"

547
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,450
"Then inspire..."

548
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,180
Joon.

549
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,350
Wait. I'm studying hard. Why...

550
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,520
- Please leave.
- I can't even read on a trip?

551
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,650
One,

552
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,290
two, three.

553
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,020
(Exhausted)

554
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,130
You're back.

555
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,800
Joon.

556
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,900
(He's losing it.)

557
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,030
Are you tired?

558
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,930
All right. Let's do an experiment.

559
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,270
- There's food here.
- Yes.

560
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,370
- If you've been out, eat some.
- Yes.

561
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,110
I can go out again. I'll eat it.

562
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,570
- We should just do it.
- Can we eat this?

563
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,910
Don't ask him. You just eat it.

564
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,310
We're on a trip.
We ought to eat some.

565
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,380
Is that yours?

566
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,780
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
Rock...

567
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,410
Don't count me in.
I don't like that for real.

568
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,580
- You didn't see him eat, right?
- He's eating it.

569
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,620
What?

570
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,420
(Glancing)

571
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,450
Joon.

572
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,920
(Joon...)

573
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,830
(The wealthy
don't have a greed for food.)

574
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,730
(As this is his second time,
he seems to be doing better.)

575
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,770
The wealthy don't show off!

576
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,700
No? Was that wrong?

577
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
(Laughing)

578
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,110
What was that?

579
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,010
(The drill instructor
has a data malfunction.)

580
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,380
The wealthy do show off.

581
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,280
The wealthy
don't have a greed for food!

582
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,850
But they do.

583
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,020
(The habit training of the wealthy
is over.)

584
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,050
Everyone.

585
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,820
- Wake him up.
- By now, you've gotten used...

586
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,720
to the habits of the wealthy, right?

587
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,090
- Yes.
- Wake up DinDin the Kid.

588
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,020
(Sluggish from sleep)

589
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,990
(He had a restful nap.)

590
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,700
Right now,

591
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,070
Team Kim Moon Cheol has
117 yeopjeons.

592
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,070
Yes.

593
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,830
Team Ho Joon Ho has 144 yeopjeons.

594
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,000
(Team Ho Joon Ho has 144 yeopjeons.)

595
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,240
- Is it over?
- The real game is starting now.

596
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,440
- I knew it.
- Gosh.

597
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,580
Soon,
you'll be playing individually.

598
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,780
What?

599
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,880
(Individually?)

600
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,720
You guys all have
the yeopjeons, right?

601
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Yes.

602
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,390
You can divide up the yeopjeons
among yourselves now.

603
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,620
- Gosh.
- But...

604
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,460
you can divide them equally.

605
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,600
It's up to the three of you
on how to divide up the yeopjeons.

606
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,830
Why are there snacks?

607
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,030
Do you want some?

608
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
(Screaming)

609
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,840
Do you want some?

610
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,500
So...

611
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,570
(Stifling a giggle)

612
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,640
- Could you give that to me?
- Okay.

613
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,540
(Munching)

614
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,880
(He ate it.)

615
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,020
DinDin. Please leave.

616
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,990
(DinDin is out.)

617
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,090
Why did you eat it?

618
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,560
(He senses his fate.)

619
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,400
(The wealthy
don't have a greed for food.)

620
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,570
Darn it.

621
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,900
(Suffering an unexpected mishap
after his nap)

622
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Darn it.

623
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,400
You can split 10 yeopjeons
into 3, 3, and 4.

624
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,440
Okay.

625
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,840
- Let's divide them equally.
- Right.

626
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,170
All right. Let's do that.
We have no other choice.

627
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,580
- Let's take 48 each.
- It won't work.

628
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,650
To take 40 each, we'd need 120.

629
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,480
Since you didn't do much today,
take only 37.

630
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,750
- I'm sorry.
- DinDin and I will take 40.

631
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,890
I'm sorry.
I'm holding the yeopjeons.

632
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,020
It won't even take 30 seconds
to take them from you.

633
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,230
So no? You don't want that?

634
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,230
Let's take 39 yeopjeons each
while he's outside.

635
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,030
(They decide to divide
the yeopjeons equally too.)

636
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,130
Let's split them. Jong Min.

637
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,570
I'll do it. Stay there.

638
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,170
Lastly, face that side
and scream for three seconds.

639
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,340
Now!

640
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,610
(Screaming)

641
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,040
(The current tally of the yeopjeons)

642
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,050
Keep going!

643
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,750
(Jong Min, Se Yoon, and DinDin: 39)

644
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,520
(Sae Ho, Joon, and Seon Ho: 48)

645
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,650
Come on, be reasonable.
Give me more yeopjeons.

646
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,350
(He made
the biggest contribution today.)

647
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,320
- He said no.
- Give me more.

648
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,030
Let me see yours.
How many do you have?

649
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,030
- Thirty-nine.
- Take them out.

650
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,060
I'm telling the truth.

651
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,900
Come on. Take them out.

652
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,400
I didn't walk down that much.

653
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,000
What's going on?

654
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,270
- What are these?
- They are caravans.

655
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,610
- Caravans.
- What...

656
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,210
(Why are there caravans?)

657
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,910
The yeopjeon symbol is on the vans.

658
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,040
I guess
we'll have to spend our yeopjeons.

659
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,880
The lottery room. The onion room?

660
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,380
Onion? Lottery?

661
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,450
The onion room?

662
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,290
(What will they do here?)

663
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,620
- Come on.
- All right. Yes?

664
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,360
Jong Min
didn't give me my yeopjeons.

665
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,260
He was broke.
He didn't do anything for our team.

666
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,830
- Jong Min...
- We divided them equally.

667
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,260
He only earned four,
but took everything.

668
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,200
Give me more yeopjeons.

669
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,500
- Okay. I'll give them to you later.
- Jong Min.

670
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,570
- Wait.
- Later when?

671
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,340
- Just give them to me now.
- Gosh, I'll earn more.

672
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,400
Give me two more.

673
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Since I did well today,

674
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,640
- give me 50.
- That's enough.

675
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,370
- What have you done today?
- Stop...

676
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,180
What are you talking about?
I was hilarious today.

677
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,280
- You divided the yeopjeons, right?
- Yes.

678
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,310
- All right then.
- Yes.

679
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:01,080
You have one last time
to earn more yeopjeons.

680
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,490
- For the next 30 minutes,
- What?

681
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,090
you can freely try
to earn more yeopjeons.

682
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,990
- Great.
- Okay.

683
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,260
(The current tally of the yeopjeons)

684
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,530
(Jong Min, Se Yoon, and DinDin: 39)

685
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,930
(Sae Ho, Joon, and Seon Ho: 48)

686
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,430
I'll swing big then.

687
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,370
- I'll go for the ten yeopjeons too.
- The onion room...

688
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,800
(Sae Ho goes straight
to the gold room.)

689
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,900
Hey, Hyun Woo. Nice to see you.

690
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,470
(What will he do in the gold room?)

691
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,840
I might not play the game.

692
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,110
I'm here to test out the waters.

693
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,040
So if I give you ten yeopjeons,

694
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,610
I can buy a lottery ticket?

695
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,010
Yes.

696
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,550
(They can buy lottery tickets
at the lottery rooms.)

697
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,820
The lottery ticket here
costs ten yeopjeons.

698
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,820
The prize money is 20 yeopjeons.

699
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,130
The lottery ticket here
costs five yeopjeons.

700
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,260
Five. Okay.

701
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,130
The prize money is ten yeopjeons.

702
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,830
(The prize money is 10 yeopjeons.)

703
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,500
(The prize money is small,)

704
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,170
(but the loss is also small
in the silver room.)

705
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,500
(The prize money is big,)

706
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,700
(but the loss is also big
in the gold room.)

707
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,510
However, you can buy...

708
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,640
only one lottery ticket per person.

709
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,080
You have a 50-percent chance of winning,
and 1 of them is a dud.

710
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,710
Would you like to buy it now?

711
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,820
Would you like to buy it?

712
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,090
You can buy it now.

713
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,020
Or you can think about it.

714
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,560
- Would you like to buy it?
- I'd like to buy it.

715
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,730
Please pay.

716
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,360
(Se Yoon buys
a lottery ticket immediately...)

717
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,700
(with 5 yeopjeons.)

718
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,730
Please pick 1 of the 2.

719
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,510
(Going big or going home)

720
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,610
I'm right-handed.

721
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,450
So I always pick the one
on the right.

722
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,180
However,

723
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,520
this is your right.

724
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,490
I will pick from your perspective.

725
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,890
- Aren't you right-handed?
- I am.

726
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,490
This is it.

727
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,090
- You made your choice.
- Okay.

728
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,790
Please take a look.

729
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,790
If I fail, may I try one more time?

730
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,800
No.

731
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,700
You already bought one,
so it's over.

732
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,570
- My chances are up?
- Yes.

733
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,900
It's impossible to turn
my life around in this room.

734
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,070
(Just 1 ticket?
That's almost nothing.)

735
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,600
- This is the silver room.
- The silver room?

736
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,970
That's subtle.

737
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,340
(You must get 3 yeopjeons to win.)

738
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,080
I'll start from the edge.

739
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,350
(It's time to check the result.)

740
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,280
Please...

741
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,280
I got a yeopjeon.

742
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,050
It's a yeopjeon.

743
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,420
(The first drawing is a yeopjeon.)

744
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,820
- I'll scratch the second.
- Okay.

745
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,290
No, I'll look at the first one.

746
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,260
Let's see.

747
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,730
(The second drawing is
also a yeopjeon.)

748
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,430
(Will he win the lottery?)

749
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,700
Usually, the middle one is
never a dud.

750
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,400
Let's see.

751
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,340
(I can't stand to look.)

752
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,210
(Please let it be another yeopjeon.)

753
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,780
(Desperate)

754
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,950
(Will the last drawing
also be a yeopjeon?)

755
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,990
Here it is.

756
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,650
(Instant Lottery
to Increase Your Yeopjeon)

757
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,390
(Onion)

758
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,990
Did I win?

759
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,530
Please take a look.

760
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,990
Goodness.

761
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,030
Se Yoon, it's a dud.

762
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,330
(Moon Se Yoon got a dud
in the silver room.)

763
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,430
I should've chosen my perspective.

764
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,640
(His life remains the same.)

765
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,370
First of all...

766
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,640
(Sae Ho is wondering if
he should buy the lottery ticket.)

767
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,510
I should take a risk
for a good meal.

768
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,810
(Buying the lottery ticket
with 10 yeopjeons)

769
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,110
Do you mind not counting them?

770
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,720
I'd like a sense of trust
between us.

771
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,950
You're counting them.

772
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,620
It's ten indeed.

773
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,490
I came here to trust you.

774
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,660
Okay.

775
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,760
- Do I pick 1 of the 2?
- Yes.

776
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,930
Without touching?

777
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,800
(He will get 20 yeopjeons
if he wins.)

778
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,970
(It's a chance
to turn his life around.)

779
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,470
(He picks one carefully.)

780
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,140
I need to get
three yeopjeons to win.

781
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,270
Yes.

782
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,840
It should appear by now,
but I don't see it.

783
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,580
(The first drawing is a yeopjeon.)

784
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,480
(His chance of winning increased.)

785
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,490
Wait.

786
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,820
(A pale drawing)

787
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,490
(He scratches it in a hurry.)

788
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,860
- Is it a dud?
- Yes.

789
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,990
(It's definitely an onion.)

790
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,830
You got a dud.

791
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,430
- Why...
- You may go out.

792
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,570
- I need to check the other one.
- Do you want to?

793
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,500
Shouldn't I check?

794
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,670
The other one could be a dud too.

795
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,770
- Just in case?
- Yes.

796
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,070
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

797
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,940
(He checks the other one.)

798
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,110
You don't trust me.

799
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,150
(The other one is
the winning ticket.)

800
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,780
You may go.

801
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,420
(The number of yeopjeons)

802
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,250
(Se Yeoon: 34, Sae Ho: 38)

803
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,360
I'll tell them that I won.

804
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
(Laughing with joy)

805
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,830
What is it?

806
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,500
Hey, this is no joke.

807
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,230
(Pretending to be successful)

808
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,330
He lost ten.

809
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,800
- That's not true.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

810
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,200
I can tell from looking at you.

811
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,210
- You definitely lost.
- Listen to me.

812
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,940
Do you think I trust you?

813
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,580
- I'll show you.
- Show me.

814
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,880
Why can't you trust me?

815
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,580
I have this much.
Don't take it away.

816
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,220
(Anyway, Sae Ho's life
hasn't changed either.)

817
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,120
(Both Joon and DinDin go
into the onion room.)

818
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,160
I'll make it with hard work.

819
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,090
- What do we have to do?
- I'll make it with hard work.

820
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,260
What do we have to do?

821
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

822
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,160
This is a room where
humble efforts are made...

823
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,700
- to earn yeonjeons.
- Okay.

824
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,000
Yes, this is what I like.

825
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,340
Cut the onions just like the sample
in front of you.

826
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,640
For each onion,
you'll get one yeonjeon.

827
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,980
- One?
- Yes.

828
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,910
One is so little.

829
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,880
It will take so long.

830
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,120
- By the way...
- My eyes are tearing up already.

831
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,180
Just one?

832
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,690
- One?
- Yes.

833
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,920
- You want to make it on your own?
- Yes.

834
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,320
(I'd like to make it on my own.)

835
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,630
(DinDin valued hard work
over becoming suddenly rich.)

836
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,430
(Working hard
according to his belief)

837
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,470
It stings my eyes.

838
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,440
Oh, no. My eyes are tearing up.

839
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,940
It stings my eyes.

840
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,770
Gosh, I'm tearing up.

841
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,740
It stings my eyes.

842
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,380
- I'm done.
- Okay.

843
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,120
Here's one yeopjeon.
You can take it later.

844
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,450
- Just leave it there.
- Congratulations.

845
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,590
- Here's one yeopjeon.
- Thank you.

846
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,920
I can't do this.

847
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,790
I can't stay here.

848
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,390
- Thank you.
- It stings my eyes so much.

849
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,930
I don't like this work.

850
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,160
- Goodness.
- That was unpleasant.

851
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,660
My eyes sting so much.

852
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,470
- This isn't worth it.
- What about...

853
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,700
(Some things are impossible
to get with hard work.)

854
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,940
My eyes sting.

855
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,640
Two of you may come in.

856
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,840
- Shall I put on the gloves?
- Let me explain.

857
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,980
Wait a minute.

858
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,210
(Gosh, it smells.)

859
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,810
- Could we also get those goggles?
- No.

860
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,420
- Why not?
- These are mine.

861
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,320
(My eyes sting too.)

862
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,050
Hand me the gloves too.
We came here together.

863
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,190
Hey, listen. How rude...

864
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,820
You have a 50-percent chance
of winning.

865
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,760
One of them is successful.
The other is a dud.

866
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,530
- Would you like to buy it now?
- Yes.

867
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,900
Please pay.

868
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,270
(The one who dreamed to be
self-made is watching them.)

869
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,900
Pick 1 of the 2.

870
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,340
(Seon Ho bought a lottery ticket.)

871
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,410
This will be so thrilling.

872
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,510
(What will be the result?)

873
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,840
Okay, I got one for now.

874
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,580
(The first drawing is a yeopjeon.)

875
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,610
I got one. Shall I scratch
the last drawing?

876
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,850
(Curious)

877
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,650
I got two.

878
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,120
(He has only one left.)

879
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,560
I'll scratch gently from the edge.

880
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,420
Let it be three.

881
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,330
(He won the lottery.)

882
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:34,500
(I can't believe how lucky I am.)

883
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,270
Congratulations, Seon Ho. You won.

884
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,370
(He wins 20 yeopjeons.)

885
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,810
- Seriously?
- Yes.

886
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,380
From now on, it'll be
more advantageous for you...

887
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,820
if the other members don't know
how many you have.

888
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,950
I'll never tell them.

889
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,720
Seon Ho won the lottery
and got 20 more yeopjeons.

890
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,060
(His dream to be self-made is
getting swayed.)

891
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,190
(He invests 10 yeopjeons
to turn his life around.)

892
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,630
I gave you ten.

893
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,430
That's ten.

894
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,600
All right.

895
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,900
(Being sneaky under the table)

896
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,540
- That's 10.
- Yes, now it's 10.

897
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,040
(Making sure that it's 10)

898
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
- Okay.
- Go ahead and scratch it.

899
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,440
(He scratches the lottery ticket...)

900
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,380
(hoping to win after Seon Ho.)

901
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,980
(Onion)

902
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,080
(DinDin gets a dud.)

903
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,420
(He lost his 10 yeopjeons
in an instant.)

904
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,190
(Did I cut onions for this?)

905
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,590
(He keeps scratching in denial.)

906
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,830
Wait, I have a question.

907
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,630
How do I know if the other ticket
has three yeopjeons?

908
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,700
(He's suspicious of the director
right away.)

909
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,730
- Give it to me.
- Go ahead and scratch it.

910
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,930
- Let me scratch it.
- Go ahead.

911
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,100
Give it to me.

912
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,270
I need to check the other one.

913
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,440
(How is everyone the same?)

914
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,970
- Can I try one more time?
- You got a dud.

915
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,240
I can't try one more time?

916
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,780
(No, you can't.)

917
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,180
(He goes straight
to the silver room to recover.)

918
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,920
- What are you doing?
- I'm just here.

919
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,820
Get out of my way.

920
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,590
- I was here first.
- Get out of my way.

921
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,890
- Darn it.
- I was here first.

922
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,920
I was here first.

923
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,360
(Seon Ho comes
into the silver room.)

924
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,430
I'll make a bet.

925
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,130
- Would you like to buy it?
- Yes.

926
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,470
I just won in the gold room.

927
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,740
(Sharing his accomplishment
that he's proud of)

928
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,840
- Oh, my.
- I'll wager five.

929
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,210
You bought it with five yeopjeons.

930
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,840
Please pick 1 of the 2.

931
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,910
I'll follow the routine from before.

932
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,980
(Routine?)

933
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,450
(Actually, in order to succeed,)

934
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,180
(he exposed them to various lights.)

935
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,190
(He went through various routines
to succeed.)

936
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,160
(Reenacting each
and every one of them)

937
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,060
Like before, I can't see anything.

938
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,190
(Observing him closely)

939
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,460
I'll start by scratching
the 1st and the 3rd like before.

940
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,660
(Will he succeed again this time?)

941
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,060
I'll scratch the third one.

942
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,230
(Careful)

943
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,400
Next, I drew a rectangle.

944
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,410
(I need to keep a poker face.)

945
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,510
Hurry up and come out.

946
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,080
(He can't see the result.)

947
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,250
Come out already.

948
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,950
This room is futile.

949
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,890
(Seon Ho won 10 yeopjeons.)

950
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,720
- Here you go.
- I won.

951
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,260
(Like a professional actor,
he puts on a poker face right away.)

952
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,730
(DinDin gives it a try.)

953
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,800
Please pick 1 of the 2.

954
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,000
(DinDin is in need.)

955
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,670
(Following the winner's routine)

956
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,940
(Thinking)

957
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,780
(It's his last chance
to turn his life around.)

958
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,580
(What will be the result?)

959
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,780
Goodness.

960
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,280
(Onion)

961
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,580
(DinDin fails.)

962
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Gosh.

963
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,490
(Bankrupt)

964
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,490
DinDin, you got a dud.

965
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,360
(His yeopjeons got reduced
from 40 to 25.)

966
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,830
(The number of yeopjeons)

967
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,330
(DinDin in last place,
Seon Ho in first place)

968
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,800
Could you let me gamble
one more time?

969
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,630
(He depleted his chance
of buying lottery tickets.)

970
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,270
Could you let me gamble
one more time?

971
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,540
You can't go in there, DinDin.

972
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,440
Get out of there.

973
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,240
(Labor is the only way
for him to revive.)

974
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,910
(However, the onion room is
already full.)

975
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,210
(Why is Joon
in the onion room again?)

976
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,250
(He went to the lottery ticket room
with lots of ambition.)

977
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,480
You got a dud.

978
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,680
(He failed in the gold room.)

979
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,850
I believe in myself...

980
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,490
- Darn it.
- Joon, you got a dud.

981
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,160
It's not good to flee.

982
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,360
I'll earn money by chopping onions.

983
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,830
(That's how he stayed
in the onion room the longest.)

984
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,400
(Soon, he filled up his bowl.)

985
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,500
Doesn't it sting?

986
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,500
(After chopping onions quietly
for a long time)

987
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,440
(Tears slowly welling up)

988
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,650
It's so hard.

989
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,280
(It's not easy to earn yeopjeon.)

990
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,880
My eyes are tearing up so much.

991
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,820
(It's also hard
for the production crew.)

992
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,520
(He's practically crying.)

993
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,590
Even though it stings,
I belong in this room.

994
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,060
By working as much as possible...

995
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
(The onion room)

996
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,870
(The sound of cutting continues
in the onion room.)

997
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,940
(At the same time, in the gold room)

998
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,610
(Are they sitting face-to-face?)

999
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,440
He's plotting with the dealer.

1000
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,050
(Being wary)

1001
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,510
How about scratching them
at the same time?

1002
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,920
I get only one chance anyway.

1003
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,690
(The result of the lottery is
revealed at the same time.)

1004
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,560
I found it.

1005
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,160
Did you get the same? Darn it.

1006
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,890
(So far, the result is the same.)

1007
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,400
(Being wary)

1008
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,070
All right.

1009
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,700
(Tight defense)

1010
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,670
(Guarding so closely
that even the cameras can't see it)

1011
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,040
(Curious)

1012
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,510
Darn it.

1013
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,310
Darn it.

1014
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,220
(Okay, he also got a dud.)

1015
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,220
(However, Se Yoon looks happy.)

1016
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,920
(The situation a few minutes ago)

1017
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,130
(He won the lottery.)

1018
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,560
(Keeping a poker face)

1019
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,760
(After showing it to the director,)

1020
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,930
(he hides it from the others.)

1021
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,970
(He won 20 yeopjeons.)

1022
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,340
(The deal is carried out
discreetly.)

1023
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,880
I got them.

1024
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,750
Congratulations, Jong Min.

1025
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,420
(The others hit the jackpot
in a row.)

1026
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,150
Okay.

1027
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,320
(The lottery rooms are closed.)

1028
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,620
(But where is Joon?)

1029
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,020
(Cutting)

1030
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,630
(Cutting)

1031
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,960
(The onion inferno isn't over.)

1032
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,070
(Please spare me.)

1033
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,940
(His cutting shows
no sign of stopping.)

1034
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,510
(Madness)

1035
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,540
(Joon's seventh onion)

1036
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,540
Well done.

1037
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,580
One, two, three. I got seven.

1038
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,180
I'm happy with that.

1039
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,880
I'll never gamble again.

1040
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,380
(The onion room is also closed.)

1041
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,650
Being in that room makes you dizzy.

1042
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,790
I feel dizzy.

1043
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,920
(He starts feeling the aftereffect
of the onion room.)

1044
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:06,360
Everyone, each of you had
a chance of getting lucky.

1045
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,000
- Now, we'll move...
- Let's go and eat.

1046
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,530
to your dinner spot.

1047
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,530
- Yes.
- Okay.

1048
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,570
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1049
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,470
(They head to dinner
with the yeopjeons they won.)

1050
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,670
Please. I smell something delicious.

1051
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,640
What is it?

1052
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,180
- What's this?
- What's going on here?

1053
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,510
What's this?

1054
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,950
Is it contact-free or what?

1055
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,380
(They sit down for now.)

1056
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,890
What's this? It's a new version.

1057
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,520
What's going on?

1058
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,160
- I don't see others.
- Yes.

1059
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,230
Since this morning, I've been saying
that tonight's dinner will be huge.

1060
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,230
Yes.

1061
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,890
With the yeopjeons
that you earned today,

1062
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,060
you'll buy yourself dinner.

1063
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,670
Our chef made tonight's dinner
with heart and soul.

1064
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,340
It's a luxurious course meal
with Uiryeong's local specialties.

1065
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,900
She made it with her heart and soul?

1066
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,140
- Yes.
- That's impressive.

1067
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,540
From now on, a course meal
of 13 dishes will be...

1068
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,880
- served in order.
- Thirteen dishes?

1069
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,010
- Thirteen dishes?
- Yes.

1070
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,210
If you'd like to have the dish,

1071
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,620
put yeopjeons on the tray
in front of you...

1072
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,050
to make a bid.

1073
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,350
It will be sold to the one
with the highest bid.

1074
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,720
Even if it doesn't get sold,

1075
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,530
we won't return the yeopjeons
you put on the tray.

1076
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,960
That's the worst.

1077
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,500
If your bid isn't successful,
you'll just keep spending.

1078
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,600
That's correct.

1079
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,400
Having a lot isn't the best.

1080
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,700
I could lose all in one go.

1081
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,470
I guarantee you that I'll go all in.

1082
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,040
I'll bid my everything on one dish.

1083
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,170
- By the way,
- Yes?

1084
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,440
is there durian?

1085
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,080
(Bad memories of the auction
creep back into his mind.)

1086
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,110
(He always got durian at auctions.)

1087
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,920
(He even got durian parfait
that he's never seen before.)

1088
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,990
(The durian collector
on 2 Days and 1 Night)

1089
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,490
Se Yoon, durian is
the main dish at this place.

1090
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,520
I see.

1091
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,060
There may be a dish
that no one bids.

1092
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,560
In that case, I'll enjoy it myself.

1093
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,630
I can't let that happen.

1094
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,300
I'll bid, no matter what.

1095
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,840
All right.
Please bring the first dish.

1096
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,740
The first dish will be good
so that we spend money.

1097
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,470
(The chef appears.)

1098
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,640
- Here it is.
- It's here.

1099
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,680
Hello.

1100
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,010
- Please show us.
- We can stand up.

1101
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,150
Is it a taco?

1102
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,180
(Curious)

1103
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,580
(What's that?)

1104
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,090
- We haven't seen you in a while.
- Hello.

1105
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,790
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

1106
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,120
Served in a crispy shell is...

1107
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,630
oyster mushroom japchae,
which is Uiryeong's specialty.

1108
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,330
It's a bite-sized delight.

1109
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,260
(Oyster mushroom japchae
inside a crispy rice shell)

1110
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,060
It looks so delicious.

1111
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,800
We can enjoy it like a taco.

1112
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,900
- Chef.
- Today...

1113
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,300
- It looks so good.
- Compared to usual,

1114
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,440
how much passion
did you put into the dish?

1115
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,480
- About 200 percent.
- Really?

1116
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,710
- About 200 percent.
- Really?

1117
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,050
You made
one of the best dishes of your life.

1118
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,050
Seriously?

1119
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,580
She made it with her heart and soul.

1120
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,190
To make a bid,

1121
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,290
place yeopjeons on your tray.

1122
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,760
How many should I put?

1123
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,330
I'll go all in.
You guys shouldn't put any.

1124
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,260
I'll give you one minute.

1125
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,430
(Number of yeopjeons that they have)

1126
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,270
(Anguished)

1127
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,670
(Oyster mushroom japchae)

1128
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,940
(Should I eat it or not?)

1129
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,670
(His brain running at full capacity)

1130
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,880
Instead of bidding carelessly...

1131
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,550
and losing the dish...

1132
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,780
Exactly.

1133
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:15,020
- I'll still go all in.
- In that case...

1134
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,120
Why are you looking?

1135
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,260
Why are you looking?

1136
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,260
(A scandalous incident occurs
during their bidding.)

1137
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,990
If someone looks at others,

1138
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,290
we should take away ten from him.

1139
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,530
Starting now, if you get caught
looking at others,

1140
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,300
- we'll take away ten yeopjeons.
- Starting when?

1141
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,400
- Starting now.
- Okay.

1142
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,300
(A drastic measure
for the Cheater King)

1143
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,540
I'm so curious all of a sudden.

1144
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,140
(He gets more curious
because he's not allowed to look.)

1145
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,610
I'm dying to look at others.

1146
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,240
All right, you have 20 seconds.

1147
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,140
Oh, my. I don't know what to do.

1148
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,610
I'm very hungry right now.

1149
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,380
I'll just go all in.

1150
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,980
- I will bid ten.
- Okay.

1151
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,490
- Six is enough.
- All in.

1152
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,160
(Pretending to bid a lot)

1153
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,190
(Sae Ho bids 5.)

1154
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,960
(This should be enough.)

1155
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,230
Five, four,

1156
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,770
three, two, one.

1157
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,540
Time is up.

1158
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,170
(Whose bid will be successful?)

1159
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,210
All right.

1160
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,740
The successful one has been decided.

1161
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,910
I definitely won.

1162
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,250
I won, no matter what.

1163
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,810
(Which member will get
the first dish?)

1164
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,120
- Chef, please bring it to me.
- It's me.

1165
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,150
No, it's me.

1166
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,850
(Sae Ho bid 5.)

1167
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,490
(Anticipating)

1168
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,690
What? Really?

1169
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,660
(She passes Sae Ho
who's anticipating.)

1170
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,690
Thank you.

1171
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,600
(Thank you.)

1172
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,430
What?

1173
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,530
You're impressive.

1174
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,830
I'm a man.

1175
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,540
(The bidding status a moment ago)

1176
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,170
(Joon: 0)

1177
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,610
(Seon Ho: 0)

1178
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,980
(Jong Min: 0)

1179
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,250
(Se Yoon: 4)

1180
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,380
(Sae Ho: 5)

1181
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,450
One.

1182
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,080
(DinDin: 12)

1183
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,550
(A bold player who makes
a big move from the start)

1184
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,220
- Can I go ahead and eat it?
- Yes.

1185
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,960
- Are you eating it in one bite?
- No, in a few bites.

1186
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,060
Look at the flowers.

1187
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,490
It looks so beautiful.

1188
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,630
- Did you get a good insert?
- Yes.

1189
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,160
- Can you eat those flowers?
- These are edible.

1190
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,630
It might hurt.

1191
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,200
(Crunchy)

1192
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,470
It looks delicious.

1193
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,410
Did you hear the crunching sound?

1194
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,740
It must be so good.

1195
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,740
The fried shell looks crispy.

1196
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,040
(Humming)

1197
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,480
- It must be good.
- It looks delicious.

1198
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,510
Is it good?

1199
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,050
The crunchy texture,
oyster mushrooms,

1200
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,990
and the vegetables inside make
a great combination.

1201
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,060
You know what's funny?

1202
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,720
I thought that it was enough to win.

1203
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,260
This is interesting.

1204
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,260
(A bitter smile)

1205
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,230
- Now...
- So we're doing this 13 times?

1206
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,230
Yes.

1207
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,670
Please bring in the second dish.

1208
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,340
- I hope the serving size is big.
- I hope so too.

1209
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,440
You're allowed to stand up
to see the food.

1210
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,910
- What is it?
- What is it?

1211
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,040
(The second dish: Shiitake mushroom
Korean beef yukhoe)

1212
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,110
To yukhoe that's packed with umami,

1213
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,080
I added sourness
with pickled shiitake mushroom.

1214
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,750
I also added nuttiness
with macadamia nuts.

1215
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,020
(Macadamia nuts were added
for a nutty taste.)

1216
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,620
- I must eat this.
- But...

1217
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,060
I can't miss yukhoe since I'm here.

1218
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,490
(I must eat Korean beef
since I'm in Uiryeong.)

1219
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,460
- It's hard to decide.
- Everyone.

1220
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,530
Put yeopjeons on your tray.

1221
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
(Should I bid for it or not?)

1222
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,230
I'm going all in.

1223
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,200
I'm going all in too. Okay.

1224
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,670
(The meat lover bids again.)

1225
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,470
Five, four,

1226
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,470
(He bids 15 yeopjeons this time.)

1227
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,980
three, two, one.

1228
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,580
(Thud)

1229
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,880
(Joon pretends to put yeopjeons
and then takes them back.)

1230
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,120
Time's up. Hands off.

1231
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,850
All right.

1232
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,690
If I don't win this one,
I'll suffer a great loss.

1233
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,720
I will eat this one.
It is what it is.

1234
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,490
The winner has been decided.

1235
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,960
- Really?
- Okay.

1236
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,000
- Please give it to the winner.
- Was it neck and neck?

1237
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,160
(The nerve-racking moment)

1238
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:51,470
Who's the highest bidder?
Please let me have it.

1239
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,870
Please let it be me.

1240
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,210
- What? For real?
- This is crazy.

1241
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,940
- Are you serious?
- This is crazy.

1242
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,340
(Seon Ho wins.)

1243
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,080
(Dumbfounded)

1244
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,850
(But I bid 15 yeopjeons.)

1245
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,880
- I'm done for.
- How much do you have left?

1246
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,750
Really? Are you serious?

1247
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:11,620
- I'm done for.
- Thank you.

1248
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,620
This is crazy.

1249
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,890
I really like shiitake mushroom.

1250
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,060
- Raw shiitake mushrooms are in it.
- I must have this dish.

1251
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,230
- That must be chewy and nice.
- I wanted to have this so much too.

1252
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,730
How much should I have bid?

1253
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,070
I'll enjoy this, ma'am.

1254
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,800
How much did you bid for this?

1255
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,900
Sae Ho lost a lot of money.

1256
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,740
I lost a lot of money, indeed.
I really did.

1257
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,210
Has he lost his mind?
How much did he bid?

1258
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,210
(Seon Ho can't hear it.)

1259
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,580
I mean, I've wasted so much money.

1260
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,080
Tell me.
How much should I bid for food?

1261
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,520
(He wasted 20 yeopjeons
without even eating anything.)

1262
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,750
Seriously, this is... Ma'am.

1263
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,220
- With my hand on my heart,
- Yes?

1264
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:45,950
this is the best yukhoe
I've ever had.

1265
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,120
- Really?
- I'm serious.

1266
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,720
- I should've won it.
- I'm serious.

1267
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,730
(It's the best yukhoe
he's ever had in his life.)

1268
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,430
Macadamia nuts are very aromatic,

1269
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,160
so I'm sure
it goes well with yukhoe.

1270
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,200
Please bring in the third dish.

1271
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,800
(The third dish appears.)

1272
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,070
- I bet that's the main dish.
- What is it?

1273
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,870
- That must be the real deal.
- They won't tell us what it is.

1274
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,070
- What? Is this it?
- What?

1275
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,570
- That must be durian.
- This isn't fair.

1276
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,380
It must be durian.

1277
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,710
- This is...
- Gosh. This must be...

1278
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,610
This is a hidden course.

1279
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:10,610
All right.

1280
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,520
I'll give you a hint on the dish.

1281
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,450
- Is it durian?
- It has an ingredient...

1282
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,450
that's popular especially in summer.

1283
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,490
In summer?

1284
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,990
It's both tasty and nutritious.

1285
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,060
Since you say it's nutritious,
it doesn't sound very tempting now.

1286
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:27,000
If you want to bid for it,
put yeopjeons on your tray.

1287
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,500
My gosh. This is driving me nuts.

1288
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,170
I've gotten it before,
so it's driving me crazy.

1289
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,430
(These two members are
contemplating as well.)

1290
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,500
It's probably durian
just like last time.

1291
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:36,640
I should at least have this one.

1292
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:40,840
I'm sure it's durian.
I'll eat durian again.

1293
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,750
- Five.
- I'll bid for it too.

1294
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,110
Five.

1295
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,220
(He adds 5 yeopjeons
to the 10 yeopjeons he already bid.)

1296
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,220
Four.

1297
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,380
Three.

1298
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,950
Two.

1299
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,060
(Sae Ho fell for the bluff.)

1300
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,060
One.

1301
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,090
I'll give you five more seconds.

1302
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,790
Why would you do that?

1303
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,060
- Should I take some back?
- All right.

1304
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,130
(Trying to read his face)

1305
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,070
- My, this is so tasty.
- You have five seconds.

1306
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,370
Five.

1307
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,640
(He puts yeopjeons hastily
thinking no one has bid for it.)

1308
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,640
Four.

1309
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,970
(He puts yeopjeons hastily
thinking no one has bid for it.)

1310
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,010
Three.

1311
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,040
Two.
(Pretending to put yeopjeons)

1312
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,440
- One.
- What's that noise?

1313
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,680
Could that be some cookies?

1314
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,250
Okay.

1315
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,780
(Contemplating)

1316
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,750
- Give us five more seconds.
- Okay.

1317
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,020
Five.

1318
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,120
Four.

1319
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,260
(Adding 5 yeopjeons
to the 15 yeopjeons he already bid)

1320
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,260
Three.

1321
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,490
(Jong Min adds more yeopjeons too.)

1322
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:29,490
Two.

1323
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,660
One.

1324
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,690
(The competition for the hidden dish
suddenly became fierce.)

1325
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,060
This is your last chance. Time's up.

1326
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,160
Maybe it's not what I think it is.

1327
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,670
- Is it over?
- The winner has been decided.

1328
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,800
Who could that be?

1329
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,500
Ma'am, please serve the dish.

1330
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,640
(Sae Ho bid 20 yeopjeons,
being completely determined.)

1331
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,670
Really?

1332
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,810
Please. Could you please come
to this end and go back?

1333
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:46,980
Oh, what?
Where are you going with the food?

1334
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,250
(Sae Ho wins with 20 yeopjeons.)

1335
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,780
(Finally)

1336
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,120
- What is it?
- What is it?

1337
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,220
(Surprised)

1338
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,190
- What is it?
- What is it?

1339
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,360
- What is it?
- Is it snot?

1340
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,390
(The third dish that Sae Ho won)

1341
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,460
What is it?

1342
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,160
What is that?

1343
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,060
What is that? It looks like sand.

1344
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,030
- What is that?
- What is it?

1345
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,770
- What is it?
- This is not cool at all.

1346
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,300
(It's protein shake
that cost 20 yeopjeons.)

1347
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,610
Hey,
she didn't even give him any milk.

1348
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,070
But why is this a seasonal food?

1349
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,440
- Why?
- I heard many drink it in summer.

1350
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,050
- What?
- Who told you that nonsense?

1351
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,210
- Look at Sae Ho's face.
- Sae Ho...

1352
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,010
Sae Ho seems really upset.

1353
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,780
- He's in shock.
- Are you all right?

1354
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,220
By the way, Sae Ho...

1355
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,750
I bid a lot of money.

1356
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,790
- Sae Ho has no money left.
- Jong Hyun.

1357
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,460
I bet he bid at least ten yeopjeons
for this.

1358
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,130
I bid 20 yeopjeons.

1359
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,070
For this one?

1360
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,730
- For the one you won?
- Yes.

1361
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,840
- In that case, it adds up.
- I...

1362
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,770
I'll tell you. I bid 20 yeopjeons.

1363
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,540
- Why?
- He bid 20 yeopjeons for this?

1364
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,980
Because I thought
it was something great.

1365
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,940
I think it's too thick.

1366
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,150
- It's too thick.
- You should add more water.

1367
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:00,580
- Please bring in the next dish.
- I can't see it.

1368
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,750
- What is it?
- What is it?

1369
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,050
I steamed an abalone
for three hours...

1370
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:08,020
and filled the inside with beef.
It's beef abalone dumpling.

1371
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,760
- Look at that.
- It looks really tasty. Hold on.

1372
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,760
(The fourth dish: Abalone dumpling)

1373
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,400
Oh, my. This is driving me nuts.

1374
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,560
- The way I see it,
- This is driving me crazy.

1375
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,230
it's the trickiest to decide
how much to bid for this dish.

1376
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,730
It's hard to decide.

1377
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:20,870
(From now on, they have to
read one another's minds to win.)

1378
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:21,870
This is driving me crazy.

1379
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,710
I'll give you ten seconds.

1380
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,140
Ten. Nine.

1381
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,580
(Jong Min bids again.)

1382
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,640
Eight.

1383
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,080
- Seven.
- Oh, gosh. This is hard.

1384
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,110
Six.

1385
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,450
This is...

1386
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,080
- It's really hard to decide.
- Five.

1387
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,350
- Four.
- It's so hard to decide.

1388
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,550
- Three.
- It's the hardest to decide.

1389
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,720
- Two.
- I really don't know what to do.

1390
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,860
- One.
- I'm not so hungry,

1391
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,030
- but it looks so tasty.
- Right.

1392
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,700
(Both of them bid 10 yeopjeons.)

1393
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,130
That's it. Time's up.

1394
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,170
- I'm sure that it's enough.
- All right.

1395
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:55,300
The competition for this one
was really intense.

1396
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,070
- Oh, really?
- Really?

1397
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,640
I should've bid one more yeopjeon.
I have a bad feeling about this.

1398
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,040
Me too.

1399
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,280
I bid quite a lot of yeopjeons
this time.

1400
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,750
(Who will have abalone dumpling?)

1401
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,880
(Sae Ho wins again.)

1402
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,050
What?

1403
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,590
(It unfolded unexpectedly.)

1404
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:12,650
What?

1405
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,920
- I thought you were broke.
- You said you were broke.

1406
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,860
- What?
- You said you were broke.

1407
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,430
I am broke, indeed.

1408
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,060
- What?
- I went all in.

1409
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,500
You said that last time too.

1410
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,600
I have no money left now.

1411
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,000
It's okay for me to tell them,
right?

1412
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,340
I bid 11 yeopjeons.

1413
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,610
Did you bid ten yeopjeons?

1414
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,340
(He bid 10 yeopjeons.)

1415
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,410
Did you?

1416
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,480
(Jong Min: 10 yeopjeons,
DinDin: 6 yeopjeons)

1417
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,050
Since I had 11 yeopjeons left,

1418
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,180
- I bid all of them.
- Hey.

1419
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,290
Let's move on.

1420
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,620
(Forget it. Let's move on.)

1421
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,750
Let's move on.

1422
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,720
- Inside the abalone...
- Oh, my.

1423
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,790
- What's in that?
- Some kind of beef meatball.

1424
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:51,830
Beef?

1425
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,930
- That looks amazing.
- This must be tasty.

1426
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,130
It must be really tasty.

1427
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,370
The abalone is very chewy and nice.

1428
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,310
And it feels like
the meatball is dancing with it.

1429
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,770
- It's so good.
- How does it dance?

1430
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:05,940
(Provoking)

1431
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,940
It dances blues and everything.

1432
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:10,780
He's enjoying the delicious dish,
so why do I feel sorry for him?

1433
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,250
- It's okay. This is good enough.
- Sae Ho got a good one.

1434
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,750
- No. It's protein too.
- My, it's so good.

1435
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,790
- He won't feel full.
- He won't feel full at all.

1436
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,320
- I should've bid more yeopjeons.
- I still have some left.

1437
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,860
That wasn't enough.

1438
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,260
- It's another hidden course.
- I won't bid for this.

1439
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,530
I fell for it earlier.

1440
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,730
- It's a hidden course again.
- It must be durian.

1441
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:28,860
I'm 100 percent sure.

1442
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,130
This dish is unusually refreshing,

1443
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,630
so it will freshen your breath.

1444
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:36,140
It is known as a popular dish
among epicures.

1445
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,370
For your information,
I like this dish too.

1446
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,440
At high-end sushi restaurants,

1447
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,910
they serve cold sashimi soup
for freshening breath.

1448
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:43,180
That means
the serving size is small.

1449
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:45,910
Protein shake was served earlier,
so it must be apple cider vinegar.

1450
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,550
It's very popular among epicures.

1451
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,390
Could it be sophora root tea?

1452
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:53,020
Epicures tend to enjoy dishes
served in small portions. Right?

1453
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,990
I want something like gukbap.

1454
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:56,020
Could it be sophora root tea?

1455
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,160
We'll reveal the hidden course.

1456
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,230
(Curious)

1457
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,700
(What kind of dish could be served
this time?)

1458
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,340
Oh, it's sushi.

1459
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,610
(The fifth dish:
Pickled radish sushi)

1460
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,980
(Actually, this sushi was...)

1461
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,510
(served for lunch earlier today.)

1462
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,780
The rice is not even seasoned.

1463
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,980
(It was made with cooked rice
that wasn't seasoned.)

1464
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:23,890
(It was made
with a half-hearted effort.)

1465
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:25,450
- It's sushi.
- The sushi we had earlier?

1466
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,160
- It's the sushi we had earlier.
- That's the worst.

1467
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,590
- It's what we had earlier.
- Who won the dish?

1468
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,160
(Who's the highest bidder
for this dish?)

1469
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,790
- Who could it be?
- It's for freshening your breath.

1470
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,260
Thank you.

1471
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,360
(Jong Min wins.)

1472
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,700
Jong Min.

1473
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,240
(Jong Min bid 8 yeopjeons.)

1474
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,840
(He was the only bidder.)

1475
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,440
(Jong Min starts eating
as he's hungry.)

1476
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,580
- Is it good?
- It makes you expect so much.

1477
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,610
Jong Min, how does it taste?
You wanted to eat it earlier.

1478
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,950
It feels like a penalty.

1479
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,450
Everyone,
this is the sixth dish already.

1480
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,550
(The number of yeopjeons
the members have left)

1481
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,150
(The sixth dish)

1482
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,490
- What is it?
- This is...

1483
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,420
- Is it tteokgalbi?
- Is it tteokgalbi?

1484
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:05,060
This is rosy sea bass
aged with kelp.

1485
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:07,660
- Rosy sea bass?
- It's charcoal-grilled.

1486
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,700
And the broth was made
with the bones of the fish.

1487
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,170
Please try it with the broth.

1488
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,170
This is driving me crazy.

1489
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,170
(The sixth dish:
Grilled rosy sea bass with rice)

1490
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,670
- It looks so good.
- This one looks amazing.

1491
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,110
This could be a hearty meal.

1492
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,310
It's not enough for a meal.

1493
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:22,840
- Is it rice under the fish?
- Yes, it's rice.

1494
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,080
- I need four times as much as this.
- So I should pour the broth...

1495
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,880
- and eat it with the fish?
- Yes, eat them together.

1496
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,280
If you want to bid for this dish,

1497
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,490
put yeopjeons on your tray.

1498
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,620
What should I do?
How much should I bid?

1499
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,720
(Jong Min puts yeopjeons on his tray
as soon as the bidding begins.)

1500
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,790
(He bids all 21 yeopjeons
he has left.)

1501
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,030
(In Round 3, he bid 12 yeopjeons,
but he failed to win.)

1502
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,830
(In Round 4, he bid 10 yeopjeons,
but he failed to win.)

1503
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,600
(In Round 5, where he won the bid
with 8 yeopjeons,)

1504
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:46,540
(he got to eat
pickled radish sushi.)

1505
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:50,870
(He had a piece of sushi
with 30 yeopjeons.)

1506
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,540
(I will eat it this time,
no matter what.)

1507
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:58,010
(Se Yoon and DinDin
are making their bids.)

1508
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,480
I wish there were some soup.

1509
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,450
- Five, four...
- I'm sorry about this.

1510
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,080
- Jong Min, did you bet everything?
- Three...

1511
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,790
Two, one.

1512
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,890
(Did Jong Min bet everything?)

1513
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,490
(Taking back)

1514
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,190
- Time is up.
- Great.

1515
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:12,890
Please!

1516
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,530
I have to eat this time.

1517
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,970
- There are two people...
- I guess it's very close.

1518
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:20,270
who made the same bids
at the highest price.

1519
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,070
- Okay!
- What do we do?

1520
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,770
(Feeling flustered)

1521
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:28,680
(Se Yoon also submitted
21 yeopjeons like Jong Min.)

1522
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,910
Please add more yeopjeons
if you want to increase the bid.

1523
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,050
- You aren't telling us who?
- No.

1524
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,390
(He has no more yeopjeon.)

1525
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,790
(Restless gaze)

1526
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,360
I'm sorry. May I borrow
some yeopjeons?

1527
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,360
I think I'm in big trouble.

1528
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,500
(He can sense
that he will go bankrupt.)

1529
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,770
(Se Yoon quietly adds
more yeopjeons.)

1530
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,570
Ma'am, please serve the food.

1531
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,410
I got it!

1532
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:01,440
(Se Yoon won the bid, of course.)

1533
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,240
I got it.

1534
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,910
(He just smiles.)

1535
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,050
Please give me an extra bowl
of instant rice.

1536
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,520
What are you going to do?

1537
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,290
What do you mean?
I'm done after having that sushi.

1538
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,350
(Being sensitive)

1539
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,590
(He clearly had 51 yeopjeons.)

1540
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,690
Goodness, that was the worst move.

1541
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:17,830
(I have none now.)

1542
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,160
Gosh, that looks delicious.

1543
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,600
(Se Yoon finally has
his first meal.)

1544
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,400
(This tastes like...)

1545
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,740
Try the rice.

1546
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,240
- Goodness.
- Try the rice.

1547
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,070
(Feeling ecstatic)

1548
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,470
This is what the chef said.

1549
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,380
"This is really delicious."

1550
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:38,650
(Even the chef recommended
the grilled rosy sea bass.)

1551
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,350
Oh, my goodness.
It tastes like some royal dish.

1552
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,790
This is so good.

1553
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,320
The soup is amazing.

1554
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,390
Who is out of the game?

1555
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:48,590
Who survived?

1556
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,330
DinDin is still in the game.
Se Yoon is almost out of yeopjeons.

1557
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,360
(The current number of yeopjeons)

1558
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,200
- I almost had it...
- Is this the seventh round?

1559
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,230
Right.

1560
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,770
Can I buy yeopjeons with my cash?

1561
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,800
(Now they have no choice
but to watch the others eat.)

1562
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,840
Can't I?

1563
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,470
- I want to buy them too.
- I know, right?

1564
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,970
(The next dish is coming in.)

1565
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:08,040
- Here we go again.
- It's a blind dish again.

1566
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,610
The hidden course is back.

1567
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,350
(The first hidden meal:
Protein shake)

1568
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,620
(The second hidden meal:
Pickled radish sushi)

1569
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,890
Can we not do the hidden course?

1570
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,720
It breaks my heart.

1571
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,490
The main ingredient
of this meal is...

1572
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:26,800
I think Sae Ho will love this.

1573
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,960
Me?

1574
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,960
What do you like?

1575
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,730
I really like all types of meat.

1576
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,070
(Meat?)

1577
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,870
(Joon wants to take part now.)

1578
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:43,950
(While all the course meals
were served,)

1579
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,450
(Joon did not open his wallet,
not even once.)

1580
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,950
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1581
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,250
- Joon, you have to go all in.
- Yes?

1582
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,220
This is the third hidden course.

1583
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,520
The first two were both weird.

1584
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,990
Everyone.

1585
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:57,990
(However...)

1586
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,790
- I'm going all in.
- All in.

1587
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,200
(Se Yoon says he'll go all in
without bidding any yeopjeon.)

1588
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:06,700
(He's acting like he has yeopjeons
when he has none.)

1589
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:08,740
(Seon Ho has the most yeopjeons
among them.)

1590
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,610
You have 30 seconds.

1591
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:13,310
(Boldly investing
in the hidden course)

1592
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:15,010
You have 30 seconds.

1593
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:18,010
This is driving me crazy.

1594
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:19,910
(Joon kept contemplating.)

1595
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,980
Five, four...

1596
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,250
(His first bid)

1597
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,420
(Adding a lot of yeopjeons)

1598
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,520
(Joon bid as many as 24 yeopjeons.)

1599
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,590
All right, everyone.

1600
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,860
We have a winner.

1601
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:34,900
I shouldn't have bid this time.

1602
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,360
This is driving me crazy.

1603
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,570
Ma'am, please reveal the dish.

1604
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,340
- Goodness.
- What is it?

1605
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,570
My gosh! What is that?

1606
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,170
What's that?

1607
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,040
(The hidden meal
surprised everyone.)

1608
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,550
- What is it?
- Is it a steak?

1609
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:52,610
(Here comes a steak.)

1610
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,480
- Is this a steak?
- It's a steak.

1611
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,480
Goodness.

1612
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,920
This is Korean beef tenderloin
cooked sous vide.

1613
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,090
- Below the meat is...
- It's warm.

1614
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,120
a sauce made with bell pepper.

1615
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,160
Oh, my.

1616
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,460
This is crazy.
I should have bid on this.

1617
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,100
This smells incredible. My gosh.

1618
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,200
I should've gone all in on this.

1619
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:12,770
It looks like a fancy dish.
I'm drooling.

1620
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,100
- A fancy dish.
- Please serve the dish.

1621
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,440
(Time to reveal the winner)

1622
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,140
- Is it DinDin?
- Whose dish is that?

1623
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,740
- Is it DinDin?
- Whose dish is that?

1624
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,310
- Is it DinDin?
- Okay!

1625
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:23,510
(Joon's first winning bid)

1626
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:24,710
We should have gone all in on this.

1627
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,980
I bid on the weird dish.

1628
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,450
(Nobody was expecting a lot
from this hidden meal.)

1629
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,720
It's worth the wait.

1630
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,790
- Goodness.
- Do you want me to cut it for you?

1631
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,190
- This? No, it's fine.
- Is it okay?

1632
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,560
I don't need carbs for this.

1633
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,760
This is a lot.

1634
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,360
Oh, wait a second.
This looks incredibly delicious.

1635
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,700
There are three big pieces of meat.

1636
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,800
You should have waited.
I waited so long for this.

1637
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,400
- You can take a big bite.
- Oh, my gosh.

1638
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,440
What's wrong?

1639
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,940
This is so good.

1640
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:51,910
Joon.

1641
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,680
The sauce is crazy good!

1642
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,940
This sauce is crazy.

1643
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,510
Can we get a bite after playing
rock-paper-scissors?

1644
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:57,510
- Sure.
- Okay.

1645
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,710
I'll join too.

1646
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:00,220
- What? What are you talking about?
- Ready or not,

1647
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,950
- rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1648
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:04,120
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I'm not giving you any meat.

1649
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:05,820
- Paper.
- I'm not playing this game.

1650
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,260
I won't give you any for real.

1651
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,520
I won.

1652
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,990
- I won.
- I'm not giving you any piece.

1653
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,530
I never agreed to this game.

1654
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:15,800
You will look kind
by giving me a piece.

1655
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,970
(A very novel reasoning)

1656
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,530
That's how you invest.

1657
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,340
Gosh, the meat is delicious.

1658
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,270
- Goodness.
- Is that pot rice?

1659
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:27,380
- What's going on?
- What's that?

1660
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,010
- What?
- Is it kimchi stew or what?

1661
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:31,010
Where did my money go? My money!

1662
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,980
- Is it eel? What is this?
- Where is all my money?

1663
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,020
What is this?

1664
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,650
My money!

1665
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:36,920
- We should bid on this.
- I mean...

1666
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,550
Where is my money? This is not mine.

1667
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,460
Someone stole my money.

1668
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,620
Please explain the dish for them.

1669
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,590
That's not what's important!
We have a thief in this room.

1670
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,360
I mean...

1671
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,030
- What?
- We have a thief in here.

1672
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,400
Let's hear her explanation first.

1673
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,100
- Her explanation? What about...
- Joon!

1674
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,400
Where are your manners?

1675
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,340
What do you mean? The thief
is the one with no manners.

1676
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,400
She's explaining.

1677
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,940
What's wrong with you?

1678
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:58,710
Why is everyone doing this?

1679
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:00,480
What's wrong with you?

1680
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,540
- What kind of dish is this?
- Why is everyone doing this?

1681
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,150
This is spicy beef tripe hot pot...

1682
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:07,020
made with savory intestines
and tripe...

1683
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,380
along with lean meat.

1684
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:10,290
I'm going all in on this.

1685
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,650
(Eighth dish: Beef tripe hot pot)

1686
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,220
Someone took Joon's money.

1687
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,060
We have a thief in here.

1688
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,390
Please give me back my money.
You're recorded on the camera.

1689
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,530
Can I have a bite?

1690
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,730
(The culprit is right next to him.)

1691
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,970
What is this?

1692
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:26,000
Did you take my money?

1693
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:29,600
(A few minutes ago)

1694
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:37,680
(Jong Min stole Joon's money
because he was too hungry.)

1695
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,050
I just need a bite.

1696
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:41,380
Why are you doing this?
Hold on a second.

1697
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,420
(I'll give your money back
if you give me a bite.)

1698
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,520
- Give me a bite.
- No.

1699
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,520
I'll give you a potato.

1700
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,620
- Come on! No.
- Take a potato.

1701
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,360
What do you mean?
You are the one who stole my money.

1702
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:54,200
Please submit your yeopjeons
if you want to bid.

1703
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,100
I'll give you one minute.

1704
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,600
(A very competitive bid
is expected this time.)

1705
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,600
I don't know how many yeopjeons
I should bid.

1706
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:02,300
- How many do you have?
- Ten.

1707
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:03,740
Me too.

1708
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,710
(They checked how much they have.)

1709
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,210
- Really?
- Submit your yeopjeons.

1710
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,780
We have to combine our yeopjeons.

1711
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,280
We don't have that many.

1712
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,810
(Se Yoon suggests making an ally.)

1713
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,420
(DinDin gives his yeopjeons
to Se Yoon.)

1714
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,850
I'll go big this time.

1715
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,860
We must go all in.

1716
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:23,730
The Korean beef tripe is delicious.

1717
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:24,730
The Korean beef from here is good.

1718
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:26,590
Right, the Korean beef from here
is good.

1719
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,800
Am I bidding too many? Hold on.

1720
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,770
Bring it on.
We're making a bold move.

1721
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:34,640
You know me, I love Korean food.
I'm bidding it all.

1722
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,040
Don't you mess with me. Seriously.

1723
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,610
(Se Yoon and DinDin
are likely to win.)

1724
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,270
I mean...

1725
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,380
I think I bid too many.

1726
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:45,180
Don't worry. We bid more than you.

1727
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,850
Everyone, we have a winner.

1728
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,750
I'm not even nervous.

1729
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:50,950
It has to be me this time.

1730
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:52,090
(Beef tripe hot pot that you
must try when you're in Uiryeong)

1731
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,790
(Who is going to have this dish?)

1732
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,690
(Feeling excited)

1733
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,560
There you go.

1734
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,500
(Seon Ho won.)

1735
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,770
- What?
- What?

1736
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,600
(What on earth happened?)

1737
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,340
You bid more than 20 yeopjeons?

1738
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,340
- No.
- How many did you bid?

1739
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,570
You're lying!
You bid 20 more than yeopjeons.

1740
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,240
- I didn't.
- How many did you bid?

1741
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:16,940
Hey!

1742
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:19,180
- What?
- You didn't bid, did you?

1743
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,680
You didn't bid my money, did you?

1744
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,220
- You didn't bid my money!
- Se Yoon tricked him.

1745
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:27,460
You didn't bid my money, did you?

1746
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,920
(5 minutes ago,
right before the bidding ended)

1747
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:33,090
(Se Yoon is removing the yeopjeons!)

1748
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:35,200
(Laughing)

1749
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,470
(Planning to take 20 for himself
while pretending to bid)

1750
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:40,940
This is why
you shouldn't partner up.

1751
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,270
This is what happens
when you make allies.

1752
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,310
This is crazy.

1753
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:45,540
(He almost lost his entire fortune.)

1754
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,910
Shall we ask Seon Ho
what it tastes like?

1755
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,210
- Yes.
- How does it taste, Seon Ho?

1756
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:50,950
This isn't just ordinary rice soup.

1757
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,550
This is a dish of its own.

1758
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:54,580
Really?

1759
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,550
It's really thick and...

1760
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:59,150
How can it be clean, thick,
and spicy?

1761
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,250
Should we play rock-paper-scissors?

1762
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,390
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1763
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:03,460
(Sae Ho wins alone
after playing rock!)

1764
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,460
I won! I won alone!

1765
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,700
Tell him to go out.

1766
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:09,400
(He probably ate more
from winning rock-paper-scissors.)

1767
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,070
Give me a spoonful
of rice with meat.

1768
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,670
Please bring in the next dish.

1769
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,370
Let's see the next dish.

1770
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,670
- What is it?
- What is it?

1771
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:18,810
It's pasta.

1772
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:20,810
This bisque pasta is made
using seasonal prawns,

1773
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:22,640
with the heads, shells,
and bodies...

1774
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,480
all incorporated into a single dish.

1775
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,720
- This is crazy.
- It's crazy.

1776
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,820
It's crazy.

1777
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,180
Everyone.

1778
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,290
(The bisque pasta bidding begins.)

1779
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:33,550
You may begin bidding.

1780
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:38,530
(A fierce battle of money
is expected.)

1781
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:42,200
We have a winner.

1782
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,370
If it goes to Joon, it'll be like
having an Outback meal for him.

1783
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:47,140
(Who will win the pasta?)

1784
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:50,170
- Goodness.
- Okay!

1785
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,610
- What a shame.
- Okay! Thank you.

1786
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,640
(Joon went all in
with 16 yeopjeons.)

1787
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,710
Joon ended it.

1788
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,880
- Okay!
- If he eats that,

1789
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,010
- he's done for the day.
- Of course.

1790
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,920
He had a Western meal.

1791
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,480
A Western course meal.

1792
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,250
(Inhaling like crazy)

1793
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,120
How is the food, Joon?

1794
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:09,390
I feel like I've become successful.

1795
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,390
(Waiting)

1796
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,860
I feel really thankful to myself...

1797
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,800
for having used
the yeopjeons so wisely.

1798
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:17,030
(Current number of yeopjeons)

1799
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,570
- Is it good?
- This is the taste of success.

1800
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,900
Joon, this is good, right?

1801
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:21,970
Next dish.

1802
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:22,970
(Only these three can participate
in the bid now.)

1803
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,670
- I haven't tried it.
- What is it?

1804
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:27,070
- What is it?
- It's getting smaller and smaller.

1805
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:28,640
What is it?

1806
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,010
What?

1807
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,280
(What is this?)

1808
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,620
This is the soul food
of 2 Days and 1 Night,

1809
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,280
uncooked ramyeon
and ramyeon seasoning.

1810
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,550
What are you talking about?

1811
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,620
This is just uncooked ramyeon.

1812
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,930
What are you doing?
Why would you do that?

1813
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:45,760
(She sprinkles it in a classy way.)

1814
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,090
What are you doing?

1815
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:48,500
Who made you do this?

1816
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,500
You don't need to do that.
Why would you do it?

1817
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,570
The pasta was the last decent dish.

1818
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:57,710
(She accomplishes her mission
and leaves awkwardly.)

1819
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,640
This meal...

1820
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,710
(The uncooked ramyeon
which wasn't popular...)

1821
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,880
had no bidder.

1822
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,880
- I'd have won if you lent me money.
- So I'll eat it.

1823
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:08,120
This is ridiculous.

1824
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,690
- Please bring it in.
- Let me just take a look.

1825
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,320
Is it hidden?

1826
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,390
(The hidden dish appears.)

1827
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,520
It's the hidden dish.

1828
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:16,290
I'm sure this is a durian.

1829
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:17,590
The timing is right for that.

1830
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:18,990
It's time.

1831
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,160
It's time for dessert.

1832
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:23,460
This course boasts
an overwhelming presentation...

1833
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:25,830
and a fiery flavor.

1834
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,840
It's a spicy dish.
Cheongyang chili pepper.

1835
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:31,440
You don't commonly see this
in ordinary restaurants.

1836
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,540
- It's durian.
- I think I normally tasted it...

1837
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,840
at overseas resorts.

1838
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,380
A fiery taste?

1839
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:39,110
I think it could be fine.

1840
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:40,550
The last three seconds.

1841
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,380
I'd go all in on that.

1842
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,120
I have a good feeling about it.

1843
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:47,890
(DinDin goes all in
with his entire fortune.)

1844
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,060
I'm a man.

1845
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:51,560
You know how I am, right?
I won't take it back.

1846
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,930
We have a winner.

1847
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,060
Everyone. The winner...

1848
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,000
- Please.
- is DinDin.

1849
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,230
Okay.

1850
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,140
I guessed it could be boiled crabs.

1851
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,110
This dish...

1852
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,170
It's Vietnamese chili.

1853
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,480
is a live fire show.

1854
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:10,440
- It's a good one.
- Fire show?

1855
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,380
(A live fire show?)

1856
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:15,920
This dish...

1857
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:20,250
(Overwhelming presentation
and fiery flavor)

1858
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:24,390
(The 11th dish: Live fire show)

1859
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:27,090
(Food isn't included
with the fire show experience.)

1860
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,300
(Holding in her laughter)

1861
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:30,630
Everyone except the winning bidder,

1862
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,570
please close your eyes.

1863
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,600
Why?

1864
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,100
We'll have DinDin come forward.

1865
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:40,470
What are you talking about?

1866
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:44,080
(He's laughing so hard.)

1867
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:45,510
There's food.

1868
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:46,910
You can eat that.

1869
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,450
Close your eyes!

1870
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,690
Everyone else
should close their eyes.

1871
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,390
- Gosh.
- Close your eyes!

1872
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:55,460
(I spent my entire fortune on this.)

1873
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,120
Close your eyes.

1874
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,460
(Laughing)

1875
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,500
I really want to watch.

1876
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,100
Fire!

1877
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:05,600
(Screaming)

1878
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,030
I'm so curious.

1879
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:10,470
(It is fascinating.)

1880
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,840
It's a bit short.

1881
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,910
It's a bit short, ma'am.

1882
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:16,910
(She does something more
because he said it was short.)

1883
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:18,510
What is this?

1884
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,710
Is that all?

1885
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:21,620
(Nodding)

1886
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,850
You can go back to your seat.

1887
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,690
- Is it over?
- You can go back.

1888
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:25,750
But I can eat this.

1889
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,560
- Is it over?
- Everyone!

1890
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,090
- This...
- What?

1891
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:30,930
is the 12th dish.

1892
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:32,590
What is that?

1893
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,530
- The fire show was the 11th?
- Yes.

1894
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:36,330
What is this?

1895
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,300
This is called rum baba.

1896
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,000
I topped the fermented cake...

1897
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,940
with orange mousse.

1898
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,370
(That looks tasty.)

1899
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:46,210
This is a high-end French dessert.

1900
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,740
- I know.
- Rum baba.

1901
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,380
Se Yoon is surviving
longer than I thought.

1902
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,580
Is he just making moves
when he doesn't have yeopjeons?

1903
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,080
(He makes a bid right away.)

1904
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,650
This is ridiculous.

1905
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:58,920
(He goes all in
with the remaining 10 yeopjeons.)

1906
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:02,160
(Se Yoon gives it a thought...)

1907
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,490
(and bids only 1 yeopjeon.)

1908
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:08,400
I said there are 13 dishes
in this course meal.

1909
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,300
This is the 12th dish.

1910
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:13,870
Seon Ho!

1911
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:16,040
(Feeling disappointed)

1912
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,240
As soon as it was put down...

1913
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,940
That means
the last dish is for Se Yoon.

1914
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:20,940
Why does he look so disappointed?

1915
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,110
I'll move on to the next dish.

1916
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:24,850
How many yeopjeons does he have?

1917
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:27,310
Bring in the last dish.

1918
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,780
- Is the last one a hidden dish?
- A hidden dish.

1919
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:32,390
It's big.

1920
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,190
Good! That's the one!

1921
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:37,020
- Hold on.
- Durian!

1922
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,560
All right.

1923
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,330
(The durian's smell
hits powerfully.)

1924
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,760
This is the last hidden dish.

1925
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,330
You have to go all in
with all the yeopjeons you have.

1926
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:48,440
(He has to buy it
even if he doesn't want to.)

1927
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,470
(Let's go, durian.)

1928
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:53,340
The long-awaited last dish.

1929
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,480
It's a good one. Move forward.

1930
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,280
Ma'am. I don't think
you made this dish.

1931
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,850
(He's not excited at all.)

1932
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,550
Everyone.

1933
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,290
It's the last dish.

1934
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,290
It's warm. What?

1935
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,090
(It can't be a durian, then.)

1936
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:13,930
- Se Yoon!
- Gosh!

1937
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,600
(Amazed)

1938
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:19,270
(It's rice and meat.)

1939
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:23,000
(He's touched.)

1940
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,370
This is crazy.

1941
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:26,310
(The last dish
with an amazing visual appears.)

1942
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:29,680
This is a local specialty
from Garye-myeon, Uiryeong-gun.

1943
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,710
It's charcoal-grilled pork.

1944
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:33,280
(The 13th and last dish:
Charcoal-grilled pork)

1945
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:35,750
Please explain these too.

1946
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,590
These are wrap vegetables,

1947
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:39,090
and these are vegetables
cut into stick shapes.

1948
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:40,520
You can eat them in a wrap.

1949
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,490
I'll eat it first.

1950
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:45,390
I didn't expect this kind of twist.

1951
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:47,960
(He puts the bulgogi in a wrap.)

1952
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,700
Do a water show next time.

1953
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,000
Se Yoon's strategy was nice.

1954
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,330
(Eating it at once)

1955
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,670
Se Yoon had nine yeopjeons
at the end.

1956
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:57,440
- It's so good.
- How is it?

1957
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:59,910
The fiery flavor swirls in my mouth.

1958
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:01,180
It's so nice.

1959
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,380
This is crazy.

1960
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:05,510
Hold on.

1961
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:08,580
It's midnight now,
and we just had dinner.

1962
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,120
Really?

1963
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,820
We had dinner for three hours today.

1964
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,690
- But you know...
- We're almost French.

1965
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:18,260
French course meals
are served for over four hours.

1966
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:20,060
- It's classy here.
- Right.

1967
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,400
We're eating dinner for three hours.

1968
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,760
I didn't notice the time passing.

1969
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:26,470
(After a fancy dinner,)

1970
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:27,740
(the members return
to the accommodation.)

1971
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:30,240
Everyone. Gather here.

1972
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:32,210
Are we doing something?

1973
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,510
(But...)

1974
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:35,840
- The room is clean.
- Right.

1975
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:39,050
(All the windows have been covered.)

1976
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,180
They covered them.

1977
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:41,680
- They covered them.
- All right.

1978
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,380
I'll quickly explain.

1979
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:44,950
- Okay.
- I told you Uiryeong...

1980
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:47,250
is famous for its ogre tales.

1981
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:48,460
- Yes.
- That's right.

1982
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,190
- Soemogi from earlier.
- Yes.

1983
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:53,590
Today's Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors
is related to that.

1984
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,860
Goblin's Magical and Unpredictable Club.

1985
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,100
That sounds fun.

1986
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,930
You don't know where
it's going to come flying from.

1987
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,770
We'll divide the six of you...

1988
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,400
into groups of three.

1989
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,270
Three of you will stand
in front of the wall.

1990
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:10,210
Then, I'll count to three...

1991
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,950
and throw the club.

1992
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:14,080
- We'll catch the club.
- You'll catch the club.

1993
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,380
When the lights suddenly go out,

1994
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,890
you can hit another member.

1995
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,390
- You can hit others.
- But...

1996
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:23,190
- But?
- you can only move...

1997
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:26,190
when the lights are out.

1998
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:28,000
When the lights are on,

1999
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,160
no one is allowed to move.

2000
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,730
You can only move
when the lights are out.

2001
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:34,070
Even if you catch the ogre's club,

2002
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:35,740
- you stop when the lights are on.
- Yes.

2003
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:36,940
- Everyone should stop.
- You'd be able to see...

2004
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:38,170
the person who caught the club.

2005
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:40,510
The moment that person hits someone,

2006
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:42,540
that round ends.

2007
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:43,980
The person who gets hit
by the club...

2008
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,250
will be sleeping outdoors.

2009
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,310
That's going to end quickly.

2010
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:47,480
- What?
- This is how it goes.

2011
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,880
There will be 1 person
from Group 1's match.

2012
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:52,450
There will be 1 person
from Group 2's match.

2013
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:54,920
- Four people survived, right?
- Yes.

2014
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,930
On the last round,
the four survivors will play,

2015
01:10:57,930 --> 01:10:59,230
- One person gets eliminated.
- and one person will be eliminated.

2016
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:00,530
There will be one more person
who will sleep outdoors.

2017
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,460
So there will be three people
sleeping outdoors.

2018
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,530
Okay.

2019
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:05,170
You'd know who got hit, right?

2020
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:06,730
- We would know.
- Right.

2021
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:09,340
- The camera.
- We can check through the camera.

2022
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,840
The person with the ogre's club...

2023
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,280
- might move when the lights are on.
- Yes.

2024
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:18,450
In that case, the person
has to drop the club there,

2025
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,510
and he can't grab it again.

2026
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:21,620
All right.

2027
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,480
- What do we do?
- How would you like to form groups?

2028
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,550
Play rock or scissors.

2029
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:26,020
- Play rock or scissors.
- Split up with rock or scissors.

2030
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,760
- Rock or scissors.
- Rock or scissors!

2031
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:29,190
(Rock, scissors, rock)

2032
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:30,490
(Scissors, scissors, rock)

2033
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:31,860
- We're split like this.
- It's done.

2034
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,190
- Like this.
- This is bad.

2035
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:36,100
What if the head falls off...

2036
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:37,600
after hitting with the club?

2037
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,400
Should I stick it back on?

2038
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,770
- Stick it back on.
- Stitch it back on for me.

2039
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:44,040
- Stitch it back on?
- All right then.

2040
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:45,070
We'll start with
the lightweight division.

2041
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,140
The lightweight division.

2042
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:48,610
All right, everyone. We'll begin.
It'll end in a flash.

2043
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,240
All right.

2044
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,710
Don't come this way.

2045
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:52,750
Okay. We can see them.

2046
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,110
- Jong Min.
- We can see them.

2047
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,180
- We can see them with this.
- Just a moment.

2048
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:59,090
- One, two, three.
- You shouldn't move.

2049
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:00,120
Go!

2050
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,760
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2051
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,330
(Staggering)

2052
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:06,790
Leave it on the floor.

2053
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:09,730
- Leave it on the floor and move.
- No. He should stay just like that.

2054
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:11,170
- He can't move.
- Right.

2055
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:12,270
All right.

2056
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:15,540
Gosh, that's how it's done?

2057
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,640
What?

2058
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:23,140
(The club is in DinDin's hand!)

2059
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,810
(Let's see.)

2060
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:29,150
- I can't see anything.
- Hey, be careful.

2061
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,720
(The target is either one of them!)

2062
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:35,990
I can't see anything.

2063
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,360
This is making me feel so nervous.

2064
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:41,960
(Scared)

2065
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:45,800
(Ogre DinDin looks relaxed.)

2066
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,670
What?

2067
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:56,340
(Sae Ho is grabbed by Seon Ho?)

2068
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:00,510
What?

2069
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:03,550
(Grabbing)

2070
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:06,890
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

2071
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,920
- Hurry up!
- Ogre DinDin is moving.

2072
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:09,960
(Groaning)

2073
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:12,390
DinDin.

2074
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,660
(DinDin hit someone?)

2075
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,800
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

2076
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,000
Hurry up!

2077
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,100
(Seon Ho moves away from Sae Ho!)

2078
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:21,070
(Hitting and groaning)

2079
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:24,440
- DinDin!
- All right. Seon Ho...

2080
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:26,140
will sleep outdoors.

2081
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,210
The players of the second group...

2082
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,680
- will now enter.
- Okay.

2083
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:31,350
- But this is hard.
- It's scary.

2084
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:33,310
I want to move
after picking up the club,

2085
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:34,880
but I can't move as I don't know
when the lights will be on.

2086
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,050
Right. Keep the lights off
for a longer period of time.

2087
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:40,790
(But...)

2088
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,760
(Sae Ho looks anxious!)

2089
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,230
- That was fun.
- Did you see us?

2090
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,990
All right.
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2091
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:48,860
When the second group plays,

2092
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:50,630
- could I use the restroom?
- Of course.

2093
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:52,030
- Thank you.
- Is it a number two?

2094
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:55,270
Well, no comment.

2095
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,310
So they're seen like this.

2096
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:01,310
- All right. It's the second group.
- Joon.

2097
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:04,010
- Let's not get hurt.
- Right. Let's not get hurt.

2098
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:05,180
All right.

2099
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:07,680
One, two...

2100
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,580
Go!

2101
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:13,950
(DinDin's camera)

2102
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,190
(The club goes to Joon.)

2103
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:16,490
It's over.

2104
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:19,790
(Heart pounding)

2105
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:23,630
(DinDin's camera)

2106
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,300
It feels scarier to move
when you have the club.

2107
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,000
We can see them through this.

2108
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:40,510
I think a target is set.

2109
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:43,220
I think a target is set.

2110
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:48,620
(Ogre Joon...)

2111
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:51,060
(can only see one!)

2112
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,160
(Screaming)

2113
01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:01,070
(Screaming)

2114
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,640
Why me?

2115
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:08,010
- Joon is good at this.
- Go for him.

2116
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:09,180
Go for him! You can do it!

2117
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:10,640
(DinDin's camera)

2118
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:15,420
(Ogre Joon stays focused.)

2119
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:16,750
You never know what will happen.

2120
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,350
(Moving)

2121
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:23,190
- It's the Ninja Assassin!
- He's the Ninja Assassin.

2122
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:26,660
(Everyone is focused
in the intense situation.)

2123
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,030
The target is back.

2124
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:29,530
(Everyone is focused
in the intense situation.)

2125
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,870
- What?
- Hold on!

2126
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:34,230
- I'm sorry.
- Gosh!

2127
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:36,240
- What?
- I'm so sorry.

2128
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,940
- Gosh, Sae Ho!
- What was that?

2129
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,270
Why bother us
after emptying yourself?

2130
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:40,910
Things were intense just now!

2131
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:42,610
- My stomach hurt so much.
- Gosh!

2132
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,950
- What is this smell?
- Stop lying!

2133
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,610
- Let's start.
- Here we go.

2134
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,990
It's hard to move now.

2135
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:57,120
It's hard to move
when you have the club.

2136
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,630
Look behind you!

2137
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,260
(Change of target)

2138
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:06,400
(DinDin's camera)

2139
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,570
(Se Yoon is suddenly cornered.)

2140
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:12,340
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, my gosh!

2141
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:20,310
(Is he dead?)

2142
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,350
(Se Yoon had nowhere to go.)

2143
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:29,560
(Very entertained)

2144
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,890
(The target is on the ground.)

2145
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:33,590
I bumped into the TV
earlier as well.

2146
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:34,900
- You have to watch out for the TV.
- Right.

2147
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,260
(Holding his laughter)

2148
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:37,460
(He's holding his laughter
and breath.)

2149
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,130
Oh, my gosh! Goodbye!

2150
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:40,470
Just beat him down!

2151
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:41,970
Goodbye!

2152
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:45,270
Just beat him down, Joon!

2153
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:47,810
I'm hurt, Joon.

2154
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,710
I'm hurt, Joon.

2155
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:52,850
Take a break for 30 seconds.

2156
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:53,950
- Are you okay?
- Just a moment.

2157
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:55,820
- I'm okay.
- What is this?

2158
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,420
Let's just move the TV back.

2159
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,120
- Just move the TV back.
- I'll do it.

2160
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,290
- You're okay now, right, Se Yoon?
- Yes.

2161
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:02,290
(The game resumes.)

2162
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:07,490
(He survived!)

2163
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:14,170
Go for him, Joon!

2164
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,170
Gosh, this is so intense.

2165
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:20,940
- This is so exciting.
- Gosh!

2166
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:24,240
How did you get me?

2167
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,450
(Jong Min is grabbed?)

2168
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:27,710
Go for him, Joon!

2169
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:32,620
(Jong Min got caught
by the tips of Se Yoon's hands.)

2170
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:35,390
Gosh!

2171
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:37,820
How did you get me?

2172
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,230
You're good at seeing in the dark.

2173
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,300
(Offered as a sacrifice)

2174
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:49,840
All right.

2175
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,570
Kim Jong Min will sleep outdoors.

2176
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:55,380
- Gosh, that was so annoying.
- Is it over?

2177
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,640
(They survive to
the 3rd round with tears.)

2178
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,180
It wasn't me? Did you get him?

2179
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,480
Nice one.

2180
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:02,850
- My gosh!
- Why did you do that, Jong Min?

2181
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,650
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2182
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:06,620
How did he get me?

2183
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,460
I've been sleeping with Jong Min
for almost two months now.

2184
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:12,390
It's the four of us, right?

2185
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:13,890
One out of four.

2186
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:17,360
This is the final deciding round
for the one to sleep outdoors.

2187
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,600
Stay on the wall.

2188
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:22,140
The ones who had the club
all won, right?

2189
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,300
Could you throw the club
when the lights are off?

2190
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,670
- Should we do that?
- I think that will be better.

2191
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:28,780
- Okay.
- With the lights off.

2192
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:30,740
Throw it at any time
with the lights off.

2193
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:33,380
All right. I will throw it
when the lights are off.

2194
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,580
Please turn off the lights.

2195
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,520
Are you not going to watch?

2196
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:39,390
(The Ninja Assassin
aggressively moves forward.)

2197
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,390
(He retreats after sensing danger.)

2198
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,520
All right.

2199
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:45,630
Go!

2200
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,400
Gosh, Se Yoon has it.

2201
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,970
He just moved his head!

2202
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:54,300
This was just to put on a show.

2203
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,440
Se Yoon has it.

2204
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,300
Go for the head.

2205
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:03,340
- He looks just like an ogre.
- He looks so scary.

2206
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,410
Stop moving this way.

2207
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:07,350
- Don't come here!
- Stop moving this way.

2208
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:09,580
- Don't come here, Joon!
- He's so scary!

2209
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:12,950
- Don't come here, Joon!
- He's so scary!

2210
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,220
Don't come here! Move away!

2211
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,860
Gosh, he really looks like an ogre.

2212
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,700
(The Ogre Pig is coming!)

2213
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,630
It's him!

2214
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:29,270
Gosh, DinDin is stuck.

2215
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:30,300
DinDin.

2216
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,370
Gosh, DinDin is stuck.

2217
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,040
(Save me.)

2218
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:44,420
Wasn't that the sound
of someone getting hit?

2219
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:45,950
It was the TV.

2220
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:47,790
(Stomping)

2221
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:48,960
Gosh, that's so scary!

2222
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:50,820
Cho Sae Ho!

2223
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,390
(I'm about to throw up out of fear.)

2224
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:53,890
Cho Sae Ho!

2225
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:57,830
He did well to get away.

2226
01:19:58,130 --> 01:19:59,170
Cho Sae Ho!

2227
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:00,800
He didn't do well to get away.

2228
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,100
- Get him!
- Get Sae Ho!

2229
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,600
Finish him!

2230
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,700
(Stomping)

2231
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:08,340
You moved, Se Yoon.
That's a warning.

2232
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,810
That much is fine.

2233
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,110
Cho Sae Ho!

2234
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,680
- Why are you being like that?
- He's so scary.

2235
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,120
He changed direction.

2236
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,320
Why are you being like that?

2237
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:21,820
You can't move further back
from there.

2238
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:23,890
- Go away, DinDin!
- What?

2239
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,860
DinDin got hit.

2240
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:27,730
- DinDin!
- DinDin!

2241
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,100
You can't move further back
from there.

2242
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,800
(Hitting)

2243
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,830
What?

2244
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,300
DinDin got hit.

2245
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,200
- DinDin!
- DinDin!

2246
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,140
He's the last one...

2247
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:40,070
- who will be sleeping outdoors.
- I'm an ogre!

2248
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:41,740
(DinDin will sleep outdoors.)

2249
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:44,080
I got DinDin!

2250
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:48,950
(But...)

2251
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:52,390
(Sae Ho isn't able to smile.)

2252
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:55,020
- All right, everyone.
- That was nerve-racking.

2253
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,290
But...

2254
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:59,090
(Laughing)

2255
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,000
- What's wrong?
- I must sleep outdoors.

2256
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,130
Why?

2257
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:04,930
I'll wrap it up quickly.

2258
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:05,970
Okay.

2259
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,770
- Last time,
- Thank you.

2260
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:09,440
when I went through surgery,
DinDin slept outdoors...

2261
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,570
- That's right.
- instead of me.

2262
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:15,780
(Sae Ho went through surgery
for lymphadenitis.)

2263
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:17,310
(I'll sleep outdoors
for the next game.)

2264
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:19,350
(The person to sleep outdoors
instead of him was chosen.)

2265
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:20,810
(Peeking with half-closed eyes)

2266
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:22,720
(The person to sleep outdoors
instead of him was chosen.)

2267
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:26,890
(DinDin got to sleep outdoors.)

2268
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,860
(DinDin slept outdoors
in Sae Ho's stead...)

2269
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:32,330
(after Sae Ho promised
that he'd sleep outdoors next time.)

2270
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:33,990
- I'll sleep outdoors tonight.
- Thank you.

2271
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:35,630
- Thank you.
- So, that's how it turns out?

2272
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:37,760
- We call it even now. Thank you.
- It's even now.

2273
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,300
So, he's sleeping outdoors.
That's good.

2274
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,900
It should've been Joon.

2275
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:43,500
- Everyone.
- He's fast. He's a ninja.

2276
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:46,970
All right. Jong Min, Seon Ho,

2277
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,940
- and Sae Ho instead of DinDin.
- Okay.

2278
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:52,650
These three will sleep outdoors.

2279
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:53,850
All right.

2280
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:56,350
- Thank you.
- It should've been Joon.

2281
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:59,890
(Just you wait, Moon Se Yoon.)

2282
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:02,860
(Meanwhile)

2283
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,320
It's 12:30 a.m.?

2284
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,790
(Director Joo keeps checking
the current time.)

2285
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:07,560
All right, everyone.

2286
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,700
My gosh. It's...

2287
01:22:10,730 --> 01:22:12,700
- already 12:30 a.m.
- My gosh.

2288
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:14,070
- It ended early though.
- Yes.

2289
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:16,070
Thank you for your hard work.

2290
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:18,070
There will be
no wake-up song tomorrow.

2291
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:19,710
- You can sleep all you want.
- Really?

2292
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:20,810
Are you going to run away?

2293
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,310
Goodnight.

2294
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:23,980
Is it okay to sleep in?

2295
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,280
Should we wake up
when we're told to?

2296
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,380
You can just sleep all you want.

2297
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,010
- Really?
- Is someone going to wake us up?

2298
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,420
- Well...
- Can we sleep all day?

2299
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:31,690
That can't be it.

2300
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:33,190
You're right.

2301
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:34,750
You can't sleep outdoors all day.

2302
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:36,220
Thank you all for today.

2303
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2304
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:39,730
Good work.

2305
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:41,190
- Thank you.
- All right.

2306
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,000
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

2307
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,200
(They don't know what's going on,
but they just get ready for bed.)

2308
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:47,370
(Team Sleep Indoors
gets ready for bed.)

2309
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,240
It's strange that
there will be no wake-up song.

2310
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,440
Are they going to run away?

2311
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,810
I bet they will disappear.

2312
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:56,010
"Come and catch us."

2313
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:57,010
(They think the mission is
to find the production crew.)

2314
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:59,010
It's so cool here.
It's humid outside.

2315
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:01,510
It's not just humid.

2316
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:03,380
There are a lot of bugs.

2317
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:08,390
(The base camp is in the forest,
so there are a lot of bugs.)

2318
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:09,960
(Team Sleep Outdoors
is out to sleep.)

2319
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,020
My goodness.

2320
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:12,690
What's this?

2321
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:14,760
Go away.

2322
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,600
(As expected, bugs are
crawling all over the tent.)

2323
01:23:17,730 --> 01:23:19,070
There's a hole.

2324
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:20,400
(To make matters worse,
the tent has a hole.)

2325
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:22,100
I'm going in.

2326
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:23,370
(They quickly enter the tent
so the bugs can't get into it.)

2327
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:25,710
- You should bring your shoes in.
- Your shoes.

2328
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:26,770
(They quickly enter the tent
so the bugs can't get into it.)

2329
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:28,380
What do we do?

2330
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,510
This way, they won't get in
for the time being.

2331
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,620
Then they wouldn't get in.

2332
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:38,080
(They use mosquito repellent
as a temporary measure.)

2333
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:39,720
Do you see that, Jong Min?

2334
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,650
(They rest at ease,
relying on the mosquito repellent.)

2335
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:45,260
(Now they try to sleep.)

2336
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,230
- Darn it!
- Hurry.

2337
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:50,000
(What is this sound?)

2338
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,170
- Is the situation interesting?
- It sounds fun.

2339
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:53,670
(We can't miss out on the fun.)

2340
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:56,370
- What is going on?
- I feel bad for them.

2341
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:58,610
What's wrong?

2342
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:01,310
- Give me some tissues.
- What is it?

2343
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,840
There are too many bugs.

2344
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:03,840
Gosh, Seon Ho.

2345
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,210
- I'm sorry.
- Even when it's closed?

2346
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:08,050
(The whole story)

2347
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:10,350
I'll go to the restroom.

2348
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:11,450
No.

2349
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,790
I have to brush my teeth.

2350
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:17,620
(Seon Ho suddenly insists
on going to the restroom.)

2351
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,860
Once you open the tent,
the bugs will fly in right away.

2352
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:21,760
Make sure to close it well.

2353
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:25,030
(They told him to get out carefully,
but he makes a big fuss.)

2354
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:26,130
You opened it too much.

2355
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,370
- Later...
- It's coming in.

2356
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,500
- Darn it. My gosh.
- Why?

2357
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:31,770
(A bug entered the tent.)

2358
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:33,570
- It went in.
- Darn it!

2359
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:34,640
Hurry.

2360
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:37,840
(That's how everyone got up.)

2361
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,150
Gosh, Seon Ho.

2362
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:40,250
- I'm sorry.
- Even when it's closed?

2363
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:42,620
You should sleep outside the tent.

2364
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,580
Why are you being like that?

2365
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:49,360
(Jong Min managed to catch the bug.)

2366
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,660
(And Seon Ho quickly got in.)

2367
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:51,860
Hurry and close it.

2368
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:57,460
(Then they finally went to sleep.)

2369
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:02,700
(The darkness lifts.)

2370
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:07,940
(The day has dawned.)

2371
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:13,050
(A quiet morning
with no wake-up song)

2372
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:15,450
(It's 7:10 a.m. now.)

2373
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,720
(A text message
is sent to everyone.)

2374
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:26,260
(Anyone who is awake now,
please come outside quietly.)

2375
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:29,300
(Se Yoon reacts to the message?)

2376
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:35,200
(He just sleeps.)

2377
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:38,870
(At that moment,
Sae Ho is tossing and turning.)

2378
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,580
(He just sleeps too.)

2379
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,210
(Anyone who is awake now,
please come outside quietly.)

2380
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:47,180
(No one reads the message.)

2381
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,320
Did they turn off
the text notifications?

2382
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,990
It's the group chat room,
so they probably turned it off.

2383
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:54,190
(What makes Director Joo nervous...)

2384
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:57,120
(is today's hidden morning mission.)

2385
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:02,700
(It started
before they went to sleep.)

2386
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:05,330
(My gosh. It's...)

2387
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:06,970
(already 12:30 a.m.)

2388
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,700
(He awkwardly emphasized
the time they would go to bed.)

2389
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:14,210
(No one noticed it,)

2390
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,610
(but there was one
of the Habits of the Wealthy.)

2391
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:22,720
(The wealthy get
at least 7 hours of sleep.)

2392
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:25,080
(They went to bed at 12:30 a.m.)

2393
01:26:31,090 --> 01:26:33,290
(They have to sleep until 7:30 a.m.
to succeed in the mission.)

2394
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:38,030
(If they succeed,
they get to eat beef gukbap.)

2395
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:44,840
(If they fail, they have to go
hiking to Mount Hanwoo.)

2396
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:48,340
(That means he is luring
the members into going hiking now.)

2397
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:53,410
(It is 7:20 a.m. now.)

2398
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,980
(He urgently sends the 2nd message.)

2399
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:59,220
(Anyone who is awake now,
please come outside quietly.)

2400
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:01,390
(Anyone who is awake now,
please come outside quietly.)

2401
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:05,330
(DinDin checks the message?)

2402
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:07,690
(He didn't.)

2403
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:09,660
(Se Yoon?)

2404
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:11,530
(He sleeps well.)

2405
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,030
(He sends the 3rd message.)

2406
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,900
(He walks around
right in front of them.)

2407
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:19,270
(Silent)

2408
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:20,370
(No one came out.)

2409
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:21,910
Let's go wake them up.

2410
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:25,240
Everyone, wake up.

2411
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,380
Everyone.

2412
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:30,020
You succeeded in the mission.

2413
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,780
- What?
- What mission?

2414
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,720
- Did we do something?
- Yes.

2415
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:37,020
- What mission?
- What did we do?

2416
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:38,630
- What?
- We did?

2417
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:40,130
(Those outside are flustered too.)

2418
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:41,860
- What mission?
- We didn't do anything.

2419
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,100
You successfully followed
the Habits of the Wealthy.

2420
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,130
So you succeeded in the mission.

2421
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:48,970
What? The Habits of the Wealthy?

2422
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:50,270
We slept for over seven hours?

2423
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:51,700
(The wealthy get
at least 7 hours of sleep.)

2424
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,340
I don't think I slept much.

2425
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:55,410
What would we do if we failed?

2426
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,510
If you failed...

2427
01:27:58,110 --> 01:27:59,810
There's Mount Hanwoo near here.

2428
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:02,620
- Goodness.
- You'd have to go hiking.

2429
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:04,420
Gosh, that's the worst.

2430
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:06,520
- It could've been terrible.
- My goodness.

2431
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,320
It says, "Anyone who is awake now,
please come outside quietly."

2432
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:10,890
It feels like I should go quietly
without saying anything...

2433
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:13,290
to get some benefit.

2434
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,230
Let's go eat beef gukbap.

2435
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:18,300
Let's go.

2436
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:21,400
Let's just eat beef gukbap.

2437
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,800
(Congratulations
on completing the mission.)

2438
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,740
(Meanwhile)

2439
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:27,540
When are they coming?

2440
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:28,680
(The cameraman
at the top of Mount Hanwoo)

2441
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:32,380
None of the members got up.

2442
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:33,450
(The production crew who went up
the mountain is coming down.)

2443
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:38,250
(Please enjoy the scenery
they captured diligently.)

2444
01:28:53,730 --> 01:28:55,970
Let's get off. Let's eat.

2445
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:58,140
- What's that?
- Why?

2446
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:59,510
So, this is it.

2447
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:01,770
- This is open.
- My goodness.

2448
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:02,980
What's this?

2449
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:04,480
(The older members go closer,
as if entranced.)

2450
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:06,010
(Beef gukbap)

2451
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:07,950
- That's a lot of green onions.
- It looks great.

2452
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:09,050
This is crazy.

2453
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:11,120
- This looks really good.
- This is what I like.

2454
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:12,750
Hello.

2455
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:14,920
What? Hang on.

2456
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,890
I've been here before.

2457
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:18,160
Really? How?

2458
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,290
I came here
for "Wednesday Foodtalk."

2459
01:29:20,590 --> 01:29:22,060
I came here before.

2460
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:23,400
Seriously?

2461
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:27,130
(DinDin came here
and had beef gukbap 9 years ago.)

2462
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,000
This place is really good.

2463
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,040
- You came here to eat this?
- Yes. I came all the way here.

2464
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:33,410
- Really?
- This is crazy.

2465
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,640
- It must be delicious.
- They use a caldron.

2466
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:39,180
As I told you earlier,
beef gukbap is...

2467
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:40,650
- It's a signature dish.
- one of Uiryeong's...

2468
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:42,620
- famous local dishes.
- Okay.

2469
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:45,220
This place opened
shortly after liberation.

2470
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:47,120
It is a 70-year-old restaurant.

2471
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:48,760
After liberation?

2472
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,460
It's been 75 years.

2473
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,790
- This is crazy.
- It's really...

2474
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:54,090
They're scooping.

2475
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:55,630
They are scooping the soup.

2476
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,630
They do that. I saw it.

2477
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:59,200
It looks amazing.

2478
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,330
I'm so hungry.

2479
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:04,900
(The spicy soup
that moistens white rice)

2480
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,440
It's fun to watch it from here.

2481
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,080
- It's coming.
- Hello.

2482
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

2483
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:12,180
Your food is here.

2484
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:14,050
We will enjoy the food.

2485
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:15,520
- Thank you.
- This is amazing.

2486
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,680
(What does Uiryeong's delicacy
taste like?)

2487
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:18,750
(Slurping)

2488
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:20,890
This is the taste.

2489
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,890
(He's deeply touched
by the nostalgic taste.)

2490
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:25,730
- My gosh.
- Awesome.

2491
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:27,530
Unbelievable.

2492
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,100
(Exclaiming)

2493
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,270
It's incredibly savory.

2494
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:34,830
As soon as I try it,

2495
01:30:34,830 --> 01:30:37,240
the savory taste
spreads on my tongue.

2496
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,940
- It's really good.
- It's good, right?

2497
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:40,770
- My gosh.
- Awesome.

2498
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,680
It's really good.

2499
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,450
(The radish and bean sprouts
create a nice, refreshing taste.)

2500
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:48,950
- It's so refreshing.
- The savory taste...

2501
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:52,420
(Exclaiming)

2502
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:55,520
This is the best gukbap
I've ever had.

2503
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,260
- Seriously?
- This is the best.

2504
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:59,260
It's not too spicy.

2505
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:02,200
- It's not too strong.
- It's so smooth.

2506
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:05,000
But it's very addictive.
I can't stop eating it.

2507
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:09,370
(Gobbling up)

2508
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,740
(It looks like
they've starved for days.)

2509
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,870
This is so good.

2510
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:15,940
(The members are captivated
by the charm of beef gukbap.)

2511
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:17,010
It's so tasty.

2512
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,680
I really like it.

2513
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:21,850
(Clean)

2514
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:23,020
It's that good.

2515
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:24,920
Give me one more bowl.

2516
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:27,890
- It's for Se Yoon.
- You polished it off again.

2517
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:29,060
- Yes.
- Not again.

2518
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:31,360
Se Yoon's starting over again.

2519
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,160
(He eats as if it's his first meal.)

2520
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:41,000
You ate it all?

2521
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,970
DinDin ate it all. This is a first.

2522
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,240
Even the broth.

2523
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:46,940
It tasted nostalgic.

2524
01:31:47,170 --> 01:31:48,440
It's really good.

2525
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,340
You need to eat before you go.

2526
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:55,150
(We spent 2 days...)

2527
01:31:55,150 --> 01:32:01,550
(and 1 night in Uiryeong.)

2528
01:32:01,890 --> 01:32:03,690
How did you like the two days...

2529
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:05,630
we spent in the village
of the wealthy?

2530
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:07,530
- It was great.
- I loved it.

2531
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:09,230
- It was much better than expected.
- Yes.

2532
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:12,400
We went round the whole place
and the energy...

2533
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:15,230
made me feel living here
would make you rich.

2534
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:17,100
- Yes.
- That's how I felt.

2535
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,210
- Right?
- I don't believe that stuff,

2536
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:20,770
- but I felt it.
- Right?

2537
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:22,410
The good energy
helped me sleep well.

2538
01:32:22,410 --> 01:32:24,040
- Yes.
- I felt great.

2539
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:27,380
We rarely sleep this well
while filming this show.

2540
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:29,120
I want to come back.

2541
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,850
It was a healing trip.

2542
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:34,890
(Come by and taste the food.)

2543
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,060
Everyone.

2544
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:40,360
I hope you become rich.

2545
01:32:40,490 --> 01:32:42,760
Uiryeong,
where the rich people are from.

2546
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:45,560
Come over
and take home some rich energy.

2547
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,870
Who are we?

2548
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:51,140
- 2 Days and 1 Night!
- And 1 Night!

2549
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:53,310
(Next episode)

2550
01:32:53,370 --> 01:32:54,510
(5:30 a.m., the day of the shoot)

2551
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:56,540
(The crew are tailing the members
as they come in?)

2552
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:57,680
(A sudden announcement
is made at 6:30 a.m.)

2553
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:58,910
(You can't move.
If you're in a car, get out!)

2554
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:00,750
(The members are ambushed.)

2555
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:02,550
(DinDin, get out of the car!)

2556
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:03,880
(Do I have to hurry?)

2557
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,820
(Yes, get out immediately!)

2558
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:06,850
(Se Yoon!)

2559
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:07,850
(What's this?)

2560
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,960
(They're given a sudden mission.)

2561
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:13,490
(They're trying to get to work,)

2562
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:16,700
(and the betrayal begins.)

2563
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:19,200
(What's happening to them?)

2564
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,400
You're such a good liar.

2565
01:33:22,370 --> 01:33:25,070
I just witnessed how good you are.
