1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,510
Cut it.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,810
- Who needs a dip?
- Cut it.

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,440
It sounds amazing.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,780
(The hard-won pork belly
is cooking nicely.)

5
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,610
- Can I taste a piece?
- Yes.

6
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,780
- Can I?
- Have a bit.

7
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,620
- Let's all have a piece.
- Yes, let's.

8
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,050
You eat this. It's cooked.

9
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,560
(It's hot but good.)

10
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,620
Do I eat it as is?

11
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,990
My gosh.

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,530
(Are they eating without us?)

13
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,900
Are you getting started?

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,440
- No.
- We're checking if it's cooked.

15
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,810
Are you?

16
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,910
- Do you want a piece each?
- No.

17
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,910
(Pitiful eyes)

18
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,080
It tastes great.

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,480
(The youngest
looks out for his friends.)

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,650
We're fine.

21
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,680
- You go ahead.
- Have a taste.

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,150
- We're fine.
- We tasted it.

23
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,750
It's incredible.

24
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,360
Se Yoon.

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,060
It's incredible.

26
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,060
(Taking a bite)

27
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,830
They should cook it some more.

28
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,060
They should cook it some more.

29
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,100
(He's complaining after being fed.)

30
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,670
(The stew is almost done.)

31
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,800
It's the basic seasoning.

32
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,900
Taste it for me.

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,970
- What more does it need?
- I think it's great.

34
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,580
Do you?

35
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,540
(Let me have a taste too.)

36
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,680
- Isn't it okay?
- It's pretty great.

37
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,350
Let's add the noodles.

38
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,580
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

39
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,920
(They can't do
without instant noodles.)

40
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Loosen it up.

41
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,650
No, take the lid off.

42
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,460
(Now they wait
for the noodles to cook.)

43
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,460
There.

44
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,030
(They worked hard to prepare dinner
with what little they had.)

45
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,500
It's crunchy outside, moist inside.

46
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,760
(Jong Min and DinDin
cooked the pork belly.)

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,300
- Shall we see?
- One, two, three.

48
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,670
It looks great.

49
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,570
(Se Yoon and Joon's budae stew)

50
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,010
- It smells insane.
- Let's dole it out.

51
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,280
The smell...

52
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,180
It smells like actual budae stew.

53
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,320
Se Yoon makes the best stews.

54
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,720
The smell is no joke.

55
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,650
- Let's eat.
- I'll enjoy this.

56
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,020
Thanks a lot.

57
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,460
- Hey, you need some soup.
- Soup.

58
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,530
There. You need soup and meat.

59
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,800
(They inhale the budae stew.)

60
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,600
Gosh, I need rice.

61
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,370
- The stew...
- There's no rice?

62
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,370
(The broth is the best.)

63
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,570
Se Yoon makes the best stews.

64
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,900
It tastes like a famous recipe.

65
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,710
It's great.

66
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,310
- It tastes almost scary.
- It's good.

67
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,770
(It's hard to resist
good food you're familiar with.)

68
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,140
Eat up.

69
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,080
- I made it, so enjoy.
- Thanks.

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,880
Wouldn't it be nice if we had rice?

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,150
(Glancing)

72
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,780
We don't get any, do we?

73
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,620
Earlier today,
worker Se Yoon said...

74
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,120
- What?
- You mentioned samhap.

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,560
Salted oysters
with rice is fantastic.

76
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,830
(They came across salted oysters
while grocery shopping.)

77
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,170
(That and rice with pork belly
is a perfect samhap.)

78
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,300
We thought of that.

79
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,740
Can't we do something
with one spoonful?

80
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,840
We'll give you just one shot.

81
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,940
- Yes.
- Okay.

82
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,110
Can I listen
as I slurp some noodles?

83
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,180
Yes.

84
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,680
- Go ahead.
- We'll give you one shot.

85
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,150
Bring it in, please.

86
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,350
- What?
- What?

87
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,450
(The mission to win salted oysters.)

88
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,690
(What's that?)

89
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,760
What's this?

90
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,890
(A scale and a strip of pork belly?)

91
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,330
Do we guess the weight?

92
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,630
If you cut a 15g piece
off the strip of pork belly,

93
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,570
we'll give you rice
and salted oysters.

94
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,600
- In one go?
- Yes.

95
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,600
How big is a 15g piece?

96
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,440
- As long as...
- I can't tell.

97
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,040
At a barbecue restaurant,
150 to 180g...

98
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,410
- is one portion.
- Yes.

99
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,580
- That's right.
- That's one piece.

100
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,810
Let's trust Se Yoon.

101
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,750
How are we to guess 15g?

102
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,550
Guess how much a portion is
and split that.

103
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,190
That makes sense,
but it's not that easy.

104
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,220
(They must trust in Se Yoon.)

105
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,320
Shall I tell you how much
that strip weighs?

106
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,330
Yes, that would be great.

107
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,430
It's 94? This is just 94g?

108
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,060
Divide that into eight pieces.

109
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,130
(He's more serious
than ever before.)

110
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,740
Just equally divide it
into eight chunks.

111
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,570
But it's hard to cut out
precisely 15g of meat.

112
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,570
It won't be easy.

113
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,740
You can just equally divide it
into eight chunks.

114
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,980
Even if he divides it
into eight chunks,

115
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,210
each chunk won't be 15g.

116
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,880
- It will be around 14g.
- Right. We'll have meat left over.

117
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,850
Let me try it. Let's pretend
we won't get to eat this.

118
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,720
- Just divide it into eight chunks.
- Right. Let's not get our hopes up.

119
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,750
Hold on.

120
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,020
(Will he be able to cut out
precisely 15g of meat?)

121
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,890
- This is it.
- Let me see.

122
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,160
- No. Fold it in half.
- No.

123
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,890
- I'm going to cut it in half.
- Then how many grams would it be?

124
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,230
- Cut it in half.
- Yes, cut it in half. It seems...

125
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,430
How many grams is it then?

126
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,470
(Careful)

127
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,140
(The rest of them are nervous too
as they watch him.)

128
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,840
- This one is slightly bigger.
- What was that?

129
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,810
So the total weight is 94g.

130
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,910
It's 47.25g.

131
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,140
Let's say this one weighs 44g,
and the other one, 50g.

132
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,740
- Just follow your gut.
- Follow your gut.

133
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,910
- Let's say this one weighs 44g.
- How can he cut out only 15g?

134
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,250
All right.

135
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,950
If I cut this in half,

136
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,420
- it'd be 22g. All right.
- It's 22g.

137
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,250
I think you can just remove
the cartilage.

138
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,060
Wouldn't it be exactly 15g...

139
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,260
if you remove the cartilage
on the right?

140
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,320
- There's cartilage?
- Yes.

141
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,660
That changes things completely then.

142
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,660
- The cartilage...
- I'm not going to do it.

143
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,600
Come on. You do it then.

144
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,670
You do it.

145
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,670
(Studying his face)

146
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,900
We believe in you.

147
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,270
(Regrouping himself)

148
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,570
(He thinks he has set
the weight of the meat to 22g.)

149
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,140
It was 44g. Then...

150
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,210
(If he cuts it in half again,
it will be 11g short.)

151
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,080
Hold on.

152
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,280
(Have some meat. You got this.)

153
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,980
- It'd be 19g.
- He needs some food to do this.

154
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,120
(Having a piece of meat
helps his brain work faster.)

155
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,290
(He focuses all of his attention
to his fingertips.)

156
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,390
(Cutting)

157
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,990
(He cut off the meat.)

158
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,000
That's too small.

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,230
(He thinks he has cut out about 15g
of meat based on his gut feeling.)

160
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,500
- This is...
- Just follow your gut feeling.

161
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,830
- I'll try it.
- That's your final piece, right?

162
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,370
- My gosh.
- Se Yoon.

163
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,240
- I think you got this.
- I'm nervous.

164
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,340
One, two, three.

165
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,140
(They only get one chance
to obtain the salted oysters...)

166
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,940
(for the samhap.)

167
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,140
(What's the result?)

168
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,250
- Gosh.
- What is it?

169
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,910
- What?
- It's 14.8g.

170
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,850
(He failed by only 0.2g.)

171
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,990
- What?
- It's 14.8g.

172
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,320
(They fail to get the salted oysters
because he was off by 0.2g.)

173
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,190
(Teary-eyed)

174
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,460
Se Yoon, come over here
and have some meat.

175
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,790
- I couldn't do it.
- Enjoy your food.

176
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,890
That was so close, though.

177
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,830
My food got soggy now.

178
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,900
- Should I grill the mushrooms?
- No.

179
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
Personally, this budae stew
is out of this world.

180
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
How did you make it taste this good?

181
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,340
You need to do that.

182
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,740
He did a good job making this.

183
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,910
(Approving)

184
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,980
(Bummed out)

185
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,580
We should've asked for the margin
of error before we began.

186
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,350
- We were too naive.
- Right.

187
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,150
We should've gotten 0.2g
for the margin of error.

188
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,180
- Right.
- Yes.

189
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,880
- Did you enjoy your meal?
- That was so close.

190
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,990
- Yes.
- Yes.

191
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,290
Just like you cooked your own meal,
on this country vacation,

192
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,290
you must clean up
after yourselves too.

193
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,390
- You must do everything yourselves.
- Yes. We can do that.

194
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,560
- Well, we've got workers here.
- Up until now...

195
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Yes.

196
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,430
Se Yoon and Joon worked really hard.

197
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,630
- Right.
- What?

198
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,900
- So we'll pick new workers now.
- Yes!

199
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,270
(They're going to switch workers.)

200
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,640
(Hooray!)

201
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,240
Does it mean we'll be excluded?

202
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,540
- You must do the mission too.
- Darn it.

203
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,280
(The former workers still have to
participate in the mission.)

204
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,580
I don't think I can do well
at these games.

205
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,080
(They might end up
becoming the workers again.)

206
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,650
Let's try to think it won't be us.

207
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,650
- So there's no pressure.
- Right.

208
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,820
All right.
Do you see the water ladle...

209
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,320
- by the faucet in the back?
- Yes.

210
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,750
You'll use the water ladle
to play the Surface Tension Game.

211
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,290
The loser will be worker number one.

212
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,320
This is the critical moment.
I've been...

213
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,030
- This is it.
- That's the set-up.

214
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,330
- Gosh, this is...
- You know how to play it, right?

215
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,630
- We can only use this?
- Yes. You can only use that.

216
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,800
Gosh, this...

217
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,470
Do we have to pour out
all the water...

218
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,170
- we scoop up?
- No.

219
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,170
- We don't have to, right?
- No.

220
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,240
- You can let it trickle down.
- Just one drop.

221
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,910
- All right. Let's pick the order.
- Can I only pour one drop then?

222
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,840
- All right. Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

223
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,180
(They play rock-paper-scissors
to decide the order.)

224
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,240
- The order is important.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

225
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,550
- I'll pour a lot of water.
- Jong Min.

226
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,550
- Yes, let's be bold.
- Gosh.

227
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
- What?
- Hey.

228
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,750
The rest of you should pay attention
if the water spills over.

229
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,890
- There's a lot of room left.
- There's so much room left.

230
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,690
- That's so little. Come on.
- Come on.

231
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,420
This is no fun at all.

232
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,130
- Let's make it fun.
- Right, let's make it fun.

233
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,960
- This is a variety show.
- Step back, Jong Min.

234
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,530
(Scooping up a lot of water)

235
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,730
That's a lot of water.

236
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,270
Pour out everything.

237
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,640
(Boldly pouring the water)

238
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,770
- No way.
- Gosh, it's gotten hard now.

239
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,970
- There's a lot of water. Darn.
- This just got difficult.

240
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,080
- Okay. This is good, right?
- It's lapping around.

241
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,780
Even if the wind makes the water
spill over, it still counts.

242
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,810
Of course.

243
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,010
All right.

244
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,050
(Se Yoon is the 3rd one to try.)

245
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,280
- I knew it.
- It's over.

246
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,350
(Careful)

247
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,850
Come on. Let's be bold.

248
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,990
(Trickling down)

249
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,360
(I can't be a worker
2 times in a row.)

250
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,720
- That was bold.
- Stop it.

251
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,760
- My gosh.
- Okay.

252
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,690
- That was a bold move.
- The water is lapping.

253
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,760
- Come on. Don't be like that.
- Come on.

254
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,730
If you don't want to go again,
you must pour more.

255
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,800
- Come on.
- Listen to me.

256
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,970
- Pour some more.
- Wait.

257
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,340
Pour some more.
You can still push more.

258
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,570
- That way, one of them will be out.
- Seriously.

259
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,870
- Yes. Keep going.
- So...

260
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,870
- if you keep going,
- You must keep going.
you might be in trouble.

261
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,310
- Do you think you can pour more?
- Of course.

262
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,810
(DinDin is the 5th one to try.)

263
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,450
- We're still good.
- There's a lot more room left.

264
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,510
- We're good.
- Okay.

265
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,120
That was bold.

266
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,380
(Jutting out)

267
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,390
(Feeling scared)

268
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,750
- It's over now.
- Gosh.

269
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,520
- It's about to spill over.
- It maxed out.

270
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,720
- I poured more than I thought.
- It maxed out.

271
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
No.

272
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,060
- We have a long way to go.
- Joon.

273
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,160
We still have a lot of room.

274
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,630
Joon.
You're already a worker, anyway.

275
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,430
Stay that way.

276
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,570
Just pour a few drops.
It won't make it back to your turn.

277
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,440
Can you pretend you've lost it
and pour out everything?

278
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,670
Joon, you must win this
no matter what.

279
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,640
Joon. You were born to be a worker.

280
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,650
Hold on. That's insulting.

281
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,810
- This is just a game.
- Hey.

282
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,380
- I meant just today.
- It's just a game.

283
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,120
- Just on our show.
- Yes. It's just a game.

284
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,220
- I bet you heard stuff like...
- I'll do it.

285
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,020
"You're a champion"
while acting in dramas.

286
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,520
"You were born to be a worker."

287
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,660
(What a novel thing to say.)

288
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,690
"You're just a worker."

289
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,090
It totally broke my focus.

290
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,260
You're the best worker.

291
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,730
One drop would count too.

292
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,760
(He's focused again.)

293
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,030
Yes. One drop would count too.

294
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,300
- Okay. All right.
- Gosh.

295
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,100
Jong Min is next.

296
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
- It's my turn again? It is.
- Yes.

297
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,070
Jong Min. It's your turn.

298
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,440
Everyone, from now on,
let's count to three...

299
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,910
- after pouring the water.
- Okay.

300
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,980
- Jong Min.
- Pour it and wait three seconds.

301
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,010
Let's go, Jong Min.

302
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,150
- One,
- My gosh.

303
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,310
- Did you see that?
- two,

304
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,680
- three.
- I was bold.

305
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,080
- Jong Min passes.
- I was pretty bold.

306
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,180
The water might spill over
at any minute now.

307
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,550
Sae Ho.

308
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,760
- One, two, three.
- That's pretty tough.

309
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,320
Did it spill over?

310
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,460
- Gosh, this...
- My goodness.

311
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,790
- It will be one of them now.
- Wait.

312
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,030
- It will be 1 of the 4.
- Gosh.

313
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,060
- It's shaking.
- One of them will lose.

314
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Se Yoon.

315
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,900
You're the best...

316
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,230
(The best worker)

317
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,540
- Hold on.
- What?

318
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,800
- Stop that.
- What?

319
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,610
- Get some water. You have no water.
- Right.

320
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,610
There's a lot.

321
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,540
(What will happen?)

322
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,150
One, two, three.

323
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,980
(Se Yoon passes.)

324
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,320
- You have to pour a lot, Seon Ho.
- Don't worry.

325
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,580
- So you won't have to go again.
- Come on. Don't say that.

326
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,150
If the water spills over
because of the raindrops,

327
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,590
- it will still count.
- Okay.

328
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,290
Gosh, this has gotten so hard now.

329
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,660
Hey, hurry up. It's raining.

330
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,390
- Raindrops are falling. Hurry up.
- Gosh.

331
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,330
- You're a worker.
- Seon Ho, you must hurry up.

332
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,830
- Hurry up.
- Spill.

333
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,530
- Great.
- Hey, it's raining.

334
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,470
- Hey, it's shaking.
- I'm feeling the raindrops.

335
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,340
- Hey, it's shaking.
- One, two...

336
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,070
Gosh, this is risky now.

337
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,510
- It's spilling over.
- Gosh, this is risky now.

338
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,410
- No, it's not.
- This is risky.

339
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,310
It's raining now. We must hurry.

340
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,550
I could've poured a little more.

341
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,950
One, two, three.

342
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,580
- Okay.
- Gosh, what is this?

343
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,190
- Gosh, DinDin poured a lot.
- This is risky now.

344
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,620
- It's risky. It'll spill over now.
- You don't need more water?

345
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,160
Jong Min, root for him.

346
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,320
- It'll spill over now.
- Joon, it's you!

347
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,190
It won't be me.

348
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,260
It will spill over. It did.

349
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,860
- It's windy. This is no good.
- It will spill over.

350
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,200
- It's windy.
- It's windy.

351
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,870
- You must hurry up.
- Why is it windy?

352
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,970
- What?
- Just pour it.

353
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,800
- You're the best worker.
- Hey, this is...

354
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,900
Hold on.

355
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,610
- Joon. You're...
- Joon!

356
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,810
You're the best worker.
(His eyes are fixed on the water.)

357
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,080
It's over.

358
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,050
One, two...

359
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,980
- Jong Min.
- You did well.

360
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,250
- Jong Min. Goodbye.
- You should...

361
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,780
- get some water.
- DinDin.

362
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,320
- I have some water here.
- I think it might be one of us.

363
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,390
- Why would I do that? I have water.
- Goodbye.

364
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,850
It will be you.

365
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,320
(Heart pounding)

366
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
Pour as much as you can.

367
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,960
(Boldly pouring a lot of water)

368
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,860
- One, two, three.
- Gosh, he's pushing it now.

369
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,160
Jong Min passes.

370
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,900
- Jong Min passes.
- It's spilling.

371
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,730
I'm bold.
I have the chest of a lion.

372
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,800
People don't say, "chest of a lion."

373
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,700
Don't people say,
"The heart of a beast?"

374
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,470
Who says "chest of a lion?"

375
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,880
(They mean the same thing.)

376
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,780
(They've already gone
five rounds at this.)

377
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,480
(They continue to battle
with the surface tension.)

378
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,850
- It could spill over at any minute.
- It could spill over now.

379
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,050
That's the surface tension.

380
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,190
- You can still go more.
- That's it, right?

381
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,190
Really?

382
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,560
I don't think you can do it.
That's it. Bye.

383
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,590
(Even the slightest breeze
could make the water spill over.)

384
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,730
- That's it.
- No, I think he can do it.

385
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,660
- No. I don't think he can do it.
- It might be one of the last times.

386
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,230
- I think...
- You were born to be a worker!

387
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,300
It will spill over.

388
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,570
- The best worker.
- It will spill over.

389
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,340
(I don't want to wear
this green vest anymore.)

390
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,470
Garlic and ssamjang.

391
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,340
(The worker's intense desire
of freedom)

392
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,310
(Will he end up becoming
a worker again?)

393
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,810
Poor Joon. My gosh.

394
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,850
(Wobbling)

395
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,850
- The best worker.
- It will spill over.

396
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,120
Poor Joon. My gosh.

397
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,160
- Gosh.
- What?

398
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,960
- That was no joke.
- It's so close to spilling.

399
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,260
The water is rolling
around the edges.

400
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,290
(Joon barely manages to pass.)

401
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,890
The chest of a lion.

402
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,800
Yes!

403
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,300
The chest of a lion.

404
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,300
(Spilling over)

405
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,680
(The surface sharply trembles.)

406
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,610
(The water breaks.)

407
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,650
(Everyone is...)

408
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,950
(cheering.)

409
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,620
(Darn it!)

410
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,820
(I survived it!)

411
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,130
- That was close.
- Look at the water spilling.

412
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,230
(They huddle together in joy.)

413
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,900
Gosh, justice is alive.

414
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,400
- It keeps spilling.
- Justice is alive.

415
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,700
- The water keeps spilling over.
- That's Jong Min's tear.

416
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,400
Jong Min, you will be a worker.

417
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,170
- Gosh.
- All right.

418
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,710
- You have the chest of a lion.
- Seriously.

419
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,240
- We have to pick one more, right?
- My gosh.

420
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,480
Yes. We must pick one more worker.

421
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,440
- Gosh, this was crazy.
- It was nerve-racking.

422
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,610
Gosh, Jong Min. The last one...

423
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,950
(They go straight to the selection
of the second worker.)

424
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,180
- The best worker.
- Everyone.

425
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,720
We'll pick the last worker
through a very simple mission.

426
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,290
Okay. Please make it simple.

427
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,450
- Do you see this?
- Yes.

428
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,790
- Yes.
- Inside here...

429
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,690
are five pairs of cotton gloves,

430
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,360
bearing the names
of the remaining members.

431
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,660
- Except for Jong Min's name.
- That will be fun.

432
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,830
You'll grab one pair
of cotton gloves.

433
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,100
You'll stand over there...

434
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,230
and throw the gloves
to get it inside the red bucket.

435
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,300
- That sounds fun.
- All right.

436
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,400
The owner of the gloves
that go into the bucket first...

437
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,270
will be the worker.

438
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,440
- Okay.
- My gosh.

439
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,840
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

440
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,010
(They play rock-paper-scissors
to choose the order.)

441
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,150
(DinDin won 1st place.)

442
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,010
- DinDin... Gosh.
- Sae Ho.

443
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,720
- I'm sorry. I'm good at this.
- Hey.

444
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,920
Be mindful of that.

445
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,620
Joon.

446
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,290
- No.
- DinDin.

447
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,550
I'm sorry, but I got you.

448
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,320
- Who did you get?
- Joon.

449
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,360
I got you, DinDin.

450
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,490
(Se Yoon gets Seon Ho's.
Joon gets Se Yoon's.)

451
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,160
- Se Yoon.
- It won't happen on our first try.

452
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,200
(DinDin has Sae Ho's.
Seon Ho has DinDin.)

453
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,660
(Se Yoon has Seon Ho's.
Sae Ho has Joon's.)

454
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,830
(Joon has Se Yoon's.)

455
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,300
- It won't happen on our first try.
- What?

456
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,240
- Se Yoon.
- Let's line up.

457
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
(Se Yoon's flip-flop breaks apart.)

458
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,670
You should wear mine
during the game at least.

459
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,740
- Gosh, thank you.
- Sure.

460
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,010
Can we do it in the middle?

461
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,780
(He borrows
Director Joo's flip-flops.)

462
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,080
Now that I'm wearing
these flip-flops, I sound like...

463
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,520
(He starts teasing Director Joo.)

464
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,820
"Se Yoon, you should wear mine."

465
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,120
"Se Yoon."

466
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,560
These are magic shoes.

467
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,530
We can't do it on our first try.
It's quite far.

468
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,760
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

469
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,000
- We can't do it on our first try.
- If one of you succeeds...

470
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,270
- That's it.
- For example, if DinDin succeeds,

471
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,270
- it's over.
- Okay.

472
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,900
- Please make Sae Ho the worker.
- Please succeed on your first try.

473
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,240
- Gosh.
- Here I go.

474
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,810
My gosh. This is driving me crazy.

475
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,310
That's quite far.
There's no way we can do it.

476
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,440
- It's far. It won't be easy.
- My gosh.

477
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
- We need at least three rounds.
- My gosh.
- They're smart. What a novel game.
- Here I go.

478
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,910
(Please don't succeed.)

479
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,980
Gosh, there's no way.

480
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,650
(What will be Sae Ho's fate?)

481
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,650
If he manages to succeed...
Gosh, that was good.

482
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,790
Gosh, there's no way.

483
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,790
(Getting the chills)

484
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,030
- That was close.
- It was a bold throw.

485
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,460
Gosh, DinDin was close.
Hey, what's wrong with you?

486
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,260
- He's going to tease you. Hurry.
- Hey, be careful.

487
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,230
There's no way I can do it.
I'll just see how it goes.

488
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,670
(He gently throws the gloves.)

489
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,980
(Rolling off)

490
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,550
(Scared)

491
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
- I got the hang of it.
- That was close.

492
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,580
- He got the hang of it.
- I got the hang of it now.

493
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,650
- This is better, right?
- Shout out the name as you throw.

494
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,050
Seon Ho.

495
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
(Se Yoon will try next.)

496
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,420
(He can't possibly succeed.)

497
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,520
He did it.

498
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,460
(Going in)

499
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,900
(Se Yoon successfully escapes
the fate of a worker.)

500
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,470
(Laughing)

501
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,630
Magic shoes!

502
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,800
(He gets to stop being a worker
thanks to Se Yoon.)

503
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,640
(Seon Ho has become the worker.)

504
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,880
(Their fates have switched
just like that.)

505
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,250
Magic shoes!

506
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,720
(The magic shoes are
quite effective.)

507
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,880
Magic shoes.

508
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,090
(What am I going to do?)

509
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,150
I love you.

510
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,490
- I'm sorry. All right.
- Our Own Country Vacation.

511
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,490
I love you.

512
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,290
- I'm sorry.
- My gosh.

513
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,630
(Flinging down the vest)

514
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,160
I'm sorry
my lymph nodes are swollen.

515
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,400
Gosh, magic shoes!

516
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,730
(Se Yoon and Joon get to break free
from the fates of workers.)

517
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,700
- All right. Let's clean up.
- Okay.

518
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,000
- Will this fit you?
- We just have to play a game...

519
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,270
- to decide sleeping arrangements.
- This is big.

520
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,500
- Okay.
- Yes.

521
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,770
- All right.
- Wash everything with detergent.

522
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,770
- Okay.
- And put this back.

523
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,240
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

524
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,010
Since you're a worker,
could you clap for the slate?

525
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,010
Okay.

526
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,210
(For the first task of the worker,
he claps for the slate.)

527
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,650
One... Here?

528
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,280
One, two, three.

529
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,120
It won't take long.

530
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,620
- This is comforting.
- I'll do that. Leave it there.

531
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
(Worker 1 soaks
the greasy plates...)

532
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,700
(while Seon Ho clears the table.)

533
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,070
(Meanwhile, the survivors
lie down in the room right away.)

534
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,570
(Exhaling)

535
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,470
Joon, are you good at Halli Galli?

536
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,170
- Me?
- Yes.

537
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,580
Do you want to play?

538
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,410
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

539
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,780
- We can play with just two people?
- Of course.

540
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,780
The game gets more intense
when it's played with two people.

541
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,850
- Playing with just two people...
- Do you want to join us?

542
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,490
- Halli Galli?
- I'll watch you play first.

543
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,690
(They're having a fun time
as if they're on a real trip.)

544
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,890
(Envious)

545
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,060
- Jong Min, help me.
- What? I'm working too.

546
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,230
Why don't you wash them
with dish soap? I'll rinse them.

547
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,140
So we can take turns to rest.

548
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,700
- Sure.
- Right.

549
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,840
I've been living alone
for ten years now.

550
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,110
I've been living on my own
at the age of 15.

551
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,480
I'm 24 now. So it's been 10 years.

552
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,680
But you couldn't have lived alone
when you were 15.

553
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,050
- I lived in the dorm back then.
- In the dorm.

554
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,120
I did all the cleaning.

555
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,150
- Really?
- Of course.

556
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,150
No wonder. You're really good.

557
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,560
- Aren't I really good?
- Yes.

558
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,360
How old were you
when you first lived on your own?

559
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,260
I think I was...

560
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,300
twenty-three.

561
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,900
I was so busy.

562
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,370
- I was busy with KOYOTE.
- Right.

563
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,370
Right.

564
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,940
(Jong Min in his 20s
lived a busy life.)

565
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,040
- I liked that I was busy.
- Right.

566
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,850
I used to live in the dorm
with 7 or 8 guys.

567
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,850
- I couldn't sleep well.
- Living alone...

568
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,880
Of course.

569
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,650
When you live with someone,
you must constantly accommodate.

570
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,320
Right. There were two more guys
who snored like Se Yoon.

571
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,160
Gosh, then it must've been tough.

572
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,790
I was a sensitive sleeper,
to begin with.

573
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,230
(As it's just the two of them
in the kitchen...)

574
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,630
Living alone was amazing.

575
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,370
(they share their innermost feelings
and thoughts.)

576
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,370
- Are you happy now?
- Yes.

577
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,940
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min, hurry over here.

578
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,540
- I have to wash the dishes.
- What?

579
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,740
We just need one of you
to come over here.

580
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,440
You should go inside.

581
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,010
I'll rinse them.

582
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,250
- I'm done.
- Jong Min.

583
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,280
Could you bring the ice cream
from the freezer?

584
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,350
- Yes.
- Let's have ice cream.

585
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,020
- Let's all have some ice cream.
- The ice cream.

586
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,950
Hey, you!

587
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,920
- You're not coming?
- Hey, you!

588
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,360
- Hey.
- Let's go.

589
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,760
- We only have four left.
- Really?

590
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,860
- We have exactly four left.
- Hey.

591
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,360
I thought you wanted this.

592
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,570
- Let's split that.
- Yes.

593
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,270
- I want to have that.
- I'll take this.

594
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,370
- Can I have that?
- Let's split that.

595
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,370
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

596
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,600
Then we have one ice pop left.

597
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,710
One of you workers should come
and put away the board game.

598
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,740
Now.

599
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,740
- Now!
- Put away the board game!

600
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,740
Come on!

601
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,050
Five, four,

602
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,620
- I'm coming.
- three, two...

603
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,880
Yes. Since you're here,
you can have this.

604
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,950
(Granting the ice pop
to the obedient worker)

605
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,620
- Thank you.
- Go and show it...

606
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,120
- Thank you.
- to the lazy worker.

607
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,160
I washed them with dish soap.
He's only rinsing them.

608
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,530
All right. Look at this.

609
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,130
The diligent worker
will get to have ice cream.

610
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,870
- Gosh, this life is sweet.
- Of course, it is.

611
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,530
This is amazing.

612
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,340
So this is how it felt.

613
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,300
How is it?

614
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,440
Come here and split this for me.

615
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,110
- What? Come on.
- I don't have any energy.

616
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,680
I'm rinsing the dishes now.

617
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,650
Take off the rubber gloves
and help me.

618
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,980
- Okay.
- Why is this worker so chatty?

619
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,550
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

620
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,360
(It's a dud
since they're not split evenly.)

621
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,990
(Licking)

622
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,560
(That's mine.)

623
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,230
(After a sugary pick-me-up,)

624
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,570
(the thorough worker makes sure
everything is clean.)

625
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,940
Good job.

626
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,910
- Good job.
- Good job.

627
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,070
You can rest on your feet.

628
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,680
(Well done. Rest up on your feet.)

629
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,750
Jong Min,
could you put this away now?

630
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,250
- I haven't eaten it yet.
- Put it away.

631
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,350
You haven't? This...

632
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,360
(The night in the countryside
is darker and quieter.)

633
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,290
(Their bedtime is approaching.)

634
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,300
(The workers get to rest now.)

635
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,330
Right.

636
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,770
(The workers get to rest now.)

637
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,300
So this is what we're doing
without our phone.

638
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,840
- Se Yoon is staring at the clock.
- Director Joo.

639
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,540
- Workers.
- Yes.

640
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,440
Let's spread the blankets now.

641
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,640
Old worker!

642
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,150
Hey, where's the old worker?

643
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,680
(The old worker
peeks into the room.)

644
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,350
Could you tell us
how many of us are sleeping inside?

645
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,780
So we know how many sets
of blankets we should spread.

646
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,790
Start with three for now.

647
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,890
What? Three?

648
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,920
Workers,
spread three sets of blankets.

649
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,990
It's already done.

650
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,930
- You must bring in the blankets.
- These aren't...

651
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,790
These aren't blankets.

652
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,400
- Should we come out?
- Yes.

653
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,330
- Should we come out now?
- Come out.

654
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,370
Workers.

655
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,070
- Tell us. What are we going to do?
- Everyone.

656
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,770
How was your vacation
in the countryside?

657
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,310
- It was great.
- It was excellent.

658
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,440
- We had so much fun.
- Yes.

659
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,180
It's been a while
since we got to relax like this.

660
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,940
I realized
the real taste of traveling.

661
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,410
The game of Sleeping Indoors
or Outdoors...

662
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,220
must continue even during
your vacation in the countryside.

663
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,280
- Of course.
- Yes.

664
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,850
Could you bring it in?

665
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,450
- Bring what in?
- What's that?

666
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,790
- What? It's a radio.
- What?

667
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,890
- I'm scared.
- This is scary.

668
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,330
(Why is there a cassette tape?)

669
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,560
(Throughout their vacation
in the countryside,)

670
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,870
(the cassette tape player had been
in the corner of the room.)

671
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,500
I should've brought my guitar.

672
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,700
(Spotting the cassette tapes)

673
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,040
(After discovering
the nostalgic item,)

674
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,980
(Se Yoon used it to have a blast
during lunchtime.)

675
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,350
When I was taking a nap earlier,
Se Yoon used this...

676
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,610
to play "Kick It."

677
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,680
When you were kids, have you all...

678
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,950
- Well, has DinDin used this before?
- I have.

679
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,120
When we were kids,
there were no cell phones and stuff.

680
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,790
When we went on picnics
or school trips,

681
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,260
- we would bring a cassette tape.
- Right.

682
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,590
We put earphones on...

683
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,130
- and listened to music in the car.
- That's right.

684
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,400
I think it didn't charge fully.
It seemed almost out of battery.

685
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,630
Really?

686
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,900
I don't know
how to use a cassette tape player.

687
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,140
(Seon Ho, who was born in 2002...)

688
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,410
(has learned how to use it as well.)

689
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,740
(It's exciting.)

690
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,280
All right. Today,

691
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,380
we'll use a cassette tape
which brings us back old memories...

692
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,720
to decide who sleeps indoors
and who sleeps outdoors.

693
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,550
- How?
- I have no memories of it.

694
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,950
- It's an individual game.
- Okay.

695
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,890
(Out of 7 songs,)

696
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,560
(there's only one chosen song.)

697
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,300
Starting at the first track,
the player will fast forward.

698
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,470
(While the player fast forwards...)

699
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,770
(3. "Listen To Me" by Papaya,
4. "Sexy Guy" by Space A)

700
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,070
(5. "Ppuyo Ppuyo" by UP,
6. "Give To You" by Lee Jung Hyun)

701
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,370
(While the player fast forwards...)

702
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,670
If you press the play button...

703
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,610
when the mission song plays,

704
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,780
you will sleep indoors.

705
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,410
(If you fail, you have to wait
until the next round to try again.)

706
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,020
While the cassette player
is fast forwarding,

707
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,990
you will wait for the right time
to press the button, right?

708
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,220
If none of you presses the button
until Side A ends,

709
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,790
- Then Side B will start.
- then...

710
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,130
all of you will sleep outdoors.

711
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,600
This game is all about luck.
Let's do this.

712
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
- It partly relies on luck,
- It's all about luck.

713
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,770
but most songs from these years
are 3 to 4 minutes long.

714
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,840
- Most of them are that long.
- But we don't know...

715
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,910
how fast it fast forwards.

716
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,040
If the person before you fails,
you could take a rough guess...

717
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,080
how long is left
until the mission track.

718
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,740
- That's important in this game.
- I see your point.

719
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,610
- The first player will give a hint.
- Exactly.

720
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,950
But the first one to play...

721
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,880
might have a good hunch and succeed.

722
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,020
- Of course.
- Yes.

723
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,520
- Okay.
- Anyway...

724
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,920
I used a cassette player many times
when I was younger.

725
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,790
Let's say
"Ppuyo Ppuyo" is the mission song.

726
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Yes.

727
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,390
- If one of us presses the button,
- Yes.

728
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,690
and the song begins right then...

729
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,530
One, two, three, four

730
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,900
Then let all of us sleep indoors.

731
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,570
- It's a really hard thing to do.
- Right.

732
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,670
- Okay. Sounds fair.
- If the intro comes out...

733
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,700
No,
the song should start right then.

734
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,800
- If the song starts?
- I have an idea.

735
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,900
Yes, if the song starts right then.

736
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,700
All right.
The song for the first round is...

737
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,070
the fourth track on Side A.

738
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,180
- The fourth track?
- "Sexy Guy?"

739
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,780
- Yes.
- Is it a song by Space A?

740
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,380
What song is it?

741
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,980
(You are my sexy guy?)

742
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,150
- Sexy guy
- "Sexy Guy." Okay.

743
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,320
Is that right?

744
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,020
(Something was wrong about it,
but let's let it slide.)

745
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
Hey.
- Let's begin.
- That was funny.

746
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,590
Press the fast forward button.

747
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,890
- Here we go.
- We can just...

748
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,660
- We can just guess when to stop it.
- Yes.

749
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,330
We'll succeed if the song plays
when we press the button.

750
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,360
Is it fast forwarding right now?

751
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,300
"City Escape" is being skipped.

752
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,830
The tape has
all of the popular songs.

753
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:01,370
(They'll succeed
if they play the fourth track.)

754
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,280
(Which of the songs is being skipped
right now?)

755
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,780
(Right then, Jong Min gets up!)

756
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,980
(Is the 4th track being skipped
right now?)

757
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,350
Not now. There's no way.

758
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,850
- It's Papaya's song.
- It's "City Escape."

759
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,020
- You were too fast.
- Stop.

760
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,760
(The song
that's being played now...)

761
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,460
(dominated the music industry
in the summer of 1997.)

762
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
("City Escape" by Clon)

763
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,230
- You failed.
- What? It's still...

764
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,900
- It's still "City Escape?"
- Yes.

765
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,330
- Move back.
- You pressed the button.

766
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,330
- Let's go to the blue ocean
- All of you, move back.

767
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,500
- You mustn't see the tape now.
- Let's escape the busy city

768
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,370
- You mustn't see the tape.
- We should move back?

769
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,770
- It's still the first track?
- I won't see it.

770
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,670
Let's do it

771
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,610
- Right now...
- The song must be about to end.

772
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,750
(Still, they now know roughly
how fast it fast forwards.)

773
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,950
(Trying to read one another's mind)

774
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,220
The songwriter is very talented.

775
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,550
(The tape was wound
a little bit more.)

776
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,890
- I was too fast.
- I love you

777
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,720
(1. "City Escape" by Clon,
2. "Sunset Glow" by Lee Moon Sae)

778
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,760
- Now is the time.
- Okay.

779
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,030
Go ahead.

780
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,530
(Se Yoon pressed the button!)

781
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,360
Papaya! It's Papaya's song.

782
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,700
- I'll fast forward it now.
- Okay.

783
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,770
(Now: "Listen To Me" by Papaya,
Goal: "Sexy Guy" by Space A)

784
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,040
Only one song is left.

785
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,470
- I mean, half.
- Now is the time.

786
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,070
(The chance to sleep indoors
is just around the corner.)

787
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,370
- Move back.
- Move back, guys.

788
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,380
(Seon Ho pressed the button!)

789
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,480
Not there yet.

790
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,680
(I want
to believe it will last forever)

791
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,380
- Not there yet.
- Press it.

792
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,250
(It's still the 3rd track.)

793
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,080
(We'll show you
which part of the song this is.)

794
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,750
("Listen To Me" by Papaya)

795
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,720
(The 3rd track is about to end!)

796
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,460
- Not there yet.
- Press it.

797
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,290
(What a shame.)

798
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,900
- Press it now.
- Keep your hands away from it.

799
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,000
- Press it now. Hurry.
- Keep your hands away from it.

800
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
- Keep your hands away from it.
- Now is the time.

801
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,330
(The competition is fierce.)

802
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,140
(Who will be the first person
to sleep indoors?)

803
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,170
- Keep your hands away from it.
- Hold on.

804
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,710
- Okay! I'll press it.
- Wait.

805
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,210
(DinDin pressed the button!)

806
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,710
I was going to press it.

807
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,720
(He played the 4th track,
"Sexy Guy.")

808
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,350
- Gosh.
- Why didn't you press it?

809
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,420
I was going to press it.

810
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,490
(He missed his chance
to sleep indoors by a small margin.)

811
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,920
(DinDin will sleep indoors!)

812
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,630
I'll probably sleep outdoors tonight.

813
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,730
- All right. Let's do this.
- This time,

814
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,700
- we'll play Side B.
- Okay.

815
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,870
- Which track?
- "Sweety" is a good song.

816
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,900
Let's choose "Be Responsible."

817
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,700
- "A Look at Myself" by Deux.
- Or how about Click-B's song?

818
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
It's been a while.

819
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,670
- Let's go with "Undefeatable."
- I can do it

820
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,810
(Among the requested songs...)

821
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,310
Take responsibility for my life

822
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,610
- We'll go with "Undefeatable."
- While waiting for "Undefeatable,"

823
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,510
- Untitle.
- the tape could come to an end.

824
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,350
(If I fight 100 times,
I'll win 100 times)

825
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,480
(The old, great song
that was released in 2001)

826
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,960
(They'll succeed if they stop it
at "Undefeatable" by Click-B!)

827
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,020
- Okay.
- It's so far from the beginning.

828
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,790
- There are five songs before it.
- You'll hear the guitar sound.

829
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,960
There are five songs before it.

830
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,730
Here we go.

831
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,730
Ready. Go.

832
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,300
(8. "Sweety" by Sharp,
9. "Now" by Fin.K.L)

833
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,470
(10. "Sea of Love" by Fly To the Sky,
11. "A Look at Myself" by Deux)

834
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,670
(12. "Be Responsible" by Untitle,
13. "Undefeatable" by Click-B)

835
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:52,310
(From the 8th track,
the tape is being wound fast.)

836
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:56,150
(They have to rely on their hunches
to play the 13th track.)

837
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,180
Gosh. This is hard.

838
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,320
We should stop it accurately.

839
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,050
- Or else, the tape could end.
- Right.

840
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,960
(They all seem relaxed,
but they're actually nervous.)

841
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,390
It's been quite long...

842
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,860
Guys.

843
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,930
(Right then,
Director Joo is surprised.)

844
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,000
Guys.

845
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,700
I'll go now.

846
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,370
- Look back at me
- Here I go.

847
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,170
(Will the 13th track "Undefeatable"
be played?)

848
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,200
- Move aside.
- Se Yoon.

849
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,500
- What was that?
- It's Hwanhee's voice.

850
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,840
(So little was wound.)

851
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Will you press it?

852
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,050
(It's still the 10th track,
"Sea of Love" by Fly To the Sky.)

853
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,750
- Move aside.
- What was that?

854
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,320
(It has a long way to go.)

855
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,280
I'm done for.

856
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,020
(Sae Ho failed.)

857
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,020
(The tape paused at Track 10
and started being wound again.)

858
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,030
(They're waiting
for the 13th track.)

859
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,960
- You should press it now.
- No.

860
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,030
- Joon, trust me and press it.
- No. Not yet.

861
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,470
I'm serious.

862
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,430
- You should press it now!
- No, I don't have to.

863
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,470
- It's not there yet.
- You have to trust me.

864
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,040
- No.
- Joon, press it.

865
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
No.

866
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,110
(Just a little bit more...)

867
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,640
- Joon, press it.
- No.

868
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,610
- Now is the time, Joon.
- No, it's not there yet.

869
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,420
(Is Joon's hunch right?)

870
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,650
- All right.
- If it got to "I Can Do It..."

871
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,650
(Se Yoon tried to press it,
but someone else did.)

872
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,490
(Joon pressed the button.)

873
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,230
He was right.

874
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,160
(He played the 13th track,
"Undefeatable.")

875
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,300
I was going to press it.

876
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,600
(Joon will sleep indoors.)

877
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,800
When other people do it

878
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,170
(They can't hide
their disappointment.)

879
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,240
(Joon doesn't care.)

880
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,710
He's excited.

881
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Gosh. We're in trouble.

882
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,110
(The "Undefeatable" dance)

883
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,550
Joon is good at doing this dance.

884
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,950
Way to go!

885
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,850
(Back to the Year 2001)

886
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,290
How does he remember
this choreography?

887
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,490
(Oh Jong Hyuk, 19 years old)

888
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,590
He's good at it.

889
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,130
(I'm standing at a fork in the road)

890
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
He's good at it.

891
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,400
Way to go!

892
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,970
- Keep going. That's great.
- Joon, way to go.

893
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,040
(He copies Click-B perfectly.)

894
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,080
(Lee Joon-B is awakened
after 24 years.)

895
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,550
Congratulations.

896
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,220
- All right. Joon...
- How did he know?

897
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,050
will sleep indoors.

898
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,390
- Okay. Congratulations.
- One more person to sleep indoors.

899
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,350
- This is the final round.
- Okay.

900
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,790
The winner will be the last one
to sleep indoors.

901
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,890
The tape is...

902
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,200
- stopped at the end.
- Yes, "Sad Dream."

903
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,260
The song ended.

904
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,070
So we're going to rewind the tape.

905
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,070
- Okay.
- It'll go back up.

906
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,170
The mission song
for this round is...

907
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,470
the first track, "Bo Peep Bo Peep."

908
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,140
That's too far.

909
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,470
(7. "Sad Dream" by KOYOTE)

910
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,510
(They have to stop it
at the 1st track.)

911
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,780
Ready. Go.

912
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,850
DinDin, can you move aside?

913
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,020
- I need to see the song titles.
- It's slow.

914
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,020
(The tape is being rewound
from the 7th track.)

915
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,290
It rewinds slowly.

916
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,230
- It fast forwards really fast.
- I don't think you're right.

917
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,360
- It's too slow.
- Really?

918
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,860
It'll take a long time to get there.

919
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,460
It's still the seventh track,
I'm sure.

920
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,330
(He was lying.)

921
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,640
(Giggling)

922
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,840
"Tell Me" was almost skipped.

923
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,300
No, it's at the end of "Tell Me."

924
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,270
No, "Sad Dream" was just skipped.

925
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,340
No, I don't think so.

926
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,140
We shouldn't let him fool us.

927
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,810
He wants no one else
to sleep indoors with him.

928
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,550
(The members who will sleep indoors)

929
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,380
It's still at "Two of Us."

930
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,450
No,
"Shaky Friendship" is almost over.

931
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,420
- That song just began.
- I am the prince of the sea

932
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,550
(All they do is make assumptions
as they can't see the tape.)

933
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,660
I don't know.
I'll just trust my hunch.

934
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,790
I won't try to use my brain.

935
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,790
Seon Ho,
shall I tell you when to press it?

936
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,390
(The tape has been rewound a lot!)

937
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,430
I'm going to trust you guys.

938
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,760
- Press it.
- It's at "Shaky Friendship" now.

939
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,860
(Should I press it or not?)

940
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,370
"Shaky Friendship"
is being skipped now.

941
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,800
(They're swarming
like hyenas hunting a prey.)

942
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,900
(There's only one chance left.)

943
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,170
(Only one more person
can sleep indoors.)

944
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,010
No, "Shaky Friendship"
is still being skipped.

945
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,410
It just got to the end
of "Prince of the Sea."

946
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,310
No, it just got to the end
of "Shaky Friendship."

947
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,750
No, "Shaky Friendship"
is being skipped now.

948
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,150
(The tape has been rewound
almost to the beginning.)

949
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,090
(Anxious)

950
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,520
(Trying to read the room)

951
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
(He notices something.)

952
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,490
It's about to end.

953
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,890
- "Prince of the Sea" just began.
- Press it.

954
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,930
- You do that.
- Press it.

955
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,430
- You press it.
- No, you do it.

956
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,760
- Come on. Press it.
- Hey, you press it.

957
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,200
- Okay.
- It's still "Prince of the Sea."

958
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,700
Let's go. One, two...

959
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,500
(Sae Ho presses the button first
in the end.)

960
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,470
- Great. We'll all sleep indoors.
- All of us...

961
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,770
- will sleep indoors, right?
- We'll all sleep indoors.

962
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,940
(The moment he pressed the button
"bo peep" came out.)

963
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,740
(All of them will sleep indoors!)

964
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,010
- No, that part...
- Why?

965
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,380
is not the beginning of the song.
Am I right?

966
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,420
- You heard the intro.
- No, it's not...

967
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,380
- No, that doesn't count.
- But "bo peep..."

968
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,350
- I think that's the beginning.
- No, it's not.

969
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,260
(The words that "Bo Peep Bo Peep"
starts with...)

970
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,790
(are not "bo peep.")

971
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,530
I said that it should be the start.

972
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,460
If he had waited longer,
the song would've been over.

973
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,530
You're right.

974
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,500
- That's incredible.
- Now,

975
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,640
the last person
to sleep indoors is...

976
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,870
Cho Sae Ho.

977
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,410
(The last person
to sleep indoors is Sae Ho.)

978
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,310
- Good for him.
- It's three of us again.

979
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,280
(Automatically,
these three will sleep outdoors.)

980
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,580
(The winners celebrate
their victory.)

981
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,610
(Making a cute sound)

982
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,950
Goodness.

983
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,890
Everyone, well done today.

984
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,360
- Thank you.
- When you hear the wake-up song,

985
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,790
- come to the backyard.
- Where's the backyard?

986
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,630
- We were there a moment ago.
- I see.

987
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,690
Okay.

988
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,030
- Well done.
- See you tomorrow morning.

989
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,670
- Well done.
- Well done, everyone.

990
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,870
Thank you for your hard work.

991
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,470
- Worker.
- Yes, sir.

992
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,440
- Set up the bed.
- Okay.

993
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,610
Clean up the inside.

994
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,670
Clean up outside first.

995
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,780
(The workers' day isn't over yet.)

996
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,350
(The workers are tidying up
the bedding.)

997
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,850
(On the other hand)

998
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,220
(What? There isn't
even a sleeping bag.)

999
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,290
Worker? Mister?

1000
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,620
(Where are all the workers?)

1001
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,590
- Mr. Worker.
- Yes?

1002
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,960
Hurry up and put the sleeping bags
inside the tent.

1003
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,300
You should be working.

1004
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,240
Why are you holding your phone?
No one is calling you.

1005
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,470
- Let's try it.
- Okay.

1006
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,840
Set it up for the eldest first.

1007
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,510
(Doing it carelessly)

1008
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,640
Spread it out.

1009
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,040
Spread out the sleeping bag.

1010
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
(You'd better do it properly.)

1011
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,780
Make it neat like at a hotel.

1012
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,350
Toward the end.

1013
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,280
Do it well.

1014
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,490
It's too close to the tent.

1015
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,760
- Hurry. Set it up for me first.
- That should do it.

1016
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,020
(It's not easy being a worker.)

1017
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,320
Do mine first.

1018
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,460
(Do mine first.
I'm the young master.)

1019
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,060
- I'll throw it to you.
- Okay.

1020
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,100
(He's being forced to work hard.)

1021
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,670
Set up my bed first.

1022
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,400
(What else should I put in?)

1023
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,970
Put this inside too.

1024
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,870
What for?

1025
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,940
Put it in for now.

1026
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,240
(I can't believe
you're making me do this too.)

1027
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,540
Don't put it on my sleeping bag.
Put it to the side.

1028
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
(Don't put it next to me
because there's no space.)

1029
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:34,910
It's all done.

1030
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,510
(He finally finishes
setting up the tent.)

1031
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,880
I already finished everything.

1032
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,520
I was pooping.

1033
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,050
(Worker 2 was absent
because he was in the bathroom.)

1034
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,120
Did you poop?

1035
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,690
- Seon Ho, hurry and grab this.
- Okay.

1036
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,790
- What should I do?
- Hurry up.

1037
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,290
Set up the mosquito net.

1038
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,460
It's all done.

1039
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,060
- Well done.
- Sleep well.

1040
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,130
Good night.

1041
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,230
- We'll go and wash up.
- No way.

1042
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,200
- What?
- I'm going to wash up now.

1043
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,930
(The young master
hasn't washed up yet.)

1044
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,170
(The unfair hierarchical society)

1045
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,110
- The ones who used to be workers...
- Right.

1046
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,670
become more ruthless
after they go up the rank.

1047
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,280
(The 1st generation worker
who's ruthless)

1048
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,310
(Darn it)

1049
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,150
Clean up the mess again.

1050
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,020
Do it.

1051
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,020
(My life is terrible.)

1052
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,060
Joon, which one do you want?
Pig, puppy, or penguin.

1053
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,660
(I choose penguin.)

1054
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,160
- Fox or tiger.
- I want the tiger.

1055
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,800
What about you, Joon?

1056
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,030
(I like it.)

1057
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,770
(DinDin takes care of his skin
like Sae Ho.)

1058
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,640
(Those sleeping indoors are
relaxed.)

1059
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,110
(No Longer Workers, Sleeping Inside,
Happy Country Vacation)

1060
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,470
Who are the workers?

1061
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,010
Workers.

1062
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,510
Workers.

1063
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,520
There are no workers.
Where are they?

1064
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,920
(The workers are washing up.)

1065
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,350
As the former worker,
you should turn off the lights.

1066
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,350
(This won't do.)

1067
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,990
- I'm no longer who I used to be.
- You were a worker.

1068
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,020
Turn off the lights.

1069
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,390
- Turn them off as our colleague.
- Okay.

1070
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,460
I'm not a worker anymore.

1071
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,430
Lee Joon, your colleague.

1072
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,300
- I'll turn off the lights.
- Okay.

1073
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,700
One, two, three.

1074
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,140
- Sleep well.
- As expected.

1075
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,770
You're good at it
because you're experienced.

1076
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,240
- Today's shoot was easy.
- It was easy only for you.

1077
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,440
Today, I was really...

1078
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,010
DinDin and I didn't lose
in any game today.

1079
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,780
- Didn't we win everything today?
- Yes.

1080
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,580
- That worker.
- Hey, worker.

1081
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,950
Didn't we win everything today?

1082
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,220
(The youngest worker appears
from the darkness.)

1083
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,190
- Turn off the light.
- Do I have to?

1084
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,290
Hey, how old are you?

1085
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,330
I'm 24.

1086
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,530
I'm 38.

1087
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,330
Hey, I'm 44. Turn off the light.

1088
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,330
Turn which light off?

1089
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,700
- Hey, worker.
- Yes?

1090
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,070
Can you sing us a lullaby?

1091
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,070
- That's right.
- What's your song request?

1092
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,080
(Workers' list of things to do:
Singing a lullaby to young masters)

1093
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,110
That's nice.

1094
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,420
- It's not fun. You're dismissed.
- Good night.

1095
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,990
- Hey, worker.
- Yes?

1096
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,320
- Sleep well.
- Hey, worker.

1097
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,220
You'd better come
when we call you at night.

1098
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,490
I'll come right over.

1099
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,660
(I'll come right over.)

1100
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,290
It's really nice
to have workers around.

1101
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,870
(The morning during
Country Vacation arrives quickly.)

1102
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,240
(In the silence, we only hear
Se Yoon's snoring.)

1103
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,610
(The perfect wake-up song
for Country Vacation)

1104
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,910
(Today's wake-up song,
"Kko-Kki-Oh" by Kim Jang Hoon)

1105
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:26,950
(The young masters get up slowly.)

1106
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,950
Gosh, good morning.

1107
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,720
(Sae Ho is the 1st one to get up.)

1108
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,990
(He's still half asleep
this morning.)

1109
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,630
Yesterday,

1110
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,130
I was trained
by that personal trainer.

1111
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,130
- Your whole body?
- My whole body is aching.

1112
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,500
He's an amazing personal trainer.

1113
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,530
(He's the top trainer.)

1114
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,340
When I was sleeping,
the rooster crowed...

1115
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,970
once every two seconds.

1116
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,740
Then it was followed by the song.

1117
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,650
"Kko-Kki-Oh!"

1118
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,520
- We're playing table tennis again.
- What's this?

1119
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,580
I don't think
that we're playing table tennis.

1120
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,790
- Something is up.
- There's no net.

1121
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,520
Everyone, your Country Vacation is
coming to an end.

1122
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,520
Every trip ends with cleaning up.

1123
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,230
That sounds tiring.

1124
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,330
Today, you'll play
the last worker game.

1125
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,670
The top four players
will get off work right away.

1126
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,830
The bottom two will stay behind...

1127
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,900
and clean up everything
before getting off work.

1128
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,240
- That's the worst.
- We have to pack up the tent too?

1129
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,710
Taking down the tent is very hard.

1130
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,880
I don't want to be a slave.

1131
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,810
I hated being a worker.

1132
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,180
Being a worker is very difficult.

1133
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,310
Guys, the rule is very simple.

1134
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,780
Pick a toy car of your choice
and send it...

1135
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,490
as close to the end of
the table tennis table as possible.

1136
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,120
The four who are closest
to the line will win.

1137
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,490
Your toy car must pass this line
to be accepted.

1138
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,630
- This line?
- Yes.

1139
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
Can we practice?

1140
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,060
(A quick practice time)

1141
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,330
Let's see.

1142
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,100
(Joon)

1143
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
That's very close.

1144
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,770
(Feeling proud)

1145
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,740
People like him are bound to fail
during the real game.

1146
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,540
You get eliminated
when the toy car falls off.

1147
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,680
Do you need help?

1148
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,310
(Sae Ho)

1149
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,520
(Jolting)

1150
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,780
(It stops right in front
of the base line.)

1151
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,220
That was the worst.
Did you see that?

1152
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,760
It made a sharp turn
to eliminate me.

1153
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,060
Sae Ho, you seem a little off.

1154
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,730
- Let's start now.
- Let's do it.

1155
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,160
- Let's do it.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1156
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,070
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors. Okay.

1157
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,170
- My goodness.
- The wheels are...

1158
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,440
As you know, Se Yoon
always gets lost when he's driving.

1159
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,970
- Oh, right.
- His car will definitely turn.

1160
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,310
He's bad with directions.

1161
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,380
This is nerve-racking.

1162
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,540
(Nervous)

1163
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,050
It starts as soon as you let it go.

1164
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,710
Okay, here I go.

1165
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,180
Kko-Kki-Oh.

1166
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,690
There it goes.

1167
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,920
(It passes the base line.)

1168
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,260
(Please)

1169
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,160
(Whoosh)

1170
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,160
(It fell off.)

1171
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,930
(In despair)

1172
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,500
- There it goes.
- There it goes.

1173
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,570
(His prediction was spot on.)

1174
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,730
(Acting annoying)

1175
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,770
- Moon Se Yoon.
- I'm so happy.

1176
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,070
He's happy.

1177
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,470
How many people get to win?

1178
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,940
- Two?
- Four people.

1179
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,270
Four people get to win,
but you're out.

1180
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,380
- Really?
- You're totally eliminated.

1181
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,710
- We don't know yet.
- Four people's cars could fall off.

1182
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,080
It has to pass this line, right?

1183
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,720
You don't know for sure either.

1184
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
(Carefully getting ready to start)

1185
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,250
You're thinking too much.

1186
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,420
Okay.

1187
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,220
(Departing)

1188
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,790
Just...

1189
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,800
(It stops after advancing a little.)

1190
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,430
(What?)

1191
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,230
(The probability of getting off work
just increased.)

1192
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,500
(Let's try to go home.)

1193
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,340
At least I was daring.

1194
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,940
- Oh, no.
- I was courageous,

1195
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,140
but you were worse than me.

1196
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,640
My goodness.

1197
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,980
(We had a bad feeling about him.)

1198
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,250
- He was thinking too much.
- That was the worst.

1199
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,320
He had too many thoughts
in his head.

1200
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,780
Here I go.

1201
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
(Starting immediately
without hesitating)

1202
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,150
- Goodness.
- What?

1203
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,790
(It's faster than he expected.)

1204
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,660
(What will be the result?)

1205
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
It's out.

1206
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,160
(Jong Min)

1207
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,930
(It stopped in the safe zone.)

1208
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,230
It's out.

1209
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,940
(Roaring with joy)

1210
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,470
How did it...

1211
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,710
(I thought that it'd fall off.)

1212
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,770
It should've fallen off.

1213
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,910
Because the toy car is small...

1214
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,280
I also considered the bump.

1215
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,850
I considered all the factors.

1216
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,850
(The most likely candidates
for workers for now)

1217
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,610
(Joon is up next.)

1218
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,980
You have to pull it harder
than you think.

1219
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,980
(Giving advice regretfully)

1220
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,990
- You should pull it more.
- You need to pull it a lot more.

1221
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,790
What's with you
so early in the morning?

1222
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,460
(Nervous)

1223
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,560
- You should pull it more.
- You need to pull it a lot more.

1224
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,400
(He must be planning to send it safely
without crashing.)

1225
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
Pull it more.
(Will it be a good choice?)

1226
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,700
A slope appeared.

1227
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,270
What's going on? Hey.

1228
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,470
A slope appeared.

1229
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,910
(Falling off)

1230
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,540
(He completely failed
due to a sharp turn.)

1231
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,850
Sae Ho, we have a chance now.
Don't we have a chance?

1232
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,980
- We have a chance. Okay.
- Goodness.

1233
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,020
(A disaster caused by a bad choice)

1234
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,220
I just need to send it safely.

1235
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,620
It won't work if you think too much.

1236
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,920
- I just have to pass the line.
- Keep it close to the end.

1237
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,360
I just have to pass the line.

1238
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,560
(He'll get off work
if his car passes the base line.)

1239
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,730
I'm so nervous.

1240
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,530
DinDin, it will happen
in the blink of an eye.

1241
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,500
- Please don't let him pass it.
- It will definitely fall off.

1242
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,600
(He starts.)

1243
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,170
(DinDin)

1244
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,600
(DinDin will get off work.)

1245
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,970
Kko-Kki-Oh!

1246
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,280
Okay, let's go.

1247
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,780
You've been lucky since yesterday.

1248
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,510
He hasn't done anything
since yesterday.

1249
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,880
This is a free party.

1250
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,580
That's impressive.

1251
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,250
(It's Seon Ho's turn.)

1252
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,120
(I'm so nervous.)

1253
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,320
As long as it goes beyond this line,

1254
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,490
- you'll get to rest.
- Yoo Seon Ho.

1255
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,790
Here I go.

1256
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,130
You have to pull it harder
than you think.

1257
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,760
(Starting)

1258
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,430
(It suddenly changes the direction
toward the cliff.)

1259
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,470
(A sudden stop)

1260
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,910
(Seon Ho)

1261
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,780
(It stops dramatically
right before falling off.)

1262
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,980
(That was such a close call.)

1263
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,640
- Kko, kko, kko.
- Kko-Kki-Oh.

1264
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,150
(Disappointed)

1265
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,710
The three of us are safe.

1266
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,750
Are we safe?

1267
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,420
- Really?
- You three will get off work.

1268
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,020
- Yes!
- Kko-Kki-Oh.

1269
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,120
Thank you.
Only one of you will survive.

1270
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,190
- It's 1 of the 3.
- Only 1 of you will survive.

1271
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,660
Do you want some advice?

1272
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,030
Yes, please.

1273
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,360
Imagine a line.

1274
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,070
Pull it until that line
and release it.

1275
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,470
- Everyone is doing that.
- That's right.

1276
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,640
You thought that
we were doing it thoughtlessly?

1277
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,970
You've been stating the obvious
since yesterday.

1278
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,240
They must be very nervous.
It will be one of them.

1279
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,280
- Wait.
- Keep the area clear.

1280
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,980
I bet Joon's car will go...

1281
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,480
(He predicts another fall.)

1282
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,250
- Pull harder than you think.
- It doesn't seem hard enough.

1283
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,050
You have to consider the slope too.

1284
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,350
It's not touching the line.

1285
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,550
(Starting)

1286
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,650
It's not touching the line.

1287
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,790
He did a good job.

1288
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,490
(Joon)

1289
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,630
(This time, it stops safely.)

1290
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,100
- Not bad.
- It's ambiguous.

1291
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,060
- I just need to hit his car.
- Right.

1292
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,770
If I hit it accurately,
his car could fall off.

1293
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:50,970
Or both of your cars could fall off.

1294
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,300
- Is this possible?
- It's possible.

1295
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,870
Are you trying to hit his car?

1296
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,970
Since Joon's car is light,
it could cause a major accident.

1297
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,640
- You just need to push it a little.
- Let's try it.

1298
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,110
- Please play fairly.
- I will push Joon's car.

1299
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,110
(Will he succeed?)

1300
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,280
(He starts.)

1301
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,210
(Approaching)

1302
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,780
(Charging forward)

1303
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,250
(It fails to crash
due to the change of direction.)

1304
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,560
(He still did better than Joon.)

1305
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,690
(Proud)

1306
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:19,400
- No.
- But he...

1307
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,100
(The last player is Se Yoon.)

1308
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,160
This would be the best scenario.

1309
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,930
- There are two cars ahead.
- Hitting them both?

1310
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,000
- If I send them off like curling...
- After making them fall off,

1311
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,100
your car stops.

1312
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,640
- That'd be amazing.
- Amazing.

1313
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,740
This is what I'll do.

1314
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,840
- I'll brush against Joon's car.
- Brush against this?

1315
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,010
After lightly brushing against it,
I'll hit...

1316
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,810
- that car head-on from the back.
- Okay.

1317
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:37,850
Sae Ho's car.

1318
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,450
(He plans to hit it head-on
to make it fall off.)

1319
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,920
I'll give him credit if he makes it.

1320
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,450
Isn't that right?
This is a game after all.

1321
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,790
- Why are you starting on the side?
- What?

1322
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,220
This car is on the line.

1323
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,860
I slightly turned the wheels.

1324
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,530
(Laughing)

1325
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,860
He's getting angry at you.

1326
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,100
You talk too much.

1327
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,700
I'm sorry.

1328
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,030
Let's try it.

1329
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:57,670
(Will he get off work or work?
What will be Se Yoon's fate?)

1330
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,400
(Extremely nervous)

1331
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,670
He's pulling it very far.

1332
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:04,710
This is too far.

1333
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,810
My car will also fall off
at this rate.

1334
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,410
I feel like I'm in "Squid Game."

1335
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,450
I'm serious.

1336
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,080
I agree. That's what it feels like.

1337
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,320
It's very intense.

1338
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,220
(Fatty Ki Hoon is about to cry
due to too much pressure.)

1339
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:21,760
I'm sorry. I'll go first.

1340
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,660
(Who will be the last one
to get off work?)

1341
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,960
This is making me nervous.

1342
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,200
It won't be easy.

1343
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,270
(Fatty Car finally leaves
Se Yoon's hands.)

1344
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,200
(Please...)

1345
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,170
- Goodness.
- What's going on?

1346
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,470
(It falls off.)

1347
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,240
(It goes off
in a ridiculous direction.)

1348
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,310
(Stunned)

1349
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,880
I thought that it'd turn here.

1350
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,680
I told you out of worry.

1351
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:46,820
What did I tell you?

1352
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,220
Considering his long preparation,
it turned out so boring.

1353
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,520
It couldn't be helped.

1354
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,320
If his car hadn't fallen off...

1355
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,990
The four of you can get off work
right away.

1356
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,660
Really? Can we really go home now?

1357
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,600
- Se Yoon and Joon.
- Goodness.

1358
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,760
Put your vest back on
from yesterday and work.

1359
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,830
"From yesterday?"

1360
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,600
You wore them yesterday.

1361
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,600
(Giving back the worker uniform)

1362
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,300
Se Yoon, yours is
still slightly wet.

1363
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,940
You don't need to tell me that.

1364
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,210
(Snapping)

1365
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,840
I ate so well
and had a lot of fun this week.

1366
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1367
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,350
Thank you.

1368
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,650
That's it for
Our Own Country Vacation.

1369
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,150
Well done, everyone.

1370
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,620
Seriously?

1371
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,960
- It was really amazing.
- This is moving.

1372
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,390
Why are you still here? Get lost.

1373
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,760
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

1374
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,960
- Hurry up.
- You're being harsh.

1375
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,960
Hurry up and go home.

1376
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,670
- We're leaving.
- We're really leaving.

1377
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,170
- Have some food before you go.
- Bye.

1378
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,600
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

1379
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,810
I was lucky during this shoot.

1380
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:47,110
(No experience as a worker
during Country Vacation)

1381
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,980
Thank you.

1382
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,010
(Without the worker experience,
he leaves while giving hearts.)

1383
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,150
Thank you for your work.

1384
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,620
(The two workers remain.)

1385
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,420
We need to take these out first.

1386
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,760
(Dismantling the tent)

1387
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,860
Things that are inside.

1388
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,060
(He starts by tidying up
the sleeping bags.)

1389
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,000
Goodness, this is
where the workers slept.

1390
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,070
Shouldn't they feed us
before we work?

1391
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:12,770
(Sighing)

1392
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,270
(Grunting)

1393
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,010
(The cleanup scene is filled
with sighs.)

1394
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,580
We keep working together
during this trip.

1395
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,250
(They were also selected
as workers yesterday.)

1396
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,310
Right?

1397
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,920
Maybe we're compatible
according to our saju.

1398
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,620
- Why do we keep working together?
- That must be the case.

1399
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,390
Gosh, this is wonderful.

1400
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,660
(Enjoying food from the food truck
instead of going home)

1401
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,860
This is nice.

1402
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,500
(Do you hear me, workers?)

1403
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,400
You must be in such a good mood
to talk so loudly.

1404
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,330
- Workers!
- Workers!

1405
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,440
(We're eating.)

1406
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,540
What is it?

1407
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:50,070
We don't need to...

1408
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,410
- Don't act like you know us.
- respond, do we?

1409
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,810
Enjoy your food and leave.

1410
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,710
Go away.

1411
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,210
There are pink sausages.

1412
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,080
This is nice.

1413
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,020
They have pink sausages.

1414
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,060
(Cleaning up with anger)

1415
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,260
Are you okay? What's wrong with you
all of a sudden?

1416
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,370
Mister, you're scaring me.
What's wrong?

1417
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,800
We can do this quickly.

1418
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,070
(Furious worker)

1419
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,210
(The provocateur reappears
right when you start to forget him.)

1420
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,970
- Are you working?
- Listen.

1421
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,580
- You can't eat here.
- Why not?

1422
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,510
- Food from outside is prohibited.
- I'm sorry.

1423
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,210
- But the broth is so good.
- I can see that.

1424
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,780
Why is it all over your mouth?

1425
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,650
(An eating performance)

1426
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:39,290
Don't you want some?

1427
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,420
(Seon Ho also comes
to provoke them.)

1428
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,490
This is so good.

1429
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,490
(Uncomfortable)

1430
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:46,260
- The food is delicious.
- You workers should definitely eat.

1431
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,930
- Don't worry about us.
- Okay. It's so delicious.

1432
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,370
Se Yoon, the broth is to die for.

1433
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:53,500
Go away before I kill you.

1434
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,970
- Let's go.
- See you.

1435
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:57,940
I shouldn't have pooped.
I'm so hungry.

1436
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,940
(Cleaning everywhere
while fighting against hunger)

1437
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,710
(The base camp turns spotless.)

1438
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,150
- We're done.
- Thank you for your work.

1439
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,550
(2 Days and 1 Night)

1440
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,390
(Jong Min is on his honeymoon.)

1441
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,290
(The endless stretch
of the blue sea)

1442
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,930
(A vast field where you can feel
the freshness of summer)

1443
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,670
Look at this barley field.

1444
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,930
(Where is today's destination
with a beautiful view of nature?)

1445
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,040
The barley field looks stunning.

1446
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,000
This is where they shoot
beer commercials.

1447
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,070
You're right.

1448
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,640
- This place is beautiful.
- Look at the barley.

1449
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,480
There isn't just mud in Boryeong.

1450
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,850
DinDin, did you run 20km
for the marathon?

1451
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,580
- Twenty kilometers?
- Or was it ten kilometers?

1452
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,150
- Show us your run.
- Show us.

1453
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,920
(They're all running
through the barley field.)

1454
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,460
(Making it more energetic
from the start)

1455
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

1456
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,600
(The beginner runners are
running carelessly.)

1457
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,830
- Hello.
- Look at you run.

1458
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:58,600
You can run now.

1459
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,740
Can you run?

1460
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,940
After that day, Se Yoon bought
a pair of running shoes.

1461
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,140
- Really?
- Yes.

1462
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,470
(After being taught by
the instructor with sunglasses)

1463
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,640
(Se Yoon got into running.)

1464
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,310
- I can do anything.
- That's great.

1465
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,450
My goodness.

1466
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,650
It looks like...

1467
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,450
you lost about one-third
of your family.

1468
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,420
- Where did everyone go?
- Where did everyone go?

1469
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,890
- They're with Jong Min...
- They went with him.

1470
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:20,890
- on his honeymoon.
- Really?

1471
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,590
- They went with him.
- The staff became very small.

1472
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:23,590
(That sounds fun.)

1473
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:26,460
I saw photos that Jong Min uploaded
to our chat room.

1474
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:29,060
Jong Min put the images together
using chroma key.

1475
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,970
In my opinion,
he's in the German Village in Korea.

1476
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:34,200
(This is not in Korea.)

1477
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,440
(Jong Min is enjoying
his honeymoon.)

1478
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,880
With the Eiffel Tower
in the background,

1479
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,550
he was drinking coffee and wine
in the photo.

1480
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:44,580
It looked so fake.

1481
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,150
- It looked so 2 Days and 1 Night.
- I agree.

1482
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,120
- It looked like...
- It didn't seem real.

1483
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,920
he took the photo
in front of a wallpaper.

1484
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,590
It was so 2 Days and 1 Night.
It was hilarious.

1485
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,590
(Jong Min is simply 2 Days and 1 Night.)

1486
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,730
- Jong Min isn't here with us today.
- Right.

1487
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,600
I also read it in an article
that we won't have guests either.

1488
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,830
- Right.
- I'm sure there are.

1489
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:04,900
- Why...
- Seriously?

1490
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,540
Why didn't you invite anyone
as a guest?

1491
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,240
I bet Jong Min asked him
not to invite anyone.

1492
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,600
Did he ask him not to?

1493
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,910
That's possible.
So that he can come back.

1494
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:12,910
Right.

1495
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:15,640
What if you realize that it looks better
with just the five of us?

1496
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,280
- Then what will you do?
- Will we continue like this?

1497
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,050
- We'll have to discuss.
- Right.

1498
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,720
- "Discuss?"
- It'll be a chance to save money.

1499
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,050
As someone who has missed the show
due to my honeymoon,

1500
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,120
it does feel anxious.

1501
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,890
"What if it's more entertaining
without me?"

1502
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:28,160
I relate to that story too.

1503
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,730
I also missed the show once
because I didn't feel well.

1504
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,130
That week, the show hit
the highest viewers' ratings.

1505
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,730
That week marked
the highest viewers' ratings ever.

1506
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,570
So it made me think a lot.
It almost made me feel worse.

1507
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,900
(An unforgettable,
yet hurtful memory)

1508
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,000
He would have just stood still...

1509
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,400
even if he was here.

1510
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,010
- You're right.
- Everyone's feeling well.

1511
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:46,010
He would have done that.

1512
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,410
- It didn't go that far.
- He might hear this. I'm scared.

1513
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,410
(Have a nice honeymoon.)

1514
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,510
- But this is what worries me.
- Yes?

1515
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,280
- When Jong Min is not here,
- Yes?

1516
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,150
I hope we can film something
that is calm and refreshing.

1517
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,920
- I heard that today would be tough.
- I heard a crazy rumor about it.

1518
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,460
- The staff apologized in advance.
- They said the same thing to me.

1519
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,330
- Right.
- They told me yesterday.

1520
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,060
- I got a text from them.
- You all got it, right?

1521
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,130
- Yes.
- They said sorry.

1522
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,030
What did you mean by that?
Why would you do something bad?

1523
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,000
They checked up on my lymph nodes...

1524
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,300
more than my doctor.

1525
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,440
"Hello, this is Director Joo.
Are your lymph nodes okay?"

1526
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,670
- Sae Ho.
- Yes?

1527
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:20,380
- You've been to Bali recently.
- Yes, I have.

1528
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,110
Did you swim or not?

1529
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,650
I'll explain.

1530
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,910
Did you swim? Yes or no?

1531
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:28,050
- I did get into the water.
- You did?

1532
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,050
- Oh, no.
- I mean...

1533
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,950
I got into the water
because you couldn't.

1534
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,120
(They picked a man...)

1535
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,060
(who would go into the water
on behalf of Sae Ho.)

1536
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:37,930
(Seon Ho was selected
as Substitute Man.)

1537
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:41,560
(Although the weather was chilly,)

1538
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,870
(he got into the water
on behalf of Sae Ho.)

1539
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:46,470
I was sick until last week.
I'm not kidding.

1540
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,240
- Look at him.
- Come on.

1541
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,940
- He got skinnier.
- I mean...

1542
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,570
If you were to
just walk into the water...

1543
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,410
- I know.
- The sea is much better.

1544
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:54,540
- He's right.
- You can disinfect with salt too.

1545
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,810
I can get into the sea now.

1546
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,450
(It has been a month.
He can get into the sea.)

1547
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,850
I was sick for three weeks.
I had diarrhea until last week.

1548
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:01,850
What happened?

1549
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,420
That has nothing to do with it.
I'm sure you ate something bad.

1550
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,050
No. I was sick from the next day.

1551
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,390
Who gets enteritis after getting
into the seawater?

1552
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,960
That makes no sense.

1553
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,830
It does make you sick
if you drink the seawater.

1554
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,760
Something got into my mouth.

1555
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,600
After hearing his story,
you were also wrong.

1556
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,500
You were sick anyway.

1557
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,270
Sae Ho didn't make you
get enteritis.

1558
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,070
I love how this conversation
is going.

1559
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,770
Today, the five of you
will show great teamwork.

1560
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,740
- You'll travel on your own.
- So it's true.

1561
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,580
- You mean the five of us together?
- Yes.

1562
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,010
Since Jong Min isn't here,

1563
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:33,280
Se Yoon and Sae Ho
are the big brothers now.

1564
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,020
Isn't your birthday later than mine?

1565
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,020
- I was born in August.
- When was I born?

1566
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,960
- April?
- May 11.

1567
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:42,120
You know the audio director...

1568
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,730
He put the microphone on me
and said this.

1569
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,360
It was as if I were going on a war.

1570
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,630
He looked at me
as if I were a general.

1571
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,300
"You're getting
Microphone One today."

1572
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,100
You're getting Microphone One today.

1573
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,600
I didn't know I was going to wear
Microphone One.

1574
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:57,170
I'll remember this.

1575
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,310
- So when's your birthday?
- So is he older than me?

1576
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,340
It has to go by age.

1577
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:01,810
I'm wearing Microphone One.

1578
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,140
I got Microphone One.

1579
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,010
I'm the man of 2 Days and 1 Night!

1580
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,380
(You heard that, youngsters?)

1581
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:07,750
(Laughing)

1582
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:10,920
(Nobody's going along with
the interim big brother's joke.)

1583
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,750
He's somewhat dictatorial.

1584
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:16,420
- He needs someone above him.
- You're right.

1585
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:18,260
Why isn't Chorong here?

1586
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,360
(I miss you, Chorong.)

1587
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,800
- You'll begin your journey now.
- Let's hear the concept.

1588
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,060
Today's destination is...

1589
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:25,470
(Mecca of activities)

1590
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,770
(A refreshing destination
for summer)

1591
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:30,740
Boryeong and Buyeo of
South Chungcheong Province.

1592
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,910
- Buyeo.
- Boryeong and Buyeo.

1593
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:32,910
We're traveling all the way
to Buyeo?

1594
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,780
In May, the green barley field...

1595
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,980
- It's beautiful.
- turns into gold.

1596
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,980
(The green field of spring
turns into gold.)

1597
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,750
It's Cheonbuk Barley Field.

1598
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:42,920
- Cheonbuk?
- Yes.

1599
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:47,060
You've been on comfortable trips
for the last few weeks.

1600
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,890
- What are you talking about?
- We didn't ask for it.

1601
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,890
We were workers too.
It wasn't that comfortable.

1602
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,130
- Right.
- Who says it was comfortable?

1603
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,830
So for this journey,

1604
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:57,370
we're trying to go back
to the basic spirit of the show.

1605
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:58,500
- The basic spirit?
- Yes.

1606
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,540
- What is it?
- The real wild road variety spirit.

1607
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,340
- Real wild road variety?
- That's right.

1608
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:06,810
But the man who lived his life
for 18 years without that spirit.

1609
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,310
Shouldn't he be the one here?

1610
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,180
We still have the spirit,
but not him.

1611
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,110
So today's concept is...

1612
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,720
- Bivouac Race.
- What's Bivouac?

1613
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,220
- It means sleeping outdoors.
- What it means is...

1614
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,420
Bivouac Race?

1615
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:21,420
Did you know that Bivouac is German?

1616
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,790
- Bivouac?
- Bivouac.

1617
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,260
That's right. It's Bivouac.

1618
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,260
- So it's true.
- Yes.

1619
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,500
- Bivouac?
- Bivouac.

1620
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,000
Did you major in German?

1621
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,130
- No.
- You pronounce it very well.

1622
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,400
I heard it a few times.

1623
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,400
(Feeling proud)

1624
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,070
You spend a night
with minimal equipment...

1625
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:37,940
- without building a tent.
- Come on.

1626
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,540
With minimal equipment?

1627
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,140
But we have tents.
Why do we have to go bivouac?

1628
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,640
Isn't our tent the bare minimum
of equipment?

1629
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,650
- We have it.
- And why do you do this...

1630
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,050
- when Jong Min isn't here?
- I know.

1631
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,150
- He should be...
- Why would you make him lucky?

1632
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:51,590
Let's smile.

1633
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,320
Let's smile.

1634
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,660
- Seriously.
- You can see that?

1635
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,490
- You can? All right.
- Smile a little.

1636
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,900
- So, today, you will...
- Yes.

1637
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,870
sleep in nature
with the sky as your blanket.

1638
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,100
(A day to sleep with nature
using the night sky as a blanket)

1639
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,700
We can't make you sleep
on the ground.

1640
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,640
You will get
the minimum equipment...

1641
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,110
for you to spend the night outside
with your talent.

1642
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,050
So we get nothing
if we're not talented.

1643
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,210
That could be true.

1644
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,310
(So there's a chance
we get nothing?)

1645
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,580
You can get items one by one...

1646
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,990
by completing Bivouac Race missions.

1647
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:25,290
So we get one by one.

1648
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,990
Why don't we just sleep
in the barley field?

1649
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:28,990
Let's do that.

1650
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,130
- Right, it means nothing.
- It doesn't mean anything.

1651
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,690
I think we can just sleep here.

1652
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:33,700
It will be different.

1653
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,700
But the temperature at night
these days...

1654
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,770
It drops to somewhere 18°C to 21°C
at night.

1655
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:40,940
That means we can sleep.

1656
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,840
I slept with my windows open
last night.

1657
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,410
It was breezy and nice.
We can sleep well.

1658
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:45,870
- You did?
- Yes.

1659
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,940
- I could have diarrhea.
- What did you say?

1660
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,480
- I could have diarrhea.
- It has nothing to do with that.

1661
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,380
You should go to the hospital now.

1662
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,550
You had diarrhea since last week!

1663
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:56,890
- How can you have it for two weeks?
- He went to two hospitals.

1664
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,290
That has nothing to do
with your diarrhea.

1665
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,960
You get a stomachache
only when you eat something bad.

1666
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,660
- Something got into my mouth.
- You just got into the water.

1667
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,830
Why would you have a stomachache?

1668
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:06,690
(Don't just eat anything today.)

1669
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:07,700
- Then...
- I'll just hold it.

1670
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,930
Let's set off for our trip.

1671
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,470
All right. Are we getting on a van?

1672
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:14,770
- Yes, you'll get on a van.
- You'll provide it for us?

1673
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,040
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1674
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:20,940
Let's shoot a real, wild,
road variety show without Jong Min.

1675
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,080
They might only use that episode
from now on.

1676
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,950
(You don't know what might happen.)

1677
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,850
It's somewhere between bivouac
and sleeping in the open.

1678
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,820
What will happen to us?

1679
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,750
Korea's real...

1680
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,220
Bivouac variety.

1681
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,830
Who are we?

1682
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,190
2 Days...

1683
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,990
- And 1 Night.
- And 1 Night.

1684
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,000
Hold on. I'm the eldest today.

1685
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,430
So I must sit here.

1686
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:48,270
This seat is for the eldest.

1687
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,640
(Jong Min's usual seat)

1688
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:54,740
(Se Yoon had to sit
in the narrow couple's seat.)

1689
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,310
This is where the eldest sits.

1690
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,110
(He's just happy to be the eldest.)

1691
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:01,150
You must be happy to be the eldest.

1692
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,250
It feels different, right?

1693
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,490
- Well...
- He likes having titles.

1694
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:05,990
No, it's not that.

1695
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,290
I just sat here
so that you have more space.

1696
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:10,660
- Really? That's so thoughtful.
- It's more comfortable, yes?

1697
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,660
Of course.

1698
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,530
(On their way to get
bivouac supplies)

1699
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:16,500
It feels empty without Jong Min.

1700
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:18,930
Did you all get a call from him?

1701
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,740
- Yes, in a group chat.
- We...

1702
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,640
- We texted him yesterday.
- Right.

1703
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,310
I thought he would be busy.

1704
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,310
Of course, he's on his honeymoon.

1705
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,810
He showed me his honeymoon schedule.

1706
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:31,010
It seemed as busy
as an election campaign.

1707
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,650
He had more than four pages
of his notes.

1708
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:35,880
But I understand
why it had to be tight.

1709
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,350
This must be
what Jong Min's wife thinks.

1710
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,020
When would she ever go
on a long trip with him if not now?

1711
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,090
- Right.
- She's very thorough.

1712
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:43,260
- Right.
- She's delicate.

1713
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:46,530
- Jong Min needs someone like her.
- Right.

1714
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,430
(We wish you
a lifetime of happiness.)

1715
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,060
Where are we headed?

1716
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,470
We're going on a real road trip.

1717
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,140
- Really?
- A real road?

1718
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,110
You should have asked us...

1719
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:59,270
to come naked with just boxers on.

1720
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:00,280
- I know.
- I'm sorry, but...

1721
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,080
Just drop us at some mountain.

1722
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,140
(Please drop us at some wild spot.)

1723
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,350
We can do that next time.

1724
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:06,580
- Come on.
- What are you saying?

1725
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:10,120
We're going to Boryeong,
South Chungcheong Province.

1726
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,890
- It's all mudflat.
- Mudflat.

1727
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:15,020
Going back to the real wild road
variety show means...

1728
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,620
- we're going to the mudflat.
- Right.

1729
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,760
We'll go there for sure.

1730
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,760
I don't think they're leading us...

1731
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,860
to some mudflat this time.

1732
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:23,930
Mudflat...

1733
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:26,570
- But I think...
- "To some mudflat..."

1734
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,140
(He's calm all of a sudden.)

1735
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,840
We're headed somewhere
that's far from the city.

1736
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,870
It feels somewhat ominous.

1737
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:34,040
I don't see anything much.

1738
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,140
Will you provide us with meals?

1739
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,150
- Which one?
- Meals...

1740
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:40,820
It depends on how well
you earn your items.

1741
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:43,120
I think you will put us in a cage...

1742
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,520
with just one portion of food.

1743
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,520
(Isn't this about food fight?)

1744
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,090
Isn't real wild variety show
all about that?

1745
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:49,090
We steal food and all that.

1746
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,990
- Hold on. A trail entrance?
- A trail entrance?

1747
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,860
(Are they hiking
from the first day?)

1748
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,930
Smile. You have to keep smiling.

1749
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:59,370
- Are we walking up?
- The true variety show...

1750
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:01,140
- has finally started.
- Yes, let's smile.

1751
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,240
(Is their first bivouac course hiking?)

1752
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,540
- Let's smile.
- Let's make it cheerful.

1753
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:05,840
I started running these days.

1754
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,280
I do want to run up the mountains.

1755
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:10,080
There's trail running,
which is running up the mountain.

1756
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,080
Right, it's nice.

1757
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,910
I've wanted to run up a mountain
since I started running.

1758
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:15,280
If you go hiking anytime soon,

1759
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,190
- you'll fall in love with it.
- I know.

1760
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,020
- What's this?
- What is it?

1761
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,620
Light aviation? What's that?

1762
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,660
- What is it?
- Is this for real?

1763
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,020
I see a plane.

1764
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,030
- Is it paragliding?
- Why is there a plane?

1765
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:26,860
- Are we jumping off?
- Is it skydiving?

1766
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,630
- Skydiving?
- No, come on.

1767
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,200
I tried it once. It will kill you.

1768
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:33,300
- Skydiving?
- You will die.

1769
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:34,940
Today, it's all about real variety.

1770
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:38,070
- What's real?
- What on earth is this?

1771
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:41,210
- This isn't real!
- You haven't told us about this.

1772
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,280
What is this?

1773
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,110
This is neither wild nor real.
It's just one of the activities.

1774
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,580
You will die if you get on it.

1775
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,720
I'm not good with it.

1776
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,720
(What's waiting for them here?)

1777
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,950
Are you scared?

1778
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,620
(Getting off, feeling anxious)

1779
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,490
Real, wild.

1780
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,290
This is exactly what I wished for.

1781
01:00:58,290 --> 01:00:59,290
(Bluffing)

1782
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,200
So we're getting on this.

1783
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,730
It's so obvious.

1784
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,330
What is this?

1785
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,770
(Frowning)

1786
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,040
I saw this clip that was filmed
outside Korea.

1787
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,570
There was this chair
on top of a light aircraft.

1788
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:11,540
And they sat on the chair.

1789
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,310
- That sounds scary.
- Jae Seok got on it once.

1790
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:16,310
Are we going to see Jong Min
on this aircraft?

1791
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:18,310
For real?

1792
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:20,380
- Maybe we're going to see Jong Min.
- Jong Min...

1793
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:22,050
I can't ride this.

1794
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:24,150
Did you see the plane
on the way here, Se Yoon?

1795
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:25,950
We probably weigh about the same.

1796
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,320
Who will fly who?

1797
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,060
- Everyone.
- What are we doing here?

1798
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,860
- You will be doing...
- What is it?

1799
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:33,900
- Aren't we going to have fun?
- something else.

1800
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,100
- While riding a plane?
- What is it?

1801
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,200
You want us to pull that?

1802
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,200
No way.

1803
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,400
With our mouth.

1804
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,900
I'd rather do that.

1805
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:42,770
- I'm good at that.
- Please open it.

1806
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,210
- What? Why?
- Please.

1807
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,210
- Don't open it.
- What is it?

1808
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,880
(They're nervous.)

1809
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,580
What is it?

1810
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,750
What is this?

1811
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,780
(What did they see?)

1812
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:54,850
What is this?

1813
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,790
(What could it be?)

1814
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:59,520
Look. It's like a hang-glider.

1815
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,790
(A hang-glider?)

1816
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,460
- What is this?
- This is scary.

1817
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,830
- What's this?
- This...

1818
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,460
- This is scary.
- What is this?

1819
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,030
- What's this?
- This...

1820
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:10,130
(Why is this in front of us?)

1821
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,300
- What?
- There's only one control seat.

1822
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,870
Will we be flying it?

1823
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:14,970
It seats two people.

1824
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:17,710
(A non-powered hang-glider...)

1825
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,210
(with a small engine and propeller)

1826
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:25,050
(A lightweight aircraft
with its own propulsion)

1827
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,420
(A power hang-glider)

1828
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:32,020
(It's built for 2 people.)

1829
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,120
- What is this?
- What is this?

1830
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,160
(They all go inside
to take a closer look.)

1831
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,460
It's written there. A flight?

1832
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:42,160
(Cursing with his eyes)

1833
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:44,430
- What's this?
- Do you sit at the back?

1834
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,930
It's moving.

1835
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,040
I think we will sit at the back.

1836
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,270
What is this?

1837
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,840
Does this fly?

1838
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,970
What is this?

1839
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:53,770
It doesn't have a roof.

1840
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,810
- Does it fly with this propeller?
- It doesn't have a roof.

1841
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:00,010
(The most anxious 0.1T
at this moment)

1842
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,880
I get the feeling...

1843
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,520
that one person will be on it.

1844
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,850
What connection does this have
to "real?"

1845
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:09,260
What is that? What is it?

1846
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:12,260
This is a hang gliding
experience center...

1847
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,790
located on Bingdo Island, Boryeong.

1848
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,960
- Bingdo Island?
- My gosh.

1849
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,330
(Bingdo Island
hang gliding experience center)

1850
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:19,470
Flying at an altitude of 500m,

1851
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:20,670
you can enjoy a thrilling experience
with a view from Anmyeondo Island...

1852
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:23,640
all the way to Maensapji,

1853
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,770
where dinosaur footprints
were discovered.

1854
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,080
For reference, 500m high
is about the same height...

1855
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,780
as the Lotte Tower,

1856
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:33,050
the tallest building in Korea.

1857
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,620
(About this high)

1858
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:40,120
That's very high.

1859
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,960
- My gosh.
- That's really high.

1860
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,930
- Your intentions are bad.
- Why?

1861
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,630
Since Jong Min isn't around...

1862
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:47,460
This couldn't have happened
if Jong Min was here.

1863
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,760
He'd be like this if he was here.

1864
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,930
He'd go crazy.

1865
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,570
But there might be someone
who wants to ride it.

1866
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,100
- But I...
- You'll ride it alone.

1867
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,370
I'm not that scared of such things.

1868
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,870
I'm afraid of bungee jumping.

1869
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,410
- Me too.
- There's a professional on that.

1870
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:02,010
I blindly trust professionals.

1871
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,180
- Me too.
- Yes.

1872
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,080
But I trust them only if they have
more than 15 years of experience.

1873
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,280
It's 45 years for me.

1874
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:11,090
Unfortunately, there is...

1875
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:12,550
- For only one person?
- only one hang-glider.

1876
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,120
- So...
- One person?

1877
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,560
only one of you will get on it.

1878
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,230
But this is a team match.

1879
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:19,230
(Please)

1880
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,460
Do we get benefits if we ride that?

1881
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:24,130
You will be showing the viewers
something good to watch.

1882
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:27,100
Couldn't they watch it
on the Discovery channel?

1883
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:29,340
Theirs would be much better
than ours.

1884
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,810
- That's right.
- You can find it on YouTube.

1885
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:33,240
We'd only be screaming.

1886
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,410
- That's all we would do.
- That's right.

1887
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,710
- Would it be possible for Se Yoon?
- I'd break something.

1888
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:41,350
There might be a legal restriction
for him.

1889
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,850
- Up to 120kg.
- We asked the staff.

1890
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,990
We just need to pay
some more for the fuel.

1891
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:48,390
- What?
- He can get on it.

1892
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:50,660
- I have to pay for the fuel?
- No, we...

1893
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,660
I have to pay for the fuel?

1894
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,900
- Is there no weight limit?
- Really?

1895
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,700
He's a sports car.

1896
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,870
(He doesn't have
great fuel efficiency.)

1897
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,700
Se Yoon is very scared
of these things.

1898
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,700
- That's right.
- When he gets off,

1899
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:04,410
his jeans may have turned
into dark blue.

1900
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:05,810
The pants would have a pattern.

1901
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:07,480
I already feel like
I'll wet my pants.

1902
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:09,880
- It looks a bit fun too.
- Yes.

1903
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:10,910
- Everyone.
- It would be fun.

1904
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:12,050
- What am I going to do?
- I'm not scared of that.

1905
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,180
Please start the preparations.

1906
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:14,220
No way.

1907
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,450
- We have to get on it.
- What is this?

1908
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:17,990
(Something comes in.)

1909
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:19,390
Is it ddakji?

1910
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:22,620
Everyone,

1911
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:24,760
This is how we'll decide
the person to ride the hang-glider.

1912
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:26,260
You will fly the paper planes.

1913
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,500
- The person whose plane...
- But there's so much wind.

1914
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,500
flies the furthest
will get on the hang-glider.

1915
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:33,970
- Can we use any of these?
- You will make it yourself.

1916
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,670
- This...
- The sketchbook paper...

1917
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:36,700
would be the best.

1918
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,140
No. Since there's wind,

1919
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,610
you have to choose the light one.

1920
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,740
- Wouldn't this be better?
- Come on.

1921
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:43,780
(They're all busy choosing papers.)

1922
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:45,650
(Sighing)

1923
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,320
(He's still mind-controlling.)

1924
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,890
- I...
- Gosh.

1925
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:52,520
What's going on?

1926
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:53,920
Is this okay?

1927
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,520
Hey.

1928
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,660
It's quite windy today.

1929
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:58,960
(It happens to be windy today.)

1930
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:01,030
- Are you sure it can fly today?
- Press them with this.

1931
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:04,100
Wouldn't it be a challenge
for the pilot as well?

1932
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:06,570
- Right.
- Has he tried this in this weather?

1933
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:09,040
Director Hyun Woo went on a ride
20 minutes ago.

1934
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,100
- Hyun Woo went?
- But we didn't see that.

1935
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,140
It wasn't recorded.

1936
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,240
(Don't worry. It's safe.)

1937
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:18,650
(The most serious
paper plane folding scene)

1938
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,150
(Doing his best)

1939
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:24,250
(They're more desperate
than ever before.)

1940
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,120
(And...)

1941
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,190
Hey.

1942
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,490
(Look at him.)

1943
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:31,560
Se Yoon is doing his best.

1944
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:34,930
The most serious paper plane making
in Se Yoon's life.

1945
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,600
This too.

1946
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:40,200
(Please)

1947
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,370
I used to fly lots of paper planes
when I was young.

1948
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:46,670
(Paper type: A4 paper)

1949
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:50,110
In order to minimize air resistance,

1950
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,480
it will fly straight.

1951
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,550
(Paper type: Colored paper)

1952
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,180
It just doesn't have to be me.

1953
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:00,860
(Paper type: Sketchbook paper)

1954
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,120
It will make use
of the air resistance.

1955
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,030
(Paper type: A4 paper)

1956
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,660
Mine is open at the back.

1957
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,300
It will absorb the air resistance.

1958
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:12,200
It will ride the wind.

1959
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:15,470
(Paper type: The cover page
of the sketchbook)

1960
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:20,940
(The 1st Paper Airplane
Throwing Contest starts.)

1961
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,010
- There's no wind now.
- Fly it,

1962
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:24,310
and when it lands,

1963
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:26,610
we'll count to three,
and that will be the record.

1964
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:28,120
- That too.
- Yes?

1965
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:31,350
You have to throw it
within ten seconds when you stand here.

1966
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:33,490
- Okay.
- You can't wait...

1967
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:35,060
- until there's wind.
- That's a good idea.

1968
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,120
Okay.

1969
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,630
(Player 1 DinDin comes forward.)

1970
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:41,200
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Please.

1971
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:44,000
Please. Drop!

1972
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,270
Drop!

1973
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,100
(He calmly checks the wind.)

1974
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,840
Five, four, three...

1975
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,280
He won't be able to throw it.
There's no wind.

1976
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:57,510
(He flies the plane
leaving just 1 second.)

1977
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,850
(How far will it go?)

1978
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,520
Three...

1979
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,090
(The plane landed
as soon as it took off.)

1980
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:06,390
Two, one!

1981
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:07,790
Okay!

1982
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:11,730
Three, two, one!

1983
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,060
(It's not moving at all.)

1984
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,400
- Okay!
- No.

1985
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,530
- This is far enough.
- Okay.

1986
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:18,170
Okay!

1987
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:20,600
(Mine would go further than that.)

1988
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,970
- Please.
- Gosh.

1989
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,770
DinDin would be going.

1990
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:24,910
(They expect DinDin to be
in last place.)

1991
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:27,010
We'll check the very front part.

1992
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:29,180
- It won't go so far.
- It's going to be DinDin.

1993
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,640
(Player 2 Cho Sae Ho)

1994
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,810
- Let's go!
- You have ten seconds.

1995
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:35,350
(The 10-second countdown begins.)

1996
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,020
Seven, six,

1997
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:39,290
- Good.
- five...

1998
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,120
- What?
- What?

1999
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,720
- What?
- What?

2000
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:44,660
Five...

2001
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:48,100
- What?
- Three, two, one!

2002
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,670
(It looked like
it fell down right away,)

2003
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:54,440
(but it went farther than DinDin's.)

2004
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,200
- Stop!
- Hey!

2005
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,270
There's that...

2006
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:59,340
It flies farther.

2007
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,310
- It flies from the ground.
- Yes.

2008
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:04,550
(He can't control his joy.)

2009
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:08,380
(Sae Ho's record
is a bit farther than DinDin's.)

2010
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:10,420
(The 1st Paper Airplane
Throwing Contest)

2011
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,620
(1st Sae Ho, A4 paper)

2012
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,360
You have to make it light for this.

2013
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,960
Se Yoon is nervous.

2014
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,930
(The highest level of anxiety
in his 44 years of life)

2015
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:21,730
- The wind is the key.
- Ten,

2016
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:22,900
- Is that far?
- nine...

2017
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,500
(Will the wind help Se Yoon too?)

2018
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:28,540
Ten, nine, eight,

2019
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,640
- seven,
- Let's go!

2020
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,770
six, five...

2021
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,380
(No...)

2022
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:37,810
- Seven...
- Let's go!

2023
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,350
(The plane crashes
as soon as it takes off.)

2024
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,480

(Laughing)

2026
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,990
(His only hope is
for it to be moved by the wind.)

2027
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,960
(Please blow, wind.)

2028
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,930
(Flinching)

2029
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,260
(Will a miracle happen for me?)

2030
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:00,230

2031
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,270
Stop!

2032
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,670
(Screaming)

2033
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:04,510
Isn't that crazy?

2034
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,270
What is this?

2035
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:10,110
(Se Yoon is in last place.)

2036
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:14,320
(It's someone else's trouble.)

2037
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,580
- The front part.
- No.

2038
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:18,290
Don't touch it.

2039
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:19,790
(Why is this happening to me?)

2040
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:21,790
Let's start when there's wind.

2041
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:23,290
(The 1st Paper Airplane
Throwing Contest)

2042
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:25,660
(1st Sae Ho, 2nd DinDin,
3rd Se Yoon)

2043
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,360
- I'll go.
- There's wind now.

2044
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,800
(Player 4 Yoo Seon Ho)

2045
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:33,730
I used to fly lots of paper planes
when I was young.

2046
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:34,770
(Let's see how good Seon Ho is
at flying it!)

2047
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,940
You can just throw it gently.

2048
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,410
Awesome.

2049
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:41,680
Awesome.

2050
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:45,950
(A smooth flight)

2051
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,050
(Smiling)

2052
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,420
(Seon Ho)

2053
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,120
(A perfect trajectory)

2054
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,960
Three, two, one, stop!

2055
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,760
I used to fly many paper planes
when I was young.

2056
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,360
It hasn't been long
since he flew a paper plane.

2057
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,730
(He failed to escape last place.)

2058
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:08,670
(He's a strong candidate
for the hang-glider ride.)

2059
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,070
(The 1st Paper Airplane
Throwing Contest)

2060
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:13,010
(1st Seon Ho, 2nd Sae Ho,
3rd DinDin, 4th Se Yoon)

2061
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:15,840
(Last player Lee Joon)

2062
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:19,280
(The wind suddenly blows.)

2063
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:22,550
(The wind is quite strong.)

2064
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:27,020
(He will win
if he uses the wind well!)

2065
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:31,330
(Se Yoon's fate
is left in Joon's hands.)

2066
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,860
- I'll go!
- Go now!

2067
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:33,930
I'll go!

2068
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:37,100
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2069
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:41,470
(Is it Se Yoon or Joon?)

2070
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:42,670
I'll go!

2071
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,810
(Soaring)

2072
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:51,150
(The plane flies far away
as soon as it gets released.)

2073
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:55,320
(Se Yoon has been decided
to be in last place.)

2074
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:57,790
(Joon)

2075
01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:00,650
(It's like the wind is
pulling the plane.)

2076
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,790
(It even moves away
from the cameras.)

2077
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:07,390
(Festival scenes)

2078
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,430
- I did it.
- It went so far away.

2079
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:13,130
(Just except for one person)

2080
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,540
Look over there.

2081
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,270
Look at my plane.

2082
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:18,270
- That was hilarious.
- I'm in first place by far.

2083
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,440
- Gosh, that was hilarious.
- Look at my plane.

2084
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,570
That was amazing.

2085
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,940
Why aren't you aware
of this basic principle?

2086
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,250
(Se Yoon wasn't aware
of this basic principle...)

2087
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:29,080
(and gets decided
to be on the hang glider.)

2088
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,750
Remember the color of his pants.

2089
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:33,490
(Here's the evidence.)

2090
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:36,820
This is the one that will help out
with Se Yoon's experience.

2091
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:39,630
I will introduce you
to the hang-glider pilot.

2092
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,030
- Please come out.
- Hello.

2093
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

2094
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,900
- Please say we can't fly.
- It's great to see you.

2095
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,300
You don't have to force it.

2096
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,040
- It's a perfect day to fly.
- No.

2097
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:50,070
- Please introduce yourself.
- Right.

2098
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,470
I am Instructor Kim Dong Gyu,

2099
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:53,840
and I will be in charge
of today's flight.

2100
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,140
(Veteran pilot
with 19 years of experience)

2101
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,410
(Instructor Kim Dong Gyu)

2102
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,550
Please tell me a lot of things
that can lift me up.

2103
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:00,480
What are some things
you can tell me?

2104
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,120
What was the heaviest weight
you had on the hang-glider?

2105
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,580
The heaviest weight was 140kg.

2106
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:06,220
- You're fine then.
- Well, with my mic on,

2107
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,320
- it should be around that.
- Right.

2108
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,820
Is more fuel used
when there's more weight?

2109
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,760
Yes. It's true.

2110
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,760
It's true?
(Laughing)

2111
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,760
Please fill up the tank.

2112
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:20,100
Can you do this
while flying as well?

2113
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,470
(Bouncing)

2114
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,840
(You punk!)

2115
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,470
- Bouncing up and down.
- That's possible.

2116
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:25,740
Can you do this as well?

2117
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,370
Got it.

2118
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:28,610
(Being super silly)

2119
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,940
(Gritting his teeth)

2120
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,780
- Experiencing zero gravity!
- Yes.

2121
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:33,780
You let others experience
zero gravity?

2122
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:36,550
The director asked for that,
so I have that prepared.

2123
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:38,650
- Really?
- We will fall straight down.

2124
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:39,950
- Director Joo.
- Yes?

2125
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:41,260
Why ask for that
when you're scared to be on it?

2126
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,590
I heard that experience
was provided too.

2127
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:44,590
- Right.
- Really?

2128
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:47,560
I heard people feel born again
through the zero gravity experience.

2129
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:49,800
I don't want to be born again.

2130
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,230
I'm satisfied with myself.

2131
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,470
All right. Let's go.

2132
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:56,300
- Fine.
- Okay. Let's go.

2133
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,040
- Let's go.
- I'm jealous.

2134
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,370
- I'm jealous.
- It looks like fun.

2135
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:01,880
It does look fun.

2136
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,010
(Letting out a big sigh)

2137
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,480
How did this happen to me?

2138
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,750
I think it will be okay
once you get used to it.

2139
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,690
- Right.
- You should film it.

2140
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:13,690
It will fall out of my pocket.

2141
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:15,820
- I'm so jealous!
- Just hold it with your hand.

2142
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,490
I'm jealous. I want to be on it too.

2143
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:18,590
(The ones next to him
keep teasing him as well.)

2144
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:20,290
I'm jealous too.

2145
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,200
I feel like giving it a try
after avoiding to be on it.

2146
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:23,700
Place your left foot here.

2147
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:24,770
- Here?
- Right.

2148
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:26,800
Hold it with your hand.
There you go.

2149
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,040
- Do I keep my feet like this?
- Yes.

2150
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,040
(It's tight.)

2151
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:31,870
I'm sweating.

2152
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:33,270
It will feel cool up there.

2153
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:36,380
Don't look down
and just look at the sky.

2154
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:38,150
Is it supposed to go up this much?

2155
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:39,980
- Is this right?
- Hold on.

2156
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:42,550
- It must be really scary.
- Yes, it must be scary up there.

2157
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:43,650
Can we talk to each other
through this?

2158
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:44,650
Yes.

2159
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,290
- He's scared.
- Right.

2160
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,420
The helmet doesn't fit him!

2161
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:50,320
I don't think I can do this
because of the helmet!

2162
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,360
(Boldly fitting in the helmet)

2163
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:53,060
Push it forward.

2164
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,260
(Swaying)

2165
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,560
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

2166
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,570
He's ready now.

2167
01:14:58,570 --> 01:14:59,870
That's the best he can do.

2168
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,270
- Here?
- Gosh.

2169
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:02,300
What next?

2170
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,700
- This is driving me crazy.
- Shall we go now?

2171
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,140
It's so windy right now.

2172
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:06,340
That is why it will be exciting.

2173
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,610
Gosh, I can't believe this.
How did this happen to me?

2174
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,480
Please fly safely.

2175
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,710
- Bye!
- Se Yoon has two children!

2176
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,980
(Turning on the engine)

2177
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,990
You don't have to do the things
the director asked you to do.

2178
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:20,850
They're heading out.

2179
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:23,690
Se Yoon!

2180
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:25,160
(The plane heads out to the runway.)

2181
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:26,930
Joo Jong Hyun!

2182
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:29,660
- Go!
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2183
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:34,640
- We'll lift off soon.
- Okay.

2184
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:36,340
- It looks amazing.
- Right.

2185
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:38,210
There's a runway out there.

2186
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:40,170
(Say hello to the camera.)

2187
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,880
(Scowling)

2188
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:44,480
Are they taking off right away?

2189
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,450
(Take-off in 10 seconds)

2190
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:52,020
It will be very shaky
during take-off.

2191
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:54,420
Please be prepared for that.

2192
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:57,560
Okay. I'll tell you
if I can't handle it.

2193
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,430
(The endless runway
unfolds in front of Se Yoon.)

2194
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,160
- It will be quick.
- Right.

2195
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,230
(Take-off in 3 seconds)

2196
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:04,300
(Take-off in 2 seconds)

2197
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,800
(Take-off in 1 second)

2198
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,870
We will take off.

2199
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,640
(Take-off)

2200
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:14,570
(Giving up)

2201
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,040
(Laughing)

2202
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:25,250
(Se Yoon flies.)

2203
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,360
(The plane lifts up
into the air in a flash.)

2204
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,590
(Screaming)

2205
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:43,440
(A sight that is hard to believe
even while watching)

2206
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,470
That's amazing.

2207
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:45,870
Why does it look so shaky?

2208
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:48,910
- Gosh!
- Look at that!

2209
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,750
- Is that okay?
- Is that okay?

2210
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,080
(Shaking)

2211
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:56,650
(The plane naturally shakes
through the wind.)

2212
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,350
(Screaming)

2213
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,360
(It soars up to a higher altitude.)

2214
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:09,460
- Gosh.
- It looks like a paper plane.

2215
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,530
I'm glad I avoided that.
That looks really scary.

2216
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:12,730
- It's shaking so much.
- It's shaking so much.

2217
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:13,870
It's shaking so much.

2218
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:19,070
(They disappear into the distance
in a flash.)

2219
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:24,580
(Who am I? Where am I?)

2220
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,250
Gosh, Joo Jong Hyun!

2221
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:31,280
(Shaking)

2222
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,790
(Open your eyes, Fatty Gun.)

2223
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:37,420
(There's a reason
why he has his eyes closed.)

2224
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:40,660
(A thrilling view is spread out
beneath him.)

2225
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:46,230
That's amazing.

2226
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:48,100
- It must be really scary.
- It goes so high up.

2227
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,040
He said it'd go up to 500m.

2228
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:54,470
The altitude is around 500m.

2229
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:58,010
(The plane has reached
the highest altitude in a flash.)

2230
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:01,750
(They have now reached
a stable altitude.)

2231
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:03,820
It feels better now, right?

2232
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,690
(It doesn't feel better.)

2233
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,060
The island that you see
over there is Anmyeondo Island.

2234
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:13,960
It's right there.

2235
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:18,100
(Taean's Anmyeondo Island
is seen from a distance.)

2236
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:23,340
(A full view of the dinosaur track site
is seen.)

2237
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:27,470
(After passing the land
and mountains of Boryeong,)

2238
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:30,710
(the most beautiful...)

2239
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:34,110
(blue Yellow Sea
unfolds before their eyes.)

2240
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:40,190
(A precious moment
of viewing these sights)

2241
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:41,660
Try spreading out your arms.

2242
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,690
There you go. That's great.

2243
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,860
(Filming "Titanic" 500m in the air)

2244
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,260
Okay!

2245
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:51,900
(I did it!)

2246
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,270
(The mesmerizing view
above the clouds...)

2247
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:02,640
(makes your fear go away.)

2248
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:08,950
(He now strikes a V comfortably
in front of the camera.)

2249
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:10,580
You feel a bit better now, right?

2250
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,890
Yes. Just a little bit.

2251
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:15,360
All right. It's time for
the zero gravity experience!

2252
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,660
We're going down!

2253
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:21,060
(Diving down)

2254
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,400
(Screaming)

2255
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,930
Zero gravity. Here we go again.

2256
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,070
(Experiencing zero gravity
once again)

2257
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:37,110
(While Se Yoon is enjoying his time
up in the sky...)

2258
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,310
It does look like fun.

2259
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:39,350
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
experience.

2260
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:40,680
Right.

2261
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,080
What's this?

2262
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,520
- What?
- What is that?

2263
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,650
- What is that?
- What is that?

2264
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:47,350
It's a giant fan.

2265
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:48,390
(A giant fan?)

2266
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:49,420
What is that?

2267
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:50,860
- All right, everyone.
- What is this?

2268
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:53,560
The first mission to obtain
bivouac supplies...

2269
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,300
- will begin now.
- What?

2270
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,930
We have to work as a group
without Se Yoon?

2271
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:59,030
Yes. Before Se Yoon returns...

2272
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:01,300
from the hang-glider,

2273
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,540
you must succeed in the mission.

2274
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:05,340
It is called Four Guys of the Wind.

2275
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:06,540
Four Guys of the Wind?

2276
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,940
You will take turns
and put on the clothes...

2277
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,580
prepared in front of the giant fan.

2278
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:13,050
You will get one item
every time you succeed.

2279
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:14,480
- That sounds easy.
- If we make it back?

2280
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,120
- Yes.
- Can we start without clothes on?

2281
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:19,220
It won't look good though.

2282
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,820
I'm wearing brand-name underpants.

2283
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,360
- We should avoid what we can avoid.
- What are you doing?

2284
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:25,660
Okay.

2285
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:27,530
- What is this?
- A parachute.

2286
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,460
We are wearing a parachute.

2287
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,970
How would we do that wearing this?

2288
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:34,870
What's this?

2289
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:36,370
(The wind is already strong
without the giant fan on.)

2290
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:38,210
This is just like the parasol race.

2291
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:40,570
- Hang on. What is this?
- This is hard.

2292
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:41,810
(Paper Doll is staggering already.)

2293
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,680
It's better to go barefoot.

2294
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,250
It's not slippery this way.

2295
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:48,220
Joon, it's hard to even stand still.

2296
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:51,480
(They must finish it
before Se Yoon makes a landing.)

2297
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,550
- Shall we go back now?
- Yes, we are going back now.

2298
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:58,260
(5 minutes left before landing)

2299
01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,890
Gosh, what's wrong with this?

2300
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:00,990
(They all must go against the wind
before the landing.)

2301
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,730
(Sae Ho is the 1st player.)

2302
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,230
(The giant fan is on.)

2303
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:07,600
Let's begin. Ready.

2304
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:09,870
(Shaking even before the start)

2305
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:10,970
Start.

2306
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,440
(Time left until landing)

2307
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,380
(Staggering)

2308
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:20,910
(He quickly approaches the clothes.)

2309
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:22,920
You have to hold onto the clothes.

2310
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,020
(Picking up)

2311
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,390
(He successfully puts on the pants.)

2312
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:31,120
The clothes might blow away
in the wind.

2313
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,130
(The 2nd hurdle is the shirt.)

2314
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:34,630
The clothes might blow away
in the wind.

2315
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:40,370
(He has a shirt on his face.)

2316
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,940
(Laughing)

2317
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,670
(Refreshed)

2318
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:49,780
(He manages to put on the shirt.)

2319
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:53,580
(He has to button up the shirt.)

2320
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:57,050
(It's not easy to do the buttons
because of the wind.)

2321
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,320
He's here.

2322
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,560
What was that?

2323
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:08,360
(What just flew by?)

2324
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:14,000
(Not now, Se Yoon.)

2325
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:17,870
(The plane has already come
near the runway.)

2326
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:21,040
(His crying starts again.)

2327
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:27,480
(They are watching each other
in real time.)

2328
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:31,020
(What? What are they doing?)

2329
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,720
(He can't afford
to care about others.)

2330
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:38,530
(4 minutes left before landing)

2331
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:41,490
(But the 1st player
is still struggling.)

2332
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:43,730
(It's finally the last button.)

2333
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:48,740
(Why is he sticking out his tongue?)

2334
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:50,470
(The last button is done.)

2335
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:51,910
- Okay.
- Okay.

2336
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:54,440
(The first player,
Sae Ho succeeded!)

2337
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:58,240
(The 2nd player, Lee Joon sets off.)

2338
01:22:58,450 --> 01:23:01,180
(In a hurry)

2339
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:02,620
It's not bad, but it's hard
to button up the shirt.

2340
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:03,720
Is it hard?

2341
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,120
(Lee Joon tries to put them on
while sitting down.)

2342
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,320
- It's not so bad.
- After doing that...

2343
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,950
- It's doable.
- Step on the clothes...

2344
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:09,460
so they won't blow away in the wind.

2345
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,230
(His balloon muscles
are blowing away.)

2346
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:16,460
(They fly away easily
as they are balloons.)

2347
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:18,570
(Blown away)

2348
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:21,000
- Look.
- That's what happens.

2349
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:24,370
(Fortunately, he picks it up
right away and put it on.)

2350
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:26,370
(Time left until landing)

2351
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:29,110
(He manages to put on the pants.)

2352
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,650
Darn it.

2353
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:36,750
(The next player
looks unsettling already.)

2354
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:38,920
Help me.

2355
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:42,390
(He focuses
without caring about others.)

2356
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:43,560
Help me.

2357
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:46,160
Success!

2358
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:49,700
(The second player,
Lee Joon passed!)

2359
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:52,300
(They have enough time left.)

2360
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:55,800
(But the next player is...)

2361
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,100
- You should do all the buttons.
- All of them? I see.

2362
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,770
(Paper Doll)

2363
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:03,940
(A deep bow)

2364
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,250
(Feeling bad for him)

2365
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:07,780
Put them on.

2366
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:11,550
(He quickly put on the pants
with all his might.)

2367
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,520
(Floundering)

2368
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,430
(The difficult part for Paper Doll
is to put on the shirt.)

2369
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:19,790
(Time left until landing)

2370
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:21,590
(He can't find the armhole.)

2371
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:22,600
Where is it?

2372
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,200
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

2373
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,430
What are you doing? Hurry!

2374
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:30,870
(Paper Doll is
helplessly wasting time.)

2375
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:35,010
(He hasn't put his one arm
into the sleeve yet.)

2376
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,110
What is he doing?

2377
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,380
You shouldn't put it on like that.
From the start... Good.

2378
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:41,710
(An air dancer wearing a parachute)

2379
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,320
What are you doing?

2380
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,190
(He finally put his arm
into the sleeve.)

2381
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:49,220
(But he has already wasted
too much time.)

2382
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,820
(Time left until landing)

2383
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,990
(Meanwhile, the plane
is preparing to land.)

2384
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:57,960
(Approaching the runway)

2385
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:01,800
(Se Yoon has no idea
what is going on down there.)

2386
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:04,700
(There's no time to waste.)

2387
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,910
(Anxious)

2388
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,680
(He pulls himself together
and buttons up the shirt.)

2389
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,910
It's done. Good.

2390
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:13,380
The last button.

2391
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:17,220
(The third player, Seon Ho passed!)

2392
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,320
Okay.

2393
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,050
(The last player is DinDin.)

2394
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,820
(He sits down
showing off his teeth.)

2395
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:26,490
(If Se Yoon lands now,
they fail to get the first item.)

2396
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:27,730
Did I take a long time?

2397
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,330
(Unlike Seon Ho,
he put on the shirt quickly.)

2398
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,800
(Please)

2399
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:37,200
(He sits down steadily
and puts it on.)

2400
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,210
(Time left until landing)

2401
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:41,540
(He succeeded
in putting on the shirt.)

2402
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:43,340
Just put on the pants now.

2403
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:48,380
(About to land)

2404
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:51,580
(Will he succeed
before the landing?)

2405
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,250
(The last hurdle is the pants.)

2406
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:57,660
(37 seconds left until landing)

2407
01:25:57,660 --> 01:26:00,630
(Time left until landing)

2408
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:03,460
- Okay. Success!
- He did it.

2409
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:05,270
(They succeeded in the mission.)

2410
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:07,170
- Nice.
- I did well, right?

2411
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:09,800
- What did you do?
- The shirt was too small.

2412
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:14,540
(Se Yoon landed safely too.)

2413
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:16,910
My goodness. Thank you.

2414
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:18,240
It was the best.

2415
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,480
(The variety spirit
both in the sky and on the ground)

2416
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:24,050
- You should've taken off the shirt.
- You should've taken it off.

2417
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:25,820
Why did you do that
with the shirt on?

2418
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:27,490
- My gosh.
- He's here.

2419
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:28,620
There he is.

2420
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:29,920
It was so close.

2421
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,720
It really stung.

2422
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:33,460
It was really funny earlier.

2423
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,860
He was flying behind us
while we were busy doing this.

2424
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:38,730
- It was really nice.
- Thank you.

2425
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:39,970
- Seriously.
- My pleasure.

2426
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:41,940
We succeeded anyway.

2427
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,240
It was fun, friends.

2428
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:45,570
(He's ready to proudly tell them
about the flight.)

2429
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,410
- How was it?
- What's with you?

2430
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:48,940
The color of your pants...

2431
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:51,280
We succeeded in the mission.

2432
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,280
- We did.
- What did you do?

2433
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:53,910
We got changed
in front of the giant fan.

2434
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:55,380
- You got changed?
- Yes. Look.

2435
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,480
How was it?

2436
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,820
- My goodness.
- You were waddling a lot.

2437
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:01,720
He did it with his hands.
When he pulls it...

2438
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:02,790
(He starts bragging.)

2439
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:04,660
(Go ahead and say
that I did an amazing job.)

2440
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:05,860
You can do anything you want.

2441
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:07,160
(It sounds like
he had a lot of fun.)

2442
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,190
And I was like...

2443
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:10,100
(Excessive dopamine)

2444
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,830
Then he told me, "Now you will
experience zero gravity."

2445
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,470
"Do I have to experience
zero gravity... Oh, dear."

2446
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:15,670
(He talked about it
for another 20 minutes after this.)

2447
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:17,440
Do they do that? I see.

2448
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,610
Anyway, we succeeded
in the mission, right?

2449
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:22,610
- While Se Yoon was flying,
- What about me?

2450
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:25,210
the four of them
succeeded in the mission.

2451
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:26,350
(They succeeded
in getting 1 bivouac supply.)

2452
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:27,380
- What is it?
- Give us the benefit.

2453
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:28,920
Apparently, we won one item.

2454
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,950
We will show you
the bivouac supplies we have.

2455
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:33,350
- Can we pick what we want?
- Here.

2456
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:35,590
Air mattress?

2457
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:37,460
Wouldn't it be nice
to have a wooden bench?

2458
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,660
(Wooden bench)

2459
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:41,390
(Sleeping bag)

2460
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:43,230
(Pillow and blanket)

2461
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,660
(The list of bivouac supplies)

2462
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,000
(Mat, tarpaulin and camping mat,
camp bed, newspaper,)

2463
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,230
(mosquito repellent device, parasol)

2464
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:48,530
We need pillows and blankets.

2465
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:49,570
We don't know
where we will be sleeping.

2466
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,900
No. We should get
air mattresses or sleeping bags.

2467
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:54,210
The sleeping bag has a dice.

2468
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:55,710
For your information,

2469
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:58,480
you will get only one piece
of the item you want.

2470
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,150
Why does the sleeping bag
have a dice?

2471
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:02,050
- As the number on the dice?
- Yes.

2472
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,250
Hang on.

2473
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:04,650
If we pick an air mattress,

2474
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:06,190
- we get only one?
- Yes.

2475
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:08,190
- Not five?
- Right.

2476
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:09,990
(But we are five people.)

2477
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:11,360
Seriously, you are so mean.

2478
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,830
I'm sorry.

2479
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,160
(It just spilled out of his mouth.)

2480
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,500
I know we have to take a risk,

2481
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:17,000
but we should pick a sleeping bag.

2482
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,430
- Right. We need it.
- So...

2483
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:20,030
Wherever it is, we can sleep
as long as we have a sleeping bag.

2484
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:21,830
- It's the safest choice.
- But we need a mat...

2485
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:24,100
in order to use a sleeping bag.

2486
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,370
Let's just go with the sleeping bag.

2487
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:26,940
We should get one for each.

2488
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:28,110
Let's go with the main item first.

2489
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:29,140
- We might get six.
- Okay.

2490
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:30,210
- Let's go.
- Let's go with the main item.

2491
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:32,010
- We can pick five.
- Right.

2492
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:33,810
- It has "again" on it.
- Come on.

2493
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:35,550
They changed six into "again."

2494
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:36,950
It doesn't have number six.

2495
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:38,350
- That's...
- They changed number six...

2496
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:39,720
(Rebellious)

2497
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:41,620
(Our distorted hero)

2498
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:43,420
I think they changed number six.

2499
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:44,890
Who will roll the dice?

2500
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:46,090
You picked the sleeping bag.

2501
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:48,160
The one who does this
will be criticized for sure.

2502
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:50,160
You're the oldest one here. Show us.

2503
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:53,370
What if we get number four?

2504
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:54,770
The four of us will get it?

2505
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:56,640
This is a lot of pressure.

2506
01:28:57,870 --> 01:29:00,010
(I enjoy a sense of pressure.)

2507
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:03,310
(I'm the son of the sky.)

2508
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,180
If you get five, it will be amazing.

2509
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:06,310
If he does, it'll be great.
And if he doesn't, he will...

2510
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:07,380
By the way...

2511
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:08,480
Jong Min.

2512
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,650
In a situation like this,

2513
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:12,020
Shouting to the sky?

2514
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:13,390
what would you do?

2515
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:14,950
What are you doing?
Is Jong Min dead?

2516
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:16,660
- Why...
- France is this way.

2517
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:19,190
France is over there.
I saw it while flying in the sky.

2518
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:21,190
Step back.

2519
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:23,130
- All right.
- We shouldn't touch it.

2520
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:25,200
I think I'm lucky today.

2521
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,630
If I get five...

2522
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:28,130
- You will...
- We will shout with joy.

2523
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:31,370
It's five, Jong Min. Five!

2524
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:35,240
(They will get as many sleeping bags
as the number on the dice.)

2525
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:38,910
(He throws it!)

2526
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:42,580
(If they get 5, all the members
will get sleeping bags.)

2527
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,020
(Next episode)

2528
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,530
(After the thrilling air battle
that made Se Yoon cry,)

2529
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:56,160
(it is the water battle now!)

2530
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:59,230
(Those who want bivouac supplies,)

2531
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:02,540
(fight the water.)

2532
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,610
(Sometimes, you must be sensitive.)

2533
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:09,180
(Sometimes, you must be bold.)

2534
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:12,950
(A cool trip
to win bivouac supplies)

2535
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,020
(What's most important
is to get my colleague wet.)

2536
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,790
(The physical tussle
to avoid the dive gets extreme.)

2537
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:22,290
(They forget the supplies...)

2538
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:24,260
(and focus on drenching others.)

2539
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:27,730
(Can they win the bivouac supplies?)

2540
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:29,300
(Come and meet 2 Days and 1 Night...)

2541
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,500
(by the sea.)
