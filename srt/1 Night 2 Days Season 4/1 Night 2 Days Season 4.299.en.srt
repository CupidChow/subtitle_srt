1
00:00:00,414 --> 00:00:02,984
(The gentle sunshine...)

2
00:00:03,854 --> 00:00:06,884
(and fragrant breeze is everywhere.)

3
00:00:08,624 --> 00:00:13,394
(Fall is when everything ripens.)

4
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:16,163
(We're in autumn Danyang...)

5
00:00:16,164 --> 00:00:19,334
(to start another trip.)

6
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:22,403
- It's cold.
- We're used to saying...

7
00:00:22,404 --> 00:00:24,004
how hot it is when we shoot the opening.

8
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,104
- It's nice weather for a jog.
- This weather.

9
00:00:27,344 --> 00:00:28,403
It's perfect.

10
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:29,943
(DinDin and Seon Ho feel the seasonal change.)

11
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:31,014
Hello.

12
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:33,184
Korea, so nice.

13
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:35,414
- This is...
- Korea, so good.

14
00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:36,884
What are you wearing?

15
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:39,424
- Korea, nice.
- What's up with the outfit?

16
00:00:39,724 --> 00:00:42,024
I'm dressed as an American biker.

17
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:44,454
It's called biker-core.

18
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:46,694
It's pretty up here.

19
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:48,263
It's really pretty.

20
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:50,164
How is the path...

21
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,863
(They're in awe of the scenery.)

22
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:54,763
It's a grand spectacle.

23
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,533
- Look at the wet fog.
- It's so cool...

24
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:58,333
how the weather caused the wet fog.

25
00:00:58,334 --> 00:00:59,743
No photo can do this justice.

26
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:01,504
It makes me feel like a mountain-bound guru.

27
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:04,213
Compared to our half-naked fashion show...

28
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:06,014
(An ominous sight of leather pants and heels)

29
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:08,243
- Hello.
- What is that?

30
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:10,114
- You're wearing a hat.
- What's this?

31
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:13,483
(A somewhat familiar look)

32
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:15,483
- "No, that's too textbook."
- Hello.

33
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:16,923
Who's that behind you?

34
00:01:16,924 --> 00:01:18,824
- Hello.
- You're too much.

35
00:01:19,154 --> 00:01:21,223
- What?
- Don't do that.

36
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:22,623
- What look is this?
- Don't.

37
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,663
Stop it.

38
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:24,833
- Don't.
- Leave him alone.

39
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,993
- What look is that?
- Don't do that.

40
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:27,733
- It's his treasure.
- What look is that?

41
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:28,763
No one does this for you.

42
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:30,134
- There's a reason for it.
- Yes.

43
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:32,804
You'll lose your mind when he takes this off.

44
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:36,343
(Plan to lose your mind shortly.)

45
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:37,773
You look like you'd ride a bike.

46
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:39,683
- Everyone looks awkwardly...
- I like your style.

47
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:40,713
A motorcycle look.

48
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:42,213
- American style.
- Yes.

49
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:44,114
- He was in the US.
- What's up, LA?

50
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:45,613
West Side all the way.

51
00:01:45,614 --> 00:01:47,423
- In the US...
- LA.

52
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:49,153
- He was there for a day.
- Just one day.

53
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:51,024
Who travels to the US for one day?

54
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:53,493
(Gosh...)

55
00:01:53,494 --> 00:01:54,593
(Laughing)

56
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:55,664
How strange.

57
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:57,333
It's strange.

58
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,263
- You must be warm.
- I'm cold.

59
00:01:59,264 --> 00:02:00,504
I'm wearing a vest underneath.

60
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:02,634
What on earth is that?

61
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:05,304
- That's too much.
- It's way too much.

62
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:08,374
It's way too much.

63
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:10,543
Who's too much?

64
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:11,744
- Him or me?
- You.

65
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,714
I'm nothing compared to him.

66
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,713
This concept...

67
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:17,183
It's not a lie when I say...

68
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:18,914
I saw someone like this in LA.

69
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:20,453
I saw a guy like this.

70
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:22,024
Gosh, this is scary.

71
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:24,453
(A gunslinger appears.)

72
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:26,023
- A rifle?
- What is this?

73
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:27,424
Look at his face.

74
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:29,364
What are you, Sae Ho?

75
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:31,363
Why am I the only one like this?

76
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:32,963
- What are you?
- You're...

77
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:34,763
- To start off...
- What a mess.

78
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:36,674
Hello, everyone. Introduce myself.

79
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:39,234
My look is jungle-core look.

80
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:42,303
The variety circuit is a jungle.

81
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,414
- We fight to survive.
- Who wears that in a jungle?

82
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,113
- "I will survive."
- Jungle-core?

83
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:47,143
That's what this means.

84
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:48,144
I see.

85
00:02:49,384 --> 00:02:50,983
(Jungle-core look)

86
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:52,653
(Strong, bold looks...)

87
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:54,154
(inspired by the wilderness)

88
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,583
- I'm...
- "The Good, the Bad, the Weird?"

89
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:56,994
I'm wearing the western-core look.

90
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,193
It's a style that the fashion world is watching closely.

91
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:01,563
- Is it?
- It suits you.

92
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:03,333
- You look cool, Jong Min.
- Do I?

93
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:06,564
- I'm wearing matcha-core.
- The matcha-core look.

94
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:09,303
Green is a popular color right now.

95
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:11,433
- That's the matcha-core look.
- Is it?

96
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:12,573
You're biker-core.

97
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:14,943
- Yes, I'm wearing biker-core.
- You know a lot.

98
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,773
I was in New York recently.

99
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:18,713
- I want to give off that aura.
- Okay.

100
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:20,583
This is dad-core or papa-core.

101
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:22,043
- You know right away.
- Really?

102
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:23,184
I love fashion.

103
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:24,653
You can't guess my look.

104
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:25,683
I know this one.

105
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:26,953
- What is Joon wearing?
- What's that?

106
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:29,100
- Isn't it something weird?
- Is it called ballet-core?

107
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:31,023
- Why do you think so?
- Recently, the look...

108
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:32,323
based on what ballerinas wear...

109
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:33,493
- Hey.
- The stylish version.

110
00:03:33,494 --> 00:03:35,264
Joon is yet to show his actual look.

111
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:36,864
- I can't.
- Show them.

112
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:39,093
What is this?

113
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,964
- Hang on.
- What's this?

114
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:42,933
I thought this looked gross.

115
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:46,504
I lost. I lose to his look.

116
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:48,074
Look.

117
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:51,243
This is too... It's terrible.

118
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:52,773
- We...
- What is this?

119
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,243
Look at the back. It's shorter.

120
00:03:54,244 --> 00:03:55,983
- Even I think...
- Look at the back.

121
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:57,183
Even for me...

122
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:59,653
It's so short. It's like a crop top.

123
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:00,683
Gosh.

124
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:03,353
(Sae Ho suddenly takes off his coat?)

125
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:04,694
It's all the rage these days.

126
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:07,223
For the moon by the sea

127
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:08,464
Yes, dance with him.

128
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:12,364
(Summoning FLY TO THE SKY)

129
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:13,933
(He dances despite the embarrassment.)

130
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,833
- He looks nice.
- I'm curious.

131
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:19,103
Do ballet dancers wear stuff like that?

132
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:20,873
It's not a ballet dancer look.

133
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:23,213
To be honest, it's Jennie's look.

134
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:24,873
- Jennie's look?
- She wore exactly this.

135
00:04:24,874 --> 00:04:27,183
I don't know how my stylist got it.

136
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,783
Jennie wore something like this?

137
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:30,213
She wore this exactly.

138
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:31,214
Don't lie.

139
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:32,554
- No way.
- She wore this?

140
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:34,414
- It looks different on me.
- Jennie...

141
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,923
(Jennie's ballet-core look has a quite different vibe.)

142
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:39,963
Jennie wore a top underneath.

143
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:41,724
- She did.
- But he's just naked underneath.

144
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:43,693
- Why...
- What? What is this?

145
00:04:43,694 --> 00:04:45,463
- I didn't know.
- She's wearing a top...

146
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:47,063
- underneath.
- How come I'm not wearing anything?

147
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:49,404
- There's a difference.
- Joon isn't wearing anything.

148
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:52,974
Hold on. Jennie's outfit is from a brand.

149
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:55,173
But yours was torn manually with a knife or something.

150
00:04:55,174 --> 00:04:56,174
- Right.
- My gosh.

151
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:58,343
- Look at that.
- Hey, yours is handmade.

152
00:04:58,344 --> 00:05:00,344
- Right. It's handmade.
- Goodness, it's handmade.

153
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:05,153
(He's Joon, not Jennie.)

154
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:06,914
(100 percent handmade, the ballet-core look)

155
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:10,593
(The one who tamed a lion, the fashion emperor, )

156
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:11,824
(the jungle-core look)

157
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:13,794
(Blowing)

158
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:15,523
(I'll shoot if it goes wrong.)

159
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,210
(The irresistible gunman, the western-core look)

160
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,433
(The real-life dad, )

161
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:19,964
(the dad-core look, perfect execution)

162
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:22,264
(Smirking)

163
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:24,073
(A soft gaze, legs for days, the matcha-core look)

164
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,074
(A soft gaze, legs for days, the matcha-core look)

165
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:32,244
(Got a taste of the US, a kid from LA, the biker-core look)

166
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:36,613
- Why are we dressed like this?
- Core looks.

167
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:38,453
Your outfit has something to do...

168
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:40,984
- with the theme of today's trip.
- What?

169
00:05:41,254 --> 00:05:43,093
Have you heard of season-core?

170
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,094
- No.
- It's my first time hearing it.

171
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,094
- Same here.
- Season-core.

172
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,563
I've heard of yellowtails in season.

173
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:47,793
- What's season-core?
- Yellowtails in season.

174
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:51,493
It's a newly coined term of season and core.

175
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:53,633
It refers to a consumer culture...

176
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:54,903
of the zoomers...

177
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,474
who want to enjoy the moment to the fullest.

178
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,384
Something they can only do in the present.

179
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:02,503
That's how we came up with the theme of today's trip.

180
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:04,013
A new season has crept up on us.

181
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:06,444
To make the most out of this fleeting winter,

182
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:08,944
- we prepared a season-core journey.
- Fleeting winter?

183
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:10,113
- You mean autumn.
- Autumn.

184
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:11,653
To make the most out of this fleeting autumn...

185
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:13,124
Shoot him.

186
00:06:13,324 --> 00:06:15,183
- Shoot him if he makes a mistake.
- I'll start shooting.

187
00:06:15,184 --> 00:06:16,253
I'll shoot.

188
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:17,614
(If you get it wrong, I'll shoot.)

189
00:06:17,894 --> 00:06:18,894
(Do it right.)

190
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:21,163
- If he messes up, shoot him.
- Your posture...

191
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:22,663
Your posture...

192
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:24,433
To make the most out of this fleeting autumn,

193
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:25,833
we prepared a season-core journey.

194
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:27,203
It's called In This Autumn Moment.

195
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:30,074
(In This Autumn Moment)

196
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:31,433
- In This Autumn Moment.
- Yes.

197
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,104
So today...

198
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:35,704
(To enjoy autumn to the fullest, )

199
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:39,473
(they will visit cities with stunning nature...)

200
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:43,114
(and fun activities.)

201
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:45,414
we'll travel to Danyang...

202
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:47,624
and Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province.

203
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:49,554
- Danyang and Jecheon.
- Jecheon.

204
00:06:49,624 --> 00:06:51,753
From here, you can enjoy...

205
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:53,694
beautiful fall foliage at its peak.

206
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:56,223
- It's a famous spot in Danyang.
- Danyang is so beautiful.

207
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:57,933
It's called Bobaljae Observatory.

208
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,293
- Bobaljae Observatory.
- Yes.

209
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,563
- How beautiful.
- Bobaljae Observatory.

210
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:02,264
It's like looking at a painting here.

211
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:05,033
Doesn't it feel like we're watching a cartoon?

212
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:06,103
It's so beautiful.

213
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:08,504
- People ride motorcycles here.
- Right.

214
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,514
Jong Min, Sae Ho, and Joon will team up today.

215
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:12,773
- My gosh.
- Jong Min,

216
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:13,883
- Sae Ho, and Joon?
- Why?

217
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:15,343
- You already divided us into teams?
- And...

218
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:17,554
Se Yoon, DinDin, and Seon Ho will team up.

219
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,583
Through missions today,

220
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:21,283
you'll have to obtain slots on the spinning wheel.

221
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:22,623
- Okay.
- Then you will...

222
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:24,423
write down each other's names.

223
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:26,253
We'll spin the wheel at the end.

224
00:07:26,254 --> 00:07:27,363
The members chosen by the wheel...

225
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,463
- My gosh.
- will face the penalty.

226
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:30,693
The losing team...

227
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,894
that failed to enjoy autumn to the fullest...

228
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:36,634
will get off work after completing a special task tomorrow.

229
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:38,073
It will be decided now?

230
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:39,273
So that will be decided today?

231
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:40,874
- Yes.
- The team that will stay behind?

232
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:42,343
Here's the first mission of the day.

233
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:44,314
It's called Hardcore Version of Flipping Cards.

234
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,243
- Hardcore.
- I like hardcore games.

235
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:47,244
- I know.
- I like hardcore games.

236
00:07:47,245 --> 00:07:49,883
A member will stay on each floor...

237
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:51,114
of the observatory.

238
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:52,713
The members on the 1st and 2nd floors...

239
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:55,354
will memorize half of the cards on the board.

240
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:57,194
It's a memorization game?

241
00:07:57,254 --> 00:07:59,863
Then they will come up to the observatory...

242
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:02,864
and flip the cards to match the cards.

243
00:08:03,964 --> 00:08:05,694
(However, )

244
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:07,863
(when they flip the matching cards, )

245
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,973
(they can keep going.)

246
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:11,134
- Okay.
- But...

247
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:15,174
if they are wrong, the third member...

248
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:17,314
must complete 20 squats...

249
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:19,413
for them to get another chance to flip the cards.

250
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:20,914
(They can flip the cards again.)

251
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:22,684
You will be given seven minutes.

252
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:25,783
You only have one chance to go back...

253
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:26,924
and check the board.

254
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:28,423
- That's not easy.
- I see.

255
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,854
Can you do squats?

256
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:31,824
- Like sitting down and getting up?
- Try it.

257
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:33,493
- I can do it.
- Try it.

258
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:35,123
If I do it now, I can't do it later.

259
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:36,763
- We should do half squats.
- Half squats?

260
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:38,263
- Then this is a half squat.
- That's it.

261
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:40,133
- Make sure he does it properly.
- Try it.

262
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:41,264
Try it.

263
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:43,373
You go to the 1st floor. I'll go to the 2nd floor. He'll do squats.

264
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:45,273
- It's settled.
- Fine. Okay.

265
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,373
(He quickly gives up on doing squats.)

266
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:48,603
- Why don't they go first?
- I bet they'll struggle too.

267
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:50,013
No. They should go first.

268
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:52,213
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Lower your gun, man.

269
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:53,313
His gun...

270
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:55,313
Don't try to threaten me with the gun.

271
00:08:55,314 --> 00:08:57,413
- You'd better go first.
- You're pointing your gun at me?

272
00:08:57,414 --> 00:08:58,414
- You go first.
- Let's keep it fair.

273
00:08:58,415 --> 00:08:59,783
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Yes.

274
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:01,383
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

275
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:02,884
- Okay.
- Okay. They'll go first.

276
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:05,653
The team that's going first will go down.

277
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:07,064
- Go down.
- Hey, dummy.

278
00:09:07,264 --> 00:09:08,763
If both of us do well, that will be great.

279
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:10,693
But one person can carry this game.

280
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:13,033
But look. No. It's impossible for one person to carry the game.

281
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:14,633
- Why not?
- I can't see the other half.

282
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:15,663
That's my point.

283
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:17,233
Someone has to flip the card first.

284
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:19,634
Let's say I couldn't memorize anything. And you're a genius.

285
00:09:19,774 --> 00:09:22,173
When I flip a card, you can match my card by flipping the same one.

286
00:09:22,174 --> 00:09:24,444
In the end, one person can win the game for us.

287
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:26,273
- If he memorizes everything?
- Of course.

288
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,043
- I get it.
- We can win if you do well.

289
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:29,913
- I'll try my best to memorize them.
- Yes.

290
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:31,353
- You're smart.
- But you must memorize some.

291
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:33,584
You studied abroad. But I studied in Korea.

292
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:35,424
I went abroad to learn English.

293
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:37,424
He went abroad to learn English?

294
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,274
Can you show me the board a little earlier?

295
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:40,864
Really?

296
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:42,923
(Meanwhile, on the 3rd floor...)

297
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:44,434
(Ringing)

298
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:46,433
(Seon Ho is practicing his squats.)

299
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:47,803
You have to ring the bell when you do squats?

300
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:51,133
Yes. It might go into my butthole because it's so sharp.

301
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:53,033
- Right.
- I'll press it with my thigh.

302
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:54,973
My gosh. You're right.

303
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:56,773
This is the problem. We'll probably rush.

304
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:58,290
We'll have to finish 20 squats quickly.

305
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:00,214
I'm afraid that might happen when I rush.

306
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:03,044
- The first team will start now.
- Great.

307
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:05,354
The members downstairs will start the game now!

308
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:06,684
Get ready!

309
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:09,084
(DinDin on the 1st floor)

310
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:11,854
(Se Yoon on the 2nd floor)

311
00:10:12,324 --> 00:10:13,324
Set...

312
00:10:14,524 --> 00:10:17,064
(Go!)

313
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,404
(The board is open for 30 seconds.)

314
00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:24,734
(The left side)

315
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:29,404
(The right side)

316
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:32,673
(Why don't you try memorizing the cards too?)

317
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,883
(Apple, forsythia, cactus, onion, broccoli, rose, banana, plane, )

318
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,083
(helicopter, melon, orange, ship, car, grape, forsythia, )

319
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:39,724
(fall foliage, napa cabbage, plane, rose, avocado, kiwi, peach...)

320
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:41,153
- That's...
- It's harder than I thought.

321
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:42,524
Hey, this is so hard.

322
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:44,253
(Apple, forsythia, cactus, onion, helicopter, melon, orange, ship, )

323
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:45,893
(napa cabbage, plane, rose, avocado, cherry blossom, banana, )

324
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:47,623
(fall foliage, grape, car, broccoli, sunflower, kiwi...)

325
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:48,963
(Broccoli, rose, banana, plane, car, grape, forsythia, fall foliage, )

326
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:50,393
(kiwi, peach, bicycle, carrot, melon, apple, sunflower, )

327
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:51,663
(napa cabbage, onion, ship, hot air balloon, orange, avocado...)

328
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:53,703
- You have ten seconds left.
- Oh, dear.

329
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:56,004
(helicopter, cherry blossom, cactus)

330
00:10:56,774 --> 00:11:00,404
(Hyper-focused)

331
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:02,843
Stop!

332
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:04,073
(Stop!)

333
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:05,173
Run?

334
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:07,514
(Time is ticking now.)

335
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:09,383
- Stop!
- Run.

336
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:10,513
(Run!)

337
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:12,654
- Why must I run?
- You have to go up.

338
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,183
(Hurry up and match the cards.)

339
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:20,064
Plane. Helicopter. Ship. Helicopter and ship.

340
00:11:20,494 --> 00:11:22,793
Plane. Car.

341
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:24,663
(He keeps mumbling not to forget what he memorized.)

342
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:27,904
Matching a pair of cards will be impressive.

343
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,303
(Se Yoon)

344
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:32,874
Good luck!

345
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:34,603
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

346
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:36,273
- Stop that.
- All right. Welcome.

347
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:37,414
Good luck!

348
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:39,673
(DinDin is almost on the deck too.)

349
00:11:39,674 --> 00:11:42,013
- All right. Welcome.
- DinDin, good luck.

350
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:43,014
- Good luck.
- Get out of my way.

351
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:44,095
- Broccoli.
- You got this!

352
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:45,253
- All right.
- Broccoli.

353
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:46,313
- Good luck.
- Helicopter.

354
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:47,723
- Car.
- I know that one.

355
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:49,353
- Car. I'll go first.
- He doesn't know! That's not it.

356
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:50,723
- I'll go first.
- That's not the right one.

357
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:52,653
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

358
00:11:52,654 --> 00:11:55,293
Here's the car.

359
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:57,264
- I'll go. This is a car.
- Okay.

360
00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:59,864
Helicopter. Ship. Plane. Car.

361
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:03,674
(He correctly matches the car card.)

362
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:06,274
(Impressed)

363
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:08,873
Just flip a card. Pick the card you know, Se Yoon.

364
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:10,173
- Flip it.
- Flip it?

365
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:12,274
(He trusts DinDin and picks a random card.)

366
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:13,814
- That's a melon.
- Melon.

367
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:15,914
The melon card must be here.

368
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:18,814
- This must be the melon card.
- Okay. The napa cabbage.

369
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:20,023
- Okay.
- My gosh.

370
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:21,123
- The napa cabbage.
- He's good.

371
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:22,760
- The napa cabbage.
- You're good at this.

372
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,853
(Relieved)

373
00:12:24,854 --> 00:12:26,323
- The helicopter.
- Flip it.

374
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:27,324
- Where's the helicopter?
- The helicopter?

375
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:28,324
- Flip it.
- Helicopter.

376
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:29,563
- I know where it is.
- Helicopter.

377
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:31,164
- Helicopter.
- He can't get it, though.

378
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:33,094
- He flipped a peach!
- Peach.

379
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:34,403
- My gosh.
- Peach.

380
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:35,563
(He doesn't seem confident.)

381
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:38,004
- Flip it. I'll do the squats.
- DinDin could match the card.

382
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:39,673
(Can he?)

383
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:40,773
- Just flip it.
- It's wrong.

384
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:42,504
- Rose.
- Rose. I know that one.

385
00:12:42,644 --> 00:12:43,774
- Broccoli.
- Rose.

386
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:45,813
(Seon Ho starts doing 20 squats.)

387
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:47,483
(It's their first incorrect match.)

388
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:48,643
This is broccoli. This one is rose then.

389
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,253
- It hurts.
- Yes.

390
00:12:50,254 --> 00:12:51,254
(Ringing)

391
00:12:51,514 --> 00:12:52,813
This is broccoli. This one is rose then.

392
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,523
- That's the rose card? Okay.
- Hurry up.

393
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,253
- My bottom hurts.
- Hurry up!

394
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:57,494
- How many did he do?
- Twelve.

395
00:12:57,654 --> 00:12:59,323
- Thirteen.
- Rose.

396
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:00,363
- Fifteen.
- That hurts.

397
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:01,863
- My bottom hurts.
- It's fine.

398
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,324
- Seventeen.
- My bottom hurts.

399
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:05,863
- Okay.
- You couldn't find...

400
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:07,764
- Rose. Okay.
- I should...

401
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:09,263
I should move.

402
00:13:09,264 --> 00:13:10,503
It's better to do squats.

403
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:11,573
- Flip that.
- Doing squats is better.

404
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:12,873
- Flip the card you know.
- My brain will explode.

405
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:13,903
- Seriously. It's so hard.
- Banana.

406
00:13:13,904 --> 00:13:16,203
- Banana.
- Banana.

407
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:17,513
It's not there. It's the one over there.

408
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:18,543
- It's been three minutes.
- It's the one next to that.

409
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:19,990
- Three minutes.
- It's the one next to that.

410
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:21,813
- Three.
- Helicopter.

411
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:23,714
- Helicopter. Ship.
- Helicobacter?

412
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:25,083
Helicobacter pylori.

413
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:26,453
(Helicobacter pylori)

414
00:13:26,454 --> 00:13:27,723
(Their distraction tactic must have worked. He gets it wrong.)

415
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,884
- Orange.
- Orange.

416
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:30,424
I'm sorry about that.

417
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:32,793
- Orange.
- Orange.

418
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:34,593
- I'm sorry.
- Didn't you say they could go back?

419
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:36,193
- They can go back once.
- My bottom hurts.

420
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:37,593
Was it the one in the middle?

421
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:38,834
Find the helicopter card.

422
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:40,303
My bottom hurts.

423
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:41,533
We located the banana.

424
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,203
- No one is paying attention to me.
- What's this one?

425
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:44,234
What?

426
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:45,773
- Sixteen, - Hurry up.

427
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:48,704
Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

428
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:49,903
- My bottom hurts.
- What's this one?

429
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:50,913
Helicopter.

430
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,913
- It's peach!
- You flipped that one before.

431
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:53,983
Helicopter.

432
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:55,313
- It's peach!
- You flipped that one before.

433
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:57,353
- You flipped that earlier.
- He picked that earlier.

434
00:13:57,354 --> 00:13:58,554
What are you doing?

435
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:00,123
- Helicopter.
- Helicobacter pylori.

436
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:02,983
(He flipped the same card only 1 minute ago.)

437
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:04,253
- What's wrong with him?
- He flipped the peach card earlier.

438
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:05,393
- Why did he think...
- Wait. Was it here?

439
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:06,523
- Flip the cactus card.
- Okay.

440
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:07,623
- Just go and check.
- Hurry.

441
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:09,693
- Go and check.
- No.

442
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:11,363
- Just flip a random card.
- Go and check the cards.

443
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:13,193
- Just flip a random one.
- Hurry up.

444
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:14,533
You guys don't know. Just go and check.

445
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:15,563
Go and check.

446
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,564
- We'll lose time.
- Go and check.

447
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,725
- No, we have time left.
- No. The helicopter is here.

448
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:20,643
Hurry.

449
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:21,973
- My bottom hurts.
- My gosh. We have it in the bag.

450
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:23,444
Can you locate the carrot?

451
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:26,013
Everyone, it's been four minutes. If you're going to check, go now.

452
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:28,444
(So far, they correctly matched only 3 pairs.)

453
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,083
- Go and check!
- Sunflower!

454
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:32,753
- Sunflower.
- That wasn't on the board.

455
00:14:32,754 --> 00:14:34,324
- Let's go and check.
- Do it again.

456
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:36,583
- Let's go and check.
- Do it again.

457
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,054
Do 20 squats and wait.

458
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:39,453
- Let's go and check.
- Do it again.

459
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:41,063
(They study Seon Ho's face and run away.)

460
00:14:41,064 --> 00:14:42,424
Se Yoon. Let's go down.

461
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:45,170
Forget about my burning thighs. My bottom hurts from the bell.

462
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:46,293
- My gosh.
- Or...

463
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:47,503
(As they got it wrong, he must do the squats again.)

464
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:49,544
Should we focus on memorizing transportation cards?

465
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:50,803
Or we can only memorize fruit cards.

466
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:51,804
- Right.
- Yes.

467
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:53,903
- One person can memorize fruits.
- They're back already?

468
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:55,303
The other one can only memorize fruits.

469
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:56,374
(A lonely battle)

470
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,073
- Check the transportation cards.
- Hey. Memorize just one category.

471
00:14:58,074 --> 00:14:59,473
I'll check the fruits.

472
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:02,013
I can locate the helicopter, the ship, and the plane.

473
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:03,953
- I should check the fruits then?
- Memorize the transportation cards.

474
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:05,553
- I'll do that. You, transportation.
- Transportation. Okay.

475
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:07,483
- I know the transportation cards.
- Transportation. Okay.

476
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:09,100
- I'll do transportation.
- I can locate them all.

477
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:11,493
- I'll do transportation.
- I'll do the fruits.

478
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,653
The rest is up to our luck.

479
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:13,693
(They have 2 minutes and 30 seconds remaining.)

480
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:15,423
I'll give you 15 seconds.

481
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:16,594
- Fifteen seconds?
- Yes.

482
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:18,793
Ready, set, go.

483
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,834
(The board is revealed for 15 more seconds.)

484
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:27,644
(Why don't you try memorizing the cards too?)

485
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:29,673
(Diligently memorizing the fruit cards)

486
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:31,414
Apple, orange, and banana.

487
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:34,584
Bicycle. Ship. Helicopter.

488
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:36,813
(Using his fingers to memorize the transportation cards)

489
00:15:36,814 --> 00:15:38,584
- Five, four, - Bicycle.

490
00:15:38,714 --> 00:15:39,953
- Ship. Helicopter.
- three,

491
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:42,553
two, one. Stop.

492
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:43,623
Slowly.

493
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:44,793
Hold on. Open it.

494
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:46,154
- Time's up.
- Hold on.

495
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:49,863
(He's out of control.)

496
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:51,533
Let me check the ship.

497
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,603
(He forcefully looked at the board for 5 more seconds.)

498
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:56,663
All right. Ship. Helicopter.

499
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,274
(Then he starts running.)

500
00:16:00,704 --> 00:16:02,574
(The gunman is back.)

501
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:06,813
(He kicks instead of shooting his gun this time.)

502
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:08,013
Car. Broccoli. Grape.

503
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:10,014
(DinDin is mumbling again.)

504
00:16:10,784 --> 00:16:11,784
(Get my kick!)

505
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:13,083
- Car. Broccoli. Grape.
- Good luck.

506
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:14,623
What? What's that?

507
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:16,354
- Good luck.
- That's the bicycle card.

508
00:16:16,624 --> 00:16:17,923
- That's not it.
- Good luck.

509
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:20,364
That's the bicycle card. I memorized the car and the bicycle.

510
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:28,363
(He used his entire body to memorize the transportation cards.)

511
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:29,364
Helicopter.

512
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:31,103
I memorized the car and the bicycle.

513
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:33,003
- Okay. Flip it.
- It's sunflower.

514
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:35,404
(Sunflower!)

515
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:37,320
- Sunflower.
- It's okay. I know where it is.

516
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:38,344
(Come on, Se Yoon.)

517
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:39,544
- What?
- Sunflower.

518
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:43,544
(He opens up the sunflower card 2 times in a row.)

519
00:16:43,814 --> 00:16:45,914
(Se Yoon, I love you for being bad at this game.)

520
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:48,053
- Sunflower.
- It's okay. I know where it is.

521
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:49,253
- I can locate it.
- What?

522
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:50,293
- Sunflower.
- We got that earlier.

523
00:16:50,294 --> 00:16:51,453
- Ship.
- Come on.

524
00:16:51,454 --> 00:16:53,693
How many times did Se Yoon flip the sunflower card?

525
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:54,994
- Ship.
- Okay.

526
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:56,594
Ship.

527
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:58,193
(The transportation expert)

528
00:16:58,194 --> 00:16:59,434
Helicopter. Ship.

529
00:16:59,794 --> 00:17:01,104
- Flip it.
- Helicopter.

530
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:02,963
- Helicopter.
- Okay. I located the helicopter.

531
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:04,474
- Okay. I got it.
- My gosh.

532
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,303
You're good.

533
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:07,403
- Can you locate the bicycle?
- They're so good.

534
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:08,843
- The bicycle.
- The bicycle.

535
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:09,943
The bicycle. Okay.

536
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,013
(This time, he locates the bicycle.)

537
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:12,244
- The bicycle.
- The bicycle.

538
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:14,583
- Okay. Flip the food cards next.
- You're good.

539
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:15,843
You didn't memorize food cards, right?

540
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:17,653
It's been six minutes!

541
00:17:17,654 --> 00:17:19,283
Okay. Flip the food cards next.

542
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:20,623
- You didn't memorize food cards.
- Six minutes!

543
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:21,823
- Just flip a random card.
- Just flip a random one.

544
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:23,024
(Se Yoon picks a random card.)

545
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:24,523
- We forgot about the plane.
- Plane.

546
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:25,653
Helicopter. Ship. Plane.

547
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:26,723
- Okay.
- Okay.

548
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:27,964
(They correctly match 8 pairs.)

549
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:30,064
- Flip a random card.
- They're so good.

550
00:17:30,894 --> 00:17:32,433
- Napa cabbage.
- Napa cabbage.

551
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:34,303
- Is this it? Isn't it this one?
- It's this one.

552
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,663
- No.
- I told you it wasn't!

553
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:36,664
- Come on.
- Do 20.

554
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:39,134
This is the napa cabbage card. Seon Ho, hurry.

555
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:42,143
- Don't push me down.
- It's your last 30 seconds.

556
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,014
- Thirty seconds!
- Don't push me down.

557
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:45,474
- Don't push me down.
- No.

558
00:17:46,414 --> 00:17:49,484
(I'm sorry, Seon Ho.)

559
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:51,813
(Thanks to Se Yoon, he finishes the squats fast.)

560
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:53,553
Se Yoon. Flip the napa cabbage card.

561
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:54,853
The napa cabbage. Is this it?

562
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:57,053
- Yes, that's the one.
- It's this one.

563
00:17:57,054 --> 00:17:58,553
- That one.
- This one?

564
00:17:58,554 --> 00:18:00,123
- It's that one!
- It's the one on the bottom.

565
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:01,723
- It's that one.
- Ten seconds!

566
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:03,934
- Just give up.
- Flip a random card.

567
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:05,093
- That one.
- Okay.

568
00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:06,663
- It won't work. Give up.
- Cactus.

569
00:18:06,664 --> 00:18:08,603
- Isn't that the card?
- No, it's this one.

570
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:09,663
- That one.
- No, it's this one.

571
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:11,503
- Isn't that the card?
- No, it's this one.

572
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:13,304
- Three, two, - No, it's this one.

573
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:14,924
- Pick anything. This one.
- one.

574
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:16,543
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

575
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:17,673
- We matched a lot of pairs.
- The last one...

576
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:19,273
- We matched a lot of pairs.
- Flip the last one.

577
00:18:19,274 --> 00:18:20,843
- You matched a lot of pairs.
- We matched a lot of pairs.

578
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:21,844
- Right.
- Yes.

579
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:23,514
Team Se Yoon matched ten pairs.

580
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:24,954
That's a lot.

581
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:27,223
- I must check on my wound.
- Well done.

582
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:28,423
- You did well.
- I did?

583
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:29,724
- Wounds will heal.
- Okay.

584
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:31,353
Did you do 100 squats?

585
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:32,453
(Team Jong Min will go next.)

586
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:35,000
- Hey, you must do a lot of squats.
- The left side is revealed...

587
00:18:35,024 --> 00:18:36,704
- You must do them fast.
- I'm super fast.

588
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:38,333
Then we can keep going.

589
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,363
That's great.

590
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:40,503
- Right?
- Yes.

591
00:18:40,504 --> 00:18:43,163
- We can flip every card.
- Okay.

592
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,533
That's good.

593
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:45,903
But should we focus on memorizing...

594
00:18:45,904 --> 00:18:47,303
- food and transportation?
- Okay.

595
00:18:47,304 --> 00:18:49,650
- What if there's no transportation?
- No transportation cards?

596
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:51,143
Let's memorize things we can put in our mouth.

597
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:53,290
(Let's memorize things we can put in our mouth first.)

598
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:55,314
- We can't put roses in our mouth.
- I can.

599
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:57,053
So you would memorize that?

600
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,713
- Okay.
- Yes. You get it, right?

601
00:18:58,714 --> 00:19:00,653
- I can put sunflowers in my mouth.
- That's it.

602
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:01,724
Okay.

603
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:03,023
- Jong Min.
- Yes.

604
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:04,053
Focus on food.

605
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:05,694
- Things we can put in our mouth.
- Okay.

606
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:09,124
Jong Min sometimes has these genius moments.

607
00:19:10,564 --> 00:19:13,033
(Jong Min always performed well with card-flipping games.)

608
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:15,354
(Jong Min always performed well with card-flipping games.)

609
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:17,933
His short-term memory is good.

610
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:19,473
(Will he able to lead his team to victory again today?)

611
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:20,844
All right. Get ready,

612
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:22,674
set...

613
00:19:23,504 --> 00:19:25,114
(Go!)

614
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:27,383
(Owl, donut, clock, umbrella, chicken, frog, fan, hat, )

615
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:28,783
(chicken, bag, monkey, cake, hamburger, pizza, deer, panda...)

616
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:30,913
(Panda, bag, dragon, television, umbrella, elephant, pizza, pig, )

617
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:33,053
(deer, giraffe, owl, cake, donut, ice cream, rabbit, hat...)

618
00:19:33,054 --> 00:19:34,753
(Owl, donut, clock, umbrella, chicken, frog, fan, hat, )

619
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:36,353
(chicken, bag, monkey, cake, hamburger, pizza, deer, panda, )

620
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:38,530
(dragon, rabbit, television, puppy, pig, ice cream, giraffe, elephant)

621
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,593
(Why don't you try memorizing the cards too?)

622
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:42,223
(Panda, bag, dragon, television, owl, donut, clock, umbrella, )

623
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,763
(umbrella, elephant, pizza, pig, chicken, frog, fan, hat, )

624
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:45,393
(deer, giraffe, owl, cake, chicken, bag, monkey, cake, )

625
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,033
(donut, ice cream, rabbit, hat, hamburger, pizza, deer, panda...)

626
00:19:47,034 --> 00:19:48,703
You have ten seconds left.

627
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:49,763
(monkey, clock, chicken, frog, )

628
00:19:49,764 --> 00:19:50,973
(dragon, rabbit, television, puppy, hamburger...)

629
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:54,774
(It seems there are many food cards.)

630
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:57,573
That's it!

631
00:19:57,574 --> 00:20:00,044
(Their 30 seconds are up.)

632
00:20:00,374 --> 00:20:05,584
(It's time to go up quickly and match the cards.)

633
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,154
(Get out of my way.)

634
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:12,353
(Team Se Yoon continues to distract him despite the threat.)

635
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:14,424
I surrender.

636
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:16,393
(Didn't I make myself clear?)

637
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:19,994
(I told you to get out of my way.)

638
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:22,403
(Sae Ho from the 1st floor arrives too.)

639
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:23,734
- Don't do that.
- Hey.

640
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:25,173
- Okay. What is it?
- Hello.

641
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,703
(Yelling at him)

642
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:27,843
Panda and dragon.

643
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:30,003
(Their distraction tactic gets aggressive once Sae Ho arrives.)

644
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:31,013
- My gosh. They're worse...
- Panda and dragon.

645
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:32,043
- Right now - Dragon.

646
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:34,584
- Isn't this too much?
- Dragon.

647
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,813
(They end up wasting 1 minute due to the noise.)

648
00:20:37,814 --> 00:20:38,984
Elephant and pig.

649
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:41,153
- Which one? Dragon.
- Panda and dragon.

650
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:42,653
Dragon.

651
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:44,754
- Dragon.
- Dragon.

652
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:49,693
(Will Jong Min be able to find the dragon card?)

653
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:50,893
- Dragon.
- Dragon.

654
00:20:50,894 --> 00:20:52,033
Dragon.

655
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:53,364
- There you go!
- One pair.

656
00:20:53,664 --> 00:20:54,733
(They match 1 pair.)

657
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:56,263
- Panda, dragon, elephant, and pig.
- I bet you're annoyed

658
00:20:56,264 --> 00:20:57,503
- I bet you're annoyed - Deer, owl, and giraffe.

659
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:59,003
- Deer, owl, and giraffe.
- I bet you're annoyed

660
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:00,473
- Owl.
- Owl.

661
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:01,903
- Owl.
- Owl.

662
00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:03,174
I bet you're annoyed

663
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:04,673
Owl. Let's go.

664
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:05,843
- Okay.
- Okay.

665
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:06,844
- I bet - Okay.

666
00:21:07,144 --> 00:21:08,743
(Wait. They're pretty good.)

667
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:10,513
- Donut.
- Donut.

668
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:13,413
- Hamburger.
- Hamburger.

669
00:21:13,414 --> 00:21:14,423
- Hamburger.
- For real?

670
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:15,424
Hamburger.

671
00:21:15,425 --> 00:21:17,183
- My gosh.
- What about the donut?

672
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,723
(Jong Min once again proves himself to be an ace with the card game.)

673
00:21:19,724 --> 00:21:21,824
- Donut.
- Donut.

674
00:21:22,224 --> 00:21:23,963
(I know that one.)

675
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:25,993
(Jong Min flips the correct card.)

676
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,263
I bet you're annoyed

677
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:29,180
- It's not the donut.
- It's ice cream. Go. Let's go.

678
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,503
I bet you're annoyed

679
00:21:30,504 --> 00:21:33,034
(It's their first incorrect answer.)

680
00:21:34,444 --> 00:21:35,843
(Joon can do squats faster than anyone.)

681
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:37,043
- Eight.
- I'm good with ice cream.

682
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:38,443
Deer, giraffe, and owl.

683
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:41,213
- Hold on.
- It has to ring.

684
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:43,584
(These squats are more painful than he thought.)

685
00:21:43,914 --> 00:21:45,153
(Invalid)

686
00:21:45,154 --> 00:21:46,154
(12 squats)

687
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:48,453
(The most difficult thing to put up with right now...)

688
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:51,023
(is the indifference from his team.)

689
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:52,554
This is tough.

690
00:21:52,754 --> 00:21:54,464
- I know how you feel now.
- But...

691
00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:55,824
- Twenty.
- This is...

692
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:57,223
That hurts.

693
00:21:57,224 --> 00:22:00,634
We have to get rid of the bell. That hurts so much.

694
00:22:00,934 --> 00:22:01,963
- Car.
- Ice cream.

695
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:03,263
- Ice cream.
- Ice cream.

696
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,103
- It's been two minutes.
- Ice cream.

697
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:06,104
(When Sae Ho picks a card, Jong Min matches it.)

698
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:07,204
Ice cream.

699
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:08,973
Gosh, Jong Min is no joke.

700
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:10,473
- Jong Min is good at this.
- Which one?

701
00:22:10,474 --> 00:22:11,873
Deer. Deer, giraffe, and owl. Anything from there?

702
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,313
- Deer.
- Deer.

703
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:15,544
- All right. Deer.
- Okay. Panda girl.

704
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:18,054
- Elephant.
- Panda, dragon, and elephant.

705
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:22,023
(He must locate the elephant.)

706
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:23,223
- Panda girl.
- Elephant.

707
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:24,770
- Panda, dragon, and elephant.
- Elephant.

708
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:26,023
- Elephant.
- Okay.

709
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:27,363
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Pig.

710
00:22:27,364 --> 00:22:29,093
- But this is...
- The bell has to ring.

711
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:31,134
If you do it fast, it hurts.

712
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:32,433
- No.
- Bend your knees more.

713
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,133
(His speed is dropping due to the unexpected pain.)

714
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:36,763
- You go first.
- Deer.

715
00:22:36,764 --> 00:22:38,073
- Okay.
- Deer.

716
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:39,934
No. You can't flip it yet.

717
00:22:40,844 --> 00:22:43,243
- Hurry up.
- Hey, you must hurry.

718
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:45,173
This is a lonely position.

719
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:46,274
(I feel utterly lonely.)

720
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:47,583
Hold on.

721
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:49,420
- This is a lonely position.
- Gosh, one time...

722
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:50,644
- Deer.
- I know how it feels.

723
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:52,154
- Deer.
- Deer.

724
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:53,584
- Deer.
- I know how it feels.

725
00:22:53,684 --> 00:22:55,023
Okay.

726
00:22:55,024 --> 00:22:56,954
(It's a puppy, not a deer.)

727
00:22:57,054 --> 00:22:58,753
- Okay.
- Let's go back.

728
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:00,424
- Let's go back.
- We'll go and check.

729
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:01,763
Okay.

730
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:03,563
(Team Jong Min quickly decides to check unlike team Se Yoon.)

731
00:23:03,564 --> 00:23:04,733
This really hurts.

732
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:06,493
Hey, what should we memorize first? The animals?

733
00:23:06,494 --> 00:23:09,833
Memorize animals first. Animals and stuff. You know?

734
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:10,874
Okay.

735
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:13,333
- We have to nail it this time.
- How many seconds do we get?

736
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:15,014
(Let's memorize them correctly this time.)

737
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,674
- Okay.
- All right.

738
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:19,243
The deer was over there. Panda.

739
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:20,690
(They get extra 15 seconds to review.)

740
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:21,913
- My gosh.
- This is...

741
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:24,684
(Focused)

742
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:29,483
(Why don't you try memorizing the cards too?)

743
00:23:29,484 --> 00:23:31,053
- Memorize the animals.
- Five seconds.

744
00:23:31,054 --> 00:23:32,553
(Hamburger, puppy, fan, chicken, pig, ice cream, giraffe, elephant)

745
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:33,593
That's it.

746
00:23:33,594 --> 00:23:36,364
(Their extra time is up.)

747
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:37,764
I'm confused.

748
00:23:39,564 --> 00:23:41,633
(How many more cards were they able to memorize?)

749
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:44,673
A car and a plane

750
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,573
(Shooting)

751
00:23:46,574 --> 00:23:48,903
- A plane and a car - You keep shooting your gun.

752
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:50,003
(You keep shooting your gun.)

753
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:52,143
- A plane and a car - Which one do you want to do?

754
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:53,264
- A plane and a car - Puppy.

755
00:23:53,514 --> 00:23:54,543
- Puppy.
- Puppy.

756
00:23:54,544 --> 00:23:56,213
- A plane and a car - Puppy.

757
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:57,913
- Okay. Do 20.
- My gosh.

758
00:23:57,914 --> 00:23:59,153
- What? Why did you get that wrong?
- That's elephant.

759
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:00,213
Guess who that is.

760
00:24:00,214 --> 00:24:01,753
- You can't flip it now.
- I know now.

761
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:03,053
- Elephant.
- Okay.

762
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:04,424
- You can't flip it now.
- Okay.

763
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,394
Four minutes.

764
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:09,363
- What?
- Hurry!

765
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,393
Puppy? What is it?

766
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:11,533
- No, locate the elephant.
- You can't flip it now.

767
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:12,563
- Elephant.
- Not now.

768
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:14,710
- Let's locate the puppy next.
- You can't flip it now.

769
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:15,963
- All done.
- Elephant.

770
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:17,704
- Elephant.
- Elephant.

771
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:20,634
- Okay. Locate the puppy.
- Puppy.

772
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:22,204
- Puppy. Pig.
- My gosh.

773
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:23,944
- Pig.
- Flip the pig card?

774
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,014
- Pig.
- Pig pizza!

775
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:27,513
- Fiji.
- One, two, three.

776
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:28,683
- Okay. Pig.
- My gosh.

777
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:29,684
- Pizza.
- Jong Min is good.

778
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:30,783
- Pizza?
- Pizza.

779
00:24:30,784 --> 00:24:32,653
- I'm confused between these two.
- Let's pick a different one.

780
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:33,683
Flip both cards.

781
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:35,453
- Chicken.
- Chicken.

782
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:36,853
- Chicken.
- The chicken card is right here.

783
00:24:36,854 --> 00:24:38,123
- This is the chicken.
- It's this one.

784
00:24:38,124 --> 00:24:39,793
- Do you know where the panda is?
- I know where it is.

785
00:24:39,794 --> 00:24:41,093
- The panda is this one.
- Panda.

786
00:24:41,094 --> 00:24:42,563
- Panda.
- Panda.

787
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,623
Deer.

788
00:24:43,624 --> 00:24:44,934
- Deer?
- Yes.

789
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:46,034
I don't know where it is.

790
00:24:46,035 --> 00:24:48,304
Frog. Deer. Giraffe.

791
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:50,034
- Giraffe.
- Giraffe.

792
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:51,534
- Let's see.
- All right.

793
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:53,004
- Giraffe.
- Giraffe.

794
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:54,473
- Okay.
- Where's the deer?

795
00:24:54,474 --> 00:24:55,773
Deer? It's confusing where it is.

796
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:56,904
Isn't this the deer?

797
00:24:57,404 --> 00:24:58,513
(I don't know where the deer is.)

798
00:24:58,514 --> 00:24:59,673
- Pizza.
- I don't know either.

799
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:00,843
- Pizza.
- Isn't this the pizza?

800
00:25:00,844 --> 00:25:01,883
- Pizza.
- I don't know either.

801
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:04,414
(Sae Ho flips the pizza card.)

802
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:07,283
(What about Jong Min?)

803
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:08,453
- Pizza? Goodness.
- Oh, no.

804
00:25:08,454 --> 00:25:09,954
- Okay.
- Where's the donut?

805
00:25:10,254 --> 00:25:11,823
(They got 10 pairs correct.)

806
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:12,894
Where's the donut?

807
00:25:13,194 --> 00:25:14,723
(Soon, their score ties with Team Se Yoon's.)

808
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:15,724
Where's the donut?

809
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:16,994
- Donut.
- Donut.

810
00:25:17,164 --> 00:25:18,833
(They need to get one more pair right.)

811
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:19,963
- Okay.
- Donut.

812
00:25:19,964 --> 00:25:21,134
- Donut.
- Donut.

813
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:22,633
- Okay.
- Donut.

814
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:23,803
- It's the clock.
- Clock.

815
00:25:23,804 --> 00:25:25,303
Is this the donut?

816
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:26,304
You have to do 20 squats.

817
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:28,103
- Two.
- This is the clock card.

818
00:25:28,104 --> 00:25:29,273
Our scores are tied.

819
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:30,474
How many minutes do they have?

820
00:25:30,914 --> 00:25:32,413
It's been 5 minutes and 40 seconds.

821
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:33,474
- Frog.
- One.

822
00:25:33,714 --> 00:25:35,013
- Where's the clock?
- I don't know where it is.

823
00:25:35,014 --> 00:25:36,113
- That's not it.
- Isn't this the clock?

824
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:38,114
- Is this the clock?
- The time isn't up yet.

825
00:25:39,554 --> 00:25:42,024
The bell is ringing.

826
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:43,823
- Clock.
- Clock.

827
00:25:43,824 --> 00:25:46,753
(He did 20 squats in 11 seconds.)

828
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:47,893
- Clock.
- Okay, clock.

829
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:48,894
No!

830
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:51,970
(If Jong Min gets it right, their victory will be confirmed.)

831
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:52,343
(Please let it be wrong.)

832
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:52,617
- Clock.
- Okay, clock.

833
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:53,656
No!

834
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:56,702
(If Jong Min gets it right, their victory will be confirmed.)

835
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:58,196
(Please let it be wrong.)

836
00:25:58,666 --> 00:25:59,835
- Clock.
- Okay, clock.

837
00:25:59,836 --> 00:26:00,836
No!

838
00:26:00,837 --> 00:26:02,536
- It's the clock.
- Okay, are we done?

839
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:03,735
(Team Se Yoon lost.)

840
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:05,705
- We lost.
- Give it a try.

841
00:26:05,706 --> 00:26:08,275
- Donut. Instead of the donut...
- What else?

842
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:09,705
I think that this is the deer.

843
00:26:09,706 --> 00:26:11,345
- No, not the deer.
- Seriously?

844
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:12,475
- Something other than the deer.
- Chicken.

845
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:14,416
- Chicken.
- Chicken.

846
00:26:14,576 --> 00:26:15,775
Here's the chicken.

847
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:17,145
- Okay.
- Chicken.

848
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:18,715
- What about the frog?
- Just flip it.

849
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:19,856
- Frog.
- Okay.

850
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:21,655
I have to make a guess.

851
00:26:21,656 --> 00:26:23,195
- Jong Min is good at this.
- Jong Min is...

852
00:26:23,196 --> 00:26:25,195
This is confusing. Gosh, it's the deer.

853
00:26:25,196 --> 00:26:26,465
- This is the deer.
- Hurry up.

854
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:28,436
Hurry and do 20 more squats.

855
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,805
- Hurry up.
- Do them faster.

856
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:32,506
- You should help him.
- Faster.

857
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:34,375
Faster.

858
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:36,076
- Please do them fast.
- Faster.

859
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:38,246
You must keep going even if your pants get pierced.

860
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:40,575
It's the deer.

861
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:42,016
- Goodness.
- Okay, let's go.

862
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,045
- Another one?
- How about the donut?

863
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:45,686
There's a hole in his pants.

864
00:26:47,616 --> 00:26:48,755
(Is it true?)

865
00:26:48,756 --> 00:26:50,855
- Where are you looking at?
- I really got a hole.

866
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:51,925
Let me see.

867
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:53,956
- Darn it.
- Twenty.

868
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:55,955
- Do you see it?
- What?

869
00:26:55,956 --> 00:26:57,766
- Darn it.
- What's going on?

870
00:26:58,026 --> 00:26:59,866
- How could this happen?
- His pants got torn.

871
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,335
How...

872
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:02,535
- There's really a hole.
- Let me see.

873
00:27:02,536 --> 00:27:04,305
- Gosh.
- Oh, my. It's true.

874
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:06,035
- Three, two, - He got a hole.

875
00:27:06,036 --> 00:27:07,196
- one.
- This is humiliating.

876
00:27:07,436 --> 00:27:08,535
(The game is over with the hole.)

877
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:10,805
I can't believe that my pants got pierced.

878
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:12,105
- What?
- Show it to the camera.

879
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:13,245
- No way.
- Show it to them.

880
00:27:13,246 --> 00:27:14,715
- Why would I show...
- Joon.

881
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,185
- this to them?
- You got paid to be on the show.

882
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:17,816
The viewers have the right to know.

883
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:20,115
Here's the result of the first mission.

884
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:21,885
Team Se Yoon got ten.

885
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:23,585
Team Jong Min got...

886
00:27:23,586 --> 00:27:25,385
thirteen.

887
00:27:25,386 --> 00:27:26,395
Okay.

888
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:27,996
- Team Jong Min won.
- Yes.

889
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:29,255
All right.

890
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:31,365
You won six slots.

891
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:32,466
- Gosh.
- Really?

892
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:33,765
We won a lot.

893
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:35,565
Don't let Se Yoon do things that require thinking.

894
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:37,536
You're right. I'm much better than him.

895
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:40,106
He flipped the sunflower card four times.

896
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:41,805
Now,

897
00:27:41,806 --> 00:27:43,745
- let's move to the next location.
- Let's go.

898
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:44,746
Let's go.

899
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,246
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

900
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:48,616
Autumn is here.

901
00:27:49,016 --> 00:27:51,586
Overflowing with feelings and appetite.

902
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:53,415
In season all year round.

903
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:55,386
A variety show of laughter at its core.

904
00:27:55,786 --> 00:27:57,056
Who are we?

905
00:27:57,256 --> 00:28:00,556
- 2 Days.
- 1 Night.

906
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:02,256
Autumn is here.

907
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:04,495
Why did they put 2 opposing teams in 1 bus?

908
00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:05,696
This is uncomfortable.

909
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:07,895
- We can't talk in private.
- Right.

910
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:09,065
- We can't think of tactics either.
- Right.

911
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:11,835
Shall we come up with our team name?

912
00:28:11,836 --> 00:28:12,836
That sounds good.

913
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:15,375
It'd be nice to include "core" in the team name.

914
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:16,446
Something core?

915
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:18,845
Aren't we One Night Core?

916
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:20,045
You're right.

917
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:21,545
Then let's call ourselves Two Days Core.

918
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:23,016
Okay, Two Days Core.

919
00:28:23,216 --> 00:28:24,545
That sounds good.

920
00:28:24,546 --> 00:28:26,562
- They don't make any effort.
- I knew that they'd copy us.

921
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:30,356
When we aim, we aim straight.

922
00:28:30,486 --> 00:28:32,785
How about Jong Cho Joon from Jong Min, Cho Sae Ho, and Lee Joon?

923
00:28:32,786 --> 00:28:34,695
Let's stop making acronyms with our names.

924
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:35,725
Do you not like it?

925
00:28:35,726 --> 00:28:37,695
How many months have we been doing that?

926
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:38,865
We've been doing it for a year.

927
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:40,135
Our team is called Jong Cho Joon.

928
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:42,236
Or Kim Joon Ho.

929
00:28:42,636 --> 00:28:43,706
I know.

930
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,136
How shall we name our team with "core?"

931
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,135
All I can think about is Choi Baek Ho.

932
00:28:48,136 --> 00:28:49,306
Choi Baek-core.

933
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:50,845
Choi Baek Ho?

934
00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:52,505
I can only think of him.

935
00:28:52,506 --> 00:28:54,315
- Choi Baek-core sounds good.
- What?

936
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,415
Choi Baek-core sounds good.

937
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:57,115
(Choi Baek-core sounds perfect.)

938
00:28:57,116 --> 00:28:58,615
About 2 Days 1 Night

939
00:28:58,616 --> 00:28:59,885
- Choi Baek-core.
- Choi Baek-core.

940
00:28:59,886 --> 00:29:01,216
Choi Baek-core sounds good.

941
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:04,026
Is there any core that you want to support?

942
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:05,725
- Your own...
- Humble-core.

943
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:06,726
- Humble-core?
- Yes.

944
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:08,925
- Gentle-core.
- He's obsessed with his image.

945
00:29:08,926 --> 00:29:10,226
It's driving me crazy.

946
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:12,165
It's driving me crazy.

947
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:14,536
A few days ago, I was very exhausted.

948
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:17,436
One of the directors I worked with said to me,

949
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:20,235
"It must be so hard. After coming back from the US,"

950
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:22,306
"you have to go to another shoot right away."

951
00:29:22,436 --> 00:29:24,105
"Life seems difficult for celebrities."

952
00:29:24,106 --> 00:29:26,576
I knew that he was throwing me a curveball.

953
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:29,276
I couldn't just agree with him.

954
00:29:29,786 --> 00:29:31,785
I said, "Life isn't difficult only for celebrities."

955
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:33,615
- "It's hard for everyone."
- Right.

956
00:29:33,616 --> 00:29:34,815
Do you know what his response was?

957
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,726
"I knew it. You're a thoughtful celebrity."

958
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:38,725
It was definitely a curveball.

959
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:40,425
Since when did I become a thoughtful celebrity?

960
00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:42,295
This is really suffocating.

961
00:29:42,296 --> 00:29:44,296
DinDin, you look more positive than before.

962
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:46,695
It's because I'm loved.

963
00:29:46,696 --> 00:29:48,095
That's a good thing.

964
00:29:48,096 --> 00:29:50,465
- I haven't been loved in a while.
- He's very thoughtful.

965
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:52,436
- What's in season right now?
- Gizzard shads.

966
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:54,476
- Did someone order you to ask?
- Shrimp.

967
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,175
I can tell from the look of his face that he was ordered.

968
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:58,046
Jong Min wouldn't follow someone's order.

969
00:29:58,446 --> 00:29:59,945
What was your question again?

970
00:29:59,946 --> 00:30:01,075
What's in season right now?

971
00:30:01,076 --> 00:30:02,915
Yellowtail started being in season right now.

972
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:04,085
- Yellowtail?
- You're right.

973
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:05,285
- What's in season...
- Shrimp.

974
00:30:05,286 --> 00:30:06,615
- Foliage...
- Prawn.

975
00:30:06,616 --> 00:30:08,815
It will be brief, but autumn colors will start to show.

976
00:30:08,816 --> 00:30:10,355
- It will be very brief.
- Autumn colors?

977
00:30:10,356 --> 00:30:12,356
Also, it's the reading season although it's short.

978
00:30:12,426 --> 00:30:14,195
- Reading is the best.
- Reading is in season.

979
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:15,555
Reading is in season.

980
00:30:15,556 --> 00:30:17,295
- How about ballad songs?
- Ballad songs are in season.

981
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:18,825
Ballad songs are the best in autumn.

982
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:20,936
(In autumn, ballad songs are in season.)

983
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:23,266
Actually, autumn is about hiking.

984
00:30:23,566 --> 00:30:24,836
Why hiking?

985
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:26,505
Because the weather is nice and cool.

986
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:27,905
- No way.
- You go out to see fall foliage.

987
00:30:27,906 --> 00:30:30,175
- You go out to see fall foliage.
- Get rid of thoughts like that.

988
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:31,375
You can go alone.

989
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:33,345
You can see a wide view of autumn colors.

990
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:35,216
- I have a question.
- Yes?

991
00:30:35,576 --> 00:30:38,445
Those who want to watch fishing...

992
00:30:38,446 --> 00:30:40,356
- watch the fishing channel.
- Yes.

993
00:30:40,686 --> 00:30:41,985
If you want to watch hiking,

994
00:30:41,986 --> 00:30:43,656
wouldn't you watch the hiking channel?

995
00:30:43,756 --> 00:30:45,856
Do they have to watch us hike?

996
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:48,526
If they want to see everything, they'd watch our show.

997
00:30:49,426 --> 00:30:50,465
That's correct.

998
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:53,666
We're responsible for Korea's core variety show.

999
00:30:54,296 --> 00:30:55,535
- That's right.
- When we stir things up,

1000
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:57,165
everything gets stirred up.

1001
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,535
- That's right.
- Se Yoon.

1002
00:30:58,536 --> 00:30:59,536
Yes?

1003
00:30:59,636 --> 00:31:01,305
If I have to hike, I will.

1004
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:02,535
We're in this together.

1005
00:31:02,536 --> 00:31:04,045
"Isn't hiking difficult?"

1006
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:06,022
"Isn't it much harder right after coming back from abroad?"

1007
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:07,175
I'm not the only one suffering.

1008
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:08,916
Those holding cameras have it worse.

1009
00:31:09,176 --> 00:31:10,315
He's such a thoughtful celebrity.

1010
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:11,645
(Making a comment on thoughtfulness)

1011
00:31:11,646 --> 00:31:12,715
That's DinDin.

1012
00:31:12,716 --> 00:31:15,056
It's been two weeks since he got popular.

1013
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:17,286
He is finally starting to get a little cranky.

1014
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:19,555
When will he show his true side?

1015
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:20,795
He's still thoughtful.

1016
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,625
- "He's still thoughtful?"
- A record on DinDin.

1017
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:24,166
I don't want to go hiking.

1018
00:31:24,726 --> 00:31:27,735
Are we going this deep in the mountain?

1019
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:29,095
Gosh, this is...

1020
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,105
(What's going on?)

1021
00:31:30,106 --> 00:31:31,786
- The bus is going far in.
- This place...

1022
00:31:32,306 --> 00:31:34,175
(They arrive at a place...)

1023
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:35,605
(filled with autumn seasonal flowers.)

1024
00:31:35,606 --> 00:31:37,206
You will find gauras,

1025
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:39,546
crape myrtles, and cosmos.

1026
00:31:39,646 --> 00:31:41,845
It's known as an emotional garden where seasonal flowers...

1027
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:43,486
in autumn bloom in harmony.

1028
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:50,456
(The place is covered with pink during the chilly autumn.)

1029
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:54,095
(A magnificent view of Dodamsambong Peaks...)

1030
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:56,096
(in the background)

1031
00:31:57,566 --> 00:31:59,165
I've been here before.

1032
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,435
- It's a spot to take photos.
- What?

1033
00:32:00,436 --> 00:32:01,965
- I saw this from the other side.
- I'll take photos of you.

1034
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:04,247
- Right, we were over there.
- We were on the other side.

1035
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:08,375
(A picturesque view)

1036
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:09,605
This place is lovely.

1037
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:11,176
- Isn't it?
- It's lovely.

1038
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:12,845
It's so beautiful.

1039
00:32:12,846 --> 00:32:14,315
I've traveled a lot in Korea,

1040
00:32:14,316 --> 00:32:16,276
- and Danyang is very beautiful.
- Come this way.

1041
00:32:16,486 --> 00:32:17,646
You must be new.

1042
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:19,516
Nice to meet you.

1043
00:32:19,686 --> 00:32:21,186
Didn't you meet her last time?

1044
00:32:21,516 --> 00:32:22,585
- We met her last time.
- We met her last time.

1045
00:32:22,586 --> 00:32:23,785
Was she here last time?

1046
00:32:23,786 --> 00:32:25,225
- DinDin.
- What are you doing?

1047
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:26,826
You're a thoughtful celebrity.

1048
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:30,525
Did you pair up with DinDin?

1049
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:32,296
I was wondering where Kingking was.

1050
00:32:32,466 --> 00:32:33,566
- Right.
- Yes.

1051
00:32:33,866 --> 00:32:36,335
His name is Kingking from "The Lion King."

1052
00:32:36,336 --> 00:32:37,882
(Kingking's dad takes care of his teammates.)

1053
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:39,305
Do you see these flowers?

1054
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:40,805
- There are a lot of them.
- Yes.

1055
00:32:40,806 --> 00:32:42,705
- They're called gauras.
- Gauras?

1056
00:32:42,706 --> 00:32:44,405
They're called butterfly needle flowers in Korean.

1057
00:32:44,406 --> 00:32:45,505
- Gauras?
- Yes.

1058
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:46,715
Gaura? Butterfly needle flowers?

1059
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:48,715
They're guaras,

1060
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,416
- and they're also called...
- It's another name.

1061
00:32:51,546 --> 00:32:52,546
Butterfly needle flowers.

1062
00:32:52,547 --> 00:32:53,555
- It has two names.
- Right.

1063
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,285
I thought that they were gaura butterfly needle flowers.

1064
00:32:55,286 --> 00:32:56,925
His legal name is Lim Cheol,

1065
00:32:56,926 --> 00:32:58,626
- but he's called Thoughtful Din.
- Okay.

1066
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,855
Do you get it now?

1067
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:01,995
- I'm DinDin.
- Right, DinDin.

1068
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:03,765
Thoughtful Celebrity DinDin, Thoughtful Din.

1069
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:05,365
My name is DinDin, not Thoughtful Din.

1070
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:07,535
Like he's called DinDin, they're called gauras.

1071
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:10,936
The next mission to enjoy the autumn season-core is...

1072
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:13,535
Autumn Music Quiz that's full of emotion.

1073
00:33:13,536 --> 00:33:14,935
- That's right.
- It sounds difficult.

1074
00:33:14,936 --> 00:33:16,805
- That's right.
- We're bad at this.

1075
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:19,145
- Se Yoon knows a lot about music.
- It's about time.

1076
00:33:19,146 --> 00:33:20,375
Se Yoon knows about music.

1077
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:21,745
- Both Jong Min and I are stuck...
- I like ballad songs.

1078
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:23,745
In music from the 80s and 90s.

1079
00:33:23,746 --> 00:33:26,115
I only listen to music from that period.

1080
00:33:26,116 --> 00:33:28,016
Right, I still haven't changed.

1081
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,525
- We know them all.
- I know the 80s and the 90s.

1082
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:31,885
- The 80s and the 90s.
- He knows the 2000s and the 2010s.

1083
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:34,026
- You know the 2020s.
- We know them all.

1084
00:33:34,656 --> 00:33:37,626
(Before starting the mission, it's time to reveal the team name.)

1085
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:39,396
At the height of our power,

1086
00:33:39,896 --> 00:33:41,366
as fierce as a white tiger.

1087
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:43,206
- Choi Baek-core.
- Choi Baek-core.

1088
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,606
At the height...

1089
00:33:47,136 --> 00:33:48,136
(About 1 Night)

1090
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:50,176
Choi Baek-core!

1091
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:54,175
- Our name is simple.
- We've decided.

1092
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,376
We'd like to aim at the viewers' hearts...

1093
00:33:56,616 --> 00:33:58,586
- and captivate them.
- They must be shooting.

1094
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,716
We're Jong Cho Joon.

1095
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:02,386
See that?

1096
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:04,956
- Isn't it cute?
- It's a toy.

1097
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:07,056
- What?
- All right.

1098
00:34:07,156 --> 00:34:09,525
- You're Choi Baek-core.
- We're Jong Cho Joon.

1099
00:34:09,526 --> 00:34:11,295
- We're Choi Baek-core.
- Jong Cho Joon.

1100
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:12,726
- Okay.
- And this is Kingking.

1101
00:34:12,766 --> 00:34:15,865
Okay. In such a romantic season, music is a must.

1102
00:34:15,866 --> 00:34:17,036
- It's romantic.
- Of course.

1103
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:20,336
Please answer the singer's name and song title accurately.

1104
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:24,175
The first team with all members to guess correctly...

1105
00:34:24,176 --> 00:34:26,406
will win the round.

1106
00:34:26,446 --> 00:34:28,675
The team to win the 1st 2 out of 3 rounds will win.

1107
00:34:28,676 --> 00:34:29,676
(The 1st to win 2 rounds)

1108
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:32,145
- How many slots do we get?
- It's the same.

1109
00:34:32,146 --> 00:34:33,916
- The prize is six slots.
- Okay.

1110
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:37,462
Could you give me some water? I have black pepper in my throat.

1111
00:34:37,486 --> 00:34:38,956
Just throw it.

1112
00:34:40,296 --> 00:34:41,556
DinDin.

1113
00:34:43,296 --> 00:34:46,296
(DinDin is so amazing.)

1114
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:48,795
(Standing ovation)

1115
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,436
Thoughtful Celebrity DinDin.

1116
00:34:50,836 --> 00:34:53,235
(The unique thoughtful celebrity's performance)

1117
00:34:53,236 --> 00:34:54,236
He's the best.

1118
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:55,335
(The unique thoughtful celebrity's performance)

1119
00:34:55,336 --> 00:34:57,075
Some celebrities would have kicked it with their feet.

1120
00:34:57,076 --> 00:34:58,676
(I'm thirsty.)

1121
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,415
(His enthusiastic clapping makes DinDin spit it out.)

1122
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:05,886
I drank from that bottle.

1123
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:07,556
- I drank from it.
- It's difficult.

1124
00:35:08,116 --> 00:35:10,126
Usually, people take new bottles, but he doesn't.

1125
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:13,125
I couldn't be bothered to go up there.

1126
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:15,395
- You're a recycling celebrity.
- Seriously.

1127
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:16,495
He's so amazing.

1128
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:18,796
Kingking, give him a round of applause.

1129
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:22,035
- Kingking is clapping too.
- Goodness.

1130
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,605
Water got all over my face.

1131
00:35:23,606 --> 00:35:25,405
It's amazing how he brought the bottle to Se Yoon.

1132
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:27,436
- I know.
- Give a hug to Kingking.

1133
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:28,836
(Screaming with joy)

1134
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:32,045
(He's kind enough to take Kingking in his arms.)

1135
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,146
Here you go. This is crazy.

1136
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:37,085
I haven't spat out water in a long time.

1137
00:35:37,086 --> 00:35:38,086
(That's Thoughtful Din for you.)

1138
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:39,486
All right. The questions are...

1139
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:42,815
from the 1980s to 2020s.

1140
00:35:42,816 --> 00:35:44,926
They cover a wide range of years.

1141
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:47,766
Se Yoon knows most of the songs from the 1980s and the 1990s.

1142
00:35:47,796 --> 00:35:50,996
The team to answer correctly picks the year for the next song.

1143
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:52,525
- We got it.
- All right.

1144
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:53,565
We will win this.

1145
00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:55,665
Here's the first question.

1146
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:58,206
- Okay.
- Music, please.

1147
00:36:00,276 --> 00:36:01,775
- Choi Baek-core.
- Choi Baek-core?

1148
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:03,252
(Se Yoon responds as soon as he hears it.)

1149
00:36:03,276 --> 00:36:04,545
- Choi Baek-core.
- Choi Baek-core?

1150
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:05,986
"When Autumn Comes" by Lee Moon Sae.

1151
00:36:06,106 --> 00:36:07,816
- Se Yoon is really good at this.
- Right.

1152
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:10,286
Choi Baek-core is correct.

1153
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:14,016
("When Autumn Comes" by Lee Moon Sae)

1154
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:19,256
(A hit song that announces the start of autumn)

1155
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:22,696
(It's beautiful)

1156
00:36:22,796 --> 00:36:26,526
(The voice that melted our hearts back then)

1157
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:28,696
I like you, DinDin.

1158
00:36:29,696 --> 00:36:32,306
It feels so peaceful here...

1159
00:36:33,136 --> 00:36:34,805
that I can't focus on answering the question.

1160
00:36:34,806 --> 00:36:36,646
- Were you listening to the song?
- As soon...

1161
00:36:36,676 --> 00:36:37,906
as I heard the melody,

1162
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:39,306
I thought, "It's lovely."

1163
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:45,585
It's nice to feel at peace.

1164
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:48,016
(Truly feeling the vibe of autumn with music)

1165
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:50,255
- Can I pick the year now?
- That's right.

1166
00:36:50,256 --> 00:36:52,225
- Which year would you like?
- Let's enjoy the romance longer.

1167
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:53,256
Let's do that.

1168
00:36:53,356 --> 00:36:55,755
- I pick the 2020s.
- Yes?

1169
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,266
- The 2020s?
- Let's do this.

1170
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,825
(He doesn't feel confident.)

1171
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,635
The other team doesn't know anything.

1172
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,335
- Seon Ho, get ready.
- I will.

1173
00:37:03,336 --> 00:37:05,635
- DinDin knows a lot too.
- These are current songs.

1174
00:37:05,636 --> 00:37:07,035
- Right.
- Right?

1175
00:37:07,036 --> 00:37:08,906
Music, please.

1176
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:12,606
- Jong Min.
- Seon Ho.

1177
00:37:14,046 --> 00:37:15,545
(Jong Min was faster.)

1178
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:18,186
- No. I mean, Jong Cho Joon.
- What is it? Choi Baek-core.

1179
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:20,356
- "Youth."
- What?

1180
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:21,786
By whom?

1181
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:23,086
Who?

1182
00:37:24,086 --> 00:37:26,626
"Youth" by... Kim Feel.

1183
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:28,525
- It's wrong.
- Wrong.

1184
00:37:28,526 --> 00:37:29,526
- You know it, right?
- I know.

1185
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:31,272
- I'm confused about the title.
- It's our turn anyway.

1186
00:37:31,296 --> 00:37:32,325
You don't know this song?

1187
00:37:32,326 --> 00:37:33,595
I know.

1188
00:37:33,596 --> 00:37:34,672
(Se Yoon doesn't have a chance to answer.)

1189
00:37:34,696 --> 00:37:36,565
- Three, two...
- Seon Ho.

1190
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,535
- Should I not say it?
- It's Choi Baek-core.

1191
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:40,376
- It might help them.
- You're right.

1192
00:37:40,636 --> 00:37:42,106
- Wrong.
- Jong Cho Joon.

1193
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:43,975
- It's by Jannabi.
- That's right.

1194
00:37:43,976 --> 00:37:45,046
It's by Jannabi.

1195
00:37:46,246 --> 00:37:48,546
- Three, two, - Oh, my gosh. By Jannabi...

1196
00:37:48,946 --> 00:37:50,145
- By Jannabi...
- one.

1197
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:51,146
- "Autumn."
- By Jannabi.

1198
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:52,485
What's the song title?

1199
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:54,116
- Wrong.
- The title is...

1200
00:37:54,186 --> 00:37:55,685
I love this song.

1201
00:37:55,686 --> 00:37:57,085
I remember.

1202
00:37:57,086 --> 00:38:00,096
The album cover is blue and white.

1203
00:38:01,596 --> 00:38:04,766
(Do you know which song it is?)

1204
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:09,496
(The answer is "A Thought on an Autumn Night" by Jannabi.)

1205
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:11,035
What's the song called?

1206
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:12,706
(He doesn't know the title.)

1207
00:38:13,576 --> 00:38:17,375
(The composure of the one who knows the answer)

1208
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:18,745
- Choi Baek-core.
- Choi Baek-core?

1209
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:20,646
"A Story of Autumn Night" by Jannabi.

1210
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:22,616
Wrong.

1211
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:24,146
- Jong Cho Joon.
- Yes?

1212
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:25,716
"A Thought on Autumn Nights."

1213
00:38:26,546 --> 00:38:28,116
(Startled)

1214
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:29,316
- Almost...
- Say it one more time.

1215
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:30,556
"A Thought..."

1216
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,855
Say it well.

1217
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:34,296
- "A Thought on Autumn Nights?"
- "Thought on Autumn Nights."

1218
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,856
- "Thought on Autumn Nights?"
- "Thought on Autumn Nights."

1219
00:38:36,996 --> 00:38:38,025
Let me...

1220
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:39,525
- Wrong.
- Choi Baek-core.

1221
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:40,535
- Choi Baek-core?
- By Jannabi.

1222
00:38:40,536 --> 00:38:42,336
"A Thought on an Autumn Night."

1223
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:44,735
That's correct.

1224
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,575
I heard that it was "A Thought on an Autumn Night."

1225
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:48,976
(No way.)

1226
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:51,646
- Correct.
- Yes, that's right.

1227
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:55,916
(When you get it wrong, you get shot.)

1228
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:57,945
("A Thought on an Autumn Night" by Jannabi)

1229
00:38:57,946 --> 00:38:59,116
I love this song.

1230
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:03,786
(A song that you can't miss in autumn)

1231
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:11,226
(It's sure to resonate 1,200 percent with anyone feeling the fall vibes.)

1232
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:13,225
This is difficult.

1233
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,696
It's so difficult.

1234
00:39:15,196 --> 00:39:16,905
- All right.
- They're so much better than us.

1235
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:18,265
(2 members of Team Choi Baek-core succeeded already.)

1236
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:20,676
- We'll finish it fast.
- Shall we do the 2020s again?

1237
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,805
- No, you can't pick the same year.
- You can't repeat the year.

1238
00:39:22,806 --> 00:39:24,782
- You can't pick the same.
- I'll go with the 2010s.

1239
00:39:24,806 --> 00:39:27,076
- The 2010s?
- You're the only hope for us.

1240
00:39:27,376 --> 00:39:29,216
Music, please.

1241
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:33,186
This is so easy.

1242
00:39:33,286 --> 00:39:35,586
- Jong Cho Joon.
- He's got it.

1243
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:37,955
- "Wild Flower" by Park Hyo Shin.
- Right.

1244
00:39:37,956 --> 00:39:39,125
That's not it.

1245
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,555
No, that's wrong.

1246
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:42,525
- It's not "Wild Flower" at all.
- It's not it.

1247
00:39:42,526 --> 00:39:44,665
- Jong Cho Joon?
- How is it "Wild Flower?"

1248
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:46,295
- Wrong.
- I could be wrong.

1249
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:47,296
Is it such a big deal?

1250
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:50,335
- I could be wrong.
- Come on, Sae Ho.

1251
00:39:50,336 --> 00:39:51,405
(Let's listen to it slowly.)

1252
00:39:51,406 --> 00:39:52,606
- Isn't that it?
- No.

1253
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:55,405
It's definitely not it.

1254
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:57,276
- It has a similar vibe.
- No.

1255
00:39:57,476 --> 00:39:59,205
It's a great song. What is it called?

1256
00:39:59,206 --> 00:40:00,526
(DinDin gets a chance to answer.)

1257
00:40:00,846 --> 00:40:03,316
- Jong Cho Joon.
- He's got it.

1258
00:40:03,476 --> 00:40:04,815
(Joon seems to have figured out the answer.)

1259
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:05,915
You'll know when you hear the first line.

1260
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:07,055
Thoughtful Din, hurry.

1261
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:09,416
(He concentrates again and listens.)

1262
00:40:09,516 --> 00:40:10,626
That's enough.

1263
00:40:11,356 --> 00:40:12,456
That's enough.

1264
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:14,256
- He's got it.
- What is it?

1265
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,595
Now that it's stopped...

1266
00:40:16,596 --> 00:40:17,795
- Aren't we done listening?
- Now that it's stopped,

1267
00:40:17,796 --> 00:40:18,826
answer it.

1268
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:20,465
It's time for you to answer.

1269
00:40:20,466 --> 00:40:22,142
- You don't know the answer?
- How could you not know?

1270
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,495
DinDin, it's very easy.

1271
00:40:23,496 --> 00:40:24,805
Goodness.

1272
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:27,276
- It's very easy.
- Do the countdown, or I'll answer.

1273
00:40:27,336 --> 00:40:30,545
- Three, two...
- It's an easy one.

1274
00:40:30,546 --> 00:40:31,605
We lost this one.

1275
00:40:31,606 --> 00:40:32,606
- One.
- No.

1276
00:40:32,607 --> 00:40:34,015
- We lost it.
- Forget it.

1277
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:35,016
- I have no idea.
- Wrong.

1278
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:36,346
- Jong Cho Joon.
- Who is it?

1279
00:40:36,646 --> 00:40:37,746
(The wind is blowing...)

1280
00:40:38,086 --> 00:40:40,616
- Jong Cho Joon.
- Choi Baek-core.

1281
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:41,916
- Should I go?
- Yes.

1282
00:40:43,216 --> 00:40:45,185
(Team Jong Cho Joon got the chance by a narrow margin.)

1283
00:40:45,186 --> 00:40:48,325
- Jong Cho Joon.
- Jong Cho Joon.

1284
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:49,926
- You know it, right?
- I do.

1285
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:52,225
- "Memory of the Wind" by Naul.
- That's correct.

1286
00:40:52,226 --> 00:40:54,296
- Correct.
- Okay.

1287
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:56,895
(You have to sing it if you're a man.)

1288
00:40:56,896 --> 00:40:58,106
Is this it?

1289
00:41:01,036 --> 00:41:02,235
Here's DinDin's part.

1290
00:41:02,236 --> 00:41:06,445
(The eternal promises)

1291
00:41:06,446 --> 00:41:09,416
(A blood vessel pops out in his forehead.)

1292
00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:13,215
(Feeling the autumn with his whole body)

1293
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:18,385
(Feeling the high note with his whole body)

1294
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:19,426
It's too high.

1295
00:41:21,156 --> 00:41:23,426
(About to ascend to above)

1296
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,635
(It turns out that he's lip-syncing.)

1297
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:30,782
- I also thought the same as you.
- "Memory of the Wind..."

1298
00:41:30,806 --> 00:41:33,306
Joon, please pick the year.

1299
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:37,345
I'll pick the 1990s.

1300
00:41:37,346 --> 00:41:39,575
You know why? He knows many songs from the 1980s.

1301
00:41:39,576 --> 00:41:41,316
It's okay. I know some from the 1990s.

1302
00:41:41,616 --> 00:41:43,516
The result is unpredictable.

1303
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:49,356
- DinDin. I mean, Choi Baek-core.
- Jong Cho Joon.

1304
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,225
Jong Cho Joon.

1305
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:52,825
- Jong Cho Joon?
- He doesn't know.

1306
00:41:52,826 --> 00:41:54,125
- He doesn't know the answer.
- You have five seconds.

1307
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:56,795
- Five, four, three, - You don't know this one?

1308
00:41:56,796 --> 00:41:58,466
- two, one.
- Jong Cho Joon.

1309
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:00,765
- It's by Exhibition.
- Wrong.

1310
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,165
- "Etude of Memories" by Exhibition.
- Wrong.

1311
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,595
- That's right.
- He took too long.

1312
00:42:03,596 --> 00:42:04,905
No, this is fine.

1313
00:42:04,906 --> 00:42:06,905
- Let's count this one.
- That was thoughtless.

1314
00:42:06,906 --> 00:42:08,136
Wait.

1315
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:10,275
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

1316
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:11,556
- Kingking.
- What's the matter?

1317
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:17,386
(The thoughtful celebrity's bawling made him fall down.)

1318
00:42:18,116 --> 00:42:19,285
Kingking.

1319
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,315
- What's wrong?
- He must be crazy.

1320
00:42:20,316 --> 00:42:21,316
(He only takes care of Kingking.)

1321
00:42:21,317 --> 00:42:22,892
You have a hole in the pants. What's wrong?

1322
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,386
- What's wrong?
- What is he doing?

1323
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,655
- Jong Cho Joon is correct.
- Okay.

1324
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:28,825
I thought...

1325
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:34,036
("Etude of Memories" by Exhibition)

1326
00:42:34,436 --> 00:42:41,336
(An autumn hit song exploding with the 1990s vibe)

1327
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:49,416
(They travel back to the 1990s.)

1328
00:42:50,046 --> 00:42:52,746
(Featuring the boat horn sounds)

1329
00:42:54,556 --> 00:43:00,625
(It's a reminiscence, not a high note.)

1330
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:03,326
Only DinDin and Sae Ho remain.

1331
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:05,965
- You have to answer immediately.
- I can do it. It's okay.

1332
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:08,065
- Can you do it?
- I'll give it a try.

1333
00:43:08,066 --> 00:43:09,265
- Are you confident?
- I'll give it a try.

1334
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:11,736
- If you get it wrong, I'll shoot.
- Go ahead and shoot.

1335
00:43:12,736 --> 00:43:16,035
(Will Sae Ho be able to turn the tables?)

1336
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:18,845
I'll pick the 1980s. Give us a song from the 1980s.

1337
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,875
All right.

1338
00:43:19,876 --> 00:43:20,975
(The last question of Round 1, the 1980s)

1339
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:22,046
Listen carefully.

1340
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:23,802
I pick the 1980s.

1341
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:24,904
Ready.

1342
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:26,033
(The final question of Round 1: The 1980s)

1343
00:43:26,034 --> 00:43:27,204
Let's hear it.

1344
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:36,144
- Even I know this song.
- Hey, you...

1345
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:37,920
- Lim Cheol, are you serious?
- I know the answer.

1346
00:43:37,944 --> 00:43:40,453
- Team Jong Cho Joon!
- This is so easy.

1347
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:42,423
- Go ahead, Team Jong Cho Joon.
- I know the answer

1348
00:43:42,424 --> 00:43:45,454
- "To Lady" by Byun Jin Sub!
- All right!

1349
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:47,524
- Correct!
- We turned the table around.

1350
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:50,364
- We turned the table around.
- Although I want to know

1351
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:52,123
All right! We Won!

1352
00:43:52,124 --> 00:43:53,884
(He's not equipped with knowledge of music.)

1353
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:57,334
(We're so excited.)

1354
00:43:58,004 --> 00:44:00,234
(I won't watch that.)

1355
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:03,244
(Looking up and down nervously)

1356
00:44:04,104 --> 00:44:10,844
(Team Jong Cho Joon won Round 1!)

1357
00:44:12,014 --> 00:44:16,054
(Bitter)

1358
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,023
(Sae Ho, we praise you for getting the right answer quickly.)

1359
00:44:18,024 --> 00:44:20,123
- You did a great job.
- Thank you.

1360
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,523
That was so easy for you.

1361
00:44:21,524 --> 00:44:23,363
- Gosh, seriously.
- As a result,

1362
00:44:23,364 --> 00:44:25,594
Team Jong Cho Joon won the first round.

1363
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:27,334
- Okay.
- We turned the table around.

1364
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:29,633
- It's okay. Let's keep trying.
- Right.

1365
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:31,010
- Let's keep trying.
- What has gotten into you?

1366
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:32,873
- Let's keep trying.
- You're cheering us up?

1367
00:44:32,874 --> 00:44:33,874
(I'm surprised that he's boosting the morale of the team.)

1368
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:35,503
- Let's keep trying.
- I can't believe this.

1369
00:44:35,504 --> 00:44:37,043
- I was so surprised...
- I know, right?

1370
00:44:37,044 --> 00:44:39,244
That he didn't say the answer while knowing the answer.

1371
00:44:40,474 --> 00:44:43,044
If we win the next two rounds, it'll make the show more fun.

1372
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:44,460
- You're right.
- I'm impressed.

1373
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:46,453
- You planned to create a twist.
- Kingking, applaud.

1374
00:44:46,454 --> 00:44:48,090
(The sensible celebrity knows a lot how showbiz works.)

1375
00:44:48,114 --> 00:44:50,223
Since you won, will you give the other team a chance?

1376
00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:51,523
- What do you mean?
- A chance to choose the decade.

1377
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:52,693
- I'll ask Kingking.
- Okay.

1378
00:44:52,694 --> 00:44:54,134
Should we give them a chance or not?

1379
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:56,694
Kingking says no.

1380
00:44:58,194 --> 00:44:59,433
Kingking said no.

1381
00:44:59,434 --> 00:45:02,434
Then should we go first, Kingking?

1382
00:45:02,464 --> 00:45:03,904
Kingking says we should go first.

1383
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:06,473
Let's go with the 1980s again.

1384
00:45:06,474 --> 00:45:07,474
- The 1980s, it is.
- Yes.

1385
00:45:07,475 --> 00:45:09,573
- It had the most sentimental songs.
- We'll start a new round.

1386
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:10,643
We'll start a new round.

1387
00:45:10,644 --> 00:45:13,124
- Okay. We have Se Yoon anyway.
- We have Se Yoon on our team.

1388
00:45:13,414 --> 00:45:14,414
Ready.

1389
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:17,944
What?

1390
00:45:18,314 --> 00:45:19,713
(Flinching)

1391
00:45:19,714 --> 00:45:20,953
- What?
- Team Choi Baek-core!

1392
00:45:20,954 --> 00:45:22,154
Team Choi Baek-core, go ahead.

1393
00:45:22,884 --> 00:45:24,483
- I have no idea.
- Isn't this a foreign song?

1394
00:45:24,484 --> 00:45:25,523
- It's a song by Cho Yong Pil.
- Two.

1395
00:45:25,524 --> 00:45:26,623
Really?

1396
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:27,853
- One.
- "Red Dragonfly."

1397
00:45:27,854 --> 00:45:28,953
("Red Dragonfly" by Cho Yong Pil)

1398
00:45:28,954 --> 00:45:29,963
- Really?
- I think it's the correct answer.

1399
00:45:29,964 --> 00:45:31,164
I can't find it

1400
00:45:31,464 --> 00:45:32,733
- Correct!
- Okay!

1401
00:45:32,734 --> 00:45:34,093
You're really amazing.

1402
00:45:34,094 --> 00:45:35,733
(Team Choi Baek-core scored 1st in Round 2.)

1403
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,763
- Wasn't that amazing?
- How did he know?

1404
00:45:37,764 --> 00:45:41,504
(Imitating Cho Yong Pil)

1405
00:45:41,934 --> 00:45:46,174
(The song made every Korean sing along in the 1980s.)

1406
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:49,944
("Red Dragonfly," the national song made by the legend)

1407
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:54,614
(Let us sing the song together.)

1408
00:45:55,554 --> 00:45:58,753
(The reactions of the two teams are very different.)

1409
00:45:58,754 --> 00:45:59,953
How did you know?

1410
00:45:59,954 --> 00:46:01,193
I was afraid I might be wrong

1411
00:46:01,194 --> 00:46:02,194
(Se Yoon, the genius of music quiz)

1412
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:03,194
- That was incredible.
- Okay. I scored a point.

1413
00:46:03,195 --> 00:46:04,493
(Only Se Yoon got the right answer so far in Round 2.)

1414
00:46:04,494 --> 00:46:05,593
That was incredible.

1415
00:46:05,594 --> 00:46:07,394
Se Yoon, that was really amazing.

1416
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:08,693
I was unsure to the end.

1417
00:46:08,694 --> 00:46:10,563
- I pick the 2020s.
- The 2020s.

1418
00:46:10,564 --> 00:46:11,803
It was going well earlier on.

1419
00:46:11,804 --> 00:46:13,473
- Okay.
- Let's trust DinDin again.

1420
00:46:13,474 --> 00:46:15,103
If it's a song from the 2020s,

1421
00:46:15,104 --> 00:46:16,543
it could be a song by ChoNam Zone.

1422
00:46:16,544 --> 00:46:18,373
- No, they won't play your song.
- Why?

1423
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:19,813
- You seem to look down on us.
- No, that's not the case.

1424
00:46:19,814 --> 00:46:21,773
- I think you're looking down on us.
- That's not the case.

1425
00:46:21,774 --> 00:46:23,713
I think ChoNam Zone's songs are good for all four seasons.

1426
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,954
(ChoNam Zone's songs are good for all four seasons.)

1427
00:46:27,314 --> 00:46:29,483
You're really eloquent.

1428
00:46:29,484 --> 00:46:30,653
- It's for all seasons.
- I'm impressed.

1429
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,493
- He's so eloquent.
- It's for all seasons.

1430
00:46:32,494 --> 00:46:33,670
He's really eloquent. Impressive.

1431
00:46:33,694 --> 00:46:35,864
I listen to ChoNam Zone's songs in summer as well.

1432
00:46:36,424 --> 00:46:38,304
He scares me. He feels like a different person.

1433
00:46:38,864 --> 00:46:40,963
- Let's move on.
- That was so funny.

1434
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,303
- Okay. Music...
- Which decade?

1435
00:46:43,304 --> 00:46:44,803
- The 2020s. Remember it.
- The 2020s?

1436
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:46,804
- Music, please.
- Team Choi Baek-core. How funny.

1437
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:48,673
(To say goodbye...)

1438
00:46:48,674 --> 00:46:50,173
- Team Choi Baek-core.
- Team Jong Cho Joon.

1439
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,273
- Team Jong Cho Joon.
- Team Choi Baek-core, go ahead.

1440
00:46:51,274 --> 00:46:53,143
"Let's Say Goodbye" by Park Jae Jung.

1441
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,213
("Let's Say Goodbye" by Park Jae Jung)

1442
00:46:54,214 --> 00:46:55,543
- Okay.
- Correct.

1443
00:46:55,544 --> 00:46:56,843
- Okay.
- I knew the answer too.

1444
00:46:56,844 --> 00:46:59,883
("Let's Say Goodbye" by Park Jae Jung)

1445
00:46:59,884 --> 00:47:02,924
(Released on April 20, 2023)

1446
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:10,164
(The song that all men sing after a breakup)

1447
00:47:10,224 --> 00:47:12,904
- It's going the same way as before.
- Which decade should we pick?

1448
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:14,824
Let's turn the table around again.

1449
00:47:15,364 --> 00:47:17,303
- Which decade should we pick?
- The 2010s.

1450
00:47:17,304 --> 00:47:18,964
- The 2010s. Okay.
- Good. That's better.

1451
00:47:20,774 --> 00:47:21,833
- Team Choi Baek-core.
- Good.

1452
00:47:21,834 --> 00:47:23,503
- Team Choi Baek-core.
- He knows the answer.

1453
00:47:23,504 --> 00:47:24,603
(DinDin got the chance to answer by a hair's breadth.)

1454
00:47:24,604 --> 00:47:25,703
- You know it, right? Yes.
- It's Yoon Jong Shin's...

1455
00:47:25,704 --> 00:47:27,113
- That's right.
- "Like It."

1456
00:47:27,114 --> 00:47:29,114
- Let's go!
- He got that right.

1457
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:30,454
I'm sorry for getting it right.

1458
00:47:30,944 --> 00:47:31,944
- Correct!
- Gosh, you brat.

1459
00:47:31,945 --> 00:47:34,783
("Like It" by Yoon Jong Shin, released on June 22, 2017)

1460
00:47:34,784 --> 00:47:35,883
I knew the answer.

1461
00:47:35,884 --> 00:47:38,754
(They lost Round 2 without even getting a chance to answer.)

1462
00:47:40,154 --> 00:47:44,094
(But I'm still going to sing.)

1463
00:47:45,164 --> 00:47:46,394
- DinDin.
- Yes?

1464
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:49,664
Feel the pain

1465
00:47:50,164 --> 00:47:51,533
You heal yourself with music even when you're in pain.

1466
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:52,704
(Sudden attack)

1467
00:47:53,674 --> 00:47:55,373
(I'm happy even though I'm in pain.)

1468
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:56,644
- As a result...
- Okay.

1469
00:47:56,744 --> 00:47:57,744
The score is 1 to 1.

1470
00:47:57,745 --> 00:47:59,743
- Team Choi Baek-core won one round.
- Okay.

1471
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:00,744
(Team Choi Baek-core: 1, Team Jong Cho Joon: 1)

1472
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:02,543
This is a complete defeat. This is not good.

1473
00:48:02,544 --> 00:48:04,383
The score is 1 to 1.

1474
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:06,883
The team to win the final round wins.

1475
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,930
- Goodness, the sunlight is...
- How about the 2020s?

1476
00:48:08,954 --> 00:48:10,353
We'll go with the 2020s.

1477
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:11,424
(Standing up slowly)

1478
00:48:13,194 --> 00:48:14,524
(So sweet)

1479
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:16,724
(His manner even surprised the staff members too.)

1480
00:48:16,764 --> 00:48:18,223
- Why...
- Who are you, really?

1481
00:48:18,224 --> 00:48:19,663
Why did you switch seats with me?

1482
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:20,664
Sorry?

1483
00:48:20,694 --> 00:48:21,733
You even lent me your sunglasses.

1484
00:48:21,734 --> 00:48:22,803
I saw that you were bothered by the sunlight.

1485
00:48:22,804 --> 00:48:24,644
(He even lent Se Yoon his sunglasses already.)

1486
00:48:24,734 --> 00:48:27,404
(He felt warmth from DinDin for the first time and fainted.)

1487
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,384
- We'll go with the 2020s.
- Will you go first?

1488
00:48:29,904 --> 00:48:30,944
The 2020s.

1489
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:33,244
"Play a song from the 2020s."

1490
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,774
- He looks just like Raccoon.
- "The 2020s."

1491
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:37,814
Detective Raccoon.

1492
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:39,855
"I can guess a song after hearing only half of it."

1493
00:48:40,654 --> 00:48:41,714
"The 2020s."

1494
00:48:42,154 --> 00:48:43,324
He's so good at it.

1495
00:48:43,984 --> 00:48:45,953
- Ready. Music...
- We should start right away.

1496
00:48:45,954 --> 00:48:46,954
(The 1st question of Round 3: The 2020s)

1497
00:48:46,955 --> 00:48:48,315
- It's difficult.
- Music, please.

1498
00:48:51,594 --> 00:48:52,594
- What song is this?
- I've never heard this song before.

1499
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:53,864
I've never heard this before.

1500
00:48:54,794 --> 00:48:56,963
- Team Choi Baek-core.
- Go ahead.

1501
00:48:56,964 --> 00:48:58,284
I've never heard this in my life.

1502
00:48:58,734 --> 00:49:00,404
- Three.
- It's a song by Hwasa.

1503
00:49:00,934 --> 00:49:02,304
"Good Goodbye."

1504
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:04,803
It's her new song that she released recently.

1505
00:49:04,804 --> 00:49:05,903
- Oh, gosh. I know the song.
- The song...

1506
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:07,013
- was released this week?
- Correct.

1507
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:09,314
(DinDin's answer is correct.)

1508
00:49:09,744 --> 00:49:12,484
("Good Goodbye" by Hwasa, released on October 15, 2025)

1509
00:49:12,654 --> 00:49:13,814
It's her new song.

1510
00:49:16,284 --> 00:49:18,283
(I knew the answer too.)

1511
00:49:18,284 --> 00:49:20,030
- Oh, my. I'm surprised.
- On my radio show,

1512
00:49:20,054 --> 00:49:21,993
- It's her new song?
- I played this song this week.

1513
00:49:21,994 --> 00:49:23,093
It was a song I recommended.

1514
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,540
He knows the latest songs. He's a radio DJ for a reason.

1515
00:49:24,564 --> 00:49:27,093
I starred on the same show as Hwasa not long ago.

1516
00:49:27,094 --> 00:49:28,493
(Resentful glare)

1517
00:49:28,494 --> 00:49:30,763
I keep enjoying listening to music instead of getting the right answer.

1518
00:49:30,764 --> 00:49:31,834
This is driving me nuts.

1519
00:49:32,564 --> 00:49:34,433
Would it be better to pick the 1980s and then the 2020s?

1520
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:35,503
(Shall we let Se Yoon succeed first?)

1521
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:37,044
Let's pick the 1980s or the 1990s.

1522
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:38,504
The 1980s.

1523
00:49:38,704 --> 00:49:39,844
- The 1980s?
- Right.

1524
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:43,264
He can guess any song from the 1980s only by listening to the intro.

1525
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,074
Let's do well this time, Jong Min.

1526
00:49:45,144 --> 00:49:47,153
If we lose this round, we'll lose the game.

1527
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:48,184
Exactly.

1528
00:49:48,854 --> 00:49:51,354
But I just can't guess it. This is driving me crazy.

1529
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:56,823
- Even I know this song.
- Is it from the 1980s?

1530
00:49:56,824 --> 00:49:58,094
What song is it?

1531
00:49:58,464 --> 00:49:59,794
- Is it from the 1980s?
- Yes.

1532
00:50:00,134 --> 00:50:01,134
(I said I knew many songs from the 1980s, but I take it back.)

1533
00:50:01,135 --> 00:50:03,233
I know this song. What is it?

1534
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,934
(He's not so sure.)

1535
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:10,003
(The older member on this team doesn't seem to have a clue either.)

1536
00:50:10,004 --> 00:50:11,450
- Team Choi Baek-core.
- Team Jong Cho Joon.

1537
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:12,474
(Team Choi Baek-core!)

1538
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:14,813
- Se Yoon shouted first.
- Team Choi Baek-core, go ahead.

1539
00:50:14,814 --> 00:50:16,113
- It's a song by Yoo Jae Ha.
- Yes, that's correct.

1540
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:17,943
("Because I Love You" by Yoo Jae Ha)

1541
00:50:17,944 --> 00:50:19,283
- Right. That's the song.
- What a shame.

1542
00:50:19,284 --> 00:50:20,413
- I guess it's correct. Okay.
- Yes, it's correct.

1543
00:50:20,414 --> 00:50:21,454
- Correct.
- Oh, yes.

1544
00:50:23,884 --> 00:50:26,484
("Because I Love You" by Yoo Jae Ha, released on August 20, 1987)

1545
00:50:29,564 --> 00:50:31,494
I hope you will come back in autumn.

1546
00:50:33,234 --> 00:50:36,833
(The melody even makes a biker feel sentimental.)

1547
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:39,034
We're not singing it slowly. It's originally this slow.

1548
00:50:40,634 --> 00:50:43,844
(The opposite vibes of the two teams)

1549
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:45,643
We can turn the table around.

1550
00:50:45,644 --> 00:50:46,674
(Cheer up already.)

1551
00:50:48,444 --> 00:50:50,313
(The gun is loaded with bullets of anger.)

1552
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:54,054
The decade for the final question that my team picked is...

1553
00:50:54,554 --> 00:50:55,683
the 2020s.

1554
00:50:55,684 --> 00:50:57,953
- If we pick another decade, - The decade guarantees a win.

1555
00:50:57,954 --> 00:50:59,493
- Seon Ho can't win.
- That's right.

1556
00:50:59,494 --> 00:51:00,853
- Seon Ho is the only one left, yes?
- Yes.

1557
00:51:00,854 --> 00:51:02,223
We just have to score a point this time...

1558
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:03,923
- and then pick the 1980s.
- Then it'll be game over.

1559
00:51:03,924 --> 00:51:05,324
- And then...
- It'll be game over.

1560
00:51:05,664 --> 00:51:06,933
I'm so nervous.

1561
00:51:06,934 --> 00:51:08,264
(Nervous)

1562
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:10,764
(Let's make sure to score a point this time.)

1563
00:51:12,534 --> 00:51:13,733
(Disturbing)

1564
00:51:13,734 --> 00:51:15,373
Seon Ho! I mean, Team Choi Baek-core.

1565
00:51:15,374 --> 00:51:16,503
- Okay!
- It's over.

1566
00:51:16,504 --> 00:51:18,220
- This is so easy.
- You know the answer, don't you?

1567
00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:20,213
- Gosh. I know this song.
- "Love Always Run Away..."

1568
00:51:20,214 --> 00:51:21,413
by Lim Young Woong.

1569
00:51:21,414 --> 00:51:23,143
- It's originally by Lee Moon Sae.
- How did you know?

1570
00:51:23,144 --> 00:51:24,283
- That's right.
- It's originally by Lee Moon Sae.

1571
00:51:24,284 --> 00:51:25,284
Oh, really?

1572
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:26,853
("Love Always Run Away" by Lim Young Woong)

1573
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:28,414
- Correct.
- I know this song.

1574
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:31,724
(Team Choi Baek-core wins the Autumn Music Quiz.)

1575
00:51:33,294 --> 00:51:36,394
(Autumn songs are all about sentiment.)

1576
00:51:37,064 --> 00:51:38,393
("Love Always Run Away," released on October 11, 2021)

1577
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:39,494
I know this song. Gosh.

1578
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:41,663
(The mellow voice of the master of sentiment Lim Young Woong)

1579
00:51:41,664 --> 00:51:42,840
Why can't I remember songs more quickly?

1580
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:44,263
Let me give you a piece of information.

1581
00:51:44,264 --> 00:51:46,373
- You have more information?
- Yes. Recently,

1582
00:51:46,374 --> 00:51:47,803
the Korea Pop Culture Association...

1583
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,333
selected the most influential artists...

1584
00:51:49,334 --> 00:51:50,943
- in the history of music industry.
- Was he chosen too?

1585
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:52,380
Lim Young Woong is one of the selected artists.

1586
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:54,513
- What about you, DinDin?
- Well, I...

1587
00:51:54,514 --> 00:51:56,194
- What a shame.
- I just checked the list.

1588
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,453
- He's 1 of those 40 artists?
- I was jealous.

1589
00:51:59,454 --> 00:52:00,454
(He couldn't see his name on the list.)

1590
00:52:00,455 --> 00:52:02,213
- Nice!
- We won a complete victory.

1591
00:52:02,214 --> 00:52:04,023
If I was the one who was left, I wouldn't have scored.

1592
00:52:04,024 --> 00:52:05,083
Right. It was a difficult one.

1593
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:06,644
- The order was nice.
- How about we...

1594
00:52:06,694 --> 00:52:08,353
How about the winning team gets one piece?

1595
00:52:08,354 --> 00:52:09,794
- Pardon?
- One piece of the puzzle.

1596
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:10,963
One piece from each team?

1597
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:12,663
- Let's bet on giving a piece.
- The losing team gives a piece?

1598
00:52:12,664 --> 00:52:14,063
- Let's do that.
- Do you agree with the rules?

1599
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,233
- Okay.
- Each team has six pieces.

1600
00:52:15,234 --> 00:52:17,064
- The score will be 5 to 7.
- That's right.

1601
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:18,933
- How about we bet two pieces?
- Two pieces?

1602
00:52:18,934 --> 00:52:19,934
- Two pieces.
- Two pieces?

1603
00:52:19,935 --> 00:52:21,473
- You won't blame me?
- No, I won't.

1604
00:52:21,474 --> 00:52:22,533
Of course, we won't blame you.

1605
00:52:22,534 --> 00:52:24,073
- The winner takes two pieces.
- Okay.

1606
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,573
- We could win again.
- Should we say our team name?

1607
00:52:25,574 --> 00:52:26,673
- Yes.
- Team Choi Baek-core.

1608
00:52:26,674 --> 00:52:27,744
Ready.

1609
00:52:28,614 --> 00:52:29,614
Music, please.

1610
00:52:30,444 --> 00:52:31,843
- Team Choi Baek-core.
- Yes, that's the answer.

1611
00:52:31,844 --> 00:52:32,884
What is it?

1612
00:52:33,954 --> 00:52:35,453
- What was it?
- I think I know this one...

1613
00:52:35,454 --> 00:52:37,454
- Three...
- "Sad Promise" by Kim Jung Min.

1614
00:52:37,784 --> 00:52:38,954
No, that's not correct.

1615
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:41,223
(Will they get the answer this time again?)

1616
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,344
- No, it's incorrect.
- I don't think that's the one.

1617
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:44,994
- Please...
- That is correct.

1618
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,764
(Quiz Ace of Autumn got it again.)

1619
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:52,764
(He's winning all the side games as well.)

1620
00:52:53,574 --> 00:52:58,344
("Sad Promise" by Kim Jung Min, released on November 1, 1995)

1621
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:02,613
(Perfectly imitating the facial expression too)

1622
00:53:02,614 --> 00:53:03,614
That was amazing.

1623
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,575
- How did you know?
- Se Yoon is so good at this.

1624
00:53:05,744 --> 00:53:06,953
- We can't beat him.
- This isn't happening...

1625
00:53:06,954 --> 00:53:09,353
- Do you want to try again?
- Stop it now.

1626
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:10,624
Stop it already.

1627
00:53:11,654 --> 00:53:13,723
- One more round on the 2000s?
- No, we're not playing.

1628
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:15,894
- How about the 2000s?
- Let's go for the 2000s.

1629
00:53:16,054 --> 00:53:18,024
It would have been nice if we could bet on one.

1630
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:19,633
- All right.
- How about one?

1631
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:21,193
No, we won't play.

1632
00:53:21,194 --> 00:53:22,354
Se Yoon can stay out of this.

1633
00:53:22,794 --> 00:53:24,763
Why don't you make it 1-on-1 matches?

1634
00:53:24,764 --> 00:53:26,874
- Okay.
- Who's playing from your team?

1635
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,503
No, I won't play. Let's not play!

1636
00:53:28,504 --> 00:53:29,943
- Just play.
- How about Joon?

1637
00:53:29,944 --> 00:53:31,603
- Joon didn't say a word.
- He doesn't know any songs.

1638
00:53:31,604 --> 00:53:32,643
- You should play.
- But you...

1639
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:34,844
People would think you did something wrong.

1640
00:53:35,214 --> 00:53:37,014
You should say something at least.

1641
00:53:37,084 --> 00:53:38,243
How about Seon Ho versus Joon?

1642
00:53:38,244 --> 00:53:39,964
- What do you think?
- Seon Ho versus Joon.

1643
00:53:40,014 --> 00:53:42,353
Seon Ho wasn't even born in the 2000s.

1644
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:43,853
That's why we should play this.

1645
00:53:43,854 --> 00:53:45,124
What do you mean?

1646
00:53:45,324 --> 00:53:47,294
That's why we want to play this.

1647
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,863
You should have just asked for one.

1648
00:53:49,864 --> 00:53:51,123
Just give me one.

1649
00:53:51,124 --> 00:53:52,763
- I'll play against DinDin.
- Really?

1650
00:53:52,764 --> 00:53:54,134
You will? I don't know any songs.

1651
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,664
(Kingking, we are done.)

1652
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:57,963
Let's play now.

1653
00:53:57,964 --> 00:53:59,063
(Will Team Jong Cho Joon earn back one block?)

1654
00:53:59,064 --> 00:54:00,174
Music,

1655
00:54:00,934 --> 00:54:02,804
- They can't play this.
- please.

1656
00:54:04,644 --> 00:54:06,474
Team Jong Cho Joon!

1657
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:08,243
Joon! He got this.

1658
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:10,144
- "All For You" by Cool.
- Yes!

1659
00:54:10,284 --> 00:54:12,814
- This must be correct.
- It's a different version.

1660
00:54:12,954 --> 00:54:14,584
(Will we get the answer this time?)

1661
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,224
(DinDin's eyes shaking behind his sunglasses)

1662
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:18,823
- It's a different version.
- Joon, that is correct.

1663
00:54:18,824 --> 00:54:20,194
(Joon got the answer.)

1664
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:23,864
("All For You" by Cool)

1665
00:54:24,424 --> 00:54:26,824
(They earned back one block by beating Team Choi Baek-core.)

1666
00:54:27,134 --> 00:54:29,264
Even I knew this song.

1667
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:32,304
(Feeling frustrated)

1668
00:54:32,664 --> 00:54:36,404
(The energy between the two teams flipped in an instant.)

1669
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,043
(The current number of slots)

1670
00:54:39,044 --> 00:54:40,643
(Team Choi Baek-core: 7, Team Jong Cho Joon: 5)

1671
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,844
We should have had that song if it were in the 2010s.

1672
00:54:43,384 --> 00:54:45,744
"How Can I Love The Heartbreak, You're The One I Love."

1673
00:54:45,944 --> 00:54:47,313
Yes, we had that on the list.

1674
00:54:47,314 --> 00:54:48,953
- I would have known that song.
- Me too.

1675
00:54:48,954 --> 00:54:51,183
This is always on the radio song list...

1676
00:54:51,184 --> 00:54:53,023
during this time of the year.

1677
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:54,700
(We must listen to this song when it's autumn.)

1678
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:59,564
(Feeling melancholy)

1679
00:55:00,534 --> 00:55:06,004
(Getting sentimental)

1680
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:07,974
Gosh, this is nice.

1681
00:55:08,334 --> 00:55:09,403
Right, the view is amazing.

1682
00:55:09,404 --> 00:55:10,803
Look at the color of the water.

1683
00:55:10,804 --> 00:55:13,113
The color of the sky is reflected on the surface.

1684
00:55:13,114 --> 00:55:14,144
The color is so pretty.

1685
00:55:15,014 --> 00:55:16,414
It's just like painted by Bob Ross.

1686
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:21,554
(Autumn in Danyang, with its beautiful fall foliage)

1687
00:55:22,084 --> 00:55:24,654
(I love autumn.)

1688
00:55:25,524 --> 00:55:27,924
(While on a joyful ride...)

1689
00:55:28,494 --> 00:55:29,893
Spicy seafood stew...

1690
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:31,693
Can everyone here eat this...

1691
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:32,694
Everyone loves it.

1692
00:55:32,695 --> 00:55:35,033
- I can't have enough of it.
- Right, I agree.

1693
00:55:35,034 --> 00:55:39,904
(They're now at the upper reaches of the Namhan River.)

1694
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:42,733
Is it something like spicy rockfish stew?

1695
00:55:42,734 --> 00:55:44,944
- I love it so much.
- Me too.

1696
00:55:45,544 --> 00:55:46,544
What is this place?

1697
00:55:46,714 --> 00:55:49,543
- It must be delicious.
- I can smell it already.

1698
00:55:49,544 --> 00:55:51,083
- Rockfish.
- Rockfish.

1699
00:55:51,084 --> 00:55:52,144
What is this?

1700
00:55:52,444 --> 00:55:54,164
I can smell the spicy seafood stew already.

1701
00:55:55,184 --> 00:55:56,624
Isn't this rockfish?

1702
00:55:57,624 --> 00:56:00,953
Korean rockfish from the pristine upper reaches...

1703
00:56:00,954 --> 00:56:03,163
of the Namhan River.

1704
00:56:03,164 --> 00:56:06,223
It is considered a rare delicacy among freshwater fish.

1705
00:56:06,224 --> 00:56:07,363
(A rare delicacy with great flavors and nutrition)

1706
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,534
- As you expected, today's lunch...
- Okay.

1707
00:56:09,564 --> 00:56:12,463
It's called the King of Freshwater, Rockfish Special.

1708
00:56:12,464 --> 00:56:15,374
(Rockfish Special)

1709
00:56:15,934 --> 00:56:17,444
We can see it from here.

1710
00:56:18,104 --> 00:56:20,343
The texture is chewy and mild.

1711
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:22,843
It also has sweet and savory flavors.

1712
00:56:22,844 --> 00:56:24,683
- It's good in a stew.
- Right.

1713
00:56:24,684 --> 00:56:26,414
(Spicy rockfish stew)

1714
00:56:26,554 --> 00:56:28,453
You can also have it as it is.

1715
00:56:28,454 --> 00:56:30,253
People have it fresh in its raw forms.

1716
00:56:30,254 --> 00:56:32,334
(With its natural chewy texture and flavorful flesh)

1717
00:56:32,854 --> 00:56:35,724
(Rockfish sashimi)

1718
00:56:36,324 --> 00:56:38,093
(Flavors of Danyang, a table full of King of Freshwater)

1719
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:39,523
The owner of this restaurant...

1720
00:56:39,524 --> 00:56:41,734
caught this fish from there.

1721
00:56:42,134 --> 00:56:44,733
- He caught the fish and cooked it.
- Yes, he caught it.

1722
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,003
- Goodness.
- That's amazing.

1723
00:56:46,004 --> 00:56:48,604
It's not available every day. We have to try it.

1724
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:50,380
- It's not available every day.
- It must be fresh.

1725
00:56:50,404 --> 00:56:55,114
You'll bet a Rockfish Special and six slots on this mission.

1726
00:56:55,844 --> 00:56:58,043
This is a big game. We have to win this.

1727
00:56:58,044 --> 00:57:01,053
This mission is I'll Rockfish Shoot You.

1728
00:57:01,054 --> 00:57:02,153
- I'll Rockfish Shoot You.
- I'll Rockfish Shoot You.

1729
00:57:02,154 --> 00:57:03,324
There's the gunman.

1730
00:57:03,524 --> 00:57:04,983
Did you bring your gun?

1731
00:57:04,984 --> 00:57:05,984
No, I left it.

1732
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:08,553
The game is over.

1733
00:57:08,554 --> 00:57:09,823
(The cowboy is suffering from short-term memory loss.)

1734
00:57:09,824 --> 00:57:12,624
It's a 1-on-1 Russian roulette match.

1735
00:57:12,964 --> 00:57:16,563
You have to shoot the gun above the opponent's head.

1736
00:57:16,564 --> 00:57:18,863
Whoever bursts the balloon first wins.

1737
00:57:18,864 --> 00:57:20,403
The game will be played in a best-of-three format.

1738
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:22,933
It's a 1-on-1 match. You all get to participate once.

1739
00:57:22,934 --> 00:57:24,373
(It's all about luck now.)

1740
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,403
It's all about luck.

1741
00:57:25,404 --> 00:57:27,244
- Okay.
- But as if he knew this...

1742
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:30,413
He left his gun when we needed it to play.

1743
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:31,483
- That tells me something.
- It's foreshadowing.

1744
00:57:31,484 --> 00:57:33,190
- This tells me that he's losing.
- This is...

1745
00:57:33,214 --> 00:57:35,054
They're trying to beat us with their energy.

1746
00:57:35,254 --> 00:57:37,953
I'll play first since I got good energy.

1747
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,553
DinDin is the number one player of the show.

1748
00:57:40,554 --> 00:57:42,070
(Team Choi Baek-core's 1st player, DinDin)

1749
00:57:42,094 --> 00:57:43,764
Joon, you should go.

1750
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:45,494
Joon, give it a go.

1751
00:57:45,994 --> 00:57:48,363
This is all about energy. We got this.

1752
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,593
- DinDin.
- Let's play...

1753
00:57:49,594 --> 00:57:50,733
- DinDin is good at this.
- You can beat him, right?

1754
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:52,803
- Just grab the gun.
- Can you even grab it?

1755
00:57:52,804 --> 00:57:54,103
- I'm not good at grabbing it.
- You aren't?

1756
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:56,543
- He has never grabbed it before.
- Joon and I...

1757
00:57:56,544 --> 00:57:58,144
We had a fortuneteller read our signs.

1758
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:00,544
- Don't talk about it.
- I'm a tree.

1759
00:58:00,914 --> 00:58:03,144
Joon is a mountain that doesn't get swayed.

1760
00:58:03,544 --> 00:58:05,314
That's where I bloom my flowers.

1761
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:10,854
My flowers bloom in his mountain.

1762
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,883
That's a very good match.

1763
00:58:12,884 --> 00:58:14,253
It's not about being a good match.

1764
00:58:14,254 --> 00:58:16,053
I asked about the benefits I would get by being around DinDin.

1765
00:58:16,054 --> 00:58:17,093
There is none.

1766
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:20,034
- He doesn't get swayed.
- I just become his mountain.

1767
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:21,910
You give all your energy and nutrition to him.

1768
00:58:21,934 --> 00:58:23,863
- This is the first match.
- He's taking Joon's energy away.

1769
00:58:23,864 --> 00:58:24,933
Let's go, Joon.

1770
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:25,963
Take this.

1771
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:26,973
(They're ready.)

1772
00:58:26,974 --> 00:58:29,333
Play rock-paper-scissors. Whoever wins, shoots first.

1773
00:58:29,334 --> 00:58:30,750
(Deciding the order with rock-paper-scissors)

1774
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:32,943
It has confetti inside.

1775
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:34,224
(It's important to shoot first.)

1776
00:58:34,414 --> 00:58:36,683
He gave me a lot already.

1777
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:37,744
I'll play scissors.

1778
00:58:39,414 --> 00:58:40,914
Joon, don't trust him.

1779
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:43,954
Then I'll have to play rock.

1780
00:58:44,524 --> 00:58:47,323
- I'll be sure.
- Play scissors.

1781
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:49,193
- Yes.
- Joon, don't trust him.

1782
00:58:49,194 --> 00:58:50,894
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1783
00:58:58,634 --> 00:59:00,774
You would have lost if he played scissors.

1784
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,973
I'll play scissors this time for sure.

1785
00:59:02,974 --> 00:59:05,273
- I won't make it a tie.
- Then I'll just stay with this.

1786
00:59:05,274 --> 00:59:06,644
- Sure.
- I'll stay with this.

1787
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:08,414
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1788
00:59:08,974 --> 00:59:10,184
- Goodness.
- We got it.

1789
00:59:10,744 --> 00:59:13,014
He surely is the mountain.

1790
00:59:13,114 --> 00:59:14,554
How many times do I have to spin it?

1791
00:59:14,854 --> 00:59:16,653
- Only the winners spin it?
- Spin it twice.

1792
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:17,784
One...

1793
00:59:17,884 --> 00:59:18,884
(The roulette wheel has been spun.)

1794
00:59:18,885 --> 00:59:19,923
- Okay.
- What's this?

1795
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:21,370
- I spun it 2 times.
- You spun it 3 times.

1796
00:59:21,394 --> 00:59:22,853
- He spun it six times.
- Okay.

1797
00:59:22,854 --> 00:59:24,263
Why did you even ask?

1798
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:25,564
Can he shoot now?

1799
00:59:26,124 --> 00:59:27,193
- Yes.
- Start.

1800
00:59:27,194 --> 00:59:29,533
- DinDin wins if it bursts.
- Right.

1801
00:59:29,534 --> 00:59:30,534
That's right.

1802
00:59:31,104 --> 00:59:33,034
(It even makes the viewer flinch.)

1803
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:34,833
- My mountain!
- Burst.

1804
00:59:34,834 --> 00:59:37,504
(DinDin pulled the trigger.)

1805
00:59:37,704 --> 00:59:38,744
Burst!

1806
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,243
Burst!

1807
00:59:42,244 --> 00:59:43,413
(Pulling)

1808
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:44,483
All right, then.

1809
00:59:44,484 --> 00:59:45,484
(Joon passed.)

1810
00:59:45,485 --> 00:59:46,613
- Then...
- Pull it.

1811
00:59:46,614 --> 00:59:48,284
Pull the trigger to the end.

1812
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:50,154
- You have to pull it to the end.
- Pull.

1813
00:59:50,784 --> 00:59:51,824
To the end...

1814
00:59:52,154 --> 00:59:54,553
- I think it's done.
- You lose if it bursts now.

1815
00:59:54,554 --> 00:59:55,624
- He's right.
- Right.

1816
00:59:55,924 --> 01:00:00,434
(Even the watcher is getting more nervous.)

1817
01:00:02,664 --> 01:00:03,664
(Sighing)

1818
01:00:05,434 --> 01:00:08,004
I'm not your mountain anymore.

1819
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:10,604
(Pulling)

1820
01:00:10,944 --> 01:00:13,313
(The joy and sorrow clash once again.)

1821
01:00:13,314 --> 01:00:14,374
Okay.

1822
01:00:15,374 --> 01:00:16,614
Okay.

1823
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:20,514
- What was that?
- It just popped.

1824
01:00:22,654 --> 01:00:25,854
(It popped after some time.)

1825
01:00:25,924 --> 01:00:29,294
- So it popped!
- Okay!

1826
01:00:29,494 --> 01:00:30,593
Okay!

1827
01:00:30,594 --> 01:00:32,823
But it didn't burst right away.

1828
01:00:32,824 --> 01:00:35,193
Let's watch the video again. I'm objecting as a team.

1829
01:00:35,194 --> 01:00:37,334
- This is how it worked.
- I mean we had good energy.

1830
01:00:37,964 --> 01:00:39,933
Joon pressed it with his nail.

1831
01:00:39,934 --> 01:00:40,934
- Come on.
- Come on.

1832
01:00:41,034 --> 01:00:42,573
- Don't do that.
- I'm not that...

1833
01:00:42,574 --> 01:00:43,943
I'm not a cheater like that.

1834
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:45,943
(The tree is getting pathetic because of the lunch menu.)

1835
01:00:45,944 --> 01:00:47,043
Congratulations.

1836
01:00:47,044 --> 01:00:49,644
(Congratulations anyway!)

1837
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:50,914
Let's see...

1838
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,234
- So it's done if we lose again.
- The energy...

1839
01:00:53,654 --> 01:00:55,083
- We're done if we lose again.
- That's right.

1840
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,453
- Let's check today's fortune.
- Let's check.

1841
01:00:57,454 --> 01:00:58,684
Let me read today's fortune.

1842
01:00:59,084 --> 01:01:00,393
- Who should go first?
- It's here.

1843
01:01:00,394 --> 01:01:02,254
(Whoever has better luck will play next.)

1844
01:01:02,354 --> 01:01:04,493
- If Sae Ho wins this round...
- It's done.

1845
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,693
- It's done.
- Yes.

1846
01:01:05,694 --> 01:01:07,733
- I'm...
- Then they lose.

1847
01:01:07,734 --> 01:01:09,293
"You will have good results if you do your best."

1848
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:11,503
"You'll win a good position or get promoted..."

1849
01:01:11,504 --> 01:01:12,504
"thanks to that."

1850
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:13,973
- Se Yoon...
- I have to try my best.

1851
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:15,003
You should go.

1852
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,433
- You should go.
- Rock-paper-scissors?

1853
01:01:16,434 --> 01:01:18,243
Rock-paper-scissors. Did you see?

1854
01:01:18,244 --> 01:01:21,044
If you don't want to play this, we won't get to eat.

1855
01:01:21,414 --> 01:01:22,743
- Nice to see you here.
- Take your seat.

1856
01:01:22,744 --> 01:01:23,783
Nice to meet you.

1857
01:01:23,784 --> 01:01:25,543
(Sae Ho versus Se Yoon)

1858
01:01:25,544 --> 01:01:26,544
Rock-paper-scissors.

1859
01:01:26,545 --> 01:01:27,914
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1860
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,013
(Se Yoon gets to shoot first.)

1861
01:01:29,014 --> 01:01:30,423
- See? I got this.
- He has good energy.

1862
01:01:30,424 --> 01:01:32,454
- He got this.
- It doesn't mean anything.

1863
01:01:32,554 --> 01:01:33,924
- It means nothing.
- Right.

1864
01:01:34,154 --> 01:01:35,294
Bye, my friend.

1865
01:01:40,994 --> 01:01:43,333
"You gave me spicy rockfish stew."

1866
01:01:43,334 --> 01:01:44,334
(Shaking)

1867
01:01:44,335 --> 01:01:46,464
Goodbye.

1868
01:01:47,074 --> 01:01:48,373
(Pulling)

1869
01:01:48,374 --> 01:01:49,703
(Sae Ho passed.)

1870
01:01:49,704 --> 01:01:50,803
He got this.

1871
01:01:50,804 --> 01:01:53,173
That was a great move.

1872
01:01:53,174 --> 01:01:55,143
- I have to eat now. I'm hungry!
- Sae Ho.

1873
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:56,413
(The probability of a changeover is 1 in 5.)

1874
01:01:56,414 --> 01:01:58,614
Jong Cho Joon!

1875
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:03,184
(The table has turned.)

1876
01:02:03,524 --> 01:02:04,524
I have to eat.

1877
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:05,854
No, you shoot.

1878
01:02:05,924 --> 01:02:08,254
We spent good times together.

1879
01:02:08,554 --> 01:02:09,893
If this is the second trigger...

1880
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:11,424
Can I lose right after DinDin?

1881
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:12,494
I had fun.

1882
01:02:13,194 --> 01:02:14,834
(Triggering)

1883
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,493
My friend.

1884
01:02:16,494 --> 01:02:17,634
Gosh, now we're at a risk.

1885
01:02:18,004 --> 01:02:19,334
Now I have the chance.

1886
01:02:19,564 --> 01:02:21,034
I don't feel good about this one.

1887
01:02:22,734 --> 01:02:24,703
Now that I think about it, it has been a year since you got married.

1888
01:02:24,704 --> 01:02:26,404
But I haven't celebrated it for you yet.

1889
01:02:27,714 --> 01:02:28,744
Goodbye.

1890
01:02:29,174 --> 01:02:30,514
Congratulations.

1891
01:02:30,884 --> 01:02:32,184
(Screaming)

1892
01:02:35,684 --> 01:02:38,154
(Sae Ho survived again.)

1893
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:40,824
(Screaming)

1894
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:42,594
It's dangerous now.

1895
01:02:43,864 --> 01:02:45,163
(Now the odds are 1 in 3.)

1896
01:02:45,164 --> 01:02:47,594
Unfortunately, I wasn't congratulated.

1897
01:02:48,764 --> 01:02:51,804
(Feeling dizzy)

1898
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:54,034
The chance of success is 33 percent.

1899
01:02:54,174 --> 01:02:56,704
But if it comes to me, it will become 50 percent.

1900
01:02:57,044 --> 01:02:58,044
I know that.

1901
01:02:59,044 --> 01:03:00,544
It's going to burst this time.

1902
01:03:00,874 --> 01:03:04,084
(If it bursts now, Team Jong Cho Joon will win.)

1903
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:06,714
I'll always cheer for you, Se Yoon.

1904
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:09,582
I'll always cheer for you, Se Yoon.

1905
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:12,299
I'll always cheer for you, Se Yoon.

1906
01:03:16,497 --> 01:03:17,927
(Clicking)

1907
01:03:18,057 --> 01:03:22,637
(Laughing)

1908
01:03:23,037 --> 01:03:24,596
(The chances are 50 percent now.)

1909
01:03:24,597 --> 01:03:26,566
You got it. It's 50 percent now.

1910
01:03:26,567 --> 01:03:28,707
(He's speechless.)

1911
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:31,367
What are you going to do now?

1912
01:03:32,807 --> 01:03:33,907
(Laughing)

1913
01:03:35,817 --> 01:03:36,817
(The tables have been turned.)

1914
01:03:36,818 --> 01:03:37,978
What are you going to do now?

1915
01:03:38,277 --> 01:03:40,997
You should have gotten rid of me when you had the 33-percent chance.

1916
01:03:41,087 --> 01:03:42,357
This is...

1917
01:03:42,687 --> 01:03:44,456
It's a 50-percent chance now.

1918
01:03:44,457 --> 01:03:45,557
This...

1919
01:03:46,427 --> 01:03:48,067
If it doesn't burst now, it will be over.

1920
01:03:48,487 --> 01:03:49,656
Don't make it come to me.

1921
01:03:49,657 --> 01:03:51,796
(If it bursts, Se Yoon will win. If it doesn't, Sae Ho will win.)

1922
01:03:51,797 --> 01:03:53,327
- Spare me.
- Goodbye!

1923
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:58,267
Cho Sae Ho!

1924
01:03:58,937 --> 01:04:00,566
- Spare me.
- Goodbye!

1925
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:03,937
Cho Sae Ho!

1926
01:04:07,147 --> 01:04:09,677
- It was amazing.
- It was thrilling.

1927
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:11,976
- It was so fun.
- It's exciting

1928
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:13,346
- I said I'd do it, right?
- Great.

1929
01:04:13,347 --> 01:04:15,716
- Your ability has been recognized.
- It shouldn't have come to this.

1930
01:04:15,717 --> 01:04:17,556
It went on for quite long.

1931
01:04:17,557 --> 01:04:18,656
- Okay...
- It lasted quite long.

1932
01:04:18,657 --> 01:04:19,687
I'm so nervous.

1933
01:04:20,087 --> 01:04:21,427
It's 1 to 1.

1934
01:04:22,157 --> 01:04:23,556
(Final Round: Jong Min versus Seon Ho)

1935
01:04:23,557 --> 01:04:24,597
It lasted quite long.

1936
01:04:24,897 --> 01:04:26,327
- It won't...
- This is crazy.

1937
01:04:26,627 --> 01:04:27,797
I'm nervous.

1938
01:04:27,967 --> 01:04:29,496
He already lost...

1939
01:04:29,497 --> 01:04:31,043
- when he left the gun behind.
- That's right.

1940
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:32,966
- No. He did that to use this gun.
- Right.

1941
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:34,737
- It was to use this gun.
- That's right.

1942
01:04:35,007 --> 01:04:36,076
This is the last round.

1943
01:04:36,077 --> 01:04:37,077
- It's the last round.
- Yes.

1944
01:04:37,078 --> 01:04:38,406
- It's the last round.
- Okay.

1945
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,246
Since you have a round face, I'll go with rock.

1946
01:04:40,247 --> 01:04:41,247
- Rock?
- Yes.

1947
01:04:41,248 --> 01:04:42,317
Okay.

1948
01:04:42,477 --> 01:04:44,077
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

1949
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:47,487
(Seon Ho went with rock as he said.)

1950
01:04:49,317 --> 01:04:51,717
- I was truthful.
- We only say the truth to him.

1951
01:04:51,957 --> 01:04:53,626
He just doesn't trust people.

1952
01:04:53,627 --> 01:04:54,827
Right.

1953
01:04:55,527 --> 01:04:56,956
You should settle it.

1954
01:04:56,957 --> 01:04:58,457
Don't give it to him. End it at once.

1955
01:04:58,627 --> 01:04:59,896
My heart started beating fast.

1956
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:01,626
- Go on.
- I'm hungry, Seon Ho.

1957
01:05:01,627 --> 01:05:03,097
- You should eat too.
- At one go.

1958
01:05:03,337 --> 01:05:04,836
Do it like you're acting.

1959
01:05:04,837 --> 01:05:06,483
Show tears and say, "Why did you do that?"

1960
01:05:06,507 --> 01:05:08,977
- Ready, cue!
- Cue!

1961
01:05:10,007 --> 01:05:11,907
- Why did you do that to me?
- That's nice.

1962
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:15,177
You humiliated me.

1963
01:05:17,177 --> 01:05:19,247
(He shoots suddenly.)

1964
01:05:19,747 --> 01:05:21,747
(Jong Min passed.)

1965
01:05:21,787 --> 01:05:25,456
Let's go. Scene two of "Dumb Sheriff."

1966
01:05:25,457 --> 01:05:26,926
- "Dumb Sheriff."
- "Dumb Sheriff."

1967
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:28,603
(A fool who picked up a gun on the street)

1968
01:05:28,627 --> 01:05:30,457
You're dead, you fool!

1969
01:05:30,797 --> 01:05:32,096
You annoyed me.

1970
01:05:32,097 --> 01:05:33,596
- Last one.
- You annoyed me.

1971
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:35,327
Why did you annoy me, you young boy?

1972
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:39,237
(Seon Ho passed.)

1973
01:05:39,307 --> 01:05:42,237
- What is this?
- Yes!

1974
01:05:42,437 --> 01:05:44,377
- It's back.
- Take it back.

1975
01:05:44,477 --> 01:05:46,197
Say one more line. It's about the momentum.

1976
01:05:46,577 --> 01:05:49,347
Scene seven of the movie "My Name is Yoo Seon Ho."

1977
01:05:49,717 --> 01:05:52,946
I worked like a dog under you for four years! Why?

1978
01:05:52,947 --> 01:05:54,117
What? What did I do?

1979
01:05:55,387 --> 01:05:56,587
My name is Yoo Seon Ho.

1980
01:05:56,887 --> 01:05:57,887
I'll shoot.

1981
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:00,627
I'm not the Yoo Seon Ho you used to know.

1982
01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:04,356
- One, two...
- It bursts?

1983
01:06:04,357 --> 01:06:06,797
(He survived it again.)

1984
01:06:07,027 --> 01:06:10,797
(It's playing with their hearts.)

1985
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,736
- It's risky.
- It's 33 percent.

1986
01:06:13,737 --> 01:06:16,476
- It's...
- If he misses, you have 50 percent.

1987
01:06:16,477 --> 01:06:18,846
Movie "Lacking but Kind-hearted Sheriff."

1988
01:06:18,847 --> 01:06:20,183
(The chances become 50 percent after this turn.)

1989
01:06:20,207 --> 01:06:21,276
(Massaging)

1990
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,577
Scene eight.

1991
01:06:23,117 --> 01:06:24,947
You should have killed me.

1992
01:06:26,617 --> 01:06:27,686
I'll kill you.

1993
01:06:27,687 --> 01:06:29,293
- I have a good feeling about this.
- I won't die so easily.

1994
01:06:29,317 --> 01:06:30,417
Goodbye!

1995
01:06:34,627 --> 01:06:35,697
Goodbye!

1996
01:06:39,097 --> 01:06:40,497
It burst.

1997
01:06:42,537 --> 01:06:45,937
(The celebration shot was brilliantly fired.)

1998
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:51,207
(He's disappointed.)

1999
01:06:51,377 --> 01:06:54,006
(The Dumb Sheriff did it.)

2000
01:06:54,007 --> 01:06:56,716
- Sheriff.
- Sheriff.

2001
01:06:56,717 --> 01:06:57,777
Goodness.

2002
01:06:58,517 --> 01:06:59,846
I really have to eat.

2003
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:01,446
The sheriff.

2004
01:07:01,447 --> 01:07:03,717
As a result of I'll Rockfish Shoot You,

2005
01:07:04,057 --> 01:07:06,256
Team Jong Cho Joon earned lunch...

2006
01:07:06,257 --> 01:07:08,386
and six slots of the spinning wheel.

2007
01:07:08,387 --> 01:07:10,327
- Yes!
- In total,

2008
01:07:10,857 --> 01:07:13,797
it's 7 to 11.

2009
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:16,697
It ended like this when we won all the rock-paper-scissor rounds.

2010
01:07:16,737 --> 01:07:18,836
We'll prepare the meal right away.

2011
01:07:18,837 --> 01:07:20,336
- Okay.
- I really need to eat.

2012
01:07:20,337 --> 01:07:22,217
It's okay. It's about luck. It can't be helped.

2013
01:07:22,337 --> 01:07:23,806
Amazing.

2014
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:25,436
It's that big?

2015
01:07:25,437 --> 01:07:26,876
- That's crazy.
- It's crazy.

2016
01:07:26,877 --> 01:07:27,946
That's a rockfish?

2017
01:07:27,947 --> 01:07:28,976
(Just looking at it makes your mouth water.)

2018
01:07:28,977 --> 01:07:30,716
- It's crazy.
- This is crazy.

2019
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:33,086
- It looks really good.
- I really love raw freshwater fish.

2020
01:07:33,087 --> 01:07:34,247
I envy you, Jong Min.

2021
01:07:34,317 --> 01:07:35,816
Can't we all eat together today?

2022
01:07:35,817 --> 01:07:37,116
- You can't.
- We want to,

2023
01:07:37,117 --> 01:07:39,556
but that doesn't really fit the purpose of 2 Days 1 Night.

2024
01:07:39,557 --> 01:07:41,787
- Hello.
- Hello.

2025
01:07:42,897 --> 01:07:44,626
- The smell.
- This is driving me crazy.

2026
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,466
- Let's pull it closer.
- Let's eat.

2027
01:07:46,467 --> 01:07:48,427
It's a rockfish.

2028
01:07:50,137 --> 01:07:51,637
It looks so good.

2029
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:54,266
The texture of a raw rockfish...

2030
01:07:54,267 --> 01:07:55,566
is similar to that of a saw-edged perch.

2031
01:07:55,567 --> 01:07:56,837
Really?

2032
01:07:57,707 --> 01:08:00,406
It looks similar to a seabream.

2033
01:08:00,407 --> 01:08:02,416
It doesn't look like raw rockfish.

2034
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:04,116
In my ten years of filming eating shows,

2035
01:08:04,117 --> 01:08:05,816
I've never eaten that.

2036
01:08:05,817 --> 01:08:06,916
You haven't tried raw rockfish?

2037
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:08,616
I haven't tried raw rockfish.

2038
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,156
Thank you for the food.

2039
01:08:10,157 --> 01:08:12,056
Should I get two pieces?

2040
01:08:12,057 --> 01:08:14,127
- Eat it simply.
- Simply. With soy sauce.

2041
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:15,387
I'll dip it.

2042
01:08:16,157 --> 01:08:17,556
I'll eat it right away.

2043
01:08:17,557 --> 01:08:19,597
(They eat it at once.)

2044
01:08:20,327 --> 01:08:21,967
(Amazed)

2045
01:08:22,297 --> 01:08:24,167
It's really chewy.

2046
01:08:24,497 --> 01:08:26,366
It's really chewy.

2047
01:08:26,367 --> 01:08:27,466
It's different from the raw saltwater fish.

2048
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:28,736
It's amazing.

2049
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:29,806
The texture.

2050
01:08:29,807 --> 01:08:31,837
With a bit of exaggeration, it's even crunchy.

2051
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:33,347
- No way.
- Seriously.

2052
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,447
Goodness. He's lying.

2053
01:08:35,817 --> 01:08:36,847
Seriously.

2054
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:39,017
But it's...

2055
01:08:39,387 --> 01:08:41,546
very chewy...

2056
01:08:41,547 --> 01:08:42,887
and sticky.

2057
01:08:42,957 --> 01:08:44,786
It's very chewy and nice.

2058
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,526
It feels different. How is it different...

2059
01:08:46,527 --> 01:08:47,957
from the raw saltwater fish?

2060
01:08:48,127 --> 01:08:50,726
If you eat it in a wrap, the meaty texture would go away.

2061
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:52,397
(He makes a wrap and eats it.)

2062
01:08:52,497 --> 01:08:53,566
It's good.

2063
01:08:53,567 --> 01:08:55,227
It looks really good.

2064
01:08:55,697 --> 01:08:56,766
They can play rock-paper-scissors,

2065
01:08:56,767 --> 01:08:57,866
- and the person who wins...
- Right.

2066
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:59,606
- gets to eat one piece.
- I...

2067
01:08:59,607 --> 01:09:02,066
- Right. Just one piece.
- Okay.

2068
01:09:02,067 --> 01:09:04,177
- Okay.
- Not the wrap. That's a luxury.

2069
01:09:04,237 --> 01:09:06,876
We'll just check if what he's saying is true.

2070
01:09:06,877 --> 01:09:07,906
That's right.

2071
01:09:07,907 --> 01:09:09,876
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

2072
01:09:09,877 --> 01:09:11,617
- Okay.
- I lost.

2073
01:09:11,717 --> 01:09:13,416
(His first tasting of the raw rockfish is gone.)

2074
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:14,986
- But...
- I'll dip it.

2075
01:09:14,987 --> 01:09:16,556
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

2076
01:09:16,557 --> 01:09:17,886
(DinDin won.)

2077
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:18,917
He won.

2078
01:09:19,157 --> 01:09:20,187
Goodness.

2079
01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:21,856
(He's disappointed.)

2080
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:23,356
I'm so curious.

2081
01:09:23,357 --> 01:09:24,497
It's really good.

2082
01:09:25,157 --> 01:09:27,127
It's really good. It's crunchy.

2083
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:29,196
The texture is amazing.

2084
01:09:29,197 --> 01:09:31,637
It's very chewy and sticky.

2085
01:09:32,337 --> 01:09:33,766
- It's on a different level.
- Right.

2086
01:09:33,767 --> 01:09:34,807
It's good.

2087
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:37,006
- Is it crunchy?
- It's really chewy.

2088
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:38,007
You're lying.

2089
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:39,577
This is chewier...

2090
01:09:40,007 --> 01:09:42,577
- than a black seabream.
- Really?

2091
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:43,977
Let's eat this.

2092
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:45,716
Look at the rockfish.

2093
01:09:45,717 --> 01:09:47,087
- Look at the shrimp.
- The meat.

2094
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:48,747
It looks tasty.

2095
01:09:48,887 --> 01:09:50,116
Take it.

2096
01:09:50,117 --> 01:09:51,356
How many did they put in?

2097
01:09:51,357 --> 01:09:52,603
(The smell itself makes him lose his mind.)

2098
01:09:52,627 --> 01:09:53,686
(He gets some for the eldest first.)

2099
01:09:53,687 --> 01:09:56,457
He only gave him water parsley.

2100
01:09:56,627 --> 01:09:57,627
I'll do it.

2101
01:09:57,628 --> 01:09:59,526
- He didn't give him the rockfish.
- It's a spicy rockfish stew...

2102
01:09:59,527 --> 01:10:01,696
He didn't give Jong Min the rockfish meat.

2103
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,736
- He gave him sujebi.
- It's a dud.

2104
01:10:03,737 --> 01:10:04,897
An empty spicy stew.

2105
01:10:04,937 --> 01:10:06,336
He only gave me water parsley.

2106
01:10:06,337 --> 01:10:08,737
He only gave him water parsley and sujebi.

2107
01:10:08,867 --> 01:10:11,707
I gave him lots of vegetables because he said he liked them.

2108
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:14,747
(He tastes it without the rockfish first.)

2109
01:10:14,947 --> 01:10:16,817
It's really rich.

2110
01:10:17,247 --> 01:10:19,547
(Joon also tastes it.)

2111
01:10:19,847 --> 01:10:21,816
- The soup tastes great.
- The soup tastes amazing.

2112
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,786
I really love spicy fish stew.

2113
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:24,887
The soup is amazing.

2114
01:10:25,157 --> 01:10:26,626
- The soup tastes nice?
- It's really rich.

2115
01:10:26,627 --> 01:10:27,926
- The rockfish is moving.
- It's really rich.

2116
01:10:27,927 --> 01:10:29,127
It's different.

2117
01:10:29,257 --> 01:10:30,526
It's really good.

2118
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:31,527
(Exclaiming)

2119
01:10:31,528 --> 01:10:33,226
(It's so refreshing that it makes him exclaim like an old man.)

2120
01:10:33,227 --> 01:10:34,826
- It's amazing.
- It is, right?

2121
01:10:34,827 --> 01:10:36,766
I won't eat it. Give me some soup so I can just smell it.

2122
01:10:36,767 --> 01:10:38,237
I'll just smell it.

2123
01:10:38,437 --> 01:10:39,707
Goodness.

2124
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:40,937
It's so refreshing.

2125
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,407
It really makes you relaxed.

2126
01:10:43,977 --> 01:10:45,536
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

2127
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:47,776
- It's really good.
- It's really good.

2128
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:49,246
It's so good.

2129
01:10:49,247 --> 01:10:50,567
- It's crazy.
- It's really rich.

2130
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,376
What is the rockfish good for?

2131
01:10:52,377 --> 01:10:55,486
Rockfish is rich in protein and amino acids,

2132
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,956
making it great for boosting energy.

2133
01:10:56,957 --> 01:10:59,586
It also helps with fatigue recovery and liver function.

2134
01:10:59,587 --> 01:11:01,356
- I really need that.
- Nice.

2135
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:03,756
This is really a health-boosting meal.

2136
01:11:03,757 --> 01:11:06,166
Was my energy level low lately?

2137
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:08,226
I'm sweating so much.

2138
01:11:08,227 --> 01:11:11,067
It feels like having a detox.

2139
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:13,337
I guess all the bad things were on your face.

2140
01:11:14,307 --> 01:11:16,407
(Frustrated)

2141
01:11:16,577 --> 01:11:18,576
The team that lost should eat too.

2142
01:11:18,577 --> 01:11:19,806
Please bring the meal.

2143
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,907
The soup is amazing.

2144
01:11:21,147 --> 01:11:22,447
It really is a young pollack.

2145
01:11:22,617 --> 01:11:24,177
- Really?
- That looks tasty.

2146
01:11:24,347 --> 01:11:26,027
Why was it pressed? Is it a young pollack?

2147
01:11:26,187 --> 01:11:28,086
You couldn't win the rockfish,

2148
01:11:28,087 --> 01:11:29,887
so we prepared young pollack.

2149
01:11:29,987 --> 01:11:31,556
(Cursing with his eyes)

2150
01:11:31,557 --> 01:11:33,956
- That must feel awful.
- I can't believe it.

2151
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:36,157
I feel upset even though it's not my business.

2152
01:11:36,357 --> 01:11:40,227
The garlic scapes from Danyang were specially served as well.

2153
01:11:40,567 --> 01:11:42,697
Not pieces of garlic? Garlic scapes?

2154
01:11:43,497 --> 01:11:45,966
Can we not put in the young pollack as well?

2155
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:47,127
I'm afraid that can't happen.

2156
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:48,937
I'm eating to survive.

2157
01:11:51,437 --> 01:11:52,477
Thank you.

2158
01:11:53,407 --> 01:11:55,167
It will be good with the gochujang, I guess.

2159
01:11:55,207 --> 01:11:56,617
The garlic scapes are good.

2160
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,547
The garlic scapes are good.

2161
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,917
- They're so good.
- The garlic scapes are very good.

2162
01:12:01,447 --> 01:12:03,047
It's possible. Will you join in as well?

2163
01:12:03,187 --> 01:12:04,627
It'll be better when mixed together.

2164
01:12:04,657 --> 01:12:06,227
(Garlic scapes)

2165
01:12:06,387 --> 01:12:07,726
Gosh, that looks so good.

2166
01:12:07,727 --> 01:12:10,056
I'll give it a try. Let's take turns if it's good.

2167
01:12:10,057 --> 01:12:12,667
(He gets a big spoonful.)

2168
01:12:13,427 --> 01:12:14,927
That looks good.

2169
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:17,197
(Taking a big bite)

2170
01:12:17,497 --> 01:12:18,867
I do want to try some of that.

2171
01:12:19,707 --> 01:12:20,707
(Give it a try.)

2172
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:21,937
It's that good?

2173
01:12:22,537 --> 01:12:24,236
Place a piece of young pollack on top.

2174
01:12:24,237 --> 01:12:25,757
Place a piece of young pollack on top.

2175
01:12:25,947 --> 01:12:27,046
It's really good.

2176
01:12:27,047 --> 01:12:28,746
(Putting in a spoonful)

2177
01:12:28,747 --> 01:12:29,976
Gosh, it's amazing, isn't it?

2178
01:12:29,977 --> 01:12:32,377
(It's delicious!)

2179
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,386
Jong Min, try a bite.

2180
01:12:36,387 --> 01:12:38,157
- It's good.
- It's really good.

2181
01:12:38,557 --> 01:12:40,457
- The young pollack is...
- There you go.

2182
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:41,726
Gosh, it's good.

2183
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,996
Did should be sold as a side dish for 12 dollars.

2184
01:12:43,997 --> 01:12:45,157
This is so much better.

2185
01:12:46,267 --> 01:12:47,396
(Upset)

2186
01:12:47,397 --> 01:12:48,527
(Who doesn't know that?)

2187
01:12:48,827 --> 01:12:50,066
You all enjoyed your meal, right?

2188
01:12:50,067 --> 01:12:51,096
- Yes.
- Yes.

2189
01:12:51,097 --> 01:12:53,206
We will move to the next spot...

2190
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:55,166
to enjoy fall some more.

2191
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:58,176
Please wait here for a while as we finish setting up.

2192
01:12:58,177 --> 01:12:59,846
- Okay.
- The soup was amazing.

2193
01:12:59,847 --> 01:13:01,076
I couldn't stop drinking the soup.

2194
01:13:01,077 --> 01:13:02,716
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2195
01:13:02,717 --> 01:13:03,847
Thank you.

2196
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:06,817
(The thrilling lunch comes to an end.)

2197
01:13:07,487 --> 01:13:08,887
What's the rockfish?

2198
01:13:09,087 --> 01:13:10,316
- The one right there.
- That fish?

2199
01:13:10,317 --> 01:13:11,686
That one?

2200
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:13,426
So that's the rockfish?

2201
01:13:13,427 --> 01:13:14,626
(They finally encounter the rockfish up close.)

2202
01:13:14,627 --> 01:13:16,347
You were talking about the Korean bullhead.

2203
01:13:16,627 --> 01:13:18,396
- This is the Korean bullhead.
- Right.

2204
01:13:18,397 --> 01:13:19,926
- I see.
- The big one is the catfish.

2205
01:13:19,927 --> 01:13:20,996
The biggest one?

2206
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:22,566
(Music starts playing all of a sudden.)

2207
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:24,136
(And there are 6 chairs placed?)

2208
01:13:24,137 --> 01:13:25,766
- The big one is the catfish.
- What's the biggest one?

2209
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:27,413
- A carp. Is that a carp?
- That one is...

2210
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:28,937
- It's a shark.
- That's a catfish?

2211
01:13:29,067 --> 01:13:30,407
- That one...
- That's a catfish?

2212
01:13:30,507 --> 01:13:32,336
This must be the rockfish.

2213
01:13:32,337 --> 01:13:33,346
(Something is up.)

2214
01:13:33,347 --> 01:13:35,306
- What's going on?
- Don't sit now!

2215
01:13:35,307 --> 01:13:36,376
(Running instinctively)

2216
01:13:36,377 --> 01:13:37,647
- Don't sit?
- No.

2217
01:13:37,977 --> 01:13:39,617
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

2218
01:13:40,017 --> 01:13:42,486
(What do you think? You're supposed to dance.)

2219
01:13:42,487 --> 01:13:43,556
Go around!

2220
01:13:43,557 --> 01:13:45,086
- Go around!
- Go around!

2221
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,903
(They all go around after hearing from the eldest.)

2222
01:13:46,927 --> 01:13:48,767
(They go around in circles around the chairs.)

2223
01:13:48,827 --> 01:13:49,827
Six!

2224
01:13:50,157 --> 01:13:52,196
(Quickly...)

2225
01:13:52,197 --> 01:13:53,626
(getting a seat)

2226
01:13:53,627 --> 01:13:54,667
Six!

2227
01:13:54,767 --> 01:13:56,096
(Sinking down)

2228
01:13:56,097 --> 01:13:57,137
- Six?
- Six.

2229
01:13:57,797 --> 01:13:59,967
(Sae Ho is the only one who couldn't find a seat.)

2230
01:14:01,207 --> 01:14:02,907
- Six.
- What's going on?

2231
01:14:03,707 --> 01:14:04,707
- What?
- Six.

2232
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:06,547
(Sitting high up on his own)

2233
01:14:06,607 --> 01:14:07,776
- What?
- Six.

2234
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,276
(But there are 6 chairs and 6 people?)

2235
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:10,646
- All right.
- What's going on?

2236
01:14:10,647 --> 01:14:12,847
The one who is sitting higher up than everyone else.

2237
01:14:13,087 --> 01:14:15,047
It's Cho Sae Ho.

2238
01:14:15,587 --> 01:14:17,156
You are the winner. Congratulations.

2239
01:14:17,157 --> 01:14:18,656
(Sae Ho suddenly becomes the winner?)

2240
01:14:18,657 --> 01:14:19,727
- What?
- What?

2241
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,557
- Gosh!
- What was that?

2242
01:14:23,227 --> 01:14:24,357
What's going on?

2243
01:14:25,897 --> 01:14:27,496
(You even get a party hat.)

2244
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:28,626
- What?
- It's a good thing!

2245
01:14:28,627 --> 01:14:29,636
What is that for?

2246
01:14:29,637 --> 01:14:30,996
(Feeling excited with the party hat)

2247
01:14:30,997 --> 01:14:31,997
What's going on?

2248
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:33,907
What is he the winner of?

2249
01:14:34,307 --> 01:14:35,566
- What's going on after our meal?
- I don't know what it is,

2250
01:14:35,567 --> 01:14:36,607
but I'm jealous.

2251
01:14:36,737 --> 01:14:38,777
- Does he get dessert?
- Dessert? Perhaps coffee?

2252
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:41,077
(An exciting dance performance of the winner)

2253
01:14:41,647 --> 01:14:43,277
My hips won't stop moving.

2254
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:46,286
Let's move.

2255
01:14:46,287 --> 01:14:47,586
My hips won't stop moving.

2256
01:14:47,587 --> 01:14:48,986
It's not a good thing!

2257
01:14:48,987 --> 01:14:50,533
- He must be hiking!
- It's not a good thing.

2258
01:14:50,557 --> 01:14:51,586
- Team Security is out.
- Really?

2259
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:53,063
- It's not a good thing.
- He must be paragliding!

2260
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:54,927
It's not a good thing if Team Security is out.

2261
01:14:55,027 --> 01:14:58,127
(Keeping a distance instinctively)

2262
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,867
He's terrible at fighting. Just take him.

2263
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:01,996
(He gets caught without putting up a fight.)

2264
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:02,997
Let us move.

2265
01:15:03,397 --> 01:15:04,836
- Let us move.
- He's above everyone else.

2266
01:15:04,837 --> 01:15:06,366
He must be paragliding or hiking.

2267
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,367
He must be hiking.

2268
01:15:07,637 --> 01:15:08,667
- Really?
- Hold on.

2269
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:09,977
Are you serious?

2270
01:15:10,377 --> 01:15:11,837
He's so pitiful.

2271
01:15:12,037 --> 01:15:13,607
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

2272
01:15:14,647 --> 01:15:16,276
- I just leave like this?
- It's definitely a mountain.

2273
01:15:16,277 --> 01:15:17,517
I just leave like this?

2274
01:15:17,577 --> 01:15:18,577
I just leave like this?

2275
01:15:19,817 --> 01:15:21,317
You're the winner.

2276
01:15:21,487 --> 01:15:23,516
What is all of this? Gosh.

2277
01:15:23,517 --> 01:15:24,517
What's going on?

2278
01:15:25,017 --> 01:15:26,556
They say you'll be at a higher place.

2279
01:15:26,557 --> 01:15:27,757
- What?
- Go up high.

2280
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,196
- What's going on?
- It started with six chairs anyway.

2281
01:15:30,197 --> 01:15:31,356
- Hold on.
- What was that?

2282
01:15:31,357 --> 01:15:33,066
It was just based on luck.

2283
01:15:33,067 --> 01:15:34,467
- Right.
- Total luck.

2284
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:37,967
(Chair Game)

2285
01:15:38,497 --> 01:15:40,507
(Unlike the chairs that sinked down right away, )

2286
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:43,577
(Sae Ho's chair stood firm.)

2287
01:15:43,977 --> 01:15:46,346
(It just didn't seem like it because of their heights.)

2288
01:15:46,347 --> 01:15:49,047
All right. The other chairs all sinked down.

2289
01:15:49,307 --> 01:15:51,647
No wonder. It sinked down.

2290
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,246
(Joon tries sitting on Sae Ho's chair.)

2291
01:15:54,247 --> 01:15:56,886
- This chair doesn't sink down.
- It doesn't sink down.

2292
01:15:56,887 --> 01:15:58,586
It was just for one person?

2293
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,187
- Is it a good thing?
- Do I just leave?

2294
01:16:00,957 --> 01:16:01,957
Do I just leave?

2295
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,956
(Sae Ho feels dumbfounded.)

2296
01:16:03,957 --> 01:16:05,697
- Bye!
- Where are you going?

2297
01:16:05,797 --> 01:16:07,027
I don't know where I'm going.

2298
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:08,827
How do I go without knowing where I'm going!

2299
01:16:09,597 --> 01:16:12,767
(Sae Ho departs while leaving a legendary phrase.)

2300
01:16:13,637 --> 01:16:16,607
(The car starts moving although he doesn't know where he's going.)

2301
01:16:17,037 --> 01:16:18,236
- Hee Sung.
- Yes?

2302
01:16:18,237 --> 01:16:19,237
Where are we going?

2303
01:16:19,337 --> 01:16:21,547
I just got out from lunch. All of a sudden,

2304
01:16:22,747 --> 01:16:24,907
I'm heading somewhere after the party popper went off.

2305
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:27,047
- Is it just me?
- Yes.

2306
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:29,617
Where am I going alone?

2307
01:16:29,787 --> 01:16:31,463
There are a lot of fun activities in Danyang.

2308
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:32,857
I know that, but...

2309
01:16:33,257 --> 01:16:34,903
I'm sent there all of a sudden just like this?

2310
01:16:34,927 --> 01:16:36,227
You're the winner.

2311
01:16:36,697 --> 01:16:38,497
- But...
- You'll be sent to a great place.

2312
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:40,396
(The car heads somewhere as he feels anxious.)

2313
01:16:40,397 --> 01:16:42,667
Gosh, the view is great here.

2314
01:16:42,997 --> 01:16:44,096
It's stunning.

2315
01:16:44,097 --> 01:16:46,067
It's beautiful. It's a spectacular sight.

2316
01:16:47,107 --> 01:16:51,177
(The beautiful scenery makes him forget about his anxiety.)

2317
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,106
(The color of nature...)

2318
01:16:53,107 --> 01:16:54,846
It's beautiful here.

2319
01:16:54,847 --> 01:16:56,147
(paints even the heart.)

2320
01:16:56,477 --> 01:16:58,346
The weather is great, isn't it?

2321
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:00,887
(A pleasant weather with the warm sunlight and clear breeze)

2322
01:17:00,947 --> 01:17:03,087
There are times when we say the weather is clear.

2323
01:17:03,187 --> 01:17:04,556
This is the perfect time to say that.

2324
01:17:04,557 --> 01:17:07,457
(Fall, the season when the sky goes up higher)

2325
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:10,227
(Sae Ho enjoys the fall weather.)

2326
01:17:10,357 --> 01:17:11,827
Where are the members going then?

2327
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:15,296
The members will head out to enjoy fall as well.

2328
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,197
- Without me?
- Yes.

2329
01:17:20,307 --> 01:17:22,307
How would I enjoy fall on my own?

2330
01:17:22,407 --> 01:17:23,676
Am I hiking on my own?

2331
01:17:23,677 --> 01:17:24,937
(Am I hiking on my own?)

2332
01:17:25,837 --> 01:17:29,007
(Fall hiking on his own?)

2333
01:17:30,177 --> 01:17:31,417
Paragliding?

2334
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:32,987
Is it paragliding?

2335
01:17:33,847 --> 01:17:37,657
(Paragliding alone in Danyang where it's famous for?)

2336
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:40,927
A cave? It says there's a cave.

2337
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:43,968
(A cave expedition on his own as it says there's a cave?)

2338
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:46,126
(Where is Sae Ho headed?)

2339
01:17:46,127 --> 01:17:48,127
I think we're going up a mountain.

2340
01:17:49,567 --> 01:17:50,666
Aren't I right?

2341
01:17:50,667 --> 01:17:53,407
(Feeling anxious)

2342
01:17:53,867 --> 01:17:55,967
We've come up quite a lot already.

2343
01:17:57,107 --> 01:18:02,147
(Sae Ho has gone up quite a lot to where he can see the top.)

2344
01:18:03,717 --> 01:18:05,646
(He loses it in the end.)

2345
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:07,717
I'm starting to laugh. Gosh.

2346
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:09,957
We're going so high up.

2347
01:18:10,257 --> 01:18:11,316
Gosh, I'm feeling nervous.

2348
01:18:11,317 --> 01:18:13,357
My heart is trembling.

2349
01:18:14,287 --> 01:18:15,356
What is this place?

2350
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,596
(He arrives somewhere while feeling fear and anxiety.)

2351
01:18:17,597 --> 01:18:19,157
We're here. Gosh.

2352
01:18:21,597 --> 01:18:25,496
(Where has Sae Ho been sent to?)

2353
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:27,267
- Then...
- Yes?

2354
01:18:27,637 --> 01:18:29,777
- What do we do without him?
- What do we do?

2355
01:18:30,107 --> 01:18:31,507
- As for us, - Do we get to rest?

2356
01:18:31,877 --> 01:18:33,706
We will head over for something else.

2357
01:18:33,707 --> 01:18:35,146
- We're doing something else?
- Something else?

2358
01:18:35,147 --> 01:18:36,316
Let's get going.

2359
01:18:36,317 --> 01:18:37,517
- Where are we going?
- Where?

2360
01:18:37,717 --> 01:18:39,077
To our next destination.

2361
01:18:39,377 --> 01:18:41,446
- Okay. Let's go!
- This is unbelievable.

2362
01:18:41,447 --> 01:18:42,686
What is this?

2363
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,447
What kind of high place has he been sent to?

2364
01:18:44,717 --> 01:18:47,187
It would be strange to leave out paragliding in Danyang.

2365
01:18:47,687 --> 01:18:50,026
They should've chosen two people for that.

2366
01:18:50,027 --> 01:18:51,997
- Just one more person.
- Do you want to do it?

2367
01:18:52,157 --> 01:18:54,596
I want to do it. I love paragliding.

2368
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:56,397
- Really?
- It's great fun.

2369
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,766
As long it's not bungee jumping or skydiving,

2370
01:18:58,767 --> 01:18:59,767
it's fine.

2371
01:18:59,837 --> 01:19:01,337
Bungee jumping is tough.

2372
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:03,576
Skydiving is intense as well.

2373
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:04,836
- Skydiving is tough.
- It seems like it.

2374
01:19:04,837 --> 01:19:06,647
You drop down much faster than you think.

2375
01:19:07,577 --> 01:19:09,007
Gosh, I'm jealous.

2376
01:19:10,047 --> 01:19:13,046
We might not yet be safe.

2377
01:19:13,047 --> 01:19:15,016
- We're safe.
- He already left.

2378
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:17,887
The sun will set soon.

2379
01:19:18,057 --> 01:19:20,287
It's 1:30pm and you're saying the sun will set soon?

2380
01:19:20,387 --> 01:19:21,957
Well...

2381
01:19:22,427 --> 01:19:24,297
You have wings on your shirt as well.

2382
01:19:24,657 --> 01:19:25,897
Are you serious?

2383
01:19:26,397 --> 01:19:27,996
- There are wings?
- I'd love to do it though.

2384
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:29,573
(Joon's outfit with wings feels ominous for some reason.)

2385
01:19:29,597 --> 01:19:31,167
- Can you do it, Jong Min?
- No.

2386
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,396
- Jong Min.
- It's impossible.

2387
01:19:32,397 --> 01:19:33,713
(Where are the members headed to?)

2388
01:19:33,737 --> 01:19:35,236
(Looking around)

2389
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:36,336
Where are we going?

2390
01:19:36,337 --> 01:19:37,817
(He senses something that feels off.)

2391
01:19:37,877 --> 01:19:40,406
- Why are we going up?
- Yes?

2392
01:19:40,407 --> 01:19:41,547
We are...

2393
01:19:42,307 --> 01:19:43,587
heading to our next destination.

2394
01:19:43,817 --> 01:19:46,647
Why is our next destination up high?

2395
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:48,486
(Feeling anxious)

2396
01:19:48,487 --> 01:19:50,556
- Are we paragliding?
- No way!

2397
01:19:50,557 --> 01:19:51,557
No way!

2398
01:19:51,558 --> 01:19:52,916
(Tell us that's not true.)

2399
01:19:52,917 --> 01:19:53,987
No way!

2400
01:19:54,257 --> 01:19:55,527
What are we going up for?

2401
01:19:55,687 --> 01:19:57,996
We have to stay down if we are going to watch Sae Ho come down.

2402
01:19:57,997 --> 01:19:59,196
- Right.
- Right.

2403
01:19:59,197 --> 01:20:00,296
There's no point waiting up high.

2404
01:20:00,297 --> 01:20:01,326
We have to stay down for that.

2405
01:20:01,327 --> 01:20:02,943
You were fussing about wanting to do it earlier.

2406
01:20:02,967 --> 01:20:05,937
But it doesn't feel right if we're actually going for it.

2407
01:20:06,097 --> 01:20:07,306
You're just...

2408
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:08,867
a pile of bluff, aren't you?

2409
01:20:09,707 --> 01:20:12,076
I've never seen you keep your word.

2410
01:20:12,077 --> 01:20:13,753
(He was bluffing thinking that he wouldn't be doing it.)

2411
01:20:13,777 --> 01:20:16,277
(Dumbfounded)

2412
01:20:16,347 --> 01:20:19,646
You were causing a fuss about wanting to do it.

2413
01:20:19,647 --> 01:20:21,447
But I actually don't want to do it.

2414
01:20:22,687 --> 01:20:24,356
(His true heart gets revealed.)

2415
01:20:24,357 --> 01:20:27,226
What's going on? He's your junior singer.

2416
01:20:27,227 --> 01:20:28,456
(Is that so?)

2417
01:20:28,457 --> 01:20:29,927
(Clicking)

2418
01:20:30,057 --> 01:20:32,497
(He sorts out his junior with his gun.)

2419
01:20:32,597 --> 01:20:36,367
You must be someone who speaks the truth when something happens.

2420
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:37,867
- Right?
- I'm sorry.

2421
01:20:39,437 --> 01:20:41,466
- Why is the slope so steep?
- Hold on.

2422
01:20:41,467 --> 01:20:43,736
It's so strange. Why are we going so high up?

2423
01:20:43,737 --> 01:20:46,577
What would be this high up?

2424
01:20:46,877 --> 01:20:48,446
We're going up to fall off.

2425
01:20:48,447 --> 01:20:49,506
Could it be that?

2426
01:20:49,507 --> 01:20:50,546
(The bus goes up endlessly.)

2427
01:20:50,547 --> 01:20:51,746
It's so high up here.

2428
01:20:51,747 --> 01:20:52,846
(The bus goes up endlessly.)

2429
01:20:52,847 --> 01:20:55,217
- It's so high up.
- What's going on today?

2430
01:20:55,887 --> 01:20:58,186
What are we going through today?

2431
01:20:58,187 --> 01:20:59,726
Isn't this for skydiving?

2432
01:20:59,727 --> 01:21:01,486
Aren't we too high up?

2433
01:21:01,487 --> 01:21:02,887
It's so high up here.

2434
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:10,897
(A place full of pastries)

2435
01:21:11,897 --> 01:21:14,466
- Jong Min. I have a feeling...
- Where are we?

2436
01:21:14,467 --> 01:21:16,313
We get to eat the pastries while Sae Ho goes paragliding.

2437
01:21:16,337 --> 01:21:17,376
Really?

2438
01:21:17,377 --> 01:21:18,536
Gosh, it smells great.

2439
01:21:18,537 --> 01:21:19,847
Gosh, they look delicious.

2440
01:21:20,807 --> 01:21:21,877
Can we choose what to get?

2441
01:21:22,047 --> 01:21:24,146
No. Move down.

2442
01:21:24,147 --> 01:21:25,147
- I see.
- What?

2443
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:27,446
We have to move down without getting anything.

2444
01:21:27,447 --> 01:21:28,617
Hello.

2445
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:30,756
Look at the view.

2446
01:21:30,757 --> 01:21:32,687
- How nice.
- This place has a great view.

2447
01:21:32,957 --> 01:21:35,456
The view is wide open,

2448
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:36,727
and the weather is nice.

2449
01:21:37,097 --> 01:21:38,627
What a fair view.

2450
01:21:39,297 --> 01:21:43,367
(A place where you can appreciate the breathtaking view with the sky)

2451
01:21:44,397 --> 01:21:47,306
(An exhilarating flight amidst nature)

2452
01:21:47,307 --> 01:21:50,907
(Paragliding)

2453
01:21:51,507 --> 01:21:54,577
(A place where you can enjoy the view with bread and coffee)

2454
01:21:55,007 --> 01:21:59,417
(The members are at the cafe next to the paragliding center.)

2455
01:21:59,917 --> 01:22:02,016
Okay. I get it. We're going to see Sae Ho fly.

2456
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:04,116
- We're not paragliding.
- I hope you're right. Please.

2457
01:22:04,117 --> 01:22:05,416
I hope that's the case.

2458
01:22:05,417 --> 01:22:06,786
We're going to watch Sae Ho jump off.

2459
01:22:06,787 --> 01:22:08,256
We're not doing it.

2460
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,056
- Is Sae Ho jumping off here?
- I hope that's the case.

2461
01:22:10,057 --> 01:22:11,427
We're not paragliding.

2462
01:22:11,997 --> 01:22:14,126
What? Sae Ho is here.

2463
01:22:14,127 --> 01:22:15,167
What?

2464
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:18,267
(Cho Sae Ho, whom they have been waiting for, shows up.)

2465
01:22:18,537 --> 01:22:20,206
(You're here, my friend.)

2466
01:22:20,207 --> 01:22:21,437
Are you an instructor?

2467
01:22:21,707 --> 01:22:23,237
Are you an instructor?

2468
01:22:23,537 --> 01:22:24,537
- What?
- Sae Ho.

2469
01:22:24,538 --> 01:22:25,677
I'm really nervous.

2470
01:22:25,837 --> 01:22:26,906
You haven't tried it yet?

2471
01:22:26,907 --> 01:22:30,677
(20 minutes ago)

2472
01:22:36,287 --> 01:22:39,687
(Sae Ho arrives alone at the destination.)

2473
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:42,827
(Laughing)

2474
01:22:43,057 --> 01:22:44,057
Congratulations.

2475
01:22:44,058 --> 01:22:46,027
Sae Ho, who loves heights more than anyone else.

2476
01:22:46,527 --> 01:22:49,167
You won a paragliding experience, one of the best ways...

2477
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:51,936
to fully enjoy the seasonal scenery.

2478
01:22:51,937 --> 01:22:53,667
(He won a paragliding experience.)

2479
01:22:54,207 --> 01:22:56,837
(A special, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity)

2480
01:22:57,607 --> 01:22:59,007
I opened my eyes, and I was here.

2481
01:22:59,777 --> 01:23:01,547
(Feeling dizzy)

2482
01:23:01,677 --> 01:23:03,917
My goodness. I'm paragliding here.

2483
01:23:04,277 --> 01:23:08,147
(This is where Sae Ho will be paragliding.)

2484
01:23:08,687 --> 01:23:10,616
- Hello.
- Hello.

2485
01:23:10,617 --> 01:23:12,756
- Nice to meet you. I'm Cho Sae Ho.
- Hello.

2486
01:23:12,757 --> 01:23:14,156
I'm Son Gi Hun,

2487
01:23:14,157 --> 01:23:15,356
a paragliding pilot.

2488
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:17,197
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

2489
01:23:17,827 --> 01:23:20,227
You're here on a good day when the weather is nice.

2490
01:23:21,027 --> 01:23:22,626
- I'm happy.
- It will be a fun ride.

2491
01:23:22,627 --> 01:23:24,766
I've become a bit timid.

2492
01:23:24,767 --> 01:23:26,906
- I understand how you feel.
- Yes.

2493
01:23:26,907 --> 01:23:29,036
If you don't mind, can you give me a hug?

2494
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:30,107
Sure.

2495
01:23:30,877 --> 01:23:31,937
Thank you.

2496
01:23:33,847 --> 01:23:34,907
Give me a hug.

2497
01:23:35,007 --> 01:23:36,146
- I'll be going.
- What?

2498
01:23:36,147 --> 01:23:37,316
- Be careful.
- Okay.

2499
01:23:37,317 --> 01:23:38,317
- See you.
- Sae Ho.

2500
01:23:38,318 --> 01:23:39,958
- Make sure to stretch your legs.
- Okay.

2501
01:23:40,047 --> 01:23:41,087
What are you doing?

2502
01:23:41,347 --> 01:23:42,917
The gun is like...

2503
01:23:43,017 --> 01:23:44,617
- I'll see you later.
- Sae Ho.

2504
01:23:44,657 --> 01:23:46,356
- Yes?
- We will film you paragliding.

2505
01:23:46,357 --> 01:23:47,386
Okay.

2506
01:23:47,387 --> 01:23:48,426
(Sae Ho leaves to prepare for the paragliding.)

2507
01:23:48,427 --> 01:23:49,896
We're not doing this.

2508
01:23:49,897 --> 01:23:51,627
- What do we do then?
- What about us?

2509
01:23:52,397 --> 01:23:55,367
You guys will watch Sae Ho experience paragliding.

2510
01:23:55,567 --> 01:23:57,436
(Happy)

2511
01:23:57,437 --> 01:23:58,596
I suddenly feel happy.

2512
01:23:58,597 --> 01:24:00,206
The weather is great today.

2513
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:01,336
- I know.
- Yes.

2514
01:24:01,337 --> 01:24:03,907
I'm sad. I thought I was going to try it myself.

2515
01:24:04,277 --> 01:24:05,277
Do you want to go paragliding?

2516
01:24:05,278 --> 01:24:07,507
I have no fear at all.

2517
01:24:07,647 --> 01:24:09,746
- Are you sad?
- I'm really sad.

2518
01:24:09,747 --> 01:24:12,246
I even tried skydiving before. This is no big deal.

2519
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:14,287
You should talk to them then.

2520
01:24:14,317 --> 01:24:16,987
But we have certain rules here.

2521
01:24:17,457 --> 01:24:18,457
I can't do that.

2522
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:20,427
I'm so nervous.

2523
01:24:22,387 --> 01:24:23,896
Sae Ho, I'll see you later.

2524
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:24,956
(Sae Ho stands at the takeoff site after getting ready.)

2525
01:24:24,957 --> 01:24:26,456
- Sae Ho!
- Are you ready?

2526
01:24:26,457 --> 01:24:28,267
How high is this place?

2527
01:24:28,967 --> 01:24:31,736
This is the same height as the L Tower.

2528
01:24:31,737 --> 01:24:33,306
- It's 555m.
- I see.

2529
01:24:33,307 --> 01:24:35,136
It's like you are jumping off the L Tower.

2530
01:24:35,137 --> 01:24:38,177
(It's like he's jumping from here.)

2531
01:24:41,347 --> 01:24:44,317
(Calm down, my heart.)

2532
01:24:44,877 --> 01:24:48,217
(He feels more nervous after hearing the height.)

2533
01:24:48,787 --> 01:24:49,847
Sae Ho!

2534
01:24:50,657 --> 01:24:52,487
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

2535
01:24:52,717 --> 01:24:54,387
There's one person left.

2536
01:24:55,127 --> 01:24:56,527
Are they jumping together?

2537
01:24:56,627 --> 01:24:58,527
What? Is that Dong Hoon?

2538
01:24:58,597 --> 01:24:59,826
- What? That's Dong Hoon.
- What?

2539
01:24:59,827 --> 01:25:00,866
- Dong Hoon?
- What...

2540
01:25:00,867 --> 01:25:01,926
(Sae Ho's cameraman is ready to jump together.)

2541
01:25:01,927 --> 01:25:03,843
- Is that Dong Hoon?
- They are jumping together.

2542
01:25:03,867 --> 01:25:05,196
(Dong Hoon's camera)

2543
01:25:05,197 --> 01:25:07,537
- Hey, bro!
- Is he jumping?

2544
01:25:07,707 --> 01:25:09,336
They're jumping together.

2545
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:11,153
(He's a professional who still films even at this moment.)

2546
01:25:11,177 --> 01:25:13,076
There's nothing Dong Hoon can't do.

2547
01:25:13,077 --> 01:25:14,197
He will take close-up shots.

2548
01:25:14,307 --> 01:25:17,747
Wave at the camera.

2549
01:25:17,977 --> 01:25:19,576
What's your name?

2550
01:25:19,577 --> 01:25:20,846
Cho Sae Ho.

2551
01:25:20,847 --> 01:25:22,086
Nice to meet you.

2552
01:25:22,087 --> 01:25:24,256
Nice to meet you. Let's do this!

2553
01:25:24,257 --> 01:25:26,656
Members, please cheer for him.

2554
01:25:26,657 --> 01:25:29,186
- Wish me luck!
- Good luck!

2555
01:25:29,187 --> 01:25:31,396
(You can do this, Cho Sae Ho!)

2556
01:25:31,397 --> 01:25:33,027
Please fly high into the sky!

2557
01:25:34,367 --> 01:25:37,367
I will do a final check.

2558
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:41,066
Helmet. Shoulder straps. There's no problem.

2559
01:25:41,067 --> 01:25:45,007
You're properly connected to the pilot.

2560
01:25:45,137 --> 01:25:46,946
- Are you confident?
- Yes!

2561
01:25:46,947 --> 01:25:47,947
All right.

2562
01:25:49,747 --> 01:25:51,217
Let's go, Sae Ho!

2563
01:25:53,887 --> 01:25:57,217
(He looks nervous when it's time to jump.)

2564
01:25:57,617 --> 01:25:59,257
Do you have anyone you love?

2565
01:25:59,957 --> 01:26:01,587
- My wife.
- What about your mom?

2566
01:26:02,087 --> 01:26:03,887
- What about your mom?
- What about your mom?

2567
01:26:04,127 --> 01:26:05,597
Let's have an interview.

2568
01:26:05,757 --> 01:26:07,766
- What about your mom?
- I love my mom too.

2569
01:26:07,767 --> 01:26:08,873
(The undutiful son forgot his mother overcome with anxiety.)

2570
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:11,666
Your mom is 70 now. You're so mean.

2571
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,237
I love my family.

2572
01:26:14,567 --> 01:26:17,076
(Thanks to the members, he's eased up a bit.)

2573
01:26:17,077 --> 01:26:18,136
The interview.

2574
01:26:18,137 --> 01:26:19,706
Okay. We will get going now.

2575
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:20,776
Okay.

2576
01:26:20,777 --> 01:26:21,847
(Ready to take off)

2577
01:26:21,877 --> 01:26:23,517
- He's going.
- There he goes.

2578
01:26:25,677 --> 01:26:27,446
Sae Ho, are you ready?

2579
01:26:27,447 --> 01:26:28,486
I'm ready.

2580
01:26:28,487 --> 01:26:30,086
- You have to run fast.
- Okay.

2581
01:26:30,087 --> 01:26:31,486
Ready.

2582
01:26:31,487 --> 01:26:32,686
Go, Sae Ho!

2583
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:35,026
- Go, Sae Ho!
- Go, Sae Ho!

2584
01:26:35,027 --> 01:26:36,827
One, two, three. Run!

2585
01:26:38,257 --> 01:26:40,567
One, two, three. Run!

2586
01:26:41,227 --> 01:26:42,327
Keep your legs straight.

2587
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:44,737
- Go, Sae Ho!
- Go, Sae Ho!

2588
01:26:45,237 --> 01:26:48,067
(The wings are spread against the wind.)

2589
01:26:48,637 --> 01:26:52,277
(He runs to the end with gritted teeth.)

2590
01:26:55,207 --> 01:26:56,676
Don't get scared!

2591
01:26:56,677 --> 01:26:59,016
- Until the end.
- Don't get scared!

2592
01:26:59,017 --> 01:27:01,347
- I can do this!
- Legs!

2593
01:27:02,247 --> 01:27:04,657
- I can do this!
- Legs!

2594
01:27:05,317 --> 01:27:06,387
All right.

2595
01:27:07,287 --> 01:27:10,357
(Sae Ho is flying.)

2596
01:27:11,527 --> 01:27:13,156
(Exclaiming)

2597
01:27:13,157 --> 01:27:15,296
Lean backwards.

2598
01:27:15,297 --> 01:27:16,297
He's flying.

2599
01:27:17,467 --> 01:27:19,497
(Clapping in admiration)

2600
01:27:23,437 --> 01:27:25,606
Lean backwards.

2601
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:27,106
Raise your knees.

2602
01:27:27,107 --> 01:27:28,577
Raise your knees, not legs.

2603
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:30,377
- Good.
- My goodness.

2604
01:27:30,477 --> 01:27:32,676
Give me the camera.

2605
01:27:32,677 --> 01:27:34,687
Hold this.

2606
01:27:34,817 --> 01:27:35,817
(He finally feels relieved.)

2607
01:27:35,818 --> 01:27:37,186
Sae Ho.

2608
01:27:37,187 --> 01:27:38,856
There's a camera above your head.

2609
01:27:38,857 --> 01:27:40,286
Wave at the camera with your both hands.

2610
01:27:40,287 --> 01:27:41,657
Hello.

2611
01:27:42,027 --> 01:27:43,757
How does it feel to fly?

2612
01:27:44,057 --> 01:27:45,257
It's ecstatic.

2613
01:27:46,157 --> 01:27:47,397
- My goodness.
- All right.

2614
01:27:47,827 --> 01:27:49,766
- Isn't this great?
- It feels so cool.

2615
01:27:49,767 --> 01:27:50,897
Is it cool?

2616
01:27:51,137 --> 01:27:52,337
My gosh.

2617
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:54,737
Good.

2618
01:27:54,837 --> 01:27:58,677
Actually, this is very comfortable.

2619
01:28:00,547 --> 01:28:02,177
Dong Hoon!

2620
01:28:02,347 --> 01:28:04,176
(His cameraman is suffering together.)

2621
01:28:04,177 --> 01:28:06,346
- So, we're flying up with the wind.
- Yes.

2622
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:08,817
- We're going up higher now.
- Okay.

2623
01:28:09,647 --> 01:28:12,716
If you're nervous, you can lean back against me.

2624
01:28:12,717 --> 01:28:15,687
I'm feeling a little nervous.

2625
01:28:16,187 --> 01:28:17,556
- It's been a long time.
- Okay.

2626
01:28:17,557 --> 01:28:19,827
You can see the takeoff site on your left.

2627
01:28:20,427 --> 01:28:21,527
It looks great, right?

2628
01:28:22,967 --> 01:28:25,736
- The river you see ahead of you...
- It's beautiful.

2629
01:28:25,737 --> 01:28:27,606
Is called the Namhan River.

2630
01:28:27,607 --> 01:28:29,836
- It means a river that flows south.
- Yes.

2631
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:33,176
It meets the Bukhan River at Dumulmeori in Yangypeong...

2632
01:28:33,177 --> 01:28:35,606
and flows into the Han River.

2633
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:37,176
- We're going up.
- Isn't that great?

2634
01:28:37,177 --> 01:28:38,216
Yes.

2635
01:28:38,217 --> 01:28:40,346
- Can you feel we're going up?
- Yes.

2636
01:28:40,347 --> 01:28:41,686
(They go up with the wind without knowing Sae Ho's feeling.)

2637
01:28:41,687 --> 01:28:43,987
We will repeat ascending and descending.

2638
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:46,286
(He's scared when he looks down.)

2639
01:28:46,287 --> 01:28:47,527
What did you say?

2640
01:28:47,727 --> 01:28:50,056
- Say hello.
- Hi.

2641
01:28:50,057 --> 01:28:52,227
(When he looks ahead, a spectacular view unfolds.)

2642
01:28:53,767 --> 01:28:56,766
(He's flying through the fall in season.)

2643
01:28:56,767 --> 01:28:58,096
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes.

2644
01:28:58,097 --> 01:28:59,397
Good.

2645
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:02,366
Do you see the mountain cut off on your right?

2646
01:29:02,367 --> 01:29:04,107
- Yes.
- The mountain is...

2647
01:29:04,307 --> 01:29:06,977
in Danyang, where Korea's largest cement company is located.

2648
01:29:07,377 --> 01:29:09,647
It's a mine where limestone is mined for cement.

2649
01:29:11,217 --> 01:29:13,316
- There we go.
- Where are we going?

2650
01:29:13,317 --> 01:29:15,086
- There we go.
- Where are we going?

2651
01:29:15,087 --> 01:29:16,286
(A steep descent)

2652
01:29:16,287 --> 01:29:17,816
It feels weightless, right?

2653
01:29:17,817 --> 01:29:18,817
(A surprise zero-gravity experience)

2654
01:29:18,818 --> 01:29:20,256
- Yes.
- Make yourself comfortable.

2655
01:29:20,257 --> 01:29:21,787
- Are we going down now?
- Yes.

2656
01:29:21,957 --> 01:29:24,396
We're going down gently.

2657
01:29:24,397 --> 01:29:26,097
(It comes with a direct descent.)

2658
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:27,767
(Surprised)

2659
01:29:28,267 --> 01:29:29,826
(Exclaiming)

2660
01:29:29,827 --> 01:29:31,737
(His expression hardens.)

2661
01:29:32,267 --> 01:29:35,067
All right. Spread your arms.

2662
01:29:35,367 --> 01:29:36,537
Stretch your legs.

2663
01:29:36,707 --> 01:29:38,976
Scream at the camera!

2664
01:29:38,977 --> 01:29:41,476
- My gosh! Watch what you say!
- Good.

2665
01:29:41,477 --> 01:29:42,707
Good.

2666
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:47,047
(Watch what you say?)

2667
01:29:47,347 --> 01:29:51,887
(Sae Ho suddenly tells people to watch what they say.)

2668
01:29:52,617 --> 01:29:56,257
(And the five survivors are watching him from afar.)

2669
01:29:56,827 --> 01:29:58,796
(They don't know their fate.)

2670
01:29:58,797 --> 01:30:00,427
Call Sae Ho and ask him if he's okay.

2671
01:30:01,227 --> 01:30:02,227
Can he pick up the phone?

2672
01:30:03,227 --> 01:30:06,937
(3 minutes before Sae Ho's takeoff)

2673
01:30:07,107 --> 01:30:08,667
- Once you take off, - Yes.

2674
01:30:08,807 --> 01:30:10,166
We will select additional members.

2675
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:11,177
Really?

2676
01:30:11,607 --> 01:30:13,336
- So...
- Seriously?

2677
01:30:13,337 --> 01:30:14,823
(Misfortune is best when it's shared.)

2678
01:30:14,847 --> 01:30:17,016
Can you tell me what the mission is?

2679
01:30:17,017 --> 01:30:19,046
Then I'll be happy while flying.

2680
01:30:19,047 --> 01:30:20,946
Among the members,

2681
01:30:20,947 --> 01:30:24,857
the ones who say, "I want to give it a try!"

2682
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:26,187
I see.

2683
01:30:26,357 --> 01:30:27,526
The one who says things...

2684
01:30:27,527 --> 01:30:28,656
- they don't even mean.
- Yes.

2685
01:30:28,657 --> 01:30:31,257
(One member who bluffs with empty words will go paragliding.)

2686
01:30:32,097 --> 01:30:36,127
(A secret hint for the mission prepared by the production crew)

2687
01:30:36,567 --> 01:30:37,636
(Watch what you say.)

2688
01:30:37,637 --> 01:30:39,997
(They put the sticker at the entrance of the cafe.)

2689
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:42,348
When you take off, the moment your feet leave the ground,

2690
01:30:42,467 --> 01:30:45,406
you should say "Watch what you say!"

2691
01:30:45,407 --> 01:30:46,506
- Shout it once.
- Okay.

2692
01:30:46,507 --> 01:30:48,246
You don't have to sound too nice.

2693
01:30:48,247 --> 01:30:49,976
It doesn't matter even if they can't hear you.

2694
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:51,247
- Just shout loudly?
- Yes.

2695
01:30:51,977 --> 01:30:55,087
(Taking off)

2696
01:30:55,217 --> 01:30:58,217
(Little lambs who know nothing)

2697
01:30:58,417 --> 01:30:59,786
Now.

2698
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:00,856
(Watch what you say.)

2699
01:31:00,857 --> 01:31:02,357
Legs.

2700
01:31:03,827 --> 01:31:04,896
(Watch what you say.)

2701
01:31:04,897 --> 01:31:06,256
Legs.

2702
01:31:06,257 --> 01:31:09,097
(The hidden mission starts.)

2703
01:31:10,897 --> 01:31:13,036
(Director Joo is watching them closely.)

2704
01:31:13,037 --> 01:31:14,666
Dong Hoon.

2705
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:18,206
(The cameramen of the show should go paragliding with the members.)

2706
01:31:18,207 --> 01:31:19,537
Go!

2707
01:31:20,477 --> 01:31:22,006
No. I'm so scared.

2708
01:31:22,007 --> 01:31:23,176
He's sitting well.

2709
01:31:23,177 --> 01:31:24,877
(Exclaiming)

2710
01:31:25,047 --> 01:31:26,176
(The folded wing is a normal phenomenon.)

2711
01:31:26,177 --> 01:31:28,387
The wing is folded.

2712
01:31:28,847 --> 01:31:30,586
Dong Hoon's wing is folded.

2713
01:31:30,587 --> 01:31:32,087
(So far, they speak out of fear.)

2714
01:31:32,257 --> 01:31:33,887
Dong Hoon's really something.

2715
01:31:35,027 --> 01:31:36,386
Why is he taking such risks?

2716
01:31:36,387 --> 01:31:37,673
(They worry about the cameraman.)

2717
01:31:37,697 --> 01:31:41,227
(Lucky Jong Min's quiet because he's taking a video.)

2718
01:31:41,297 --> 01:31:42,967
Call Sae Ho and ask if he's okay.

2719
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:45,896
- Can he pick up the phone?
- That's incredible.

2720
01:31:45,897 --> 01:31:47,137
I'm jealous.

2721
01:31:47,807 --> 01:31:48,936
(Someone's on the radar!)

2722
01:31:48,937 --> 01:31:51,137
- That's the scary part.
- Look at the turn.

2723
01:31:51,377 --> 01:31:52,936
Sae Ho's going down really fast.

2724
01:31:52,937 --> 01:31:54,947
(Will Joon bluff again?)

2725
01:31:55,577 --> 01:31:56,847
Gosh.

2726
01:31:58,077 --> 01:31:59,717
That looks like fun.

2727
01:32:00,147 --> 01:32:03,117
(We got you.)

2728
01:32:03,387 --> 01:32:07,457
(That looks like fun!)

2729
01:32:07,657 --> 01:32:08,687
Do you want a go?

2730
01:32:09,027 --> 01:32:10,996
I don't feel a thing.

2731
01:32:10,997 --> 01:32:12,027
Do you want a go?

2732
01:32:12,397 --> 01:32:15,126
I won't because we're filming a show.

2733
01:32:15,127 --> 01:32:16,767
(He even proves he doesn't mean it.)

2734
01:32:17,537 --> 01:32:18,697
What if you could have a go?

2735
01:32:19,897 --> 01:32:21,267
Then I'd do it.

2736
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:23,036
Your drinks are here.

2737
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:24,837
(We'll let you shortly.)

2738
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:28,476
We usually play a game to win refreshments.

2739
01:32:28,477 --> 01:32:29,746
This is my second time.

2740
01:32:29,747 --> 01:32:30,817
We played a game.

2741
01:32:31,677 --> 01:32:32,976
Something we can't see.

2742
01:32:32,977 --> 01:32:35,016
It's the second time we got something for nothing.

2743
01:32:35,017 --> 01:32:36,486
I wrote it all down.

2744
01:32:36,487 --> 01:32:38,486
- Hey, this tastes good.
- It's the second time.

2745
01:32:38,487 --> 01:32:40,086
You all took a sip, didn't you?

2746
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:41,087
- Yes.
- Yes.

2747
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,857
Okay. Lee Joon.

2748
01:32:43,687 --> 01:32:45,027
Congratulations.

2749
01:32:45,427 --> 01:32:46,527
- What for?
- What?

2750
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:47,927
What's going on?

2751
01:32:48,627 --> 01:32:51,737
- What's this about?
- What's happening?

2752
01:32:52,267 --> 01:32:53,436
Was he the first to drink?

2753
01:32:53,437 --> 01:32:55,707
(Let's celebrate first.)

2754
01:32:55,967 --> 01:32:57,177
What's this about?

2755
01:32:57,437 --> 01:32:59,977
(What's going on?)

2756
01:33:00,237 --> 01:33:02,207
(Next episode)

2757
01:33:02,477 --> 01:33:04,316
(It's the season...)

2758
01:33:04,317 --> 01:33:06,677
(of Jecheon)

2759
01:33:07,077 --> 01:33:08,917
(Win the autumn set meal.)

2760
01:33:09,487 --> 01:33:10,857
(It's fantastic.)

2761
01:33:10,957 --> 01:33:12,157
(Screaming)

2762
01:33:12,757 --> 01:33:14,827
(No one can get this!)

2763
01:33:15,127 --> 01:33:16,887
(In 2 Days 1 Night's history, )

2764
01:33:17,397 --> 01:33:19,857
(this is the hardest random game.)

2765
01:33:19,997 --> 01:33:21,527
(No one knows!)

2766
01:33:22,127 --> 01:33:23,697
(Tears erupt.)

2767
01:33:23,997 --> 01:33:25,997
(To win a seasonal set meal)

2768
01:33:26,567 --> 01:33:28,667
(A tearjerker of a fight)

2769
01:33:29,037 --> 01:33:31,537
(How many dishes can they keep?)

2770
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:33,529
(See you next week.)
