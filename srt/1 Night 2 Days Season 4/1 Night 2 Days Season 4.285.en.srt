1
00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:04,127
(A strange rumor began in faraway Jeju.)

2
00:00:04,397 --> 00:00:07,137
("Team up with Joon and you definitely lose.")

3
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,206
(A Defeat Fairy Pageant is held...)

4
00:00:09,207 --> 00:00:10,707
(to find the true Defeat Fairy.)

5
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:12,706
(As if to prove the rumor, )

6
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:14,137
(Joon's team lost.)

7
00:00:14,377 --> 00:00:16,337
(In the next game that their lunch depended on, )

8
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:18,023
(Joon's remarkable participation...)

9
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:19,517
(caused his team to lose again.)

10
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:21,877
(In the lunchtime relief mission, )

11
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:23,387
(only Joon lost.)

12
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:25,797
(We thought he'd become the Defeat Fairy.)

13
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:30,687
(It's Muscle Joon time.)

14
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:36,897
(He showed off various techniques.)

15
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:41,597
(Joon wins at last!)

16
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:46,477
(Defeat Fairy final: Se Yoon versus Joon)

17
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,847
(The last chance to avoid becoming the Defeat Fairy)

18
00:00:50,577 --> 00:00:53,917
(After a competition that was fierce until the end, )

19
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:56,017
(Lee Joon won.)

20
00:00:56,647 --> 00:00:59,557
(Se Yoon is the official Defeat Fairy.)

21
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:01,857
(Overwhelmed)

22
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:04,526
(How will the Gangneung trip...)

23
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:06,597
(with Defeat Fairy Se Yoon go?)

24
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:09,766
(2 Days 1 Night)

25
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:11,396
(Defeat Fairy)

26
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:12,566
I'm hungry now.

27
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,737
- Yes, me too.
- Very hungry.

28
00:01:14,997 --> 00:01:17,566
- You had a long, hard day.
- Yes.

29
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:20,136
Since Boknal is coming up,

30
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:21,306
to boost your energy...

31
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:22,607
No way. I must eat this.

32
00:01:22,777 --> 00:01:25,217
- The dinner we prepared...
- Sarcodon mushroom chicken soup.

33
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:26,847
Is an invigorating set meal.

34
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:29,147
- I really need to eat.
- We...

35
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,186
- We sweated so much.
- Please.

36
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:32,686
- I've been exhausted.
- Yes.

37
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:34,186
We'll bring it in for you.

38
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:35,187
Come on!

39
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:38,057
If they're bringing it in, they'll take things away 1 by 1.

40
00:01:38,427 --> 00:01:39,757
They give and take away.

41
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:42,096
- This is...
- We drool, and...

42
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:43,396
(Jong Min goes out to welcome the meal.)

43
00:01:43,397 --> 00:01:44,527
Sit back down.

44
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:46,496
- Why are you over there?
- You said...

45
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:47,566
the watermelon filled you up.

46
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:49,066
You're always like this.

47
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,236
(His hunger took over.)

48
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:51,266
Come on in.

49
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:52,336
(They wait eagerly.)

50
00:01:52,337 --> 00:01:53,707
- This is madness.
- Gosh.

51
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:56,176
This is just crazy.

52
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:59,346
A typical invigorating dish for the summer, braised oxtails.

53
00:01:59,347 --> 00:02:00,916
(Braised oxtails)

54
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:01,947
Fried eel.

55
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:03,617
Grilled pine mushrooms.

56
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:06,186
A specialty of Gangneung,

57
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:08,056
- spicy floating goby stew.
- Floating goby.

58
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:09,426
- And squid sundae.
- What's "floating goby?"

59
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:10,457
(Squid sundae)

60
00:02:11,457 --> 00:02:13,526
- There's a lot to eat.
- We must eat this.

61
00:02:13,527 --> 00:02:15,326
The braised oxtail looks serious.

62
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:16,696
- I'm salivating.
- It's serious.

63
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:18,466
- Floating goby?
- This looks incredible.

64
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:19,496
(I must eat.)

65
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:21,566
- I'm hungry.
- I'm desperate.

66
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,507
- We're so tanned.
- I'm serious about this.

67
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:25,807
The Dinner Game for...

68
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:28,437
- the invigorating set meal is...
- I'm so hungry.

69
00:02:28,837 --> 00:02:30,477
- You...
- Darn it.

70
00:02:31,247 --> 00:02:33,216
You Don't Know Me.

71
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:34,316
(It's "You Don't Know Me.")

72
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:36,146
- Was that the dance?
- You Don't Know Me.

73
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:37,307
(Director Joo's sudden dance)

74
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:40,087
- Dance with more rhythm.
- I'm sorry.

75
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:42,887
It's a group mission with six rounds.

76
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:44,486
After each question,

77
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:47,796
you must guess what a certain member will decide.

78
00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:48,856
This is fun.

79
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:50,897
You each get a bowl of rice.

80
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:53,166
Each time you guess wrong,

81
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:55,166
we'll take away one main dish.

82
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,407
(They lose dish by dish)

83
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:58,807
- Who goes first?
- Okay.

84
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:00,606
Moon Se Yoon, please leave.

85
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:01,776
- Okay.
- Good luck, Se Yoon.

86
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:02,777
Okay.

87
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:06,007
You know how much I dislike standing out.

88
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:07,316
Nothing abrupt,

89
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:08,476
- and always...
- I know you.

90
00:03:08,477 --> 00:03:09,946
- follow common sense.
- I know you well.

91
00:03:09,947 --> 00:03:11,716
Se Yoon. We know you.

92
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:12,786
We go back.

93
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:13,856
- We know you.
- We go back.

94
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:15,556
We just need two dishes.

95
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:16,726
- Yes.
- Let's go!

96
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:18,427
- That's right.
- Now let's go.

97
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,697
Okay.

98
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:22,897
(They must guess Se Yoon's choice.)

99
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,566
Here's the question.

100
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,337
(Here's the first question.)

101
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,067
Ask away.

102
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:30,507
What is it?

103
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:38,077
When Se Yoon who can't eat without kimchi comes back inside,

104
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:41,076
we'll play Would You Rather.

105
00:03:41,077 --> 00:03:42,647
(Would You Rather)

106
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,007
Would you rather eat a meal without kimchi,

107
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,556
or would you rather eat kimchi without a meal?

108
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:48,586
- That's easy.
- Hey.

109
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:49,667
- This is...
- What will...

110
00:03:50,057 --> 00:03:51,257
Se Yoon say?

111
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:55,557
What is this place?

112
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:57,726
What are you doing?

113
00:03:57,727 --> 00:03:59,797
(They confront each other for no reason.)

114
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:01,937
Eating a meal without kimchi...

115
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,566
versus eating kimchi without a meal.

116
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:04,637
Se Yoon will say,

117
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:07,836
"Kimchi is the best side dish."

118
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:09,507
- That's right.
- "There is..."

119
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:11,176
"no kimchi without a meal."

120
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:12,606
- That's correct.
- That's what I thought.

121
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:14,216
It's hard to eat kimchi without a meal.

122
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:15,476
Yes. It's nonsense.

123
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:16,486
But...

124
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:17,646
- Basically, - It's Se Yoon.

125
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,216
If there are carbs,

126
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,356
- eating just that...
- Yes.

127
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:22,686
You can't eat kimchi on its own.

128
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:24,086
Let's generalize.

129
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:25,256
He loves kimchi too much.

130
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:26,996
- Even so.
- He does love kimchi.

131
00:04:26,997 --> 00:04:28,677
Can you eat raw marinated crab on its own?

132
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:31,097
I hope they don't get tricky.

133
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:33,436
They'll take the kimchi out first.

134
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:35,837
I think kimchi is 1 of the top 3 choices.

135
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:37,267
You want the kimchi?

136
00:04:37,707 --> 00:04:39,777
Most definitely. Of the dishes there...

137
00:04:40,077 --> 00:04:41,406
He likes kimchi so much.

138
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:44,206
I actually think he'll pick kimchi.

139
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:45,306
- I think...
- But...

140
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:47,146
- It's nonsense.
- Let's consider this.

141
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:48,976
As he left, he said he dislikes to stand out.

142
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:50,187
"Follow common sense."

143
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:51,787
You know...

144
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:56,357
(Se Yoon told them to avoid standing out.)

145
00:04:56,657 --> 00:04:58,957
Generally speaking, people would choose rice.

146
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:00,956
- Not kimchi on its own.
- Right.

147
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:02,356
- Let's go with that.
- One hundred percent.

148
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:03,396
We got the braised oxtail.

149
00:05:03,397 --> 00:05:05,226
- Come on in.
- Okay.

150
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:06,496
- We're 100 percent sure.
- Okay.

151
00:05:06,497 --> 00:05:07,896
- Our answer is...
- It's the rice.

152
00:05:07,897 --> 00:05:09,166
We're 100 percent sure. This is way too easy.

153
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,167
- He'll choose rice for sure.
- We'll use our fingers.

154
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,167
One, two, three.

155
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:12,167
- Number one.
- It has to be the rice.

156
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:14,037
- Eat rice without kimchi.
- Okay.

157
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:15,606
- What?
- You can go back inside.

158
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,007
- You want me to go back in?
- Yes.

159
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:21,446
I see. The question wasn't for me. They must've made a decision inside.

160
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,146
Well, you'll find out once you go inside.

161
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:24,887
Is it about how I enter? Is that it?

162
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:27,477
Like which foot I enter with? Right or left?

163
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:30,926
(His guess is completely off.)

164
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:32,456
Why don't you enter with both of your feet then?

165
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,697
(Why don't you jump inside?)

166
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:34,956
You can jump in.

167
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:36,766
I'll do that if you tell me that's not the game.

168
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:37,767
(Trying to confuse him)

169
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:39,166
I'll pluck all of your hair.

170
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,596
(Se Yoon has gotten the wrong idea.)

171
00:05:40,597 --> 00:05:41,597
Okay.

172
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:43,367
- All right. Face forward now.
- Okay.

173
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:50,307
(The moment of the decision is nearing.)

174
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:56,216
Se Yoon, don't look at them.

175
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:57,617
Just fix your eyes on me and enter.

176
00:05:59,347 --> 00:06:01,656
(He's trying to figure out which foot to enter with.)

177
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:02,786
Sae Ho, keep facing forward.

178
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:03,856
- Se Yoon, we're confident.
- Right.

179
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:04,886
Just come in comfortably.

180
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:06,157
Yes. Just relax.

181
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:07,356
It's okay.

182
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:08,426
- All right.
- This isn't the vibe I anticipated.

183
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:10,107
It wasn't about which foot I entered with?

184
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:12,527
It's Would You Rather.

185
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:14,567
Fix your eyes on me.

186
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:17,967
Would you rather eat rice without kimchi?

187
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,837
Or would you rather eat kimchi without rice?

188
00:06:21,237 --> 00:06:22,436
Hold on. Let me think about it for a second.

189
00:06:22,437 --> 00:06:23,907
Eat rice without kimchi?

190
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,277
Or just eat kimchi?

191
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:26,777
Eat kimchi without rice.

192
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:29,116
- So pick between rice and kimchi?
- Yes.

193
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:30,516
(What will Se Yoon decide?)

194
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:33,186
(Eat rice without kimchi versus eat kimchi without rice)

195
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:35,857
(His team chose eating rice without kimchi.)

196
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:39,857
(What will Se Yoon decide?)

197
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:41,627
Eat kimchi without rice.

198
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:44,226
- See?
- I told you.

199
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:46,167
You wanted the normal option.

200
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:47,797
Eat kimchi without rice.

201
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:50,236
- See?
- I told you.

202
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:51,866
You wanted the normal option.

203
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:53,676
Any normal person would eat rice,

204
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:54,936
- not kimchi.
- But...

205
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:56,646
- I told you he'd pick kimchi.
- Hey.

206
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:57,777
- Here's why.
- What...

207
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:01,276
Have they gone mad?

208
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:03,646
- Here's why. Se Yoon...
- Se Yoon loves kimchi.

209
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:05,816
- I'd always pick kimchi.
- I mean...

210
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:07,586
Then you'd rather eat kimchi without any rice?

211
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:08,617
Of course!

212
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:10,626
If I had to pick only one, I'd eat kimchi.

213
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:11,926
But you won't get full.

214
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:13,356
I can keep eating it until I feel full.

215
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:15,596
I can wash it and eat it. Or I can just bite it.

216
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:16,696
- I can also stir-fry it.
- What...

217
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:18,196
We can't think about what an average person would do.

218
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:19,266
- Right.
- We must think...

219
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:21,166
- what's normal for the member.
- The normal thing for Se Yoon.

220
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,336
We'll remove the kimchi.

221
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:23,366
No.

222
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:24,736
- We'll remove the kimchi.
- No.

223
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:25,766
- We'll remove the kimchi.
- No way.

224
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,176
- Remove the pine mushrooms.
- What? No way.

225
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:29,113
- The pine mushrooms?
- We must remove the kimchi.

226
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:30,946
- He's unbelievable.
- Have a meal without kimchi.

227
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:32,106
What's wrong with you today?

228
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:33,446
Have a meal without kimchi.

229
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:35,146
(Kimchi is eliminated.)

230
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:36,386
- We still have soup. We're good.
- Okay.

231
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:37,946
- Okay.
- We still have the spicy soup.

232
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:39,316
- Yes.
- Let's reverse Joon's answer.

233
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:40,716
(The 2nd request)

234
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:41,886
Let's consider that.

235
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:43,757
Listen up. The next question will involve...

236
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:45,826
- Sae Ho.
- Okay.

237
00:07:45,827 --> 00:07:47,027
- Please leave.
- Go.

238
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:48,856
Don't try to normalize the answer. Just do what you want.

239
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:49,896
- We'll guess your decision.
- Sae Ho.

240
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:51,166
- Don't say anything.
- Then...

241
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,766
if I had the same question, I would've chosen the rice.

242
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:53,996
- You get it, right?
- Yes.

243
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:55,767
But Sae Ho is hard to figure out.

244
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,667
Sae Ho sometimes has eccentric thoughts.

245
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,348
I hear you're not going to give me any questions outside.

246
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:03,206
- All right.
- Okay.

247
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:04,276
(Round 2 begins.)

248
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:05,447
Here's the question.

249
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:07,717
Outside...

250
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:12,317
is the most talkative member of our show, Sae Ho.

251
00:08:14,357 --> 00:08:16,056
Could you stay quiet for a moment?

252
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:17,257
That's what we said to Sae Ho.

253
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:19,427
For how many seconds...

254
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:22,926
will Sae Ho stay quiet?

255
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,503
- What? This is...
- Do you have the result now?

256
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:26,096
I knew it. I'm glad we got rid of the kimchi.

257
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:27,136
We're in trouble.

258
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,367
All right. Number 1, under 3 seconds.

259
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:31,937
Number 2, from 3 seconds to 10 seconds.

260
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,507
Number 3, from 10 seconds to 20 seconds.

261
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:36,377
Number 4, 20 seconds or longer.

262
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,453
- Until he makes a sound?
- I bet this happened for sure.

263
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,453
When the director said, "Be quiet," he would've said, "Why?"

264
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:42,346
- This is it. That's the quiz.
- You're right.

265
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:43,586
- You're right.
- Okay.

266
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:45,387
- What do you think, Se Yoon?
- "To do what?"

267
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:46,556
I'm 100 percent sure.

268
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:49,357
As you all know him, the answer must be number one.

269
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,556
When he heard, "Could you be quiet?"

270
00:08:50,557 --> 00:08:52,833
he would've said, "Why? What is it?" I bet he said that right away.

271
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:54,296
You know what Ho Shin is like.

272
00:08:54,297 --> 00:08:56,996
He's Mr. Smile. He kept smiling when I was with him.

273
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:58,496
So he must've said it with a smile.

274
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,043
"Could you be quiet?" I bet he said it like this.

275
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:01,167
Then do you think...

276
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:03,066
Sae Ho would do this? No way.

277
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,067
- Okay.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

278
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:06,148
- I thought Sae Ho was here.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

279
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:08,236
There's no way he stayed quiet.

280
00:09:08,237 --> 00:09:11,077
I'm a bit worried because Joon picked number one too.

281
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:12,506
(Chuckling)

282
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:13,616
- Jong Min - But this one...

283
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:15,146
Let's go with this for this round.

284
00:09:15,147 --> 00:09:17,286
- Okay.
- I'm serious. If I'm wrong again,

285
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:20,016
I won't say a word from now on.

286
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,916
This is... My gosh. This is way too easy...

287
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:23,557
- All right. We're ready.
- to be honest.

288
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:25,326
- All right. You can go inside.
- Okay.

289
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:26,847
(Director Ho Shin: You can go inside.)

290
00:09:27,757 --> 00:09:30,826
(How long did Sae Ho stay quiet?)

291
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:32,627
- Sae Ho, come on in.
- Sae Ho.

292
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:35,036
Are you allowed to look at me?

293
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:36,677
- It's okay. It doesn't matter.
- Sae Ho.

294
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:38,567
- Well...
- Sae Ho.

295
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:41,306
Did you figure out the mission?

296
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:43,306
(Did you figure out the mission?)

297
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:46,047
(There was a mission?)

298
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:47,446
It's good news if you didn't realize it.

299
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:48,946
- You didn't realize it.
- He didn't.

300
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:52,817
The director asked you to be quiet for a moment.

301
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:54,956
- Sae Ho.
- You...

302
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:56,486
- Do you remember?
- Did you stay quiet?

303
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:58,127
For how many seconds did you stay quiet?

304
00:09:58,357 --> 00:09:59,386
- Do you remember?
- Did you speak right away?

305
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:01,333
- You didn't stay quiet, right?
- Did you hold back?

306
00:10:01,357 --> 00:10:02,357
No way.

307
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:04,797
There's no way you stayed quiet.

308
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,097
No way. You're known as the chatty one.

309
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,136
- When I went out, - Yes.

310
00:10:09,137 --> 00:10:10,236
Ho Shin told me to be quiet...

311
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:11,336
- for a moment.
- Okay.

312
00:10:11,337 --> 00:10:13,106
So what did you say?

313
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:14,277
So I stayed quiet.

314
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:17,446
(He does what he's told.)

315
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:18,606
- You're obedient.
- All right.

316
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:19,846
I stayed quiet for 30 seconds.

317
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:21,417
(Round 2, fail)

318
00:10:21,777 --> 00:10:23,486
Ho Shin's acting must've been really good.

319
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:24,986
- How did he say it?
- "Could you be quiet for a moment?"

320
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:26,733
If he said it casually, I would've asked why.

321
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:29,686
(A few minutes ago)

322
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,426
Could you stay quiet for a moment?

323
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:32,427
Okay.

324
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:36,326
(You're watching a rare moment...)

325
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:41,437
(where Sae Ho isn't talking.)

326
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:44,836
He spoke after 19 seconds.

327
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:46,466
- All right.
- When you're asked to be quiet...

328
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:47,977
(When you're asked to be quiet...)

329
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:49,637
After that, I talked so much.

330
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:52,807
We got lucky with the weather today. Right?

331
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:55,077
Gosh, the clouds look beautiful.

332
00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:57,217
Yes. I prefer white rice to multi-grain rice.

333
00:10:57,617 --> 00:11:00,316
Discuss which dish you will remove from your dinner...

334
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:02,033
- and make a decision.
- It's a pity to lose mushrooms.

335
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:03,116
What do you think, Se Yoon?

336
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:05,626
- So they're wild pine mushrooms?
- Yes.

337
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:06,726
- Wild pine mushrooms.
- Let's get rid of them.

338
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:07,826
I'm sorry, but we'll let them go.

339
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:08,996
Let's follow the market prices.

340
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:11,243
- We can buy them ourselves.
- Yes. Considering the prices...

341
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:13,236
- But the squid dish...
- We can't lose any more dishes.

342
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,496
Guys, don't you think my hunches are good today?

343
00:11:15,497 --> 00:11:16,806
- Yes.
- I picked number three.

344
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:17,837
Really?

345
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,466
We should just follow your opinion, not mine.

346
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:20,536
All right. Then...

347
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:22,507
- Right. I think I can do well.
- Guys.

348
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:24,707
The next question will involve...

349
00:11:25,547 --> 00:11:26,547
Is it Seon Ho?

350
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,417
- DinDin.
- Gosh.

351
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:29,446
- We got this.
- Please leave.

352
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:30,516
Yes. DinDin is...

353
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,346
- Okay.
- I'm straightforward.

354
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:33,386
- It's me.
- You got this.

355
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:34,387
Okay.

356
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:36,416
Guys. Here's the question.

357
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:37,786
We must get it right this time.

358
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:40,257
Let's watch and observe which answer Joon picks.

359
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:42,557
Is it different this round?

360
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,266
- Look at the choices.
- What's that?

361
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:49,096
Rank them in the order of DinDin's least favorite activities.

362
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:50,136
- Gosh.
- How can we do that?

363
00:11:50,137 --> 00:11:52,237
- This is way too hard.
- It's too hard.

364
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,037
Let's read the choices first.

365
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:56,706
Climbing Mount Halla during summer...

366
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:58,507
at a record-high temperature, 37°C.

367
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:01,297
Diving into the water at a beach in Gangneung...

368
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:03,687
in winter at a record-low temperature, minus 15°C.

369
00:12:04,217 --> 00:12:05,346
- Gosh, it's cold.
- Number three.

370
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:06,986
Sleeping outdoors alone...

371
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:08,716
while the other members sleep...

372
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:10,056
in their own room at a five-star hotel.

373
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:11,127
I bet it's number two.

374
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:14,557
Number 4. Getting off work alone at 6pm on Saturday...

375
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:16,827
while the other members get off work on Friday.

376
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:21,367
You can list them in the order of your least favorite activities.

377
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:23,236
(Climbing Mount Halla during summer at a record-high temperature)

378
00:12:23,237 --> 00:12:24,336
(Diving into the water at a record-low temperature)

379
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:25,506
(Sleeping outdoors alone while the others stay at a hotel)

380
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:27,953
(Getting off work on Saturday while the others get off on Friday)

381
00:12:27,977 --> 00:12:28,977
But...

382
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:31,507
what if I hate all of them equally?

383
00:12:32,347 --> 00:12:34,317
I hate them so much that I want to break them.

384
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:36,346
(Climbing Mount Halla during summer at a record-high temperature)

385
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:37,546
(Diving into the water at a record-low temperature)

386
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:38,716
(Sleeping outdoors alone while the others stay at a hotel)

387
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,733
(Getting off work on Saturday while the others get off on Friday)

388
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:43,586
(DinDin finally ranks them after long deliberation.)

389
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:44,827
Gosh, we'll fail again.

390
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:47,957
- Gosh, this is way too hard.
- It is hard.

391
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:49,757
How come mine is so difficult?

392
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,426
Numbers 4 and 2 are iffy for me.

393
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:54,897
But my gut tells me the answer is 1, 4, 2, and 3.

394
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:56,706
- He'd hate number one the most?
- No way.

395
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:58,206
- No.
- No.

396
00:12:58,207 --> 00:12:59,527
- But...
- What's your reasoning?

397
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:01,076
DinDin hates hiking.

398
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:02,376
- It's obvious.
- Look.

399
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:03,506
Think about today. What did he say about Mount Halla?

400
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:05,187
- We said we'd pick a typical one.
- Look.

401
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:07,247
DinDin hates hiking the most.

402
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:08,447
No, it's getting off work late.

403
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,486
- He always told me that.
- Then it must be hiking.

404
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:11,807
- This isn't easy.
- It's hiking.

405
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:13,556
No. Trust me on this.

406
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:14,586
Then it must be hiking for sure.

407
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:15,687
It's number four.

408
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:18,526
(What has DinDin decided?)

409
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:20,727
- Gosh, this is way too hard.
- It is hard.

410
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:22,226
How come mine is so difficult?

411
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:23,803
(Mount Halla, ocean diving, sleeping outdoors, getting off work)

412
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:25,897
It's 4, 1, 2, and 3.

413
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:28,996
(He's correct.)

414
00:13:28,997 --> 00:13:30,466
Getting off work...

415
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:32,337
- is very important to me.
- Yes.

416
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:34,506
- He cares about getting off work.
- DinDin...

417
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:36,676
- DinDin hates hiking the most.
- It's hiking.

418
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:38,807
- Gosh, you're so off.
- All right.

419
00:13:39,147 --> 00:13:40,316
- So you think it's 4, 1, 2, and 3.
- No.

420
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:41,953
- And you think it's 1, 4, 2, and 3?
- Yes.

421
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:44,137
- Can you go with my answer?
- Okay. Let's go with it.

422
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:47,157
No matter how I look at it, I think he hates number four the most.

423
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:49,087
No. Joon. I'm sorry.

424
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:51,056
(He has already lost their trust.)

425
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:52,557
- Here's how I feel.
- Joon.

426
00:13:52,627 --> 00:13:53,856
- Jong Min, you did the right thing.
- It's...

427
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:55,026
- It was right to scold him.
- It's...

428
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:56,156
Let's go with Seon Ho's answer.

429
00:13:56,157 --> 00:13:57,866
- Okay. Let's say it on three.
- Let's do this.

430
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,143
Raise your hand if you think it's 4, 1, 2, and 3.

431
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,366
Me. I think that's the correct order.

432
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:01,796
It's the two newbies.

433
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:02,967
What about 1, 4, 2, and 3?

434
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:04,167
- Hey.
- I think that's correct.

435
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:06,288
This has to be correct. He must hate hiking the most.

436
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:07,606
That guy has a heart of steel.

437
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:09,406
- Jong Hyun. Could you...
- Yes?

438
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,847
- We're between two answers.
- Yes.

439
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:14,216
Could you tell us if one of the answers is correct?

440
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:15,946
- Knowing we have a 50-50 chance...
- Right.

441
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:17,363
Will make it more interesting for us.

442
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:18,586
- Between the two.
- The correct answer...

443
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:20,667
Is one of them the answer? Tell us even if it's not.

444
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:22,517
- is between the two answers.
- That's good.

445
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:23,986
- Hey. We got it right.
- My gosh.

446
00:14:23,987 --> 00:14:26,256
- It has to be.
- We won this round.

447
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:27,456
Then we must listen to Seon Ho.

448
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:29,333
- This has to be the answer.
- Okay. Let's go with Seon Ho's.

449
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:31,366
To say that Joon and I know DinDin well,

450
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,126
- we spent less time with him.
- Yes.

451
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:34,196
- Gosh, Seon Ho.
- We've known him for a long time.

452
00:14:34,197 --> 00:14:35,966
- Your hunches are amazing.
- Great. Let's go.

453
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:37,566
- That has to be the answer.
- Okay.

454
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,567
- Yes.
- It's 1, 4, 2, and 3.

455
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:40,007
- It's 1, 4, 2, and 3.
- Okay.

456
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:41,377
- This has to be it.
- Four...

457
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,977
I might be upset if they get it wrong.

458
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:47,046
- Please follow my lead today.
- Okay.

459
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:48,846
I often think about you guys.

460
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:49,917
Okay.

461
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:52,747
- There's no way we'd get it wrong.
- DinDin.

462
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:54,886
DinDin. Do you think we wouldn't get this right?

463
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,556
- We know you.
- DinDin.

464
00:14:56,557 --> 00:14:57,557
All right.

465
00:14:57,558 --> 00:14:59,587
We've known DinDin for years.

466
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:01,896
- DinDin.
- Yes, we got it.

467
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:02,957
(It was all me, DinDin.)

468
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:04,067
Please...

469
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:06,273
- Reveal it, DinDin.
- reveal the correct answer.

470
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:07,297
All right.

471
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:08,858
(3 seconds before revealing the answer)

472
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:10,936
DinDin! Please.

473
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:12,137
- You...
- Let's get oxtails.

474
00:15:12,337 --> 00:15:13,507
This has to be it.

475
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:16,777
- Ta-da.
- My gosh. Hey.

476
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:19,077
- My gosh. Hey.
- Gosh.

477
00:15:19,547 --> 00:15:20,547
(Hey!)

478
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:23,017
He said...

479
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:25,286
- What's wrong with him?
- You made a mistake?

480
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:26,856
- What...
- Did he...

481
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:28,816
- What is it?
- Come on!

482
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:30,426
- Hey.
- What's going on?

483
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:32,026
- That was what Joon and I said.
- It's...

484
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:33,186
- We said it was 4, 1, 2, and 3.
- Hey.

485
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:34,526
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

486
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:35,797
You hate hiking!

487
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:37,267
Why did you... Hey.

488
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:39,326
- We lost oxtails because of you.
- I told you.

489
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:40,666
- What is this? Hey.
- Come on.

490
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,096
- Let's give up the eels.
- Yes.

491
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:43,237
- Hey, eels?
- My gosh.

492
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:46,167
In retrospect, Joon is something else.

493
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:48,417
This was the first time I got a question right!

494
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:51,407
- He was about to get it right.
- But we got it wrong again.

495
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:53,347
But the other members stopped him.

496
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:56,516
I was going to get it right, but they said no.

497
00:15:56,517 --> 00:15:58,016
Joon, you're something else.

498
00:15:58,017 --> 00:16:00,417
- Gosh, we managed to miss that.
- Hey.

499
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:02,586
- I'm sure you guys can do this.
- Okay.

500
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,326
- You guys got close, right?
- So...

501
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:06,056
Let's protect those three. That's it.

502
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:07,357
- So...
- Whatever.

503
00:16:07,627 --> 00:16:09,457
This question will involve...

504
00:16:10,397 --> 00:16:11,596
- Seon Ho.
- Yes.

505
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,277
- We'll get it right, Seon Ho.
- Go ahead.

506
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:15,436
What if you feel worse when we get it right?

507
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:16,666
- Just get it right.
- Okay.

508
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,027
- Once Seon Ho goes out...
- Okay.

509
00:16:18,907 --> 00:16:20,137
Why did you do it, Seon Ho?

510
00:16:21,077 --> 00:16:22,907
Well, DinDin hates hiking.

511
00:16:23,077 --> 00:16:24,646
DinDin should hate hiking the most.

512
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:25,753
(While Seon Ho is outside...)

513
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,947
Everyone, let's begin.

514
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:30,587
Seon Ho is the weakest...

515
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:33,047
when it comes to quizzes about capital cities.

516
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:34,416
- Quizzes about what?
- Will he know...

517
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:35,417
About capital cities.

518
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:38,427
- the capital city of Austria?
- There's no way he knows this.

519
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:40,597
- There's no way he knows it.
- He doesn't. Okay.

520
00:16:40,757 --> 00:16:43,766
(For your information, Seon Ho...)

521
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:44,767
The UK.

522
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:46,996
(doesn't know the capital city of the UK.)

523
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:47,997
India.

524
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:50,637
(He thinks Indonesia is the capital city of India.)

525
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:51,806
Germany.

526
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:54,577
(He doesn't know Berlin is the capital city of Germany.)

527
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:56,206
Gosh, please.

528
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:57,207
(He's the worst at capital city quizzes.)

529
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,507
I can't even guess what it is.

530
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:01,346
- He might get it right.
- I think he might...

531
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:03,246
- because...
- Typically, would he know it?

532
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:05,286
Vienna is the first thing people say when they hear Austria.

533
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:06,846
- Typically, he wouldn't know.
- No, I wouldn't know.

534
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:08,207
- We must think of Seon Ho.
- Hey.

535
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:09,917
- All right. Let's vote.
- But...

536
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:11,526
- Seon Ho won't know the answer.
- He won't.

537
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:12,527
(3 people vote for Seon Ho not knowing the answer.)

538
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:16,626
Here's the thing. He's been studying capital cities.

539
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:18,127
No. But he won't know.

540
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,367
From what I'm observing,

541
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:21,088
- they can't come to an agreement.
- Right.

542
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:23,037
You must be curious about their discussion.

543
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:24,337
- I don't think he'll know.
- Okay.

544
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:25,536
- First of all...
- Okay.

545
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:26,906
- Let's follow the majority rule.
- He won't know the answer.

546
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:28,236
- I'll go with it since...
- He won't know.

547
00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:29,876
- they're the majority.
- This is the majority rule.

548
00:17:29,877 --> 00:17:30,947
- Okay.
- He won't know.

549
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:35,117
(Will Seon Ho know the capital city of Austria?)

550
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:36,716
(Seon Ho must get it wrong for them to secure the dish.)

551
00:17:36,717 --> 00:17:38,637
Gosh. What is it? I can't even guess what it is.

552
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:40,256
All right. Here it goes.

553
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:41,357
(Here comes the question.)

554
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:45,987
What's the capital city of Austria?

555
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:47,557
One.

556
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:49,038
(What's the capital city of Austria?)

557
00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:51,366
(Get it wrong, Seon Ho.)

558
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:52,367
Two.

559
00:17:53,297 --> 00:17:54,696
(What's Seon Ho's answer?)

560
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:55,697
Three.

561
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:58,733
What's the capital city of Austria?

562
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:00,372
One.

563
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:01,853
(What's the capital city of Austria?)

564
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:03,642
(Get it wrong, Seon Ho.)

565
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:04,673
Two.

566
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:07,012
(What's Seon Ho's answer?)

567
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:08,043
Three.

568
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,312
- Three.
- Sydney?

569
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:11,352
(Sydney?)

570
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:12,723
I told you!

571
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,853
I told you he wouldn't know!

572
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:17,492
(Everyone cheers!)

573
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:19,052
I told you he wouldn't know!

574
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:20,392
(What is it? Did I get it right?)

575
00:18:20,393 --> 00:18:21,863
Seon Ho, so what's the capital city?

576
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:23,662
- Gosh.
- I told you he wouldn't know!

577
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:24,732
- Good job.
- Well done.

578
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:27,202
- I told you he wouldn't know!
- You did well.

579
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:28,379
(The most delightful wrong answer in the world)

580
00:18:28,403 --> 00:18:29,732
(It's shocking that he said Sydney as his answer.)

581
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,802
- My gosh.
- I...

582
00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:31,803
You still don't know what it is?

583
00:18:31,803 --> 00:18:32,803
No.

584
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:35,342
You didn't lose any dishes with this question.

585
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:36,343
- Okay.
- Yes.

586
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:37,642
It means we secured the oxtails.

587
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:39,012
- That's right. We secured them.
- We did.

588
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:40,882
This feels amazing.

589
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:42,612
The next question will involve...

590
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:44,213
- Jong Min.
- Okay.

591
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:46,322
Se Yoon, you should take point with this one.

592
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:48,582
Sure, it's Jong Min. I can totally guess what he'll do.

593
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,852
- Jong Min.
- Okay.

594
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:51,822
- Try to be...
- Do what you'd typically do.

595
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:53,462
As selfish as possible.

596
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:55,192
Selfish? Okay. I'll only think about myself.

597
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:56,392
- Think only about yourself.
- Jong Min...

598
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:58,439
I even know what kind of video he watches on YouTube.

599
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:00,779
- I saw the video he was watching.
- You're our only hope.

600
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:01,862
- We just need to secure one more.
- Gosh, this is amazing.

601
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,202
- That will be great then.
- Yes.

602
00:19:03,203 --> 00:19:04,432
- Just 1 more.
- Let's secure 1 more.

603
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:05,472
If we can secure one more, which one will it be?

604
00:19:05,473 --> 00:19:06,473
The sundae or the stew?

605
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:08,673
- All right. Everyone.
- Let's go.

606
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:10,642
We must get this right.

607
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:13,982
Jong Min has been on the show for 18 years.

608
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:15,043
He had to play...

609
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:17,853
the Sand Lance Coffee Game countless times.

610
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:21,182
- We must predict the result?
- Really?

611
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:23,393
This is about Jong Min's skills.

612
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:24,652
Right.

613
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:26,092
There are four cups of sand lance coffee.

614
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:28,192
And there's only one cup of Americano.

615
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:29,833
He must pick out the Americano.

616
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:32,433
But there are too many cups of sand lance coffee.

617
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:35,103
Jong Min has a trick when observing them.

618
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:37,972
Don't worry about it. Just rest for a bit and go back in.

619
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:38,973
- Okay.
- Yes.

620
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:42,043
(Anxious)

621
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:45,042
(Make sure Jong Min doesn't turn around.)

622
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:46,883
- From now on, - From now on?

623
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:49,243
- you cannot turn around.
- Okay.

624
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:55,013
You'll time me on how long I can go without turning around.

625
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:57,293
I won't turn around until the end.

626
00:19:58,093 --> 00:20:00,823
(No, it's to bring in the sand lance coffee.)

627
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:03,532
I think yours will be easy.

628
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:04,933
(Glancing)

629
00:20:05,193 --> 00:20:06,633
Why do you keep glancing over there?

630
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:09,303
You kept glancing, so you'd get me to turn around.

631
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:10,703
You want to trick me.

632
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:12,333
Do you think I'm a fool?

633
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:15,042
(Thanks to that, the coffee goes in safely.)

634
00:20:15,043 --> 00:20:17,142
Everyone, don't get too close. Stand back.

635
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:19,413
All right. Jong Min would pick this one.

636
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:21,942
- You didn't close them with a lid?
- This has a lot of foam.

637
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:22,952
- But...
- Really?

638
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:25,452
- I can't tell at all.
- I can't tell with the naked eye.

639
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:26,522
There's no way he can pick it out.

640
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:27,952
- We must bet that he can't.
- Then...

641
00:20:27,953 --> 00:20:28,953
He can't do this.

642
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:30,692
- Let's say he can't do it.
- He can't do it.

643
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:33,662
But Jong Min gets competitive at things like this.

644
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,362
"Right. I'll just find the sand lance coffee."

645
00:20:36,363 --> 00:20:37,723
But that's a hard thing to do too.

646
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,932
If the odds were 1 to 3,

647
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,362
- I could have believed in him.
- But five...

648
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:41,402
- But five...
- Okay.

649
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:42,832
- He's not a deity. He can't.
- But...

650
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,803
- you're overestimating Jong Min.
- Yes.

651
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,972
- He can't.
- This is a 20 percent chance.

652
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:47,442
- We can't bet on that chance.
- Right.

653
00:20:47,443 --> 00:20:49,043
We'll say that he can't do it.

654
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:50,572
So you don't think he can.

655
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:51,693
- You can enter now.
- What?

656
00:20:54,613 --> 00:20:56,653
(He turns around with determination.)

657
00:20:57,153 --> 00:20:59,453
All right. Jong Min.

658
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:01,752
- Enter.
- Okay.

659
00:21:01,753 --> 00:21:02,922
(He spots sand lance coffee.)

660
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:04,369
- All right. Jong Min.
- Don't worry.

661
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:05,993
- Yes?
- You can't get too close.

662
00:21:06,123 --> 00:21:07,162
All right.

663
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:08,869
(He starts observing the coffee out of reflex.)

664
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,792
- So...
- I see. That's not it.

665
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:11,863
Jong Min.

666
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:14,163
Find the Americano.

667
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:15,963
- There's only one cup?
- Yes.

668
00:21:16,503 --> 00:21:17,973
Then I wonder if I can do it.

669
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,502
But there's no way to tell. I really can't tell...

670
00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:22,142
- no matter how hard I look.
- I can't tell with the naked eye.

671
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:24,343
- You can't get closer.
- Okay. I'll observe from here.

672
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:26,712
(He has to fail this mission.)

673
00:21:26,713 --> 00:21:28,042
I don't see any difference.

674
00:21:28,043 --> 00:21:29,552
(But he's especially focused on this mission.)

675
00:21:29,553 --> 00:21:32,312
- Jong Min.
- You guys improved your game a lot.

676
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:35,053
Jong Min, try to figure out what our question must have been.

677
00:21:35,623 --> 00:21:37,192
- What?
- Just relax.

678
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:38,193
(Just get it wrong.)

679
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:40,323
See? He has to drink it. So he's super careful.

680
00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:42,662
He's self-centered.

681
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:43,932
- It's about his health.
- Yes.

682
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:45,533
Of course. His health comes first.

683
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:47,733
He'll probably...

684
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:49,633
It's between numbers 2 and 5.

685
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:50,932
- Numbers 2 and 5.
- All right.

686
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:52,273
I'm between numbers 2 and 5.

687
00:21:52,503 --> 00:21:54,003
You must pick one now.

688
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:56,513
I'll go with number two.

689
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:58,042
Number two.

690
00:21:58,043 --> 00:21:59,642
(He picks number 2.)

691
00:21:59,643 --> 00:22:01,113
Gosh, I don't think this is the one.

692
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:03,713
Jong Min has to be just like everyone else.

693
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:05,582
(Will he overcome the 1-to-5 odds?)

694
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,652
- Here it goes.
- Okay.

695
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:08,383
(Will he overcome the 1-to-5 odds?)

696
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:12,423
(Is he gulping it down?)

697
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:16,793
(If it's Americano, their mission fails.)

698
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,533
- This is crazy.
- What?

699
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:25,202
(In despair)

700
00:22:25,203 --> 00:22:26,902
- What?
- Jong Min, you succeeded.

701
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:28,772
(He finds the Americano, beating the incredible odds.)

702
00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:29,813
Seriously?

703
00:22:30,913 --> 00:22:32,572
(But the members' prediction has failed.)

704
00:22:32,573 --> 00:22:33,613
I can't believe he did it.

705
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,582
(This can't be possible.)

706
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:37,623
I can't believe he did it.

707
00:22:37,853 --> 00:22:38,883
Did you see that?

708
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:41,182
- No, that's not it.
- Jong Min, I got goosebumps.

709
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:42,183
How did you do this?

710
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:43,752
- See?
- This isn't what we wanted.

711
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:45,723
- See? What do you mean?
- This isn't good.

712
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,293
Why did you get it right?

713
00:22:47,563 --> 00:22:48,883
He told me to find the Americano.

714
00:22:49,023 --> 00:22:50,562
How could you get this right?

715
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:52,463
We said that you couldn't.

716
00:22:52,693 --> 00:22:54,003
But how did you figure it out?

717
00:22:54,463 --> 00:22:55,733
I just took a random guess.

718
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:59,973
- I feel so dejected now.
- Jong Min gave me goosebumps.

719
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:01,842
- Let's remove the squid sundae.
- Okay.

720
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:02,912
Let's have the braised oxtails...

721
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:03,943
- and the stew.
- Yes.

722
00:23:04,013 --> 00:23:05,213
We have to get the next one.

723
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:08,543
The next question will involve Joon.

724
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:10,312
Joon, just be yourself.

725
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:13,453
Seriously. I'm very average. I do what everyone does.

726
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:15,182
Let's begin.

727
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:16,322
(Round 6 begins right away.)

728
00:23:16,323 --> 00:23:18,753
If Joon were to be abandoned on a deserted island...

729
00:23:18,993 --> 00:23:22,123
You can only pick one member to come with you.

730
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:24,863
(Again, the odds are 1 in 5.)

731
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:27,963
I must consider their typical images.

732
00:23:28,563 --> 00:23:30,033
Considering their typical images...

733
00:23:31,003 --> 00:23:33,302
- I...
- I don't think it's Jong Min.

734
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:35,543
Jong Min is all about self-survival.

735
00:23:35,743 --> 00:23:37,172
- Jong Min...
- Listen. Jong Min is...

736
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:39,513
Jong Min only thinks about himself.

737
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:40,712
(The members are spot on.)

738
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:42,413
"I must survive."

739
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:44,382
He works out with Seon Ho.

740
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:46,213
They talk to each other in private.

741
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:48,823
But it can't be Seon Ho.

742
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:51,223
I don't think Seon Ho knows any survival skills.

743
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:53,622
I feel bad because it feels like I'm criticizing him.

744
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:54,792
(The members are spot on again.)

745
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:57,163
- You're out.
- You're eliminated.

746
00:23:58,033 --> 00:23:59,132
There are two people left.

747
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,003
- No, 3.
- Right, there are 3 people left.

748
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:04,432
To me, DinDin comes across...

749
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:07,173
- as someone who's smart.
- Okay.

750
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:09,743
But on a deserted island, survival is key.

751
00:24:11,613 --> 00:24:15,143
(DinDin is too small and weak to survive.)

752
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:17,353
I will exclude DinDin.

753
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:19,212
- You'll exclude DinDin?
- Yes.

754
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:22,423
Instead of DinDin, I need someone I can hunt with.

755
00:24:23,023 --> 00:24:24,223
I would need such a partner.

756
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:26,362
Se Yoon is good at cooking.

757
00:24:26,363 --> 00:24:27,722
(Good at cooking)

758
00:24:27,723 --> 00:24:29,662
He's also strong, right?

759
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:32,793
He and I could join forces and go hunting.

760
00:24:33,803 --> 00:24:35,402
Sae Ho is also good.

761
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:36,932
- He's also good at cooking.
- I agree.

762
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,672
He's very agile.

763
00:24:38,673 --> 00:24:39,702
(Quick and agile)

764
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:41,572
I would definitely choose...

765
00:24:41,573 --> 00:24:42,973
- between the two of them.
- Right.

766
00:24:43,243 --> 00:24:46,273
I have to think in the most common way.

767
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:48,533
- I made up my mind.
- Which one?

768
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:52,283
We promised to think in a typical way.

769
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,923
You have to survive on a deserted island.

770
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,352
In order to survive, you need stamina...

771
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:59,023
and physical strength.

772
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:01,492
- So he needs Se Yoon...
- Se Yoon.

773
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:03,092
- in order to...
- But...

774
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:05,263
I agree with Sae Ho's opinion.

775
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:08,033
Would he pick Se Yoon? Strength is what they have in common.

776
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:11,232
Generally speaking, Joon should pick me.

777
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:12,532
I hope he won't be strange and think,

778
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:14,403
"Se Yoon eats too much."

779
00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:15,743
No, he wouldn't think that.

780
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:18,373
Se Yoon eats a lot, right?

781
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:20,643
He's strong in a completely different way from me.

782
00:25:20,713 --> 00:25:22,412
He said that he'd think typically.

783
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:23,612
Survival is key on a deserted island.

784
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:24,952
Eating is the most important for Joon.

785
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:26,283
Okay, let's go with Se Yoon.

786
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,552
- Okay, he's the top candidate.
- Yes.

787
00:25:28,553 --> 00:25:29,822
All right, everyone.

788
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:32,252
- Please close your eyes and wait.
- I'll stay like this.

789
00:25:32,253 --> 00:25:33,262
Okay.

790
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:34,893
Go inside now.

791
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:37,933
Hug the member of your choice from behind.

792
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:39,193
Got it.

793
00:25:41,863 --> 00:25:43,372
If we fail this time, we'll be in trouble.

794
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:45,273
(Joon's choice)

795
00:25:46,473 --> 00:25:49,242
(Did the other members guess Joon's choice correctly?)

796
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,043
Please.

797
00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:54,343
(The members picked Se Yoon.)

798
00:25:55,783 --> 00:25:58,853
(Joon is walking toward Se Yoon.)

799
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,023
(Will it be Se Yoon as the members predicted?)

800
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:07,863
(Joon picked Sae Ho.)

801
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,393
Did we fail?

802
00:26:11,763 --> 00:26:13,462
Everyone, please raise your heads.

803
00:26:13,463 --> 00:26:14,632
- What?
- Did we lose?

804
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:15,703
- What happened?
- What?

805
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,973
Did Joon already answer?

806
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,273
I thought that he was playing around.

807
00:26:21,003 --> 00:26:22,072
- What?
- Did you pick me?

808
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:23,242
- Why?
- Did you pick me?

809
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:24,272
- Why?
- What?

810
00:26:24,273 --> 00:26:25,412
- Why did you?
- What's the reason?

811
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:26,413
- What?
- Tell us why.

812
00:26:26,414 --> 00:26:27,743
- What's the reason?
- Why?

813
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:30,483
They had the exact same qualifications.

814
00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:32,952
- What did I lack compared to him?
- We entered at the same time.

815
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:34,152
(We entered the show at the same time.)

816
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:35,153
That's why.

817
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:37,193
- So...
- I thought that you'd bring it up.

818
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:39,113
Otherwise, who would have been your choice?

819
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:41,192
- Then I would've picked you.
- Really?

820
00:26:41,193 --> 00:26:42,599
Isn't that a more common way of thinking?

821
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:44,362
The fact that you entered at the same time is personal.

822
00:26:44,363 --> 00:26:45,562
You said that you'd think typically.

823
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:47,332
When he said that he picked me because...

824
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:49,333
- we entered in the same year...
- Goodness.

825
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:52,633
You promised to think typically as you went out.

826
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:54,619
What's on everyone's mind when making a choice?

827
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:56,542
It shows how hard it is to read people's minds.

828
00:26:56,543 --> 00:26:58,173
Thank you anyway for thinking of me.

829
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:00,742
We keep missing each other by a small difference.

830
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:01,743
I thought...

831
00:27:02,013 --> 00:27:03,482
We'll take out the spicy floating goby stew.

832
00:27:03,483 --> 00:27:04,553
- All right.
- Goodness.

833
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:07,282
- I'm hungry.
- I'm exhausted from hunger.

834
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:09,582
The trivet looks very lonely.

835
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:10,653
There's only one.

836
00:27:10,823 --> 00:27:12,193
We need at least three.

837
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:14,792
Exactly like how you picked the Americano,

838
00:27:14,793 --> 00:27:17,263
you picked this out of 5, so there's only 1.

839
00:27:18,063 --> 00:27:19,293
Didn't I make a good choice?

840
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,333
Yes, you made a good choice. It was impressive.

841
00:27:22,603 --> 00:27:23,932
Only you could do it.

842
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,932
If I were the viewer, I'd think that it was planned.

843
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:28,002
That was impossible to guess correctly.

844
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:29,043
I was surprised too.

845
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:30,943
I felt proud.

846
00:27:31,843 --> 00:27:34,012
As I said, his own success and happiness...

847
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:35,813
are more important than anything else.

848
00:27:35,983 --> 00:27:37,212
- "His own success?"
- Yes.

849
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:38,353
I drank it up.

850
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:40,122
The food is coming.

851
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:41,682
The portion is quite generous.

852
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:43,153
There's a lot of rice.

853
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,522
(Heaps of rice)

854
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:45,623
I want more food.

855
00:27:46,023 --> 00:27:47,792
- It's a lot of food.
- You served us a little more.

856
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:48,822
Yes.

857
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:50,592
- I'm grateful.
- They served a lot for us.

858
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:51,892
The amount isn't bad. I'm grateful for that.

859
00:27:51,893 --> 00:27:53,032
- Please distribute it.
- Distribute it.

860
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:54,033
Okay.

861
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:55,262
Use these tongs.

862
00:27:55,263 --> 00:27:57,102
Distribute the food...

863
00:27:57,103 --> 00:27:59,272
- on the plate for every person.
- Please serve everyone.

864
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:00,302
Be completely fair.

865
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,073
- Serve everyone equally.
- One.

866
00:28:02,703 --> 00:28:03,712
- Two.
- Two.

867
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:05,042
- Add one more piece of meat.
- One.

868
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:06,113
It looks great.

869
00:28:06,413 --> 00:28:08,412
- This much is good.
- There's enough.

870
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:10,312
Knowing how to distribute food is more important...

871
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,993
- than knowing about Vienna.
- Definitely.

872
00:28:12,553 --> 00:28:13,822
One.

873
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:16,593
Why are you serving yourself food from the bottom?

874
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:18,593
- Yours has more sauce.
- One.

875
00:28:19,053 --> 00:28:21,262
- He can serve us the sauce.
- He can pour it on top.

876
00:28:21,263 --> 00:28:22,422
We get to eat thanks to him.

877
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:23,793
He didn't know the answer.

878
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:26,193
Jong Min, that's enough.

879
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:28,763
- Okay.
- Let's eat.

880
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:30,102
Thank you for the food.

881
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:31,679
It's a little disappointing, but thank you anyway.

882
00:28:31,703 --> 00:28:33,303
Look at the oxtail. It's thick.

883
00:28:34,873 --> 00:28:38,573
(When you take a bite of the thick braised oxtail...)

884
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:40,933
- It's delicious.
- Goodness.

885
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:42,513
It's chewy.

886
00:28:44,753 --> 00:28:46,052
(Digging right in)

887
00:28:46,053 --> 00:28:48,152
- This is really good.
- It's rich.

888
00:28:48,153 --> 00:28:49,622
(Very satisfied)

889
00:28:49,623 --> 00:28:50,793
Thank you, Seon Ho.

890
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:52,813
Eating this gives me a lot of strength.

891
00:28:53,293 --> 00:28:54,393
The seasoning is...

892
00:28:55,123 --> 00:28:56,763
nice and thick.

893
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:59,173
- I'd like some kimchi.
- That's the only thing missing.

894
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:00,902
It's really delicious.

895
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:02,633
The combination of food is important.

896
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:04,533
- I agree.
- It's invigorating food.

897
00:29:08,503 --> 00:29:10,912
- I'm satisfied with this one dish.
- Me too.

898
00:29:10,913 --> 00:29:11,943
The sauce is...

899
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:14,213
You know what?

900
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:16,112
I don't know about anything else,

901
00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:18,183
- but I'd love some kimchi.
- I agree.

902
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:19,953
That's the only thing missing.

903
00:29:20,223 --> 00:29:21,782
(My kimchi.)

904
00:29:21,783 --> 00:29:24,823
There's more food that our chef prepared.

905
00:29:24,953 --> 00:29:25,992
Right.

906
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:27,492
- He prepared it for us.
- I'm sure...

907
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:30,193
- the viewers...
- I'm sorry. We aren't good enough.

908
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,062
There's food that we'd like to show the viewers.

909
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:33,263
He's up to something.

910
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:35,313
- What are you up to?
- What are we doing?

911
00:29:35,503 --> 00:29:37,173
We can't give you the entire dish.

912
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:39,103
- Among the dishes that you lost, - Yes?

913
00:29:39,203 --> 00:29:40,872
- we'll give you some of them.
- Just for a taste?

914
00:29:40,873 --> 00:29:42,743
We'll give you one portion.

915
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:44,813
- It will be an individual game.
- Okay.

916
00:29:45,373 --> 00:29:46,373
That sounds good.

917
00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:49,313
You'll see a mix of consonants and vowels of a word.

918
00:29:49,443 --> 00:29:50,582
- Consonants and vowels?
- Okay.

919
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:51,612
(Sports: Badminton)

920
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:55,083
(A game of guessing the word)

921
00:29:55,423 --> 00:29:57,992
Shout out your name if you know the answer.

922
00:29:57,993 --> 00:29:59,193
- Okay.
- Then...

923
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:01,363
- With kimchi?
- we'll start with kimchi.

924
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:04,333
One, two, three.

925
00:30:04,663 --> 00:30:06,393
- Ta-da.
- What is it?

926
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:12,103
(Singer: A, O, I, S, B, N, O, K)

927
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:14,473
- What?
- This is really difficult.

928
00:30:15,873 --> 00:30:17,043
The name of a singer?

929
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:19,472
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min?

930
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:20,843
- BTS.
- Wrong.

931
00:30:21,983 --> 00:30:23,012
- Se Yoon.
- Se Yoon?

932
00:30:23,013 --> 00:30:24,383
- IVE.
- Wrong.

933
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:26,433
- Does it include all of them?
- Yes.

934
00:30:26,553 --> 00:30:28,352
(Singer: A, O, I, S, B, N, O, K)

935
00:30:28,353 --> 00:30:30,553
(Wrong when any consonant or vowel remains)

936
00:30:30,753 --> 00:30:33,623
All these consonants and vowels make up...

937
00:30:34,163 --> 00:30:35,563
- the word.
- Right.

938
00:30:35,923 --> 00:30:36,932
- Joon.
- Joon?

939
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:37,963
TVXQ.

940
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:39,633
(Is the answer TVXQ?)

941
00:30:39,634 --> 00:30:40,954
- That's correct.
- That's right.

942
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,003
(That's right.)

943
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:45,332
(When the consonants and vowels are combined)

944
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,573
(Joon is correct.)

945
00:30:47,903 --> 00:30:50,212
(He got the correct answer by concentrating.)

946
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:52,613
He's good at pick up and play games.

947
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:55,582
(What has passed)

948
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:56,642
It was TVXQ.

949
00:30:56,643 --> 00:30:58,613
(He's the only one excited.)

950
00:30:59,313 --> 00:31:00,523
What is he doing?

951
00:31:00,823 --> 00:31:01,983
This isn't my fault.

952
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:03,823
Joon acquired the kimchi.

953
00:31:04,223 --> 00:31:06,322
You're amazing. Joon is good at pick up and play games.

954
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,692
(The king of pick up and play games)

955
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:09,853
The king of pick up and play games. I lost the kimchi.

956
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:12,762
Next, the squid sundae is on the line.

957
00:31:12,763 --> 00:31:14,103
I have to eat some squid sundae.

958
00:31:14,803 --> 00:31:15,862
Ta-da.

959
00:31:15,863 --> 00:31:20,772
(Sport: Eo, K, Eu, I, J, S, M, P)

960
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:21,802
Ta-da.

961
00:31:21,803 --> 00:31:23,043
- DinDin.
- DinDin?

962
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:26,042
(That fast?)

963
00:31:26,043 --> 00:31:27,383
- DinDin.
- DinDin?

964
00:31:27,543 --> 00:31:28,613
Ski Jumping.

965
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:30,113
- That's correct.
- Right.

966
00:31:30,353 --> 00:31:31,482
- Well done.
- DinDin is correct.

967
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:32,513
Okay.

968
00:31:33,153 --> 00:31:35,852
(Sport: Ski jumping)

969
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:36,922
Okay.

970
00:31:36,923 --> 00:31:38,822
(DinDin is correct.)

971
00:31:38,823 --> 00:31:39,922
What?

972
00:31:39,923 --> 00:31:41,422
(Celebrating by ski jumping)

973
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:43,392
DinDin won some squid sundae.

974
00:31:43,393 --> 00:31:44,793
Okay.

975
00:31:44,993 --> 00:31:46,392
- I had no idea.
- I got goosebumps.

976
00:31:46,393 --> 00:31:48,002
- I could only see...
- He was quick.

977
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:49,032
"kiss."

978
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,672
We just need to figure out what's key.

979
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:52,649
- You see the word "kiss" again?
- I keep seeing the word "kiss."

980
00:31:52,673 --> 00:31:53,973
His priority is kiss.

981
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:57,243
- Next is fried eel.
- Okay.

982
00:31:57,643 --> 00:31:58,913
- Here we go.
- Please.

983
00:31:59,113 --> 00:32:01,613
- This one is expensive.
- I must win this. It'll be tasty.

984
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:03,983
Ta-da.

985
00:32:05,953 --> 00:32:07,883
(It makes them groan as soon as they see it.)

986
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:12,653
(Food: J, S, I, A, G, N, Eu, Eu, O, D, Ch)

987
00:32:13,623 --> 00:32:16,163
(I have absolutely no idea.)

988
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,693
(Serious)

989
00:32:20,163 --> 00:32:21,503
"Denjang stew?"

990
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:23,403
"Denchan stew?"

991
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:26,433
(He has no idea, so he comes up with a new dish.)

992
00:32:27,003 --> 00:32:28,302
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min?

993
00:32:28,303 --> 00:32:29,403
Blanched eggplant.

994
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:30,873
Wrong.

995
00:32:31,073 --> 00:32:32,713
(Embarrassed)

996
00:32:32,973 --> 00:32:34,783
Is it a dish that we know?

997
00:32:35,043 --> 00:32:36,843
You'll be surprised when you hear the answer.

998
00:32:37,753 --> 00:32:39,383
- Give us a hint.
- A hint?

999
00:32:39,753 --> 00:32:40,982
You can also give us the initials.

1000
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:42,153
Wait, they're already given.

1001
00:32:43,423 --> 00:32:44,653
(Laughing)

1002
00:32:45,623 --> 00:32:47,363
The hint is that it has five characters.

1003
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:49,123
- Five characters?
- That's...

1004
00:32:49,623 --> 00:32:50,932
(No one can figure out this one.)

1005
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:51,993
What is this?

- Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho?

00:33:05,043 --> 00:33:06,143
Cheese pork cutlet.

1013
00:33:06,883 --> 00:33:08,213
Cheese pork cutlet.

1014
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,083
Correct.

1015
00:33:10,084 --> 00:33:11,352
(Cheese pork cutlet)

1016
00:33:11,353 --> 00:33:12,612
Cheese pork cutlet.

1017
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:14,093
I pronounced it slightly differently.

1018
00:33:14,123 --> 00:33:15,252
He said, "Cutlet."

1019
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:16,413
- Cheese pork cutlet.
- What?

1020
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,592
But this is...

1021
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:18,752
Isn't it cheese pork cutlet?

1022
00:33:18,753 --> 00:33:19,753
- Cheese pork cutlet.
- Seon Ho.

1023
00:33:19,754 --> 00:33:21,362
- Se Yoon.
- Cheese pork cutlet.

1024
00:33:21,363 --> 00:33:22,762
- Hey.
- I was right.

1025
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:25,203
I said it in Japanese because I lived there when I was young.

1026
00:33:25,293 --> 00:33:26,432
(Rapping)

1027
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:27,702
- That's why.
- He mispronounced it.

1028
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:28,733
(Laughing)

1029
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,802
- Se Yoon. He was wrong.
- Cheese pork cutlet.

1030
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:32,202
- Cheese pork cutlet.
- Goodness.

1031
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:33,972
The pronunciation...

1032
00:33:33,973 --> 00:33:35,573
must be accurate.

1033
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:37,242
He mispronounced "cheese pork cutlet."

1034
00:33:37,243 --> 00:33:38,742
(Their friendship is breaking in front of fried eel.)

1035
00:33:38,743 --> 00:33:40,513
- I had no idea about it.
- Right.

1036
00:33:40,913 --> 00:33:42,883
- I didn't know.
- This is the last question.

1037
00:33:43,183 --> 00:33:44,352
Everyone is winning something.

1038
00:33:44,353 --> 00:33:45,883
This game is fun.

1039
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:48,222
- Only two won't get anything.
- Here we go.

1040
00:33:48,223 --> 00:33:49,353
At this rate.

1041
00:33:49,523 --> 00:33:51,823
For a bowl of spicy floating goby stew...

1042
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:53,822
I want to try some spicy floating goby stew.

1043
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,893
I just want to taste it.

1044
00:33:55,363 --> 00:33:57,963
One, two, three.

1045
00:33:58,633 --> 00:33:59,692
Ta-da.

1046
00:33:59,693 --> 00:34:01,262
(Food: I, B, B, B, D, M, O, O, T, B, A, L, S, I)

1047
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:03,033
Gosh, what's this?

1048
00:34:03,303 --> 00:34:05,103
There are 3 Bs. No, there are 4.

1049
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:09,242
(What's the food name with 4 Bs?)

1050
00:34:09,243 --> 00:34:11,242
Bobo. Bobi.

1051
00:34:11,243 --> 00:34:14,013
Bibimbap!

1052
00:34:14,913 --> 00:34:17,413
- I don't think so.
- I don't know about bibimbap.

1053
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:21,023
Bibimbap. We can just take out all the Bs.

1054
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:24,692
Then it's left with "domo..."

1055
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:25,693
Wait.

1056
00:34:25,694 --> 00:34:26,922
T?

1057
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:28,463
(T)

1058
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:30,492
What could this be?

1059
00:34:30,493 --> 00:34:31,532
(I want some spicy floating goby stew.)

1060
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:33,533
(When "bibimbap" is taken out)

1061
00:34:34,403 --> 00:34:36,302
(Thinking)

1062
00:34:36,303 --> 00:34:37,472
- Four.
- Se Yoon.

1063
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:38,902
- Sae Ho.
- What?

1064
00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:40,673
- It's Se Yoon first.
- Stone pot bibimbap.

1065
00:34:41,803 --> 00:34:42,972
- Is that correct?
- It's correct.

1066
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:43,973
That's correct.

1067
00:34:44,873 --> 00:34:45,972
I also saw "stone pot bibimbap."

1068
00:34:45,973 --> 00:34:47,042
(Se Yoon won by a hair.)

1069
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,412
- It's stone pot bibimbap?
- Okay.

1070
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:50,283
For the letter T, I thought of taro...

1071
00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:52,812
- and ttukbaegi.
- I almost lost it to Sae Ho.

1072
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:53,822
(Food: Stone pot bibimbap)

1073
00:34:53,823 --> 00:34:55,223
I saw "stone pot bibimbap."

1074
00:34:56,453 --> 00:34:58,493
- Your food will be served soon.
- Okay.

1075
00:34:59,323 --> 00:35:00,363
I won some broth.

1076
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:03,162
- This is one plate.
- It's just as he promised.

1077
00:35:03,163 --> 00:35:04,233
The portion isn't bad.

1078
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:05,662
Here's the spicy floating goby stew.

1079
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:08,362
For a piece of squid sundae, can you give me some broth?

1080
00:35:08,363 --> 00:35:09,662
I'd like to trade it.

1081
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:11,633
Sure, give me your bowl.

1082
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,133
This is for Se Yoon.

1083
00:35:13,773 --> 00:35:15,372
- Take as much as you want.
- Okay.

1084
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:16,503
I gave him some rice.

1085
00:35:17,343 --> 00:35:18,742
This is strange.

1086
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:20,049
(A bite of fried eel that he worked hard to win)

1087
00:35:20,073 --> 00:35:22,289
- I never tasted anything like it.
- Fried eel is tasty.

1088
00:35:22,313 --> 00:35:23,542
How is this fried eel so good?

1089
00:35:23,543 --> 00:35:24,829
(Not only is it nutritious, but it also tastes perfect.)

1090
00:35:24,853 --> 00:35:28,282
(Se Yoon tastes some squid sundae.)

1091
00:35:28,283 --> 00:35:29,782
(It tastes...)

1092
00:35:29,783 --> 00:35:31,622
(so good!)

1093
00:35:31,623 --> 00:35:34,192
- The squid sundae is good.
- I wanted to eat that.

1094
00:35:34,193 --> 00:35:36,273
(Gangneung squid sundae that calls for exclamations)

1095
00:35:36,423 --> 00:35:37,662
The spicy floating goby stew is...

1096
00:35:37,663 --> 00:35:39,269
(Se Yoon tries the spicy floating goby stew.)

1097
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:42,862
(How does the spicy floating goby stew taste?)

1098
00:35:42,863 --> 00:35:45,232
The doenjang tastes strange.

1099
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:47,142
It tastes very refreshing.

1100
00:35:47,143 --> 00:35:49,742
It reminds me of lemongrass in tom yum kung.

1101
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:52,063
What I can say is that I've never tasted anything like it.

1102
00:35:52,773 --> 00:35:55,742
(Clearing the broth)

1103
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:56,743
It was a great meal.

1104
00:35:56,744 --> 00:35:58,412
- Everything was perfect.
- Thank you.

1105
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:00,252
It was amazing.

1106
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:03,123
(It's time to play Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.)

1107
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:05,723
We're doing something with water.

1108
00:36:06,223 --> 00:36:07,492
They didn't change the microphones.

1109
00:36:07,493 --> 00:36:09,193
(6 stools are lined up.)

1110
00:36:09,763 --> 00:36:12,392
(Behind them are...)

1111
00:36:12,393 --> 00:36:13,593
- What?
- Gosh.

1112
00:36:14,163 --> 00:36:15,563
It's water.

1113
00:36:15,803 --> 00:36:18,032
We haven't switched to waterproof microphones.

1114
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:19,602
- You're right.
- Everyone.

1115
00:36:19,603 --> 00:36:20,842
(Full of suspicion)

1116
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:23,442
- You're working hard in the heat.
- It's okay.

1117
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:26,212
That's why we prepared...

1118
00:36:26,213 --> 00:36:28,313
a very refreshing Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

1119
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:30,312
- Thank you.
- Right.

1120
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,482
It's the perfect weather for getting water splashed.

1121
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,422
It'll be refreshing. We'll take a shower anyway.

1122
00:36:34,423 --> 00:36:36,652
You wanted us to cool down before going to bed.

1123
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,122
- Thank you.
- It will also be refreshing...

1124
00:36:39,123 --> 00:36:40,792
- for the viewers in the hot summer.
- Okay.

1125
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:44,192
For the Heat Wave Special, we upgraded it...

1126
00:36:44,193 --> 00:36:45,492
to Keen Eyes People Quiz.

1127
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:46,562
(Keen Eyes People Quiz)

1128
00:36:46,563 --> 00:36:50,403
Guess the three people in the photo.

1129
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:52,872
When someone answers correctly,

1130
00:36:52,873 --> 00:36:55,502
each of the remaining five members will enjoy...

1131
00:36:55,503 --> 00:36:58,342
a refreshing water bomb.

1132
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:00,412
- Only 1 won't get it.
- Only 1 won't get it?

1133
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:02,382
- That's right.
- Goodness.

1134
00:37:02,383 --> 00:37:04,753
Each question is worth one point.

1135
00:37:05,113 --> 00:37:07,882
Only those with the top three final scores...

1136
00:37:07,883 --> 00:37:08,953
will sleep indoors.

1137
00:37:09,323 --> 00:37:10,652
The room only fits exactly three people.

1138
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:12,252
When one of you answers correctly,

1139
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:13,922
- someone else gets a turn next.
- You can't go again?

1140
00:37:13,923 --> 00:37:14,923
That sounds good.

1141
00:37:14,924 --> 00:37:17,662
You're not allowed to dodge the water bomb.

1142
00:37:17,663 --> 00:37:18,692
Of course not.

1143
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:19,963
If you dodge...

1144
00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:21,463
- No.
- Splash water on him.

1145
00:37:21,464 --> 00:37:23,632
If you get out of your seat to dodge,

1146
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:24,733
you have to sleep outdoors.

1147
00:37:25,073 --> 00:37:26,203
- Really?
- Yes.

1148
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,502
If you try to dodge or act like this,

1149
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:30,202
- you must sleep outdoors.
- Okay.

1150
00:37:30,203 --> 00:37:31,612
Why would you dodge? It's hot.

1151
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:32,742
Just accept the water bomb.

1152
00:37:32,743 --> 00:37:35,642
- We'll start without practice.
- Just go.

1153
00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:37,452
We know already. We don't need any practice.

1154
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:38,512
- Here we go.
- Okay.

1155
00:37:38,513 --> 00:37:40,523
- How do we answer this?
- Let's go.

1156
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:44,123
One, two, three. Ta-da.

1157
00:37:45,353 --> 00:37:47,923
(Who are the three people in this photo?)

1158
00:37:49,523 --> 00:37:54,002
(Concentrating)

1159
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:55,333
How many people are in it?

1160
00:37:55,863 --> 00:37:57,373
(Three people)

1161
00:37:57,703 --> 00:37:59,702
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho?

1162
00:37:59,703 --> 00:38:02,202
Cho Sae Ho, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Choi Min Su.

1163
00:38:02,203 --> 00:38:03,812
- DinDin.
- Wrong.

1164
00:38:03,813 --> 00:38:05,012
- DinDin.
- Wrong.

1165
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:06,013
(DinDin goes right away.)

1166
00:38:06,014 --> 00:38:08,282
Cho Sae Ho, Choo Sung Hoon, and Leonardo DiCaprio.

1167
00:38:08,283 --> 00:38:09,312
- Jong Min.
- It's correct.

1168
00:38:09,313 --> 00:38:10,313
It's correct.

1169
00:38:10,513 --> 00:38:11,583
DinDin?

1170
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:14,653
(Cho Sae Ho, Choo Sung Hoon, and Leonardo DiCaprio?)

1171
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:16,983
(- It's correct.
- It's correct.)

1172
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:18,852
(Please...)

1173
00:38:18,853 --> 00:38:19,922
- Really?
- What?

1174
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:20,923
(Did he answer already?)

1175
00:38:21,023 --> 00:38:22,062
Correct.

1176
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:23,123
(DinDin is correct.)

1177
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:24,833
(In awe)

1178
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:30,703
(Dropping the water bombs)

1179
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:34,203
(Ice-cold water)

1180
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:36,673
(Screaming)

1181
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,042
(Getting up)

1182
00:38:40,043 --> 00:38:42,982
He stood up.

1183
00:38:42,983 --> 00:38:44,552
He got the water bomb.

1184
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:46,012
I stood up after getting the water.

1185
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:47,182
(Punishing him)

1186
00:38:47,183 --> 00:38:49,229
- You said that it wasn't cold.
- The water is cold.

1187
00:38:49,253 --> 00:38:50,422
It's freezing.

1188
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:51,903
- The water is cold.
- It's freezing.

1189
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:53,793
- I'm cold.
- The water is cold?

1190
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:55,293
It dropped on me directly.

1191
00:38:55,393 --> 00:38:57,533
- Is the water cold?
- It's freezing.

1192
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,492
(Cho Sae Ho)

1193
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:00,532
(Choo Sung Hoon)

1194
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:01,603
(Leonardo DiCaprio)

1195
00:39:01,963 --> 00:39:06,602
(Answer: Cho Sae Ho, Choo Sung Hoon, Leonardo DiCaprio)

1196
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:08,903
I saw my face and Leonardo DiCaprio.

1197
00:39:09,903 --> 00:39:12,443
Where's Choo Sung Hoon?

1198
00:39:12,873 --> 00:39:14,482
I didn't expect a foreign actor.

1199
00:39:14,483 --> 00:39:15,483
Are foreign actors included?

1200
00:39:15,484 --> 00:39:18,112
- There are some of them.
- Okay.

1201
00:39:18,113 --> 00:39:19,612
I thought that it was Lee Byung Hun.

1202
00:39:19,613 --> 00:39:22,322
So far, DinDin is ahead of everyone by one point.

1203
00:39:22,323 --> 00:39:23,963
- It's worth one point?
- I was so close.

1204
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:25,423
Here's the second question.

1205
00:39:25,653 --> 00:39:26,693
Here we go.

1206
00:39:27,023 --> 00:39:29,893
One, two, three. Ta-da.

1207
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:33,262
- Gosh, who are they?
- Who are they?

1208
00:39:33,263 --> 00:39:34,863
(Who are you?)

1209
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:36,803
- I got two people.
- Me too.

1210
00:39:37,573 --> 00:39:38,672
- You did?
- Yes.

1211
00:39:38,673 --> 00:39:41,373
(The older members can't figure it out.)

1212
00:39:42,473 --> 00:39:45,113
(How many people did you figure out?)

1213
00:39:45,973 --> 00:39:47,713
- DinDin.
- DinDin?

1214
00:39:48,143 --> 00:39:49,242
I recognize two people.

1215
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:50,343
Lee Jung Jae.

1216
00:39:52,913 --> 00:39:53,983
Jung Woo Sung.

1217
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:56,253
Choi Soo Jong.

1218
00:39:56,683 --> 00:39:57,953
- Soo Jong...
- Wrong.

1219
00:39:58,193 --> 00:39:59,692
- Joon.
- He was right about one person.

1220
00:39:59,693 --> 00:40:00,723
(One of them is correct.)

1221
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:02,323
He has a mustache.

1222
00:40:03,463 --> 00:40:04,662
- Joon.
- Joon?

1223
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:05,933
(Joon gives it a try.)

1224
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:07,362
He farted.

1225
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,632
- Lee Jung Jae.
- Yes.

1226
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:10,233
- Jang Dong Gun.
- Yes.

1227
00:40:10,673 --> 00:40:11,902
- What?
- Goodness.

1228
00:40:11,903 --> 00:40:13,902
- It was so loud.
- My gosh.

1229
00:40:13,903 --> 00:40:14,903
Goodness.

1230
00:40:14,904 --> 00:40:16,042
- Joon.
- Joon?

1231
00:40:16,043 --> 00:40:19,343
(Jong Min released his poisonous gas silently.)

1232
00:40:19,813 --> 00:40:21,413
(He thought that he'd get away with it.)

1233
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:24,152
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

1234
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:25,652
- It was so loud.
- My gosh.

1235
00:40:25,653 --> 00:40:28,322
Who would fart during a game?

1236
00:40:28,323 --> 00:40:30,283
- I didn't fart.
- Jong Min is insane.

1237
00:40:30,953 --> 00:40:32,953
- I didn't fart.
- Joon, keep going.

1238
00:40:33,853 --> 00:40:34,893
Kim Min Jong.

1239
00:40:35,323 --> 00:40:36,363
He's right.

1240
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,673
Wrong. You got one person right.

1241
00:40:38,963 --> 00:40:40,232
Lee Jung Jae must be one of them.

1242
00:40:40,233 --> 00:40:41,262
Only one person?

1243
00:40:41,263 --> 00:40:42,632
(Only one of them is correct.)

1244
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:44,273
Jang Dong Gun and Kim Min Jong are wrong?

1245
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:46,202
- Lee Jung Jae must be one of them.
- Only one person?

1246
00:40:46,203 --> 00:40:47,203
(Lee Jung Jae is correct.)

1247
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:48,973
- Only 1 person is correct?
- It's 1 person.

1248
00:40:49,303 --> 00:40:50,663
- Is it Lee Jung Jae?
- All right.

1249
00:40:50,843 --> 00:40:52,012
- Isn't it Jang Dong Gun?
- Here's a hint.

1250
00:40:52,013 --> 00:40:53,989
- Isn't Jang Dong Gun one of them?
- It's Jang Dong Gun.

1251
00:40:54,013 --> 00:40:55,783
- There's Lee Jung Jae.
- What?

1252
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:58,153
One of them is an actress.

1253
00:40:58,353 --> 00:40:59,793
- The other is...
- Someone foreign.

1254
00:40:59,983 --> 00:41:01,353
- a foreign actor.
- Right.

1255
00:41:01,723 --> 00:41:04,093
Right, but I don't recognize the actress.

1256
00:41:04,823 --> 00:41:06,053
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho?

1257
00:41:06,323 --> 00:41:07,323
(Hesitating)

1258
00:41:07,324 --> 00:41:08,423
I might give them a hint.

1259
00:41:09,393 --> 00:41:11,092
- I won't answer.
- Sae Ho.

1260
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,162
- Lee Jung Jae.
- Yes.

1261
00:41:12,163 --> 00:41:13,232
- Son Ye Jin.
- Yes.

1262
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:14,233
George Clooney.

1263
00:41:14,903 --> 00:41:15,932
Wrong. One of them is correct.

1264
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:17,732
- One person?
- I can't remember...

1265
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:18,902
the foreign actor's name.

1266
00:41:18,903 --> 00:41:21,142
- Didn't his name come up last time?
- It's driving me crazy.

1267
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:22,243
I know his name.

1268
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:23,872
I just don't know who the actress is.

1269
00:41:23,873 --> 00:41:25,312
Sae Ho.

1270
00:41:25,313 --> 00:41:27,112
- The actress...
- I know who the actress is.

1271
00:41:27,113 --> 00:41:28,143
Me too.

1272
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:29,513
Who is it?

1273
00:41:29,743 --> 00:41:31,282
- Give it a try.
- Me too.

1274
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:32,452
- It's driving me crazy.
- I know who it is.

1275
00:41:32,453 --> 00:41:34,552
- I can't remember his name.
- Me neither.

1276
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:35,683
His name is difficult.

1277
00:41:36,383 --> 00:41:41,023
(Do you recognize the actress and the foreign actor?)

1278
00:41:42,663 --> 00:41:43,693
Seon Ho.

1279
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,133
(Laughing)

1280
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,333
Hurry up.

1281
00:41:47,093 --> 00:41:48,963
I can't tell who the actress is.

1282
00:41:49,063 --> 00:41:50,633
- DinDin.
- DinDin?

1283
00:41:51,773 --> 00:41:53,073
- Lee Jung Jae.
- Yes.

1284
00:41:53,703 --> 00:41:55,143
- Robert Downey Jr.
- Yes.

1285
00:41:55,843 --> 00:41:56,843
Sunwoo Yong Yeo.

1286
00:41:56,844 --> 00:41:57,972
(Lee Jung Jae, Robert Downey Jr., Sunwoo Yong Yeo)

1287
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,653
- That's correct.
- Two of them are right.

1288
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,643
Wrong. Two of them are right.

1289
00:42:01,643 --> 00:42:02,643
Seon Ho.

1290
00:42:03,143 --> 00:42:04,613
Robert Downey Jr., Lee Jung Jae,

1291
00:42:06,383 --> 00:42:07,452
and Yum Jung Ah.

1292
00:42:07,453 --> 00:42:08,699
(Robert Downey Jr., Lee Jung Jae, Yum Jung Ah)

1293
00:42:08,723 --> 00:42:10,422
- What? Is it correct?
- That's correct.

1294
00:42:10,423 --> 00:42:11,752
- He's correct.
- It's correct.

1295
00:42:11,753 --> 00:42:13,453
Seon Ho is correct.

1296
00:42:14,893 --> 00:42:16,392
(Lee Jung Jae)

1297
00:42:16,393 --> 00:42:18,062
(Robert Downey Jr.)

1298
00:42:18,063 --> 00:42:19,293
(Yum Jung Ah)

1299
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:23,133
(Answer: Lee Jung Jae, Robert Downey Jr., Yum Jung Ah)

1300
00:42:24,103 --> 00:42:25,172
My goodness.

1301
00:42:25,173 --> 00:42:27,443
(The penalty time is back.)

1302
00:42:27,943 --> 00:42:32,372
(Splash of cold water twice in a row)

1303
00:42:32,373 --> 00:42:33,442
My goodness.

1304
00:42:33,443 --> 00:42:34,882
(DinDin who was soft and dry turns moist.)

1305
00:42:34,883 --> 00:42:37,753
It's extremely cold!

1306
00:42:40,153 --> 00:42:44,953
(Water bombs are refreshing to watch.)

1307
00:42:45,853 --> 00:42:47,353
What's this?

1308
00:42:47,593 --> 00:42:49,593
(Frightened)

1309
00:42:50,323 --> 00:42:51,832
(Se Yoon flies.)

1310
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:53,562
- It's a bird.
- What's that?

1311
00:42:53,563 --> 00:42:57,472
(What caused the set to turn into chaos?)

1312
00:42:57,473 --> 00:42:58,502
What's that?

1313
00:42:58,503 --> 00:43:01,072
(A huge moth crashed the set.)

1314
00:43:01,073 --> 00:43:02,773
Did it fall with the water?

1315
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:06,342
There's a bird.

1316
00:43:06,343 --> 00:43:07,943
- All right.
- It's huge.

1317
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:10,882
(He musters up the courage to get closer.)

1318
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:11,883
Goodness.

1319
00:43:12,913 --> 00:43:15,253
- It's really big.
- It's huge.

1320
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:17,593
My goodness.

1321
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:18,992
- Gosh.
- It's okay now.

1322
00:43:18,993 --> 00:43:20,122
It landed.

1323
00:43:20,123 --> 00:43:21,662
Send it away.

1324
00:43:21,663 --> 00:43:23,363
What? What is he doing?

1325
00:43:23,593 --> 00:43:25,362
Keep going.

1326
00:43:25,363 --> 00:43:26,893
He's the boy with a hoop.

1327
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:29,163
- He runs.
- What?

1328
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:33,133
(The director shooed the moth toward the members.)

1329
00:43:33,673 --> 00:43:35,473
(Se Yoon flies again.)

1330
00:43:35,773 --> 00:43:37,973
(Chaotic)

1331
00:43:39,243 --> 00:43:40,243
It's gone.

1332
00:43:40,244 --> 00:43:41,482
(He's the only ninja assassin.)

1333
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:42,723
- He sent it away.
- It's gone.

1334
00:43:43,113 --> 00:43:45,353
Our production crew is kind. They let it live.

1335
00:43:45,783 --> 00:43:47,523
Let's check the answer.

1336
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,783
Here are the three people.

1337
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:52,692
I confused Yum Jung Ah's hairstyle with Johnny Depp's.

1338
00:43:52,693 --> 00:43:54,492
- Right.
- I had no idea.

1339
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:55,592
Did Seon Ho win one point?

1340
00:43:55,593 --> 00:43:59,593
Currently, DinDin and Seon Ho have one point each.

1341
00:44:00,863 --> 00:44:02,133
- Kim Hye Ja.
- Kim Hye Ja?

1342
00:44:02,503 --> 00:44:03,832
Jong Min, can you move to your left?

1343
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:06,003
- You should sit under the red dot.
- The red dot.

1344
00:44:06,403 --> 00:44:08,342
(Jong Min sneakily moved aside.)

1345
00:44:08,343 --> 00:44:09,772
He caught me. That's amazing.

1346
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,243
(I didn't know he'd notice it.)

1347
00:44:11,613 --> 00:44:12,742
- He's scary.
- I moved just a little bit.

1348
00:44:12,743 --> 00:44:16,112
Moving on, I think this is easier than the previous two questions.

1349
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:18,112
- I hope it's not too easy.
- All right. Here we go.

1350
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,113
I just have no clue.

1351
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:22,123
One, two, three. Ta-da.

1352
00:44:23,523 --> 00:44:24,623
Who are they?

1353
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:26,923
(Staring)

1354
00:44:26,953 --> 00:44:28,693
- I can see only one person.
- Sae Ho.

1355
00:44:29,063 --> 00:44:30,223
- Sae Ho.
- Go ahead.

1356
00:44:30,623 --> 00:44:33,932
Lee Sang Yi, Lee Jun Ho of 2PM,

1357
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:35,202
- and Yoon Kye Sang.
- DinDin.

1358
00:44:35,203 --> 00:44:36,203
Jong Min.

1359
00:44:36,204 --> 00:44:37,379
- Incorrect. You got one right.
- How many?

1360
00:44:37,403 --> 00:44:38,472
- Jong Min.
- Just one?

1361
00:44:38,473 --> 00:44:40,572
- Jong Min, go ahead.
- Lee Jun Ho...

1362
00:44:40,573 --> 00:44:41,943
- and Jung Dong Nam.
- Oh, right.

1363
00:44:43,003 --> 00:44:44,072
(Laughing)

1364
00:44:44,073 --> 00:44:46,543
It's just that there's something on the board.

1365
00:44:46,673 --> 00:44:47,843
- Then...
- Or not?

1366
00:44:48,243 --> 00:44:49,412
Something was on the board.

1367
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:51,533
(The mole on the forehead disappeared into thin air.)

1368
00:44:51,613 --> 00:44:53,183
Something was... Hey, that's not fair.

1369
00:44:53,713 --> 00:44:55,653
It was right on the forehead.

1370
00:44:56,483 --> 00:44:57,692
(Laughing)

1371
00:44:57,693 --> 00:44:59,622
- He said there was Jung Dong Nam.
- Sae Ho.

1372
00:44:59,623 --> 00:45:00,922
Sae Ho. Lee Sang Yi.

1373
00:45:00,923 --> 00:45:01,962
Yes.

1374
00:45:01,963 --> 00:45:06,163
And Kim Dong Hyun.

1375
00:45:06,293 --> 00:45:07,293
And Gong Yoo.

1376
00:45:07,294 --> 00:45:09,832
(They can see something?)

1377
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,033
- Gong Yoo.
- DinDin.

1378
00:45:11,303 --> 00:45:12,502
Incorrect. You got two right.

1379
00:45:12,503 --> 00:45:13,702
(Two of them are correct.)

1380
00:45:13,703 --> 00:45:14,802
- Joon.
- Go ahead.

1381
00:45:14,803 --> 00:45:16,523
Lee Sang Yi, Kim Dong Hyun, and Lee Jun Ho.

1382
00:45:17,003 --> 00:45:18,012
Incorrect. You got two right.

1383
00:45:18,013 --> 00:45:19,019
(There still are two right answers.)

1384
00:45:19,043 --> 00:45:20,542
(Lee Sang Yi, Kim Dong Hyun, and someone else)

1385
00:45:20,543 --> 00:45:22,189
- Is the last one a man?
- A handsome man.

1386
00:45:22,213 --> 00:45:23,312
- Se Yoon.
- Go ahead.

1387
00:45:23,313 --> 00:45:25,353
Lee Sang Yi, Kim Dong Hyun, and Park Bo Gum.

1388
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:26,583
- Incorrect.
- Jong Min.

1389
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:30,453
Lee Sang Yi, and...

1390
00:45:30,483 --> 00:45:32,522
Lee Sang Yi, Kim Dong Hyun,

1391
00:45:32,523 --> 00:45:33,923
and Cho Seung Woo.

1392
00:45:34,153 --> 00:45:35,192
- Incorrect.
- I knew it.

1393
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:37,763
Gosh. All three faces seem similar to one another.

1394
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:39,732
- Who is the last one?
- DinDin.

1395
00:45:39,733 --> 00:45:41,102
Can you tell us his age?

1396
00:45:41,103 --> 00:45:43,933
Okay. He was born in 1983.

1397
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:45,373
He's not very young.

1398
00:45:46,503 --> 00:45:48,443
- He's famous, right?
- Very much so.

1399
00:45:49,143 --> 00:45:50,273
- Joon.
- Go ahead.

1400
00:45:51,043 --> 00:45:52,542
Lee Sang Yi, Kim Dong Hyun, and Son Suk Ku.

1401
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:53,543
(Lee Sang Yi, Kim Dong Hyun, Son Suk Ku)

1402
00:45:53,544 --> 00:45:55,383
- That's right.
- It's Son Suk Ku.

1403
00:45:55,643 --> 00:45:57,852
(Has Joon finally started to get the right answers?)

1404
00:45:57,853 --> 00:45:59,052
Joon's answer is...

1405
00:45:59,053 --> 00:46:01,456
(Joon's answer is...)

1406
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,580
- Joon.
- Go ahead.

1407
00:46:03,214 --> 00:46:04,934
Lee Sang Yi, Kim Dong Hyun, and Son Suk Ku.

1408
00:46:05,524 --> 00:46:06,624
That's right.

1409
00:46:07,754 --> 00:46:09,153
(Has Joon finally started to get the right answers?)

1410
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:11,693
- It's Son Suk Ku.
- Joon's answer is correct.

1411
00:46:11,694 --> 00:46:13,934
(Joon got the correct answer!)

1412
00:46:14,194 --> 00:46:16,333
(The flashy celebratory move)

1413
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:18,134
Can you heat the water up before you dump it?

1414
00:46:18,804 --> 00:46:21,274
(We can't adjust the temperature of the water.)

1415
00:46:26,404 --> 00:46:28,543
(Refreshing)

1416
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:29,574
I'm so cold.

1417
00:46:30,014 --> 00:46:33,413
Why would you keep us awake? You should help us go to sleep.

1418
00:46:33,414 --> 00:46:34,884
Right? We're going to bed shortly.

1419
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:36,954
- Gosh, it's Son Suk Ku.
- It's so cold.

1420
00:46:36,984 --> 00:46:39,324
- It's Son Suk Ku.
- These three photos were combined.

1421
00:46:39,984 --> 00:46:41,094
I spotted Dong Hyun.

1422
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:42,853
(Kim Dong Hyun)

1423
00:46:42,854 --> 00:46:44,164
(Son Suk Ku)

1424
00:46:45,124 --> 00:46:47,963
(Lee Sang Yi, Kim Dong Hyun, Son Suk Ku)

1425
00:46:47,964 --> 00:46:50,634
This will help the viewers beat the heat for sure.

1426
00:46:51,004 --> 00:46:52,940
I feel like I'm in a room with the air conditioning set at 17°C.

1427
00:46:52,964 --> 00:46:54,974
What a shame. I could've spotted Son Suk Ku.

1428
00:46:56,004 --> 00:46:58,104
But it's okay. They all scored only one point.

1429
00:46:58,674 --> 00:46:59,703
These are your scores.

1430
00:46:59,704 --> 00:47:01,443
- We'll move on to the next round.
- I just need to get one more right.

1431
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:02,973
- Let's begin.
- Please.

1432
00:47:02,974 --> 00:47:04,843
Two, three. Ta-da.

1433
00:47:04,844 --> 00:47:07,283
(The fourth question)

1434
00:47:07,284 --> 00:47:08,883
Oh, that's... Gosh.

1435
00:47:08,884 --> 00:47:10,254
(Groaning)

1436
00:47:10,654 --> 00:47:12,584
(Focused)

1437
00:47:12,724 --> 00:47:14,253
- Joon.
- Go ahead.

1438
00:47:14,254 --> 00:47:16,253
John Park, Jin Sun Kyu, and Ok Taec Yeon.

1439
00:47:16,254 --> 00:47:17,323
(John Park, Jin Sun Kyu, Ok Taec Yeon)

1440
00:47:17,324 --> 00:47:20,894
- You got one person right.
- It's Jin Sun Kyu.

1441
00:47:21,894 --> 00:47:22,894
Joon. Oh, I can't try again...

1442
00:47:22,895 --> 00:47:24,163
- right after I try.
- Seon Ho.

1443
00:47:24,164 --> 00:47:26,103
- Go ahead.
- Jin Sun Kyu,

1444
00:47:26,104 --> 00:47:29,074
Lee Seung Gi, and Lee Jun Hyuk.

1445
00:47:29,404 --> 00:47:32,144
- That's wrong.
- He got two right, didn't he?

1446
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,114
- Incorrect. You got two right.
- Sae Ho.

1447
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:36,014
Jong Min.

1448
00:47:36,514 --> 00:47:37,754
The two of them he mentioned...

1449
00:47:38,714 --> 00:47:39,784
Who are those two?

1450
00:47:40,614 --> 00:47:42,184
- He doesn't know.
- Who are those two?

1451
00:47:43,624 --> 00:47:45,083
- Who are those two?
- Three.

1452
00:47:45,084 --> 00:47:46,423
- The ones you just mentioned.
- Two.

1453
00:47:46,424 --> 00:47:48,023
- Jin Sun Kyu.
- One.

1454
00:47:48,024 --> 00:47:49,800
- Jin Sun Kyu, and...
- I can't tell them apart.

1455
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:51,463
- And...
- Incorrect.

1456
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:52,763
- Joon.
- Go ahead.

1457
00:47:52,764 --> 00:47:54,484
Jin Sun Kyu, Lee Jun Hyuk, and Cha Eun Woo.

1458
00:47:55,064 --> 00:47:56,064
- Incorrect.
- Se Yoon.

1459
00:47:56,065 --> 00:47:58,380
- You got two right. Go ahead.
- Sun Kyu, Jun Hyuk, and Won Bin.

1460
00:47:58,404 --> 00:47:59,564
Incorrect. You got two right.

1461
00:48:00,304 --> 00:48:03,304
(Who could be the last one person that's hidden in this photo?)

1462
00:48:05,544 --> 00:48:06,743
Is he an actor?

1463
00:48:06,744 --> 00:48:07,773
- Jin Sun Kyu.
- Yes.

1464
00:48:07,774 --> 00:48:09,644
- DinDin. Lee Jun Hyuk, - Yes.

1465
00:48:10,114 --> 00:48:12,513
Jin Sun Kyu, and Kim Woo Bin.

1466
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,114
(Lee Jun Hyuk, Jin Sun Kyu, Kim Woo Bin)

1467
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:16,384
- I think he's right.
- That's Woo Bin's profile photo.

1468
00:48:16,784 --> 00:48:17,883
- No, that's wrong.
- That...

1469
00:48:17,884 --> 00:48:19,923
- turtleneck shirt...
- DinDin's answer is...

1470
00:48:19,924 --> 00:48:21,623
- What?
- correct.

1471
00:48:21,624 --> 00:48:23,400
Woo Bin is wearing a turtleneck shirt, right?

1472
00:48:23,424 --> 00:48:25,824
(DinDin is now ranked 1st.)

1473
00:48:26,524 --> 00:48:30,364
(They can't seem to get used to the cold water.)

1474
00:48:31,104 --> 00:48:32,164
(Blowing the lips)

1475
00:48:33,974 --> 00:48:35,033
These are the three photos combined.

1476
00:48:35,034 --> 00:48:36,103
(Jin Sun Kyu)

1477
00:48:36,104 --> 00:48:37,173
(Lee Jun Hyuk)

1478
00:48:37,174 --> 00:48:39,904
I couldn't see Woo Bin's face.

1479
00:48:40,074 --> 00:48:42,390
- I saw his facial features.
- I saw Jun Hyuk's face right away.

1480
00:48:42,414 --> 00:48:44,574
If 1 of them gets 1 right answer, he'll sleep indoors.

1481
00:48:45,544 --> 00:48:46,883
The current scores are...

1482
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:50,554
DinDin has 2 points, and Joon and Seon Ho have 1 point.

1483
00:48:51,024 --> 00:48:52,024
This question...

1484
00:48:52,624 --> 00:48:54,023
It's easy? Okay. Let's begin now.

1485
00:48:54,024 --> 00:48:55,424
- Okay.
- I'm so cold.

1486
00:48:55,554 --> 00:48:57,393
One... Jong Min, look here.

1487
00:48:57,394 --> 00:48:59,324
- Okay.
- One, two, three. Ta-da.

1488
00:49:03,194 --> 00:49:04,204
What is this?

1489
00:49:05,704 --> 00:49:07,234
(Who are they?)

1490
00:49:07,634 --> 00:49:08,634
- It's not easy.
- What is this?

1491
00:49:08,635 --> 00:49:09,934
(You said it was easy.)

1492
00:49:10,134 --> 00:49:11,603
- Who are they?
- I have absolutely no idea.

1493
00:49:11,604 --> 00:49:12,873
- I think I know the answer.
- I think I know who they are.

1494
00:49:12,874 --> 00:49:14,113
- I can't see any of them.
- I think I know.

1495
00:49:14,114 --> 00:49:15,274
I know who they are for sure.

1496
00:49:17,744 --> 00:49:18,944
- Se Yoon.
- Go ahead.

1497
00:49:19,384 --> 00:49:21,014
- Yangbaechu.
- That's right.

1498
00:49:21,654 --> 00:49:22,654
Go Eun Ae.

1499
00:49:24,084 --> 00:49:25,383
- Go Eun Ae?
- That's right.

1500
00:49:25,384 --> 00:49:26,730
(They wouldn't have included a cartoon character.)

1501
00:49:26,754 --> 00:49:27,894
And Moon Sang Hoon.

1502
00:49:28,654 --> 00:49:29,823
- Seon Ho.
- I mean...

1503
00:49:29,824 --> 00:49:31,493
- Incorrect.
- It's...

1504
00:49:31,494 --> 00:49:32,494
You got one right.

1505
00:49:32,495 --> 00:49:33,523
(One of them is the correct answer.)

1506
00:49:33,524 --> 00:49:35,263
One of them is Yangbaechu. I can see myself.

1507
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,264
(His photo appeared.)

1508
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,240
- I just can't see one person.
- Seriously, this is...

1509
00:49:38,264 --> 00:49:40,573
- Just one person.
- Go Eun Ae is...

1510
00:49:40,574 --> 00:49:42,574
- Joon.
- Go ahead.

1511
00:49:43,504 --> 00:49:45,274
Moon Se Yoon, Cho Sae Ho, and Lee Yeong Ja.

1512
00:49:46,744 --> 00:49:48,774
- He took a wild guess.
- He got two people right.

1513
00:49:49,044 --> 00:49:50,044
(Moon Se Yoon, Cho Sae Ho, Lee Yeong Ja)

1514
00:49:50,045 --> 00:49:51,084
Joon's answer is...

1515
00:49:51,444 --> 00:49:53,204
- My gosh. Are you serious?
- Is it correct?

1516
00:49:53,414 --> 00:49:54,554
Correct.

1517
00:49:54,814 --> 00:49:56,254
Why isn't Go Eun Ae one of them?

1518
00:49:57,924 --> 00:49:58,953
(The winner's grace)

1519
00:49:58,954 --> 00:49:59,954
Gosh, I'm so cold.

1520
00:50:02,094 --> 00:50:04,663
I know when that photo was taken.

1521
00:50:04,664 --> 00:50:06,193
That was taken...

1522
00:50:06,194 --> 00:50:08,164
when Se Yoon was dancing at the festival.

1523
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,504
(In Yeoju, Se Yoon's getting-off-work mission was...)

1524
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:14,304
(to dress up as Go Eun Ae, and he became Se Yoon Ae.)

1525
00:50:14,774 --> 00:50:16,003
(Moon Se Yoon)

1526
00:50:16,004 --> 00:50:17,103
(Cho Sae Ho)

1527
00:50:17,104 --> 00:50:18,173
(Lee Yeong Ja)

1528
00:50:18,174 --> 00:50:21,314
(Moon Se Yoon, Cho Sae Ho, Lee Yeong Ja)

1529
00:50:21,614 --> 00:50:23,014
Did you not recognize yourself?

1530
00:50:23,174 --> 00:50:25,584
I thought I was Yangbaechu.

1531
00:50:26,214 --> 00:50:28,384
I'll announce the current scores.

1532
00:50:29,214 --> 00:50:32,023
DinDin has 2 points. Joon has 2 points.

1533
00:50:32,024 --> 00:50:33,353
And Seon Ho has one point.

1534
00:50:33,354 --> 00:50:34,393
There's one spot left we can aim for.

1535
00:50:34,394 --> 00:50:37,263
We must get two questions right.

1536
00:50:37,264 --> 00:50:38,823
If you think about the probability,

1537
00:50:38,824 --> 00:50:39,994
we have to catch Seon Ho.

1538
00:50:40,394 --> 00:50:42,114
We have to drag him down and take his spot.

1539
00:50:42,764 --> 00:50:45,163
Considering the current scores, DinDin and Joon...

1540
00:50:45,164 --> 00:50:47,703
- don't really have to...
- We'll be safe with one more point.

1541
00:50:47,704 --> 00:50:49,273
- They'll be safe.
- No, they're winners for sure.

1542
00:50:49,274 --> 00:50:50,674
- For sure.
- The next question.

1543
00:50:51,444 --> 00:50:54,544
One, two, three. Ta-da.

1544
00:50:55,814 --> 00:50:57,183
(The game's result depends on this question.)

1545
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:58,184
Who are they?

1546
00:50:59,844 --> 00:51:01,413
- Who are they?
- Okay. Good.

1547
00:51:01,414 --> 00:51:03,514
- Who are they?
- Okay. I got it.

1548
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,494
- Se Yoon.
- Sae Ho.

1549
00:51:07,654 --> 00:51:08,694
Se Yoon.

1550
00:51:08,954 --> 00:51:10,054
Kim Seo Hyung.

1551
00:51:10,354 --> 00:51:11,494
Han Ji Hye.

1552
00:51:13,294 --> 00:51:14,294
Jang Do Yeon.

1553
00:51:15,564 --> 00:51:16,893
Incorrect. You got none right.

1554
00:51:16,894 --> 00:51:18,103
(There's no correct answer.)

1555
00:51:18,104 --> 00:51:20,973
(He's the least sharp-sighted member of 2 Days 1 Night.)

1556
00:51:20,974 --> 00:51:22,033
Joon.

1557
00:51:22,034 --> 00:51:23,503
(The difficulty level of the question is quite high.)

1558
00:51:23,504 --> 00:51:25,604
Tang Wei, Ju Ji Hoon, and Lee Young Ae.

1559
00:51:26,174 --> 00:51:27,274
Tang Wei?

1560
00:51:28,844 --> 00:51:30,443
- He got two right, I guess.
- I think his answer is correct.

1561
00:51:30,444 --> 00:51:31,483
(His answer must be correct.)

1562
00:51:31,484 --> 00:51:32,643
(Tang Wei, Ju Ji Hoon, Lee Young Ae)

1563
00:51:32,644 --> 00:51:34,413
- Incorrect. You got two right.
- Two?

1564
00:51:34,414 --> 00:51:35,414
Seon Ho.

1565
00:51:35,415 --> 00:51:36,984
Lee Young Ae, Ju Ji Hoon,

1566
00:51:37,354 --> 00:51:38,474
- and Cha Eun Woo.
- DinDin.

1567
00:51:38,854 --> 00:51:39,854
Incorrect. You got two right.

1568
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:41,695
- I see someone very handsome.
- Lee Young Ae.

1569
00:51:42,924 --> 00:51:45,863
(Who could be the last one?)

1570
00:51:45,864 --> 00:51:47,694
This male actor...

1571
00:51:48,164 --> 00:51:50,604
- was born in 1987.
- Oh, goodness.

1572
00:51:50,964 --> 00:51:53,133
Joon must know all the stars around his age.

1573
00:51:53,134 --> 00:51:54,834
- Who were born in 1987?
- Joon.

1574
00:51:55,704 --> 00:51:57,704
- If he fails, I'll give you a hint.
- Okay.

1575
00:51:58,404 --> 00:52:00,044
Lee Young Ae, Ju Ji Hoon, and Seo In Guk.

1576
00:52:00,304 --> 00:52:01,343
- Incorrect.
- Incorrect.

1577
00:52:01,344 --> 00:52:02,790
I'll just try saying the names of all those who were born in 1987.

1578
00:52:02,814 --> 00:52:04,413
- His recent movie.
- His recent movie?

1579
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:06,683
- Recently, he acted in "Harbin."
- Yes?

1580
00:52:06,684 --> 00:52:07,913
("Harbin")

1581
00:52:07,914 --> 00:52:08,953
(There's the answer among them.)

1582
00:52:08,954 --> 00:52:10,083
(Hyun Bin, Park Jeong Min, Jo Woo Jin, Jeon Yeo Been, )

1583
00:52:10,084 --> 00:52:11,323
(Director Woo Min Ho, Park Hoon, Yoo Jae Myung, Lee Dong Wook)

1584
00:52:11,324 --> 00:52:12,953
Who is he? I can't remember his name.

1585
00:52:12,954 --> 00:52:14,493
Joon! I know the answer!

1586
00:52:14,494 --> 00:52:16,330
- You can't try again consecutively.
- Wait for your turn.

1587
00:52:16,354 --> 00:52:17,563
- You can't try again now.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

1588
00:52:17,564 --> 00:52:18,564
(They're not allowed to try consecutively.)

1589
00:52:18,564 --> 00:52:19,564
Let's answer carefully.

1590
00:52:19,565 --> 00:52:20,933
- I got too excited.
- Let's answer carefully.

1591
00:52:20,934 --> 00:52:22,363
- Or else, Joon will succeed.
- This is...

1592
00:52:22,364 --> 00:52:24,703
Since Joon knows the answer,

1593
00:52:24,704 --> 00:52:26,224
let's not give him a chance to answer.

1594
00:52:26,664 --> 00:52:28,704
Don't let him answer. It'll be over if he succeeds.

1595
00:52:29,134 --> 00:52:30,134
An actor who was born in 1987.

1596
00:52:30,135 --> 00:52:31,574
It's so easy. It's a piece of cake.

1597
00:52:31,874 --> 00:52:33,744
He and I have a one-year age gap.

1598
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:36,514
- DinDin.
- No. You can't afford to fail.

1599
00:52:36,944 --> 00:52:38,860
- DinDin, go ahead.
- It's over if you fail now.

1600
00:52:38,884 --> 00:52:40,144
- Go ahead.
- I'll pass.

1601
00:52:41,254 --> 00:52:42,984
- Joon.
- Go ahead.

1602
00:52:43,084 --> 00:52:44,824
Joon, let us try a few times.

1603
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,053
Joon can try again now that I gave up my turn.

1604
00:52:47,054 --> 00:52:48,724
Joon, give us a chance.

1605
00:52:48,924 --> 00:52:51,323
- I'll give you a chance.
- Really?

1606
00:52:51,324 --> 00:52:53,523
- Just 1 chance to 1 person.
- Just 1 person?

1607
00:52:53,524 --> 00:52:54,594
(Still, Joon is the best.)

1608
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:57,963
- Se Yoon.
- I think he knows exactly.

1609
00:52:57,964 --> 00:52:59,633
I'm not sure, though. I'll answer anyway.

1610
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,703
Lee Young Ae, Ju Ji Hoon,

1611
00:53:00,704 --> 00:53:02,573
(Lee Young Ae, Ju Ji Hoon)

1612
00:53:02,574 --> 00:53:03,734
and Park Jeong Min.

1613
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:06,474
You can sit.

1614
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:07,914
- Se Yoon.
- Did he really get it?

1615
00:53:08,214 --> 00:53:10,313
- He said his answer.
- Park Jeong Min.

1616
00:53:10,314 --> 00:53:11,383
That is correct.

1617
00:53:11,384 --> 00:53:12,384
(Deeply moved)

1618
00:53:12,584 --> 00:53:15,083
(Se Yoon got it for the first time.)

1619
00:53:15,084 --> 00:53:17,113
- Okay. Thanks, Joon.
- How did he see that?

1620
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:18,383
Thank you. I got this.

1621
00:53:18,384 --> 00:53:20,154
How did he know that it had Park Jeong Min?

1622
00:53:20,324 --> 00:53:21,494
That's right. Park Jeong Min.

1623
00:53:21,894 --> 00:53:24,093
- Jeong Min, I'm sorry.
- I couldn't tell at all.

1624
00:53:24,094 --> 00:53:25,094
I almost...

1625
00:53:25,694 --> 00:53:28,693
(Ju Ji Hoon, Park Jeong Min, Lee Young Ae)

1626
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:33,503
- So 1 point each, and 2 points...
- Right, it's 1 and 2.

1627
00:53:33,504 --> 00:53:35,533
Okay. Then we have to get the next two questions right.

1628
00:53:35,534 --> 00:53:36,673
Otherwise, we have to sleep outside.

1629
00:53:36,674 --> 00:53:38,503
- You didn't get any?
- No.

1630
00:53:38,504 --> 00:53:39,603
Okay.

1631
00:53:39,604 --> 00:53:41,343
I got this. I'm okay now.

1632
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:42,774
What if I lose at this rate?

1633
00:53:43,614 --> 00:53:45,814
- Let's start.
- I shouldn't have let him.

1634
00:53:45,944 --> 00:53:46,944
I'm all nervous now.

1635
00:53:47,854 --> 00:53:50,584
One, two, three. Ta-da.

1636
00:53:54,954 --> 00:53:56,993
Goodness, I think I got it. Hold on.

1637
00:53:56,994 --> 00:53:58,494
(1 point means a lot to Se Yoon.)

1638
00:53:58,924 --> 00:53:59,924
(The losing members still have no clue.)

1639
00:53:59,925 --> 00:54:01,070
I think I can tell two people.

1640
00:54:01,094 --> 00:54:02,264
I got two people too.

1641
00:54:02,664 --> 00:54:03,664
DinDin will have a go.

1642
00:54:03,664 --> 00:54:04,664
(DinDin is having a go.)

1643
00:54:04,665 --> 00:54:07,004
- DinDin. Jang Do Yeon, - Okay.

1644
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:08,974
Park Mi Sun,

1645
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:10,743
and Shim Eun Kyung.

1646
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:12,664
- Right, Shim Eun Kyung's there.
- That's wrong.

1647
00:54:13,474 --> 00:54:14,743
- Incorrect.
- Two people.

1648
00:54:14,744 --> 00:54:15,913
Two people he mentioned are correct.

1649
00:54:15,914 --> 00:54:17,383
I think Do Yeon and Eun Kyung are there in the picture.

1650
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:18,813
I can tell that those two are there.

1651
00:54:18,814 --> 00:54:19,814
(They are sure Do Yeon and Eun Kyung are there.)

1652
00:54:19,815 --> 00:54:21,053
- Jong Min.
- Yes.

1653
00:54:21,054 --> 00:54:24,153
Shim Eun Kyung, Jang Do Yeon, and Shim Eun Ha.

1654
00:54:24,154 --> 00:54:25,353
(Shim Eun Kyung, Jang Do Yeon, Shim Eun Ha)

1655
00:54:25,354 --> 00:54:26,753
- Incorrect.
- Joon.

1656
00:54:26,754 --> 00:54:30,153
- Joon.
- Eun Kyung, Do Yeon, and Ji Min.

1657
00:54:30,154 --> 00:54:31,263
(Shim Eun Kyung, Jang Do Yeon, Han Ji Min)

1658
00:54:31,264 --> 00:54:32,264
That must be the answer.

1659
00:54:32,265 --> 00:54:33,363
(It's correct.)

1660
00:54:33,364 --> 00:54:34,364
- Goodness, did he get it?
- Is this for real?

1661
00:54:34,365 --> 00:54:35,763
So are you sleeping indoors?

1662
00:54:35,764 --> 00:54:37,293
(He will get to sleep inside if this is correct.)

1663
00:54:37,294 --> 00:54:38,533
- He is sleeping indoors.
- That is correct.

1664
00:54:38,534 --> 00:54:39,604
(Joon got the answer.)

1665
00:54:39,864 --> 00:54:42,174
(They still earned 0 points.)

1666
00:54:42,604 --> 00:54:44,773
(Joon is sleeping indoors for sure.)

1667
00:54:44,774 --> 00:54:46,150
(Joon 3 points, DinDin 2 points, Seon Ho 1 point, Se Yoon 1 point)

1668
00:54:46,174 --> 00:54:47,343
(Shim Eun Kyung)

1669
00:54:47,344 --> 00:54:48,573
(Jang Do Yeon)

1670
00:54:48,574 --> 00:54:49,574
(Han Ji Min)

1671
00:54:52,784 --> 00:54:54,584
- So is it the last question?
- That's right.

1672
00:54:54,914 --> 00:54:55,914
The last question?

1673
00:54:56,014 --> 00:54:58,183
So Jong Min and I don't have to do this.

1674
00:54:58,184 --> 00:54:59,323
(Can we give up?)

1675
00:54:59,324 --> 00:55:01,330
- I don't want to get wet anymore.
- We don't need to do this.

1676
00:55:01,354 --> 00:55:02,594
We can just sit here then.

1677
00:55:03,124 --> 00:55:04,923
- DinDin and I can...
- No, you still have a chance.

1678
00:55:04,924 --> 00:55:05,993
- It's cold. Let's do it.
- There's a chance.

1679
00:55:05,994 --> 00:55:07,863
- You still have a chance.
- It will be a tie if you play.

1680
00:55:07,864 --> 00:55:09,933
- You, Seon Ho, and me?
- We only have one point each.

1681
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:12,833
You can proceed to the finals if you get this one right.

1682
00:55:12,834 --> 00:55:13,963
- That's right.
- Okay.

1683
00:55:13,964 --> 00:55:14,973
(Those who have 1 point can proceed to the finals.)

1684
00:55:14,974 --> 00:55:16,710
- That's right.
- I'm sleeping inside, right?

1685
00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:19,543
- Yes.
- They don't have to play then.

1686
00:55:19,544 --> 00:55:20,544
(Those with higher scores are exempted from this round.)

1687
00:55:20,545 --> 00:55:23,214
- All right. Let's go.
- I can see two people...

1688
00:55:23,714 --> 00:55:26,644
One, two, three. Ta-da.

1689
00:55:31,884 --> 00:55:33,353
Gosh, this one is tough.

1690
00:55:33,354 --> 00:55:34,530
(They still have hope if they get this one right.)

1691
00:55:34,554 --> 00:55:35,754
I can only see one person.

1692
00:55:36,154 --> 00:55:37,524
I see one person too.

1693
00:55:37,924 --> 00:55:38,963
Me too.

1694
00:55:38,964 --> 00:55:40,593
(Most of them can tell this one person.)

1695
00:55:40,594 --> 00:55:43,364
Whose beard is that?

1696
00:55:44,264 --> 00:55:47,164
(The one with the beard is drawing attention)

1697
00:55:47,704 --> 00:55:49,803
(Frustrated)

1698
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,704
The hair is...

1699
00:55:52,874 --> 00:55:54,544
Who is that actor?

1700
00:55:55,544 --> 00:55:56,814
You have to guess that.

1701
00:55:57,714 --> 00:56:00,213
- This is driving me crazy.
- You have to guess that.

1702
00:56:00,214 --> 00:56:01,754
You know that actor...

1703
00:56:03,184 --> 00:56:04,984
(We can splash the water.)

1704
00:56:05,354 --> 00:56:07,324
(Okay, I got it.)

1705
00:56:07,854 --> 00:56:09,223
(They have no idea what is happening in the back.)

1706
00:56:09,224 --> 00:56:10,323
Is that even a beard?

1707
00:56:10,324 --> 00:56:12,493
Can you tell who this person is with this wide hair?

1708
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,163
I think I can. You should go first.

1709
00:56:14,164 --> 00:56:16,333
- I'm not sure.
- Jong Min!

1710
00:56:16,334 --> 00:56:17,540
(Jong Min finally learns how to play this game.)

1711
00:56:17,564 --> 00:56:19,434
(Did he sense something?)

1712
00:56:19,934 --> 00:56:21,104
Shin Gi Ru.

1713
00:56:22,304 --> 00:56:23,534
- Three.
- Cho Jin Woong.

1714
00:56:23,834 --> 00:56:25,273
- Two.
- Ryu Hyun Jin.

1715
00:56:25,274 --> 00:56:26,473
(Shin Gi Ru, Cho Jin Woong, Ryu Hyun Jin)

1716
00:56:26,474 --> 00:56:27,914
- Two people are right.
- Incorrect.

1717
00:56:28,214 --> 00:56:29,343
- Two people are right.
- Incorrect.

1718
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,513
So it was Cho Jin Woong.

1719
00:56:30,514 --> 00:56:31,843
- He got one person right.
- One person?

1720
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:32,844
- That's all?
- What?

1721
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,484
I'm sure it's Shin Gi Ru.

1722
00:56:36,454 --> 00:56:37,823
Who is that person with curly hair?

1723
00:56:37,824 --> 00:56:39,944
(The one with curly hair that Seon Ho isn't aware of)

1724
00:56:42,154 --> 00:56:44,764
(Shin Gi Ru)

1725
00:56:44,994 --> 00:56:46,824
Se Yoon. It's Shin Gi Ru and Choi Hong Man.

1726
00:56:47,664 --> 00:56:48,993
- Is it...
- And...

1727
00:56:48,994 --> 00:56:49,994
(He's getting surprised as he says the names.)

1728
00:56:49,995 --> 00:56:53,833
- It's Choi Hong Man.
- Three, two, one.

1729
00:56:53,834 --> 00:56:55,073
Two people are correct.

1730
00:56:55,074 --> 00:56:56,434
- Incorrect.
- All right.

1731
00:56:56,474 --> 00:56:57,503
You got two people right.

1732
00:56:57,504 --> 00:56:58,880
(Shin Gi Ru and Choi Hong Man are correct.)

1733
00:56:58,904 --> 00:57:01,114
(Here is the answer.)

1734
00:57:05,684 --> 00:57:08,713
(Shin Gi Ru, Choi Hong Man, Lee Joon)

1735
00:57:08,714 --> 00:57:11,284
(Whoever guesses Joon is the winner.)

1736
00:57:11,684 --> 00:57:14,084
(They're getting tired as they are waiting for a long time.)

1737
00:57:14,124 --> 00:57:15,254
Give us a hint.

1738
00:57:16,594 --> 00:57:18,423
You know this actor very well.

1739
00:57:18,424 --> 00:57:20,323
(We all know this actor.)

1740
00:57:20,324 --> 00:57:22,534
- We know him so well.
- Jong Min.

1741
00:57:23,134 --> 00:57:24,464
- Shin Gi Ru.
- Right.

1742
00:57:24,604 --> 00:57:26,764
- And Choi Hong Man.
- Right.

1743
00:57:27,134 --> 00:57:28,773
And it's Zo In Sung.

1744
00:57:28,774 --> 00:57:30,273
(Shin Gi Ru, Choi Hong Man, Zo In Sung)

1745
00:57:30,274 --> 00:57:31,520
Incorrect! You got two people right.

1746
00:57:31,544 --> 00:57:32,604
Se Yoon.

1747
00:57:32,844 --> 00:57:34,674
Shin Gi Ru, Choi Hong Man,

1748
00:57:36,174 --> 00:57:37,214
Cho Seung Woo.

1749
00:57:38,184 --> 00:57:39,213
Incorrect, you got two people right.

1750
00:57:39,214 --> 00:57:40,954
- Is it a male actor?
- Yes.

1751
00:57:41,184 --> 00:57:42,483
(Was my hint too difficult?)

1752
00:57:42,484 --> 00:57:43,514
Can't you tell?

1753
00:57:43,584 --> 00:57:45,024
This person...

1754
00:57:45,354 --> 00:57:46,483
was born in 1988.

1755
00:57:46,484 --> 00:57:48,123
(Joon was born in 1988.)

1756
00:57:48,124 --> 00:57:49,284
This person was born in 1988.

1757
00:57:49,654 --> 00:57:50,823
- Jong Min.
- Sae Ho.

1758
00:57:50,824 --> 00:57:51,824
Seon Ho.

1759
00:57:51,825 --> 00:57:52,964
Shin Gi Ru,

1760
00:57:53,764 --> 00:57:54,893
Choi Hong Man,

1761
00:57:54,894 --> 00:57:56,133
- and Choi Woo Shik.
- Seon Ho.

1762
00:57:56,134 --> 00:57:57,194
Seon Ho.

1763
00:57:57,394 --> 00:57:59,134
Seon Ho!

1764
00:58:00,004 --> 00:58:02,603
(He has no idea that it's him.)

1765
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:05,003
Choi Hong Man, Shin Gi Ru, and Lee Joon.

1766
00:58:05,004 --> 00:58:06,503
(Choi Hong Man, Shin Gi Ru, Lee Joon)

1767
00:58:06,504 --> 00:58:09,614
That is incorrect. There is no way they would include Joon here.

1768
00:58:10,044 --> 00:58:11,044
That just makes no sense.

1769
00:58:11,044 --> 00:58:12,044
(Even he can't believe this.)

1770
00:58:12,045 --> 00:58:13,283
- Is this for real?
- That is correct.

1771
00:58:13,284 --> 00:58:14,284
I'm there?

1772
00:58:14,285 --> 00:58:15,914
(Seon Ho is sleeping indoors.)

1773
00:58:17,754 --> 00:58:19,284
(Why are you there?)

1774
00:58:19,724 --> 00:58:21,424
(I am in the wrong seat.)

1775
00:58:22,224 --> 00:58:23,924
(I'll make you feel cool, Se Yoon.)

1776
00:58:25,024 --> 00:58:26,024
(Se Yoon's SUMMERSWAG)

1777
00:58:26,025 --> 00:58:27,394
Gosh, it's so cold!

1778
00:58:28,194 --> 00:58:31,964
(That's 3 times more water thanks to DinDin.)

1779
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:34,503
(Having mixed feelings)

1780
00:58:34,504 --> 00:58:35,674
I'm there?

1781
00:58:35,934 --> 00:58:37,003
I can't tell at all.

1782
00:58:37,004 --> 00:58:38,004
(He still can't believe it.)

1783
00:58:38,005 --> 00:58:39,603
So Joon was in the picture.

1784
00:58:39,604 --> 00:58:41,524
(His dream of sleeping indoors is gone in vain.)

1785
00:58:43,514 --> 00:58:46,014
(DinDin is comforting Se Yoon who is feeling sad.)

1786
00:58:46,344 --> 00:58:48,413
(It's so much fun.)

1787
00:58:48,414 --> 00:58:51,053
Joon is really shining tonight.

1788
00:58:51,054 --> 00:58:52,054
Right.

1789
00:58:52,254 --> 00:58:53,723
Joon is very good at this game.

1790
00:58:53,724 --> 00:58:55,553
Joon is amazing.

1791
00:58:55,554 --> 00:58:56,914
It's about time we slept outdoors.

1792
00:58:57,154 --> 00:58:58,363
Here is the final score.

1793
00:58:58,364 --> 00:58:59,463
(The result of Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors)

1794
00:58:59,464 --> 00:59:00,523
You are sleeping outdoors.

1795
00:59:00,524 --> 00:59:02,694
Don't do this. We are the three oldest ones here.

1796
00:59:02,964 --> 00:59:04,093
Don't do this.

1797
00:59:04,094 --> 00:59:05,534
- I can't see.
- We can't even see.

1798
00:59:05,804 --> 00:59:06,933
- All right.
- But this was fun.

1799
00:59:06,934 --> 00:59:09,374
You all worked very hard today.

1800
00:59:09,704 --> 00:59:11,943
We don't have any Morning Missions tomorrow.

1801
00:59:11,944 --> 00:59:13,864
- You can sleep comfortably.
- Really? How come?

1802
00:59:13,974 --> 00:59:16,044
So you are just taking Se Yoon?

1803
00:59:16,144 --> 00:59:17,144
That's nice.

1804
00:59:17,544 --> 00:59:20,024
- I'll go there by myself.
- We have something in the morning.

1805
00:59:20,084 --> 00:59:23,713
But it won't happen right after you get up.

1806
00:59:23,714 --> 00:59:25,854
Today is like a legendary day. Look at the time now.

1807
00:59:26,154 --> 00:59:28,394
- We can sleep right away.
- It's 11pm.

1808
00:59:29,254 --> 00:59:30,254
It's amazing.

1809
00:59:30,255 --> 00:59:32,393
- We never finished this early.
- What's happening?

1810
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:33,700
I can go running when I get home tomorrow.

1811
00:59:33,724 --> 00:59:35,404
Let's play one more game. I'm anxious now.

1812
00:59:35,934 --> 00:59:37,293
- Is this even okay?
- Of course.

1813
00:59:37,294 --> 00:59:39,363
- You can sleep comfortably.
- We've never finished this early.

1814
00:59:39,364 --> 00:59:41,403
- Sleep tight.
- Thank you. Good night.

1815
00:59:41,404 --> 00:59:42,834
Goodness, thank you.

1816
00:59:43,234 --> 00:59:46,443
- Good night.
- Today has been amazing.

1817
00:59:46,444 --> 00:59:48,113
Gosh, it's so nice here.

1818
00:59:48,114 --> 00:59:50,074
The three of us have never slept together before.

1819
00:59:50,214 --> 00:59:51,384
It feels weird.

1820
00:59:52,784 --> 00:59:54,583
So Joon wasn't the problem.

1821
00:59:54,584 --> 00:59:56,284
- No, it's Se Yoon.
- Thank you, Joon.

1822
00:59:56,684 --> 00:59:58,183
It's not my fault!

1823
00:59:58,184 --> 00:59:59,454
Se Yoon lost in all games.

1824
00:59:59,724 --> 01:00:01,153
So what do you think your ranking is?

1825
01:00:01,154 --> 01:00:03,254
In terms of overall ability.

1826
01:00:04,464 --> 01:00:05,593
- I'm in sixth place.
- What?

1827
01:00:05,594 --> 01:00:07,933
- In sixth place.
- Are you the Defeat Fairy?

1828
01:00:07,934 --> 01:00:09,864
You beat me in ssireum.

1829
01:00:10,264 --> 01:00:11,264
You are right.

1830
01:00:11,265 --> 01:00:12,563
- He got it.
- Attack him from the inside.

1831
01:00:12,564 --> 01:00:15,633
(Fashion Muscle lost to Paper Doll.)

1832
01:00:15,634 --> 01:00:17,974
We are sleeping indoors, at least.

1833
01:00:18,404 --> 01:00:19,474
Good night.

1834
01:00:19,944 --> 01:00:21,213
Let's sleep for tomorrow.

1835
01:00:21,214 --> 01:00:22,573
(Good night, Unofficial Defeat Fairy Joon.)

1836
01:00:22,574 --> 01:00:24,744
Come inside now. Bugs will come in.

1837
01:00:25,484 --> 01:00:26,713
Are you telling me to come inside?

1838
01:00:26,714 --> 01:00:27,983
(Driving bugs out in the dark)

1839
01:00:27,984 --> 01:00:29,313
You can close the bottom.

1840
01:00:29,314 --> 01:00:31,583
- We can't sleep with the bugs.
- That's right.

1841
01:00:31,584 --> 01:00:32,723
(Jong Min is the tent guard for the night.)

1842
01:00:32,724 --> 01:00:35,223
Yesterday, the sun came up at 5am.

1843
01:00:35,224 --> 01:00:36,823
It will be really hot.

1844
01:00:36,824 --> 01:00:37,824
(It's not easy to sleep outdoors during summer.)

1845
01:00:37,825 --> 01:00:40,223
We are clearly not sharp-sighted anymore.

1846
01:00:40,224 --> 01:00:41,763
I couldn't see it at all.

1847
01:00:41,764 --> 01:00:42,764
I was so good at this before.

1848
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:44,565
- Let's not play this kind of game.
- I know.

1849
01:00:45,034 --> 01:00:47,803
I was so good at it when I was young.

1850
01:00:47,804 --> 01:00:49,274
I know. I was so good.

1851
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:50,704
I was like an expert.

1852
01:00:51,244 --> 01:00:52,244
Good night.

1853
01:00:52,245 --> 01:00:53,603
All right. You all did a good job.

1854
01:00:53,604 --> 01:00:55,250
(Let's sleep early so Se Yoon gets the penalty tomorrow.)

1855
01:00:55,274 --> 01:00:58,084
(Falling asleep to the frog noises as their lullaby)

1856
01:01:00,784 --> 01:01:04,554
(The morning arrives as it always does.)

1857
01:01:05,384 --> 01:01:07,894
(The tent strikes them while they are still asleep.)

1858
01:01:08,554 --> 01:01:11,324
(But he's still soundly asleep.)

1859
01:01:12,094 --> 01:01:14,994
(Jong Min wakes up as the birds chirp.)

1860
01:01:15,294 --> 01:01:16,463
I was so lucky.

1861
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,533
(Sae Ho is there as the 1st one.)

1862
01:01:17,534 --> 01:01:19,333
(Team Indoors is up too.)

1863
01:01:19,334 --> 01:01:20,733
- Good morning.
- Hey, good morning.

1864
01:01:20,734 --> 01:01:21,804
- Good morning.
- Hello.

1865
01:01:22,104 --> 01:01:23,933
- Did you all sleep well?
- Yes.

1866
01:01:23,934 --> 01:01:25,504
- I slept so well.
- Near here,

1867
01:01:25,704 --> 01:01:28,814
there's a famous local restaurant that only opens until lunchtime.

1868
01:01:29,774 --> 01:01:30,974
Just until lunchtime?

1869
01:01:31,384 --> 01:01:32,560
That must be a good restaurant.

1870
01:01:32,584 --> 01:01:34,653
We'll be having breakfast.

1871
01:01:34,654 --> 01:01:35,654
(Providing breakfast after a long time)

1872
01:01:35,655 --> 01:01:36,813
I guess we will play a game.

1873
01:01:36,814 --> 01:01:38,083
- I guess we will.
- But still...

1874
01:01:38,084 --> 01:01:39,084
(I still like the idea.)

1875
01:01:39,085 --> 01:01:40,954
- Let's get going.
- Okay.

1876
01:01:41,024 --> 01:01:42,694
- Let's go.
- That's nice.

1877
01:01:43,594 --> 01:01:46,164
The wind must have been really nice yesterday.

1878
01:01:46,264 --> 01:01:48,663
Can't you tell us the menu?

1879
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:49,793
- I'm getting excited.
- Se Yoon.

1880
01:01:49,794 --> 01:01:51,233
How can they close after lunch hours?

1881
01:01:51,234 --> 01:01:52,263
We're going after soup.

1882
01:01:52,264 --> 01:01:53,404
- Soup?
- Okay.

1883
01:01:53,804 --> 01:01:55,504
That must be a famous restaurant.

1884
01:01:55,774 --> 01:01:57,673
- Don't you think it's soft tofu?
- It sounds nice.

1885
01:01:57,674 --> 01:01:59,073
- Soft tofu?
- Soft tofu is...

1886
01:01:59,074 --> 01:02:01,214
I think it must be soft tofu.

1887
01:02:01,274 --> 01:02:02,274
Do you see it?

1888
01:02:03,514 --> 01:02:05,843
- I want to have moray eels.
- We're having moray eels.

1889
01:02:05,844 --> 01:02:07,143
Moray eel soup is delicious.

1890
01:02:07,144 --> 01:02:08,430
Moray eels are famous here in Gangwon Province.

1891
01:02:08,454 --> 01:02:10,184
- But it's ugly.
- Is it?

1892
01:02:10,554 --> 01:02:11,824
(Glancing)

1893
01:02:13,054 --> 01:02:14,823
You look like a moray eel.

1894
01:02:14,824 --> 01:02:16,904
- Moray eels are strong.
- Doesn't he look like one?

1895
01:02:17,124 --> 01:02:18,563
That's so rude.

1896
01:02:18,564 --> 01:02:20,723
A lot of the locals come here...

1897
01:02:20,724 --> 01:02:22,393
as well as the tourists.

1898
01:02:22,394 --> 01:02:23,993
It has been open for 35 years.

1899
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:26,204
- Gosh, 35 years?
- Open for 35 years?

1900
01:02:26,904 --> 01:02:28,804
This place is famous for its moray eel soup.

1901
01:02:29,104 --> 01:02:31,243
- It's really refreshing.
- I want to have it.

1902
01:02:31,244 --> 01:02:33,103
It's so soft that it melts in your mouth like pudding.

1903
01:02:33,104 --> 01:02:34,144
Really?

1904
01:02:35,644 --> 01:02:36,713
Not everyone can have it...

1905
01:02:36,714 --> 01:02:39,083
- as per our show's concept.
- That's right.

1906
01:02:39,084 --> 01:02:40,784
We'll play a simple random game.

1907
01:02:40,914 --> 01:02:42,590
We will pick the ones who get to have breakfast.

1908
01:02:42,614 --> 01:02:44,724
- I thought everyone was having it.
- No.

1909
01:02:44,984 --> 01:02:47,583
- How about we all agree...
- Yes?

1910
01:02:47,584 --> 01:02:50,393
To let Se Yoon have breakfast...

1911
01:02:50,394 --> 01:02:52,593
because he has to do his Defeat Fairy job.

1912
01:02:52,594 --> 01:02:53,594
Can we do that? No, right?

1913
01:02:53,595 --> 01:02:54,864
Stop it with your funwashing.

1914
01:02:56,434 --> 01:02:58,233
- Are you a laundromat or what?
- That's a shame.

1915
01:02:58,234 --> 01:02:59,833
(Sae Ho failed with his funwashing.)

1916
01:02:59,834 --> 01:03:02,104
- Bring it in.
- I see what it is.

1917
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,004
- What's that?
- What's that?

1918
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:06,843
- Why are there so many plates?
- Why are there so many plates?

1919
01:03:06,844 --> 01:03:08,073
What is that?

1920
01:03:08,074 --> 01:03:09,873
You've heard of Chodang soft tofu, right?

1921
01:03:09,874 --> 01:03:10,874
- Yes.
- Yes.

1922
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:12,643
It's a specialty and symbol of Gangneung,

1923
01:03:12,644 --> 01:03:15,714
so much that there's even a Chodang Soft Tofu Village.

1924
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:19,023
Today's breakfast mission...

1925
01:03:19,024 --> 01:03:20,854
is soft tofu delivery.

1926
01:03:21,794 --> 01:03:24,793
You must safely deliver the soft tofu.

1927
01:03:24,794 --> 01:03:26,923
For convenience, we will use store-bought soft tofu...

1928
01:03:26,924 --> 01:03:29,733
- instead of Chodang soft tofu.
- Okay.

1929
01:03:29,734 --> 01:03:31,863
The tool you'll each use to deliver the soft tofu...

1930
01:03:31,864 --> 01:03:33,934
will be chosen randomly.

1931
01:03:34,774 --> 01:03:36,203
Did you put things like toothpicks?

1932
01:03:36,204 --> 01:03:39,003
The three people who move the most amount of soft tofu...

1933
01:03:39,004 --> 01:03:41,473
will be given a refreshing breakfast...

1934
01:03:41,474 --> 01:03:44,344
with Chodang soft tofu.

1935
01:03:44,544 --> 01:03:46,743
I really want to eat this.

1936
01:03:46,744 --> 01:03:48,413
- Goodness.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1937
01:03:48,414 --> 01:03:50,013
- Who will go first?
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1938
01:03:50,014 --> 01:03:51,054
Rock-paper-scissors.

1939
01:03:51,324 --> 01:03:52,623
- Okay.
- Okay.

1940
01:03:52,624 --> 01:03:54,023
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1941
01:03:54,024 --> 01:03:55,823
- Last, 5th, 4th...
- He's the 4th.

1942
01:03:55,824 --> 01:03:56,994
Go, Joon.

1943
01:03:57,794 --> 01:03:59,993
I really want to eat this. Why am I so hungry?

1944
01:03:59,994 --> 01:04:01,634
Joon said this yesterday.

1945
01:04:01,894 --> 01:04:03,464
He gets mad at himself...

1946
01:04:03,764 --> 01:04:05,803
because he's so bad at games.

1947
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:07,303
He gets mad at himself.

1948
01:04:07,304 --> 01:04:09,373
- He gets angry at himself.
- That's possible.

1949
01:04:09,374 --> 01:04:11,943
- Lee Joon.
- Toothpick, please!

1950
01:04:11,944 --> 01:04:13,543
I'll go with number 1 because I'll be in 1st place.

1951
01:04:13,544 --> 01:04:16,643
- Okay. One, two, three.
- Will you be first?

1952
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,044
It's not my fault!

1953
01:04:18,744 --> 01:04:20,443
- What is this?
- One-meter chopsticks.

1954
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:22,383
- Chopsticks.
- That's good.

1955
01:04:22,384 --> 01:04:23,783
- What?
- I don't know.

1956
01:04:23,784 --> 01:04:25,884
- What is this?
- It's good.

1957
01:04:25,954 --> 01:04:27,183
I have to win.

1958
01:04:27,184 --> 01:04:28,424
(He's given the 1m chopsticks.)

1959
01:04:28,524 --> 01:04:30,593
- This won't work.
- Also,

1960
01:04:30,594 --> 01:04:32,464
you have to hold it behind the red line.

1961
01:04:33,194 --> 01:04:34,763
Right.

1962
01:04:34,764 --> 01:04:35,793
Hold on.

1963
01:04:35,794 --> 01:04:36,933
- That's enough.
- It's enough.

1964
01:04:36,934 --> 01:04:38,734
- You chose it well.
- It's great.

1965
01:04:38,804 --> 01:04:40,933
I've improved already. Look.

1966
01:04:40,934 --> 01:04:42,003
That's good.

1967
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:44,333
He has a good chance since it's sturdy.

1968
01:04:44,334 --> 01:04:46,643
- I'll go.
- It's not easy.

1969
01:04:46,644 --> 01:04:48,013
You have to move it once you have it.

1970
01:04:48,014 --> 01:04:49,073
(Shaking)

1971
01:04:49,074 --> 01:04:50,743
- Ninja.
- Ninja.

1972
01:04:50,744 --> 01:04:52,183
It's breaking.

1973
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:53,213
Why does it break so easily?

1974
01:04:53,214 --> 01:04:54,783
It will break the moment it goes up.

1975
01:04:54,784 --> 01:04:56,153
It will break when it goes up.

1976
01:04:56,154 --> 01:04:57,413
It will break since it's weak.

1977
01:04:57,414 --> 01:05:00,183
You'll be teased by the people at the gym.

1978
01:05:00,184 --> 01:05:01,324
Why are you so bad?

1979
01:05:02,294 --> 01:05:03,493
Are the chopsticks heavy?

1980
01:05:03,494 --> 01:05:05,323
- Why are you so bad?
- Why are you so bad?

1981
01:05:05,324 --> 01:05:06,794
I have a weak mind.

1982
01:05:07,024 --> 01:05:09,463
Let me please eat this once.

1983
01:05:09,464 --> 01:05:10,733
It worked.

1984
01:05:10,734 --> 01:05:12,203
If it presses down...

1985
01:05:12,204 --> 01:05:13,533
If it presses down...

1986
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:14,703
(He held it!)

1987
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:15,874
Go back.

1988
01:05:16,674 --> 01:05:17,773
Go back.

1989
01:05:17,774 --> 01:05:19,743
(It slides and falls.)

1990
01:05:19,744 --> 01:05:20,773
(He's disappointed.)

1991
01:05:20,774 --> 01:05:22,074
I can't hold it.

1992
01:05:22,214 --> 01:05:24,173
This...

1993
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:25,284
(It's slides again.)

1994
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:27,043
Come on.

1995
01:05:27,044 --> 01:05:28,913
- It breaks so easily.
- Lee Joon.

1996
01:05:28,914 --> 01:05:31,983
Don't be greedy. Move a small amount.

1997
01:05:31,984 --> 01:05:33,053
Ten seconds!

1998
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:35,014
(He changes his strategy to move a small amount.)

1999
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:36,854
(Running)

2000
01:05:38,194 --> 01:05:40,863
- He moved a lot.
- Let me see.

2001
01:05:40,864 --> 01:05:41,933
I might get a cramp.

2002
01:05:41,934 --> 01:05:42,993
When you keep doing it...

2003
01:05:42,994 --> 01:05:44,463
- You moved a lot.
- It hurts so much.

2004
01:05:44,464 --> 01:05:47,103
- He moved a lot.
- I have a chance.

2005
01:05:47,104 --> 01:05:48,933
- It's 21.4g.
- Let's see.

2006
01:05:48,934 --> 01:05:50,003
It's 21.4g.

2007
01:05:50,004 --> 01:05:51,304
It's harder than you think.

2008
01:05:51,644 --> 01:05:52,843
- Really?
- It breaks so easily.

2009
01:05:52,844 --> 01:05:55,544
Next. The second player, Moon Se Yoon.

2010
01:05:55,644 --> 01:05:57,013
I was the Defeat Fairy yesterday.

2011
01:05:57,014 --> 01:05:59,013
But I got out of it.

2012
01:05:59,014 --> 01:06:01,013
- So I'll choose number five.
- One, two, three!

2013
01:06:01,014 --> 01:06:02,084
There!

2014
01:06:03,054 --> 01:06:04,384
What's a handmade spoon?

2015
01:06:05,484 --> 01:06:07,123
- Handmade spoon?
- It's a spoon.

2016
01:06:07,124 --> 01:06:08,353
What's a handmade spoon?

2017
01:06:08,354 --> 01:06:10,223
That's really nice. What's that?

2018
01:06:10,224 --> 01:06:11,463
That's a hanger.

2019
01:06:11,464 --> 01:06:13,763
- That will never work.
- That's the worst.

2020
01:06:13,764 --> 01:06:14,793
(He is given the handmade spoon.)

2021
01:06:14,794 --> 01:06:17,533
- What is this?
- Joon moved it a lot.

2022
01:06:17,534 --> 01:06:19,603
- Handmade...
- What is this?

2023
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:20,664
How do I use this?

2024
01:06:20,764 --> 01:06:21,833
(Laughing)

2025
01:06:21,834 --> 01:06:23,503
- How do I use this?
- What is that?

2026
01:06:23,504 --> 01:06:25,673
I can't control it even when I'm standing still.

2027
01:06:25,674 --> 01:06:27,273
This is impossible.

2028
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,273
Mine was better. This is just the worst.

2029
01:06:29,274 --> 01:06:31,243
I think you'll just have to buy food after this is over.

2030
01:06:31,244 --> 01:06:32,914
Moon Se Yoon, go.

2031
01:06:33,284 --> 01:06:35,013
(Focusing)

2032
01:06:35,014 --> 01:06:36,414
(Digging)

2033
01:06:36,884 --> 01:06:38,283
(He boldly digs in with the spoon.)

2034
01:06:38,284 --> 01:06:39,483
He stabbed it like a fork.

2035
01:06:39,484 --> 01:06:40,753
You only have one chance.

2036
01:06:40,754 --> 01:06:43,023
It's better to move at least a small amount.

2037
01:06:43,024 --> 01:06:45,094
- Gosh.
- He's good.

2038
01:06:45,364 --> 01:06:47,193
- He can't lift that.
- He can't lift it.

2039
01:06:47,194 --> 01:06:48,533
You only have one chance.

2040
01:06:48,534 --> 01:06:49,563
It won't be lifted.

2041
01:06:49,564 --> 01:06:52,363
- It breaks really well.
- It won't be lifted.

2042
01:06:52,364 --> 01:06:54,534
Just throw it from there.

2043
01:06:54,734 --> 01:06:56,004
Don't make me laugh.

2044
01:06:56,534 --> 01:06:58,934
If you throw it from there and it goes in, that's a success.

2045
01:06:59,004 --> 01:07:00,903
- Push it in.
- That might work.

2046
01:07:00,904 --> 01:07:02,214
What?

2047
01:07:02,474 --> 01:07:04,444
(He managed to lift it up!)

2048
01:07:04,644 --> 01:07:05,983
Amazing.

2049
01:07:05,984 --> 01:07:07,384
He's delicate.

2050
01:07:07,914 --> 01:07:09,083
(Number 1 delicate guy despite his big build)

2051
01:07:09,084 --> 01:07:10,353
What is this?

2052
01:07:10,354 --> 01:07:12,154
(Number 1 delicate guy despite his big build)

2053
01:07:12,184 --> 01:07:14,794
This will work.

2054
01:07:15,154 --> 01:07:16,554
Moon Se Yoon!

2055
01:07:16,724 --> 01:07:17,724
(He tightly grips it.)

2056
01:07:17,725 --> 01:07:19,394
He's really delicate.

2057
01:07:19,664 --> 01:07:22,734
His legs are so steady.

2058
01:07:22,964 --> 01:07:24,193
(He's almost there.)

2059
01:07:24,194 --> 01:07:26,634
This is the best. He deserves it.

2060
01:07:27,304 --> 01:07:29,204
(He succeeded in the delivery.)

2061
01:07:29,604 --> 01:07:30,703
(Feeling thrilled)

2062
01:07:30,704 --> 01:07:31,744
What's the weight?

2063
01:07:31,844 --> 01:07:33,444
- What's the weight?
- Amazing.

2064
01:07:33,604 --> 01:07:34,913
It's 21.2g.

2065
01:07:34,914 --> 01:07:36,174
Amazing.

2066
01:07:36,914 --> 01:07:39,643
(He's behind Joon's record by 0.2g.)

2067
01:07:39,644 --> 01:07:41,553
- Great!
- Yours was 21.4g, right?

2068
01:07:41,554 --> 01:07:44,214
- Never give up, everyone.
- That much is good too.

2069
01:07:44,454 --> 01:07:46,200
You won't get to eat the moment you give up.

2070
01:07:46,224 --> 01:07:48,324
I saw the person working here. Our eyes met.

2071
01:07:48,594 --> 01:07:50,853
- Can I ask her opinion?
- Okay.

2072
01:07:50,854 --> 01:07:53,093
There are plates 2, 4, 3, and 6.

2073
01:07:53,094 --> 01:07:54,193
- Which one should I choose?
- Number four.

2074
01:07:54,194 --> 01:07:56,093
- Four?
- Four.

2075
01:07:56,094 --> 01:07:58,093
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2076
01:07:58,094 --> 01:07:59,803
- Four!
- Buy the tofu yourself, Sae Ho!

2077
01:07:59,804 --> 01:08:01,903
- One, two, three! Four!
- I also...

2078
01:08:01,904 --> 01:08:04,673
(He gets the whisk.)

2079
01:08:04,674 --> 01:08:06,443
- What is it?
- You make meringue with that.

2080
01:08:06,444 --> 01:08:09,173
What is this? You never know. You can use it.

2081
01:08:09,174 --> 01:08:10,573
Do I put this in and whisk it?

2082
01:08:10,574 --> 01:08:13,214
- That's not a bad idea.
- Right.

2083
01:08:13,444 --> 01:08:15,354
- Would this work?
- I...

2084
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:18,014
(He scoops quite a large amount.)

2085
01:08:18,484 --> 01:08:19,923
(He becomes 1st with 91.4g.)

2086
01:08:19,924 --> 01:08:22,224
Yes!

2087
01:08:22,654 --> 01:08:24,093
(DinDin picked tongs.)

2088
01:08:24,094 --> 01:08:26,224
He lifted it.

2089
01:08:26,424 --> 01:08:27,563
It's falling!

2090
01:08:27,564 --> 01:08:29,793
- It works.
- Okay!

2091
01:08:29,794 --> 01:08:32,664
(DinDin moved 84g.)

2092
01:08:32,904 --> 01:08:34,303
It's 84.0g?

2093
01:08:34,304 --> 01:08:35,973
(1st: Sae Ho, 2nd: DinDin, 3rd: Joon, 4th: Se Yoon)

2094
01:08:35,974 --> 01:08:38,204
I've failed. It's not going well today.

2095
01:08:38,844 --> 01:08:40,544
We have plates 3 and 6.

2096
01:08:41,274 --> 01:08:42,944
Yes. Number three?

2097
01:08:42,974 --> 01:08:44,473
Lucky three.

2098
01:08:44,474 --> 01:08:47,113
I'll trust you, ma'am. Lucky three.

2099
01:08:47,114 --> 01:08:48,583
One, two, three.

2100
01:08:48,584 --> 01:08:50,783
(He gets an ear pick.)

2101
01:08:50,784 --> 01:08:51,853
What is it?

2102
01:08:51,854 --> 01:08:53,323
That's...

2103
01:08:53,324 --> 01:08:54,484
It's an ear pick.

2104
01:08:55,224 --> 01:08:57,354
- She knows how to make it fun.
- Ear pick.

2105
01:08:57,754 --> 01:08:59,793
(Is this possible?)

2106
01:08:59,794 --> 01:09:01,093
Why are you...

2107
01:09:01,094 --> 01:09:03,894
giving her a look filled with resentment?

2108
01:09:03,994 --> 01:09:06,463
That's why you have to choose yourself.

2109
01:09:06,464 --> 01:09:09,374
There are times you pick your ear and this much comes out.

2110
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:10,874
- Give it a try.
- Yes.

2111
01:09:11,074 --> 01:09:12,173
(Laughing)

2112
01:09:12,174 --> 01:09:15,443
- You can't balance with this.
- You can...

2113
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:17,124
It will be amazing if I succeed with this.

2114
01:09:17,744 --> 01:09:19,213
You have to take it quickly.

2115
01:09:19,214 --> 01:09:20,244
(Moving carefully)

2116
01:09:21,484 --> 01:09:23,384
No. That...

2117
01:09:23,714 --> 01:09:25,153
If that works...

2118
01:09:25,154 --> 01:09:26,724
- Stab it.
- Do you see some hope?

2119
01:09:26,984 --> 01:09:29,053
I think it could work if I do it well.

2120
01:09:29,054 --> 01:09:30,223
- Really?
- Really?

2121
01:09:30,224 --> 01:09:31,893
- That won't work.
- Go ahead.

2122
01:09:31,894 --> 01:09:34,124
You can't balance it.

2123
01:09:34,264 --> 01:09:36,093
(It splits in half.)

2124
01:09:36,094 --> 01:09:37,564
Just put it in your mouth.

2125
01:09:38,434 --> 01:09:41,633
It might be a win for you if you put it in your mouth.

2126
01:09:41,634 --> 01:09:43,773
That's unfortunate.

2127
01:09:43,774 --> 01:09:45,274
That's unfortunate.

2128
01:09:45,874 --> 01:09:47,603
- It's coming up.
- Three.

2129
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:49,173
- Two.
- There!

2130
01:09:49,174 --> 01:09:50,213
- It's coming up.
- Three.

2131
01:09:50,214 --> 01:09:51,343
(He just delivers a small amount.)

2132
01:09:51,344 --> 01:09:52,944
(Shaking it off)

2133
01:09:53,444 --> 01:09:55,984
It's not even 0.1g.

2134
01:09:56,384 --> 01:09:58,014
I've failed. Okay.

2135
01:09:58,684 --> 01:10:00,783
I think there's a funny one left.

2136
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:02,723
We didn't get a toothpick yet.

2137
01:10:02,724 --> 01:10:04,453
The last one. I'll open number six.

2138
01:10:04,454 --> 01:10:05,623
One, two, three!

2139
01:10:05,624 --> 01:10:06,693
(He gets a long teaspoon.)

2140
01:10:06,694 --> 01:10:07,694
What is it?

2141
01:10:07,695 --> 01:10:09,763
It's the one you use for making highballs.

2142
01:10:09,764 --> 01:10:12,063
It's not bad.

2143
01:10:12,064 --> 01:10:13,103
It's not bad.

2144
01:10:13,104 --> 01:10:14,603
- It's good.
- I'm doomed.

2145
01:10:14,604 --> 01:10:16,003
- Do you think you'll win?
- Yes.

2146
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:17,904
- Really?
- I'll be in third place, at least.

2147
01:10:18,004 --> 01:10:20,043
What will happen to Joon?

2148
01:10:20,044 --> 01:10:21,750
(The current 3rd place is getting nervous.)

2149
01:10:21,774 --> 01:10:23,513
- I'll go.
- I thought it was different.

2150
01:10:23,514 --> 01:10:25,683
I'll go now.

2151
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:26,944
This is really easy.

2152
01:10:27,414 --> 01:10:29,753
- It's over.
- That won't work.

2153
01:10:29,754 --> 01:10:31,353
That's like a ladle to me.

2154
01:10:31,354 --> 01:10:32,684
It breaks.

2155
01:10:33,084 --> 01:10:34,123
(He's flustered.)

2156
01:10:34,124 --> 01:10:35,753
- Go and buy it.
- Jong Min.

2157
01:10:35,754 --> 01:10:38,523
Don't be greedy. Just take more than 21.4g.

2158
01:10:38,524 --> 01:10:40,823
- You don't need to take a lot.
- You don't need to.

2159
01:10:40,824 --> 01:10:41,994
It's what I want.

2160
01:10:42,634 --> 01:10:43,963
- It worked.
- Your hand should be...

2161
01:10:43,964 --> 01:10:45,063
at the red mark.

2162
01:10:45,064 --> 01:10:46,804
It's over once it falls.

2163
01:10:47,134 --> 01:10:49,433
(He gets greedy and scoops out a big chunk.)

2164
01:10:49,434 --> 01:10:52,004
What? Michael Jackson.

2165
01:10:52,204 --> 01:10:53,443
What?

2166
01:10:53,444 --> 01:10:55,413
He's moving like a robot.

2167
01:10:55,414 --> 01:10:56,543
(He moves slowly like a robot.)

2168
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:58,713
- What's going on?
- Please.

2169
01:10:58,714 --> 01:10:59,944
- Gosh.
- Please.

2170
01:11:00,114 --> 01:11:02,053
- I'm scared.
- It's falling.

2171
01:11:02,054 --> 01:11:03,383
It's splitting.

2172
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:04,983
You have to come quickly. You don't have much time left.

2173
01:11:04,984 --> 01:11:06,183
It's splitting.

2174
01:11:06,184 --> 01:11:07,723
- It's breaking.
- It's splitting.

2175
01:11:07,724 --> 01:11:09,294
(Moving carefully)

2176
01:11:09,454 --> 01:11:10,723
- Hurry!
- It's splitting.

2177
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:11,893
It's...

2178
01:11:11,894 --> 01:11:13,603
(Is he going to run?)

2179
01:11:15,599 --> 01:11:16,599
It's splitting.

2180
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:18,349
You have to come quickly. You don't have much time left.

2181
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:19,479
It's splitting.

2182
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,979
- It's breaking.
- It's splitting.

2183
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,580
(Moving carefully)

2184
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:24,079
- Hurry!
- It's splitting.

2185
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,189
It's...

2186
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:27,190
(Is he going to run?)

2187
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,789
- Hurry.
- It's splitting.

2188
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:31,990
It's...

2189
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:34,630
(It fell.)

2190
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,099
(His greed caused the disaster.)

2191
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,369
(He was saved.)

2192
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:42,199
- He was greedy.
- Why did you take so much?

2193
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,839
- You took so much.
- He was greedy.

2194
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,409
You could have taken just a small amount.

2195
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:46,509
Why were you greedy?

2196
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:49,139
Being greedy leads to that.

2197
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,409
The Nolbu.

2198
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:52,480
I keep losing to Joon by a slim margin.

2199
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,280
- It was 0.2g.
- I lost because of that 0.2g.

2200
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,749
- The difference was 0.2g.
- Sae Ho,

2201
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,120
DinDin and Joon...

2202
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,949
will be provided with breakfast.

2203
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,620
(They will be provided with breakfast.)

2204
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,389
- Gosh.
- I really want to give it a try.

2205
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:05,259
Moray eels taste really good. Gosh.

2206
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,560
Is it really over after this?

2207
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:08,359
After eating here,

2208
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,559
everyone else may leave except for Se Yoon.

2209
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,669
(Everyone else may leave except for Se Yoon.)

2210
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:14,199
(Teasing)

2211
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,539
(Feeling uncomfortable)

2212
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,969
Why is the music so loud?

2213
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:20,010
(Turning down the volume)

2214
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,739
I have to stay here longer...

2215
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,139
because of work.

2216
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:25,449
Am I allowed to watch him?

2217
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:27,279
You can do that, but you can't be given a mic.

2218
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,280
(His cameraman is surprised as he will be staying longer.)

2219
01:12:28,281 --> 01:12:29,419
You don't have to be with me, Dong Hoon.

2220
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:30,879
I'll just watch him personally.

2221
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,689
- You have to be with him.
- Dong Hoon...

2222
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:34,150
Then I'll just go home.

2223
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:37,520
Dong Hoon's head turned this much.

2224
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:38,890
Okay.

2225
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:40,789
It's okay if you stay longer.

2226
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:42,530
- Really?
- He's such a professional.

2227
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,499
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2228
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,669
- Thank you.
- Right.

2229
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:47,069
(The side dishes get served first.)

2230
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:48,569
- Gosh.
- The side dishes look nice.

2231
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:50,100
- Gosh, that looks good.
- Right.

2232
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,769
- What is that?
- The mackerel is a side dish?

2233
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:54,009
What? That doesn't make sense.

2234
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:55,709
The mackerel is a side dish.

2235
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:58,810
My gosh. It's just like the main dish.

2236
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,009
The main dish is here.

2237
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,320
- This is the main dish?
- Gosh!

2238
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,520
(The soup looks spicy and refreshing.)

2239
01:13:03,521 --> 01:13:05,849
- Soft tofu is served too?
- Gosh, it smells amazing.

2240
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:06,949
It smells insane!

2241
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:08,560
Gosh! It smells incredible!

2242
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:11,189
- The soft tofu is served too.
- Let's have this after we're done.

2243
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:12,460
I'm feeling super hungry.

2244
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:14,829
- I'm hungry!
- Right. I'm hungry.

2245
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:16,160
I will distribute it.

2246
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,169
- Should I do it for you?
- No. Just leave it here for us.

2247
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:20,069
- We'll take care of it.
- Gosh, the moray eel just melts...

2248
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:21,140
inside the mouth.

2249
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:23,239
- It's my first time trying this.
- It's like some sort of slime.

2250
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,209
It's a fascinating taste. The texture is incredible.

2251
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:26,509
I'm really fascinated.

2252
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:28,609
It's completely different from what I expected from a fish.

2253
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:30,339
I'm serious. It just melts inside the mouth.

2254
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:32,379
I think it must've been harder to move the moray eel...

2255
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:33,709
instead of the soft tofu.

2256
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:34,719
(Soft as the soft tofu)

2257
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,579
This is really fascinating. I'm having...

2258
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,049
what I saw before.

2259
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,090
Right.

2260
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,090
Gosh, this is amazing.

2261
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:43,689
- It's such a fascinating taste.
- The soup tastes so nice.

2262
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:45,459
- Gosh.
- It's my first time trying this.

2263
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,389
Gosh, this is so refreshing.

2264
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:48,659
It makes no sense.

2265
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,299
- Right?
- It's really refreshing, right?

2266
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,629
It tastes a lot better than what I expected.

2267
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:53,029
- Right.
- This makes no sense.

2268
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:54,770
The kimchi feels so refreshing.

2269
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,499
- The moray eel feels so soft too.
- It's so good.

2270
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,469
It looks like a jellyfish.

2271
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:01,340
- Look at this.
- It's delicious.

2272
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,009
That must be really filling.

2273
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:04,809
Two out of the three that are eating right now...

2274
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:06,949
are the ones that don't usually have breakfast. Gosh.

2275
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:09,219
I usually don't have breakfast, but this is really good.

2276
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,519
This is really nice.

2277
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,249
Gosh, the moray eel soup must be so good.

2278
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,250
(I can't watch any more of this as I'm so hungry.)

2279
01:14:13,251 --> 01:14:14,290
I'm so hungry!

2280
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,359
I feel so hungry all of a sudden.

2281
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,429
You three must also eat.

2282
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:19,629
I'm hungry.

2283
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:20,830
(A desperate plea)

2284
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:22,759
- Your food will be served.
- I'm so hungry.

2285
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:23,760
- Please serve them their food.
- Gosh.

2286
01:14:23,761 --> 01:14:26,130
Isn't it soft tofu without any soy sauce?

2287
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,729
(They each get a bowl of Chodang soft tofu.)

2288
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,240
We still get soy sauce.

2289
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,439
The soy sauce looks good.

2290
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,340
But that's really good for you. It's protein.

2291
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,640
Thank you.

2292
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,980
- Right.
- Thank you.

2293
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,809
Gosh, it's so good.

2294
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:41,549
(How can this be enough for anyone?)

2295
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:43,979
The texture is amazing. It's really fascinating.

2296
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,796
(They feel jealous about their moray eel soup.)

2297
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:48,259
(Done in two bites)

2298
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:50,289
From last night's Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors,

2299
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,359
we have a Guess Who question that's left.

2300
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,229
- Gosh!
- One person will be exempted?

2301
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:55,659
- That's amazing.
- Okay. That sounds great!

2302
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,029
Will the winner be able to get a whole bowl of soup?

2303
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:59,269
- Yes.
- Really?

2304
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:01,069
Give everything you have. What a chance.

2305
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:02,499
- There's just one question.
- Okay.

2306
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,599
Please!

2307
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,810
Here it comes.

2308
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:06,870
Ta-da!

2309
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:10,480
(Who are the three that are mixed in this photo?)

2310
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:15,219
I figured out two of them.

2311
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,620
- Seon Ho!
- Seon Ho.

2312
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:18,920
Kim Yeong Cheol, Lee Byung Hun,

2313
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:20,850
and Kim Joon Ho.

2314
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,489
Incorrect! You got two right.

2315
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:24,360
- Se Yoon! Lee Byung Hun, - Right.

2316
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,930
- Lee Seo Jin, - Right.

2317
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:28,729
And Heo Sung Tae.

2318
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:30,230
Incorrect! You got two right.

2319
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,999
- Jong Min!
- Seon Ho!

2320
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,569
- Jong Min.
- I was faster.

2321
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:35,670
- Okay.
- Hold on.

2322
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,669
Lee Byung Hun, Heo Sung Tae,

2323
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:40,069
- Lee Seo Jin.
- and Kim Joon Ho.

2324
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:41,309
- Gosh, he's right.
- Joon Ho?

2325
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:43,439
- His mouth is open. It's him.
- That's the answer.

2326
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,509
Joon Ho has his mouth open.

2327
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:45,609
Comedian Kim Joon Ho.

2328
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:47,109
It's definitely him. Gosh.

2329
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:48,549
Jong Min, you are correct.

2330
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:49,849
(Jong Min is correct.)

2331
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,549
Were you the first one to mention Joon Ho?

2332
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:53,250
No. It was him.

2333
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:55,659
- How did you get that?
- It was these three.

2334
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:58,459
(Lee Byung Hun, Kim Joon Ho, Heo Sung Tae)

2335
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:00,659
(He quickly takes a sip.)

2336
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:01,859
It's so good.

2337
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:03,759
It tastes amazing, ma'am.

2338
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,999
- Just give us a little bit.
- It will be harder for you then.

2339
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,669
- The two of us will battle it out.
- Is this okay?

2340
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:09,340
You be the one to give us the question.

2341
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:11,910
Make the faces of three people with your own face.

2342
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:13,670
We'll try to guess who it is.

2343
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:16,340
I will do it for two people.

2344
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,210
No. Three people.

2345
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:21,080
Is this the first face?

2346
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:22,349
(Who is that?)

2347
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:24,250
- Who is that?
- Se Yoon!

2348
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:25,390
DinDin!

2349
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:26,950
You got one right.

2350
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,159
That was DinDin's mouth.

2351
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,459
- You mixed three people together?
- Gosh.

2352
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:32,829
- I mixed them together.
- Right.

2353
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:35,699
The eyes look sly. He's laughing with his eyes.

2354
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,730
Se Yoon!

2355
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:39,730
It's DinDin with Lee Hyo Ri's eyes!

2356
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,640
There's also Joon.

2357
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:43,500
- You got two right.
- Really?

2358
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:47,170
- See?
- Those were Lee Hyo Ri's eyes.

2359
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:48,479
(Laughing)

2360
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,709
Those were Lee Hyo Ri's eyes.

2361
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:51,979
The face looks ugly in general.

2362
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,949
The base of this ugliness is from this person.

2363
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:57,280
Se Yoon! It's DinDin, Lee Hyo Ri, and Cho Sae Ho!

2364
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:58,919
Correct!

2365
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,049
(What?)

2366
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:01,120
Where was I in his face?

2367
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,359
(Super thrilled)

2368
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,159
- Where was I in his face?
- How did you get that right?

2369
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,889
- Let me see.
- So Sae Ho was the base.

2370
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:09,159
- He was the base.
- Sae Ho was the base.

2371
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,320
He keeps changing his face whenever I mention someone.

2372
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,580
He changes his face to the person that is mentioned.

2373
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:14,970
(Laughing)

2374
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:20,110
This is so painful to watch. I want to have some right now.

2375
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,339
Gosh, it's so refreshing.

2376
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:24,849
This was so good.

2377
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,109
I loved it.

2378
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:27,849
Do we head home now?

2379
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:28,979
Yes. Let's go.

2380
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:32,149
(Satisfied with the early departure)

2381
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:33,520
- Come with me, Sae Ho.
- So...

2382
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:35,959
So the Defeat Fairy of 2 Days 1 Night...

2383
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,659
- is Moon Se Yoon!
- Moon Se Yoon!

2384
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:43,060
(The Defeat Fairy will head out to get his punishment.)

2385
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,659
(Se Yoon heads out to get his punishment.)

2386
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,099
- Let's go.
- Are we all set?

2387
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,170
Yes.

2388
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:48,739
I feel relieved to have you next to me.

2389
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:50,270
I'm going with a top entertainer.

2390
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,409
We will finally begin.

2391
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:54,779
It's time for his punishment.

2392
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,109
I'm sorry, but why are you here?

2393
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:59,609
Unfortunately, he became the Defeat Fairy of 2 Days 1 Night.

2394
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:02,419
He's heading out on his own to get his punishment.

2395
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:03,749
I'm here with Moon Se Yoon.

2396
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:06,089
- Hello.
- It's great to see you.

2397
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:07,249
What segment is this?

2398
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,589
It's called "Meeting You."

2399
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:09,789
- "Meeting You."
- Right.

2400
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,059
Please greet the viewers that are watching.

2401
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,059
Hello, everyone. You all thought it was over, right?

2402
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,189
- Right.
- The show will carry on.

2403
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,229
- I became the Defeat Fairy, - Right.

2404
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:17,659
And I'm heading out for my punishment.

2405
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,429
- Right. After many different games.
- Yes.

2406
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:21,839
What do you think was the cause of your loss?

2407
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,939
I believe it was all because of Joon.

2408
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:25,409
- It was because of Joon?
- Yes.

2409
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,469
- I got ahead of myself.
- Right.

2410
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:30,109
- Yes.
- I raised my hand to be with him.

2411
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:32,250
I believe my right hand was to blame.

2412
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:35,579
(Even though he was known to lose all the time, )

2413
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,720
(Se Yoon decided to volunteer to join Joon's team.)

2414
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,890
(He got ahead of himself...)

2415
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:43,060
(and ended up being in his team.)

2416
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:45,289
(Reason for Se Yoon becoming the Defeat Fairy)

2417
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:47,370
(Lee Joon 98 percent, Se Yoon's silliness 2 percent)

2418
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:49,059
I think we are almost there.

2419
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:51,259
- Right.
- Take a deep breath, Se Yoon.

2420
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:53,500
It feels relieving to have you next to me though.

2421
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,470
The color of the sea reminds me of the Maldives.

2422
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:59,370
- Right.
- Gosh, it's hot.

2423
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:01,540
Bring anyone to me.

2424
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:02,980
I will win no matter what.

2425
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:07,249
(On that day, )

2426
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:10,780
(a nationwide heat wave warning happened to be issued.)

2427
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:14,049
(The maximum temperature in Gangneung was 37°C.)

2428
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:16,119
You should go, Sae Ho. Will you be okay?

2429
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,760
- I like this kind of weather.
- Really?

2430
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:19,260
I like going to saunas.

2431
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:20,889
I like this feeling.

2432
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,759
Gosh, it's hard to breathe now that we're on the sand.

2433
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,799
(The staff members)

2434
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,200
Why are they all the way there?

2435
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:26,870
(Sighing)

2436
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:28,030
(Struggling)

2437
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:29,870
The sea is truly blue, isn't it?

2438
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,299
It's truly blue.

2439
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,510
This is Sageunjin Beach.

2440
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:35,979
It's nice out here.

2441
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:38,156
I think the color of the sea looks prettier than yesterday.

2442
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,386
Gosh, look at the color of the sea. It's like a sports drink.

2443
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:41,819
It makes me want to drink some.

2444
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,319
Gosh, it's really pretty.

2445
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,419
(The emerald sea and pastel-colored breakwaters)

2446
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:48,989
A lot of visitors come to this place to take pictures...

2447
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:51,559
with the pastel-tone breakwaters.

2448
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:52,790
(A popular place for pictures)

2449
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:54,729
So when do all of these visitors actually come?

2450
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:56,930
- This place...
- How long must I wait?

2451
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:00,270
You always find the places that are empty.

2452
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,339
Please bring out the briefcase and the container.

2453
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,939
Do I become Gong Yoo?

2454
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,969
- Yes. Carry these with you.
- Right.

2455
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:08,540
- "Would you like to play a game?"
- Right.

2456
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:09,779
- Yes.
- The game is drawn from here.

2457
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:12,649
The game will be an important factor.

2458
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:15,620
You can play against the people who have visited the beach.

2459
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,019
You will be able to go home the moment you win.

2460
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:19,190
- Okay.
- Right.

2461
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:20,650
If you lose,

2462
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:25,229
you will be able to play another game after 30 minutes.

2463
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:26,790
Where would I stay for 30 minutes?

2464
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,029
- Somewhere here.
- Where would I stay?

2465
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:31,900
You can lie down under the parasol.

2466
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:34,530
But if you lose,

2467
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,800
you can go against the same opponent.

2468
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,340
After 30 minutes? Would that person wait for 30 minutes?

2469
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:41,190
Wouldn't that person be considered insane?

2470
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,539
You could meet the same person after they swim for 30 minutes.

2471
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,809
- Well...
- Go ahead.

2472
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:47,710
There's someone over there. Go.

2473
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:50,550
Okay. I see a kid.

2474
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:51,920
Come here!

2475
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:53,689
Gosh, this is nice.

2476
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:55,360
I should call him over.

2477
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:59,089
- I'm on TV!
- Yes! Give me a hug!

2478
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:01,290
(Hugging)

2479
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:03,359
- Hi!
- Are you here with your parents?

2480
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,480
- Yes.
- That's your mother?

2481
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,400
This is great. Could you introduce yourself to us?

2482
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:10,539
Hello. I'm a sixth grader in Onyang Dongsin Elementary School.

2483
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:12,070
My name is Jeong Ju Won.

2484
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,869
- 2 Days...
- 1 Night!

2485
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:15,980
Great.

2486
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,279
- He's so cute.
- All right.

2487
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,280
There's nothing special.

2488
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,380
You will be playing a game against me.

2489
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,479
- You just need to do your best.
- Right.

2490
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,089
Got it? The game has to be picked.

2491
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:27,190
Would you like to pick it? Or should I pick it?

2492
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,520
I'll pick the game.

2493
01:21:28,521 --> 01:21:30,490
Okay. He's so proactive.

2494
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:33,260
Okay. Pick a game.

2495
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:34,830
Please.

2496
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:36,359
Please show it to us.

2497
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,400
- All right. Say it out loud for us.
- One, two, three.

2498
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:42,469
"Win three consecutive rounds of Cham, Cham, Cham."

2499
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:44,540
Gosh, that isn't easy.

2500
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:46,669
That isn't easy.

2501
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:47,740
(Worried)

2502
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:49,480
Which side do you usually like?

2503
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:50,680
Well...

2504
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,749
(The 43-year-old tries to play mind games with the 13-year-old.)

2505
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,449
You want your face to be on camera, right?

2506
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:56,679
- Yes.
- Which way must you look then?

2507
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:57,719
The left!

2508
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,419
That's right. You should look at this side.

2509
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:01,701
If I were you, I'd do this to show my face to the camera.

2510
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,619
- What do you think?
- Good.

2511
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:05,430
Don't you think it's a good idea?

2512
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:08,329
Please try your best to win.

2513
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:09,400
- Okay.
- All right.

2514
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:12,599
(Ju Won, I want to go home.)

2515
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,169
(Avoiding his eyes)

2516
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:17,370
My gosh. I can't read your eyes.

2517
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:20,470
His eyes look very playful.

2518
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:21,810
Let's do it then.

2519
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:24,009
You should look at this side to show your face.

2520
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:25,109
Look at the camera over there.

2521
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:28,179
Your friends will be like, "Hey, you're on 2 Days 1 Night!"

2522
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,979
Shall we begin? Cham, cham, cham!

2523
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:31,079
- Okay.
- Okay.

2524
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,890
Your friends will be like, "Will he be doing it two more times?"

2525
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:35,590
That was a short time.

2526
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,289
That was for a short moment, so you should do it two more times.

2527
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:40,730
All right. Cham, cham, cham.

2528
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:42,099
(Se Yoon's 2nd attempt is successful.)

2529
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,130
My goodness.

2530
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,430
(He will probably go home soon.)

2531
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:48,229
(My goodness. I met a real treasure.)

2532
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:49,269
Let's continue.

2533
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:50,569
You will look at the camera for the last time.

2534
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:51,869
"Guys, I'm on 2 Days 1 Night!"

2535
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:53,190
- That will be cool. Okay?
- Yes.

2536
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:54,470
Let's do this.

2537
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:55,680
Let's go. Okay.

2538
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:57,579
Let's do this and look cool. It's the last attempt.

2539
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:58,580
Cham, cham, cham.

2540
01:22:58,581 --> 01:22:59,926
(Se Yoon goes to the left again this time.)

2541
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:01,750
(What is Ju Won's choice?)

2542
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:02,919
Cham, cham, cham!

2543
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,680
(Ju Won wins.)

2544
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:07,550
(Mission failed)

2545
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,760
(This is so exciting.)

2546
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,690
You are amazing.

2547
01:23:13,790 --> 01:23:16,030
(Only Se Yoon feels bitter.)

2548
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,859
(Staring at him)

2549
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,229
He knows what's funny.

2550
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:21,069
(Jeong Ju Won, 13 years old, a kid who knows what's funny)

2551
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:23,439
Please interview him. I'm still in shock.

2552
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,169
All right. Thank you for joining us today. What was your name?

2553
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:27,339
Jeong Ju Won.

2554
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:30,239
Ju Won, you kept turning your head to the left.

2555
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,309
At the last minute, I thought you'd do the same,

2556
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:34,080
but why did you turn your head to the right?

2557
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:35,649
I did it for a twist.

2558
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:37,379
For a twist.

2559
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,049
Now that you're on 2 Days 1 Night,

2560
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:42,390
why don't you say something to your friends?

2561
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,389
I'm on TV!

2562
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:45,459
(Bright)

2563
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,159
Thanks to you,

2564
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,399
Se Yoon will have to wait here...

2565
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,529
for 30 minutes until he plays the next game.

2566
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:54,930
Do you have anything to say to Se Yoon?

2567
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:56,470
- Ju Won.
- Well...

2568
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:59,669
I'm sorry, but please wait for another 30 minutes.

2569
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:02,209
All right. Don't worry about me.

2570
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:03,610
Can I give him a hug?

2571
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:06,510
Please pose for this camera here.

2572
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,110
One, two, three.

2573
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,420
(Everyone is happy but Se Yoon.)

2574
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:14,950
It's 10:55am now.

2575
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:18,159
You will try again in 30 minutes.

2576
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,190
(He will try again in 30 minutes.)

2577
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:21,999
I should get going.

2578
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,199
Where are you going?

2579
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,299
- Stay with me.
- Stay?

2580
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,769
- Where should we wait?
- Stay here.

2581
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:26,830
Us?

2582
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,129
Why don't you take a photo together for your friendship?

2583
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:29,700
Okay. Let's take a photo.

2584
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:31,746
- We have time, so...
- We can take it here.

2585
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:33,910
Let's go there and take a photo.

2586
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,879
Let's take it here.

2587
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,480
The color of the East Sea is beautiful.

2588
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:40,450
- Wait, he is...
- Isn't he Ju Won?

2589
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,250
- Ju Won.
- Ju Won.

2590
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:43,819
- Didn't you leave?
- You're still here.

2591
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,020
(They meet Ju Won again.)

2592
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:47,290
We're here to take some photos.

2593
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:49,820
- That spot looks nice.
- Can you take a photo of us?

2594
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,390
Ju Won.

2595
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:54,459
One, two, three.

2596
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,300
(Ju Won takes a friendship photo of them.)

2597
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,100
One, two, three.

2598
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:01,730
(With a friend, Sageunjin Beach, A friendship photo)

2599
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:03,540
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

2600
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:05,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Ju Won.

2601
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:07,970
Let's play fun games together again later.

2602
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:09,940
- Bye. Thank you.
- Bye.

2603
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,739
Here. We can sit here.

2604
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:13,056
(After taking a cool friendship photo, )

2605
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,420
(they take a break in the shade for a moment.)

2606
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:16,779
This is nice.

2607
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:18,050
I like this portable fan.

2608
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,990
(Se Yoon suddenly has a portable fan?)

2609
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:23,159
All right. The one with the sunglasses on.

2610
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,289
- We will meet in 15 minutes.
- Okay.

2611
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:26,930
Then...

2612
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:29,359
By the way,

2613
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,599
you might leave, so can I keep one of your belongings?

2614
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:32,900
Your portable fan.

2615
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,699
- We will keep your portable fan.
- So you can't leave.

2616
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:36,970
- Yes.
- Thank you.

2617
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:38,439
- We will meet here.
- Here.

2618
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,010
Let's do this then.

2619
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:42,009
While Se Yoon is using this fan,

2620
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:43,239
you will approach him,

2621
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:46,750
and say, "I'm sorry, but can I borrow your fan? It's hot."

2622
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:49,219
- And it begins.
- Then the game will begin.

2623
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:50,680
- Thank you.
- All right.

2624
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,519
It's been 30 minutes.

2625
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,990
- Okay. Come on. Can I start?
- Really?

2626
01:25:56,190 --> 01:25:57,859
- Yes.
- All right.

2627
01:25:57,860 --> 01:25:59,500
It's time. Who should I play a game with?

2628
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:01,259
It's really hot.

2629
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:02,400
(Glancing)

2630
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:04,630
Who should I play a game with?

2631
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:09,070
(They are getting ready to start a skit!)

2632
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:12,240
What? Did you ask them to act?

2633
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:14,570
Would you like to play a game?

2634
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:16,539
- We'd love to.
- Okay.

2635
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:17,540
- Really?
- Hang on.

2636
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:20,549
Can I borrow the fan?

2637
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,749
Is this what I'm supposed to say?

2638
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,249
- Yes. Sure.
- We...

2639
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,150
- Let's move to this side.
- Here.

2640
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:26,820
Nice to meet you.

2641
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:28,989
This is your portable fan, right?

2642
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:30,119
Please stand here.

2643
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,619
She's the guest with a reservation.

2644
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,260
I will play a game with Seo Yul.

2645
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:34,789
If I win, I will go home.

2646
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:37,270
And if I lose, I will have to play a game with another person.

2647
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:40,429
- Okay?
- He just lost to a kid.

2648
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:41,599
- Really?
- So this is important.

2649
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:42,769
- Please pick a game.
- A game?

2650
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:43,770
Yes.

2651
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,570
Please open it.

2652
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,840
Please.

2653
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:48,410
It's the Sandcastle Game.

2654
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,039
This is a good one.

2655
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,040
The Sandcastle Game.

2656
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:52,726
Is it going to be okay? The sand is hot now.

2657
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:55,279
- Even if it's hot...
- Please gather the sand.

2658
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,650
- Should I do that?
- Yes.

2659
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,650
I don't want to be tanned.

2660
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:00,719
All right. This is the Sandcastle Game.

2661
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,859
The one who makes the flag fall down first...

2662
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:05,659
loses the game. All right.

2663
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:07,189
Let's play rock-paper-scissors to decide who will go first.

2664
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:08,260
Rock-paper-scissors.

2665
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:10,260
(Win)

2666
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,800
(Se Yoon goes first.)

2667
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,570
(A big handful)

2668
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:17,700
Gosh, it's too hot.

2669
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:20,739
(He overcomes the heat and succeeds.)

2670
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:21,770
Just fall over!

2671
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,040
(Interested)

2672
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:27,209
(Now it's Seo Yul's turn.)

2673
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:29,350
Be bold.

2674
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:32,120
When you lose, you win. Good.

2675
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,150
My gosh.

2676
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:35,820
(Shaking)

2677
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:37,890
(The flag is shaking.)

2678
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,590
My gosh. What?

2679
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:42,929
Okay. Three, two, one.

2680
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:43,930
Okay.

2681
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:46,030
(She barely made it.)

2682
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:48,530
(Now it's Se Yoon's turn.)

2683
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:51,840
(Just a little)

2684
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:56,980
(Se Yoon loses.)

2685
01:27:57,210 --> 01:27:58,479
Seo Yul wins!

2686
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,950
(I win!)

2687
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,420
It's the wind.

2688
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:04,520
All right then.

2689
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,249
You will try again in 30 minutes.

2690
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:09,059
- I want to go home.
- Thank you.

2691
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:11,419
All right. One, two, three.

2692
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,266
(We thank Seo Yul for playing the game with us.)

2693
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:15,260
- You should do well.
- This is the worst.

2694
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:17,899
- Try harder.
- The sand...

2695
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,900
Did you do that on purpose?

2696
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:22,500
Not on purpose. It was random.

2697
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,040
The wind blew at the moment.

2698
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:31,540
(30 minutes later)

2699
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,980
(The 2 celebrities are sitting alone.)

2700
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:39,249
Should I talk to the man over there?

2701
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:40,389
Hello.

2702
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:42,019
Your kid is lovely.

2703
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:43,059
(They found a family playing at the beach.)

2704
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,060
- Really?
- Then...

2705
01:28:44,061 --> 01:28:46,466
Would you play a game with us? We will take a photo with you.

2706
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:48,560
Please stand here, sir.

2707
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,829
Nice to meet you.

2708
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:52,599
- We...
- Dad went to play a game with him.

2709
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,499
Thank you for joining us today.

2710
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,539
We should play a game.

2711
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,169
Please introduce yourself first.

2712
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:00,009
My name is Kim Jong Su.

2713
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:01,609
- Jong?
- Kim Jong Su.

2714
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:03,209
Jong Su. Nice to meet you.

2715
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:04,580
Are they your children?

2716
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,279
Only the girl is my son.

2717
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,850
- And the boy is her friend.
- What?

2718
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:09,819
- "Only the girl is my son?"
- No.

2719
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:11,649
- What are you talking about?
- Only the girl is my child.

2720
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:13,520
I see. Is this your first time on TV?

2721
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:15,150
I'm feeling nervous.

2722
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,419
- You're too nervous to play a game.
- Yes.

2723
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:19,489
Okay. That's good. Please come this way.

2724
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:21,859
Sae Ho, he's nervous. We should hurry.

2725
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:22,960
Please pick one.

2726
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:25,329
Open it.

2727
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:27,830
Show it to the camera and read it.

2728
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,800
Action Mukjjibba.

2729
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,169
You picked Action Mukjjibba.

2730
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:33,870
You will play Action Mukjjibba with me.

2731
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:38,110
You should win, and I'll try to win. Action Mukjjibba.

2732
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,149
Will Se Yoon be able to go home?

2733
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:42,850
- If he wins, will he go home?
- Yes.

2734
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:44,179
I hope you'll go home soon.

2735
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:45,920
- Really?
- How nice.

2736
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:47,619
- Please help me.
- Okay.

2737
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:49,790
- A game to go home.
- It's already been an hour.

2738
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,490
Rock-paper-scissors.

2739
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:53,029
Rock-paper-scissors.

2740
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:55,060
All right. It's your turn to attack.

2741
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:58,360
(If he loses here, he will have to stay.)

2742
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:01,929
- Scissors.
- What are you doing?

2743
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:03,469
(He lost again.)

2744
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:04,470
I'm sorry.

2745
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:06,409
You're so bad at this.

2746
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:09,379
(He has to stay.)

2747
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:13,580
(30 minutes later)

2748
01:30:14,150 --> 01:30:15,680
Would you like to play a game with me?

2749
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:17,480
Sae Ho, my game draw.

2750
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:20,120
Sae Ho.

2751
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:22,989
Nice to meet you.

2752
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:24,489
Please introduce yourself.

2753
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:28,260
My name is Na Moon Hee, and I live in Incheon.

2754
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:29,899
- Na Moon Hee?
- I see.

2755
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:31,859
Ms. Na is here.

2756
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:32,930
Please.

2757
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,030
Please open it and show us.

2758
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:36,440
One, two, three.

2759
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:38,440
- Game of Ddakji.
- Ddakji?

2760
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:40,709
Okay. Did you play with Ddakji when you were little?

2761
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:42,509
- No. I've never done it before.
- Okay.

2762
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:43,839
We will play it here.

2763
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,980
All right. Game of Ddakji.

2764
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,550
Rock-paper-scissors.

2765
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:49,579
- Will you go first?
- Yes.

2766
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:50,620
Okay.

2767
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:52,590
- You seem to be in a hurry.
- Yes.

2768
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:54,790
Well... Is it...

2769
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:57,990
Are you around my age, by any chance?

2770
01:30:58,290 --> 01:31:00,229
- I was born in 1982.
- We're the same age.

2771
01:31:00,230 --> 01:31:02,459
- We're friends.
- The Year of the Dog.

2772
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:04,129
We were born in the Year of the Dog.

2773
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:05,669
Good. A match between two friends.

2774
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:07,129
- My friend.
- Game of Ddakji.

2775
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:08,969
Please let me go home.

2776
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:10,839
(Who will be the winner of the Game of Ddakji?)

2777
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,540
Just once.

2778
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,040
(He checks the ground before the game.)

2779
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:16,880
Here we go.

2780
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:20,209
(If he fails, he has to wait another 30 minutes.)

2781
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:21,880
The wind.

2782
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,350
(It's flipped!)

2783
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:30,959
(Disappointed)

2784
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,329
Thank you.

2785
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:33,459
This is disappointing,

2786
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:34,759
- but Se Yoon gets to go home.
- Okay.

2787
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,299
- Thank you.
- Say thank you.

2788
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:37,399
Thank you so much, Moon Hee.

2789
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,629
Actually, I really like Ms. Na Moon Hee.

2790
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:41,100
You have the same name.

2791
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:43,469
I knew I would make it. Thank you, Moon Hee.

2792
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:44,969
One, two, three.

2793
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:46,646
(We thank Moon Hee for playing the game with us.)

2794
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:47,839
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2795
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,639
Thank you so much, Moon Hee.

2796
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,110
- Thank you.
- Have a fun trip.

2797
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,349
Defeat Fairy Moon Se Yoon.

2798
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:55,010
You've become the Victory Fairy.

2799
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:57,350
You know, life is a game of chance.

2800
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,549
If you hit rock bottom, you can only go up from there.

2801
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:01,849
- Yes.
- I hit rock bottom today.

2802
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,759
Next time, I will fly high.

2803
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:04,760
Great!

2804
01:32:04,761 --> 01:32:07,489
2 Days 1 Night will return next week...

2805
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:09,799
with more dynamic fun to entertain you.

2806
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,469
With the news that Se Yoon won,

2807
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:15,569
we can finally go home.

2808
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:18,839
- See you next week, everyone.
- Bye!

2809
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,909
- 2 Days...
- 1 Night.

2810
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,709
(2 Days 1 Night)

2811
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:24,430
- You're there, and I'm here.
- Oh, really?

2812
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:31,149
(At 1pm, they go home at last.)

2813
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:33,120
(Next episode)

2814
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:37,620
(August 18, 2024, Sae Ho and Joon joined)

2815
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,490
(They joined the group in the heat of summer.)

2816
01:32:42,230 --> 01:32:43,399
(Fall, )

2817
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,629
(winter, )

2818
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:46,000
(and spring came and went.)

2819
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:48,600
(Summer is back)

2820
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:51,440
(Sae Ho and Joon's 1st anniversary special)

2821
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:55,980
(Join in on their bucket list!)

2822
01:32:57,010 --> 01:32:59,079
(Thrilling...)

2823
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,010
(and chilling)

2824
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:03,950
(Sae Ho and Joon's bucket list)

2825
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:06,990
(Why is this on the bucket list?)

2826
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,590
(The other members don't get it, )

2827
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:13,260
(but Sae Ho and Joon are having the time of their lives.)

2828
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:15,960
(Please show your support.)

2829
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:19,430
(See you on Sunday night at 6:10pm.)
