1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:04,186
(The One Night Ribbon Trip in Seoul continues.)

2
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:09,166
(The 2079 Fashion Show ended successfully.)

3
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:11,066
(Were you startled?)

4
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:13,065
(I was very startled myself.)

5
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,166
(Screaming)

6
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,906
(It was slightly embarrassing.)

7
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:18,066
(Let's go!)

8
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:21,136
(And it was pretty romantic.)

9
00:00:21,536 --> 00:00:24,976
(An eventful and cheerful Seoul trip)

10
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,586
(At N Seoul Tower on Mount Nam)

11
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:31,946
(Indoor Sleeping Hunters)

12
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:35,956
(The 1 Night Boys fight to sleep indoors.)

13
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:38,856
(A breathtaking game of tag)

14
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,266
(Before the alarm goes off, )

15
00:00:42,596 --> 00:00:45,096
(they must sit on a bench!)

16
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:49,066
(The result of the chilling game)

17
00:00:52,476 --> 00:00:55,076
(Seon Ho sleeps outdoors)

18
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:58,476
(The survivors dance to celebrate.)

19
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:04,986
(Who will be the two others to sleep outdoors?)

20
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:09,725
(2 Days 1 Night)

21
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:12,326
Okay. Seon Ho, you can sit next to me now.

22
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:14,225
This should be fun to watch.

23
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:15,695
(Seon Ho sits next to Director Joo.)

24
00:01:15,696 --> 00:01:17,426
- Can I blow the whistle?
- Then...

25
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:18,896
This should be fun.

26
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:20,836
Isn't there one too many?

27
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:23,605
There's an extra bench now that one's out.

28
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:24,606
There's one extra.

29
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:26,206
I guess we keep playing.

30
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:28,235
- We can sit anywhere now.
- Yes.

31
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:29,805
Here goes. I'll throw the dice.

32
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:30,806
Yes.

33
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:36,046
(Who is the first chaser for Round 2?)

34
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:38,546
- Se Yoon.
- Se Yoon.

35
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:39,555
Moon Se Yoon.

36
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:40,655
(Se Yoon's it.)

37
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:43,855
I guess you're trying to slaughter a pig.

38
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:45,185
(He still hasn't recovered his energy yet.)

39
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:46,356
We'll start now.

40
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:49,626
(Sae Ho, you should go to that bench.)

41
00:01:49,996 --> 00:01:52,126
(He strategizes with Sae Ho before they begin.)

42
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:53,795
This one is going to be tough. It's driving me crazy.

43
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:54,796
(Nervous)

44
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:56,735
- Jong Min.
- Guys.

45
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,935
- We'll begin now.
- I'll go there. You come here.

46
00:01:57,936 --> 00:01:58,936
Okay.

47
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:01,236
But you must go in front of me. You're fast.

48
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:03,745
(He's planning to use DinDin as his shield.)

49
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:05,845
When the first whistle goes off, the timer will begin.

50
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:07,176
Listen for the first whistle.

51
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:08,876
All right. Get ready.

52
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:12,216
(Beeping)

53
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:14,456
(The game begins.)

54
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,706
(Just like their plan, Jong Min and DinDin switch places.)

55
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:21,096
(Sae Ho and Joon move according to their plan too.)

56
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:22,996
(Feeling relaxed for now)

57
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:25,665
I'll catch you this time.

58
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,666
Go there. Go over there instead.

59
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,465
(Joon, let's go that way.)

60
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:32,066
(Sneaky)

61
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:35,805
- I won't be able to catch them.
- You can't.

62
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:36,875
I can't catch them.

63
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:38,196
(This is different from Round 1.)

64
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:42,645
- Come back to the square.
- Go back to the square.

65
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:43,715
(The time keeps ticking.)

66
00:02:43,716 --> 00:02:44,746
- All right.
- Hey.

67
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:46,286
- Here it goes.
- My gosh.

68
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:47,956
(Hesitant)

69
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:50,656
- Come on!
- Am I doing it right?

70
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:51,925
All right.

71
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:53,656
(30 seconds have already passed.)

72
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:55,766
What? You can't do anything.

73
00:02:56,196 --> 00:02:58,165
- We can survive this round.
- We'll survive to the end.

74
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,565
(If he keeps this up, he can't catch us.)

75
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:00,765
We'll survive to the end.

76
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:01,766
We can survive this round.

77
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:04,266
(Get a grip.)

78
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:05,776
(Beeping)

79
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:09,976
(Target: Cho Sae Ho)

80
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:12,516
Gosh, I'm sitting down.

81
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:14,616
- I'm already sitting down.
- No, you're not.

82
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:17,445
(He touched Sae Ho before he could sit down.)

83
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:18,545
I'm already sitting down.

84
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:20,886
(Se Yoon isn't the chaser anymore at last.)

85
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:24,046
- Let's begin right away.
- Why are you looking at me only?

86
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:25,456
You weren't sitting down.

87
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:27,936
(He goes toward Se Yoon as soon as he gets the fan.)

88
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:31,066
(Buddy, I have eyes only for you.)

89
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:33,236
(Eyes fixed on Se Yoon)

90
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:36,635
What? What do you mean?

91
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:38,076
(He ends up being the chaser again.)

92
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:40,575
(Let's keep switching places.)

93
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:41,606
I'll begin right away.

94
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:44,406
- He got you.
- I got you.

95
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:47,776
(He touched DinDin who was moving forward.)

96
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:50,186
(He survives by using him as his shield.)

97
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:52,556
Let's begin.

98
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,856
- I got him.
- You got him.

99
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:58,156
Let's start again.

100
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:00,556
- You come here.
- Here I go.

101
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:02,466
(Running behind the bench)

102
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,166
(He's back to being the chaser again.)

103
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:08,995
(At this rate, Jong Min will never be caught.)

104
00:04:08,996 --> 00:04:11,066
You come here. Come over this way.

105
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,275
Let's begin.

106
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:14,335
(Beeping)

107
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:15,436
He got you!

108
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:17,306
Give it to me now.

109
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:20,146
- Come on.
- What?

110
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:23,292
(At this rate, he could be the Grim Reaper for Se Yoon.)

111
00:04:23,316 --> 00:04:25,086
(About to cry)

112
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:26,815
(Se Yoon, you're the only one I see.)

113
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:28,616
(He charges forward.)

114
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,485
(What...)

115
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:32,925
(just happened?)

116
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:34,126
Are you all right?

117
00:04:35,556 --> 00:04:37,666
(Striking DinDin's dental veneers)

118
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,435
(An accident breaks out.)

119
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:41,736
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

120
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:44,106
Guys, be safe. No injuries, please.

121
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,936
(He overcomes the injury and becomes the chaser.)

122
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,346
(Only 30 seconds remain.)

123
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:52,845
Let's do it right away. Just switch. You get it, right?

124
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:53,846
Okay.

125
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:55,015
(Se Yoon tries to join their plan.)

126
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:56,045
- We can all survive.
- We can just switch.

127
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,146
We can all survive.

128
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:58,846
No, I'm sorry.

129
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,685
(Sliding down)

130
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:01,686
Hey. DinDin.

131
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:03,625
Don't target me. Catch him instead.

132
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,656
Guys, don't get hurt!

133
00:05:07,756 --> 00:05:10,926
(Which one should I catch?)

134
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:13,436
Right here.

135
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:16,406
- He got Sae Ho.
- He got you.

136
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,936
You can totally turn the tables around.

137
00:05:19,506 --> 00:05:20,506
All right.

138
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:23,006
- I sat down first!
- Right here!

139
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:26,316
(Encountering a problem while switching places)

140
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:28,315
- I sat down first!
- Right here!

141
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:29,415
I sat down first!

142
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,746
(Luckily, he survives.)

143
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:33,715
- I got you.
- What?

144
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:35,255
- I got him!
- Sae Ho got him.

145
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:36,826
- I got him.
- I saw it too.

146
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,426
(He definitely touched Jong Min.)

147
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:42,626
- All right.
- Hurry.

148
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:44,507
(He becomes the chaser for the first time now.)

149
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:46,535
- He couldn't touch me.
- What?

150
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:47,536
He couldn't do it.

151
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:48,565
All right.

152
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:49,766
(Time remaining for Jong Min)

153
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:53,036
(There are two people on the same bench.)

154
00:05:53,406 --> 00:05:55,506
(This could be Jong Min's last chance.)

155
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:57,105
What? Who's it?

156
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,352
(Joon tries to run away quickly.)

157
00:05:58,376 --> 00:05:59,946
(Will Jong Min be able to catch him?)

158
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:04,546
- Okay.
- Okay.

159
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:08,055
(Taking out his anger on Sae Ho)

160
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:09,725
Okay!

161
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:10,726
(Let's have fun!)

162
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:13,496
(Dancing at the Octagonal Pavilion under the moonlight)

163
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:17,766
(The atmosphere is getting heated.)

164
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:21,595
(Everyone but Jong Min is happy.)

165
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:22,736
- Let's stop.
- All right.

166
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:25,105
Jong Min will sleep outdoors.

167
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:26,505
- My gosh.
- This is so exhausting.

168
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,736
Let's not play another round.

169
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:29,205
- You'll kill me.
- Another round?

170
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:31,106
Hey. We could die if there are only three.

171
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:33,845
- Let's play something else. Please.
- Yes. This is so exhausting.

172
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:35,206
- This is so exhausting.
- Please.

173
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:37,046
This is too exhausting.

174
00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:38,686
Gosh, I'm so out of breath.

175
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,955
Everyone, the game will change now.

176
00:06:40,956 --> 00:06:43,256
- Okay. What is it?
- The next round will be...

177
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:44,855
Pick Boys.

178
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:45,995
- Pick Boys.
- Pick?

179
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:47,402
- What are we picking?
- Starting now,

180
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:50,265
- you must go and invite...
- What?

181
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:52,465
- three people to the show.
- What next?

182
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:53,695
- Three? Okay.
- Three.

183
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,465
Are there people around here at this hour?

184
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:56,536
(Current time, 11pm)

185
00:06:57,036 --> 00:06:58,036
Okay.

186
00:06:58,037 --> 00:07:00,276
(They get going first.)

187
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,776
Hello.

188
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:05,746
We're filming a show now.

189
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:07,545
Could you help me with this game?

190
00:07:07,546 --> 00:07:09,486
- Okay.
- Okay. I got two people.

191
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,356
- I got two Chinese ladies.
- Hello.

192
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,286
- Hello. These 2 will play?
- You got 2 people?

193
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:16,955
Hello. Can you be on TV?

194
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:19,255
If you can't, feel free to tell me so.

195
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:20,556
Should we be on TV?

196
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:23,026
There's no pressure.

197
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:24,925
- Who wants to come with me?
- Me.

198
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:26,796
Okay. This way.

199
00:07:27,436 --> 00:07:28,436
Thank you.

200
00:07:28,437 --> 00:07:29,465
(Joon invites a lady too.)

201
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,036
- Thank you.
- The umbrella...

202
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:33,735
(They take a break to regroup.)

203
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:35,576
Do you know Chao Shu Hao?

204
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:37,405
- Pardon?
- Chao Shu Hao?

205
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,445
(Sae Ho's Chinese name is Chao Shu Hao.)

206
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:40,846
Ask them if they know Chao Shu Hao.

207
00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:42,615
- Do you know Chao Shu Hao?
- Yes.

208
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:44,216
They know him.

209
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,215
All three of you are famous.

210
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,656
- Okay. The three of us.
- Yes.

211
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:49,555
All three of you are famous.

212
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,755
- Really? In China?
- I see.

213
00:07:50,756 --> 00:07:52,285
- Really? In China?
- Yes.

214
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:54,195
- We're famous?
- One, two, three.

215
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:56,066
- They know the 3 of us.
- Only the 3 of us?

216
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:58,326
- Thank you.
- Okay.

217
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:00,996
By the way, Seon Ho speaks Chinese quite well.

218
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:02,705
- Really?
- He can communicate with them.

219
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:04,466
- He interpreted for us.
- Just a bit.

220
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:07,736
How about a last-minute interview?

221
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:10,506
What brings you here?

222
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:13,375
I think she's on a trip.

223
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,816
Ask her to introduce herself.

224
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:16,846
- What's your name?
- Xiang Ning.

225
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:18,046
- Xiang Ning?
- Yes.

226
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:19,755
Her name is Xiang Ning.

227
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:20,956
(Xiang Ning, the older sister)

228
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:23,885
(Chao Shu Hao asks a question too.)

229
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:25,185
- Qing Li.
- Qing Li.

230
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:26,226
- Qing Li.
- Yes.

231
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:28,455
Are the three of you friends?

232
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:29,625
(Suddenly, he speaks in English.)

233
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:31,165
- No. She's on her own.
- Where are you from?

234
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,065
- She's Korean. She's alone.
- I see.

235
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:34,946
- She's Korean?
- Yes. She's here individually.

236
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:36,765
I work at N Seoul Tower.

237
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,335
- She was going home.
- After her shift?

238
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:40,696
- You were getting off work?
- Yes. I asked her to join us.

239
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:42,945
- Okay.
- Guys.

240
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:45,676
Now, the three partners...

241
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:47,815
will pick a rope and pull it.

242
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:51,245
The person who doesn't get chosen until the end will be...

243
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:53,016
the last one to sleep outdoors.

244
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,656
Okay.

245
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:56,976
- It's totally about our luck.
- It's about our luck.

246
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:58,566
- I need luck. Let's go.
- Go for it.

247
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:00,756
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

248
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:02,966
You can just pull it.

249
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:04,596
No pressure. Just pull it.

250
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:06,765
- We'll mix up the ropes, - No.

251
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:08,165
So no need to worry about it.

252
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,605
We can just sit down.

253
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:11,265
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- On the far left.

254
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:12,875
- I'll pick this one.
- They'll mix up the ropes.

255
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:14,935
- It doesn't matter.
- They'll mix up the ropes.

256
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:17,075
Okay. Let's keep our mood bright. Let's do it with a smile.

257
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:18,105
Okay.

258
00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:20,715
Do you want to go first? First?

259
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:22,246
(Do you want to go first?)

260
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:24,546
(Xiang Ning will pick first.)

261
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:26,686
Okay. My gosh. Here it goes!

262
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:30,056
(Who will be the first one to sleep indoors?)

263
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:33,296
Please let it be me. I want to be picked first. Please.

264
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:35,995
My gosh. I want to be picked first.

265
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:38,496
Wait. One, two,

266
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,195
three!

267
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:41,565
(Their fate lies on Xiang Ning's hands.)

268
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:42,866
- Pull it?
- Pull it hard.

269
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:47,406
(Who will it be?)

270
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:49,306
It's starting.

271
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:56,145
(Sae Ho will sleep indoors.)

272
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:57,385
- Sae Ho survives.
- For real?

273
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,015
- Gosh, this...
- Hey.

274
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,685
(He can't stop but dances.)

275
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:02,055
This is quite hurtful.

276
00:10:02,056 --> 00:10:03,086
Okay!

277
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:05,855
- I got it. Thank you.
- My gosh, no.

278
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:06,896
- Xiang Ning.
- Thank you.

279
00:10:07,526 --> 00:10:08,756
Thank you!

280
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:11,216
I'm suddenly getting nervous. I was fine before.

281
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:14,765
I got a tug around my belly.

282
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:16,836
There's a 75-percent chance that I could survive.

283
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:18,065
- Yes.
- Right.

284
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,506
Whoever doesn't get picked here must accept that...

285
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:22,976
he's an unlucky one.

286
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:25,476
Please. I made it this far. I can't sleep outside.

287
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:28,175
(I can't die like this)

288
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:29,415
Who wants to go next?

289
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,745
Her...

290
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:32,085
(Qing Li will pick next.)

291
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:33,115
Let's go.

292
00:10:33,116 --> 00:10:34,415
- We must wait.
- Pull it hard.

293
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,416
- Let's go.
- This is...

294
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:36,425
- Here it goes.
- All right.

295
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:37,885
- Wait.
- All right.

296
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:38,985
Here it goes.

297
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:40,126
(Whose rope will it be?)

298
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,595
One...

299
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:42,966
(Please let me sleep indoors.)

300
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:44,726
two,

301
00:10:45,496 --> 00:10:46,895
- three.
- My gosh. Let's go.

302
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,536
(Who will be the second one to sleep indoors?)

303
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:53,136
(Pulling it hard)

304
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:55,236
(Moving)

305
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:57,275
(I can feel it!)

306
00:10:57,276 --> 00:10:58,606
Okay!

307
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,445
(He passes out from joy.)

308
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,016
Okay!

309
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:05,716
(I can't believe this.)

310
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:07,355
Who did it?

311
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:09,686
Thank you.

312
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:10,985
- I survived, right?
- Se Yoon.

313
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,995
- Okay. Chao Shu Hao.
- Yes!

314
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:14,996
- Se Yoon survives.
- Let's go.

315
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:16,366
Okay.

316
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:19,866
All right. There's only one spot left.

317
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:22,695
The probability went down to 50 percent.

318
00:11:22,696 --> 00:11:24,405
Can I change this to Sae Ho's?

319
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:26,306
- Why?
- Can I change this to Sae Ho's?

320
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:28,135
I'm sorry. But no.

321
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:29,656
(Join us to suffer sleeping outdoors.)

322
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:33,016
Thank you. You're my hero.

323
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:36,146
I'll remember you.

324
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,045
- It's the last one!
- Good luck.

325
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:39,685
- The worker from the N Seoul Tower.
- The worker.

326
00:11:39,686 --> 00:11:41,015
- All right.
- Your shift ends pretty late.

327
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,016
Right.

328
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:45,426
Who are you rooting for to sleep indoors?

329
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:47,695
The one who brought me here.

330
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:49,256
- Joon?
- Joon.

331
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:51,695
Actually, I don't remember sleeping outdoors...

332
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:54,266
while filming the show lately.

333
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:58,266
I started to sleep indoors once I stopped trying so hard.

334
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:02,135
So I'm not that nervous right now.

335
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:04,276
I get the feeling that it won't be me.

336
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,306
I'm ready...

337
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:09,615
to sacrifice myself for Joon.

338
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:11,656
- You're making me look bad.
- He's lying for sure.

339
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,615
- He's lying for sure.
- Let's do this.

340
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,055
Let's pull it now.

341
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,385
- Did you pick one?
- Yes.

342
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:18,562
- Great. It's 1 of the 2.
- We can just have fun with it.

343
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:19,995
- Let's pull it now.
- This show is all about having fun.

344
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,756
(The probability is 50 percent now.)

345
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:25,066
It's a 50-50 chance. We can just have fun with it.

346
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,836
This show is all about having fun.

347
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:28,536
Have fun with it.

348
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:30,835
- Have fun with it and smile.
- Say, "Sleep indoors."

349
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:32,736
Pull it as you say, "Sleep indoors."

350
00:12:32,976 --> 00:12:34,035
- All right.
- It's okay.

351
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:35,736
- I must find peace.
- Are you ready?

352
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:39,406
Pull it. One, two, three.

353
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:42,444
(The rope has been pulled.)

354
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:45,528
(The rope has been pulled.)

355
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:48,828
(Who has gotten the last rope leading to sleeping indoors?)

356
00:12:49,098 --> 00:12:50,558
Two, three.

357
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:53,798
(DinDin survives.)

358
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:58,838
(Happily stamping his feet)

359
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:00,938
- Nice.
- Joon will sleep...

360
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:03,178
outdoors on Mount Nam.

361
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:05,077
- DinDin.
- It's official now!

362
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:06,878
(Joon will sleep indoors.)

363
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,518
- My gosh.
- Let's go and sleep.

364
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:10,418
I'm the Grim Reaper. Let's go.

365
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:12,048
Take him.

366
00:13:12,248 --> 00:13:13,587
(I guess I was the unlucky one.)

367
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:15,288
All right.

368
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:17,918
Jong Min, Seon Ho, and Joon...

369
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,657
- will sleep outdoors.
- Let's go down.

370
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:20,727
- Okay.
- Let's go down.

371
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:22,204
(Jong Min, Seon Ho, and Joon will sleep outdoors.)

372
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:23,698
I'll take it now.

373
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:25,928
One, two, three.

374
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:27,927
Everyone.

375
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:29,667
- This...
- This is it for today.

376
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:31,438
- Okay.
- Let's keep playing.

377
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:32,638
(He doesn't mean it.)

378
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,277
Let's head over to your sleeping spot.

379
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:37,038
We prepared a special sleeping spot for you.

380
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:38,978
- Are we really going to a hotel?
- Okay.

381
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:41,578
Thank you. Let's go.

382
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:43,017
It's going to rain a lot tonight.

383
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:44,524
- The rainfall will be 100mm.
- Let's go.

384
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:46,068
I wonder how great this place will be.

385
00:13:46,388 --> 00:13:47,718
How great is it?

386
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,357
Where are we going?

387
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:51,457
We're going to our lodging.

388
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,087
- But...
- We're traveling around Seoul.

389
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:55,128
Seoul is quite big.

390
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,797
- Seoul is big.
- This is crazy.

391
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:58,528
- Where in Seoul...
- It's not ending.

392
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:00,497
(Yawning)

393
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:02,598
- The lodging is 30 minutes away.
- Yes.

394
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:03,897
My house is also 30 minutes away...

395
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:04,938
- from here.
- Okay.

396
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:06,708
Why is it so far?

397
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:09,638
We need to visit many spots all over Seoul.

398
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:11,538
Is there a spot we haven't visited?

399
00:14:11,748 --> 00:14:13,508
Why don't we only check this place out?

400
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:15,718
- We can check that out tomorrow.
- I mean...

401
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:17,017
At this rate,

402
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:19,338
we'll be checking out a spot for our graves, Director Joo.

403
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:20,817
We didn't take any breaks.

404
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,317
- Right.
- We didn't take any breaks.

405
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:23,788
Did we not go to Gangseo-gu yet?

406
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,758
I guess today was a tough day.

407
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:28,058
It's been a while since I walked 30,000 steps.

408
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,427
Don't people walk 30,000 steps...

409
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:32,027
in a day when they go on a pilgrimage?

410
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:33,527
- Santiago?
- Don't people walk 30,000 steps...

411
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:35,088
when they go on the Camino de Santiago?

412
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:37,398
Seriously. We're traveling around Seoul.

413
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:40,008
Seoul

414
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:42,308
Seoul is a tough place to travel

415
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:45,907
(We'll drop you off at the destination soon.)

416
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:49,717
We're going to regroup first.

417
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:51,747
- Okay.
- Then we'll head over to sleep.

418
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:53,287
- Okay.
- We got it.

419
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:54,764
(They'll regroup first due to the nature of the lodging.)

420
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,757
When are we waking up tomorrow?

421
00:14:56,758 --> 00:14:59,557
Tomorrow, it will change based on...

422
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:01,387
- the weather condition.
- I see.

423
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:02,868
It's a good thing if it rains, right?

424
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:05,768
For us, it's a good thing if it doesn't rain.

425
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:07,968
It says it will rain all day.

426
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:10,468
It will rain until 3pm.

427
00:15:11,238 --> 00:15:12,707
Gosh, it has to stop raining...

428
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,508
for us to do a fun morning mission.

429
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:17,337
Look at him.

430
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:19,278
He doesn't mean that at all.

431
00:15:19,848 --> 00:15:20,977
I wasn't even paying attention.

432
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:22,877
You know what? He's changing...

433
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:24,618
Jong Min, how much energy do you have left?

434
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:27,848
You look like a man in his 60s right now.

435
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:29,557
You know what I think?

436
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:31,494
He might not even remember the Octagonal Pavilion.

437
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:32,787
He might remember what we did after watching the show.

438
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:34,057
"When did I do that?"

439
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,397
Right. That happens a lot.

440
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:36,427
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes.

441
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:37,788
(The bus continues on the road...)

442
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:40,968
(and arrives at a place to regroup.)

443
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:44,797
(While getting ready to sleep, )

444
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:47,268
(it begins to pour down even more.)

445
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,778
Hey, what's happening right now?

446
00:15:50,138 --> 00:15:52,054
I wonder why they dropped us off at the Gwangjin Bridge.

447
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:53,548
What's going on? Where are we?

448
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:55,778
- Where are we?
- The Gwangjin Bridge.

449
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:57,617
- It's...
- Hey.

450
00:15:57,618 --> 00:15:59,087
- It's the last autumn rain.
- What's going on?

451
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,817
This is crazy. Let's get going.

452
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:01,957
We won't sleep here, right?

453
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,957
- Here? How...
- There's no way.

454
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,288
We won't, right?

455
00:16:05,928 --> 00:16:08,498
- This is crazy. It's...
- We'll get going now.

456
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:10,827
- What? Let's go.
- My gosh.

457
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:12,628
- The direction is off too.
- Let's go, guys.

458
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:15,737
- There's no indoor place.
- Gwangnaru.

459
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:17,138
- I see something.
- What's this?

460
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:18,467
- What's this?
- It's cold. What's this?

461
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:19,707
- There's a place to sleep here?
- What is this?

462
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,837
- What's this?
- Is that an elevator?

463
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:22,077
- My gosh.
- I see something.

464
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:23,307
- Is this it?
- Is it a hotel?

465
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:24,337
(At that time, they spot something.)

466
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:25,648
What's this? Is it a hotel?

467
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:28,078
- What's that? The Eighth Street?
- What?

468
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:31,278
You'll be sleeping under this bridge tonight.

469
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:32,748
- Under the bridge?
- What?

470
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:34,118
- Yes.
- Why?

471
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:35,987
- Why don't we go down?
- It's...

472
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:37,317
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

473
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:39,287
- Is it a unique kind of hotel?
- What is this place?

474
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:40,927
- What's this?
- A unique kind of hotel?

475
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:42,197
- A unique kind of hotel.
- What...

476
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:43,328
It's raining a lot.

477
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:45,027
(The 8th Street on Gwangjin Bridge)

478
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:48,268
(Today's lodging is revealed at last.)

479
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:50,358
- What is this?
- Gosh, what is this place?

480
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:51,667
What is this?

481
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:53,268
(When they follow down the staircase...)

482
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,237
- What's this?
- It's under the bridge.

483
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:58,548
You know what? This is a one-of-a-kind hotel.

484
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:00,507
(Located under Gwangjin Bridge)

485
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:02,828
(The only observatory in Korea with the under-bridge view)

486
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:05,588
(The 8th Street on Gwangjin Bridge)

487
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:07,687
- Can we sleep around the river?
- Let's go in.

488
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:10,087
- It's raining a lot.
- Are we sleeping on the bridge?

489
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:11,657
- Gosh, look at the floor.
- My goodness.

490
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:13,187
- This is like sleeping outdoors.
- Gosh.

491
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:14,188
- Hold on.
- What's this?

492
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:15,704
- This is scary.
- This doesn't count as indoors.

493
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:17,028
It's so high up here.

494
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:18,967
- It's all water.
- We can see the Han River.

495
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:20,697
You can see the entire Han River.

496
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:23,267
This is called the Eighth Street on Gwangjin Bridge.

497
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:24,268
Okay.

498
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:26,207
(A popular night-view spot...)

499
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,167
(for its beautiful lights across the bridge)

500
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:31,337
This place has gotten popular through social media lately.

501
00:17:31,338 --> 00:17:32,647
- This place?
- It's on the rise...

502
00:17:32,648 --> 00:17:34,477
as a unique spot to visit.

503
00:17:34,478 --> 00:17:36,447
Right. This place looks beautiful from here.

504
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:39,247
(People can enjoy a new kind of beauty in the afternoon.)

505
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:40,347
This place is cool.

506
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:42,758
Does this count as indoors or outdoors?

507
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:44,987
- It must be indoors.
- It's the spot for indoor sleepers.

508
00:17:44,988 --> 00:17:46,057
Then they must go outside?

509
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:49,027
We have prepared a cozy spot outside.

510
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:51,257
- Oh, no.
- They will stay out of the rain.

511
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:53,197
I'd be grateful if our tent wasn't in the rain.

512
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,697
We asked where the bathroom was.

513
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:57,497
You said it was 40m away. So where is it?

514
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:59,467
- Where must we go?
- You must go up the bridge.

515
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:00,537
- What?
- My gosh.

516
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,567
- Are you for real?
- It's raining.

517
00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:02,978
Yes. You must cross the street.

518
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:04,777
- You want us to cross the street?
- Yes.

519
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:06,007
- Cross the street?
- Cross the street?

520
00:18:06,008 --> 00:18:07,848
There's a public toilet across the street.

521
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:09,848
- So...
- Are you for real?

522
00:18:10,218 --> 00:18:11,618
We all need to use the toilet.

523
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:14,417
Hey. You can't just fart like that.

524
00:18:14,418 --> 00:18:16,157
- My gosh.
- Come on.

525
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:17,717
- Why are you doing that?
- I was so startled.

526
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:19,358
- Wait.
- What is this?

527
00:18:19,988 --> 00:18:21,588
- He's too old now...
- You know what?

528
00:18:21,828 --> 00:18:23,927
- to control his sphincter muscles.
- There was no warning.

529
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:25,327
- All right.
- He just farted out in the open.

530
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:26,568
- How...
- Was it intentional?

531
00:18:26,698 --> 00:18:28,097
- Or did you not have any control?
- I didn't have any control.

532
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,137
Right. See? Let's be understanding.

533
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:31,237
(Giggling)

534
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:32,307
- Okay.
- He's getting old too.

535
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:34,437
I'll see you when the wake-up song plays tomorrow morning.

536
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:35,807
It will be super easy to hear that.

537
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:36,877
- Look at the speakers.
- The viewers...

538
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:38,037
See you tomorrow morning.

539
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:39,907
While starring on the show, I keep doing things...

540
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:41,408
- I've never done before.
- Then...

541
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:43,917
Goodnight.

542
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:45,524
(The three brothers lie down, exhausted from fatigue.)

543
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:47,648
This Seoul trip was quite tiring.

544
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,587
You know what?

545
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:50,617
(This lodging is unique even to DinDin...)

546
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:52,057
When would we have the chance to sleep above the river?

547
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:53,387
(who has been starring on the show for 6 years.)

548
00:18:53,388 --> 00:18:55,427
Right. When would we get the chance to sleep here?

549
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:56,528
(You're right.)

550
00:18:57,298 --> 00:18:58,628
Look on your left.

551
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:02,168
Our eye level is aligned at the bridge. Right?

552
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:04,797
This is fascinating.

553
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:06,137
We'd never get to see this kind of view again.

554
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:08,508
(They go to sleep with glittering lights as mood lighting.)

555
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:10,178
(Meanwhile, the members sleeping outdoors...)

556
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:11,238
Good work, everyone.

557
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:15,178
- It was a tough day.
- Right, it was.

558
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:18,318
- Goodnight.
- Yes, goodnight.

559
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,487
I love you.

560
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:20,548
- I love you.
- Gosh.

561
00:19:20,748 --> 00:19:21,917
You guys say that so easily.

562
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:23,187
It's hard for me to say that.

563
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:24,987
- I've been trying lately.
- Really?

564
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:26,158
(Opening his eyes)

565
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:27,857
It's the first time I heard Jong Min say...

566
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:29,357
- "I love you" in four years.
- My gosh.

567
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:31,557
That's pretty cool. But it still feels awkward.

568
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:33,398
You should try it too. It's making an effort.

569
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:34,728
I love you, Joon.

570
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:37,668
(Giggling)

571
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:39,878
- Why can't you say it back?
- Okay.

572
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,978
- Joon. It's making an effort.
- Thank you.

573
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:44,207
- Try it.
- Don't thank me.

574
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,148
You must say it back when I say I love you.

575
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:47,547
I love you.

576
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:50,518
(I love you.)

577
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,647
This feels weird.

578
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:54,947
Once you start doing it,

579
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:55,987
- it gets better.
- Right.

580
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,518
"I just love them."

581
00:19:57,758 --> 00:19:59,457
- That's the mindset.
- Right.

582
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,657
Then it's so natural.

583
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,297
- I love you.
- Yes, that's it.

584
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,927
You don't have to force it and try to sound sweet.

585
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:05,998
That's nice then.

586
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:07,827
- Sleep tight. I love you.
- Sleep tight.

587
00:20:07,828 --> 00:20:09,437
- I love you.
- I love you.

588
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:11,598
(We love you too.)

589
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,967
(The night lights that kept Seoul bright...)

590
00:20:13,968 --> 00:20:15,808
(have yielded their spots to the sunlight.)

591
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:19,078
(The rain subsides in no time.)

592
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:21,608
(What kind of day awaits them today?)

593
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,418
(The wake-up song plays.)

594
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:28,618
(Sae Ho wakes up as soon as the song plays.)

595
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:32,228
(He stretches first.)

596
00:20:32,828 --> 00:20:35,998
(Se Yoon and DinDin wake up after him.)

597
00:20:36,598 --> 00:20:39,298
(Half asleep)

598
00:20:39,928 --> 00:20:42,898
(Three Brothers put on their socks side by side.)

599
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:46,538
(Is it the wake-up song?)

600
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:50,238
(Those who were sleeping outdoors get up quickly.)

601
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:52,947
(The first to come out of the tent)

602
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:55,208
(It's Jong Min.)

603
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:58,618
(Joon and Seon Ho come out together.)

604
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:01,448
(His eyes aren't even open yet.)

605
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:04,258
(I'm leaving first.)

606
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,428
(Those who slept indoors come out after Jong Min.)

607
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:11,227
(Half-asleep)

608
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,398
(Everyone is up.)

609
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:18,168
(The floor is more visible in the morning.)

610
00:21:18,398 --> 00:21:19,538
- Good morning.
- Hello.

611
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:23,284
I haven't gone to the bathroom yet because it's so far.

612
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:24,478
All right.

613
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:27,707
(He also has to go.)

614
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,018
Joon also held it in.

615
00:21:30,518 --> 00:21:33,717
(Everyone has a bathroom problem.)

616
00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:36,057
I held it in at night, and it's driving me crazy.

617
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:37,287
(Suffering)

618
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:38,618
Jong Min, would you like to go?

619
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:40,428
Would you like to go?

620
00:21:40,728 --> 00:21:41,887
Shall we go?

621
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:43,328
- Go.
- That's right.

622
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:45,467
How long does it take?

623
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:47,588
(The public bathroom is about a 10-minute walk away.)

624
00:21:47,628 --> 00:21:49,797
All these staff members have to wait for you.

625
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:51,068
Look how many there are.

626
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:54,808
(What should I do?)

627
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,577
Because of you, so many of these people have to wait.

628
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:00,347
Just because you want to go relieve yourself.

629
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:02,747
He should've woken up at 8am like me and gone to the bathroom...

630
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:04,417
before the wake-up song came on.

631
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:06,488
- I woke up at 6am.
- Seriously?

632
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:10,057
(We compliment you for going to the bathroom early.)

633
00:22:10,058 --> 00:22:11,158
What?

634
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:13,588
(Flustered)

635
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:15,897
- What are you talking about?
- We did the right thing.

636
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:17,757
- Why did you ignore...
- Listen.

637
00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:20,068
- the wake-up song?
- In the middle of my sleep,

638
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:22,667
- I opened my eyes automatically.
- Me too.

639
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:24,837
The thought of making the staff wait ten minutes...

640
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:26,438
suddenly woke me up.

641
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:30,008
I couldn't let that happen, so I decided to go earlier.

642
00:22:30,238 --> 00:22:33,247
Jong Min, will you go despite everything?

643
00:22:33,248 --> 00:22:37,018
(Jong Min, will you go despite everything?)

644
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,617
- Let's go.
- Make it quick.

645
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:42,887
- Okay.
- He has to go.

646
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:44,928
- I'll go with him as his bodyguard.
- I'll go too.

647
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:46,557
I can't hold back.

648
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:47,857
(Everyone follows him.)

649
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:49,128
They're joining him quietly.

650
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:51,227
This is impossible.

651
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:53,788
(If it weren't for Jong Min, everyone would've been in trouble.)

652
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:56,468
(They come back looking refreshed.)

653
00:22:56,898 --> 00:22:58,198
I'm so glad that I went.

654
00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:00,468
Thank you.

655
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:03,608
I haven't felt this pleasure in a while.

656
00:23:04,308 --> 00:23:05,907
- Jong Min, are you okay now?
- I'm good.

657
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:06,908
All right.

658
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:09,147
Actually, we had planned a very special morning mission...

659
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:10,777
for today.

660
00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:11,778
- Okay.
- Okay.

661
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:13,447
However, it's raining a lot.

662
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:14,517
(Canceled due to the rain)

663
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,088
- Due to the rain...
- Thank goodness.

664
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,157
- So what are we going to do?
- Unfortunately,

665
00:23:20,158 --> 00:23:21,357
our plan fell through.

666
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,997
- Originally, we wanted to make...
- What?

667
00:23:22,998 --> 00:23:25,198
- Joon's dream come true.
- What is it?

668
00:23:25,598 --> 00:23:27,467
You were going to cross the Han River.

669
00:23:27,468 --> 00:23:28,997
- How would we cross it?
- By running?

670
00:23:28,998 --> 00:23:30,837
You should do it during your spare time.

671
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:32,967
You were going to make a boat.

672
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:34,607
- What?
- You had to make a boat.

673
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:35,937
- What?
- Make it?

674
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:37,308
Seriously? That's crazy.

675
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:40,608
The staff came up with another game in a hurry.

676
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:42,618
This morning mission is...

677
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:44,878
AI Music Quiz.

678
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:46,547
- "AI?"
- AI...

679
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:48,717
- That's new. What is it?
- I love it.

680
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,887
- It sounds nice and trendy.
- Yes.

681
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:50,957
The AI will...

682
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,128
briefly describe the song.

683
00:23:53,758 --> 00:23:56,728
Based on the description, you must guess which song it is.

684
00:23:57,058 --> 00:23:59,298
- It sounds fun.
- What benefits do we get?

685
00:23:59,368 --> 00:24:01,727
When you guess two questions correctly...

686
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:02,808
- What?
- Do we get to eat?

687
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,267
Isn't it too early for food?

688
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:06,367
- You get to go home immediately.
- That's incredible.

689
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:07,707
The prize is very big.

690
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,177
(Shocking)

691
00:24:09,178 --> 00:24:12,448
You'll play until four people get to go home.

692
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:13,748
- Four people?
- Yes.

693
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:14,847
What about the remaining two?

694
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,024
- Will they have to make a boat?
- The remaining two will enjoy...

695
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:18,447
- What is it?
- the refreshing weekend morning...

696
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:20,247
a little longer.

697
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:22,087
So we won't get to eat together?

698
00:24:22,088 --> 00:24:23,118
No.

699
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:25,888
- We should...
- Let's go home.

700
00:24:25,988 --> 00:24:28,587
For the first question, we picked a song...

701
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:30,458
from the 2010s.

702
00:24:30,698 --> 00:24:32,227
- From the 2010s?
- That will be difficult.

703
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:33,908
The one who answers correctly will pick...

704
00:24:34,028 --> 00:24:35,837
the year of the next song.

705
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:37,438
- Okay.
- Goodness.

706
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:39,867
The songs can be from the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s,

707
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:41,267
2010s, or 2020s.

708
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:42,677
- Okay.
- The 1990s are the best.

709
00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:44,884
- I also like the 90s the best.
- These are the options.

710
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:46,608
- It'll be hard for the others.
- Exactly.

711
00:24:47,248 --> 00:24:48,647
You're not allowed to pick...

712
00:24:48,648 --> 00:24:50,047
the same period in a row.

713
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:51,247
(Picking the same period in a row isn't allowed.)

714
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:52,887
- Are you guys ready?
- All right.

715
00:24:52,888 --> 00:24:53,888
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

716
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:55,147
- I need to go home.
- We'll start with the 2010s.

717
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:56,518
We're starting with the 2010s.

718
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:59,087
Here's the question.

719
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:00,228
(Here's the first question.)

720
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:02,998
To him who always saw her as a kid.

721
00:25:03,528 --> 00:25:04,727
- Jong Min.
- Seon Ho.

722
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:06,088
- I said my name first.
- Seon Ho.

723
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:07,728
Jong Min gets to go first.

724
00:25:08,328 --> 00:25:09,667
- It's by Lee Seung Gi.
- Yes?

725
00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:11,538
- It's from the 2010s.
- I know.

726
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:13,007
- "Because You Are My Woman."
- No way.

727
00:25:13,008 --> 00:25:14,167
Yes, that's the song.

728
00:25:14,168 --> 00:25:15,537
- That song isn't from the 2010s.
- No.

729
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:17,107
- It said "to him."
- That's from the 2000s.

730
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:19,347
It said, "To him who always saw her as a kid."

731
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:20,547
- Yes.
- Right.

732
00:25:20,548 --> 00:25:21,848
- Wrong.
- Why?

733
00:25:22,178 --> 00:25:24,258
- You always saw me as - I thought that was correct.

734
00:25:24,548 --> 00:25:26,648
- I'll let you hear it again.
- It's not "a kid."

735
00:25:27,088 --> 00:25:29,418
To him who always saw her as a kid,

736
00:25:30,318 --> 00:25:33,428
she lets him know confidently that she's changed.

737
00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:36,657
She confesses her feelings for him...

738
00:25:36,658 --> 00:25:39,268
- in this lively and lovely song.
- "To him?"

739
00:25:39,568 --> 00:25:41,067
Who is he exactly?

740
00:25:41,068 --> 00:25:42,367
- Is that all?
- Yes.

741
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:43,767
- What does it mean?
- Who is he again?

742
00:25:43,768 --> 00:25:44,867
(To him who always saw her as a kid, she lets him know...)

743
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:46,237
I thought it was "Because You Are My Woman."

744
00:25:46,238 --> 00:25:47,668
- Right?
- I mean...

745
00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:49,377
- You see me as a kid - Listen.

746
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:51,177
She's telling the guy who sees her as his little sister.

747
00:25:51,178 --> 00:25:53,624
- "Don't treat me like I'm young."
- I'm not just a young girl.

748
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:55,307
"I love you."

749
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:56,518
- That's the story.
- Exactly.

750
00:25:57,448 --> 00:25:58,848
Is it a song by...

751
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:00,248
- One more time.
- Joon?

752
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:02,317
"Girls' Generation" by Girls' Generation.

753
00:26:02,318 --> 00:26:03,657
("Girls' Generation" by Girls' Generation)

754
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:04,718
Wrong.

755
00:26:06,928 --> 00:26:08,058
- Jong Min.
- Seon Ho.

756
00:26:08,628 --> 00:26:09,628
Go ahead, Jong Min.

757
00:26:09,629 --> 00:26:11,698
- It's by Girls' Generation.
- Girls' Generation?

758
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:13,368
You know that song.

759
00:26:14,128 --> 00:26:15,808
"Don't Make Fun of Me Because I Am Young."

760
00:26:16,468 --> 00:26:17,468
Okay.

761
00:26:17,638 --> 00:26:19,167
- That's "Girls' Generation."
- Really?

762
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:20,337
- Wrong.
- Seon Ho.

763
00:26:20,338 --> 00:26:22,237
- Seon Ho?
- "Oh!" by Girls' Generation.

764
00:26:22,238 --> 00:26:23,977
("Oh!" by Girls' Generation)

765
00:26:23,978 --> 00:26:24,978
- I don't think so.
- That's right.

766
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:26,008
Correct.

767
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:27,978
I got confused this time.

768
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:31,178
(Surprisingly, Seon Ho is the first one to score.)

769
00:26:31,718 --> 00:26:33,188
(Dancing)

770
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:34,887
(To him who always saw her as a kid, )

771
00:26:34,888 --> 00:26:36,217
(she lets him know confidently that she's changed.)

772
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:38,157
(She confesses her feelings for him...)

773
00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:39,627
(in this lively and lovely song.)

774
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:40,628
- Okay.
- This time...

775
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:41,887
That was a practice.

776
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:43,827
- That's how you play.
- It was only a practice.

777
00:26:43,828 --> 00:26:44,857
That was a practice.

778
00:26:44,858 --> 00:26:46,367
- Okay.
- What are you talking about?

779
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:48,067
- It was definitely a practice.
- That's how you play.

780
00:26:48,068 --> 00:26:50,567
The answer was obviously "Oh!" by Girls' Generation.

781
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:51,638
Come on.

782
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:52,868
- Hey.
- Don't you agree?

783
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:55,007
I was staying quiet on purpose.

784
00:26:55,008 --> 00:26:56,277
What are you doing?

785
00:26:56,278 --> 00:26:58,878
- The resentful character fits you.
- Go and shave your mustache.

786
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:00,648
Do I look messy?

787
00:27:01,378 --> 00:27:02,578
- Goodness.
- All right.

788
00:27:02,718 --> 00:27:04,477
Good job on bringing up Girls' Generation.

789
00:27:04,478 --> 00:27:06,387
It was the period for Girls' Generation.

790
00:27:06,388 --> 00:27:07,848
The AI gives us a description,

791
00:27:08,388 --> 00:27:10,617
but it's easier to tell from the look on Director Joo's face.

792
00:27:10,618 --> 00:27:12,427
Along with the AI...

793
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:14,828
"Girls' Generation?" You can tell from looking at his face.

794
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:18,328
When you're half correct, the look on his face changes.

795
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:19,967
(Squirming)

796
00:27:19,968 --> 00:27:21,098
That's right.

797
00:27:21,328 --> 00:27:22,437
When your answer is correct...

798
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:23,438
(Surprised)

799
00:27:23,438 --> 00:27:24,438
(What?)

800
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:25,498
- Right.
- One more time.

801
00:27:26,238 --> 00:27:28,767
(When Joon said Girls' Generation)

802
00:27:28,768 --> 00:27:30,384
"Girls' Generation" by Girls' Generation.

803
00:27:30,408 --> 00:27:31,438
(Squirming)

804
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:33,707
(You can tell from the look that it's half correct.)

805
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:35,307
(Regretful and impressed)

806
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:37,147
- Starting from next week, - He's being helpful.

807
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:39,087
Put on a mask or something.

808
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:40,147
- Do something.
- A mask will be good for you.

809
00:27:40,148 --> 00:27:42,317
You need to control the look on your face.

810
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:43,318
(I'll keep a poker face.)

811
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,717
- I will pick...
- He makes it so obvious.

812
00:27:44,718 --> 00:27:45,718
Okay.

813
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,658
I'll pick the 2020s.

814
00:27:48,358 --> 00:27:49,727
The 2020s.

815
00:27:49,728 --> 00:27:52,628
All right, here's the question.

816
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:55,327
Between close friends...

817
00:27:55,328 --> 00:27:57,138
who know everything about each other,

818
00:27:57,498 --> 00:28:00,637
there's excitement unexpectedly.

819
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:01,867
- DinDin.
- The song captures...

820
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:02,907
- DinDin?
- What's this?

821
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:04,638
"Nonstop" by OH MY GIRL.

822
00:28:05,678 --> 00:28:06,678
Correct.

823
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:09,647
(Between close friends...)

824
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:11,277
(who know everything about each other, )

825
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:13,447
(there's excitement unexpectedly.)

826
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:16,887
(The song captures the cute fluttering of the heart.)

827
00:28:16,888 --> 00:28:18,187
- Can I guess again?
- No.

828
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:19,587
It'd be more fun if we try each decade.

829
00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:20,588
- Right.
- I disagree.

830
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:22,257
- I pick the 2010s.
- Fine.

831
00:28:22,258 --> 00:28:23,457
- That's the worst.
- The 2010s?

832
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,158
All right, here we go.

833
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:27,098
Here's the question.

834
00:28:27,698 --> 00:28:29,768
Capturing the sorrowful moments...

835
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:32,298
of longing for a distant love...

836
00:28:32,508 --> 00:28:34,507
and hearing news...

837
00:28:34,508 --> 00:28:36,638
of the lover through rumors,

838
00:28:36,908 --> 00:28:39,607
a poignant song with a repetitive chorus...

839
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:41,308
and a simple melody.

840
00:28:42,008 --> 00:28:43,817
- It's a ballad song.
- No, it can't be...

841
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:45,347
- because the chorus is repetitive.
- Really?

842
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,308
Didn't it say that it was a poignant ballad song?

843
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:49,087
No, it has a repetitive chorus.

844
00:28:49,088 --> 00:28:50,157
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min?

845
00:28:50,158 --> 00:28:51,657
Yes?

846
00:28:51,658 --> 00:28:53,258
- It said that it was repetitive.
- Yes.

847
00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:54,988
- Country Kko Kko?
- It's by SHINee.

848
00:28:55,728 --> 00:28:56,798
What?

849
00:28:58,198 --> 00:28:59,268
"Ring Ding Dong."

850
00:28:59,668 --> 00:29:01,898
- Wrong.
- Jong Min, it's a poignant song.

851
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:03,897
Can you sing "Ring Ding Dong" poignantly?

852
00:29:03,898 --> 00:29:06,237
(A poignant measure from "Ring Ding Dong")

853
00:29:06,238 --> 00:29:07,568
You'll make snakes come out.

854
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:08,808
(Never mind.)

855
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:09,838
Anyone?

856
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,307
- Could it be...
- Se Yoon.

857
00:29:11,308 --> 00:29:12,608
I don't think that's correct.

858
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:14,048
Se Yoon?

859
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,298
"Heard It Through the Grapevine" by Chang Ki Ha.

860
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:17,448
That's not it.

861
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:19,387
At some point

862
00:29:19,388 --> 00:29:20,487
That's correct.

863
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:22,718
(Correct)

864
00:29:24,288 --> 00:29:26,457
(Lip-synching perfectly)

865
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,458
That's incredible.

866
00:29:29,258 --> 00:29:32,998
(He looks exactly like Chang Ki Ha.)

867
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:37,967
("Heard It Through the Grapevine" by Kiha and The Faces)

868
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:42,707
(Capturing the sorrowful moments of longing for a distant love...)

869
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:47,977
(and hearing news of the lover through rumors)

870
00:29:47,978 --> 00:29:52,888
(a poignant song with a repetitive chorus and a simple melody)

871
00:29:53,148 --> 00:29:54,187
Okay.

872
00:29:54,188 --> 00:29:55,987
- This one was difficult.
- Where did you get a hint?

873
00:29:55,988 --> 00:29:58,657
I thought about the word "rumors." What rumors did he hear?

874
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:01,657
(The essential keyword "rumors")

875
00:30:01,658 --> 00:30:03,728
I give him credit for that.

876
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:06,728
"Heard It Through the Grapevine?" I like that song.

877
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:09,697
It was the only answer I knew.

878
00:30:09,698 --> 00:30:10,967
(It's more regretful because he could've answered it.)

879
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:12,268
A song from the 80s.

880
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:14,037
Se Yoon knows more songs from the 80s.

881
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:15,067
Fine.

882
00:30:15,068 --> 00:30:17,077
- You didn't even exist.
- It's 20 years before I was born.

883
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:18,477
- Let's keep going.
- Okay.

884
00:30:18,478 --> 00:30:20,178
Here's the question.

885
00:30:20,848 --> 00:30:23,547
Amid dazzling lights and nonstop music...

886
00:30:23,548 --> 00:30:25,677
at a late-night party...

887
00:30:25,678 --> 00:30:26,747
- DinDin.
- upon seeing...

888
00:30:26,748 --> 00:30:28,188
a loved one in a different light...

889
00:30:28,488 --> 00:30:29,488
It's "That Dance in the Rhythm..."

890
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:30,987
- by Kim Wan Sun.
- That's right.

891
00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:31,397
- Oh, right.
- Jong Min.

892
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:33,397
It's "That Dance in the Rhythm" by Kim Wan Sun.

893
00:30:33,905 --> 00:30:34,974
- Wrong.
- Jong Min.

894
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:36,834
- Jong Min?
- "Masquerade" by Kim Wan Sun.

895
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,004
("Masquerade" by Kim Wan Sun)

896
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,005
Wrong.

897
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:40,544
- It's not by Kim Wan Sun.
- Okay.

898
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:41,785
- We'll listen.
- We'll listen.

899
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:44,644
- From the beginning.
- Amid dazzling lights...

900
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:47,815
and nonstop music of a late-night party,

901
00:30:48,255 --> 00:30:50,814
upon seeing a loved one in a different light,

902
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:54,024
a feeling of jealousy, loneliness, and frustration is...

903
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:55,624
- expressed with honesty.
- Sae Ho.

904
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:56,855
Feeling depressed alone...

905
00:30:57,225 --> 00:30:59,125
"Story of Last Night" by Sobangcha.

906
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,264
It's correct.

907
00:31:01,265 --> 00:31:02,265
(Looking at the lights)

908
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:03,334
(Spinning round and round)

909
00:31:03,335 --> 00:31:04,865
Sae Ho, that's correct.

910
00:31:05,605 --> 00:31:08,135
(It's finally Cho Sae Ho's dance time.)

911
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,975

(Bam, bam)

914
00:31:16,945 --> 00:31:19,245
(He lets himself go to the music and the lyrics.)

915
00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:23,714
Go down to the floor.

916
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,985
(The ending pose is coming up.)

917
00:31:25,225 --> 00:31:26,685
(There it is.)

918
00:31:27,055 --> 00:31:28,154
(AI Music Quiz Current Score)

919
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:29,254
He's good.

920
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:30,495
- All right.
- Nice.

921
00:31:30,795 --> 00:31:32,194
- I give him credit.
- Me too.

922
00:31:32,195 --> 00:31:33,325
This is great.

923
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:36,365
- Goodness.
- This is great.

924
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:37,564
Sae Ho.

925
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:38,705
Let's go for the 1990s.

926
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:40,605
- Is that what you want?
- Yes.

927
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:41,834
- Is that what you want?
- It is.

928
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:43,674
Let's go, the 1990s.

929
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:44,945
All right.

930
00:31:45,545 --> 00:31:47,975
(In despair)

931
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:49,514
This is my only hope.

932
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:50,674
I gave you a chance.

933
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,015
Everyone is good at this.

934
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:53,285
Give us the question.

935
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,684
Despite the other's mischief and tricks,

936
00:31:55,685 --> 00:31:57,954
the singer tries to protect her heart.

937
00:31:57,955 --> 00:32:01,454
She won't hesitate to walk away the moment their pure love is betrayed.

938
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:04,354
It's a bold and honest love song...

939
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,524
with a playful yet subtle warning.

940
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,525
- Sae Ho.
- Se Yoon.

941
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:08,534
Se Yoon?

942
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:10,565
(Se Yoon was faster by a split second.)

943
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,535
(If he answers correctly, he'll get to go home.)

944
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,235
"Eve's Warning" by Park Mi Kyung.

945
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,604
- I was going to say that.
- Okay, I get to go home.

946
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,004
- Correct.
- I knew it.

947
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:24,075
(Let's go, dancing machines.)

948
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,685

(Let me join you.)

00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:31,554
(Fantastic teamwork)

951
00:32:31,555 --> 00:32:34,254
You're good at it. Do it one more time.

952
00:32:34,255 --> 00:32:36,555
(Their excitement is exploding.)

953
00:32:39,265 --> 00:32:41,664
(Despite the other's mischief and tricks, the singer tries...)

954
00:32:41,665 --> 00:32:43,934
(to protect her heart. She won't hesitate to walk away...)

955
00:32:43,935 --> 00:32:46,634
(the moment their pure love is betrayed. It's a bold and honest...)

956
00:32:46,635 --> 00:32:49,035
(love song with a playful yet subtle warning.)

957
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:50,735
As a result,

958
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:53,504
- Se Yoon gets to go home.
- Oh, my.

959
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:54,505
I knew it.

960
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:56,444
That's nice.

961
00:32:56,445 --> 00:32:57,514
To the 2000s.

962
00:32:57,515 --> 00:32:58,844
- I knew that.
- Let's go.

963
00:32:58,845 --> 00:33:00,385
I didn't even get a chance.

964
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:04,984
Racing forward with a pounding heart and a mic in hand,

965
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:08,495
it's a hip-hop song that explodes with youthful energy.

966
00:33:09,495 --> 00:33:11,024
- I know this song.
- Is that all?

967
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:12,165
I know.

968
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:13,425
I know this song.

969
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:16,395
- It's from 2002.
- DinDin. Okay.

970
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:18,004
M-I-C.

971
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:19,864
Hot, it's hot

972
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:20,865
"Hot" by 1TYM.

973
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,505
- 1TYM.
- My mic I hold in my hand

00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:25,174
(How did he get it right?)

975
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:26,844
- DinDin.
- Here comes DinDin.

976
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:28,614
- Correct.
- All right.

977
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:29,891
(I must answer it if it's a hip-hop song.)

978
00:33:29,915 --> 00:33:31,144
Good job.

979
00:33:31,145 --> 00:33:33,214
(Rapper DinDin, come on.)

980
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:35,714
(Racing forward with a pounding heart and a mic in hand, )

981
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:38,055
(it's a hip-hop song that explodes with youthful energy.)

982
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:41,724
Goodness.

(The heat in this place is also hot.)

986
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:55,934
They're way too good.

987
00:33:55,935 --> 00:33:57,474
- They're good.
- I can't compete.

988
00:33:57,475 --> 00:33:59,374
(They probably won't go home today.)

989
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:01,614
- DinDin gets to go home.
- Gosh, I always get confused.

990
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:04,114
(DinDin gets to go home.)

991
00:34:04,115 --> 00:34:05,284
DinDin.

992
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:06,845
Can you pick either the 2010s or 2020s?

993
00:34:07,215 --> 00:34:09,591
- Joon didn't get a chance.
- Joon, which decade do you want?

994
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,214
The 2010s.

995
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,284
- The 2010s.
- The 2010s?

996
00:34:12,285 --> 00:34:13,285
- Okay.
- Okay.

997
00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:14,684
Please.

998
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,125
(DinDin picked the 2010s for Joon.)

999
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:19,825
It captures the fluttering feeling and heart-racing thrill...

1000
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:23,995
of falling in love at first sight.

1001
00:34:24,435 --> 00:34:26,434
It's an upbeat song that expresses...

1002
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:28,934
love and beating of the heart...

1003
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:30,674
at the smallest charm...

1004
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:33,475
in the eyes, voice, or a gesture.

1005
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:34,705
It sounds familiar.

1006
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:37,174
(It captures the fluttering feeling and heart-racing thrill...)

1007
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,645
I wish I could show them the dance.

1008
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:40,014
Is there a dance to it?

1009
00:34:40,015 --> 00:34:41,791
- How do you know the answer?
- Can he give them a dance hint?

1010
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:42,815
Give us a dance hint.

1011
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,584
I have to ask him if my guess is right.

1012
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:46,725
I think it's correct. It must be right.

1013
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,094
- It's correct.
- Gosh.

1014
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:51,054
How do you know the answer based on the description?

1015
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:54,165
The title is in the description.

1017
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:00,234
(It captures the fluttering feeling and heart-racing thrill...)

1018
00:35:00,235 --> 00:35:02,374

00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:07,574
Should I do a skit as a hint?

1021
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:09,215
- Give us a skit as a hint.
- A skit.

1022
00:35:09,515 --> 00:35:11,984
I'm the main character of this song. I got it.

1023
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,865
- Do you also act?
- Se Yoon, stand over there.

1024
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:15,885
I'm the lead.

1025
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:18,365
- He's the male lead.
- I'm the male lead.

Am I looking at you?

00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:21,595
- Just stand there.
- I'll relax.

(What do we say in this situation?)

00:35:32,635 --> 00:35:34,264

- What's this?
- "Heart Attack" by AOA.

1034
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:39,374
- Correct.
- Goodness, Joon.

This is...

The quiz is very difficult.

1041
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:50,084
- As a result...
- It's very difficult.

1042
00:35:50,085 --> 00:35:51,455
The 3 of us get 1 point each.

1043
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:54,454
Jong Min must feel pressured to compete with younger members.

1044
00:35:54,455 --> 00:35:55,954
- Joon is the best.
- Yes.

1045
00:35:55,955 --> 00:35:57,701
- He's looking at the big picture.
- I'll pick the 90s.

1046
00:35:57,725 --> 00:35:58,995
Joon is amazing.

1047
00:35:59,295 --> 00:36:00,865
Does Jong Min have to answer first?

00:36:00,965 --> 00:36:02,964
- Does he have to answer 1st?
- Take a guess 1st, Jong Min.

1049
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:04,095
Okay.

1050
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,634
- Is it the 1990s?
- The fluttering excitement...

1051
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:08,734
- Jong Min.
- of going on a blind date...

1052
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:10,215
- Why are you in a hurry?
- Jong Min.

1053
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:12,381
You should've listened. They let you answer first.

1054
00:36:12,405 --> 00:36:13,844
- I know.
- What's wrong with you?

1055
00:36:13,845 --> 00:36:14,975
Who are you competing with?

1056
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,475
With himself.

1057
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,085
Can I listen to it more?

1058
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:22,114
Who are you competing with?

1059
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:23,785
Sae Ho. He lost his chance.

1060
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:27,584
- You said that I could go first.
- Hurry up and answer. Five,

1061
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,224
- four.
- What are you doing?

1062
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:30,755
- Fight.
- Wait a minute.

1063
00:36:30,825 --> 00:36:31,924
Darn it.

1064
00:36:31,925 --> 00:36:32,994
(A hand-to-hand fight between men in their 40s)

1065
00:36:32,995 --> 00:36:34,295
I'm also married.

1066
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,294
- I'm also married and old.
- Hey.

1067
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:37,295
(Quarreling)

1068
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:38,665
On a blind date after a long time?

1069
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:41,004
- Can we hear more?
- All right.

1070
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:42,835
- Four.
- On a blind date after a long time?

1071
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,305
- Three.
- It's by DJ DOC.

1072
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:48,145
Jong Min.

1073
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:51,785
- I'll let you think again.
- Sae Ho.

1074
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:53,814
- Let's give him three seconds.
- Three,

1075
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:56,714
- I think he's wrong.
- two, one. Let's go.

1076
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,684
- But...
- Are you not going to answer?

1077
00:36:58,685 --> 00:37:00,084
- Okay.
- All right, Sae Ho.

1078
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:01,124
- "Okay?"
- Sae Ho.

1079
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,724
- Sae Ho?
- Here's an exciting song.

1080
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:04,925
"Match Made in Heaven" by Solid. It's party time.

1081
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:08,434
- In the rap...
- Sae Ho is correct.

1082
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:09,694
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1083
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:10,695
(Sae Ho is correct.)

1084
00:37:10,735 --> 00:37:12,735
Why isn't the music playing?

1085
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:16,304
What's going on?

1086
00:37:16,305 --> 00:37:17,305
(Fish Cho is thriving in water.)

1087
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:18,374
This is it.

1088
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,745
(Fish Kim joins him.)

1089
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:23,175
(Hands and feet in sync)

1090
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:27,085
(Despite their bickering, they dance together.)

1091
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,014
They're really good.

1092
00:37:29,015 --> 00:37:30,184
(A chaotic dance duo)

1093
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:31,315
They missed it.

1094
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:34,454
- I'm sorry about what I did.
- Why you...

1095
00:37:34,455 --> 00:37:36,195
(They make up at the end.)

1096
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:39,825
He's really good. How did he get it after hearing that?

1097
00:37:40,295 --> 00:37:43,664
(A song about going out on a blind date...)

1098
00:37:43,665 --> 00:37:46,934
(filled with excitement and anticipation, )

1099
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:49,804
(only to find out that the date is someone familiar, )

1100
00:37:49,805 --> 00:37:53,575
(causing both of them to laugh in surprise)

1101
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,075
- Sae Ho gets to go home.
- Okay.

1102
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:57,714
If one of us answers correctly, it'll be over.

1103
00:37:57,715 --> 00:37:59,484
Yes, but Jong Min didn't get any right.

1104
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,514
That can't be helped.

1105
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:02,754
I'll give Jong Min one more chance.

1106
00:38:02,755 --> 00:38:03,985
Pick the 1980s.

1107
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:07,624
- I'll pick the 1980s.
- All right.

1108
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:08,924
- Then...
- I gave him another chance.

1109
00:38:08,925 --> 00:38:11,325
If I get it right, all three of us will be even.

1110
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:13,224
I must answer it no matter what.

1111
00:38:13,225 --> 00:38:14,565
(Determined)

1112
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:18,134
A boy meets her by chance...

1113
00:38:18,135 --> 00:38:20,265
and is instantly captivated by her eyes and beauty.

1114
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:24,675
His heart races as he longs to confess, but lacking courage,

1115
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:28,545
he calls himself a fool. It's a song that confesses his innocent love.

1116
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:29,715
Right.

1117
00:38:30,315 --> 00:38:32,245
How do you not know this?

1118
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:33,514
You don't know this song?

1119
00:38:33,515 --> 00:38:34,515
(The answer is in the description.)

1120
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:35,655
Seriously?

1121
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,385
It's a song that I love.

1122
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,455
- He calls himself a fool.
- Gosh.

1123
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,594
- It's a song that confesses...
- I'm a fool.

1124
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:43,694
You don't know?

1125
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:45,765
- He's calling himself a fool.
- A fool.

1126
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,124
I don't know who the singer is.

1127
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,064
You might not know the singer.

1128
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:50,734
Did he confess his love?

1129
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:52,241
(A boy is instantly captivated by her eyes and beauty...)

1130
00:38:52,265 --> 00:38:55,175
(Here's a special hint to go home quickly.)

1131
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:56,874
- I'll give you the obvious hint.
- Okay.

1132
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,304
- You have to be quick.
- It's about speed.

1133
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:01,005
- We'll go all out.
- One, two, three, four.

1134
00:39:01,075 --> 00:39:03,274
(Singing the beat)

1135
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:04,275
(Grunt)

1136
00:39:05,115 --> 00:39:06,215
- This...
- I got it.

1137
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:10,085
(He finally got their hint.)

1138
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:11,685
- Isn't that right?
- Jong Min?

1139
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:13,685
"A Chance Encounter" by Songolmae.

1140
00:39:14,155 --> 00:39:15,424
- That's right.
- I didn't know.

1141
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:16,425
- Correct.
- Yes.

1142
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:19,664
It said "a boy meets her by chance" in the beginning.

1143
00:39:19,665 --> 00:39:22,694
(A boy meets her by chance and is instantly captivated...)

1144
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:25,304
(by her eyes and beauty.)

1145
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:28,164
(His heart races as he longs to confess, but lacking courage, )

1146
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:31,174
(he calls himself a fool. A song that confesses his innocent love)

1147
00:39:31,175 --> 00:39:32,275
Here it is.

1148
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:34,275
Please get ready.

1149
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:35,975
Here it comes.

1150
00:39:36,945 --> 00:39:39,614
(Imitating guitar strumming sound)

1151
00:39:39,615 --> 00:39:40,615
(Exclaiming)

1152
00:39:41,785 --> 00:39:43,154
(Every hint was perfect.)

1153
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:44,395
- Nice. Thank you.
- All right.

1154
00:39:45,285 --> 00:39:47,124
- We'll have one round left.
- This is the last question.

1155
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:49,601
- It's a tie. This is the last one.
- But I get to pick which decade.

1156
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:50,625
- That's right.
- Right.

1157
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:52,264
I've only gotten one question right.

1158
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,341
(It's time for everyone to focus.)

1159
00:39:53,365 --> 00:39:54,525
Which decade should I choose?

1160
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,034
- Will you be...
- To be fair...

1161
00:39:56,035 --> 00:39:58,195
Will you be at a disadvantage if you choose the 2010s?

1162
00:39:58,565 --> 00:39:59,864
I'll be at a disadvantage,

1163
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,164
but the three of us can compete fairly.

1164
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,734
- To be fair and square.
- Yes.

1165
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:04,074
- Okay.
- Jong Min...

1166
00:40:04,075 --> 00:40:05,274
- Make your decision wisely.
- It's difficult.

1167
00:40:05,275 --> 00:40:06,651
- He's so cool. Are you serious?
- Then...

1168
00:40:06,675 --> 00:40:09,314
- I'll choose the 2010s.
- Really?

1169
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:12,514
The promotion activities for my last album ended in the 2010s.

1170
00:40:12,515 --> 00:40:13,515
Really?

1171
00:40:13,785 --> 00:40:15,814
He really is mature as the oldest member.

1172
00:40:15,815 --> 00:40:17,175
(The truly reliable oldest member)

1173
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:19,525
Here goes the question.

1174
00:40:19,526 --> 00:40:20,554
(Here goes the last question.)

1175
00:40:20,555 --> 00:40:22,924
- Question, please.
- The song is about confronting...

1176
00:40:22,925 --> 00:40:24,994
those who judge a person based on the appearance and actions...

1177
00:40:24,995 --> 00:40:26,801
- in a humorous way.
- It's the lyrics of the song.

1178
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:29,994
It's also about showing the different sides of a person...

1179
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:32,335
honestly and confidently.

1180
00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:34,464
The song emphasizes the importance...

1181
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,225
- of originality and identity.
- "Identity."

1182
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,204
- This one is difficult.
- "Identity?"

1183
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:40,181
(The last question is more difficult than they expected.)

1184
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:42,244
The first sentence is almost the same as the lyrics.

1185
00:40:42,245 --> 00:40:43,344
(The song emphasizes the importance of originality and identity.)

1186
00:40:43,345 --> 00:40:44,844
- The first sentence.
- What was it?

1187
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:45,914
(The song is about confronting those who judge a person...)

1188
00:40:45,915 --> 00:40:47,314
(based on the appearance and actions in a humorous way.)

1189
00:40:47,315 --> 00:40:48,555
- I'll give you a hint.
- Okay.

1190
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:51,215
- It's a song by a girl group.
- A girl group?

1191
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:54,085
Joon must know a lot of songs from the 2010s.

1192
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,424
I'm trying to think of... Goodness. Seriously.

1193
00:40:57,425 --> 00:40:58,425
(He has no idea.)

1194
00:40:58,426 --> 00:40:59,794
How about I tell you the release date too?

1195
00:40:59,795 --> 00:41:00,795
- Yes, please.
- The release date?

1196
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:01,795
We might still have no idea.

1197
00:41:01,796 --> 00:41:04,065
- It was released...
- Yes?

1198
00:41:04,265 --> 00:41:05,865
On July 1, 2010.

1199
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,604
- July 1, 2010?
- It's a summer song.

1200
00:41:07,605 --> 00:41:09,404
- In 2010...
- It was summer.

1201
00:41:09,405 --> 00:41:10,405
My group released "Y" in that year.

1202
00:41:10,406 --> 00:41:12,304
(The working period overlaps with Joon's?)

1203
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:13,745
I can definitely get this one right.

1204
00:41:14,745 --> 00:41:17,775
(When MBLAQ was promoting their song "Y,")

1205
00:41:18,845 --> 00:41:22,815
(this girl group was also promoting their song.)

1206
00:41:23,015 --> 00:41:25,115
- I don't know either.
- I must've met them.

1207
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,945
- Right. Joon must have met them.
- July 1, 2010.

1208
00:41:29,055 --> 00:41:30,094
Joon.

1209
00:41:30,095 --> 00:41:31,725
(Joon will answer.)

1210
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:33,564
- I'll just take a wild guess.
- Go ahead.

1211
00:41:33,565 --> 00:41:35,065
"Bad Girl Good Girl" by miss A.

1212
00:41:37,135 --> 00:41:39,965
(If it's correct, Joon will go home.)

1213
00:41:40,035 --> 00:41:41,874
- You say I'm a bad girl - Correct.

1214
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,704
(Joon got the correct answer.)

1215
00:41:43,705 --> 00:41:45,005
I took a wild guess.

1216
00:41:45,775 --> 00:41:46,815
I remember the dance move.

1217
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:48,775
This is the dance move.

1218
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:49,816
(The signature dance move)

1219
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,814
What is he doing? He's working out.

1220
00:41:51,815 --> 00:41:52,884
(It's a little bit different.)

1221
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:53,914
- Right?
- This is the dance move.

1222
00:41:53,915 --> 00:41:55,615
Owl number three, move forward.

1223
00:41:56,085 --> 00:41:58,185
You made it! You can go home.

1224
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:02,424
(The song is about confronting those who judge a person...)

1225
00:42:02,425 --> 00:42:06,194
(based on the appearance and actions in a humorous way.)

1226
00:42:06,195 --> 00:42:07,994
(It's also about showing the different sides of a person...)

1227
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:09,364
(honestly and confidently.)

1228
00:42:09,365 --> 00:42:12,135
(The song emphasizes the importance of originality and identity.)

1229
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:14,765
The AI practically paraphrased the lyrics.

1230
00:42:15,835 --> 00:42:17,404
It really is the same as the lyrics.

1231
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:18,481
(When you know the answer, it's a very easy question.)

1232
00:42:18,505 --> 00:42:20,404
As a result,

1233
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,874
Se Yoon, DinDin,

1234
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:24,545
Sae Ho, and Joon...

1235
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,314
will go home.

1236
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:28,414
I can't believe I can go home now.

1237
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:29,785
- Let's go!
- All right.

1238
00:42:30,055 --> 00:42:31,285
I feel bad for some reason.

1239
00:42:31,955 --> 00:42:34,225
- I just took a wild guess.
- Where are these two going?

1240
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,394
As for the rest...

1241
00:42:36,395 --> 00:42:37,794
- I feel bad.
- That's good.

1242
00:42:37,795 --> 00:42:39,294
Stay with us...

1243
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:41,364
- and enjoy...
- Crowded streets make Seoul lively.

1244
00:42:41,365 --> 00:42:42,434
The refreshing weekend morning...

1245
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,394
for a little longer before going home.

1246
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,904
I guess you'll go for a run. It's refreshing.

1247
00:42:45,905 --> 00:42:47,785
By the way, Jong Min did a great job this week.

1248
00:42:48,135 --> 00:42:50,104
- He did a great job this week.
- He made our show fun to watch.

1249
00:42:50,105 --> 00:42:51,635
It was legendary.

1250
00:42:51,805 --> 00:42:52,874
Seoul equals me.

1251
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,305
(Seoul equals me.)

1252
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:55,414
Jong Min looks dashing though.

1253
00:42:55,415 --> 00:42:58,415
(He placed 1st at the fashion show.)

1254
00:42:59,385 --> 00:43:01,345
(He made great jokes.)

1255
00:43:02,555 --> 00:43:05,524
(He showcased great acting skills.)

1256
00:43:05,525 --> 00:43:06,725
I am electric shock style

1257
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:09,194
(He also gave a good laugh.)

1258
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:11,125
(But...)

1259
00:43:11,795 --> 00:43:13,565
(He had to take the subway.)

1260
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,235
(He had to ride a bicycle.)

1261
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,065
(He even slept outdoors.)

1262
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,405
(He's done everything he could do in Seoul.)

1263
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:25,275
I wonder what we'll do.

1264
00:43:25,445 --> 00:43:26,744
- What will we do?
- Is there anything we can do here?

1265
00:43:26,745 --> 00:43:27,921
(Now it's time for him to shine for the last time.)

1266
00:43:27,945 --> 00:43:29,015
What is that?

1267
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:31,174
I guess we'll work out.

1268
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,615
(What is waiting for the members who will get off work late?)

1269
00:43:33,885 --> 00:43:36,855
(A random Tae Bo video?)

1270
00:43:37,385 --> 00:43:39,145
Isn't this Cho Hye Lyun's old workout video?

1271
00:43:39,655 --> 00:43:40,724
I think it was released a very long time ago.

1272
00:43:40,725 --> 00:43:42,885
(Today's getting-off-work mission: Try Tae Bo Workout)

1273
00:43:43,425 --> 00:43:45,054
(Let's do some cardio exercise on an empty stomach!)

1274
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:46,295
- Should we begin now?
- Yes.

1275
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:48,164
Hello, everyone. It's nice to meet you all.

1276
00:43:48,165 --> 00:43:49,495
- Hello.
- Hello.

1277
00:43:49,565 --> 00:43:52,934
- You'll enter the world of Tae Bo.
- Tae Bo?

1278
00:43:52,935 --> 00:43:55,774
You just have to do as I do for 26 minutes.

1279
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,775
Twenty-six minutes?

1280
00:43:56,776 --> 00:43:58,175
(It's 26 minutes long.)

1281
00:43:58,275 --> 00:44:01,904
Now, let's enter the exciting world...

1282
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,014
of Tae Bo.

1283
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,345
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1284
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:05,884
Let's go. Party time.

1285
00:44:05,885 --> 00:44:07,545
(If I can't avoid it, I'll enjoy it.)

1286
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:08,654
Do it once and...

1287
00:44:08,655 --> 00:44:10,154
(Enthusiastic)

1288
00:44:10,155 --> 00:44:11,685
Move to the right once, and then...

1289
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,454
(They're enjoying the refreshing morning with Hye Lyun.)

1290
00:44:13,455 --> 00:44:14,935
- To the back.
- Now, the other side.

1291
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:17,495
- Make the noise like me. Hoo, ha.
- Ha!

1292
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:19,325
Hoo, ha. Keep going.

1293
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:20,964
- This is good exercise.
- Keep going.

1294
00:44:20,965 --> 00:44:22,405
- I'm tired.
- My arms hurt so much.

1295
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:25,734
- You can stop here.
- I'm exhausted.

1296
00:44:25,735 --> 00:44:26,764
(Getting-off-work mission complete)

1297
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,774
- Go home safely.
- You too. Great job.

1298
00:44:28,775 --> 00:44:29,775
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

1299
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:31,411
(The next trip will continue right away.)

1300
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:35,175
(2 Days 1 Night)

1301
00:44:35,645 --> 00:44:40,415
(Two days before the shoot)

1302
00:44:40,885 --> 00:44:41,885
(The notice of the trip)

1303
00:44:41,886 --> 00:44:42,914
(How are you all? We'll begin this trip in an unusual way.)

1304
00:44:42,915 --> 00:44:44,084
(Two of you will do the opening the day before the shoot.)

1305
00:44:44,085 --> 00:44:45,085
(The two lucky members will be selected shortly!)

1306
00:44:45,086 --> 00:44:48,754
(Director Joo suddenly sent a notice in the group chat.)

1307
00:44:48,755 --> 00:44:49,854
(Sae Ho: Is being selected a good thing?)

1308
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:52,595
(Jong Min: Oh, my gosh. I think it's a good thing.)

1309
00:44:52,665 --> 00:44:53,665
(Se Yoon: I'm praying now, which I haven't done in a while.)

1310
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,024
(Joon: Is this a good thing? I can't figure it out yet.)

1311
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,164
(Joon: Maybe it's all a trick.)

1312
00:44:56,165 --> 00:44:58,035
(In the midst of excitement and doubts...)

1313
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:04,005
- Hi.
- Have you been well, Jong Min?

1314
00:45:04,405 --> 00:45:05,675
- I've been great.
- Good.

1315
00:45:06,145 --> 00:45:07,444
I've been doing well.

1316
00:45:07,445 --> 00:45:09,175
- But what's going on?
- Okay. First...

1317
00:45:10,045 --> 00:45:12,084
What's up? Why are we on a video call?

1318
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,085
Have you been well?

1319
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:16,255
What's this? It reminds me of the movie "Saw."

1320
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,654
- We're going to...
- What are you doing, Jong Hyun?

1321
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:19,655
Sorry?

1322
00:45:19,825 --> 00:45:20,984
- What?
- Can you see me?

1323
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:21,985
What?

1324
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,094
Do I really look like this?

1325
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,125
- Sorry?
- Look at this.

1326
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:27,115
Hold on. I look so weird. Why does my face look distorted?

1327
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,305
- Hang on a second.
- Okay.

1328
00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:30,234
Is this... Do I look okay?

1329
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:31,764
(Joon, at the gym, checks his appearance.)

1330
00:45:31,765 --> 00:45:32,765
I look weird.

1331
00:45:33,365 --> 00:45:34,705
- Hello?
- Hi.

1332
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,605
- Hi. I haven't eaten yet.
- Hi.

1333
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:41,744
- How have you been?
- Stars always eat in their cars.

1334
00:45:41,745 --> 00:45:42,745
(DinDin the Star eats in his car.)

1335
00:45:42,746 --> 00:45:44,044
- All right.
- I haven't eaten yet.

1336
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:45,745
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

1337
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:49,084
Just get right to the point. I haven't eaten yet.

1338
00:45:49,085 --> 00:45:50,085
Okay.

1339
00:45:50,155 --> 00:45:52,954
As we informed you before,

1340
00:45:52,955 --> 00:45:56,925
only two members will be on a special trip one day ahead.

1341
00:45:58,095 --> 00:45:59,825
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1342
00:46:00,025 --> 00:46:02,294
You said it would be a special trip.

1343
00:46:02,295 --> 00:46:03,965
Do you mean it will be exciting?

1344
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:07,264
Will those members lucky to be chosen or not?

1345
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,305
You're lucky to be part of whatever we do.

1346
00:46:10,275 --> 00:46:11,435
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1347
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,775
Oh, gosh. I hope I won't be chosen.

1348
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:17,375
All right.

1349
00:46:18,015 --> 00:46:19,814
(Dumbfounded)

1350
00:46:19,815 --> 00:46:21,945
- But this is... I mean...
- Yes?

1351
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,955
What's so special about it?

1352
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:27,555
I'm not sure if it's a good thing to be chosen.

1353
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:29,755
- Are you filming this right now?
- That's right.

1354
00:46:31,025 --> 00:46:32,594
Then pretend there's no camera around you...

1355
00:46:32,595 --> 00:46:34,724
and tell me if it's a good thing or not.

1356
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,211
- You can't tell me that, right?
- No.

1357
00:46:36,235 --> 00:46:38,041
But I'm already scheduled for work on the day before the shoot.

1358
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:41,404
We did what we could do to make it work for everyone.

1359
00:46:41,405 --> 00:46:42,581
(We adjusted their schedules beforehand.)

1360
00:46:42,605 --> 00:46:45,605
But it conflicts the title of our show.

1361
00:46:46,005 --> 00:46:48,151
- It's a special case.
- It should be 3 Days 2 Nights.

1362
00:46:48,175 --> 00:46:50,215
We've been on a one-day trip before.

1363
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:54,085
(That's true.)

1364
00:46:55,815 --> 00:46:57,584
It'd be great if I could start shooting one day ahead.

1365
00:46:57,585 --> 00:47:00,265
(The member who's been on the show for 18 years accepts it calmly.)

1366
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:01,585
- I'm already excited.
- Good.

1367
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:04,925
We'll play ghost leg game to choose two members.

1368
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:07,425
- Ghost leg?
- Yes.

1369
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:10,735
(They'll play ghost leg game.)

1370
00:47:10,865 --> 00:47:13,335
(The 2 winners will leave 1 day ahead.)

1371
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:15,015
What number would you like to choose?

1372
00:47:15,605 --> 00:47:17,005
(Hesitating)

1373
00:47:17,475 --> 00:47:18,605
What number should I pick?

1374
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:19,744
(Now that he has to choose, he gets nervous.)

1375
00:47:19,745 --> 00:47:20,875
This is driving me nuts.

1376
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,544
- I'll go with number 5.
- Number 5?

1377
00:47:23,545 --> 00:47:25,584
(Lose, win, lose, lose, lose, win)

1378
00:47:25,585 --> 00:47:26,745
You will go with number five?

1379
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:29,554
(Is it a bad one?)

1380
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,755
I'll pick number three.

1381
00:47:30,985 --> 00:47:33,985
- Number 3? Are you sure?
- Number 3!

1382
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,595
Number three.

1383
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:38,695
Number three, it is.

1384
00:47:42,165 --> 00:47:43,334
I lost.

1385
00:47:43,335 --> 00:47:45,364
(He lost.)

1386
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,434
What a shame!

1387
00:47:46,435 --> 00:47:47,565
(He means he's relieved.)

1388
00:47:47,705 --> 00:47:51,575
Jong Min, you will start the shoot on Friday.

1389
00:47:51,675 --> 00:47:54,345
You should never tell the other members.

1390
00:47:54,475 --> 00:47:55,504
Got it.

1391
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,515
It's sad. I hoped to be on the trip one day ahead.

1392
00:47:58,115 --> 00:48:00,384
(He doesn't mean that.)

1393
00:48:00,385 --> 00:48:02,554
- All right.
- Okay.

1394
00:48:02,555 --> 00:48:03,915
- Bye.
- See you then.

1395
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:05,455
What number would you like to pick?

1396
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:09,424
(After that, the other members chose numbers too.)

1397
00:48:09,425 --> 00:48:11,355
- I pick number 6.
- Number 6?

1398
00:48:11,495 --> 00:48:13,895
Fine, it's not me. Number five, it is.

1399
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,034
- I pick number 1.
- Okay. You're number 1.

1400
00:48:17,035 --> 00:48:18,035
Number one.

1401
00:48:18,036 --> 00:48:19,711
- You picked number 1.
- My goal is to be number 1.

1402
00:48:19,735 --> 00:48:21,904
I hope I'll lose. So I'll go with number four.

1403
00:48:21,905 --> 00:48:23,004
Number four.

1404
00:48:23,005 --> 00:48:24,605
I'll go with number two.

1405
00:48:26,245 --> 00:48:28,775
(Among the 5 members, who could be the winners?)

1406
00:48:32,145 --> 00:48:35,314
(9pm, the next day)

1407
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:39,084
(At a place where it's dark)

1408
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:41,325
(A celebrity's car appears at the rendezvous point.)

1409
00:48:43,825 --> 00:48:45,995
(Who could be the first winner?)

1410
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:48,224
(Someone will be forced to be on a 3-day trip.)

1411
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:50,835
- Number one. Here we go.
- Okay.

1412
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,365
(Sighing)

1413
00:48:54,305 --> 00:48:56,975
(Who could be the winner?)

1414
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:03,075
(The first winner: Joon)

1415
00:49:04,145 --> 00:49:06,114
(Congratulations. You're the winner.)

1416
00:49:06,115 --> 00:49:07,415
- What does it say?
- You won.

1417
00:49:07,985 --> 00:49:09,854
Joon, you won.

1418
00:49:09,855 --> 00:49:12,384
(Joon will be on a 3-day trip.)

1419
00:49:12,385 --> 00:49:14,125
- Is that it?
- Yes, that's it.

1420
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,025
Look at the cruise ship. Hello.

1421
00:49:17,325 --> 00:49:18,554
I'm the winner.

1422
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:20,264
I won a ticket for the cruise.

1423
00:49:20,265 --> 00:49:21,365
Hello.

1424
00:49:22,165 --> 00:49:24,595
At first, I had some doubts...

1425
00:49:25,165 --> 00:49:26,635
because I've always been fooled.

1426
00:49:26,905 --> 00:49:29,174
But my doubts turned into joy...

1427
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,535
as soon as I saw this cruise ship.

1428
00:49:30,705 --> 00:49:31,775
It looks fabulous.

1429
00:49:32,175 --> 00:49:34,905
It's marvelous. I've never been on such a large ship like this.

1430
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:36,685
It's as big as the Titanic ship.

1431
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:39,595
(By the special trip, did he mean they'd be going on a cruise?)

1432
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:41,885
Am I the only one here?

1433
00:49:42,785 --> 00:49:44,485
Don't you know who is the other member?

1434
00:49:45,255 --> 00:49:46,255
The member who will be going with you.

1435
00:49:46,256 --> 00:49:47,525
No, they didn't tell me.

1436
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:49,855
But I can tell. Wait.

1437
00:49:49,995 --> 00:49:51,455
I can tell from their vans.

1438
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,825
Oh, come on.

1439
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,365
Gosh, it's a celebrity.

1440
00:49:59,135 --> 00:50:04,335
(The second one is Se Yoon.)

1441
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,105
(Feeling frustrated)

1442
00:50:07,645 --> 00:50:12,014
(Congratulations, Se Yoon is selected.)

1443
00:50:12,015 --> 00:50:16,015
(This can't be happening.)

1444
00:50:16,215 --> 00:50:17,885
What is this? Is this an event?

1445
00:50:17,955 --> 00:50:19,524
I heard that it was something nice.

1446
00:50:19,525 --> 00:50:20,525
Right.

1447
00:50:20,755 --> 00:50:21,925
I'm sure you know it by now.

1448
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:23,955
- I still have no idea.
- What's this?

1449
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:26,724
Is this even good? We have no idea at all.

1450
00:50:26,725 --> 00:50:28,295
Today, you're going...

1451
00:50:28,365 --> 00:50:30,864
to the place known as Korea's paradise.

1452
00:50:30,865 --> 00:50:32,764
A beautiful island that holds the ancient beauty of nature,

1453
00:50:32,765 --> 00:50:33,805
Ulleung Island.

1454
00:50:35,905 --> 00:50:38,605
(Ulleung Island)

1455
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,674
This is so iffy. It was nice to be here at first...

1456
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:43,944
- Have you ever been to the island?
- No, I haven't.

1457
00:50:43,945 --> 00:50:45,265
Ulleung Island is very beautiful.

1458
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:47,061
It's your 1st time visiting there. This is my 2nd time.

1459
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:50,684
- Really?
- In the winter of 2022...

1460
00:50:50,685 --> 00:50:53,245
I was forced to visit Ulleung Island from a restaurant in Busan.

1461
00:50:53,285 --> 00:50:56,754
Se Yoon and Joon picked the lucky numbers.

1462
00:50:56,755 --> 00:50:59,264
You'll be heading to Ulleung Island on this luxurious ship.

1463
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,765
- Are we the lucky ones?
- Goodness.

1464
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:02,794
The way to get to the island is kind of depressing. However,

1465
00:51:02,795 --> 00:51:04,194
- it's so nice once you're there.
- Really?

1466
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:05,915
And you will get down once you're adjusted.

1467
00:51:06,535 --> 00:51:08,934
There are many nice things to see and eat.

1468
00:51:08,935 --> 00:51:11,004
- Really?
- And you get all impressed.

1469
00:51:11,005 --> 00:51:12,035
Then they will call you.

1470
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:14,845
"Our cruise is reaching Ulleung Island shortly."

1471
00:51:15,545 --> 00:51:17,465
You have to get down once you start to enjoy it.

1472
00:51:17,515 --> 00:51:18,835
- I can't sleep?
- No, you can't.

1473
00:51:19,115 --> 00:51:20,615
- What time is it?
- We can't sleep.

1474
00:51:20,715 --> 00:51:22,454
We're shooting the opening scene without sleeping?

1475
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:23,584
What's your purpose behind this?

1476
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:25,861
Why do the two of us have to get there before anyone else?

1477
00:51:25,885 --> 00:51:27,984
We wanted to make it more special for you two.

1478
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:30,395
- You did?
- It isn't special. We can't sleep!

1479
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:31,724
We can't sleep?

1480
00:51:31,725 --> 00:51:34,024
Se Yoon, you know it very well. It's Joon's first cruise trip.

1481
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:35,424
- Please take good care of him.
- Sure.

1482
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,764
Let's get on board.

1483
00:51:36,765 --> 00:51:38,494
- Can we get on board now?
- Yes, let's get on board.

1484
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:39,634
- Really?
- Yes.

1485
00:51:39,635 --> 00:51:42,574
(Se Yoon and Joon's special cruise trip starts now.)

1486
00:51:42,575 --> 00:51:44,111
I can't believe I'm on this ship again.

1487
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:45,474
It's like the Titanic.

1488
00:51:45,475 --> 00:51:46,974
(Joon finds it amusing as it's his first time.)

1489
00:51:46,975 --> 00:51:48,005
Don't be surprised.

1490
00:51:51,315 --> 00:51:53,245
(Finally, they're on board.)

1491
00:51:53,445 --> 00:51:55,084
(Impressed)

1492
00:51:55,085 --> 00:51:56,755
Hello. Goodness, is this a ship?

1493
00:51:57,955 --> 00:52:00,524
Now that I'm on board, I find it amazing.

1494
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:02,594
- This doesn't feel like a ship.
- We're on the eighth floor.

1495
00:52:02,595 --> 00:52:03,831
It doesn't feel like that at all.

1496
00:52:03,855 --> 00:52:06,324
- Gosh, it's a claw machine.
- It smells nice, what is this?

1497
00:52:06,325 --> 00:52:07,564
- Tekken.
- What?

1498
00:52:07,565 --> 00:52:08,664
Oh, look at this. Goodness.

1499
00:52:08,665 --> 00:52:09,934
(The arcade on the ship is full of game machines.)

1500
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:11,065
Goodness.

1501
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:12,665
I want to be on this ship.

1502
00:52:13,805 --> 00:52:14,834
(On their way to their rooms)

1503
00:52:14,835 --> 00:52:16,675
So this is how it's like here.

1504
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:19,645
I think this room must have a nice view.

1505
00:52:19,905 --> 00:52:22,075
Let's get in. Goodness.

1506
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:24,245
- This is awesome.
- Oh, my!

1507
00:52:26,245 --> 00:52:27,284
- Okay.
- Goodness.

1508
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:28,784
(An extensive living room)

1509
00:52:28,785 --> 00:52:30,485
- All right.
- Goodness.

1510
00:52:30,555 --> 00:52:33,155
(A cozy bed in the room)

1511
00:52:33,385 --> 00:52:34,524
This is the bathroom.

1512
00:52:34,525 --> 00:52:35,994
(Joon can't stop getting impressed at the site.)

1513
00:52:35,995 --> 00:52:37,095
This is connected here.

1514
00:52:37,255 --> 00:52:39,765
This is incredible!

1515
00:52:41,595 --> 00:52:43,764
(Gosh, the lights get turned off well too.)

1516
00:52:43,765 --> 00:52:45,364
- It's time to kiss.
- Gosh, time to kiss.

1517
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:47,035
(Even a pointless kiss time is possible.)

1518
00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:48,865
It's superb.

1519
00:52:50,035 --> 00:52:51,411
(Taking a tour of the room is only the start.)

1520
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:53,145
(Besides an arcade they saw earlier...)

1521
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:55,344
(They also have a cafe with the ocean view.)

1522
00:52:55,345 --> 00:52:57,175
(A coin karaoke)

1523
00:52:57,245 --> 00:52:59,015
(A performance hall and a restaurant)

1524
00:52:59,515 --> 00:53:01,585
(You can also enjoy the live guitar performance.)

1525
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:06,385
(You can also enjoy the cruise vibe at the bar on the ship.)

1526
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:11,324
(They also prepared for a laser show.)

1527
00:53:11,325 --> 00:53:13,925
So our show...

1528
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:17,594
The purpose of the show is to travel...

1529
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:18,595
Right, you're on a trip for real.

1530
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:20,634
- This is what's happening, yes?
- That's right.

1531
00:53:20,635 --> 00:53:21,804
So I'm selected for that.

1532
00:53:21,805 --> 00:53:23,105
But since we are here...

1533
00:53:23,275 --> 00:53:25,374
before the others, shouldn't we enjoy it?

1534
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,204
- We should chill and relax.
- We're the winners.

1535
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:28,744
Let's do something and eat...

1536
00:53:28,745 --> 00:53:29,774
Please treat us like the winners.

1537
00:53:29,775 --> 00:53:32,375
- You must need some money then.
- You're giving us money?

1538
00:53:33,045 --> 00:53:34,884
- Give us money.
- We can give you.

1539
00:53:34,885 --> 00:53:38,585
But you have to play against us.

1540
00:53:39,385 --> 00:53:41,155
If you win, you'll have the money.

1541
00:53:41,325 --> 00:53:42,555
- How much?
- I get it.

1542
00:53:42,695 --> 00:53:43,794
- How much?
- It's all right.

1543
00:53:43,795 --> 00:53:45,394
- How much do you need?
- I saw the food outside...

1544
00:53:45,395 --> 00:53:46,964
They have jokbal and fried chicken too.

1545
00:53:46,965 --> 00:53:48,565
You can check the prices here.

1546
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:49,994
The price?

1547
00:53:49,995 --> 00:53:52,394
They have everything. Jokbal is 35 dollars.

1548
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,005
Boneless chicken is 25 dollars.

1549
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:56,705
Just pick one thing you want to eat.

1550
00:53:57,075 --> 00:53:58,175
- Honestly?
- Yes.

1551
00:53:58,605 --> 00:53:59,805
I want dried pollack and beer.

1552
00:54:01,545 --> 00:54:02,675
Dried pollack?

1553
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,115
Dried pollack?

1554
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:07,245
- What's wrong?
- Did I hear it right?

1555
00:54:08,185 --> 00:54:10,185
- You all heard it? Dried pollack?
- What's wrong?

1556
00:54:10,315 --> 00:54:12,314
You have other options like jokbal, boneless chicken,

1557
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:14,284
whelk salad with green onions, suyuk, fish cake soup,

1558
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:15,994
pork cutlet, squid sashimi, seasoned squid,

1559
00:54:15,995 --> 00:54:17,224
sliced pork, jokbal with seasoned squid,

1560
00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:18,925
and lastly dried pollack.

1561
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,241
Dried pollack is listed as the last thing.

1562
00:54:21,265 --> 00:54:23,734
People would eat it when they're full after having all these.

1563
00:54:23,735 --> 00:54:25,335
You want to have dried pollack now?

1564
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,575
- You picked it as the first thing.
- I mean...

1565
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:29,375
I'll pick a heavy one then.

1566
00:54:30,975 --> 00:54:33,105
Let's have fried chicken and a can of beer.

1567
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,305
Let's be real.

1568
00:54:34,645 --> 00:54:35,845
Boneless chicken.

1569
00:54:35,975 --> 00:54:37,374
- What kind of game are we playing?
- Per each round,

1570
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,174
- you can bet for 30 dollars.
- Okay.

1571
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:40,614
Let's play three rounds of games.

1572
00:54:40,615 --> 00:54:43,115
Okay. We can win two rounds.

1573
00:54:43,355 --> 00:54:45,084
Let's move over there, it has more space.

1574
00:54:45,085 --> 00:54:46,185
Okay.

1575
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:49,085
Let's play the games then.

1576
00:54:49,395 --> 00:54:50,595
This is the first round.

1577
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:53,464
We'll play the ones you two suggest.

1578
00:54:53,465 --> 00:54:54,624
This is the first round.

1579
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,625
Push-up.

1580
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:56,965
Push-up.

1581
00:54:57,435 --> 00:54:58,565
That sounds fun.

1582
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:00,234
How many can you do?

1583
00:55:00,235 --> 00:55:01,355
I can do about 250 push-ups.

1584
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,535
(Showing confidence)

1585
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,645
Can I take a nap while you do that?

1586
00:55:07,545 --> 00:55:08,604
(He will fall asleep watching 250 push-ups.)

1587
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,275
- You can do about 240 push-ups?
- Sure.

1588
00:55:10,615 --> 00:55:12,274
I can do squats.

1589
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:13,784
- Anything using my body.
- Fitness games?

1590
00:55:13,785 --> 00:55:15,184
- Not something...
- Can you pull up on the chair?

1591
00:55:15,185 --> 00:55:16,815
- Can you pull up?
- Of course.

1592
00:55:16,915 --> 00:55:18,291
How about pulling up on the chair? Whoever lasts longer wins.

1593
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,724
- Only using your arm strength.
- That's right.

1594
00:55:19,725 --> 00:55:21,854
- Can you do it?
- Let's do something like this.

1595
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,855
(Kindly demonstrating)

1596
00:55:22,856 --> 00:55:24,254
You pull up on the chair like this.

1597
00:55:24,255 --> 00:55:26,665
That's great. Don't do it now. Get down.

1598
00:55:26,695 --> 00:55:27,824
- Can you do this?
- Okay.

1599
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,465
- Let's do this.
- Can you?

1600
00:55:30,235 --> 00:55:31,335
If I lose here,

1601
00:55:31,465 --> 00:55:33,005
I shouldn't be working out anymore.

1602
00:55:33,405 --> 00:55:36,204
Honestly, there won't be a reason for me to be alive.

1603
00:55:36,205 --> 00:55:37,874
- We can start the game then.
- I mean this...

1604
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,344
He does marathons too.

1605
00:55:39,345 --> 00:55:40,804
For your information,

1606
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:42,645
he's working on a full marathon.

1607
00:55:43,145 --> 00:55:45,174
You use your lower body for a marathon.

1608
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,444
But this one, you use your upper body.

1609
00:55:46,445 --> 00:55:48,115
I'm good at using my upper body.

1610
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:50,554
I have worked out a lot.

1611
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,754
Let's play it fair and square.

1612
00:55:52,755 --> 00:55:54,224
Don't let your thighs touch this.

1613
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,254
Let's start.

1614
00:55:55,255 --> 00:55:56,694
You should start, I can't see them from here.

1615
00:55:56,695 --> 00:55:59,995
Pulling up on the chair. Let's get ready and start.

1616
00:56:00,765 --> 00:56:03,364
Imagine there are ten spiky chestnuts under your bottoms now.

1617
00:56:03,365 --> 00:56:04,394
Don't go down.

1618
00:56:04,395 --> 00:56:05,564
You have to straighten your arms.

1619
00:56:05,565 --> 00:56:07,565
Okay, that's great.

1620
00:56:08,135 --> 00:56:09,234
(Pull-ups on the chair isn't as easy as he thought.)

1621
00:56:09,235 --> 00:56:10,434
This is...

1622
00:56:10,435 --> 00:56:12,674
- Hold on.
- Don't laugh.

1623
00:56:12,675 --> 00:56:14,175
Just imagine...

1624
00:56:14,645 --> 00:56:17,144
there are sharp nails right below your bottoms.

1625
00:56:17,145 --> 00:56:19,844
Imagine the nails, just hold on to it for a bit.

1626
00:56:19,845 --> 00:56:21,384
Why are you laughing? Hold on.

1627
00:56:21,385 --> 00:56:22,854
- I wasn't making you laugh.
- Don't laugh.

1628
00:56:22,855 --> 00:56:24,914
- Who's laughing? Stop.
- Your legs are touching.

1629
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:26,684
Don't laugh, move forward.

1630
00:56:26,685 --> 00:56:28,354
Move forward.

1631
00:56:28,355 --> 00:56:30,224
It's okay, Joon. Spread your legs.

1632
00:56:30,225 --> 00:56:31,294
All right, we're almost there.

1633
00:56:31,295 --> 00:56:32,324
(It has been 1 minute already.)

1634
00:56:32,325 --> 00:56:34,325
(Coaching Joon)

1635
00:56:34,495 --> 00:56:35,724
- All right.
- My hands are feeling slippery.

1636
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,065
Then slip away!

1637
00:56:37,665 --> 00:56:39,225
You can slip away if it feels slippery.

1638
00:56:39,765 --> 00:56:42,264
Okay, you go ahead.

1639
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:42,912
You can get down.

1640
00:56:43,106 --> 00:56:44,106
Then slip away!

1641
00:56:44,185 --> 00:56:45,745
You can slip away if it feels slippery.

1642
00:56:46,355 --> 00:56:48,724
Okay, you go ahead.

1643
00:56:48,725 --> 00:56:50,295
You can get down.

1644
00:56:50,455 --> 00:56:53,624
- Okay!
- We won.

1645
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:54,965
He's good at this.

1646
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,464
- It was tough for me.
- Don't give excuses.

1647
00:56:57,465 --> 00:56:58,934
It was tougher than I thought.

1648
00:56:58,935 --> 00:57:00,664
Was it tough? It shouldn't be.

1649
00:57:00,665 --> 00:57:02,034
It's tougher than you think.

1650
00:57:02,035 --> 00:57:03,334
It's so tough, isn't it?

1651
00:57:03,335 --> 00:57:04,475
(Se Yoon giving it a try)

1652
00:57:04,575 --> 00:57:07,274
(It ends in 3 seconds.)

1653
00:57:07,275 --> 00:57:09,044
It's much tougher than you think.

1654
00:57:09,045 --> 00:57:10,175
I was surprised.

1655
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:12,944
- We played your game.
- Right.

1656
00:57:12,945 --> 00:57:14,144
We'll play our game this time.

1657
00:57:14,145 --> 00:57:15,684
How about a thigh wrestle?

1658
00:57:15,685 --> 00:57:17,015
Joon Woo will have a go.

1659
00:57:17,185 --> 00:57:19,824
- Hold on. Look at his thighs.
- No, this can't work.

1660
00:57:19,825 --> 00:57:21,084
Are you kidding me?

1661
00:57:21,085 --> 00:57:22,124
He's heavier than me.

1662
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:23,894
Look at his thighs.

1663
00:57:23,895 --> 00:57:26,125
Look at his thighs. How can I beat him?

1664
00:57:26,165 --> 00:57:28,095
- May I tough your thighs?
- Hold on.

1665
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,495
Don't go soft. Stay firm.

1666
00:57:30,895 --> 00:57:32,135
Don't go soft on your thighs.

1667
00:57:32,235 --> 00:57:34,364
I guess it will be a tough match.

1668
00:57:34,365 --> 00:57:35,674
You both are muscular.

1669
00:57:35,675 --> 00:57:36,675
But this...

1670
00:57:37,035 --> 00:57:40,074
I worked hard to make my body this way.

1671
00:57:40,075 --> 00:57:41,075
But he's just naturally fit.

1672
00:57:41,076 --> 00:57:42,615
He must have worked out a lot.

1673
00:57:43,115 --> 00:57:45,314
- Who's going first?
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1674
00:57:45,315 --> 00:57:46,585
Okay. Which one is better?

1675
00:57:46,785 --> 00:57:47,845
- Honestly?
- Yes.

1676
00:57:48,915 --> 00:57:50,014
You have to spread your legs.

1677
00:57:50,015 --> 00:57:51,254
- I'll spread mine first.
- All right.

1678
00:57:51,255 --> 00:57:52,824
Please introduce the player.

1679
00:57:52,825 --> 00:57:53,854
Go ahead.

1680
00:57:53,855 --> 00:57:55,624
I'm Director Lee Joon Woo.

1681
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:56,865
- Director Lee Joon Woo?
- Yes.

1682
00:57:56,955 --> 00:57:58,694
- May I touch your body?
- Sure.

1683
00:57:58,695 --> 00:57:59,795
Gosh, his body is...

1684
00:58:00,225 --> 00:58:01,364
(Checking his thighs and his chest now)

1685
00:58:01,365 --> 00:58:02,765
Look at his chest, feel it.

1686
00:58:03,735 --> 00:58:04,735
Gosh, this is...

1687
00:58:04,736 --> 00:58:06,234
(Joon touching Joon Woo's chest)

1688
00:58:06,235 --> 00:58:07,365
These are his real chests.

1689
00:58:08,805 --> 00:58:11,234
- You made these up.
- Right.

1690
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:12,705
Let's start, ready?

1691
00:58:13,705 --> 00:58:14,744
Start.

1692
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:15,945
(The second game has started.)

1693
00:58:15,975 --> 00:58:18,315
(Joon has to spread Joon Woo's legs for him to win.)

1694
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:19,914
You got it, Joon.

1695
00:58:19,915 --> 00:58:20,984
- How long do we have to play?
- Go!

1696
00:58:20,985 --> 00:58:22,555
Spread his legs!

1697
00:58:22,815 --> 00:58:25,354
- How long?
- Hold on to it...

1698
00:58:25,355 --> 00:58:27,054
Five, four...

1699
00:58:27,055 --> 00:58:29,754
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

1700
00:58:29,755 --> 00:58:32,224
(Joon trying his best to win)

1701
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:34,865
(Using his fully charged thighs and forearms)

1702
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:36,334
- Done.
- They haven't touched.

1703
00:58:36,335 --> 00:58:37,394
You lost.

1704
00:58:37,395 --> 00:58:38,904
Why? They didn't touch.

1705
00:58:38,905 --> 00:58:41,504
This was the thickness and your legs were closer.

1706
00:58:41,505 --> 00:58:42,634
Do it one more time. Okay?

1707
00:58:42,635 --> 00:58:44,005
(Feeling sad)

1708
00:58:44,205 --> 00:58:45,245
Get it together!

1709
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,575
What are you doing?

1710
00:58:46,945 --> 00:58:48,114
Get it together!

1711
00:58:48,115 --> 00:58:49,914
I thought I won.

1712
00:58:49,915 --> 00:58:50,915
You can't beat him with the lower body.

1713
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:52,444
I train my legs really hard.

1714
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:53,914
We aimed to win two rounds.

1715
00:58:53,915 --> 00:58:54,954
It's okay.

1716
00:58:54,955 --> 00:58:55,955
The last game.

1717
00:58:55,956 --> 00:58:57,455
Let me also play. What is it?

1718
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,084
Using this. Okay.

1719
00:58:59,085 --> 00:59:00,155
(A toilet paper roll)

1720
00:59:00,255 --> 00:59:01,324
I'll do it.

1721
00:59:01,325 --> 00:59:02,971
Really? It's really far. Would it be okay?

1722
00:59:02,995 --> 00:59:05,264
Let's throw three times and see who is the closest.

1723
00:59:05,265 --> 00:59:06,694
- What do you think?
- That would be good.

1724
00:59:06,695 --> 00:59:08,594
This ends when one goes in, right?

1725
00:59:08,595 --> 00:59:09,795
Yes. It ends once it enters.

1726
00:59:10,235 --> 00:59:11,595
- Don't give it your best.
- Okay.

1727
00:59:12,565 --> 00:59:13,935
Okay!

1728
00:59:14,035 --> 00:59:15,175
Wouldn't it get pushed?

1729
00:59:15,605 --> 00:59:16,605
It's too far.

1730
00:59:16,606 --> 00:59:18,074
- I'll hold it.
- Is it far?

1731
00:59:18,075 --> 00:59:19,105
I'll hold it.

1732
00:59:19,205 --> 00:59:20,205
Okay!

1733
00:59:20,205 --> 00:59:21,205
(Se Yoon also fails.)

1734
00:59:21,545 --> 00:59:23,374
Okay. Hold on.

1735
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:24,844
- Watch your feet.
- Okay. Here.

1736
00:59:24,845 --> 00:59:26,845
(They're very sensitive since it's the last game.)

1737
00:59:27,385 --> 00:59:28,415
Okay.

1738
00:59:28,685 --> 00:59:29,784
(The toothbrush bounced away.)

1739
00:59:29,785 --> 00:59:31,155
That was a miss.

1740
00:59:32,385 --> 00:59:33,655
Okay! That was close.

1741
00:59:33,855 --> 00:59:35,055
You're too close.

1742
00:59:35,095 --> 00:59:36,095
This...

1743
00:59:36,096 --> 00:59:38,864
(They keep failing.)

1744
00:59:38,865 --> 00:59:40,665
I think we're going to do this for two hours.

1745
00:59:41,325 --> 00:59:43,445
(The toilet paper hole is smaller than they thought.)

1746
00:59:44,295 --> 00:59:45,865
It doesn't...

1747
00:59:46,605 --> 00:59:48,034
(He even hits Joon's hand.)

1748
00:59:48,035 --> 00:59:50,475
It's not even going near it.

1749
00:59:50,605 --> 00:59:52,075
Who invented this game?

1750
00:59:52,475 --> 00:59:53,505
(Shouting)

1751
00:59:53,675 --> 00:59:56,275
- I'm sorry.
- What is this?

1752
00:59:56,475 --> 00:59:57,645
Do it properly.

1753
00:59:58,685 --> 01:00:00,084
Good.

1754
01:00:00,085 --> 01:00:01,405
We haven't gotten the hang of it.

1755
01:00:01,555 --> 01:00:03,475
- We haven't gotten the hang of it.
- It's hard.

1756
01:00:03,655 --> 01:00:05,285
Okay!

1757
01:00:05,725 --> 01:00:07,285
(The toothbrush went inside!)

1758
01:00:07,385 --> 01:00:09,955
(Se Yoon wins!)

1759
01:00:10,195 --> 01:00:11,625
- Yes!
- This is amazing.

1760
01:00:11,765 --> 01:00:13,795
- It ended so quickly.
- Okay.

1761
01:00:13,865 --> 01:00:16,264
We'll give you the allowance money of 60 dollars as promised.

1762
01:00:16,265 --> 01:00:17,395
Thank you.

1763
01:00:17,465 --> 01:00:19,434
We can eat dried pollack and chicken.

1764
01:00:19,435 --> 01:00:20,535
- Amazing!
- We did it.

1765
01:00:20,935 --> 01:00:21,974
- Amazing!
- Thank you.

1766
01:00:21,975 --> 01:00:23,074
(They move from the 8th-floor room to the 5th-floor restaurant area.)

1767
01:00:23,075 --> 01:00:24,105
This is amazing.

1768
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:28,074
(They head to the bar on the ship with their allowance.)

1769
01:00:28,075 --> 01:00:29,075
Hey.

1770
01:00:29,345 --> 01:00:30,414
There are too many people now.

1771
01:00:30,415 --> 01:00:32,644
Hey.

1772
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:34,645
- It's crazy.
- It feels like Southeast Asia.

1773
01:00:36,015 --> 01:00:37,685
(It's packed with people.)

1774
01:00:37,755 --> 01:00:40,255
(Joon starts moving in excitement.)

1775
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:43,595
I don't think I can do it because I'm shy. You're good.

1776
01:00:43,755 --> 01:00:44,864
Let's go.

1777
01:00:44,865 --> 01:00:47,365
(The customers in the bar react to Joon's dancing.)

1778
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:48,764
(Se Yoon is an extreme introvert.)

1779
01:00:48,765 --> 01:00:50,365
Nice to meet you!

1780
01:00:50,835 --> 01:00:51,835
Thank you.

1781
01:00:51,836 --> 01:00:54,005
Five!

1782
01:00:54,135 --> 01:00:55,505
He's crazy. What's wrong with him?

1783
01:00:55,835 --> 01:00:57,305
Are you mad? What are you doing?

1784
01:00:57,805 --> 01:00:59,245
- It feels good.
- There...

1785
01:01:00,045 --> 01:01:01,544
Can we get one fried chicken...

1786
01:01:01,545 --> 01:01:03,621
and dried pollack to go? I don't think we can eat them here.

1787
01:01:03,645 --> 01:01:04,914
- Can we get those to go?
- Yes, you can.

1788
01:01:04,915 --> 01:01:06,144
- Please make those.
- Okay.

1789
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:07,944
- It's a 2 Days 1 Night order.
- All right.

1790
01:01:07,945 --> 01:01:10,255
Thank you.

1791
01:01:10,515 --> 01:01:12,525
He's gone mad. What is he doing?

1792
01:01:14,325 --> 01:01:16,395
(The two men with contrasting vibes)

1793
01:01:17,195 --> 01:01:18,695
You look handsome.

1794
01:01:18,865 --> 01:01:20,064
What are you doing? Are you mad?

1795
01:01:20,065 --> 01:01:21,934
(Joon's dance instinct doesn't cool easily.)

1796
01:01:21,935 --> 01:01:23,795
Everyone! Yes.

1797
01:01:24,235 --> 01:01:26,464
You're going to Ulleung Island, right?

1798
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:28,065
We're going as well.

1799
01:01:28,405 --> 01:01:29,834
Have a happy evening!

1800
01:01:29,835 --> 01:01:31,804
- Two days...
- One night!

1801
01:01:31,805 --> 01:01:33,474
Thank you! This is nice!

1802
01:01:33,475 --> 01:01:36,945
(Se Yoon is also excited thanks to Joon.)

1803
01:01:37,145 --> 01:01:38,984
This is crazy. The place feels amazing.

1804
01:01:38,985 --> 01:01:40,214
(A crazy party on board)

1805
01:01:40,215 --> 01:01:41,614
- It's crazy.
- It's heated here!

1806
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:43,185
Nice to meet you.

1807
01:01:43,315 --> 01:01:44,585
The air is heated here.

1808
01:01:45,355 --> 01:01:46,685
I can't control my excitement.

1809
01:01:47,455 --> 01:01:49,094
- Shall we go to a coin karaoke?
- You have some money left, right?

1810
01:01:49,095 --> 01:01:50,194
- Let's go to the coin karaoke.
- Let's...

1811
01:01:50,195 --> 01:01:51,295
We have one dollar left.

1812
01:01:51,425 --> 01:01:53,585
I never thought I'd come to the coin karaoke with you.

1813
01:01:54,765 --> 01:01:56,164
We came to a coin karaoke.

1814
01:01:56,165 --> 01:01:57,165
(They enter the karaoke.)

1815
01:01:57,495 --> 01:01:59,664
(What's Joon's favorite song?)

1816
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:00,665
Okay.

1817
01:02:01,365 --> 01:02:02,934
That's right!

1818
01:02:02,935 --> 01:02:04,774
That's right!

1819
01:02:04,775 --> 01:02:06,775
(Joon's first song is "You In My Faded Memories.")

1820
01:02:06,805 --> 01:02:08,074
Lee Joon's time.

1821
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:10,775
(My energy begins now.)

1822
01:02:11,175 --> 01:02:13,984
(The way a former idol has fun in a karaoke)

1823
01:02:13,985 --> 01:02:14,985
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1824
01:02:16,985 --> 01:02:18,985
(The cameraman is taking a rest in the next room.)

1825
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:21,384
(He's Joon's cameraman for today.)

1826
01:02:21,385 --> 01:02:22,894
(Se Yoon's camera)

1827
01:02:22,895 --> 01:02:25,025
(Some fancy camera moves)

1828
01:02:26,995 --> 01:02:29,335
(The milky cigarette smoke)

1829
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:34,634
(And the flashy clothes reflected in the mirror)

1830
01:02:34,635 --> 01:02:35,705
(Hit it!)

1831
01:02:36,405 --> 01:02:39,504
(He moves quite swiftly despite his size.)

1832
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:42,975
(He recalls his idol instinct after 8 years thanks to that.)

1833
01:02:44,475 --> 01:02:45,685
Let's go!

1834
01:02:45,815 --> 01:02:49,614
(Since you turned away)

1835
01:02:49,615 --> 01:02:53,755
(Since you drifted apart)

1836
01:02:53,855 --> 01:02:57,794
(An enthusiastic cameraman...)

1837
01:02:57,795 --> 01:03:00,965
(and an artist who responds back.)

1838
01:03:01,565 --> 01:03:05,765
(Se Yoon and Joon's perfect best friend chemistry)

1839
01:03:05,805 --> 01:03:06,835
(Screaming)

1840
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:11,945
(He leaves the stage because of Joon's eardrum attack.)

1841
01:03:12,045 --> 01:03:13,545
(He focuses on his task again.)

1842
01:03:15,675 --> 01:03:20,115
(His eardrum gets attacked the 2nd time.)

1843
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:22,485
It's so hot.

1844
01:03:23,115 --> 01:03:24,115
Hold on.

1845
01:03:24,116 --> 01:03:25,154
(Joon is drenched in sweat after singing one song.)

1846
01:03:25,155 --> 01:03:26,225
Hold on.

1847
01:03:27,225 --> 01:03:31,665
What's Lee Joon's score?

1848
01:03:32,895 --> 01:03:34,664
- It's really hot.
- You got 100 points!

1849
01:03:34,665 --> 01:03:36,265
(He got 100 points!)

1850
01:03:36,495 --> 01:03:38,304
(He becomes the Hundred Points Man from Zero Point Man.)

1851
01:03:38,305 --> 01:03:40,204
- One hundred points!
- One hundred points.

1852
01:03:40,205 --> 01:03:41,534
- One hundred points!
- One hundred points!

1853
01:03:41,535 --> 01:03:44,205
- Encore.
- Se Yoon.

1854
01:03:44,435 --> 01:03:45,475
You should sing one.

1855
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:47,944
I can't sing anymore. I feel like I'm going to die.

1856
01:03:47,945 --> 01:03:49,915
- I'm so tired.
- Let's just...

1857
01:03:50,515 --> 01:03:52,645
let someone else come and play.

1858
01:03:53,085 --> 01:03:55,355
Let's leave one dollar there.

1859
01:03:55,515 --> 01:03:57,585
We won the trip.

1860
01:03:58,825 --> 01:04:00,185
We should do it since we won this.

1861
01:04:00,225 --> 01:04:01,724
- I'm so tired.
- Where would we get such a chance?

1862
01:04:01,725 --> 01:04:04,395
(Feeling nauseous)

1863
01:04:05,765 --> 01:04:08,435
It's a dollar per song!

1864
01:04:09,165 --> 01:04:12,265
(The second song started because of Joon.)

1865
01:04:12,705 --> 01:04:13,734
That's right!

1866
01:04:13,735 --> 01:04:16,504
(Dancing kings Lee Joon and Se Yoon)

1867
01:04:16,505 --> 01:04:18,275
Go! That's right!

1868
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:22,545
(This is the privilege for the winners.)

1869
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:26,145
I'm so happy!

1870
01:04:26,745 --> 01:04:29,355
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1871
01:04:30,355 --> 01:04:33,924
(Music Bank in Cruise Part Two begins.)

1872
01:04:33,925 --> 01:04:37,425
(Production crew: We'll set up occasions like this more often.)

1873
01:04:37,455 --> 01:04:41,365
(It's old, enough with the nonsense)

1874
01:04:43,165 --> 01:04:44,995
(They can't skip the key choreography.)

1875
01:04:45,905 --> 01:04:49,705
(Stage manners at its peak)

1876
01:04:49,905 --> 01:04:52,805
(Perfect recreation of the 2000s)

1877
01:04:55,115 --> 01:04:57,145
(Joon tries to escape the room.)

1878
01:04:57,345 --> 01:04:58,345
It's so hot.

1879
01:04:58,985 --> 01:05:01,045
(But he's forced back into the room.)

1880
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:04,355
(Giving it his all in the finale)

1881
01:05:06,155 --> 01:05:07,324
Let's go, Joon.

1882
01:05:07,325 --> 01:05:09,095
- I can't do this.
- Go!

1883
01:05:09,525 --> 01:05:11,524
- An amazing voice.
- One hundred points.

1884
01:05:11,525 --> 01:05:12,694
(They score 100 points again!)

1885
01:05:12,695 --> 01:05:13,795
One hundred points.

1886
01:05:14,325 --> 01:05:15,494
Let's eat fried chicken.

1887
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:17,364
Let's chew the dried pollack on our way so we aren't bored.

1888
01:05:17,365 --> 01:05:18,704
Okay.

1889
01:05:18,705 --> 01:05:21,435
(They return to their room with the night snacks.)

1890
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:23,405
We can get takeout food.

1891
01:05:23,905 --> 01:05:25,904
- Right.
- We can get takeout food.

1892
01:05:25,905 --> 01:05:28,415
It's an unusual thing to drink Coke...

1893
01:05:28,515 --> 01:05:30,645
- on 2 Days 1 Night.
- This isn't 2 Days 1 Night.

1894
01:05:31,045 --> 01:05:32,885
- What is this?
- This is a special episode.

1895
01:05:33,215 --> 01:05:35,014
- Of course.
- A spin-off?

1896
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:37,385
- It's a spin-off.
- Come to think of it,

1897
01:05:37,415 --> 01:05:39,375
we haven't even begun filming 2 Days 1 Night yet.

1898
01:05:39,425 --> 01:05:41,455
(Reality hits him.)

1899
01:05:41,555 --> 01:05:42,825
We haven't departed yet?

1900
01:05:42,955 --> 01:05:44,525
It hasn't departed yet.

1901
01:05:44,725 --> 01:05:46,724
It didn't. What is this?

1902
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:48,025
I had so much fun.

1903
01:05:48,325 --> 01:05:50,264
(It didn't depart yet?)

1904
01:05:50,265 --> 01:05:52,785
It's been docked for too long Wouldn't it get a parking ticket?

1905
01:05:53,305 --> 01:05:55,374
I think we should move quickly.

1906
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:56,851
(He's worried the ship would get towed away.)

1907
01:05:56,875 --> 01:05:59,375
What's going on? Why isn't it departing?

1908
01:05:59,605 --> 01:06:01,845
I'm curious how many minutes will be used from this.

1909
01:06:02,275 --> 01:06:04,715
It will be aired for quite a bit. Around four minutes.

1910
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:07,515
(Don't worry. A lot of it is being used.)

1911
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:09,885
Please tell us our schedule for tomorrow briefly.

1912
01:06:09,985 --> 01:06:11,984
- I'll tell you.
- What? Really?

1913
01:06:11,985 --> 01:06:12,985
What will we do tomorrow?

1914
01:06:12,986 --> 01:06:14,854
Tomorrow morning, you'll welcome the members...

1915
01:06:14,855 --> 01:06:16,095
at the port.

1916
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:18,665
What?

1917
01:06:19,295 --> 01:06:21,095
- And?
- You'll eat before that.

1918
01:06:21,295 --> 01:06:22,711
You'll welcome the members after eating.

1919
01:06:22,735 --> 01:06:24,594
- Really?
- That's all for the morning.

1920
01:06:24,595 --> 01:06:26,005
Even I could guess...

1921
01:06:26,205 --> 01:06:27,604
that much.

1922
01:06:27,605 --> 01:06:29,281
(Even I would know that even if you didn't tell me.)

1923
01:06:29,305 --> 01:06:31,225
You don't know what we're doing tomorrow, right?

1924
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:33,905
You don't know it either, right?

1925
01:06:34,205 --> 01:06:35,545
He doesn't know it either.

1926
01:06:35,615 --> 01:06:38,121
They wouldn't just leave us when we came all the way to Ulleung Island.

1927
01:06:38,145 --> 01:06:39,921
They'd make us work without letting us sleep.

1928
01:06:39,945 --> 01:06:41,745
That's why we're doing this here.

1929
01:06:41,985 --> 01:06:43,685
I think this Ulleung Island trip...

1930
01:06:44,255 --> 01:06:45,685
isn't going to be easy.

1931
01:06:46,825 --> 01:06:50,494
(The road of suffering lies plainly before them.)

1932
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,595
I'm tired.

1933
01:06:52,195 --> 01:06:54,595
(It's affecting him mentally as well.)

1934
01:06:55,165 --> 01:06:59,705
(How is Joon's first Ulleung Island trip going be?)

1935
01:07:00,935 --> 01:07:02,075
The engine started.

1936
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,835
The engine finally started.

1937
01:07:03,975 --> 01:07:05,975
- It's moving.
- It's moving.

1938
01:07:06,675 --> 01:07:08,744
It's moving now.

1939
01:07:08,745 --> 01:07:09,745
Yes.

1940
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:13,585
(He squeezes out more screen time using his ship-horn act.)

1941
01:07:14,045 --> 01:07:15,185
Seagull.

1942
01:07:15,415 --> 01:07:16,415
(Caw)

1943
01:07:18,185 --> 01:07:19,255
(Caw)

1944
01:07:19,325 --> 01:07:21,125
(Caw)

1945
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:24,625
We're heading to Ulleung Island now.

1946
01:07:26,825 --> 01:07:29,034
We're on a cruise ship today.

1947
01:07:29,035 --> 01:07:30,075
(They get ready to sleep.)

1948
01:07:30,135 --> 01:07:32,865
It's nice to sleep on a bed without playing games.

1949
01:07:33,205 --> 01:07:35,575
Goodnight. We have to get up soon.

1950
01:07:35,775 --> 01:07:37,804
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1951
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:39,565
(They head to dreamland to get up tomorrow.)

1952
01:07:40,205 --> 01:07:44,075
(The night in East Sea grows deeper.)

1953
01:07:44,715 --> 01:07:49,215
(The ship goes through the darkness toward Ulleung Island.)

1954
01:07:49,585 --> 01:07:55,525
(The ship steadily moves and morning is already here.)

1955
01:07:57,255 --> 01:07:59,525
(Meanwhile, the sun rises on the land as well.)

1956
01:08:00,065 --> 01:08:03,795
(The day of the real shooting, 7am)

1957
01:08:04,765 --> 01:08:08,505
(Mukho Port, Donghae)

1958
01:08:08,875 --> 01:08:11,075
- Did you get some sleep?
- Hello. Yes, I slept.

1959
01:08:11,235 --> 01:08:12,505
Hello.

1960
01:08:12,645 --> 01:08:14,605
(Sae Ho is the 1st to arrive.)

1961
01:08:15,545 --> 01:08:17,115
You brought a large suitcase.

1962
01:08:17,175 --> 01:08:18,885
I was told to pack a large suitcase.

1963
01:08:19,045 --> 01:08:20,045
Is that so?

1964
01:08:20,046 --> 01:08:21,084
(The suitcase is as long as his lower body.)

1965
01:08:21,085 --> 01:08:22,285
I was very shocked.

1966
01:08:22,585 --> 01:08:24,154
Did I have to pack so much?

1967
01:08:24,155 --> 01:08:25,484
- We never know.
- Nice to see you.

1968
01:08:25,485 --> 01:08:26,824
(He doesn't know the destination, but he's fully prepared.)

1969
01:08:26,825 --> 01:08:28,595
I wore these glasses...

1970
01:08:28,825 --> 01:08:30,994
because I have a stye in my eye.

1971
01:08:30,995 --> 01:08:32,294
- Please understand.
- All right.

1972
01:08:32,295 --> 01:08:33,595
- You're here.
- You came.

1973
01:08:33,695 --> 01:08:35,564
- Hello.
- Hello.

1974
01:08:35,565 --> 01:08:37,795
Did you lose the draw as well?

1975
01:08:38,935 --> 01:08:40,835
- Yes.
- I sensed it.

1976
01:08:41,065 --> 01:08:42,105
How did you know?

1977
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:43,475
What's going on today?

1978
01:08:43,775 --> 01:08:45,644
- Is it just the two of us?
- I'm not sure.

1979
01:08:45,645 --> 01:08:46,974
- Seon Ho is here.
- What?

1980
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,075
- What?
- Hey, Seon Ho!

1981
01:08:48,305 --> 01:08:50,015
Hello.

1982
01:08:50,075 --> 01:08:51,215
- Seon Ho.
- Yes?

1983
01:08:51,275 --> 01:08:52,684
- Did you win the draw?
- No.

1984
01:08:52,685 --> 01:08:54,215
What's going on?

1985
01:08:54,315 --> 01:08:56,014
- You're here.
- Did you win or not?

1986
01:08:56,015 --> 01:08:57,335
- Sorry?
- Did you lose the draw?

1987
01:08:57,455 --> 01:08:58,654
I lost the draw.

1988
01:08:58,655 --> 01:09:00,284
- He must have lost as well.
- All four of us lost.

1989
01:09:00,285 --> 01:09:01,784
Isn't it bad to lose the draw?

1990
01:09:01,785 --> 01:09:02,871
(The 4 who have lost the draw have gathered feeling puzzled.)

1991
01:09:02,895 --> 01:09:04,395
A few of us aren't here.

1992
01:09:04,595 --> 01:09:06,195
Do the winners get a day off?

1993
01:09:06,565 --> 01:09:09,164
Are we getting new members?

1994
01:09:09,165 --> 01:09:10,264
(Did they have to step down?)

1995
01:09:10,265 --> 01:09:11,764
It said, "Congratulations on winning the draw!"

1996
01:09:11,765 --> 01:09:13,434
Isn't it bad to lose the draw?

1997
01:09:13,435 --> 01:09:14,834
(It's time to tell these members the truth.)

1998
01:09:14,835 --> 01:09:17,074
Before the shoot,

1999
01:09:17,075 --> 01:09:18,234
you all played the ghost leg game, right?

2000
01:09:18,235 --> 01:09:19,944
- Yes.
- The winners...

2001
01:09:19,945 --> 01:09:21,875
are Se Yoon and Joon.

2002
01:09:23,175 --> 01:09:25,245
They are waiting for you on Ulleung Island.

2003
01:09:25,415 --> 01:09:26,415
What?

2004
01:09:26,545 --> 01:09:27,814
They went a day earlier?

2005
01:09:27,815 --> 01:09:29,385
(Shocked)

2006
01:09:29,455 --> 01:09:31,615
- It's a good thing to lose then.
- But...

2007
01:09:31,915 --> 01:09:33,084
- Then...
- Yes?

2008
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:34,425
What time did they get there?

2009
01:09:34,825 --> 01:09:37,194
They gathered at 9pm.

2010
01:09:37,195 --> 01:09:38,865
- At night?
- Yes.

2011
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:40,795
They departed from Pohang.

2012
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:43,594
So they had to go all the way to Pohang.

2013
01:09:43,595 --> 01:09:46,135
Hold on. To get to Pohang by 9pm,

2014
01:09:46,505 --> 01:09:47,634
they must've left Seoul...

2015
01:09:47,635 --> 01:09:50,075
at around 3 or 4pm because of traffic.

2016
01:09:50,275 --> 01:09:51,504
- Right.
- Gosh.

2017
01:09:51,505 --> 01:09:52,904
You might get a punch in the face.

2018
01:09:52,905 --> 01:09:54,044
(You might get a punch when you get to Ulleung Island.)

2019
01:09:54,045 --> 01:09:55,344
Why are you being like that?

2020
01:09:55,345 --> 01:09:56,545
What is all this?

2021
01:09:56,675 --> 01:09:59,615
DinDin wanted this kind of burst of dopamine.

2022
01:10:00,285 --> 01:10:01,984
That was a great burst of dopamine.

2023
01:10:01,985 --> 01:10:04,515
It's the result that matters. We avoided all of that.

2024
01:10:04,685 --> 01:10:06,165
Will we go to Ulleung Island as well?

2025
01:10:06,555 --> 01:10:07,824
- So...
- What's happening?

2026
01:10:07,825 --> 01:10:10,254
As you all have figured it out,

2027
01:10:10,255 --> 01:10:12,565
we will be traveling to Ulleung Island.

2028
01:10:12,995 --> 01:10:14,394
Ulleung Island is a beautiful place.

2029
01:10:14,395 --> 01:10:15,594
It's been such a long time to visit Ulleung Island.

2030
01:10:15,595 --> 01:10:17,534
Has it been three years? You've never been there, right?

2031
01:10:17,535 --> 01:10:19,881
- It's my first time there.
- How long have you been with us?

2032
01:10:19,905 --> 01:10:21,634
It has been over three years.

2033
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:24,175
- Then it has been 4 to 5 years.
- Right.

2034
01:10:24,575 --> 01:10:26,844
- Jong Min went.
- You collected Siberian onions.

2035
01:10:26,845 --> 01:10:28,344
- He went alone.
- Oh, right.

2036
01:10:28,345 --> 01:10:29,345
(He went to collect Siberian onions on his own 3 years ago.)

2037
01:10:29,346 --> 01:10:30,775
It was like going to the army.

2038
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:32,784
It's my first time there as well.

2039
01:10:32,785 --> 01:10:34,385
- It's your first time?
- Yes.

2040
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:35,514
In your life?

2041
01:10:35,515 --> 01:10:37,214
- Yes. I've never been there at all.
- Really?

2042
01:10:37,215 --> 01:10:38,614
- Yes.
- I didn't expect that.

2043
01:10:38,615 --> 01:10:40,384
It's my seventh time visiting Ulleung Island.

2044
01:10:40,385 --> 01:10:41,925
(It's actually his eighth time.)

2045
01:10:41,985 --> 01:10:43,995
You're an expert.

2046
01:10:44,055 --> 01:10:45,764
- I know everything.
- Could you describe...

2047
01:10:45,765 --> 01:10:47,564
Ulleung Island for us?

2048
01:10:47,565 --> 01:10:49,195
- Well, it's an island.
- I see.

2049
01:10:49,865 --> 01:10:52,135
- Our country's beautiful island.
- Right.

2050
01:10:52,265 --> 01:10:53,804
We'll set off now.

2051
01:10:53,805 --> 01:10:55,005
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2052
01:10:56,135 --> 01:10:57,135
Shall we go?

2053
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,744
It's moving now.

2054
01:11:02,745 --> 01:11:03,974
(We are heading to Ulleung Island...)

2055
01:11:03,975 --> 01:11:05,374
(where Se Yoon and Joon are waiting.)

2056
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:07,114
Personally,

2057
01:11:07,115 --> 01:11:08,875
I think Ulleung Island is a beautiful place.

2058
01:11:08,985 --> 01:11:11,554
I'm quite excited after hearing about it from DinDin.

2059
01:11:11,555 --> 01:11:13,324
I've never been to Ulleung Island.

2060
01:11:13,325 --> 01:11:14,424
You must feel excited.

2061
01:11:14,425 --> 01:11:16,054
I'm curious about the place as well.

2062
01:11:16,055 --> 01:11:18,025
It's beautiful with the color of the sea.

2063
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:20,164
It's really beautiful inside the water.

2064
01:11:20,165 --> 01:11:21,245
You should go in the water.

2065
01:11:22,095 --> 01:11:23,264
Just go in?

2066
01:11:23,265 --> 01:11:25,135
Sae Ho and Seon Ho should go in the water.

2067
01:11:25,295 --> 01:11:26,334
In the water.

2068
01:11:26,335 --> 01:11:28,464
I enjoy scuba diving.

2069
01:11:28,465 --> 01:11:29,574
- Really?
- Yes.

2070
01:11:29,575 --> 01:11:30,975
You have to go in without anything.

2071
01:11:31,135 --> 01:11:32,174
How?

2072
01:11:32,175 --> 01:11:34,245
(Dumbfounded)

2073
01:11:34,505 --> 01:11:36,274
The ferry is definitely moving up and down a lot.

2074
01:11:36,275 --> 01:11:37,945
Gosh! It has begun.

2075
01:11:38,445 --> 01:11:39,445
I feel dizzy.

2076
01:11:39,446 --> 01:11:41,244
The waves are quite strong.

2077
01:11:41,245 --> 01:11:43,384
The waves are certainly strong around this area.

2078
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:45,745
- The waves are strong.
- Yes. You can feel it on the ship.

2079
01:11:46,755 --> 01:11:48,424
- I love this feeling.
- Gosh, I feel dizzy.

2080
01:11:48,425 --> 01:11:49,895
- Do you really feel dizzy?
- Yes.

2081
01:11:50,495 --> 01:11:51,824
I think I'm feeling seasick already.

2082
01:11:51,825 --> 01:11:54,565
(Everyone starts feeling seasick.)

2083
01:11:55,735 --> 01:11:57,094
Gosh, the waves are strong.

2084
01:11:57,095 --> 01:11:58,741
(The drone director has already collapsed.)

2085
01:11:58,765 --> 01:12:00,325
Squid must be eaten at times like this.

2086
01:12:00,805 --> 01:12:01,805
It will help with the seasickness.

2087
01:12:01,806 --> 01:12:02,975
- Squid?
- Yes.

2088
01:12:03,305 --> 01:12:05,335
Jong Min said we should have some squid...

2089
01:12:05,435 --> 01:12:07,445
when we feel seasick. What should we do?

2090
01:12:07,975 --> 01:12:09,474
I'm serious.

2091
01:12:09,475 --> 01:12:11,545
That's what people do when going to Ulleng Island.

2092
01:12:12,185 --> 01:12:13,714
There's a store on the ferry.

2093
01:12:13,715 --> 01:12:14,744
- Right.
- Right.

2094
01:12:14,745 --> 01:12:16,314
- There's a store.
- That's awesome.

2095
01:12:16,315 --> 01:12:18,185
I will show you what they have.

2096
01:12:18,415 --> 01:12:20,585
- These are the things they have.
- That's great.

2097
01:12:20,725 --> 01:12:22,871
- They have a lot of things.
- They have a lot of things.

2098
01:12:22,895 --> 01:12:24,254
Those are good.

2099
01:12:24,255 --> 01:12:25,795
These are the things they have.

2100
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:28,494
We must be playing a game for some money.

2101
01:12:28,495 --> 01:12:30,134
- It's been a while.
- I want to have a lot of things.

2102
01:12:30,135 --> 01:12:31,194
Will you buy us everything?

2103
01:12:31,195 --> 01:12:33,064
Should we play a simple game...

2104
01:12:33,065 --> 01:12:34,765
- for some money...
- Okay.

2105
01:12:34,865 --> 01:12:36,204
That can be used at the store?

2106
01:12:36,205 --> 01:12:38,105
- That sounds great.
- Okay.

2107
01:12:38,235 --> 01:12:40,705
The one who answers the most questions...

2108
01:12:40,905 --> 01:12:42,005
will get ten dollars.

2109
01:12:42,845 --> 01:12:44,214
(What game will they play to win money for the snacks?)

2110
01:12:44,215 --> 01:12:45,615
From now on,

2111
01:12:46,345 --> 01:12:47,714
we will ask questions...

2112
01:12:47,715 --> 01:12:50,955
about Se Yoon and Joon who aren't with us right now.

2113
01:12:50,985 --> 01:12:52,525
- Gosh.
- This will be hard.

2114
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,554
Let's start with the first question.

2115
01:12:54,555 --> 01:12:56,055
- Okay.
- The first question.

2116
01:12:56,855 --> 01:12:58,495
Se Yoon and Joon...

2117
01:12:58,825 --> 01:13:00,794
are on a trip for 3 days and 2 nights.

2118
01:13:00,795 --> 01:13:01,824
- Okay.
- Right.

2119
01:13:01,825 --> 01:13:05,164
How many pieces of underwear these two bring in total?

2120
01:13:05,165 --> 01:13:06,605
- DinDin.
- Seon Ho.

2121
01:13:06,935 --> 01:13:07,964
DinDin.

2122
01:13:07,965 --> 01:13:09,105
(Thinking)

2123
01:13:09,675 --> 01:13:10,775
Five.

2124
01:13:10,905 --> 01:13:13,104
- Se Yoon would've brought two.
- Right.

2125
01:13:13,105 --> 01:13:14,421
One prepared for getting in the water.

2126
01:13:14,445 --> 01:13:17,075
- And another spare one.
- Right.

2127
01:13:17,245 --> 01:13:19,584
He would just wear the same one even if he runs out.

2128
01:13:19,585 --> 01:13:21,425
He is someone who can wear the same one again.

2129
01:13:21,845 --> 01:13:23,631
- He doesn't bring a lot.
- That's how Se Yoon is?

2130
01:13:23,655 --> 01:13:25,924
Joon would've thought about getting into the water...

2131
01:13:25,925 --> 01:13:28,155
and would've prepared 3. So 5 in total.

2132
01:13:28,225 --> 01:13:29,454
- DinDin, you are incorrect.
- I'm right.

2133
01:13:29,455 --> 01:13:30,924
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho was first.

2134
01:13:30,925 --> 01:13:31,954
(Seon Ho gets a chance to answer next.)

2135
01:13:31,955 --> 01:13:33,565
- Four.
- Four?

2136
01:13:33,895 --> 01:13:35,995
DinDin has got it all wrong.

2137
01:13:36,835 --> 01:13:39,165
Joon is someone who would wear the same underwear again.

2138
01:13:39,805 --> 01:13:42,325
Joon would never have prepared up to three pieces of underwear.

2139
01:13:42,475 --> 01:13:43,935
I will go with four.

2140
01:13:44,005 --> 01:13:45,451
- Seon Ho, you are incorrect!
- Sae Ho.

2141
01:13:45,475 --> 01:13:46,805
- Sae Ho.
- Three.

2142
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:48,574
- Three. Here's why.
- Okay.

2143
01:13:48,575 --> 01:13:51,814
As I was getting changed with Se Yoon,

2144
01:13:51,815 --> 01:13:55,115
I heard that he always prepared three pieces of underwear.

2145
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:57,454
- Three!
- So Joon didn't bring any?

2146
01:13:57,455 --> 01:13:58,515
He didn't bring any.

2147
01:13:59,025 --> 01:14:01,161
It would be strange to say he didn't bring any underwear,

2148
01:14:01,185 --> 01:14:03,095
so I will say he forgot to.

2149
01:14:03,255 --> 01:14:04,924
- Incorrect!
- Jong Min.

2150
01:14:04,925 --> 01:14:05,965
Is it two then?

2151
01:14:06,265 --> 01:14:07,895
- Two.
- Two?

2152
01:14:09,265 --> 01:14:10,935
Joon isn't wearing any underwear.

2153
01:14:11,495 --> 01:14:13,334
- Gosh.
- Right.

2154
01:14:13,335 --> 01:14:14,881
He is planning to stay without wearing any underwear.

2155
01:14:14,905 --> 01:14:16,575
- Jong Min, incorrect! DinDin.
- DinDin.

2156
01:14:16,675 --> 01:14:17,835
They brought six.

2157
01:14:18,035 --> 01:14:20,274
- They brought six.
- That must be the answer.

2158
01:14:20,275 --> 01:14:21,444
Why did they prepare so many?

2159
01:14:21,445 --> 01:14:22,815
- They aren't like that.
- Right.

2160
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:24,515
DinDin, you are correct.

2161
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:27,115
- They brought 6?
- They prepared 3 each.

2162
01:14:27,215 --> 01:14:29,385
- Really?
- Wasn't it counted incorrectly?

2163
01:14:30,185 --> 01:14:32,555
Did you bring enough underwear?

2164
01:14:32,825 --> 01:14:34,555
- Our underwear?
- Yes.

2165
01:14:35,285 --> 01:14:36,624
- Three?
- Three?

2166
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,585
I think it's three including the one I'm wearing.

2167
01:14:38,855 --> 01:14:41,095
- Why ask about our underwear?
- We were just curious.

2168
01:14:41,165 --> 01:14:42,965
- Just curious?
- This must be for something.

2169
01:14:43,165 --> 01:14:44,664
They prepared three each.

2170
01:14:44,665 --> 01:14:46,635
- Really?
- Wasn't it counted incorrectly?

2171
01:14:46,665 --> 01:14:49,065
Why did Joon bring three? Is he slightly leaking these days?

2172
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:51,234
He was never like that.

2173
01:14:51,235 --> 01:14:52,804
So the first question...

2174
01:14:52,805 --> 01:14:54,375
- was answered by DinDin.
- Okay.

2175
01:14:54,545 --> 01:14:56,975
Actually, Se Yoon and Joon...

2176
01:14:57,645 --> 01:15:00,314
did quite a lot last night.

2177
01:15:00,315 --> 01:15:01,914
- Really?
- What did they do?

2178
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:03,791
- They weren't just there.
- What could they have done?

2179
01:15:03,815 --> 01:15:05,255
The two members...

2180
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,625
went through a night snack mission...

2181
01:15:08,055 --> 01:15:09,955
and bought two dishes of food.

2182
01:15:11,095 --> 01:15:13,724
Out of the following answers, which dishes did they eat?

2183
01:15:13,725 --> 01:15:15,494
- Name two of them.
- Two?

2184
01:15:15,495 --> 01:15:18,095
- Jokbal, boneless fried chicken, - Jokbal?

2185
01:15:18,295 --> 01:15:20,005
- Jokbal?
- whelk salad,

2186
01:15:20,365 --> 01:15:21,535
pork cutlet,

2187
01:15:21,865 --> 01:15:23,875
seafood fishcake soup, and dried pollack.

2188
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:25,745
DinDin.

2189
01:15:26,005 --> 01:15:27,575
- Jokbal and fried chicken.
- Okay.

2190
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:29,614
- That's the safest answer.
- Here's why.

2191
01:15:29,615 --> 01:15:31,174
- Okay.
- They wouldn't have been given...

2192
01:15:31,175 --> 01:15:32,445
all of the food they wanted.

2193
01:15:32,685 --> 01:15:35,021
They would've decided to order the dishes with the most food.

2194
01:15:35,045 --> 01:15:36,115
DinDin, you are incorrect!

2195
01:15:36,655 --> 01:15:37,684
- Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho.

2196
01:15:37,685 --> 01:15:39,325
Boneless fried chicken and dried pollack.

2197
01:15:39,455 --> 01:15:42,084
The staff members might've done a quiz with them...

2198
01:15:42,085 --> 01:15:43,555
and I think they might've won...

2199
01:15:43,895 --> 01:15:46,625
the boneless fried chicken and dried pollack.

2200
01:15:46,695 --> 01:15:47,695
That must be right.

2201
01:15:47,696 --> 01:15:49,394
- What?
- Sae Ho, you are correct.

2202
01:15:49,395 --> 01:15:51,365
(Sae Ho is correct!)

2203
01:15:51,465 --> 01:15:52,865
Why have dried pollack?

2204
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,504
I've never seen Se Yoon order dried pollack.

2205
01:15:55,505 --> 01:15:56,505
- Right.
- Same here.

2206
01:15:56,535 --> 01:16:02,975
(Joon made the decision and Se Yoon was appalled.)

2207
01:16:03,415 --> 01:16:04,975
Sae Ho got it right.

2208
01:16:05,475 --> 01:16:07,685
- Here's the next question.
- Right.

2209
01:16:08,485 --> 01:16:10,715
The two members...

2210
01:16:10,885 --> 01:16:12,484
went to a coin karaoke.

2211
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:13,825
(The two went to a coin karaoke.)

2212
01:16:13,985 --> 01:16:15,155
They did a lot of things.

2213
01:16:15,895 --> 01:16:19,364
Out of the following, which song did these two sing first?

2214
01:16:19,365 --> 01:16:20,595
Gosh, this one is hard.

2215
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:22,225
"You In My Faded Memories,"

2216
01:16:22,665 --> 01:16:23,765
"Aspirin,"

2217
01:16:24,035 --> 01:16:25,395
"We Are the Future."

2218
01:16:26,135 --> 01:16:27,564
- and "Airplane."
- Jong Min.

2219
01:16:27,565 --> 01:16:28,934
- Jong Min.
- "We Are the Future."

2220
01:16:28,935 --> 01:16:30,104
- I was going to say that one.
- It's that one.

2221
01:16:30,105 --> 01:16:31,404
Joon loves that song.

2222
01:16:31,405 --> 01:16:33,074
He always sings that one.

2223
01:16:33,075 --> 01:16:37,245
(It was a good deduction, but it was the second song!)

2224
01:16:38,075 --> 01:16:39,945
- Jong Min, you are incorrect!
- Sae Ho!

2225
01:16:40,245 --> 01:16:41,985
- Sae Ho.
- "You In My Faded Memories."

2226
01:16:42,915 --> 01:16:45,384
- We sang that one in the car.
- Right.

2227
01:16:45,385 --> 01:16:47,725
It starts with, "misty rain."

2228
01:16:48,155 --> 01:16:53,125
(Joon in Sae Ho's faded memories)

2229
01:16:53,395 --> 01:16:56,194
I think they would've sung "You In My Faded Memories..."

2230
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:58,195
with sentimental vibes.

2231
01:16:58,635 --> 01:16:59,664
Sae Ho, you are correct.

2232
01:16:59,665 --> 01:17:00,705
(Sae Ho is correct again!)

2233
01:17:00,835 --> 01:17:02,975
(This is so exciting!)

2234
01:17:03,205 --> 01:17:04,335
I don't want to play.

2235
01:17:04,975 --> 01:17:06,605
- Why not?
- Why not?

2236
01:17:06,805 --> 01:17:08,304
- Anyone would've answered it.
- You should drop out then.

2237
01:17:08,305 --> 01:17:10,275
- You got two questions right.
- Right.

2238
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:11,774
Sae Ho is doing well.

2239
01:17:11,775 --> 01:17:13,514
- Right.
- Sae Ho got two questions right.

2240
01:17:13,515 --> 01:17:14,645
All right, everyone.

2241
01:17:14,845 --> 01:17:18,654
What score did they get after singing "You In My Faded Memories?"

2242
01:17:18,655 --> 01:17:20,355
- How can we guess that?
- Sae Ho.

2243
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:22,284
- Sae Ho.
- They wouldn't have stayed still...

2244
01:17:22,285 --> 01:17:24,024
to sing that song.

2245
01:17:24,025 --> 01:17:25,494
- Right.
- They would've been silly...

2246
01:17:25,495 --> 01:17:28,925
and points would've been dropped.

2247
01:17:29,235 --> 01:17:30,795
I predict it to be 89 points.

2248
01:17:31,095 --> 01:17:32,964
I thought it would be around that score as well.

2249
01:17:32,965 --> 01:17:34,605
- Up!
- DinDin.

2250
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:36,935
It's 99 points.

2251
01:17:37,205 --> 01:17:38,604
After singing it together,

2252
01:17:38,605 --> 01:17:39,944
(They would've hugged each other in joy after seeing the score.)

2253
01:17:39,945 --> 01:17:41,345
they might've hugged each other.

2254
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:44,215
Up!

2255
01:17:44,275 --> 01:17:45,575
- Jong Min!
- Sae Ho!

2256
01:17:45,715 --> 01:17:46,814
(Nice one!)

2257
01:17:46,815 --> 01:17:48,084
- It's me!
- No!

2258
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:49,584
- It's me!
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

2259
01:17:49,585 --> 01:17:51,915
(In despair)

2260
01:17:52,055 --> 01:17:53,655
- You already went!
- Jong Min.

2261
01:17:54,355 --> 01:17:55,425
They got 100 points!

2262
01:17:55,955 --> 01:17:57,455
- Jong Min, you are correct.
- Yes!

2263
01:17:57,525 --> 01:17:58,654
- What's the reason?
- What's the reason?

2264
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,271
- Because they did a great job.
- Make it sound interesting.

2265
01:18:00,295 --> 01:18:02,795
- They did a great job.
- Make it sound interesting.

2266
01:18:03,195 --> 01:18:04,634
(Disappointed)

2267
01:18:04,635 --> 01:18:06,041
- He called out "up" right after 99.
- Right.

2268
01:18:06,065 --> 01:18:07,105
All right.

2269
01:18:07,365 --> 01:18:09,005
Here's the next question.

2270
01:18:09,905 --> 01:18:11,675
This was asked to the two members.

2271
01:18:12,235 --> 01:18:15,304
If you could bring one more member with you,

2272
01:18:15,305 --> 01:18:16,545
who would you like to bring?

2273
01:18:16,615 --> 01:18:17,735
After hearing this question,

2274
01:18:17,775 --> 01:18:19,074
Who would I like to bring?

2275
01:18:19,075 --> 01:18:20,445
Who did Joon mention?

2276
01:18:21,015 --> 01:18:22,015
- DinDin.
- Sae Ho.

2277
01:18:23,015 --> 01:18:24,784
- It's DinDin.
- I was going to say him as well.

2278
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:26,084
- I know the answer. It's not you.
- Here's why.

2279
01:18:26,085 --> 01:18:27,285
- Jong Min!
- Joon...

2280
01:18:27,385 --> 01:18:28,624
called me last week all of a sudden.

2281
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:30,824
He said he was around my place and asked if he could visit.

2282
01:18:30,825 --> 01:18:33,824
He came and hung out with me for around 40 minutes.

2283
01:18:33,825 --> 01:18:34,965
- Really?
- Yes.

2284
01:18:35,095 --> 01:18:37,194
That's how close we are now.

2285
01:18:37,195 --> 01:18:38,394
Really?

2286
01:18:38,395 --> 01:18:40,004
- DinDin.
- Jong Min.

2287
01:18:40,005 --> 01:18:41,065
(We hope you get closer.)

2288
01:18:41,465 --> 01:18:42,674
I said my name first.

2289
01:18:42,675 --> 01:18:44,475
- Who's next?
- Seon Ho was faster.

2290
01:18:44,705 --> 01:18:45,835
Sae Ho.

2291
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:47,444
They joined the show at the same time.

2292
01:18:47,445 --> 01:18:49,004
Jong Min. No.

2293
01:18:49,005 --> 01:18:50,574
I'm sure it's wrong. Jong Min.

2294
01:18:50,575 --> 01:18:51,614
- Incorrect.
- Jong Min.

2295
01:18:51,615 --> 01:18:54,184
- It's me.
- It's me.

2296
01:18:54,185 --> 01:18:56,466
- I said my name first.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2297
01:18:56,585 --> 01:18:58,054
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2298
01:18:58,055 --> 01:18:59,485
I won.

2299
01:19:00,155 --> 01:19:02,285
(A magic where a rock turns into scissors)

2300
01:19:02,825 --> 01:19:05,094
(All right. You go first.)

2301
01:19:05,095 --> 01:19:06,325
Okay. Sae Ho.

2302
01:19:06,595 --> 01:19:08,165
(Hesitant)

2303
01:19:08,495 --> 01:19:09,895
Se Yoon is already there.

2304
01:19:09,965 --> 01:19:12,094
It's 50-50 now.

2305
01:19:12,095 --> 01:19:13,635
- It's Jong Min or Seon Ho.
- Yes.

2306
01:19:13,835 --> 01:19:14,935
Seon Ho.

2307
01:19:15,465 --> 01:19:17,075
Seon Ho. With Seon Ho around,

2308
01:19:17,305 --> 01:19:19,445
- Joon would be comfortable.
- Jong Min.

2309
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,175
He got it right again?

2310
01:19:21,445 --> 01:19:22,505
Correct.

2311
01:19:23,115 --> 01:19:24,115
Why?

2312
01:19:24,615 --> 01:19:26,445
Joon said this.

2313
01:19:27,015 --> 01:19:28,385
I'll choose Yoo Seon Ho.

2314
01:19:28,545 --> 01:19:29,585
Why is that?

2315
01:19:29,685 --> 01:19:31,815
I gave him a hard time recently. I feel bad for him.

2316
01:19:32,215 --> 01:19:33,984
Because he gave him a hard time recently.

2317
01:19:33,985 --> 01:19:35,684
He wanted to go together and take good care of him.

2318
01:19:35,685 --> 01:19:37,355
Joon gave Seon Ho a hard time?

2319
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:38,795
When did he do that?

2320
01:19:38,855 --> 01:19:41,025
- He gave me a hard time?
- He didn't mind at all.

2321
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:44,995
Which member would you like to come to Ulleung Island?

2322
01:19:45,295 --> 01:19:46,535
What's Se Yoon's choice?

2323
01:19:47,435 --> 01:19:48,865
Who should I bring?

2324
01:19:49,305 --> 01:19:50,604
- DinDin.
- DinDin.

2325
01:19:50,605 --> 01:19:52,505
- Se Yoon?
- Cho Sae Ho.

2326
01:19:52,605 --> 01:19:53,805
I think it's Sae Ho.

2327
01:19:53,945 --> 01:19:54,945
Correct.

2328
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:56,975
DinDin, correct.

2329
01:19:58,415 --> 01:20:00,814
- Right?
- "Because he's my friend Sae Ho."

2330
01:20:00,815 --> 01:20:02,145
Okay.

2331
01:20:03,385 --> 01:20:05,465
I should take care of my friend. I'll choose Sae Ho.

2332
01:20:06,155 --> 01:20:07,885
- It's touching, isn't it?
- Really?

2333
01:20:08,325 --> 01:20:09,325
Se Yoon.

2334
01:20:09,325 --> 01:20:10,325
(Deeply touched)

2335
01:20:10,326 --> 01:20:11,655
My friend Se Yoon.

2336
01:20:12,325 --> 01:20:13,395
I'll see you soon.

2337
01:20:13,925 --> 01:20:15,125
Thank you for everything.

2338
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:17,264
- Thanks.
- Okay. I'm in second place.

2339
01:20:17,265 --> 01:20:19,405
All right. What's the current score?

2340
01:20:19,605 --> 01:20:21,605
- Three, two, and one. Right?
- Yes.

2341
01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:24,334
The two members slept...

2342
01:20:24,335 --> 01:20:25,605
on the cruise last night.

2343
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:28,775
The production crew secretly went to their room...

2344
01:20:29,005 --> 01:20:31,714
and measured Se Yoon's snoring.

2345
01:20:31,715 --> 01:20:33,245
- By decibels?
- I see.

2346
01:20:33,445 --> 01:20:35,614
How many decibels do you think it was?

2347
01:20:35,615 --> 01:20:38,315
I'll give you some reference numbers.

2348
01:20:39,325 --> 01:20:41,725
A phone ringing is 70 decibels,

2349
01:20:42,055 --> 01:20:44,625
a passing train is 100 decibels,

2350
01:20:45,595 --> 01:20:49,065
and a car horn is 110 decibels.

2351
01:20:49,565 --> 01:20:50,634
- Seon Ho.
- Yes.

2352
01:20:50,635 --> 01:20:52,164
- It's 88.
- It has to be higher than that.

2353
01:20:52,165 --> 01:20:53,405
- Up.
- Sae Ho.

2354
01:20:53,805 --> 01:20:54,835
It's 103.

2355
01:20:55,235 --> 01:20:56,304
- Down.
- Down?

2356
01:20:56,305 --> 01:20:57,404
- DinDin.
- Yes.

2357
01:20:57,405 --> 01:20:58,474
It's 98.

2358
01:20:58,475 --> 01:20:59,745
Jong Min.

2359
01:20:59,845 --> 01:21:01,074
- Did you say 98?
- Is it correct?

2360
01:21:01,075 --> 01:21:02,345
- Jong Min.
- Down.

2361
01:21:02,405 --> 01:21:04,075
- Up.
- Jong Min.

2362
01:21:04,975 --> 01:21:06,385
(The answer is between 98 and 103.)

2363
01:21:06,515 --> 01:21:07,645
It's 101.

2364
01:21:08,145 --> 01:21:09,185
Did you say 101?

2365
01:21:09,515 --> 01:21:10,515
Jong Min, that's correct.

2366
01:21:10,516 --> 01:21:11,585
(Jong Min got it right.)

2367
01:21:11,855 --> 01:21:12,855
Yes!

2368
01:21:13,825 --> 01:21:15,154
(The answer is 101 decibels.)

2369
01:21:15,155 --> 01:21:17,255
It was louder than a passing train.

2370
01:21:17,895 --> 01:21:20,395
Isn't sleeping with Se Yoon technically a penalty?

2371
01:21:20,825 --> 01:21:22,064
We should add that to the list of penalties.

2372
01:21:22,065 --> 01:21:23,235
It's louder than you think.

2373
01:21:23,365 --> 01:21:26,504
There should be sleeping outdoors and sleeping with Se Yoon.

2374
01:21:26,505 --> 01:21:29,205
Right. It's like a train is passing by every two seconds.

2375
01:21:30,005 --> 01:21:31,434
Do we have one more question?

2376
01:21:31,435 --> 01:21:33,074
- What?
- Why one more?

2377
01:21:33,075 --> 01:21:35,044
It's a tie. It should be the final.

2378
01:21:35,045 --> 01:21:37,174
We should have a 2nd-place match. The 1st place is decided.

2379
01:21:37,175 --> 01:21:38,175
- Between the 2nd places.
- The 1st place...

2380
01:21:38,176 --> 01:21:39,274
- is Sae Ho.
- Okay.

2381
01:21:39,275 --> 01:21:40,684
- What?
- We should do it together.

2382
01:21:40,685 --> 01:21:42,815
If I get it right, I'll be in first place.

2383
01:21:43,285 --> 01:21:44,584
- No.
- You'll need a first-place match.

2384
01:21:44,585 --> 01:21:46,155
- Another match?
- No.

2385
01:21:46,585 --> 01:21:48,124
- I'll be in first place then.
- It's already decided.

2386
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:49,594
- Why?
- It will never end that way.

2387
01:21:49,595 --> 01:21:51,295
Is it between DinDin and me?

2388
01:21:51,795 --> 01:21:53,024
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

2389
01:21:53,025 --> 01:21:54,301
- The second-place match?
- Yes.

2390
01:21:54,325 --> 01:21:56,095
- I have to eat squid.
- All right.

2391
01:21:56,665 --> 01:21:58,535
Yesterday, Joon...

2392
01:21:58,995 --> 01:22:00,134
and Director Ho Shin...

2393
01:22:00,135 --> 01:22:02,935
played a game called Chair Levitation.

2394
01:22:03,205 --> 01:22:04,605
They did a lot of things yesterday.

2395
01:22:05,205 --> 01:22:07,374
Between Joon and Ho Shin,

2396
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:09,055
- who do you think won the game?
- DinDin.

2397
01:22:09,275 --> 01:22:10,714
I think Ho Shin won.

2398
01:22:10,715 --> 01:22:12,314
DinDin chose Ho Shin.

2399
01:22:12,315 --> 01:22:13,614
I'll go with Joon.

2400
01:22:13,615 --> 01:22:16,854
When Ho Shin is on TV,

2401
01:22:16,855 --> 01:22:19,885
he tries not to show his weak side.

2402
01:22:19,985 --> 01:22:21,455
- He's...
- He tries his best?

2403
01:22:21,585 --> 01:22:22,894
- He wants to look...
- I know what you mean.

2404
01:22:22,895 --> 01:22:24,355
Like a perfect man.

2405
01:22:24,895 --> 01:22:26,994
He must've done it with gritted teeth...

2406
01:22:26,995 --> 01:22:28,765
even if his arms were about to break.

2407
01:22:29,595 --> 01:22:32,034
Jong Min, you chose Joon.

2408
01:22:32,035 --> 01:22:33,764
Anyway, he's...

2409
01:22:33,765 --> 01:22:34,965
a TV personality, after all.

2410
01:22:35,065 --> 01:22:38,105
When there are cameras, Ho Shin can feel nervous.

2411
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:39,604
(Who will get the snack allowance of 5 dollars?)

2412
01:22:39,605 --> 01:22:40,675
The winner is...

2413
01:22:41,105 --> 01:22:42,105
Jong Min.

2414
01:22:42,775 --> 01:22:43,815
Really?

2415
01:22:44,075 --> 01:22:45,544
I didn't do anything.

2416
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:46,921
(He got three questions right without doing anything.)

2417
01:22:46,945 --> 01:22:48,515
- Joon won.
- Why?

2418
01:22:49,045 --> 01:22:50,214
Joon is good.

2419
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,614
Right. Joon is a muscle man.

2420
01:22:52,615 --> 01:22:54,754
- My goodness.
- Ho Shin is useless.

2421
01:22:54,755 --> 01:22:55,785
Yes!

2422
01:22:55,925 --> 01:22:57,354
(Sae Ho, 1st place, 10 dollars, Jong Min, 2nd place, 5 dollars)

2423
01:22:57,355 --> 01:22:59,125
- Thank you.
- All right then.

2424
01:22:59,225 --> 01:23:00,594
Okay.

2425
01:23:00,595 --> 01:23:01,894
(The winners' fun snack shopping time)

2426
01:23:01,895 --> 01:23:04,334
I'll have some soymilk...

2427
01:23:04,335 --> 01:23:05,495
and sausages.

2428
01:23:05,735 --> 01:23:08,865
And then a hot Americano.

2429
01:23:09,205 --> 01:23:11,474
- What about you, Jong Min?
- I'll have beef jerky.

2430
01:23:11,475 --> 01:23:12,945
That's a big one.

2431
01:23:13,045 --> 01:23:15,705
When the cameras were off, he said he'd eat squid.

2432
01:23:16,315 --> 01:23:19,115
They don't have beef jerky today. They have grilled squid instead.

2433
01:23:19,515 --> 01:23:21,644
- Will you change your choice?
- Squid?

2434
01:23:21,645 --> 01:23:23,045
Do they have half-dried squid then?

2435
01:23:26,155 --> 01:23:28,624
(I want to eat beef jerky.)

2436
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:29,794
Jong Min, will you change your choice?

2437
01:23:29,795 --> 01:23:31,194
- I'll have squid.
- Squid.

2438
01:23:31,195 --> 01:23:33,235
I'm going to Ulleung Island, so I should eat squid.

2439
01:23:33,965 --> 01:23:35,394
Everyone.

2440
01:23:35,395 --> 01:23:36,994
- The sausage is a little...
- Is this it?

2441
01:23:36,995 --> 01:23:38,035
What?

2442
01:23:38,335 --> 01:23:40,034
What is this squid?

2443
01:23:40,035 --> 01:23:41,835
(It's quite different from what he expected.)

2444
01:23:42,235 --> 01:23:44,205
My goodness. It looks delicious, though.

2445
01:23:44,935 --> 01:23:47,044
This is our first time going to Ulleung Island together.

2446
01:23:47,045 --> 01:23:48,404
- Right.
- Have some sausage.

2447
01:23:48,405 --> 01:23:49,975
Thanks.

2448
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,144
- Share the squid with us.
- Is the squid good?

2449
01:23:52,145 --> 01:23:53,415
- No.
- You won't?

2450
01:23:53,685 --> 01:23:55,014
(I'll eat the squid all by myself.)

2451
01:23:55,015 --> 01:23:56,084
Give me some.

2452
01:23:56,085 --> 01:23:57,485
(I'll eat the squid all by myself.)

2453
01:23:57,515 --> 01:23:59,385
The other team...

2454
01:23:59,755 --> 01:24:01,024
is having breakfast now.

2455
01:24:01,025 --> 01:24:02,124
- Really?
- What?

2456
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,425
Do they get to eat breakfast?

2457
01:24:03,595 --> 01:24:04,595
Yes.

2458
01:24:04,596 --> 01:24:05,694
(1 hour ago, Sadong Port on Ulleung Island)

2459
01:24:05,695 --> 01:24:06,894
The weather is nice.

2460
01:24:06,895 --> 01:24:08,695
The weather is great.

2461
01:24:09,165 --> 01:24:10,594
The weather is really nice.

2462
01:24:10,595 --> 01:24:11,771
(Se Yoon and Joon finally arrived at Ulleung Island.)

2463
01:24:11,795 --> 01:24:14,664
You have some time left until the other members come.

2464
01:24:14,665 --> 01:24:16,574
We will wait while having breakfast.

2465
01:24:16,575 --> 01:24:17,904
- That sounds good. Let's go.
- All right.

2466
01:24:17,905 --> 01:24:19,434
- I'd love that.
- Let's eat breakfast.

2467
01:24:19,435 --> 01:24:20,755
- We should eat breakfast.
- Yes.

2468
01:24:21,945 --> 01:24:24,544
So, this is Ulleung Island.

2469
01:24:24,545 --> 01:24:25,915
This is Ulleung Island.

2470
01:24:26,815 --> 01:24:29,014
- Tell them to come to Dodong Port.
- Dodong Port.

2471
01:24:29,015 --> 01:24:30,214
Let's eat.

2472
01:24:30,215 --> 01:24:32,414
- It must be delicious.
- Hello.

2473
01:24:32,415 --> 01:24:34,124
- Hello.
- You should sit there.

2474
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:35,584
- Already...
- The slim one should sit there.

2475
01:24:35,585 --> 01:24:36,895
There are a lot of people here.

2476
01:24:37,295 --> 01:24:39,025
They were on the boat yesterday.

2477
01:24:39,055 --> 01:24:41,295
Really? Were there so many people?

2478
01:24:41,495 --> 01:24:44,735
I think there are 4 or 5 times as many.

2479
01:24:44,965 --> 01:24:47,105
We have so many people only for three cameras?

2480
01:24:47,705 --> 01:24:48,935
That's strange.

2481
01:24:49,065 --> 01:24:50,734
Just stay quiet. You're embarrassing me.

2482
01:24:50,735 --> 01:24:51,904
(There are always many people. Is this your first shoot or what?)

2483
01:24:51,905 --> 01:24:53,744
They all were there yesterday.

2484
01:24:53,745 --> 01:24:55,945
It's just that you didn't see them.

2485
01:24:56,105 --> 01:24:57,745
- They were there. Sure.
- Really?

2486
01:24:57,815 --> 01:25:00,044
For today's breakfast, we prepared thistle hangover soup,

2487
01:25:00,045 --> 01:25:01,614
a local dish of Ulleung Island.

2488
01:25:01,615 --> 01:25:02,744
Thistle from the mainland...

2489
01:25:02,745 --> 01:25:04,314
- has a lot of thorns, right?
- Yes.

2490
01:25:04,315 --> 01:25:06,384
But thistle from Ulleung Island has almost no thorns...

2491
01:25:06,385 --> 01:25:07,625
and is very soft.

2492
01:25:07,755 --> 01:25:09,275
So it is said to be a famous delicacy.

2493
01:25:09,955 --> 01:25:11,854
- My goodness.
- So, this is thistle.

2494
01:25:11,855 --> 01:25:13,925
This looks amazing.

2495
01:25:14,095 --> 01:25:16,024
(Trying the soup in a hurry)

2496
01:25:16,025 --> 01:25:17,834
My goodness. This is right up my alley.

2497
01:25:17,835 --> 01:25:19,165
I love it.

2498
01:25:19,495 --> 01:25:21,265
(Slurping)

2499
01:25:21,465 --> 01:25:24,134
It tastes like yukgaejang with a clean taste.

2500
01:25:24,135 --> 01:25:26,275
- It's really good. I love it.
- It's delicious.

2501
01:25:26,305 --> 01:25:28,544
It tastes like going back to the old days.

2502
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:29,575
The taste of home.

2503
01:25:29,915 --> 01:25:30,944
Where's your hometown?

2504
01:25:30,945 --> 01:25:32,415
- Seoul.
- Are you kidding me?

2505
01:25:33,645 --> 01:25:34,685
Are you kidding me?

2506
01:25:34,885 --> 01:25:36,685
Is this the taste of Seoul?

2507
01:25:37,055 --> 01:25:39,015
It's so clear and delicious.

2508
01:25:39,215 --> 01:25:41,654
It tastes like a mixture of beef gukbap and yukgaejang,

2509
01:25:41,655 --> 01:25:42,884
- but it's clear, right?
- Yes.

2510
01:25:42,885 --> 01:25:44,924
- This is amazing.
- It's the taste of home.

2511
01:25:44,925 --> 01:25:45,955
(He loves it.)

2512
01:25:47,265 --> 01:25:48,665
I think he's the owner. Hello, sir.

2513
01:25:49,565 --> 01:25:50,865
You're wearing a gold necklace.

2514
01:25:51,565 --> 01:25:53,665
You are more fashionable than we are.

2515
01:25:53,805 --> 01:25:55,205
Sir, if we order...

2516
01:25:55,305 --> 01:25:56,734
more thistle hangover soup, can we get it right away?

2517
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:58,034
- Yes.
- It's pre-made soup, right?

2518
01:25:58,035 --> 01:26:01,174
Ulleung Island has no snakes or wild animals in the mountains.

2519
01:26:01,175 --> 01:26:02,275
No mountain animals?

2520
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:05,044
So the trees and plants from the mountains are soft.

2521
01:26:05,045 --> 01:26:06,684
Because there are no natural enemies.

2522
01:26:06,685 --> 01:26:07,815
I see.

2523
01:26:07,845 --> 01:26:10,155
- So the thistle is thornless.
- I see.

2524
01:26:10,385 --> 01:26:12,685
So it has been widely used...

2525
01:26:13,455 --> 01:26:15,585
as food and medicine on Ulleung Island.

2526
01:26:15,685 --> 01:26:17,254
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

2527
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:18,331
(Thank you for the kind explanation.)

2528
01:26:18,355 --> 01:26:19,394
This is crazy.

2529
01:26:19,395 --> 01:26:24,665
(The taste is even more special after hearing the explanation.)

2530
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:27,305
My goodness.

2531
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:28,964
This is really good.

2532
01:26:28,965 --> 01:26:30,474
The soup is amazing.

2533
01:26:30,475 --> 01:26:32,435
This is a great hangover soup.

2534
01:26:32,575 --> 01:26:34,015
It seems like you enjoyed your meal.

2535
01:26:34,305 --> 01:26:36,245
Why don't you take out your own cards then?

2536
01:26:36,975 --> 01:26:38,414
I didn't bring my card with me.

2537
01:26:38,415 --> 01:26:39,614
- My own card?
- Yes. Please take it out.

2538
01:26:39,615 --> 01:26:41,344
I didn't bring my card. What do I do?

2539
01:26:41,345 --> 01:26:42,584
Why is that?

2540
01:26:42,585 --> 01:26:45,114
We will play a game with your cards...

2541
01:26:45,115 --> 01:26:46,595
to decide who will pay for breakfast.

2542
01:26:49,455 --> 01:26:51,955
But it's a 50-percent chance already.

2543
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:53,994
You should take out your card as well.

2544
01:26:53,995 --> 01:26:56,064
To play fair and square, I'll give you my own card.

2545
01:26:56,065 --> 01:26:57,694
(The director's card)

2546
01:26:57,695 --> 01:26:59,294
- All right then.
- But...

2547
01:26:59,295 --> 01:27:01,435
But why are we doing this?

2548
01:27:01,805 --> 01:27:03,904
We're being too obedient. Why are we doing this?

2549
01:27:03,905 --> 01:27:06,544
- He's right. We're too nice.
- You should tell us why.

2550
01:27:06,545 --> 01:27:08,875
It would feel good to treat people to a nice meal.

2551
01:27:08,945 --> 01:27:11,545
- It does feel good, but...
- It does feel good.

2552
01:27:12,175 --> 01:27:14,175
Now that I think of it, you were right about that.

2553
01:27:14,415 --> 01:27:16,696
I think there are people who are not our production crew.

2554
01:27:16,915 --> 01:27:18,214
There are strangers too.

2555
01:27:18,215 --> 01:27:19,614
They will give you a big hand.

2556
01:27:19,615 --> 01:27:21,485
We had all these people yesterday?

2557
01:27:22,025 --> 01:27:23,025
I don't think so.

2558
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:24,854
Look. We won't get picked so easily.

2559
01:27:24,855 --> 01:27:28,125
Do you know why? Old people like gold color.

2560
01:27:28,365 --> 01:27:30,235
Right. Whose card is gold?

2561
01:27:30,295 --> 01:27:31,295
This one.

2562
01:27:31,296 --> 01:27:32,535
- The director's?
- Yes.

2563
01:27:32,695 --> 01:27:34,264
We will ask the restaurant owner to pick a card.

2564
01:27:34,265 --> 01:27:35,334
No. You might talk to him.

2565
01:27:35,335 --> 01:27:37,135
Sir, we'd like to pay.

2566
01:27:37,235 --> 01:27:38,635
- Could you do us a favor?
- Sure.

2567
01:27:39,105 --> 01:27:40,675
How much is it?

2568
01:27:40,905 --> 01:27:43,174
It's about 460 dollars.

2569
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:44,915
(The total amount is about 460 dollars.)

2570
01:27:44,945 --> 01:27:45,975
Is it 460 dollars?

2571
01:27:46,215 --> 01:27:47,215
Okay.

2572
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:50,155
We will give you three different cards.

2573
01:27:50,215 --> 01:27:52,114
We'd like you to choose...

2574
01:27:52,115 --> 01:27:53,684
- a card you like the most.
- Okay.

2575
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,324
I love your bracelet.

2576
01:27:55,325 --> 01:27:56,954
Is this the right placement?

2577
01:27:56,955 --> 01:27:58,995
(He's wearing a gold necklace and a gold bracelet.)

2578
01:27:59,055 --> 01:28:00,525
I guess you like gold.

2579
01:28:01,095 --> 01:28:02,924
- I got this as a gift.
- Really?

2580
01:28:02,925 --> 01:28:05,265
- I love it.
- Who wouldn't like gold?

2581
01:28:05,595 --> 01:28:06,764
(He's blatantly asking him to pick the gold card.)

2582
01:28:06,765 --> 01:28:08,165
All right. Please pick a card.

2583
01:28:08,235 --> 01:28:09,534
(He places the gold card on top to make it more visible.)

2584
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:10,874
Please pick a card.

2585
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:12,074
Who wouldn't like gold?

2586
01:28:12,075 --> 01:28:13,405
(What would he choose?)

2587
01:28:14,005 --> 01:28:17,515
(Who will be generously paying 460 dollars here?)

2588
01:28:17,715 --> 01:28:18,975
Who wouldn't like gold?

2589
01:28:19,615 --> 01:28:21,084
Okay!

2590
01:28:21,085 --> 01:28:22,421
(He grabs the gold card as if possessed.)

2591
01:28:22,445 --> 01:28:25,715
(The owner happens to be a gold enthusiast.)

2592
01:28:25,815 --> 01:28:26,954
Would you like to pay with this card?

2593
01:28:26,955 --> 01:28:28,525
- Yes, please.
- Yes.

2594
01:28:28,655 --> 01:28:29,975
You can pay it a couple of times.

2595
01:28:30,725 --> 01:28:32,594
He really loves gold.

2596
01:28:32,595 --> 01:28:33,864
I love his bracelet.

2597
01:28:33,865 --> 01:28:35,324
He picked the gold card right away without hesitation.

2598
01:28:35,325 --> 01:28:36,394
That was incredible.

2599
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:38,334
- It was incredible.
- I enjoyed that.

2600
01:28:38,335 --> 01:28:40,565
Okay. Let's all get a beverage.

2601
01:28:41,105 --> 01:28:42,434
One each.

2602
01:28:42,435 --> 01:28:44,204
It's on the celebrity!

2603
01:28:44,205 --> 01:28:45,635
(The celeb buys the coffee!)

2604
01:28:46,805 --> 01:28:47,844
(The director paid.)

2605
01:28:47,845 --> 01:28:49,575
No red bean bingsu!

2606
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:51,045
I enjoyed that.

2607
01:28:51,215 --> 01:28:52,345
It was delicious.

2608
01:28:53,315 --> 01:28:56,444
(The crew enjoyed the coffee that was Se Yoon's treat.)

2609
01:28:56,445 --> 01:28:57,815
Thistle hangover soup!

2610
01:28:59,385 --> 01:29:01,285
Let's get ready to welcome the others.

2611
01:29:01,625 --> 01:29:03,025
They're here already?

2612
01:29:03,455 --> 01:29:06,095
It's not "already" actually. It'll be noon soon.

2613
01:29:06,995 --> 01:29:10,035
(11am, the other 4 will soon land)

2614
01:29:10,295 --> 01:29:12,095
The others will land soon.

2615
01:29:12,295 --> 01:29:15,034
Choose one of the two keywords.

2616
01:29:15,035 --> 01:29:16,164
We choose a keyword?

2617
01:29:16,165 --> 01:29:17,474
Yes. Pick one.

2618
01:29:17,475 --> 01:29:18,905
(What's that?)

2619
01:29:19,205 --> 01:29:21,874
(Up, down, up, up, down)

2620
01:29:21,875 --> 01:29:22,974
I choose Down.

2621
01:29:22,975 --> 01:29:24,675
- Down?
- Up!

2622
01:29:24,845 --> 01:29:26,075
- Up?
- What are you doing?

2623
01:29:26,615 --> 01:29:28,145
- Up?
- Then you get Down.

2624
01:29:28,945 --> 01:29:30,505
- It's different?
- We're splitting up?

2625
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:31,985
- Yes. One each.
- What?

2626
01:29:32,255 --> 01:29:33,324
I thought...

2627
01:29:33,325 --> 01:29:34,824
- we'd pick one together.
- Me too.

2628
01:29:34,825 --> 01:29:37,354
Why are you splitting us up when we're...

2629
01:29:37,355 --> 01:29:38,555
pretending to be newlyweds?

2630
01:29:38,595 --> 01:29:41,165
You'll each lead your own team.

2631
01:29:41,195 --> 01:29:43,264
Why us? We have zero leadership.

2632
01:29:43,265 --> 01:29:44,294
I have leadership.

2633
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:45,764
- I don't.
- With us as leaders...

2634
01:29:45,765 --> 01:29:48,104
- I don't want to lead a team.
- Give it a go.

2635
01:29:48,105 --> 01:29:49,765
Team Joon.

2636
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:52,204
(Meanwhile, on the ship?)

2637
01:29:52,205 --> 01:29:54,904
- We'll land on Ulleung Island soon.
- Okay.

2638
01:29:54,905 --> 01:29:56,574
- Before we disembark.
- What?

2639
01:29:56,575 --> 01:29:57,645
Everyone.

2640
01:29:58,145 --> 01:29:59,215
Someone can't get off?

2641
01:30:00,445 --> 01:30:04,054
Choose between Up and Down.

2642
01:30:04,055 --> 01:30:05,554
(What's that?)

2643
01:30:05,555 --> 01:30:08,154
Only two people can choose the same keyword.

2644
01:30:08,155 --> 01:30:11,394
Up is a mountain and Down is the sea.

2645
01:30:11,395 --> 01:30:12,594
It's a team thing.

2646
01:30:12,595 --> 01:30:14,364
- Shall we both go Up?
- What?

2647
01:30:14,365 --> 01:30:15,464
I'll go Down.

2648
01:30:15,465 --> 01:30:16,634
- Down?
- It's a team thing.

2649
01:30:16,635 --> 01:30:18,641
- It's a team thing.
- Shall I go Down? I choose Down.

2650
01:30:18,665 --> 01:30:20,764
We won't go skydiving or something, will we?

2651
01:30:20,765 --> 01:30:21,835
I'll go Down.

2652
01:30:22,405 --> 01:30:23,905
(Skydiving?)

2653
01:30:24,075 --> 01:30:25,775
- Down.
- Down.

2654
01:30:26,535 --> 01:30:28,205
Down. All four of us chose Down.

2655
01:30:28,645 --> 01:30:30,874
- Come on.
- We have to choose...

2656
01:30:30,875 --> 01:30:32,145
between Up and Down?

2657
01:30:32,245 --> 01:30:33,784
I chose Down first.

2658
01:30:33,785 --> 01:30:34,785
I choose Down too.

2659
01:30:34,786 --> 01:30:35,845
Why? No way.

2660
01:30:36,245 --> 01:30:38,014
Why not? I want...

2661
01:30:38,015 --> 01:30:39,215
What's this for anyway?

2662
01:30:39,855 --> 01:30:42,955
- It's gone?
- They're here. I see them.

2663
01:30:43,395 --> 01:30:44,395
(Se Yoon's foghorn sound)

2664
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:48,125
(Joon's seagull sound)

2665
01:30:48,495 --> 01:30:50,664
- I think that's them.
- It's the right name.

2666
01:30:50,665 --> 01:30:51,934
- It's them.
- Sea Star!

2667
01:30:51,935 --> 01:30:53,455
- It's them. They're here.
- Sea Star!

2668
01:30:53,935 --> 01:30:56,675
(A dance to seduce you)

2669
01:30:57,305 --> 01:30:59,505
(My pants split)

2670
01:31:00,345 --> 01:31:02,905
(They can't help but dance at the thought of seeing the others.)

2671
01:31:03,105 --> 01:31:05,075
(Shake it)

2672
01:31:05,475 --> 01:31:06,815
We're almost there.

2673
01:31:07,115 --> 01:31:08,984
It's so pretty.

2674
01:31:08,985 --> 01:31:11,255
The ridges are beautiful.

2675
01:31:11,855 --> 01:31:14,155
Be sure to feel it and take it all in.

2676
01:31:15,725 --> 01:31:17,455
Look at the color of the water.

2677
01:31:17,725 --> 01:31:19,294
- It's emerald green.
- Yes.

2678
01:31:19,295 --> 01:31:22,295
(An island that seems to float)

2679
01:31:22,725 --> 01:31:25,965
(The waves and wind create uniquely shaped cliffs, )

2680
01:31:27,135 --> 01:31:31,235
(and the emerald-green sea is home to many life forms.)

2681
01:31:31,575 --> 01:31:34,145
(An island formed by nature)

2682
01:31:34,475 --> 01:31:37,575
(Ulleung Island)

2683
01:31:37,775 --> 01:31:39,245
Hello!

2684
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:40,844
Who is it? Who are you?

2685
01:31:40,845 --> 01:31:42,284
Are there any celebrities aboard?

2686
01:31:42,285 --> 01:31:43,755
- Yes!
- Celebrities!

2687
01:31:43,815 --> 01:31:46,354
Welcome ashore.

2688
01:31:46,355 --> 01:31:48,384
I see our crew.

2689
01:31:48,385 --> 01:31:50,854
- The cameramen.
- "VJs on the Scene."

2690
01:31:50,855 --> 01:31:52,754
- The cameramen.
- They're here.

2691
01:31:52,755 --> 01:31:55,324
A horde is spilling onto Ulleung Island.

2692
01:31:55,325 --> 01:31:57,164
It's nice to meet them like this.

2693
01:31:57,165 --> 01:31:58,435
They're waving to us.

2694
01:31:58,595 --> 01:32:01,334
I see the famous Byung Jin Mo.

2695
01:32:01,335 --> 01:32:02,364
(Familiar faces appear)

2696
01:32:02,365 --> 01:32:04,305
They look cheerful and happy.

2697
01:32:04,435 --> 01:32:05,505
All of them.

2698
01:32:05,605 --> 01:32:07,005
There's Joo Jong Hyun!

2699
01:32:07,305 --> 01:32:08,505
Hello.

2700
01:32:09,345 --> 01:32:11,875
Our main director has a bright smile.

2701
01:32:11,975 --> 01:32:14,214
It's so nice. It's like they came from abroad...

2702
01:32:14,215 --> 01:32:15,985
and we're the locals.

2703
01:32:16,085 --> 01:32:17,855
It feels like we're the welcome party.

2704
01:32:18,085 --> 01:32:21,225
(The welcome performance restarts)

2705
01:32:21,955 --> 01:32:23,875
(They could be called the Ulleung Island choir.)

2706
01:32:24,155 --> 01:32:26,195
(The Ulleung Island choir's welcome performance...)

2707
01:32:26,725 --> 01:32:29,065
(gave the crew time to take their positions.)

2708
01:32:29,325 --> 01:32:33,095
We're still waiting for four celebs who suffer from...

2709
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:36,004
grave cases of Celebrity Fame Disease.

2710
01:32:36,005 --> 01:32:37,005
Hey!

2711
01:32:37,006 --> 01:32:39,135
- There they are!
- My gosh.

2712
01:32:39,275 --> 01:32:40,844
They appear at last!

2713
01:32:40,845 --> 01:32:43,204
- They showed themselves.
- Hello.

2714
01:32:43,205 --> 01:32:45,445
Did you have a good time?

2715
01:32:45,675 --> 01:32:47,785
It's dead hot so get down already.

2716
01:32:47,985 --> 01:32:50,685
We have to film another opening now.

2717
01:32:50,885 --> 01:32:53,285
What did we do to deserve this? We didn't win anything.

2718
01:32:53,425 --> 01:32:55,085
The weather's amazing.

2719
01:32:55,925 --> 01:32:57,424
(The 4 disembark with leisure.)

2720
01:32:57,425 --> 01:32:59,425
The weather's great each time we're here.

2721
01:32:59,555 --> 01:33:01,194
- Come on over.
- Hey!

2722
01:33:01,195 --> 01:33:02,424
Hello.

2723
01:33:02,425 --> 01:33:03,894
They're all dressed nicely.

2724
01:33:03,895 --> 01:33:05,795
- Have a good day.
- Join us for a trip.

2725
01:33:06,735 --> 01:33:09,335
- Did you have a good time?
- Hello!

2726
01:33:09,465 --> 01:33:12,135
It was just a few hours and I missed you guys.

2727
01:33:12,535 --> 01:33:15,374
We're your Ulleung Island tour guides Moon Se Yoon...

2728
01:33:15,375 --> 01:33:17,175
- I'm Lee Joon.
- and he's Joon.

2729
01:33:17,315 --> 01:33:19,215
(Next episode)

2730
01:33:19,415 --> 01:33:21,015
(The actual Ulleung Island trip starts.)

2731
01:33:21,745 --> 01:33:23,755
(A natural beauty that sprung from the ocean)

2732
01:33:24,415 --> 01:33:26,985
(Breathtaking scenery...)

2733
01:33:27,725 --> 01:33:30,625
(and artistic masterpieces forged by nature)

2734
01:33:31,155 --> 01:33:34,195
(In a place full of sea-green dreams)

2735
01:33:34,665 --> 01:33:37,595
(My Ulleung Island Notes)

2736
01:33:38,065 --> 01:33:41,535
(Beautifully and peacefully...)

2737
01:33:42,135 --> 01:33:45,505
(taking notes about Ulleung Island)

2738
01:33:45,905 --> 01:33:47,805
(Concentrate!)

2739
01:33:48,005 --> 01:33:51,375
(What peace? The usual happens on Ulleung Island.)

2740
01:33:51,545 --> 01:33:55,245
(The selfish real variety mindset)

2741
01:33:55,715 --> 01:33:58,685
(What comments will fill...)

2742
01:33:59,015 --> 01:34:01,185
(the members' notes on Ulleung Island?)
