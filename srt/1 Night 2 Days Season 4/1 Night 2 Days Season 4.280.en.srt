1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,710
(It's in the air!)

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,380
(Throw a 5,
and everyone gets a sleeping bag.)

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,650
Come on!

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,250
It's a five! You're a five!

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,090
Darn it.
(They get just 2 sleeping bags.)

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,090
Darn it.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,890
(Despair)

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,030
(They can't believe their reality.)

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,030
It's the worst.

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,500
- Two sleeping bags?
- Yes.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,030
- We need that instead.
- What's that?

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,840
I need a big sleeping bag.

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,240
Give one my size
and then one that's a normal size.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,440
That's just too...

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,510
- Come on.
- It'll cover three...

16
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,640
if we spread it out.

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,580
Let's move on.

18
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,580
- Okay.
- Let's go.

19
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,380
The normal one fits two,

20
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,980
and Se Yoon's can fit three.

21
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,150
I think that...

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,950
we most definitely need
pillows and blankets.

23
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,320
Didn't they say...

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,590
- we get one each?
- Yes.

25
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,060
Oh, right. We get one each.

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,560
This is what I thought.

27
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,990
To make viewers laugh,

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,600
we need to sleep on newspaper.

29
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,430
- You're not focusing, are you?
- What?

30
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,100
You're not listening
to what we're saying.

31
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,870
I'd been thinking
that this was too luxurious.

32
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,270
(This is too luxurious?)

33
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,940
The crew is providing too much.

34
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,810
He's a bit weird.

35
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,310
He doubts and suspects
if something's too easy.

36
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,310
Yes.

37
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,210
See, it's comfortable attire.

38
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,450
(Last week, we let them rest,
and he doubted everything all day.)

39
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,490
If it's tough,

40
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,150
he doubts and suspects that too.

41
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,490
What do you want?
He likes everything to be average.

42
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,390
He suspects the program
even in his car on the way home.

43
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,100
"Is this car really..."

44
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,730
"Are you driving me home?"

45
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,600
He doubts his manager.

46
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,730
Why do you make your life so hard?

47
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,040
- I'm full of suspicion.
- Just do as they say.

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,540
"Are you driving me home?"

49
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,110
"Are you taking me to my place?"

50
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,880
Here's why I said that.

51
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,010
I met a kid
in elementary school yesterday.

52
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,080
We slept in boxes last time.

53
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,050
- And rang a small gong.
- What? Where?

54
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,420
- He said...
- Oh, in the winter.

55
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,380
He said he enjoyed
that episode so much.

56
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,450
Oh, really?

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,960
(They slept in boxes
during the Real Winter Training episode.)

58
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,790
(Can you tell me what time it is?)

59
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,290
(According to Joon,)

60
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,430
(it was one kid's favorite.)

61
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,270
That's when I realized
this was the path we should take.

62
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,700
(He discovered their path?)

63
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,200
(Pretending he didn't hear)

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
(I see.)

65
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,410
Joon is really admirable,

66
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,740
but he should've been on
my show called "Earth Expedition."

67
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,540
It would wake him right up.

68
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,110
"Earth Expedition."

69
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,780
I did that program too.

70
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,180
- Sae Ho.
- What?

71
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,550
Can't we rest a bit?

72
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,320
You rest. They can cut you out.

73
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,650
This can be my segment...

74
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,920
on my channel or something.

75
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,660
When I was Chao Shu Hao,

76
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,730
in China, I was shocked too.

77
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,260
If foreigners you'd seen on TV...

78
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,930
were before you, you'd be shocked.

79
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,230
What was it like after that?

80
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,930
They couldn't recover from it.

81
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,030
Everyone.

82
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,470
- A raw fish restaurant?
- A beach?

83
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,470
- We're diving in.
- Our destination.

84
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,740
We're definitely getting wet.

85
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,570
- For three days...
- Why are we by the sea?

86
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,880
We're here to dive in.

87
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,540
Why are we by the sea?

88
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,220
We're here to do some real
wild road variety show things.

89
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,620
This is a real variety of things.

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,990
(People are enjoying
the sand and water.)

91
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,160
(Holiday goers are everywhere.)

92
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,590
- My gosh. This is...
- Isn't this too blatant?

93
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,730
Hang on. This is too much!

94
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,170
- What is this?
- It's not easy.

95
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,170
What is this?

96
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,440
- My gosh.
- What's this?

97
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,200
How many of us have to go in?

98
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,310
- Today...
- Everyone,

99
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,810
we're at Daecheon Beach.

100
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,210
Yes, we know.
This is a famous beach.

101
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,580
Then we're going
to continue filming...

102
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,350
after we change the microphones.

103
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,890
(He's clearly warning them
that they'll go into the water.)

104
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,260
(Joon is the only excited one.)

105
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,090
Why are we changing our microphones?

106
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,890
I have a stomachache.

107
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,530
(Seon Ho keeps complaining
of his stomachache. )

108
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,730
Will only one of us go in?

109
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,130
(Switching them
with waterproof microphones)

110
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,030
What? Just one of us?

111
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,600
Are you making us take them off
just in case?

112
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,710
- Yes!
- Must I take off my smartwatch?

113
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,270
Please let it be just one.

114
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,440
(Trying to greet his fans
while he's at it)

115
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,780
Everyone, you're all wearing
waterproof microphones, right?

116
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,880
- This is...
- Yes.

117
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,010
- What are we doing?
- All right.

118
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,220
The supplies for bivouac
are at stake on this mission.

119
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,320
It's called
Hold Your Breath and Dive.

120
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,220
- What? Hold Your Breath...
- Hold Your Breath and Dive.

121
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,820
- What's that?
- In front of you now...

122
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,190
are seven swim rings.

123
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,730
You will each choose one number.

124
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,960
(You will each choose one number.)

125
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,330
Grab the swim ring,

126
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,570
run straight to the water briskly,
and go into the water.

127
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,570
(It's simple. Grab the swim ring
and dive into the water.)

128
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,870
All of us?

129
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,070
You'll take turns.

130
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,510
- All of us will go in.
- However...

131
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,640
However,
as for two of the swim rings,

132
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,750
I'll be holding
onto the ropes connected to them,

133
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,350
so you can't go into the water.

134
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,620
(Out of the 7 swim rings,)

135
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,320
(only two are connected to the ropes
Director Joo will hold.)

136
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,020
(However, the rest of them
are just buried in the sand.)

137
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,590
- You'll hold them?
- Yes.

138
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,190
(He must withstand
the weight of 0.1t too.)

139
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,130
The mission is complete
when you find these two swim rings.

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,830
Then we must sacrifice ourselves
to find those two ropes.

141
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,070
Right.

142
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,170
- I'll go with number 4.
- Number 4?

143
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,270
- I want number 3.
- I want number 5.

144
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,700
I'll take number three.

145
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,110
No one chose numbers 2 and 6, right?

146
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,940
- All right then.
- Are we good?

147
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,540
Let's begin right away.

148
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,210
- I'm not sure.
- I have a bad feeling about this.

149
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,510
I'll go first. It's fine.
This will be fun anyway.

150
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,110
- All of us will have to go in.
- We'll all end up in the water.

151
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,280
- All right.
- Right. We can take a shower.

152
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,550
- What?
- Whoever doesn't go in...

153
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,890
- will sleep on the ground, right?
- Who will go first?

154
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,490
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- Let's begin.

155
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,360
All right, Sae Ho.

156
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,460
(He boldly takes off his shirt
in front of the gallery.)

157
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,890
Number five, right?

158
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,100
All right. Sae Ho chose number five.

159
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,830
- Number 5.
- Number 5.

160
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,200
Go inside the ring.
Don't grab it. Don't lift it yet.

161
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,000
- Sae Ho.
- Get ready.

162
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,440
Grab it.

163
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,740
Get ready.

164
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,180
(Get ready.)

165
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,040
Go!

166
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,380
(Will Sae Ho's swim ring
keep him safe?)

167
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,380
(Is he holding the rope?)

168
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,980
(Did they succeed
on their first try?)

169
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,050
There it is.

170
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,150
(Screaming)

171
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,650
There it is.

172
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,960
(Smiling)

173
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,360
(He holds his breath
and dives in right away.)

174
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,260
Okay.

175
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,360
(Satisfied)

176
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,430
What was that?

177
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,800
What a performance.

178
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,640
What's he doing?

179
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,900
(He shows an advanced performance
after his recovery.)

180
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,240
What a performance.
He's putting on a performance.

181
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,780
- What's he doing?
- That looks fun.

182
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,850
Are you okay?

183
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,350
(Shouting)

184
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,050
(He doesn't look okay.)

185
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,420
- Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho.

186
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,760
You failed.

187
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,660
- How was it?
- We'll all end up failing.

188
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,960
- I dove in headfirst.
- Okay.

189
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,460
My face hit the bottom.

190
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,700
Your head was stuck on the bottom.
It was like synchronized swimming.

191
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,870
I flipped over, right?

192
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,030
- Yes, like synchronized swimming.
- When I dove in,

193
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,130
my head hit the bottom.

194
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,600
- Did your head get stuck in there?
- I was surprised.

195
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,470
Who will go next?

196
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,870
- Guys.
- It feels refreshing, though.

197
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,640
- I'll go next.
- Go ahead.

198
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,350
As I'm the oldest and have
microphone number one, I'll go next.

199
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,880
- It's refreshing.
- It is?

200
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,350
Se Yoon, I'll try my best
to hold onto the rope.

201
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,580
Run as hard as you can!

202
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,320
(Will Director Joo withstand
his 0.1t weight if he succeeds?)

203
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,550
All right. Let's begin right away.

204
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,620
Se Yoon!

205
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,420
Go!

206
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,130
(Se Yoon sets out
with Swim Ring Number 1.)

207
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,160
Run as hard as you can!

208
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,970
(I'll show you
my responsibility as the eldest.)

209
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,140
(Is his swim ring connected
to Director Joo's rope?)

210
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,040
(Looking peaceful)

211
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,470
It's a dud.
(Laughing)

212
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,450
(Swim Ring Number 1 is a dud too.)

213
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,850
Gosh, darn it.

214
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,020
It's so salty.

215
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,490
(He's happy that
the staff won 2 times in a row.)

216
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,730
Gosh, darn it.

217
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,560
(Even the oldest, Se Yoon,
fails after Sae Ho.)

218
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
My gosh.

219
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,830
- But it's fun to ride the waves.
- Right.

220
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,970
Gosh, the water is cold.

221
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,140
Hey, the water is cold.

222
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,610
(Only 3 members remain.)

223
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,610
(DinDin is the third one to go.)

224
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,080
No, you can't look!

225
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,080
(As always,
he's trying to be cunning.)

226
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,420
I hope at least you don't end up
in the water. Get the right one.

227
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,290
DinDin has a good chance...

228
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,520
- when he's up against Director Joo.
- Let's try it.

229
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
Right.

230
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,130
(Among numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7,
only 2 of them are safe.)

231
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,460
Don't you get a good feeling
about number four?

232
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,930
Number four!

233
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,340
Let's go.

234
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,740
(DinDin picks his number.)

235
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,070
Here I go.

236
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,740
Get ready. DinDin.

237
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,110
(DinDin, the third member to go)

238
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,180
Go!

239
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,980
(Will DinDin, Director Joo's
natural enemy, succeed?)

240
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,020
(Disappointed)

241
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,260
(Laughing)

242
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,920
- He got a dud.
- My gosh.

243
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,960
(Even DinDin dives into the water
with a big splash.)

244
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,200
My gosh. Everyone fell down.

245
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,730
Why?

246
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,070
(What do you think?)

247
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,330
He should've gone with number two.

248
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,510
(At a glance, he looks like a kid
who's happy to play in the water.)

249
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,570
What if all of us end up
in the water leaving the safe ones?

250
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,680
(The members are facing
a big crisis now.)

251
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,110
(Even DinDin fails
with Swim Ring Number 4.)

252
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,810
- Only two of you remain.
- My gosh.

253
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,720
You must both succeed
to complete the mission.

254
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,720
- Why don't you go at the same time?
- Let's do it at the same time.

255
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,950
- Okay.
- Let's go.

256
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,250
Joon, will you choose number seven?

257
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,020
- Let's do this.
- All right.

258
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,660
You're ready, right?

259
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,260
It's got to be number seven!

260
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,900
(Looking determined)

261
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,630
Hey, you know what?
Here's what we should do.

262
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,970
It's fine if they both succeed.

263
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,900
But if only one of them succeeds,

264
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,100
- Let's push him in.
- let's push him into the water.

265
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

266
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,540
(Plotting to push them
into the water)

267
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,440
Joon, let's do a slogan
for the spirit of variety shows.

268
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,280
Well, there was a line
I wanted to say.

269
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,710
- Really? Go ahead.
- You go first.

270
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,450
- You go first.
- Go!

271
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,020
2 Days and 1 Night is a hardcore show!

272
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,990
It's a hardcore show.
Let's go. Go ahead!

273
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,290
- Let's go, variety shows!
- Let's go. Go ahead!

274
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,230
(Will they be able to acquire
the bivouac supplies?)

275
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,730
(This time around,
something is pulling Director Joo.)

276
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,660
(Did both of them succeed?)

277
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,860
- Let's go. Go ahead!
- Let's go!

278
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,140
I knew it!

279
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,970
See? I was ready to dive in,
but I survived.

280
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,880
(Seon Ho successfully dives
into the water.)

281
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,920
Joon succeeded!

282
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,960
(Although Joon succeeded,
they failed their mission.)

283
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,590
Why?

284
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,360
(Bowing)

285
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,960
(Laughing)

286
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,210
(Se Yoon and DinDin join forces
and start to chase him.)

287
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,670
Oh, no. Hold on.

288
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,880
Se Yoon!

289
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,910
(Where did Se Yoon go
in the middle of the chase?)

290
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,520
- Hey, in the middle...
- There it comes.

291
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,150
(They're enjoying the waves
to the fullest.)

292
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,730
(Come in. It's fun!)

293
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Thank you.

294
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,400
(They failed their mission.)

295
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,870
(But the members
are enjoying this moment.)

296
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,880
(It's fine
as long as they're happy now...)

297
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,740
(even though they won't have
any supplies later.)

298
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,180
(Dashing)

299
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,210
- Jong Hyun.
- Yes.

300
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,580
- "Let's wrap up. Stand there."
- Okay.

301
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,750
- "Stand in front of the water."
- Okay.

302
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,190
Then just go for it.

303
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,920
- Let's lie and push him in.
- Yes.

304
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,020
- Yes.
- Okay.

305
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,320
Let's stand in front of the water.

306
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,790
- Let's wrap up!
- Hey.

307
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,800
(Will Joon be able
to survive from the scheme?)

308
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,470
Tell us to move back,
just enough to dip our feet in.

309
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,640
Tell us to move back, just enough...

310
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,800
- to dip our feet in.
- Okay.

311
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,140
I don't think it will work.

312
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,240
- It will work.
- Let's do our best.

313
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,480
Could you move about 50cm back?

314
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,550
You should stand in the middle.
Shouldn't you?

315
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,410
All right, everyone.

316
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,450
(Checking every direction
while being on alert)

317
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,520
Hello.

318
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,190
(Sae Ho pretends to say hello
and moves back.)

319
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,020
(But Joon won't lower his guard.)

320
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,860
My gosh.
I guess the kids aren't cold.

321
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,970
It won't work. No way.

322
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,400
My gosh.

323
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,040
- Gosh, hadn't I been sick...
- Catch him, bodyguards!

324
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,440
- Come here already.
- Hadn't I been sick...

325
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,740
- We have to film.
- It won't work.

326
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,740
By the way,
let me ask you for a favor.

327
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,480
Could you buy me underwear?

328
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,310
- Okay. You got it.
- I only brought one pair. Okay.

329
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,980
- All right.
- Borrow Joon's underwear.

330
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,980
- Should I? Okay.
- Yes.

331
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,580
Let me make an announcement.

332
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,150
Come into the frame. Come on.

333
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,320
- Come on.
- We'll stop.

334
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,890
(Dry Joon won't lower his guard.)

335
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,890
I'm in the frame.

336
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,160
While we're at Daecheon Beach,

337
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,230
we're going to do
the Lunch Game here...

338
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,860
- as well.
- Okay.

339
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,030
- I have to eat lunch.
- All right.

340
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,330
- Yes.
- Let's wash up and eat. Gosh.

341
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,270
I'll tell you
today's lunch menu first.

342
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,270
Okay. What is it?

343
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,730
Daecheon Beach is famous...

344
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,170
- for grilled clams.
- Okay!

345
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,770
I can't get enough of grilled clams!

346
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,270
- All right.
- I'm serious.

347
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,540
(The clams from the west coast
are nice and plump.)

348
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,950
(The tender and chewy comfort food
from the ocean)

349
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,650
A filling meal of grilled clams
is at stake on this mission.

350
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,390
It's called the Foot Bucket Relay.

351
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,990
- Foot Bucket?
- What's "Foot Bucket?"

352
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,660
You will have five minutes...

353
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,600
to gather the seawater
in the water tank.

354
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,170
The weight of seawater you collect
will be exchanged...

355
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,870
for the same weight in clams.

356
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,140
(1kg of water will be exchanged
for 1kg of clams.)

357
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,640
All right.
Once we finish setting it up,

358
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,840
- we'll begin right away.
- Okay.

359
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,910
- Okay.
- All right.

360
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,680
We have to eat grilled clams.

361
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,010
- Hold this. Watch.
- I want grilled clams.

362
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,810
When you get the bucket,
don't put your feet on the bottom.

363
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,880
(Sharing his know-how)

364
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,280
- This is how you do it.
- You have to curl your toes.

365
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,920
- Curl your toes.
- Curl our toes.

366
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,690
- Yes. That's it.
- Yes.

367
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,120
- That's it.
- Just like that. Okay?

368
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,420
- Okay.
- My gosh.

369
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,730
Does it mean
I have to keep fetching water?

370
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,890
- Shouldn't a fast runner do that?
- So...

371
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,660
we won't have that many chances,
so be precise.

372
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,600
(Checking the weight
of the water tank before they begin)

373
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,040
All right, everyone.

374
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,170
The weight of the water tank
is 11.5kg.

375
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,150
(The weight of the water will be
measured after deducting 11.5kg.)

376
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,780
(How much water can they gather
in the water tank?)

377
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,550
I can only fetch the water
five times. So be precise.

378
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,890
- You have to be quick.
- I'm sorry.

379
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,790
All right. Okay. Get ready,

380
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,660
set...

381
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,760
How much do you think
each bucket will weigh?

382
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,460
- It will be less than 1kg, right?
- Right.

383
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,530
- Gosh, it's heavy.
- That's good. Hurry up.

384
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,940
(He's evening out the weight
even when he's in a hurry.)

385
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,310
All right, Seon Ho. Grab it nicely.
That's great.

386
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,510
(Like they practiced,
he grabs it tightly with his toes.)

387
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,480
Great.

388
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,140
(Pouring)

389
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,180
Grab that.

390
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,050
(Dry Joon went out of his way
not to get wet.)

391
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,680
(He gets wet right away.)

392
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,790
Hey, no.

393
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,890
(Joon takes over calmly.)

394
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,920
Okay.

395
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,630
(DinDin is getting ready
to take over.)

396
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,260
- My gosh, my toes hurt.
- Hold on.

397
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,500
(Se Yoon places another bucket
on Seon Ho.)

398
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,760
(Pouring)

399
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,130
Hey.

400
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,270
- My gosh, my toes hurt.
- Hold on.

401
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,870
- Hold on.
- No.

402
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,940
(Sae Ho smoothly takes over...)

403
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,740
(and pours the water into the tank
for the first time.)

404
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,710
- It's so heavy.
- This is so exhausting.

405
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,410
(Panting)

406
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,450
Hold on.

407
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,450
Hey, you guys are too slow.

408
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,790
- The water is cold!
- Grab them horizontally.

409
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,390
Hey, you guys are too slow.

410
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,860
(In the end,
Joon gets completely soaked.)

411
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,530
That's not how you do it.
Hold on. This way.

412
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,060
No. You can't let go!

413
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,230
No. You can't let go!

414
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,430
(It's been 1 minute so far.)

415
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,070
- Hey, I told you to be careful.
- Don't let go.

416
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,670
You must get the bucket
horizontally like this.

417
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,610
So that your feet make a cross.
That's it.

418
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,710
That's how you do it.

419
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,940
- Should I let go?
- Let go.

420
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,250
When you do that, I'll go to you.

421
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,880
You should get closer.

422
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,150
Then I'll take the bucket horizontally
like this.

423
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,150
Just like this.
Grab it horizontally. Yes.

424
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,020
(They manage to save
almost all of the water...)

425
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,790
(and successfully put it
in the tank.)

426
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,360
Bring it in a horizontal position.
That's it.

427
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,530
No.

428
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,760
- Should I let go?
- Let go.

429
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,730
- That's it. Bring it over.
- Yes.

430
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,330
- Wait.
- My gosh.

431
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,570
Okay. That's the way to go.

432
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,140
- This is so hard.
- Let's just put the bucket in.

433
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,570
This is so hard.

434
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,470
Run!

435
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,470
(Exhausted)

436
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,040
Se Yoon, you must run.

437
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,880
Hold on.

438
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,550
(This is for my clams.)

439
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,280
- Don't let go.
- Okay.

440
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,320
Okay.

441
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,950
Just throw the bucket in the tank.

442
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,590
(Delivering the water safely
to the tank)

443
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,620
That's it.

444
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,420
(Adding one more bucketful of water)

445
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,230
Great. We gathered a lot of water.

446
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,300
Se Yoon, hurry.

447
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,730
Hurry up! So we don't have to wait.

448
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,330
- Darn it.
- Hurry up! So there's no wait.

449
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,770
- Se Yoon, place it down properly.
- Run!

450
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,740
- Take both of the buckets and run.
- Run!

451
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,140
(This is killing me.)

452
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
(Throwing)

453
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,110
(Sae Ho kindly delivers the bucket.)

454
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,540
Hurry up!
How many minutes has it been?

455
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,510
- Two minutes.
- Hurry up!

456
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,980
(Flashing the whites of his eyes)

457
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,420
The other bucket's there too.
Hurry up.

458
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,150
(Sir, you're taking way too long.)

459
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,350
I don't want to do this job.

460
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,920
- What do you say?
- Hurry up.

461
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,290
The bucket!

462
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,290
This is exhausting.

463
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,100
Okay. We got it.

464
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,030
- Nice job. That's a lot of water.
- Lift it.

465
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,770
Turn it. This isn't going to work.

466
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,570
- This isn't going to work.
- Hold on.

467
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,200
- This... Sae Ho.
- Let me take care of it.

468
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,140
- Wait. I got it.
- Okay.

469
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,140
(Adding another bucketful of water)

470
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,980
- Gosh, my back hurts.
- End the game already.

471
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,180
It hasn't been five minutes yet?

472
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,110
- Slow down.
- Hurry up.

473
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,880
(Team Full Speed
versus Team Take It Slow)

474
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
(Screaming)

475
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,780
(Pouring)

476
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,780
- What?
- Come on!

477
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,220
(I hate this!)

478
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,290
(Joon gets splashed
as the balance shifts.)

479
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
(Annoyed)

480
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,500
- You did that on purpose!
- There's nothing we can do.

481
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,030
This is the same thing
as going into the water.

482
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Hurry up!

483
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,700
(It was a mistake,
but it sure feels great.)

484
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,970
- Hurry.
- Come on. What is this?

485
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,270
Hurry up. There's the water.

486
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,470
(Glancing)

487
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,610
I don't want this job.

488
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,180
- How much water did we get?
- We got a lot.

489
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,080
(We got a lot?)

490
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,180
Just hurry up.

491
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,010
(If that's the case...)

492
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,680
- Slow down.
- Hurry up.

493
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,320
(Seon Ho starts the relay again.)

494
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,390
(Screaming)

495
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,790
(Pouring water on him
out of the blue)

496
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,660
(Now that they have enough water,)

497
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,330
(DinDin is clearly going
after Joon.)

498
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,800
(Refreshed)

499
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,400
Hurry up, Joon!

500
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,910
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, what is this?

501
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,470
- Switch your spots.
- What is this?

502
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,940
- Switch your spots.
- My gosh.

503
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,810
- Switch your spots.
- What are you doing?

504
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,950
- Hurry up.
- It's been four minutes!

505
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,080
- Hey!
- I'm sorry.

506
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,350
I should've gone into the water
if you were going to do this.

507
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,620
How many minutes has it been?

508
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,390
It's been 4 minutes and 10 seconds.

509
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,020
My gosh, the seawater...

510
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,560
(Focus now.)

511
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,590
(A little more...)

512
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,930
- I got this.
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

513
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,460
I got this.

514
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,030
(It was clearly intentional.)

515
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,430
I'm sorry, Joon.

516
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,870
- Hurry up! It's our last one.
- Sorry.

517
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm sorry, Joon. I slipped.

518
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,410
Hurry up!

519
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,840
- I'm sorry, Joon.
- What...

520
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,140
- What is this?
- You have 30 seconds left.

521
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,380
- Listen. We've got to eat clams!
- I'm sorry.

522
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,350
You have 20 seconds left!

523
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,720
- Let's switch our spots.
- Let's switch.

524
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,280
- Hey.
- Come on. Hurry back!

525
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,490
- This is our last chance.
- Lie down!

526
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,650
- Lie down already!
- It's our last one.

527
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,160
(He gets splashed 3 times in a row.)

528
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,230
Ten seconds!

529
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,300
(DinDin ran after Se Yoon.)

530
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
Just pour it over Joon.

531
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,930
- Hurry back!
- Hurry up. Let's eat some clams.

532
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,970
(Laughing)

533
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,970
Let's switch our spots.

534
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,040
(Joon lowered his guard,
clueless he'd be pranked again.)

535
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,670
- Here it goes.
- It's our last chance.

536
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,710
(Dashing)

537
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,620
I'm sorry.

538
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,490
(Dizzy)

539
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,420
I'm sorry. My gosh.

540
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,060
My gosh. Let's go.

541
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,660
(Their time is up.)

542
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,570
Joon. Just go
and dive in like a cool guy.

543
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,300
- Joon.
- Just go and dive like a cool guy.

544
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,570
- Joon.
- It was my mistake.

545
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,840
I missed my footing at the end.

546
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,810
- The sand at this beach is uneven.
- It was a mistake.

547
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,540
- Let's all go and dive in.
- It's all bumpy.

548
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,610
What is this?

549
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,510
Gosh, Joon.

550
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,580
- Let's weigh the water.
- Okay.

551
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,180
- Let's go into the water together.
- Sounds good.

552
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,750
Gosh, this is heavy.

553
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,950
(The members gathered
a lot of water in 5 minutes.)

554
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,260
(What's the weight
of the collected seawater?)

555
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,160
Deduct some weight for the sand.

556
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,460
- We got 16kg.
- What?

557
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,190
- What? It's 16kg?
- We got 16kg.

558
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,300
- Yes.
- My gosh.

559
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,660
We gathered a lot of water.

560
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,070
That's a lot. We got 16kg.

561
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,170
(Getting soaked was worth it then.)

562
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,600
(The fruit of their labor
while getting splashed by seawater)

563
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,940
- It's 15.5kg.
- After deducting the tank's weight,

564
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,110
- It's 15.5kg.
- you got 15.5kg.

565
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,710
- My gosh.
- You succeeded.

566
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,740
- Then we'll get 15kg of clams?
- All right.

567
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,910
- Yes.
- Okay.

568
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,240
That's too much food.

569
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,710
- Well, can we share with you?
- Is that the only food we'll get?

570
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,450
- That's a lot of food.
- Everyone,

571
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:50,120
you guys gathered a lot more water
than we anticipated.

572
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,290
- Right.
- You can exchange one supply...

573
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,460
- for 5kg of clams.
- They'll give us bivouac supplies.

574
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,630
We can trade them.

575
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,160
- What do you think?
- Then...

576
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
You couldn't win some supplies.

577
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,760
If you really want to do that,
we can do it.

578
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,700
Won't 10.5kg of clams be enough?

579
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,770
- Yes. Let's get one supply.
- Yes.

580
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,840
Then how big
would 5.5kg of clams be?

581
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,200
- No. We must eat 10kg of clams.
- Won't that be enough?

582
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,640
An average serving size would be
about 1.2kg to 1.5kg.

583
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,740
- That's the average size.
- We need 10kg of clams then.

584
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,110
We'll have kalguksu with the clams, right?
They're a set, aren't they?

585
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,880
- There's no kalguksu.
- You'll only give us clams?

586
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,080
- We'll only eat clams?
- Yes.

587
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,220
No carbs?

588
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,150
How can we only eat clams?

589
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,220
- Who eats clams without soju?
- Seriously.

590
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,560
Who goes to have grilled clams
as a meal?

591
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,090
Honestly, how can I enjoy the clams
without some drinks?

592
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,060
- Let's have a drink today then.
- You must give us kalguksu.

593
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,630
- You must give us kalguksu.
- Which one should we get first?

594
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,200
- We must get the wooden bench.
- Let's get the wooden bench.

595
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,060
- We need a bench to sit on.
- The wooden bench. What about you?

596
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,300
- What?
- What do you want, Joon?

597
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,900
(He's still out of it
after getting splashed.)

598
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,940
Well...

599
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,910
- The wooden bench.
- Let's go!

600
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,910
- We'll go with the wooden bench.
- The wooden bench.

601
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,310
You got the wooden bench.

602
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,240
If you give us a bench...

603
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,710
the size of a janggi board,
I won't let that slide.

604
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,210
- You definitely said...
- If you fooled us with the photo...

605
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,650
- it was big enough for three men.
- Okay?

606
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,280
- Then we'll just play janggi.
- If you...

607
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,020
- If you give us a table...
- He said 4 or 5 of us could fit in.

608
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,320
Seriously. I'll show it to you then.

609
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
- It's 10.5kg.
- Is that it?

610
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,160
- It's 10.5kg, right?
- Yes.

611
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,520
- It's saltwater.
- I wish we knew this advance.

612
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,560
We shouldn't have pranked Joon.

613
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,190
Had we known,
we wouldn't have pranked Joon.

614
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,360
- We would've kept collecting water.
- So why did you do it?

615
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,660
If you mess around again,
I'll hurt you.

616
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,700
The weather is beautiful today.

617
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,000
Since you're already wet,
why don't you all go in the water?

618
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,340
Instead, can you give me
a swim ring? It's so much fun.

619
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,340
- Sure.
- Okay.

620
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,610
Then give us some newspaper.

621
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,140
If you give each of us
some newspaper, we'll go in.

622
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,180
- Okay.
- Okay.

623
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,050
(List of Bivouac Items)

624
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,580
(Obtained newspaper
and a wooden bench)

625
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,880
Everyone, after we say "2 Days,"

626
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,350
could you say "1 Night?"

627
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

628
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,150
- Sae Ho is doing a good job.
- 2 Days.

629
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,160
- And 1 Night.
- He was born to be a celebrity.

630
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,390
Okay.

631
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,290
We're at Daecheon Beach,

632
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,500
and we will dive in the water.

633
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,800
2 Days.

634
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,030
(Laughing)

635
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,130
(His raspy voice results
in a blooper.)

636
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,400
- I see.
- Wait.

637
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,300
"2 Days!"

638
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,340
- "2 Days!"
- Hey.

639
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,210
- You talked too much in the car.
- All right.

640
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,670
- For Jong Min...
- Here we go again.

641
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,710
Okay.

642
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,440
"2 Days!"

643
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,850
We'll dive in with a splash
at Daecheon Beach.

644
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
2 Days.

645
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,120
- And 1 Night.
- And 1 Night.

646
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,450
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's go!

647
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,750
(Encouraged by the public,
all members go in the water.)

648
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,750
Let's go.

649
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,220
(Encouraged by the public,
all members go in the water.)

650
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,790
(Splash)

651
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,300
(The young men forget
about the shoot for a while...)

652
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,130
(and dive into the summer.)

653
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:40,960
(After winter and spring,
it's the refreshing yet hot season.)

654
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:50,230
(It's summer again.)

655
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,140
(They set out to have lunch.)

656
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,480
- I'm hungry now.
- Hello.

657
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,650
(They enter the restaurant.)

658
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,610
- The weather...
- We just turned on the grill.

659
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,720
Hurry and eat.

660
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,180
Hurry up.

661
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,550
(Earned through hard work
at the beach)

662
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,320
(10kg of assorted clams)

663
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
It looks delicious.

664
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,530
(Please enjoy them with
the refreshing view of the ocean.)

665
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,960
Is this 10kg?

666
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,460
No way. I can eat
all of it by myself.

667
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,370
Instead of making a scene,
please bring some more.

668
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,240
No, let's be fair.

669
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,270
Put some pen shells on the grill.

670
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,010
- Enjoy your food.
- This is unbelievable.

671
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,180
It looks so good.

672
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,410
- Can we get some beverages?
- Guys.

673
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,950
This is unbelievable.

674
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,610
Director, could you give us
some beverages?

675
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,880
- This is all we're offering.
- What?

676
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,650
- This is all we're offering.
- I see.

677
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,490
- Usually, we can eat them raw,
- By the way...

678
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,920
but we should be careful
during the summer.

679
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,730
I just realized that
we're eating grilled clams,

680
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,230
but there are no side dishes.

681
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
They gave us only clams.

682
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,360
Mister.

683
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,000
- We got nothing but clams.
- Could we get...

684
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Grilled clams are always served
with corn with cheese.

685
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,770
As a special treatment,
I'll give you some kimchi.

686
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,540
Isn't there a side dish bar
where we serve ourselves?

687
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,380
- I mean...
- There is. I saw it on our way in.

688
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,250
It's cooked.

689
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,180
It's not cooked yet.
We have to wait.

690
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,590
- This one looks ready.
- Go ahead and eat.

691
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,320
You seem quite impatient.

692
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,960
- Usually, these are eaten raw.
- Of course.

693
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,130
Can I eat them raw?

694
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,630
Scallops are also eaten raw.

695
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,130
- That's right.
- Then let's eat them.

696
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,230
Joon, just go ahead and eat!

697
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,700
- But you're not eating.
- I'm not going to eat.

698
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,140
Try some pen shells.

699
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,270
I'll try them when they're cooked.

700
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,210
When you eat grilled clams,
there's waiting.

701
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,780
You can eat it
when it comes off the shell.

702
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,910
It came off the shell.

703
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,350
Let's eat.

704
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,580
- Let's eat a scallop each.
- Scallops.

705
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:46,920
Let's eat.

706
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,790
(Exclaiming)

707
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,960
It's delicious.

708
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,490
- Is it incredible?
- Gosh.

709
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,530
(It's delicious.)

710
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,260
(Dipped in the sauce)

711
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,100
- It's delicious.
- Is it incredible?

712
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,970
(The flavor of the sea
spreads over the palate.)

713
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,110
It's really good.

714
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,810
I'll have some cheese.

715
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,280
(Next is a golden scallop
with cheese.)

716
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,250
(Stretching out the cheese)

717
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:25,260
The Yellow Sea is famous
for grilled clams.

718
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,230
- Try it like this.
- The cheese is tasty.

719
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,160
(When a savory blanket of cheese
meets plump and firm clams)

720
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,260
Try this.

721
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,600
I don't want any cheese.

722
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,100
- You don't want it?
- I don't eat cheese.

723
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,100
Thank you.

724
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,370
(I'll eat a lot of your cheese.)

725
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,400
Isn't it good?

726
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,740
(The older members are in love
with scallops covered with cheese.)

727
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,040
Gosh, it's good.

728
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,650
- It's delicious.
- This is...

729
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,650
(Is it that delicious?)

730
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,080
Shall I try some cheese? Is it good?

731
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,350
- It's good.
- It's good.

732
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,480
- Really?
- Let me explain how to eat it.

733
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,620
- Scrape it off with a spoon.
- With a spoon?

734
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,360
- Put it all on the spoon.
- Right, try this.

735
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,420
I'm curious.

736
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,260
Is it that tasty?

737
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,430
It's very nutty.

738
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:09,470
(How will Seon Ho like
his very first scallop with cheese?)

739
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,870
- Isn't the cheese good?
- It's better than I thought.

740
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,270
(Seon Ho discovers
how tasty cheese is.)

741
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,310
(It's so good.)

742
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:26,250
(It's good, but...)

743
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,750
Do people usually eat only clams
at a grilled clam restaurant?

744
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,650
A little later...

745
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,390
I've never eaten clams like this.

746
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,690
We need to have
some kalguksu after this.

747
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,530
- Right?
- Absolutely.

748
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,230
- We need to eat some carbs.
- Yes.

749
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,430
My gosh. It opened the shell.

750
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,470
(Changing the subject)

751
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,900
Should I tell the clam to close it?

752
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,140
(Sulking)

753
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,600
- The noodles?
- Put some noodles on it.

754
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,710
Put the noodles on it.

755
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,570
- Okay.
- Let's try it.

756
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,580
- I'll try some.
- These are carbs.

757
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,180
- Let's eat.
- Go.

758
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,550
We should eat at the same time.

759
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,250
Is the sauce a little different?

760
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,520
This is good.

761
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,760
- Is it good?
- It's good.

762
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,390
Give me some kalguksu.

763
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,000
Or give us some spaghetti noodles.

764
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,530
Can't we get some noodles?

765
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,200
Shall we?

766
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
(Shall we give them some?)
Shall we do it?

767
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,740
- He's giving us some.
- It's delicious.

768
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,770
He's going to give us something.

769
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,710
You need some carbs, don't you?

770
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,170
- Yes.
- Yes, some type of noodles.

771
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,780
Your favorite, kalguksu.

772
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,480
(Seafood kalguksu)

773
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,980
Or with ramyeon on the line,

774
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,580
you'll play
a simple individual game.

775
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,580
- An individual game?
- Let's go.

776
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,650
This mission is
flipping clam shells.

777
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,190
When you were in school,

778
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,560
have you flipped a clam shell
by hitting it?

779
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,090
- Flipping a board?
- Or flip a coin.

780
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,760
- Yes.
- I'm sure you've done it.

781
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,100
Place clam shells on a book.

782
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,800
Hit the book with your hand.

783
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,500
You win when you flip
all the clam shells.

784
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,070
Okay.

785
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,440
Who wants kalguksu
and who wants ramyeon?

786
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,570
Or Coke?

787
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,210
Raise your hand for ramyeon.
One, two, three.

788
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,740
- I want ramyeon too.
- I want kalguksu.

789
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,210
Four ramyeon and one kalguksu.

790
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,710
How about this?

791
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,850
I'll pick Coke.

792
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,810
If you win ramyeon, we'll share.

793
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,920
- I'd like that.
- Okay.

794
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
- Okay?
- Okay.
I pick Coke.

795
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,750
All right, who wants to go first?

796
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,320
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

797
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,430
There he goes again.

798
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,230
Since this is an individual game,

799
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,560
you'll pick a clam shell randomly.

800
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,130
- Okay.
- I'll pick number one.

801
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,170
Number one?

802
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,770
All right.

803
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,300
What is it?

804
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,140
(Joon's choice: Ark clam)

805
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,540
As we want you to succeed,

806
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,880
we'll give you three chances.

807
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,540
It must be harder than we think.

808
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,080
If the shell falls off
from the book,

809
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,980
- you'll lose that chance.
- Okay.

810
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,980
Got it.

811
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,620
Let's see.

812
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,020
(Wrinkling)

813
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,690
Do you know how to do it?

814
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,390
He doesn't know at all.

815
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,030
(Sae Ho goes up.)

816
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,100
Instead of placing it here,
use the edge...

817
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,030
(Air on one side,
clam on the other side)

818
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,700
You have to hit it like this.

819
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,170
You have to hit it like this.

820
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,370
- Here I go.
- You must hit it carefully.

821
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,970
Joon, you have one ramyeon
on the line.

822
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,010
Okay, here I go.

823
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,050
(What will be the result?)

824
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,780
(It went up in the air.)

825
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,550
Okay.

826
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,890
Okay.

827
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,390
(Commanding)

828
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,630
- Joon succeeded.
- You're good at it.

829
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,790
(Joon succeeded.)

830
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,900
Ramyeon.

831
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,530
- Next player is up.
- Can I go?

832
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,530
Go ahead.

833
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,470
- That was very easy.
- I envy you for getting ramyeon.

834
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,400
- I want some ramyeon too.
- I'll go with number five.

835
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,070
- Number 5.
- Number 5.

836
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,380
(Clanking)

837
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,280
(This sound is...)

838
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,480
There are several inside.

839
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,320
- There are several?
- Yes.

840
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,690
- What?
- There are three clams.

841
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,220
(He picked 3 clam shells.)

842
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,060
He has to flip 3 in 1 go.

843
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,990
The game is about how many you get.

844
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,390
This is the most...

845
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,690
- My goodness.
- Isn't this the worst?

846
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,960
The clam that
Joon picked was very...

847
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,030
- Was it the easiest one?
- Yes.

848
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,230
(Joon's choice: Ark clam,
Difficulty level: 1 star)

849
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,270
You did a lot of flipping
when you were in school.

850
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,900
- Still...
- You can do it.

851
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,500
Here I go.

852
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,510
(1st try)

853
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,170
This is your first try.

854
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,310
- Out.
- Goodness.

855
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,410
This is hard.

856
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,080
It's impossible to keep them
on the book.

857
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,450
It's almost over for him.

858
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,290
Hit it gently.

859
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,790
- Here I go.
- Okay.

860
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,760
(The clams didn't get flipped.)

861
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,790
You told me to hit it gently.

862
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,790
(Getting emotional)

863
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,260
I mean... This is your last try.

864
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,600
He lost already. I feel bad for him.

865
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,970
It's over.

866
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,570
(No one is expecting him to make it.
What's the result?)

867
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,250
- Sae Ho failed.
- What?

868
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,120
But you had good energy.

869
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,280
(DinDin goes next.)

870
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,850
I am Mr. One Shot Man.

871
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,890
(How good will Mr. One Shot Man be?)

872
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,920
(1st try)

873
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,930
What?

874
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,500
(2nd try)

875
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,800
(3rd try, fail)

876
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
You failed.

877
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,630
I really want some ramyeon.

878
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,340
That's it. Flip at least one.

879
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,700
Hit it hard.

880
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,410
(However, in the end...)

881
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,040
(Yoo Seon Ho failed.)

882
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,780
(The last player)

883
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
All right.

884
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,420
Please open it.

885
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,920
Raise your hand for ramyeon.
One, two, three.

886
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,650
I want ramyeon too.

887
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,090
(When everyone wanted ramyeon)

888
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,120
I want kalguksu.

889
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,260
(He didn't want anything
but kalguksu.)

890
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,790
What is it?

891
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,130
It's only one.

892
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,530
(He picks one clam,
which is very easy.)

893
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,600
Se Yoon, don't eat any more pasta.

894
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,100
- Here I go.
- Are you starting?

895
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,370
- Start.
- Okay.

896
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,770
(1st try)

897
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,300
- Out.
- It went out.

898
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,910
He's strong.

899
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,440
(Folding)

900
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,350
(Constructing a barricade desperately)

901
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,520
(Warm kalguksu)

902
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,650
(I'm praying for you.)

903
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,690
Good luck.

904
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,990
Hit it hard.

905
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,060
(How about this time?)

906
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,160
Hit it hard.

907
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,160
(What just happened?)

908
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,530
(The clam definitely flipped.)

909
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,970
(It returns to its original position
due to too much pressure.)

910
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,540
(Screaming)

911
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,810
I almost had it.

912
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,810
(Losing his mind)

913
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:27,940
It won't work.

914
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,310
- It did a full spin.
- It won't work.

915
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,480
(He won't win either.)

916
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,220
- Do you want me to replace you?
- No.

917
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,950
If you give me a bite of kalguksu,
I'll replace you.

918
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,950
No way.

919
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,450
- This is...
- Hit it hard once.

920
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,990
My children are watching this.

921
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,390
I'll show how I take control
of my own destiny.

922
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,790
(A good dad doesn't run away
from his fate.)

923
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,560
I'll take responsibility for it
as an adult.

924
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,030
(I'm the pioneer of my own destiny.)

925
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,600
(How will the dad's
last attempt turn out?)

926
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,440
(The father succeeds.)

927
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,220
(Screaming with joy)

928
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,820
(The tourists congratulate Se Yoon
from outside.)

929
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,820
Thank you!

930
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,890
I won kalguksu.

931
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,760
(Congratulations!)

932
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,530
Thank you.

933
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,460
Okay, I made it.

934
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,230
We'll bring it to you soon.

935
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,540
- We don't get anything?
- Shall we go one more time?

936
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,670
- Goodness.
- Give us one more chance.

937
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,770
Pick a person to represent everyone.
You get only one chance.

938
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,980
If the person succeeds,
I'll give you two Coke.

939
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,650
- Okay.
- What about ramyeon?

940
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,310
The cooking time is over
for ramyeon.

941
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,380
I hope that he succeeds this time.

942
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,590
- Okay.
- Okay, that was good.

943
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,960
- I can do it.
- You can do it.

944
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,520
Okay. All right.

945
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,560
- Would you like to try?
- Start.

946
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,530
One, two, three.

947
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,530
My goodness.

948
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,540
(It's hard to believe,
but he failed.)

949
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,870
Can I do it one more time?

950
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,970
(Whispering)

951
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,910
I did it.

952
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,080
(It's so easy!)

953
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,810
I did it.

954
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,810
(He thinks it's unfair.)

955
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,910
It worked.

956
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,020
- What's the point of doing it now?
- It worked again.

957
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Start.

958
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,450
It didn't work.

959
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,690
(Sae Ho's miracle didn't happen.)

960
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,560
I'll buy each of you
1.5l of Coke next time. I'm sorry.

961
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
What, 1.5l?

962
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,860
It's ready. We'll serve you.

963
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,860
Okay.

964
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,200
It's mine. Okay.

965
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,170
This is so thrilling.

966
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,400
These scallops are bigger
than the grilled ones.

967
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,370
(With plump scallops)

968
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,570
It looks so delicious.

969
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,740
Can I have a bite?

970
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,310
You failed.

971
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,380
Never mind.

972
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,980
- Have just one bite.
- Okay.

973
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,650
Go ahead.

974
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,950
Have a bite.

975
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,650
It's okay. I won this.

976
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,020
I'll just take one bite.

977
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,250
Have it with some kimchi.

978
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,390
(The kalguksu fanatic is
also a generous giver.)

979
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,330
It's delicious.

980
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,000
(The broth is also a must.)

981
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,070
Look at the ramyeon.

982
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,070
(Ramyeon is also brought in.)

983
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,070
- The ramyeon portion is big.
- It looks insanely good.

984
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,070
- The ramyeon is to die for.
- I agree.

985
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,310
It looks incredibly good.

986
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,480
(The noodles look firm and springy.)

987
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
This is it.

988
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,020
- This is the main dish.
- Is the seafood good?

989
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,020
(Premium ramyeon
filled with seafood)

990
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,130
Because of the seafood...

991
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,030
Try some, Seon Ho. Go ahead.

992
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,670
This is it.

993
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,570
(Ramyeon is always good.)

994
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,640
This ramyeon...

995
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,010
This is great.

996
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,410
(Smiling)

997
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,310
This is the most clams
I had recently.

998
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,110
This is the most clams I ever had.

999
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,110
Me too.

1000
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,420
Seon Ho, you must still be hungry.

1001
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,180
I don't feel full at all.

1002
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,890
You're still hungry
after eating all this food?

1003
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,690
You must spend
a lot of money on food.

1004
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,120
I spend all my living expenses
on food.

1005
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,660
- Everyone, did you enjoy your food?
- Yes.

1006
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,430
Let's move on to the next location
for digestion.

1007
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,300
- The next hardcore schedule?
- Yes.

1008
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,970
One, two, three.

1009
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,270
I'm sorry, but can we exchange
4kg of clams...

1010
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,340
with some Coke?

1011
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,410
(We thought their lunch was over.)

1012
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,240
(Seon Ho stays behind
and keeps eating alone.)

1013
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,680
(Looking around carefully)

1014
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,180
It's a little embarrassing.

1015
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,550
I'll stop after eating this.

1016
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,020
(I still want to eat some more.)

1017
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,260
(Seon Ho finished
the remaining clams by himself.)

1018
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,520
I'm done eating.

1019
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,190
(Now he's satisfied.)

1020
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,930
- Hello.
- You lost so much weight.

1021
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,430
Hello. Hi.

1022
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,000
- They're from 2 Days and 1 Night.
- Thank you.

1023
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,700
I'm so full.

1024
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,900
(They set out to the next location.)

1025
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,500
(Glancing)

1026
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,110
Can they see us or not?

1027
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,210
(Hi)

1028
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,380
They're so adorable.

1029
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,640
(Young female fans wave to the bus.)

1030
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,680
They're so cute.

1031
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,480
(The two uncles wave back
with excitement.)

1032
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,150
- I think they see us.
- Should I get close to the window?

1033
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,920
Do they see us?

1034
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,590
(The fans wave
until the bus leaves.)

1035
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,890
Soon, it will be a year...

1036
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:09,160
since Sae Ho and Joon
joined the show.

1037
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,530
It's already been a year?

1038
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,230
(On the rooftop
of KBS' main building)

1039
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,160
(They brought a whirlwind
to 2 Days and 1 Night.)

1040
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,300
(Sae Ho and Joon joined the show.)

1041
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,440
Time flies extremely fast.

1042
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,110
- I know.
- Has it already been a year?

1043
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,780
When you joined 2 Days and 1 Night,

1044
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,040
you didn't imagine
that we'd get this close, did you?

1045
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,710
Honestly,

1046
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,080
I joined the show hoping
that I'd get this close to you.

1047
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,120
(Slightly moved)

1048
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,920
- Really?
- I'll be honest.

1049
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,020
Before joining every show,

1050
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,190
I always wonder if I'll enjoy it
and make it fun.

1051
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,290
I thought that I'd have a lot of fun
with members like you.

1052
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,130
I also wanted to get to
know you better.

1053
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,430
(Sae Ho expected it to be
an enjoyable journey.)

1054
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,900
So I was very curious to find out
the other new member.

1055
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,500
- You didn't know Joon then?
- I didn't know him at all.

1056
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Jong Hyun asked me,

1057
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,000
"We think that Joon is..."

1058
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,710
"very charming and fun.
What do you think?"

1059
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,510
I also said,
"Joon is very charming and fun."

1060
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,610
- I agreed.
- They had to work a lot...

1061
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,110
to persuade Joon.

1062
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,180
- Really?
- After hearing about you joining.

1063
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,250
- What?
- Joon...

1064
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,920
We'll talk about it later.
Right, Joon?

1065
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,090
Tell me.

1066
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,890
It's all in the past.

1067
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,460
What were your honest thoughts?

1068
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,930
When you heard
that I was joining the show.

1069
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,660
I didn't know until the last moment.

1070
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,030
You didn't know who Cho Sae Ho was?

1071
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,130
(Laughing)

1072
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,200
He might've remembered me...

1073
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,300
- as Yangbaechu.
- That's true.

1074
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,730
I didn't know
you were joining the show.

1075
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,770
I found out through an article.

1076
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,770
- In the article...
- There was an article about it.

1077
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,470
Tell me honestly.
Were you interested in me...

1078
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,670
at least a little?

1079
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,840
- Of course.
- What?

1080
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,080
I knew you from "Tazzang."
People of my generation know you.

1081
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,210
Have you ever wanted to meet me?

1082
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,450
I don't think he admired you.

1083
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,450
I'm just asking.

1084
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,380
You were just someone
I knew the face of.

1085
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,920
- Someone you knew the face of?
- I mean...

1086
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,390
(He just knew him from "Tazzang"
before 2 Days and 1 Night.)

1087
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,120
(Now, they're colleagues who joined
the show at the same time.)

1088
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,490
For the first anniversary...

1089
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,360
- of Joon and Sae Ho...
- What do they want to do?

1090
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,730
- Yes.
- Joon, is there something you want?

1091
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,030
I want to do something hardcore.

1092
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,230
There he goes again.

1093
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,930
He's talking nonsense again.

1094
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,070
Joon, just go to sleep.

1095
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,740
How about this?

1096
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,240
Among the things
we've done so far...

1097
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,240
Among the things we've done
without them,

1098
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,110
there are really tough activities.

1099
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,210
Those are
what they should experience.

1100
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,810
- After that experience,
- We should do them together.

1101
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,950
they'll become real members.

1102
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,150
Then are we fake members now?

1103
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,490
I took two and a half years
to become the real member.

1104
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,550
Why did it take so long?

1105
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,920
They haven't done anything
on a mudflat, have they?

1106
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,020
We've been to mudflats.

1107
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,660
We did a lot there.

1108
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,030
(Sae Ho worked hard.)

1109
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,360
Sae Ho, have you done
a parachute jump?

1110
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,630
- No, I haven't.
- From a cliff?

1111
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,100
You just jump off from a cliff.

1112
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,130
I jumped out of a plane
at 2,000m in altitude.

1113
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,500
That's true.

1114
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,640
Why don't Director Cho
and Director Lee come up...

1115
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,670
with a new theme and go on a trip?

1116
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,010
- That could be fun.
- With many activities.

1117
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,080
It'd be a lot of fun.

1118
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,150
The two of you should plan it
without us.

1119
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,950
We'll come without knowing anything.

1120
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,550
Will you get angry or not?
You'd better not get annoyed.

1121
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,650
Are you sure that
you won't hold it against me?

1122
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,150
- Hold it against you?
- Yes.

1123
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,190
- We'll do it together anyway.
- Yes.

1124
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,090
- You wouldn't choose something...
- Right.

1125
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,190
that'd be hard for you.

1126
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,390
But I think Joon will do so.

1127
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,090
I'm worried about Joon too.

1128
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,660
I think it'd be fun
if the other members...

1129
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,470
- Yes.
- chose 1 of the 2 teams...

1130
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,700
which are Team Director Cho
and Team Director Lee.

1131
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,500
- That sounds fun.
- That would be fun, right?

1132
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,910
(Director Lee likes
hardcore missions.)

1133
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,270
If no one chooses to join
Team Director Lee,

1134
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,040
Director Lee will have
to do everything by himself.

1135
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,080
So it'll be 5 against 1.

1136
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,480
I already have a few ideas.

1137
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,610
Can you give us an example?

1138
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,780
I came up with three ideas,
and they're all simple.

1139
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,780
Tell us.

1140
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,820
We start
at the head of the Han River.

1141
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,790
- We get an inflatable boat...
- Okay.

1142
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,860
and row the boat to our destination.

1143
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,090
And we have to catch fish
to get food to eat.

1144
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,560
And we row the boat along the river
until we meet the ocean.

1145
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,700
(He's already tired.)

1146
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,800
There's one condition.
No one must leave the boat.

1147
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
(They don't know how to react.)

1148
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,000
Even comic books I read as a kid
were not that ridiculous.

1149
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,700
- That's one of the ideas.
- Yes.

1150
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,270
And I have told you
about this one before.

1151
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,440
Traveling to another country
by a duck boat.

1152
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,510
- What did you say?
- When we arrive...

1153
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,680
If we go to another country
by a duck boat,

1154
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,010
we'll get caught in the strait.

1155
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,110
We need to arrange things
to make that work.

1156
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:55,320
Then it'll be solved.
And the third one is...

1157
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,250
Across the country... I mean,
that's the purpose of our show.

1158
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,490
- Yes.
- As a special event,

1159
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,890
we ride tricycles for children...

1160
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,590
from one area to the adjacent area.

1161
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,330
Through the journey,
we can test our limits.

1162
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:10,000
- Let me share my ideas with you.
- Okay.

1163
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,370
Since we can't go to Paris,

1164
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,470
we adjust our everyday schedule
to the time zone of Paris instead.

1165
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,770
- To Paris' time zone.
- Wait.

1166
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,370
Doesn't it sound fun?

1167
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,040
- Sae Ho, that sounds fun.
- According to Paris' local time.

1168
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,380
- For instance, we throw a dice.
- Yes.

1169
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,050
- And we get Paris.
- Right.

1170
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,180
- It's evening in Paris now.
- Exactly.

1171
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,520
- So we have dinner in the morning.
- That's right.

1172
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,020
And then we roll the dice again.

1173
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,820
This time, we get New York.

1174
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,490
- We should go to bed.
- It's bedtime there. So we sleep.

1175
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,160
- Then we roll the dice again.
- That's right.

1176
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,930
This time, we get a place
where it's 6 a.m.

1177
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,500
- So we wake up and drink coffee.
- Right.

1178
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,560
That would be fun.

1179
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,030
- What do you think?
- I think it's a good idea.

1180
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,170
I'll develop this idea...

1181
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,770
- I do like this one.
- into a detailed plan.

1182
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,200
(Satisfied)

1183
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,900
Do not complain even if you keep
getting places where it's morning.

1184
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,910
- Of course, we won't.
- We won't.

1185
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,540
But we get to sleep all day long
if it's night in the places we get.

1186
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,710
I just thought about it
on a deeper level.

1187
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,550
It could be a nightmare.

1188
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,850
We'll have a great time
if we get lucky.

1189
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,520
It relies entirely on luck.

1190
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,420
(They keep going
with happy thoughts.)

1191
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,890
- Where are we? Is this a park?
- What is this place?

1192
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,690
- Is that a river?
- We'll go into a river this time.

1193
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,860
Water again?

1194
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,760
I don't have spare underwear.
What should I do?

1195
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,100
- I guess we'll go into the water.
- I see a boat.

1196
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,700
Maybe we'll do rowing.
What's going on?

1197
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,570
- Oh, gosh. That's really hard.
- Rowing?

1198
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,370
But this place is beautiful.

1199
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,440
It's so beautiful.

1200
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,470
Indeed.

1201
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,710
- This pathway is beautiful.
- Exactly.

1202
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,650
(The yellow flowers and the blue sky
harmonize with each other.)

1203
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,550
- The weather is cool.
- This is nice.

1204
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,550
- Those are really pretty.
- Indeed. There's a lot of them.

1205
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,590
(I can't miss taking photos
of the pretty scenery.)

1206
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:38,850
- Look at those flowers.
- Nice.

1207
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,990

1209
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,520
The background is magnificent.

1210
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:44,890
(You can get the best photo ever
thanks to the background.)

1211
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,300
Oh, nice. That's a good one.

1212
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,600
Sae Ho always makes that face
when he takes a photo.

1213
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,170
(Sae Ho's unique facial expression:
Benevolent smile)

1214
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,230
- You're right.
- Hey, stand here.

1215
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,640
- Guys, can you look at the camera?
- Sorry?

1216
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,740
Can you look at the camera
just once?

1217
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,480
(Sae Ho makes
a benevolent smile again.)

1218
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,810
Okay.

1219
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,310
(Satisfied)

1220
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,550
- I see the photos before sleeping.
- Really?

1221
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,250
Yes. It reminds me of what I've done
and whom I've done it with.

1222
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,020
Are my photos saved
on your phone now?

1223
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,250
Of course. I sort out photos often,
but I still have your photos.

1224
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,120
What kind of game will we play here?
I have no clue.

1225
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,030
- We'll just dive into the water.
- Hello.

1226
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:21,400
I mean,
what's the point of having showered?

1227
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,730
I don't have any extra underwear!

1228
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,730
I really have no extra underwear.
That's why. Believe me.

1229
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,740
It's only 4:30 p.m. now,
and I've showered 3 times.

1230
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,910
My skin is so dry
that it's getting flaky.

1231
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,910
I've almost used up my lotion.

1232
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:33,180
What are we going to do here?

1233
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,980
We held ourselves back
as it's beautiful here. What's this?

1234
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,020
This is the Baekma River
which means the biggest river...

1235
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,920
- in Baekje.
- The Baekma River?

1236
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,290
- The biggest river in Baekje.
- I see.

1237
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,560
The national dragon boat racing is
held here every year.

1238
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,760
"Dragon boat?"

1239
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:52,560
Since we're here, you can't miss
the chance to ride a dragon boat.

1240
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,700
Hey, Joon. Gosh.

1241
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,230
- It's your fault, Joon.
- You talked about a boat trip.

1242
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,600
But this isn't my fault.

1243
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,170
- Then why did you talk about...
- Does this reflect my opinion?

1244
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,170
That's right.

1245
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:03,240
- Goodness. It really is my fault.
- Of course.

1246
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,470
As if you didn't know
it was your fault.

1247
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:06,310
Don't we usually do one activity
a day?

1248
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,040
We've hang-glided today.
So isn't that it?

1249
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,680
We hang-glided
and swam with swim rings.

1250
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,550
- Now we'll ride a dragon boat too.
- That's correct.

1251
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:13,550
- Oh, okay.
- But...

1252
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,320
Because this is
a real wild road variety show.

1253
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,090
It suits our show.

1254
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,590
(Dumbfounded)

1255
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,160
Flying in the sky
and riding a boat on the river.

1256
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,690
- We're doing all sorts of things.
- Exactly.

1257
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:24,990
We invited some people
who'll teach you how to row a boat.

1258
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,360
Please come.

1259
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,560
Hello.

1260
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,160
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you all.

1261
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,300
- Hello.
- Please help us in many ways.

1262
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,070
We're the winning team of
national dragon boat racing...

1263
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:40,140
of last year hosted
by the Buyeo County Sports Council.

1264
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,480
- Really?
- Yes, we're Team Nam-myeon.

1265
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,350
- Let's go! We've got this!
- We've got this!

1266
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,750
(The winning team is
from Nam-myeon, Buyeo-gun.)

1267
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,550
Look at their arms.
No wonder they won the race.

1268
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,020
- You're the winning team?
- Yes.

1269
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,720
- I think they're all very strong.
- Will they only teach us?

1270
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,620
We won't compete
against the winning team of the race.

1271
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,260
- I'll explain to you later.
- Okay.

1272
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,560
You'll have to try
riding a dragon boat first.

1273
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,860
Are you mentally ready?

1274
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,000
- Yes.
- Should we even get ready mentally?

1275
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,930
Now, you're going to ride
a dragon boat.

1276
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:03,970
(Be friends with a dragon boat.
They'll ride a boat first!)

1277
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,040
- Then we'll learn how to do it.
- Okay.

1278
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,470
- We're doing many activities today.
- Exactly.

1279
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:12,540
I didn't know it'd be this hard
to be on a real wild road variety show.

1280
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,640
Jong Min must be enjoying himself
in Paris right now.

1281
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,680
- Should we get on this boat?
- Oh, this is it.

1282
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,180
- A dragon boat. There's the head.
- Look at the dragon head.

1283
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

1284
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,420
It's nice to meet you.

1285
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,490
(Fascinated)

1286
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,590
(They get on the dragon boat.)

1287
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,400
- I should ride alone, right?
- No, that's okay.

1288
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,400
One of you, get on the boat.

1289
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,800
(He trusts the expert
and carefully gets on the boat.)

1290
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,670
- But the boat is...
- Sit on the right side. Next, here.

1291
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:40,940
Come forward.

1292
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,810
(Leaning)

1293
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,210
(They almost went into the water again.)

1294
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:48,180
I did as I was told.
He said to sit on this side.

1295
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,380
We're moving.
(They all safely got on the boat.)

1296
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,280
We're doing
a lot of different activities today.

1297
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,490
Row when I count to two
and hit the drum, okay?

1298
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:59,120
Let's try it. One, two.

1299
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,590
One, two.

1300
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,030
(They row awkwardly,
and they aren't in sync.)

1301
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,390
One, two.

1302
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:08,030
(This isn't easy.)

1303
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,360
One, two.

1304
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:10,730
(They have to practice a lot
as it's not easy!)

1305
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,130
- Row on the beat.
- Two.

1306
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,240
Row on the beat.

1307
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,970
- One, two.
- The boat is moving well.

1308
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:17,240
One, two.

1309
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,370
- It's moving well.
- One, two.

1310
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,840
It's moving fast.

1311
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,610
(They already got used to rowing.)

1312
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,950
- Are you having fun?
- Yes. It's moving smoothly.

1313
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,780
- It's not bad.
- Right. It's not bad.

1314
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,420
The weather is nice today.
This is nice.

1315
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,950
- Thank you for saying that.
- You're welcome.

1316
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,720
Oh, my. What's that bus?

1317
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,920
- It's an amphibious bus.
- I see.

1318
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:38,860
It can travel
on both land and water.

1319
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,330
- Great. That's amazing.
- Fascinating.

1320
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:41,330
I've never seen it before.

1321
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:42,600
There must be fish in the river.

1322
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,300
- Yes, there are.
- What kinds of fish are there?

1323
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,900
There are native fish
and some other types.

1324
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,710
That was fun.

1325
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,910
(The dragon boat ride is over.)

1326
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,710
How was it? Did you enjoy it?

1327
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,710
Yes, it was fun.

1328
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,380
You flew in the sky
and swam in the sea earlier.

1329
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,650
The game you'll play here
on the Baekma River...

1330
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,020
is 6-on-6 Dragon Boat Tug of War.

1331
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,490
The two teams will sit on the boat
facing each other.

1332
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,990
You have one minute to row,
and the team that moves farther...

1333
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,730
to the other team's side wins.

1334
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:10,890
- So we have to push them.
- But...

1335
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,000
They're athletes,
whereas we've never done this before.

1336
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,370
They've never played
this kind of game before either.

1337
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,830
All right, then.

1338
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:19,740
But we're one player short.

1339
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,570
- You're five without Jong Min now.
- Yes.

1340
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,940
- His place will be filled...
- I think Ji Woong will replace him.

1341
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:27,740
- by Jong Min's cameraman, Ji Woong.
- What? No.

1342
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:31,150
- Instead of him...
- Ji Woong is physically unfit.

1343
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,210
He's been working out lately.

1344
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,020
When we have to run,
he just puts down his camera.

1345
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,420
He would never run.

1346
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,420
(He puts down his camera
once he feels tired.)

1347
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,920
That's not true.
Recently, he started playing golf.

1348
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,520
Does golf not improve
your physical fitness?

1349
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,720
(Ji Woong has been trying to improve
his strength by playing golf?)

1350
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,760
(As soon as it ends,
the tug of war match begins.)

1351
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,130
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

1352
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,730
- Give it a try.
- Let's give it a try.

1353
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:51,770
I mean, we have Se Yoon on our team.

1354
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,170
- Let's give it a try.
- Right. Let's do this.

1355
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:54,540
Do not slack off, okay?

1356
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,370
- Why would we slack off?
- Do your very best for one minute.

1357
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,910
- Of course, I'll do that.
- All right.

1358
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,340
- We should win. I want to win.
- Okay.

1359
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,480
- Ji Woong, sit on the right side.
- Okay. Good.

1360
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,610
All right.

1361
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,710
(Se Yoon and Ji Woong
sit in the front.)

1362
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:07,650
- Sae Ho, sit on the left side.
- Okay.

1363
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,990
We need to row at this speed.
One, two.

1364
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,890
Even if we're losing, stay calm.

1365
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,420
- Because we have 1 minute.
- We have 1 minute.

1366
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,730
One minute isn't so long.
Let's do our best.

1367
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:18,330
- Okay.
- Good. Let's do this.

1368
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,030
We've been working together
for a year. This will work.

1369
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,160
It's hot.

1370
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,100
Ji Woong, do you get nervous
in front of a camera?

1371
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:25,570
Why are you so quiet?

1372
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,500
If you'll keep looking unmotivated,
just leave the boat!

1373
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,600
No.

1374
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,840
- You'll sleep indoors anyway, so...
- It's not like that.

1375
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,980
- Cheer up and be motivated.
- Let's do this.

1376
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,480
You look like we've lost already.

1377
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,080
- Let's go.
- We're moving now.

1378
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,650
Okay. Let's do this.

1379
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,820
Oh, they're pulling the rope
to move the boat.

1380
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,620
They're aligning the center
with the flag here.

1381
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,950
So we'll be rowing
while facing each other.

1382
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,160
Is there a sports game like this?

1383
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,760
- No.
- So this is new to you as well.

1384
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,290
This is our first time
playing this kind of game.

1385
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,160
You just have to keep rowing.
It's simple.

1386
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,260
- Ready, go. And one, two.
- We need to row fast.

1387
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,300
Let's practice
to row at the same time.

1388
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:00,300
One, two. Keep going.
Remember this rhythm.

1389
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,500
- Everyone, are you ready?
- Get ready.

1390
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,340
All right. We'll begin now.

1391
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,680
(The athletes are getting ready
in the disciplined position.)

1392
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,910
- Put your oars in the water now.
- They're already in that position.

1393
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:10,910
- Put the oar in the water.
- Row on two, okay?
- Row on two. Remember.
- Ready!

1394
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:13,950
- I'll count to two and repeat.
- Ready!

1395
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,350
(Will they be able to win...)

1396
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,150
(against the athletes?)

1397
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,520
(The tug of war starts.)

1398
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,690
- One, two.
- One, two.

1399
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:27,930
(Paddling with all their might)

1400
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,660
(Shouting out)

1401
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,500
(Fashion Muscle uses full power.)

1402
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,840
(The athletes are also paddling
without a break.)

1403
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,370
- One, two.
- One, two.

1404
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,870
(The athletes start moving forward.)

1405
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:42,580
(No. Don't let them push us back!)

1406
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,180
(They try their best to hold out.)

1407
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,950
(But the power dynamics
became unbalanced soon.)

1408
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:53,460
- One, two.
- One, two.

1409
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,990
(The balance shifted
only in 30 seconds.)

1410
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:56,890
(2 Days and 1 Night members)

1411
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,000
(They are defeated
on 6-on-6 Dragon Boat Tug of War.)

1412
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,760
- We're done.
- One, two.

1413
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:04,230
Please make your way back.

1414
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,230
We're no match for them.

1415
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,370
I think we were doing well
until the first ten seconds.

1416
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,870
I saw the flag on my right.

1417
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,910
We were neck and neck
in the beginning.

1418
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,480
But you lost all your power
toward the end.

1419
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,780
Gosh, they're good.

1420
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,010
A battle that ended with only scars.

1421
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,610
- Well done, everyone.
- Right.

1422
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:19,680
We're no match for them.

1423
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,080
To make it fair,

1424
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,690
let's do another round...

1425
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,090
- with the four players from here.
- That sounds fair enough.

1426
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:29,020
I'm not sure if we can beat them.
But we can play one more round.

1427
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,760
Okay, let's do one more round.

1428
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,800
Let's do another round
with the four players from here.

1429
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,000
- Okay.
- How about 40 seconds?

1430
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,470
- Okay. Single round, 40 seconds.
- Is 40 seconds okay?

1431
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,000
- Make it 30 seconds.
- Okay, 30 seconds?

1432
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,270
- Tough fight for 30 seconds.
- Okay, that sounds fair.

1433
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,870
We'll just do our best
to endure 30 seconds.

1434
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:45,370
Doesn't it mean that we win
if we stay in the middle...

1435
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,680
of the river after
a vigorous 30-second round?

1436
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,880
(Dumbfounded)

1437
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,880
- Okay.
- Right.

1438
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,950
- If it's a tie, we still win.
- Okay.

1439
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,050
- He agreed.
- Let's do that.

1440
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:55,220
- Let's go for another round.
- Okay.

1441
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,690
Let's go!

1442
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:57,850
We'll win this time.

1443
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,720
- We have to win this time.
- We'll win.

1444
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,520
We can't lose this round.

1445
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,620
One, two, three.

1446
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,230
- Let's go, Buyeo!
- Let's go!

1447
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,790
- What about us?
- Buyeo!

1448
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,560
(Taking the initiative
with their cheers)

1449
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,730
(Let's show us our energy too.)

1450
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,330
- 2 Days...
- Let's go!

1451
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,870
- Ji Woong should shout first.
- Okay.

1452
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,270
On the count of three.

1453
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:14,600
- Ready, go.
- 2 Days...

1454
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,640
- Let's go!
- And 1 Night!

1455
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,670
- That wasn't right.
- We'll win!

1456
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,970
We're shouting the name of the show?
Okay.

1457
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,010
- Okay, let's do it once more.
- 2 Days...

1458
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,010
- And 1 Night.
- And 1 Night.

1459
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,280
Let's start, everyone.

1460
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,820
- Let's go.
- Get ready.

1461
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,380
Put your paddles
before your left hands.

1462
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,190
Start rowing when he says, "Start."

1463
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,020
- Get ready.
- Ready?

1464
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,090
(Can they beat
the 4 players this time?)

1465
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,220
Set...

1466
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:39,630
- Let's go!
- Go!

1467
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,760
- Let's go!
- Go!

1468
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,430
(Neck and neck)

1469
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:48,470
(It looks like it's a close game
when it's 4 versus 6.)

1470
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,810
(We're going to win this time.)

1471
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:55,310
- Go!
- Go!

1472
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,550
(Paddling with all their energy)

1473
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,720
(Suffering)

1474
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:10,260
(Even the pro team is paddling
with all their might.)

1475
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:14,100
- Go!
- Go!

1476
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,030
(At that moment,
the members push forward.)

1477
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,530
- We're moving forward!
- Go!

1478
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,900
(All right, let's go!)

1479
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,470
- Let's go!
- Go!

1480
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:24,740
(Paddling like crazy)

1481
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,410
(They keep moving forward.)

1482
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:29,710
(Flustered)

1483
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:33,380
(Paddling forward with momentum)

1484
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,650
We're winning!

1485
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,250
(Victory is right in front of them.)

1486
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,420
We're winning!

1487
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,290
(He's reached his limit.)

1488
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,290
(Game over)

1489
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:47,030
(The members won.)

1490
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,130
We won.

1491
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,430
- We won.
- Unbelievable.

1492
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:51,470
(We did it!)

1493
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,700
We won!

1494
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:55,070
They worked well together
after playing it once.

1495
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,070
Everyone, good job.

1496
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,940
I'll announce the result
when you return.

1497
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:02,780
For the first ten seconds,
their boat didn't move at all.

1498
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,010
Gosh, they're amazing.

1499
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:05,050
(They also played well
with just 4 players.)

1500
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,310
It was just four of them.

1501
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,520
Gosh, thank you.

1502
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,450
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1503
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:10,690
Well done.

1504
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,220
Everyone, good job.

1505
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,990
We'll let the players go now.

1506
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:17,030
Then we'll talk about
how you can acquire the items.

1507
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:18,690
When is your next match?

1508
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:21,460
It's later this year, on October 25.

1509
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,800
- Let's cheer for them.
- Okay.

1510
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,030
We'll cheer when you shout out
the name of your team.

1511
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,800
- Good job, today.
- Team Buyeo!

1512
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,300
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1513
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,940
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1514
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,270
- Thank you.
- We learned a lot from you.

1515
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,870
- Thank you.
- Everyone.

1516
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,440
- You won...
- Okay.

1517
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,740
the second round.

1518
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,510
So does that mean
we can choose two items?

1519
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,650
- Yes.
- It'll be all set...

1520
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,810
with the camp bed
and the air mattress.

1521
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,450
A tarp would also be nice.

1522
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,220
We don't need it
for the wooden bench.

1523
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,450
But not all of us can fit.

1524
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,620
That's what I'm saying.
One can sleep on the air mattress.

1525
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,320
One can sleep on the camp bed.

1526
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,590
Three of us can sleep on the bench.

1527
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,790
- That's five of us.
- Right.

1528
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,830
We have a place to lie down.

1529
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,530
Let's pick those two items
and decide who gets what.

1530
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,730
We'll pick the camp bed
and the air mattress.

1531
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,670
Yes, air mattress. Do you all agree?

1532
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,100
- Yes.
- I agree.

1533
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,000
Let's pick the air mattress
and the camp bed.

1534
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,940
- Okay.
- You got your items now.

1535
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,310
We'll now move to the base camp.

1536
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:08,780
We have a base camp too?

1537
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,650
- We have this space.
- I see.

1538
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:11,650
All right, let's go.

1539
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:13,080
- Let's go.
- Let's get going.

1540
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,380
- Let's go.
- Gosh, today,

1541
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:17,490
we got on a hang-glider
and a boat too.

1542
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:21,390
(A short break
after grueling schedule)

1543
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:24,290
My song will be released on July 3.

1544
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,290
Really?

1545
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,830
My music video's scheduled for next week.
Seon Ho will be in it.

1546
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,200
(Seon Ho was chosen
as the main character of the music video.)

1547
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,370
Seon Ho said he would take part.

1548
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,230
You know what he said
over the phone at first?

1549
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,800
"Seon Ho, let me be honest."

1550
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,640
"I asked Joon. But he said no."

1551
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,310
(I asked Joon, but he said no.)

1552
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:38,510
"Can you do this for me?"

1553
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,110
Let's hear what Joon has to say.
Why did you say no?

1554
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:43,680
- He's in a musical, that's why.
- I'm not available.

1555
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:44,880
I told him straight up.

1556
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,950
"Hey, Joon said no.
He can't do it for me."

1557
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:48,650
"Can you do this for me?"

1558
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,120
"You can say no. We can just eat
or something."

1559
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,120
Of course.

1560
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,350
He was really honest.

1561
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,020
(Please send support for Se Yoon
and Seon Ho's work.)

1562
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,190
I feel like I'm still flying
in the sky.

1563
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,760
That just hit me for a second.

1564
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,760
(It has been really dynamic
the whole day.)

1565
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,230
When the guy said,
"That's Anmyeondo Island."

1566
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,470
I was shocked.

1567
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:04,630
(He can't forget
the taste of flying.)

1568
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:08,200
(He also screamed
his lungs out loud.)

1569
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,670
Are we giving all the items
to one person?

1570
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,810
We have a camp bed
and an air mattress.

1571
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:15,180
But Se Yoon needs
his sleeping bag...

1572
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,910
when he sleeps on the wooden bench.

1573
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:18,850
Let's give the sleeping bag
to Se Yoon...

1574
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:20,150
- and the wooden bench.
- Okay.

1575
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,950
Let's give the other sleeping bag...

1576
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,720
to the one who gets the air mat
or the camp bed.

1577
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,020
- Okay.
- The others sleep with nothing.

1578
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,520
Two of you can sleep
in one sleeping bag.

1579
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,890
One of you can sleep
with newspapers or something.

1580
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,860
We'll get a lot of mosquito bites.

1581
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:35,430
One sleeping bag each
for those who sleep...

1582
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,930
on the camp bed
and the air mattress.

1583
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,240
Three people sleep with nothing
on the wooden bench.

1584
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,670
That sounds tough.

1585
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:44,670
(We can't figure it out.)

1586
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,840
But this is what I think.

1587
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,840
When three people sleep together
on the bench,

1588
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,910
the one in the middle
will suffer a lot.

1589
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,350
- Rock-paper-scissors, then.
- Right, rock-paper-scissors.

1590
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:54,150
If it's too small,

1591
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:55,220
the one who sleeps on the edge
might fall off.

1592
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,790
- Se Yoon will fall for sure.
- I'll fall for sure.

1593
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,020
I sleep with my back crouched.

1594
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,790
It's just one night.
Let's just see how it goes.

1595
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,120
- We'll think about it there.
- Let's face it later.

1596
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,890
Let's decide everything...

1597
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:05,530
when we see the sizes...

1598
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,160
of the air mattress, camp bed,
and the wooden bench.

1599
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,470
Let's check the weather for tonight.

1600
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:11,570
(Leaving their concerns behind)

1601
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,330
(They've arrived at the base camp.)

1602
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,470
(This is
where they're sleeping tonight.)

1603
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:19,210
What's that? "Problem Child
in House" is treating?

1604
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:20,580
(He sees a coffee truck
outside the window.)

1605
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,640
Gosh, what is this?

1606
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,880
- Let's have it.
- Hello.

1607
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,210
- Hello.
- Hello.

1608
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,050
Why is "Problem Child in House"
treating us coffee?

1609
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:27,650
Jong Min must have won.

1610
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:28,880
- He won the game?
- That must be the case.

1611
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,590
It looks so good.

1612
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,720
Let's take a photo here
and send it to Jong Min.

1613
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,560
- Sure, let's do that.
- Let's take photos.

1614
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,990
(Gathering)

1615
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,930
One, two, three.

1616
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,090
(Thank you, Jong Min.)

1617
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,260
(Team "Problem Child in House"
is the best.)

1618
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,460
Can we drink this?

1619
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,400
I think we have to drink this.

1620
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,470
Jong Min treated us this.

1621
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,370
You can take a look first
as you will drink after playing games.

1622
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:52,640
- We can just look at it.
- What do you have?

1623
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,510
That's the menu down there.

1624
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,480
You can fill out the order form.

1625
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,010
We can't have it now.

1626
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,220
Let's play games first.
Our stuff is over there.

1627
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,480
Let's get our stuff.

1628
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,650
- We'll be back.
- Okay.

1629
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,790
It's DinDin's.
Do you want me to carry it?

1630
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:07,890
DinDin, it's yours.

1631
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:09,390
(Everyone is taking their stuff.)

1632
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:10,830
It's Joon's. Let's go.

1633
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:12,530
- Let's go for now.
- Okay.

1634
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,730
What's with the grass? Goodness.

1635
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,400
Gosh, it's nice here.

1636
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,500
The ground isn't so bad.

1637
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,730
It's so pretty here.

1638
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,100
This grass.

1639
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,640
The bench is quite big.

1640
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,110
Yes, it's big.

1641
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,510
But it's short.

1642
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,410
- Three people have to sleep on it.
- It has to be three.

1643
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:28,610
Four people can't sleep there.
Their legs won't fit.

1644
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,250
- Right, it's for three people.
- Yes.

1645
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,580
All right. This place is called...

1646
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:35,620
Bangyo Village where there's
a beautiful stone wall trail.

1647
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:38,850
- Bangyo Village.
- So the village allowed us...

1648
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,890
to stay here for the night.
It's where you go bivouac.

1649
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,630
- It's better than I thought.
- Right, it's so nice.

1650
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:44,890
The grass is much better
than I thought.

1651
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:46,490
It's much better
than what we thought.

1652
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,800
A lot of grass means many bugs.

1653
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,670
- Right.
- I see about 50 bugs already.

1654
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:55,200
You can see there's a lot of bugs
just by looking. What do we do?

1655
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,310
You have to sleep here tonight.

1656
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:59,940
Do you see the grocery store there?

1657
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,880
Turn right
and go straight from there.

1658
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,340
There's a public bathroom.

1659
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,810
- We have to go out to use it?
- That's right.

1660
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:06,950
- Really?
- Yes.

1661
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,880
- Okay.
- We can't shower tonight?

1662
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,620
I was just going to tell you.

1663
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:14,920
There's a faucet over there
next to the blue bowl.

1664
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,930
So we just wash there.

1665
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:18,590
- We can wash our backs there?
- Right.

1666
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:21,360
You also have
a temporary dressing room.

1667
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,260
- Is that why...
- We'll give you the box.

1668
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,000
(I see...)

1669
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,500
Can't we use it as a blanket?

1670
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,770
- You can.
- Since you gave it to us.

1671
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:30,810
- Is that for us?
- Yes, it's for you.

1672
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:33,270
That's amazing.
I can even sleep on top of this.

1673
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,180
I can use it as a sleeping bag.

1674
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,610
- Sure.
- Shall we unfold the camp bed?

1675
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,480
There must be a key. That's it.

1676
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,580
(Setting up their sleeping spot)

1677
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,920
- Just put it down.
- We can just put it down.

1678
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:47,620
(Filling air for the air mattress)

1679
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,460
I'm so cold. Can I get changed?

1680
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,260
- Go ahead.
- You can get changed here.

1681
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,560
My clothes are all wet.

1682
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,730
You want me to set up
a dressing room?

1683
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:55,730
Come here.

1684
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,270
(Setting up a dressing room)

1685
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,300
Joon, let's tear this part.

1686
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,470
We don't have any entrance.

1687
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,440
- Okay.
- Okay.

1688
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,170
You can get changed here.
You can't see, can you?

1689
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,980
- No.
- Seon Ho, get in.

1690
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:09,640
You can't see it here.

1691
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,010
But the camera is filming,
so what's the point?

1692
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:14,380
We can't see anything at all.

1693
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,220
(Getting in)

1694
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,820
I can see all the cameras.

1695
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,520
- It's just you.
- Really?

1696
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,520
- We can see you if we do this.
- What are you doing?

1697
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,530
- There is no camera.
- There's one over there.

1698
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:26,960
(It's not easy to bivouac.)

1699
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,030
We can't see anything.

1700
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:31,030
(The air mattress
is filled with air.)

1701
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,600
You can blow it more
until it gets really hard.

1702
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,040
Right, it has to be hard.

1703
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:37,740
(Everyone worked together...)

1704
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,940
(to complete the bivouac base camp.)

1705
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:40,980
Try lying down.

1706
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,510
Should we fill more air?

1707
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,580
(It perfectly fits him.)

1708
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,110
- Should we fill in more air?
- Are your front teeth out?

1709
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,120
It's perfect.

1710
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,520
Goodness, it's nice.

1711
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,750
Let me see
if this can hold my weight.

1712
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,790
It's really nice.

1713
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,220
Goodness.

1714
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,790
(His feet are sticking out.)

1715
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:57,360
But I think only DinDin and I
should use this.

1716
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,490
- The size.
- Yes, because of the size.

1717
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,360
I'm small too.

1718
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,900
- Try it.
- It would be perfect for me.

1719
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,800
- It would be perfect for me.
- It's perfect.

1720
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,170
- It's perfect.
- Your legs are sticking out.

1721
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,740
They're not.

1722
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,570
(I should Iie down too.)

1723
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:10,640
Darn it.

1724
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,170
(Kicking)

1725
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,210
Darn it.

1726
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:15,980
Who was that?

1727
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,080
It was funny.

1728
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:20,450
It was painful.

1729
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:22,650
- It's a bed.
- This is it.

1730
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:23,750
- Right?
- It's just a bed.

1731
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:26,020
- This is the best.
- This is the best.

1732
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,360
- It's practically a bed.
- First and second.

1733
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,660
The wooden bench
is all right as well.

1734
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,830
- It fits three people.
- Yes. It's enough.

1735
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:32,230
This is nice.

1736
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,630
It's such a good day.

1737
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,600
Do we just rest like this?

1738
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:36,960
Guys, did you all see...

1739
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,330
- the coffee truck on your way?
- Yes.

1740
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:41,940
Jong Min earned a coffee truck...

1741
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,010
- from "Problem Child in House."
- Okay.

1742
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:46,870
They sent it
to the production team...

1743
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,080
of 2 Days and 1 Night.

1744
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,180
We wondered if we should share it...

1745
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,850
with the members as well.

1746
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:54,020
We asked Jong Min.

1747
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:57,020
- He'd tell you to share, of course.
- It wouldn't have been nice.

1748
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:59,190
He even got married. No way.

1749
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,420
I sent him a message,
and he sent me a video.

1750
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,560
(Kim Jong Min)

1751
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:06,790
I want to give it to everyone...

1752
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,360
He took the video
in front of a chroma key background.

1753
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,800
This is not real.

1754
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,630
He looks like
he is on 2 Days and 1 Night.

1755
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,070
- Where is this?
- It's amazing.

1756
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:17,110
- It's like an energy drink commercial.
- That's what he's doing now.

1757
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,140
Let's watch.

1758
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:20,310
I want to give it to everyone,

1759
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,680
but I guess you could give it
to about three of them.

1760
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,480
You could play a simple game
and give it to three of them.

1761
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:30,020
So we prepared a game...

1762
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,790
to select the three.

1763
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,020
Let's put it in.

1764
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,360
It's really simple.

1765
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,560
What's that?

1766
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:36,690
What's that?

1767
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,360
- That's...
- Is that okay?

1768
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,730
There's a cup inside.

1769
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:41,530
- Water again?
- It's this one.

1770
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,800
- This is a fun game.
- Water again?

1771
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,070
We named it Gurgle Shooting.

1772
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:49,540
You drop a dice above the water.

1773
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,310
When it goes inside the cup,

1774
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,010
- You pass.
- that person will pass.

1775
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,180
(They'll win if the dice
enters the cup in the water.)

1776
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:57,980
It was suggested by Sae Ho
who sends us many game ideas.

1777
01:02:58,580 --> 01:02:59,810
You tried this at home, right?

1778
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,480
- How do you try this at home?
- You tried it.

1779
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,980
You practiced it.

1780
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,120
How do you do this at home?

1781
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,620
He went to a swimming pool
in Bali...

1782
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,360
- to do this.
- That's not true.

1783
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,620
- Why do you do that?
- I thought it would be fun,

1784
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,230
- so I sent it to them before.
- In Bali.

1785
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,860
You'll take turns,

1786
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,860
and the first three to succeed...

1787
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,100
will get a drink.

1788
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,030
This game should be for a meal.

1789
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:20,430
Decide the order well.

1790
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,840
I really want to get this.

1791
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,540
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1792
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,340
- This is for the order.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1793
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:27,510
(Order for Gurgle Shooting)

1794
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,580
(1. Se Yoon, 2. DinDin, 3. Sae Ho
4. Seon Ho, 5. Joon)

1795
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,410
- This doesn't go in?
- Joon.

1796
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,110
I think it will go in easily.

1797
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,150
Go on. You'll get a drink
if it goes in.

1798
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:37,150
- I think I can just put it in.
- Go ahead.

1799
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:38,820
- He's going.
- I'll go.

1800
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:40,490
(Aiming carefully)

1801
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:41,490
(Laughing)

1802
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:42,520
This...

1803
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,030
- I'll do it.
- I think it will just go in.

1804
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,200
(It's heading toward the cup.)

1805
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,030
(Keep going like that.)

1806
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,070
(Turning away)

1807
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,170
It's annoying!

1808
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,210
It's annoying! What is this?

1809
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,640
- Okay. I got it.
- It's annoying.

1810
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,840
It's right here.
It turns right from here.

1811
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,140
I'll give it a go. I'm going.

1812
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:05,280
(He plans to drop it
right next to the cup.)

1813
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:08,120
(It heads toward the cup.)

1814
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,150
(Will it go in?)

1815
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:13,290
(It takes a sharp turn.)

1816
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,720
It doesn't work at all.

1817
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:18,030
- What? It doesn't work at all.
- It doesn't work at all.

1818
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:19,890
I'll go!

1819
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,400
- This is fun.
- Why doesn't it work?

1820
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,460
- It looks difficult.
- I...

1821
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:24,030
- If it goes in...
- What?

1822
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,070
- He touched the water on purpose.
- All right.

1823
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,570
It touched the water. It's over.

1824
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,000
- Is that allowed?
- No.

1825
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,570
- It touched the water.
- It touched the water.

1826
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:31,910
- I didn't do it.
- Come on.

1827
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,440
- It's over.
- No.

1828
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,540
- Next person.
- No.

1829
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,910
- It's done if it touches the water.
- Go later.

1830
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,210
- It's done if it touches the water.
- Wipe your hands.

1831
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,550
- Quickly wipe your hands.
- Okay.

1832
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,820
Wipe it well. It touched the water.

1833
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,780
- It could influence it.
- If this goes in,

1834
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,020
- No.
- that means you went to Bali...

1835
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:46,350
- to train.
- It wasn't a training.

1836
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,290
(Being careful so his hand
doesn't touch the water)

1837
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:50,360
Your hand shouldn't touch it.

1838
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,090
(It quickly goes toward the cup.)

1839
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:53,160
Okay!

1840
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,800
(Sadly, it lands behind the cup.)

1841
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,230
Okay!

1842
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,640
- It's hard.
- It doesn't work.

1843
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,670
- It's hard.
- Why is this hard?

1844
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,170
(Seon Ho goes for it.)

1845
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,080
I think it will go in.

1846
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,410
(Will it go in right away?)

1847
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,380
(Success)

1848
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,620
(It hit the cup and went inside.)

1849
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:22,590
(Seon Ho obtained
the coffee truck drink.)

1850
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,790
Let's go!

1851
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:25,860
It's totally wrong.

1852
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:28,530
(It didn't even get near the cup.)

1853
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:29,960
- Goodness.
- All right.

1854
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,570
- This is the 2nd round.
- The 2nd one.

1855
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:34,800
Are you going to do this for days?
You should just do it at once.

1856
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,210
- It's out.
- Can I...

1857
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,640
Can I give you a tip?

1858
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,980
- I got it.
- You got it?

1859
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,410
- You have to place it softly.
- That's right.

1860
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:44,450
- From above.
- Really?

1861
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:46,950
You shouldn't make a splash.
You should let it go like this.

1862
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,250
- You should place it softly.
- Softly? How?

1863
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,420
You have to watch it from outside.

1864
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:52,620
(He drops it softly.)

1865
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:56,990
Really?

1866
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:00,960
(It really reached the cup!)

1867
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:03,400
Okay!

1868
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:06,700
Good. Okay!

1869
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,600
- Good.
- Can I just try one more time?

1870
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,900
- No, you can't. Move aside.
- No?

1871
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:10,940
- Move aside.
- Why is this...

1872
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,070
We're serious right now.

1873
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:16,580
(His facial muscles
look very serious.)

1874
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,580
It's over when it touches the water.

1875
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:20,310
What's with your hat?

1876
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,650
I'll go.

1877
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,320
- It's over when it touches.
- Okay.

1878
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:27,220
- This is over.
- It's over when it touches.

1879
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:28,690
This is hard.

1880
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:30,860
(Joon goes for it.)

1881
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,760
- This is so hard.
- It's over when it touches.

1882
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,660
(He remains calm and focused.)

1883
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,970
- Just put it in.
- It touched the water. It's over.

1884
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:43,470
(Joon's dice hit the cup as well!)

1885
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,840
(It enters the cup straight.)

1886
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,010
(He just dropped it softly
like Seon Ho said.)

1887
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,050
(Success)

1888
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:53,710
(Bring me the coffee truck drink.)

1889
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:54,980
(Screaming)

1890
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,290
(If it ends up like this...)

1891
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,960
(Joon and Seon Ho
obtained the coffee truck drink.)

1892
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,360
This is hard.

1893
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,130
- It's over once it touches.
- I'm good.

1894
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:07,930
(Only 1 of the 3 can get a drink.)

1895
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,730
(It's back to Se Yoon again.)

1896
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:12,630
Se Yoon. You have to drop it gently.

1897
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:14,870
- He got the hang of it.
- It shouldn't make a splash.

1898
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,900
(Did he really get the hang of it?)

1899
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,840
(The dice left Se Yoon's hand.)

1900
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:23,410
(Where is the dice of fate headed?)

1901
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:25,910
- It touched...
- I don't think so.

1902
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:29,020
(Please fail, my friend.)

1903
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:32,550
It touched...

1904
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,520
(It enters the cup.)

1905
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,690
(Even from the side,)

1906
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:39,390
(It's a perfect goal-in.)

1907
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:41,200
- Okay!
- Okay!

1908
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,960
- Let's go!
- Okay.

1909
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:45,130
- Green grape drink.
- Yes.

1910
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,730
- Okay.
- That's all.

1911
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:48,200
Green grape drink.

1912
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,300
Okay.

1913
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,410
- How do you do this?
- You drop it from here.

1914
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:54,010
You drop it from here.

1915
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:57,480
(I almost succeeded.)

1916
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,150
You should have done well earlier.

1917
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:00,820
What use is that?

1918
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,750
- Keep trying. Let's go and drink.
- Okay.

1919
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,220
- Let's get some drinks.
- Good luck.

1920
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:07,320
- Let's go.
- We'll get going. Let's go.

1921
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,390
Why did you suggest a weird game?

1922
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,930
- But it's fun, right?
- It's fun.

1923
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,660
Where do you get such games?

1924
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,760
Since I keep watching
game-related videos,

1925
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,800
I only get such videos
on my algorithm.

1926
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:22,770
(The three people who succeeded
are happily deciding their option.)

1927
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:24,370
Do we get one drink only?

1928
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:25,940
Yes.

1929
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:28,980
I'll get the green grape drink.

1930
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:31,550
I'll get the green grape drink.

1931
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,950
Shouldn't you drink a latte?
It has milk, so it's filling.

1932
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:36,680
You can't drink coffee?

1933
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,820
(They don't choose
their drinks carelessly.)

1934
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:39,390
I'll get a cafe latte.

1935
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:41,690
- A latte?
- Yes, please make it sweet.

1936
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:43,420
- Okay.
- I'll take a sweet latte.

1937
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,330
Would you like some hazelnut syrup?

1938
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:46,930
That would be tasty.

1939
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:49,460
The green grape drinks are ready.

1940
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,900
- Mix it well.
- Okay. Thank you.

1941
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,600
Let's just drink it up.
They'll ask for some if we take it.

1942
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,670
Okay.

1943
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,240
(He mixes it well.)

1944
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,840
I almost didn't make it.

1945
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:01,010
I wouldn't have won
if I wasn't the first.

1946
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,310
- This is nice.
- Yes.

1947
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,450
It's satisfying.

1948
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:15,160
(Let's just drink it up.
They'll ask for some if we take it.)

1949
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,930
(He is a man of his word.)

1950
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,760
(Sipping like crazy)

1951
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,600
(Sae Ho drinks water.)

1952
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,800
Thankfully,

1953
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,140
the "Problem Child in House" team
sent us a coffee truck.

1954
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,440
But DinDin and I couldn't drink...

1955
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,610
because Jong Min told us
that only three of us could drink.

1956
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:40,550
I don't think
I can easily say thank you.

1957
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,390
I don't think
I can easily say thank you.

1958
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:48,020
(I hate you, Jong Min!)

1959
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,460
I feel so grateful.

1960
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,460
- This is a ray of light for us.
- Right.

1961
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,360
Thank you, "Problem Child in House."

1962
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:58,970
(Bowing)

1963
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:02,100
(We thank you too, Jong Min.)

1964
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,240
(Soon, the sky turns pink.)

1965
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,540
I got a call from Jong Min.

1966
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,710
Let's answer his call.

1967
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:08,110
- Done, right?
- Answer it.

1968
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:10,540
- Hey, Jong Min.
- Gosh.

1969
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:11,710
Isn't that Jeju Island?

1970
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,950
- Right.
- Where are you now, Jong Min?

1971
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,850
- What?
- Where are you right now?

1972
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:19,520
I'm at the Picasso Museum.

1973
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:21,090
- Are you in France?
- Antibes.

1974
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,920
Yes. Antibes in France.

1975
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:25,460
The sea looks beautiful.

1976
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:28,330
It's great here.
It looks great for you guys too.

1977
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,830
- Jong Min.
- It looks nice.

1978
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,930
- Today,
- It was crazy.

1979
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,340
we will be sleeping outside.
We will be on bivouac.

1980
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:36,370
(It looks nice?
We will be sleeping outside.)

1981
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,500
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

1982
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,710
Is the traveling okay?
Is the schedule tight?

1983
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,380
It's tight.

1984
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:46,310
Is 2 Days and 1 Night tougher
or is the honeymoon tougher?

1985
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:47,350
(Tougher trip: 2 Days and 1 Night
versus Honeymoon)

1986
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,450
It's tougher here.

1987
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,290
(It must be as tough for you
as it is for us.)

1988
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:52,690
You still feel happy, right?

1989
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,760
I do feel happy.

1990
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,920
Have a great time with your wife.

1991
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,830
- Bye. I miss you.
- All right.

1992
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:00,790
Hang in there and don't get hurt.

1993
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,430
Don't drop down the viewer ratings.

1994
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,530
Don't slack off
just because I'm not there.

1995
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:05,730
Okay.

1996
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:09,340
(We'll work hard
after taking a break for a while.)

1997
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,610
(They rest
while using the sky as a blanket.)

1998
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,110
Where is it?

1999
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:15,610
I think it's here.

2000
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,780
(Sighing)

2001
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:19,880
We have to go all the way there
to empty ourselves?

2002
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,950
(Se Yoon and DinDin walk around
looking for the restroom.)

2003
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:21,980
Darn it.

2004
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:25,490
(I can't believe
the production crew.)

2005
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,550
Byung Jin.

2006
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:28,790
(They even meet Byung Jin
on the way.)

2007
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,160
Is the restroom over there?

2008
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,460
It's over there.

2009
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,300
(Sighing)

2010
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,530
Gosh.

2011
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:40,500
Gosh.

2012
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:43,000
(They arrive at the restroom
with a big sigh.)

2013
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,370
We might have to
come back right away...

2014
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,510
as it's so far away.

2015
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:49,580
(Even going to the restroom is hard
on the Bivouac Trip.)

2016
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,840
My gosh.

2017
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:54,850
(Se Yoon has returned
after using the restroom.)

2018
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,120
Gosh.

2019
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,720
(Did something catch his eye?)

2020
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:01,260
Byung Jin is having cup ramyeon.

2021
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,390
(The crew members
are eating at the food truck.)

2022
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:04,660
There must be ramyeon too.

2023
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:06,860
What's on the menu?

2024
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,430
I think there's a fritter dish too.

2025
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,230
I'll just ask.

2026
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:13,130
I won't be having any of it.

2027
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:14,640
I can just take a look.

2028
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,510
There must be
a type of doenjang soup.

2029
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:21,280
I'm just here to take a look.

2030
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,640
(I'm here to take a look
around the food truck.)

2031
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:25,480
Gosh, it's stir-fried spicy pork.

2032
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,480
I heard the food is insane today.

2033
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,850
- It's good.
- The fritters are really good.

2034
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:33,220
(Sighing)

2035
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:35,220
It looks so good.

2036
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,960
(Today's food truck dishes
that caught Se Yoon's attention)

2037
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,430
(Crunchy fried chicken,
seasoned squid and water parsley,)

2038
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:40,690
(fruit, and stir-fried spicy pork)

2039
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:42,700
Gosh, stir-fried spicy pork
is my favorite.

2040
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:44,670
It tastes great mixed or as wraps.

2041
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:46,670
- What kind of soup is it?
- It's seaweed soup.

2042
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,770
They serve great soup here too.

2043
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,240
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2044
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,180
(I want some.
I desperately want some.)

2045
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,380
Is it good?

2046
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:01,980
Is it good?

2047
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,320
(Nodding)

2048
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:07,250
(Walking around the ones eating)

2049
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,220
(Se Yoon's manager)

2050
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,620
Right. You need to put in some rice.

2051
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,130
You need to put in some rice.

2052
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:15,400
(They're eating
without making any eye contact.)

2053
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,500
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

2054
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:19,730
- The food must be good today.
- Gosh.

2055
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:21,300
- It's crunchy fried chicken.
- Really?

2056
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,440
Yes. It's boneless.

2057
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:24,740
Is it not seasoned?

2058
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:26,970
Would you like to try one,
pretending it to be a mistake?

2059
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,710
No. The cameras are coming.

2060
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,910
I want to give it a try.

2061
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,010
We can have food dropped
on the floor.

2062
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:32,150
Will you drop some for us?

2063
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,410
It smells so good.

2064
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,750
Should we just smell the food?

2065
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:36,780
(Looks and smell that make you
want some...)

2066
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:37,820
(even if it's dropped on the floor)

2067
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:40,120
Should we play rock-paper-scissors
for a piece of the chicken?

2068
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,220
It will be just between
the two of us.

2069
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:45,790
We'll play rock-paper-scissors
just for fun.

2070
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,090
Is a piece
of crunchy fried chicken okay?

2071
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:48,800
It should be for the crumbs.

2072
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,800
What?

2073
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,730
He said the crumbs are okay.

2074
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,670
- The crumbs.
- That fool.

2075
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:54,900
The crumbs are just as good.

2076
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,300
(The crumbs are the kick
of crunchy fried chicken.)

2077
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,300
Look here.

2078
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:59,340
- It'll be for this piece.
- What?

2079
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,440
- This one.
- Okay.

2080
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:03,340
(A rather big crumb is chosen.)

2081
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,680
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2082
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,510
(Se Yoon can attack first
as it's scissors against paper.)

2083
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:10,050
Dibidibidip!

2084
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,250
(Paper against rock)

2085
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:12,550
Dibidibidip!

2086
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:14,190
(Se Yoon attacks again
with rock against scissors.)

2087
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:16,290
(Torn)

2088
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,160
Dibidibidip! Yes!

2089
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,930
(Se Yoon wins.)

2090
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,670
Let me just smell it.

2091
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:26,830
Just smell it with your nose.
I'll block your mouth.

2092
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:29,170
(His mouth is covered
just in case he eats it.)

2093
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,170
- It must be so good.
- It smells great.

2094
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:37,080
As expected.

2095
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:43,220
(The sun has fully set.)

2096
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:46,950
(Night has come to the base camp.)

2097
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,160
(He checks the time.)

2098
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:57,160
(The time that these members
have been waiting for)

2099
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,930
You are all hungry, right?

2100
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:00,130
- Yes.
- Yes.

2101
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,540
- Very hungry.
- All right.

2102
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,940
For dinner,

2103
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,840
you will be given
the food from the food truck...

2104
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,640
that tastes especially great today.

2105
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,110
- Right.
- The food looked amazing.

2106
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,880
(Packed as the food is amazing)

2107
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:13,110
What do they have?
I heard it's
rice with stir-fried spicy pork.

2108
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:16,820
- Spicy pork ssambap
- As special dishes,

2109
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,320
the owner prepared...

2110
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,550
spicy pork ssambap
and crunchy fried chicken.

2111
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:20,690
(Spicy pork ssambap
and crunchy fried chicken)

2112
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:24,220
(Sweet and salty
stir-fried spicy pork...)

2113
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,730
(and freshly fried
crunchy fried chicken)

2114
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:32,070
(There are many other
delicious dishes too.)

2115
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:34,840
All right, then.
You all can get your food.

2116
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:36,740
- What?
- Stop being like that.

2117
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,970
- Really?
- You can just get your food.

2118
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:41,380
We can have all of it?
I don't believe him.

2119
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:43,210
- You're serious, right?
- Yes. Get your food for now.

2120
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,540
Let's do as we're told.

2121
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,680
I'm going to get a lot of food.

2122
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:47,480
- He said "for now."
- Can we eat right away?

2123
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:48,650
Get your food for now.

2124
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,220
That means
there is something behind this.

2125
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,150
- I'm going to get the food.
- Go ahead.

2126
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:53,150
(They put aside their doubts...)

2127
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,220
There's seaweed soup too.

2128
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:56,220
(and start to serve themselves
a good amount of food.)

2129
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,560
The rice looks good
as it's nice and fluffy.

2130
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:00,790
The seaweed soup looks good.

2131
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,100
Angelica leaves!

2132
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,670
(A mountain of Angelica leaves)

2133
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,300
Thank you.

2134
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:08,540
Where are you going, Seon Ho?

2135
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,470
I'm not done yet.

2136
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:13,370
Did everyone say
the kimchi was good?

2137
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:14,610
Yes. It was really popular.

2138
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,480
(A tray full of food)

2139
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,280
It looks a bit messy,

2140
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,610
but this is my food.

2141
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:22,620
(Feeling great)

2142
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,890
All five of you
have returned, right?

2143
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:27,890
- Yes.
- Thank you for the food.

2144
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:28,960
Thank you.

2145
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:30,760
It's the moment we all waited for.

2146
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,190
- It's my favorite segment.
- All right, everyone.

2147
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:33,690
Go and stick them quickly.

2148
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:34,730
Stick what?

2149
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:36,360
What's going on?

2150
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,360
(Rushing over)

2151
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,500
What?

2152
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:40,630
- What's going on?
- Do we have to win them?

2153
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:41,640
(Number stickers
are stuck on the dishes?)

2154
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,770
Oh, come on! I'm hungry!

2155
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:45,870
There must be an order. No?

2156
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:48,440
- There are so many numbers.
- I guess we must choose.

2157
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,440
Gosh, we're doomed.

2158
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:52,280
All right, everyone.

2159
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:54,080
Today's Dinner Game...

2160
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,080
is Problematic Stir-Fried Pork Men.

2161
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:58,920
(The production crew
would never give us food for free.)

2162
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,720
All right. It's a team game.

2163
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,090
- A team game?
- Yes.

2164
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,930
- A team game? No!
- Why not?

2165
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:06,990
Don't we have to
answer questions for this one?

2166
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,760
- Right.
- That can't happen!

2167
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,860
Because of who?

2168
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,530
Who will make this a tough one?

2169
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:18,840
(If you are to ask who...)

2170
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:21,680
(Let's stop finding out.)

2171
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:23,010
Who will make this a tough one?

2172
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,710
- All right.
- Tell me!

2173
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:27,210
All right, everyone.
This is a quiz...

2174
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:29,380
where everyone must answer correctly
for each bowl.

2175
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,750
- Everyone must answer correctly?
- Yes.

2176
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,450
The numbers on the bowls
represent the rounds.

2177
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:36,220
(There are a total of 8 rounds.)

2178
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:37,860
When you all answer
the question correctly,

2179
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:40,090
you will win that bowl.

2180
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,160
The bowl will be taken right away
if you fail.

2181
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,460
(The bowl will be taken away.)

2182
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:45,670
The bowls for number one
are all different. What do you have?

2183
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:46,670
Let's start with Seon Ho.

2184
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:47,700
- What's number one for you?
- The crunchy fried chicken.

2185
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:48,800
- Next.
- It's the fried chicken for me too.

2186
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,600
- The shredded radish kimchi.
- Shredded radish kimchi.

2187
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,840
It's the seasoned squid
and water parsley for me.

2188
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,210
It's kimchi for me.

2189
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:54,780
The kimchi is really good.

2190
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:55,840
- This is so precious.
- Gosh.

2191
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,980
We will begin.

2192
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,750
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2193
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,280
Should we just open them up and eat?

2194
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,880
What?

2195
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,480
That could be a refreshing scene
for the viewers.

2196
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,750
Right.
That has never happened before.

2197
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:07,850
- Let's eat right away.
- Okay. One, two, three!

2198
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:08,990
Hold on!

2199
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:10,160
Should we listen to
the first question first?

2200
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,560
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

2201
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,830
- Hold on.
- Right.

2202
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:13,890
What?

2203
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:15,860
How could you do that?

2204
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,500
- All right.
- Please give us an easy one.

2205
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:19,870
For the first round,

2206
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:21,870
we have upgraded...

2207
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:24,070
the original Guess Who.

2208
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,410
It's Guess Who of the past.

2209
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:29,140
Just like the original Guess Who,

2210
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:31,010
you must guess the person
in three seconds.

2211
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:34,110
But it won't be how
the person currently looks.

2212
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,450
- It will be from the past.
- How will we guess it then?

2213
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:37,880
Could it be
from when that person was a rookie?

2214
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:41,660
We'll begin. One, two, thee.

2215
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:49,530
(Who is this baby?)

2216
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,730
- Kim Jong Min!
- Really?

2217
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:54,230
Correct.

2218
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,440
- Kim Jong Min.
- How did you get that right?

2219
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:57,240
(This baby grows up...)

2220
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:59,140
(to become Kim Jong Min.)

2221
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:01,040
(End of game rule description)

2222
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:03,380
- I really can't tell people.
- We'll start from the right.

2223
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,810
You just need to
answer it once each.

2224
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:07,210
- Just once, right?
- Yes.

2225
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:08,250
We'll begin.

2226
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:09,980
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2227
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,150
One, two, three, go!

2228
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:14,890
You must know this one.

2229
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:17,960
- Ta-da!
- You must know this one.

2230
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,130
- IU.
- Right.

2231
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,360
- Correct.
- How did you know that?

2232
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,560
- How are we supposed to know?
- I didn't know who that was.

2233
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,060
Please, Sae Ho.

2234
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,730
One, two, three, go!

2235
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:27,430
- Three...
- Yoo Byung Jae!

2236
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,000
- Really?
- Yes.

2237
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,010
- Correct.
- How did you know that?

2238
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:33,070
- Well...
- How did you know that?

2239
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:34,340
- I've seen that one.
- Gosh.

2240
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,710
(It's Joon's turn next.)

2241
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:36,880
Get ready.

2242
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:39,410
One, two, three, go!

2243
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:42,180
- Three,
- Who is that?

2244
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:43,250
- two...
- Son Ye Jin.

2245
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:44,620
- Is it Son Ye Jin?
- Correct.

2246
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:46,320
- What?
- My goodness.

2247
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,550
That's a famous photo.

2248
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,520
- Let's continue.
- I thought it was Ko Hyun Jung.

2249
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,390
I would recognize Ko Hyun Jung.

2250
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:52,660
- One...
- Se Yoon...

2251
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:55,060
- One, two, three, go!
- I'm sorry.

2252
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,460
- What?
- Three, two...

2253
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:58,600
That's...

2254
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:03,370
(Who is this adorable kid?)

2255
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,500
Go!

2256
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,640
- What?
- Three, two...

2257
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,640
- Is it Eun Woo?
- One.

2258
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:10,440
- Is it Eun Woo?
- One.

2259
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:11,980
- Is it Eun Woo?
- One.

2260
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,050
Cho...

2261
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:14,180
(Time's up.)

2262
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:16,150
- What?
- Sae Ho.

2263
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:17,380
(Answer: Cho Sae Ho)

2264
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,350
We're really stupid.

2265
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:21,390
He just looks like a pretty boy
in the neighborhood.

2266
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:24,520
Everyone. We will take Dish One.

2267
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,260
To be honest, I don't need chicken
in this situation.

2268
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,230
For me, number two is also chicken.

2269
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,630
What? Did you take two?

2270
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:34,430
My gosh. How could he think
of taking two?

2271
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,470
I should try my best
for number two. It's kimchi.

2272
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:38,970
- Okay.
- I have to do my utmost.

2273
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:40,140
- Okay.
- For me, it's rolled omelet.

2274
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:41,610
Mine is ketchup.

2275
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:42,810
Mine is kimchi.

2276
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:45,050
- It's a seasoned dish.
- A seasoned dish.

2277
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:48,350
You know, we continued
until the fourth player.

2278
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:50,080
Maybe we can succeed.

2279
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,050
- Right.
- Let's keep the momentum going.

2280
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:54,690
All right. Let's begin.

2281
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,060
- Okay.
- Seon Ho, you can do this.

2282
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:00,160
- Okay.
- One, two, three, go!

2283
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,500
- Three,
- I get it.

2284
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,400
- two,
- I know who it is.

2285
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,130
- One.
- Is it Ms. Hye Soo? Kim Hye Soo.

2286
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:09,470
- Correct.
- That's it.

2287
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,310
Thank you for making it easy.

2288
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:14,010
Se Yoon.

2289
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:16,740
You should say the name
of the person on the left.

2290
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,250
The one on the left. All right.

2291
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:21,410
- Why are there two? The same ones?
- One...

2292
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,150
One, two, three, go!

2293
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:24,250
- Three.
- The one on the left.

2294
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,750
- Two.
- Yang Se Hyeong.

2295
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:27,750
- We know this one.
- Correct.

2296
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,620
- Okay.
- Yang Se Hyeong and Yang Se Chan.

2297
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:30,920
Okay. Brothers.

2298
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:33,160
Joon, good luck with this.

2299
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,590
- Let's continue.
- We're almost there.

2300
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,900
One, two, three, go!

2301
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:38,930
Three...

2302
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:45,910
(Who's that?)

2303
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,280
- Three...
- Moon Se Yoon.

2304
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,640
What? How did you know?

2305
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:50,810
- It does look like him.
- My gosh.

2306
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,750
- Really?
- I took a guess.

2307
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:56,880
(It's amazing
that he recognized Se Yoon!)

2308
01:21:57,550 --> 01:22:00,220
- Take a guess.
- Next. One, two, three, go!

2309
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:01,720
- Three, two...
- Kim Sook.

2310
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:02,760
That's it!

2311
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,220
- Correct.
- Okay.

2312
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:05,830
- The last one.
- I didn't know.

2313
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:06,930
(If DinDin gets it right,
they succeed.)

2314
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:08,860
One, two, three, go!

2315
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,230
- It's him, right?
- Three, two,

2316
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:12,500
- The figure skater.
- One.

2317
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,100
- Our Cha Jun Hwan.
- Okay!

2318
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,370
- Correct.
- Okay.

2319
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,900
- By the way...
- Why was this round for ketchup?

2320
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:19,910
- I'm sorry, but...
- What? You got ketchup?

2321
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:21,210
- Yes, it's ketchup.
- I got water parsley.

2322
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:23,480
Someone dropped a piece of kimchi
on the ketchup.

2323
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:26,080
(Enjoy it.)

2324
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:28,680
Will this round be similar?

2325
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,850
- Yes.
- This is too difficult.

2326
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:32,950
- Really?
- I just took a guess.

2327
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:34,520
Let's see what number three is.

2328
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,620
What's yours?

2329
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,260
I have seasoned squid and water parsley.
I want to eat this.

2330
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:39,390
I have shredded radish kimchi.

2331
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:41,900
- Mine is ssamjang.
- Ssamjang?

2332
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,000
Mine is kimchi
and shredded radish kimchi.

2333
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,970
- Ssamjang...
- I have crunchy fried chicken.

2334
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:48,300
Ssamjang is meaningless.
I don't need this.

2335
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,570
I should mix
shredded radish kimchi with rice.

2336
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:50,840
What's yours? Ssamjang?

2337
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:53,070
- Ssamjang.
- Honestly, you can replace...

2338
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:54,610
ssamjang with the sauce
of stir-fried spicy pork.

2339
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:55,710
- Yes.
- Right.

2340
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:57,640
- Seon Ho will go first.
- My gosh.

2341
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:58,650
(The first player, Seon Ho)

2342
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:00,410
- My gosh.
- Pull yourself together.

2343
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:02,180
I really don't know.
I didn't recognize anyone.

2344
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,750
I understand.
That's because you're young.

2345
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,620
(Nervous)

2346
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:10,060
One, two, three, go!

2347
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:11,460
- Three.
- Darn it.

2348
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:13,490
- Gosh, he looks so mischievous.
- Two.

2349
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:15,400
- What? Seriously?
- DinDin?

2350
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,030
One. Correct.

2351
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:18,870
- Seriously?
- Really?

2352
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:20,800
I took the photo in Canada.

2353
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,240
- In Canada...
- You look so mischievous.

2354
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:24,770
Did you have a plastic surgery?

2355
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,870
Hey, who are you?

2356
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:28,340
- In Canada...
- Did you get your eyes done?

2357
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:30,740
No. It was when my sister had
her graduation pictures taken.

2358
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:32,850
I really didn't want to go that day.

2359
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:34,410
So I had a huge fight with her.

2360
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:36,650
I took the picture
with my eyes all puffy.

2361
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,150
- You look so cute.
- All right.

2362
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:41,420
One, two, three, go!

2363
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:45,160
- Three, two, one.
- Who's that?

2364
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,290
Hey.

2365
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:49,130
(Don't you recognize him?)

2366
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,200
- What?
- Who is that?

2367
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,930
- Who is it?
- It's obvious. I know.

2368
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,730
- Do you know who it is?
- I do.

2369
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,200
It's Yoo Seon Ho.

2370
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,240
- Is it you?
- It's me.

2371
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,370
It's Seon Ho's face.

2372
01:23:58,370 --> 01:23:59,940
- Seon Ho.
- Why did you gain so much weight?

2373
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:02,540
You're not sharp-sighted.
Obviously, it's Yoo Seon Ho.

2374
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:04,180
Right. Look at the eyes.
He has my eyes.

2375
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,210
Now that you say that,
I can tell it's Seon Ho.

2376
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:07,780
I have nothing to say.

2377
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,420
- We lost number 3?
- You lost number 3.

2378
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,820
- Shredded radish kimchi. Okay.
- You failed Round Three.

2379
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,550
- I lost the water parsley.
- I only have ketchup.

2380
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:15,790
I lost shredded radish kimchi.

2381
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,290
It's kimchi now.

2382
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:20,230
Mine is water parsley.

2383
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:22,360
Mine is stir-fried spicy pork.
I have to succeed.

2384
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,760
- Mine is kimchi.
- Is it stir-fried spicy pork?

2385
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:24,760
Yes.

2386
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,130
- Stir-fried spicy pork...
- Is the pork number four?

2387
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:27,570
Yes. It's number four.

2388
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:30,570
I think it will be
really difficult this time.

2389
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:31,770
Everyone.

2390
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:33,640
We will change the format this time.

2391
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,710
Now...

2392
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:36,240
(Please make it easy.)

2393
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,080
- We prepared another new quiz.
- Okay.

2394
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:41,480
It's a quiz that makes full use
of the greatness of Hangeul.

2395
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,450
It's Jumbled Hangeul Quiz.

2396
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:44,680
- Jumbled?
- Yes.

2397
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:47,820
Did you know that you can understand
the meaning of a Korean word...

2398
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,560
even when the letters are jumbled?

2399
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,020
- Yes.
- For example?

2400
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,560
I'll show you an example.

2401
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,990
(Tyr to gseus. Jmubled Huagenl Qiuz)

2402
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,500
You will see a word
with the letters jumbled...

2403
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,900
and answer what the word is
in three seconds.

2404
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,400
(Mallowmarsh, marshmallow)

2405
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:03,870
- Mallowmarsh
- It says mallowmarsh.

2406
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:06,040
But you can tell
it says marshmallow.

2407
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,070
Yes.

2408
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:09,840
In this round,
you should go back and forth.

2409
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:12,380
Number four is not important.
I have shredded radish kimchi.

2410
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:14,780
- Please try hard. Mine is pork.
- Really?

2411
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:16,120
Yes. Please let me eat it.

2412
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,150
What are yours?

2413
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:18,620
- Kimchi.
- Kimchi. I need this.

2414
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:20,220
Mine is water parsley.
Kimchi and pork.

2415
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,360
Let's do this. Let's go!

2416
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,890
- Let's go.
- We can do this!

2417
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:26,790
- I can do this.
- Let's go!

2418
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,160
- You should see the whole thing.

01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,300
One, two, three, go!

2427
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:44,540

- Cassette tape.
- That's it.

2433
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:55,020
- Correct.
- Good.

2434
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:56,220
This is difficult.

2435
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:58,420
All right. One, two, three, go!

2436
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,760
(Miboel DI)

2437
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,360

2438
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,560

(Kicewiju)

2444
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,410
- Two...
- Kicewiju.

2445
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:16,140

2446
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,380
- Correct.
- Okay. It's kiwi juice.

2447
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:20,180

01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:21,980
One, two, three, go!

2449
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:24,020

2455
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:35,300
- Good luck, Seon Ho.
- We're going to eat this.

2456
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:38,030
- We got all the questions right.
- One, two, three, go!

2457
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:40,830

2461
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:49,510
You were bad with the previous game,
but you did well this time.

2462
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,680
- Well done.
- I can't see it.

2463
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,750
Sae Ho, what is "kicewiju?"

2464
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,680
Can you describe it with action?

2465
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:59,750
I've never heard such a word before.

2466
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:01,750
So... In the morning...

2467
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:03,690
- How was the quiz?
- It was fun.

2468
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:05,090

- I'm grateful.

2469
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:06,230
- I really liked it.
- Seon Ho.

2470
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:08,530
- You should go first. I can't see.
- Okay.

2471
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:09,900
Is it Round Five?

2472
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:11,130
(It's already Round 5
of the Dinner Game.)

2473
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:13,130
Let's talk about number five now.
What's your dish?

2474
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:15,270
- Mine is ssamjang.
- Me too.

2475
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:16,300
Mine is ssamjang.

2476
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,800
Number five is one piece
of crunchy fried chicken.

2477
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:19,270
Obviously, it's...

2478
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:20,840
Obviously, the small one
is for ssamjang.

2479
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,610
I have one piece
of crunchy fried chicken.

2480
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,040
Let's try it with a light heart.

2481
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:26,950
Let's begin.

2482
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:29,120
One, two, three, go!

2483
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:32,120
- Three, two, one.
- Wedding fair.

2484
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,190
- Correct.
- That was confusing.

2485
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:35,690
Go.

2486
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:37,520
- Three, two...
- Hayashi rice.

2487
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,230
- Correct.
- That's it.

2488
01:27:39,230 --> 01:27:41,360
Se Yoon is the only one
who can get it right.

2489
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:45,100
- Go. Three, two, one.
- What?

2490
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,530
- This is about 2 Days and 1 Night.
- I see.

2491
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,740
Sand lance coffee.

2492
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,900
- Correct.
- It's not an actual word.

2493
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,710
- Right. That's why.
- I was really surprised.

2494
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:55,270
- I was startled.
- It's not an actual word.

2495
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,910
- Good job.
- I thought it was carbonara.

2496
01:27:56,910 --> 01:27:59,480
Let's continue. One, two, three, go!

2497
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:01,750
- Three, two,
- It's too easy.

2498
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:02,980
- one.
- Half marathon.

2499
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:03,980
- Correct.
- My gosh.

2500
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:05,320
- I didn't know.
- I thought it was free marathon.

2501
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,950
- I can't see.
- Let's continue.

2502
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:08,920
- Good luck.
- One, two, three, go!

2503
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,120
- Three... Correct.
- Castanets!

2504
01:28:11,290 --> 01:28:12,490
Get some rest.

2505
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:15,160
Let's continue. One, two, three, go!

2506
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,360
- Three...
- ChoNam Zone.

2507
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,460
Correct.

01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:18,630
Zhomencoan.

2509
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,170

- Correct.

2512
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,610
- We will get ssamjang.

2513
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:29,040
- Three...
- Golden retriever.

- It's done.
- Seon Ho.

2516
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:34,810
One, two, three, go!

2517
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:37,120
(It is the most difficult question
with seven syllables.)

2518
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,450
- It's easy.
- Two.

2519
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:40,090
- One.
- Do you not know that?

2520
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:41,550
- What?
- "Never Ending Story."

2521
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:43,560
"Never Ending Story."

2522
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:45,690
- Correct.
- Okay.

2523
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,430
- Why did you do that?
- My gosh.

2524
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:49,300
- I saw something else at first.
- Gosh.

2525
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:50,960
I thought it was about a bus.

2526
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:52,630
- I thought it was Thomas the train.
- I thought...

2527
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:54,700
it was the name of a city
in Germany.

2528
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:57,040
Something like Dinrineverstoen.

2529
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,640
- Well done.
- We did it anyway.

2530
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:01,540
But it's ssamjang.

2531
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,740
- It's important now.
- Now it's a big game.

2532
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:07,110
- Numbers 6, 7, and 8 are...
- Numbers 6, 7, and 8.

2533
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:08,920
This is a big deal.

2534
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:10,520
- What's yours? Tell me.
- Rice.

2535
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,390
- It's rice for me.
- Mine is also rice.

2536
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:14,320
- I pressed it.
- Mine is seaweed soup.

2537
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:15,490
(Seon Ho's number 6
is seaweed soup.)

2538
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,960
- What's yours?
- Mine is really important.

2539
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,160
- Is it pork?
- It's pork.

2540
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,190
Mine is rice.

2541
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:20,530
What's yours, Se Yoon?

2542
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:23,030
- It's pork.
- Okay. I get it.

2543
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:25,030
- Start from Seon Ho?
- Do you want to do it, DinDin?

2544
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:26,730
You go first. Get over it.

2545
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,230
- Let's go!
- Get over it.

2546
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,370
- All right. Get over it.
- Good. You can do this.

2547
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:31,670
This is the main match.

2548
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:33,110
- Let's do this.
- It's for the pork.

2549
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:34,640
- Hey.
- I'll get myself the pork.

2550
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:37,380
All right. Let's continue.

2551
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:39,380
One, two, three, go!

2552
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:40,750
- Three,
- Good.

2553
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:41,750
- two...
- "Sonata of Temptation."

2554
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,350
- Okay. Let's go.
- Correct!

2555
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,690
One, two, three, go!

2556
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:46,850
Paragliding.

2557
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:48,050
- Okay.
- Correct.

2558
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:49,190
Okay, that was easy.

2559
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:50,790
One, two, three, go!

2560
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:51,790
"Mission Impossible."

2561
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:53,460
- Correct.
- Well done.

2562
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:54,960
- You're good at this.
- He's really good.

2563
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,900
One, two, three, go!

2564
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:00,270
- Three, two, one!
- Jeju...

2565
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,970
- Special...
- What are you doing?

2566
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:04,500
- Wrong!
- What is that?

2567
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,610
Jeju Special
Self-governing Province.

2568
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:08,140
It's Jeju Special
Self-governing Province.

2569
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:09,980
(My rice...)

2570
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,280
I got it right.

2571
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,950
No. That's not what you said.

2572
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:14,080
What did I say?

2573
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:18,380
- Jeju Special...
- Jeju Island... City...

2574
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:19,990
I lost the rice.

2575
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:22,260
(Why did I say that?)

2576
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:23,890
(Going insane)

2577
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:24,920
This is bad.

2578
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,390
- It's pointless.
- I didn't think that...

2579
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:27,990
Jeju Special
Self-governing Province...

2580
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:29,100
I got confused.

2581
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:31,960
I should've said "special,"
but I saw "province."

2582
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,100
Yes, it stands out.

2583
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:34,870
(The syllable stood out
and confused him.)

2584
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:37,270
Okay. I apologize.

2585
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:38,500
I lost the rice.

2586
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:39,670
- It can't be helped.
- Sorry.

2587
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:41,170
Let's take them out.

2588
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,940
It got frigid.

2589
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:44,010
(What will happen to their dinner?)

2590
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:45,980
(Next episode)

2591
01:30:46,510 --> 01:30:48,750
(The one that stole
everyone's attention)

2592
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,550
(The last batch
of luxurious supplies)

2593
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:53,350
- One person...
- All of that?

2594
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,290
(One person gets it all.)

2595
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:58,520
(They're more desperate than ever.)

2596
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:01,260
(They fight
for a good night's sleep.)

2597
01:31:02,530 --> 01:31:04,200
(They even get injured.)

2598
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:05,900
Mission Lymphadenitis.

2599
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,940
(Who will obtain
the luxurious items?)

2600
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:12,740
(They set off
in search of treasure.)

2601
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,140
(6 explorers)

2602
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:17,340
(They dive...)

2603
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:18,850
(into the sea.)

2604
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:21,550
(They trek...)

2605
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:23,680
(through forests.)

2606
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:27,150
(They'll go anywhere for treasure.)

2607
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:29,690
(They're chased,)

2608
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:31,520
(abandoned,)

2609
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,130
(and detained.)

2610
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:38,800
(Tamra Treasure Expedition)
