1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,740
(Where the blue sea
meets a grassy plain)

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,940
This kind of place exists?

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,280
It smells of vitamins.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,520
It's beautiful here.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,080
There's a windmill.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,220
- Is this the Netherlands?
- It's the Netherlands.

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,890
- Look at the hill.
- Gosh.

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,790
It's like a scene from a TV drama.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,830
- I've been here before.
- You have?

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,560
- I'm out of breath.
- My grandma lives here.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,760
- Oh, really?
- Does she?

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,260
Tell her to come over.

13
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,400
Tell her to come now.

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,000
To play
Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My grandma too?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,540
Does she sleep in a tent
if she loses?

17
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,110
We can sleep at her place.

18
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,310
(We can sleep at her place.)

19
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,380
- Hello.
- Hooray!

20
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,810
(You can't help but shout.)

21
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,350
(What kind of trip
will they have here?)

22
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,050
The further from Seoul,
the prettier the scenery.

23
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,690
- Yes.
- How many kilometers did we travel?

24
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,190
Did you keep your word?

25
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,520
- Was it 340km?
- Did we come too far?

26
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,920
No, it was 450km.

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,260
- It was 450km from Seoul.
- What?

28
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,030
Wasn't it supposed to be over 300km?

29
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,330
(Why are they
asking about the distance?)

30
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,030
(Last week, they played a game...)

31
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,170
(to decide the theme of this trip.)

32
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,130
(Sae Ho spun the spinning wheel.)

33
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,400
It's right.

34
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,700
(Destination: The sea)

35
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,710
(Se Yoon threw a dart.)

36
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,380
(Distance: Over 300km from Seoul)

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,210
As you selected,

38
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,980
we're over 300km away from Seoul.

39
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,220
- Yes.
- And by the sea.

40
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,150
- The sea.
- In Geoje, South Gyeongsang.

41
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,690
(Geoje)

42
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,620
(Amazing sights wherever you go)

43
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,690
(The refreshing sound of wind...)

44
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,430
(coupled with the sound
of rolling pebbles.)

45
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,230
(It's where your eyes
and ears can heal.)

46
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,200
(Geoje, South Gyeongsang Province)

47
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,900
- It's nice to be in Geoje.
- Yes.

48
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,970
But you must keep your word.
The deal was "over 300km."

49
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,910
Didn't we travel over 400km?

50
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,370
That's also over 300km.

51
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,080
We could just fly to the US, then.

52
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,410
"This is over 300km away too."

53
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,550
We had to travel over 300km,
and we traveled 425km.

54
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,650
You said we'd be fed.

55
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,420
We want to be fed three meals.

56
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,820
- Yes.
- That's right.

57
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,820
(Why is that?)

58
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,550
What else was there? Do we eat?

59
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,790
- We get a feast.
- The food, the feast...

60
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,120
- Was it a lavish spread?
- Yes.

61
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,830
- Was it nine side dishes?
- Yes.

62
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,930
(They're making things up.)

63
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,560
- There were nine dishes, I think.
- Yes.

64
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,700
- Right.
- Something like that.

65
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,730
It's one filling meal.

66
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,930
- One filling meal.
- One filling meal.

67
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,530
And no one gets left behind.

68
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,030
- No abandoning.
- That's right.

69
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,570
(Joon won them one filling meal.)

70
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,110
(Cham, Cham, Cham!)

71
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,380
(DinDin aced Cham, Cham, Cham...)

72
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,350
(and made sure
no one will be abandoned.)

73
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,610
(Over 300km from Seoul,)

74
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,480
(by the sea, no one gets abandoned,)

75
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,420
(and they eat one filling meal.)

76
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,050
The distance was a hazard,
but the rest was pretty good.

77
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,290
- Yes.
- That distance...

78
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,490
is your fault.

79
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,490
I carry the heaviest burden.

80
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,260
- We let you off lightly.
- Of course.

81
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,490
I left home the night before
for the first time in a while.

82
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,230
DinDin got here the day before.

83
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,470
- Again?
- Yes.

84
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,540
He and I met at around 8 p.m.

85
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,370
We talked happily over a meal.

86
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,140
(A satisfactory meal
accompanied by a chat)

87
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,840
He'll make a habit
of arriving the day before.

88
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,580
- See...
- "This is great."

89
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,650
Geoje Island is so far away.

90
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,220
I had to leave
so early in the morning.

91
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,650
- For the first time...
- Yes.

92
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,720
- I decided to come the day before.
- Right.

93
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,020
- I met Sae Ho...
- He doesn't usually do that.

94
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,250
- and we had dinner,
- Yes.

95
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,520
then we went to the hotel
and had a beer,

96
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,620
- then decided to sleep.
- Right.

97
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,790
I said, "Sleep well, Sae Ho."

98
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,060
Late into the night, this guy...

99
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,600
"Join me for a beer."

100
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,230
- We drank...
- "I just arrived."

101
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,770
"Let me enjoy
the night before the shoot."

102
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,000
"Join me for beer."

103
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,640
Sae Ho sent a photo of him sleeping.

104
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,040
He asked me to keep him company.

105
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,580
I did that,

106
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,880
- and it was the same...
- Yes.

107
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,280
- as leaving from Seoul.
- Yes.

108
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,510
- No.
- What was the point?

109
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,720
There's a huge difference.

110
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,120
- You have a story to tell.
- Yes.

111
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,520
Joon. I'll buy you dinner.

112
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,520
Next time, how about you...

113
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,260
It was a shame.

114
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,330
DinDin and I
had a great conversation.

115
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,630
- Yes.
- If I'd known,

116
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,830
I'd have filmed it
for my YouTube channel.

117
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,170
I swear to bring a camera next time.

118
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,970
Behind the scenes of 2 Days and 1 Night.

119
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,070
That's a good idea.

120
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,910
As soon as he met Joon today,

121
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,910
he tried to tempt him
to come the day before.

122
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,310
Does that mean
we film 3 Days 2 Nights?

123
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,310
Yes.

124
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,050
- That's a good idea.
- Is it?

125
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,750
- It's nice to come the day before.
- Isn't it?

126
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,180
- It's nice.
- You're all on a high.

127
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,520
DinDin looks good today.

128
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,320
Some of us come the day before...

129
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,420
to relax and enjoy the evening.

130
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,720
Some come on the day...

131
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,630
and eat a local breakfast.

132
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,930
- Yes.
- That's these two.

133
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,430
- We had breakfast.
- What did you eat?

134
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,600
Grilled red seaperch...

135
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,830
- Red seaperch?
- That's nice.

136
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,130
And a marinated raw crab set meal.

137
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,200
- Yes.
- And two bowls of rice.

138
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,300
- Yes.
- Two bowls?

139
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,440
There are restaurants
that open at 7 a.m.?

140
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,870
There are always two.

141
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,870
- Really?
- Never three.

142
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,040
- There's at least one.
- There are two.

143
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
They start looking for places
days ahead...

144
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,580
- to find out.
- Yes.

145
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,780
- Right.
- They invite others,

146
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,250
but it's always just these two.

147
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,780
- Well...
- All the time...

148
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,420
This is what Sae Ho can film
for his YouTube.

149
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,550
- The day before,
- Yes.

150
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,520
- you eat with DinDin and Se Yoon.
- Right.

151
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
- In the morning...
- In the morning...
- you join us.
- For breakfast?

152
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,760
I'll be tired the next morning.

153
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,090
Can you film yourselves for me?

154
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,160
I'll try to edit it nicely
so your food looks appetizing.

155
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
"Appetizing?"

156
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,030
Film it with your camera
and send me the file.

157
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,560
You look handsome today.

158
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,830
This morning, he said...

159
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,170
my face looked shattered.

160
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,140
I looked in a mirror and thought
someone had punched me.

161
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,940
You of all people
shouldn't say that.

162
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,670
- We can say that to each other.
- You two fought?

163
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,940
(Is that why your faces are puffy?)

164
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,180
We fought?

165
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,210
Us three fought.

166
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,450
- Us three...
- Yes.

167
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,810
And then...

168
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,420
- It's a close fight.
- My gosh.

169
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,790
Anyway, I feel at ease
now that I'm here.

170
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,920
- Yes.
- By the way, it's beautiful here.

171
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,090
- It's good to be so far from Seoul.
- Right.

172
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,520
Let me tell you the theme
of our trip.

173
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,290
Today's trip originated
from the idea...

174
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,300
Sae Ho and Se Yoon suggested
on our last trip.

175
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,330
- We did?
- What was it?

176
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,400
- What was it?
- I don't remember doing that.

177
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,070
Sae Ho talks a lot,
but I rarely talk.

178
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,330
- We must watch what we say.
- What did you have in mind?

179
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,600
- I watch what I say just in case.
- Do you remember what it is?

180
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,900
- No.
- Not at all.

181
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,500
I mean, Sae Ho is super chatty.

182
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,310
He talks all day long.
How can we remember everything?

183
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,640
He shares so many ideas.

184
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,480
He kept talking last night
when we were having dinner.

185
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,880
Hey, they must be
punished properly for this.

186
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,480
- Could you take a step back?
- What's that?

187
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,280
- Isn't that a grill?
- What is that?

188
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,520
- But...
- That looks like a grill.

189
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,220
- what kind of idea did we suggest?
- Is it what I think it is?

190
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,390
- That must be it.
- No. I think we have to guess it.

191
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,860
- Hello.
- Hello.

192
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
- Hello.
- What's that?

193
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,090
Do we have to guess something?

194
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

195
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,430
- What's this?
- We're doomed.

196
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,630
- I think... My gosh.
- Wait.

197
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,830
- Did they really suggest this idea?
- What's this?

198
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,930
- Why would they suggest this?
- It's...

199
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,570
- What did we say?
- On this trip,

200
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,970
we'll follow the idea
Sae Ho and Se Yoon had.

201
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,240
The theme is Six Jong Mins.

202
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,270
- What? What's that?
- What's that?

203
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,340
- Six Jong Mins?
- I see.

204
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,140
- Your memory must be coming to you.
- Yes, I can remember it now.

205
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,080
We said that we should all be
Jong Min at the next shoot.

206
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,410
So we could film an episode
to commemorate Jong Min's marriage.

207
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,850
- I think that's what we discussed.
- I see.

208
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,080
- I'd never say stuff like that.
- Gosh.

209
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,380
It must be Sae Ho, 100 percent.

210
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,590
(We should all dress up
as Jong Min.)

211
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,460
(Se Yoon was the one
who suggested the idea.)

212
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,360
(Sae Ho merely added to his idea.)

213
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,160
(That's why
we prepared this special.)

214
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,560
There's a history.

215
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,830
Jong Min at the age of 20.
Jong Min at the age of 25.

216
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,030
(Jong Min's history is evident
in the pictures.)

217
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,230
- What's that?
- I was 29.

218
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,370
Have you ever worn
this kind of outfit before?

219
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,840
My gosh, look at this.
Yes, this is it.

220
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,610
Jong Min,
could you explain the pictures?

221
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,780
- What were you doing at 20?
- At 20, I was performing "Poison."

222
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,010
- I was Jung Hwa's dancer.
- Yes, that's right.

223
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,110
Jong Min as Jung Hwa's dancer.

224
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,020
- You were quiet back then.
- I rarely talked then.

225
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,350
- You were popular then.
- Yes.

226
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,090
- When you were most popular, right?
- I was most popular then.

227
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,330
(Jong Min's prime,
Kim Poison at the age of 20)

228
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,460
When I was 25,

229
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,830
I sang the theme song
of "One Piece."

230
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,400
- "Accidentally."
- That's when I sang "Accidentally."

231
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,300
- Accidentally
- Is that a sleeveless top?

232
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,600
- That's a sleeveless top.
- Right.

233
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,710
(The birth of his best song,
Kim Accidentally at the age of 25)

234
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,740
And that's me at the 1st shoot
of 2 Days and 1 Night.

235
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,150
(Kim First Shoot at the age of 29)

236
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,910
- That was in 2007. I was 6.
- It was in 2007.

237
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,950
That's when it began.

238
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,550
(The start of the 18-year history,
Kim First Shoot at the age of 29)

239
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,620
(The legendary scene came about
as he got dragged away.)

240
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,860
(The kidnapping of Kim Jong Min,
Kim Public Service Worker at 31)

241
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,200
(And there was
another legendary scene.)

242
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,200
(If possible,
try to make the red part visible.)

243
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,470
(Try it.)

244
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,300
("If possible...")

245
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,370
No, try doing it.

246
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,840
(A two-word legend,
Kim Possible at the age of 34)

247
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,540
My gosh, everyone went crazy
when he said, "possible."

248
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,310
At the time,
he was younger than I am now.

249
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,880
- Right.
- What's this? Kim Tteutto?

250
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,380
- That's...
- Justin Bieber.

251
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,620
Yes. When you rotate his last name,
it looks like Tteutto.

252
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,650
I see. When it's rotated?

253
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,880
- His Korean nickname is Tteutto.
- Oh, that?

254
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,590
- I see.
- Really?

255
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,120
- Justin Bieber...
- People said I resembled him.

256
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,890
(Showing off Bieber's fashion style,
Kim Tteutto at the age of 38)

257
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,930
(Sagging the pants is
the key point.)

258
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,430
(Kim Poison, Kim Accidentally...)

259
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,470
(This is how
6 Jong Mins came about.)

260
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,300
(Chuckling)

261
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,670
- Gosh, this won't be easy.
- My gosh.

262
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,470
- My gosh, it's too cold for this.
- This won't be easy.

263
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,440
- How can we wear sleeveless tops?
- All of these...

264
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,280
- This won't be easy.
- represent Jong Min.

265
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
- My gosh.
- Okay.

266
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,050
The theme of today's trip is...

267
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,680
When Life Gives You Age.

268
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,780
- My gosh.
- Age?

269
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,550
That's my favorite drama these days.

270
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,620
- Same here.
- Really?

271
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,750
- It's such a good drama.
- It's...

272
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,060
You will wear
one of these outfits now...

273
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,560
and travel today
as 1 of 6 Jong Mins.

274
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,790
Each outfit represents
a different age as you can see.

275
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,930
- Yes.
- On today's trip,

276
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,960
age will play an important role.

277
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,030
(Okay)

278
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,670
After you travel throughout Geoje,

279
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,110
only two oldest Jong Mins
will face...

280
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,740
a dreadful
and exhausting punishment.

281
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,410
It's dreadful?

282
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,580
Being old is awful as it is.

283
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,450
But two oldest Jong Mins
will face the punishment?

284
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,480
(The two oldest members
will face the punishment?)

285
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,620
You should make younger ones go.

286
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,980
- My gosh. Then basically,
- It's...

287
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,390
- Kim Poison is the best one then.
- it's better to start...

288
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,620
- as Kim Poison.
- Kim Poison is the best.

289
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,220
- Right.
- What's his outfit?

290
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,060
- Does it have a cover-up?
- What's that?

291
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,060
What kind of outfit is this?

292
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,860
- I see. It's a sexy outfit.
- Gosh, that's not an easy one.

293
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,860
- Joon ought to wear this outfit.
- My gosh, but...

294
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,460
- I like that he's young.
- What's this?

295
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,470
But the outfit is too much.

296
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,630
Kim Poison is young, but the outfit
won't be easy to pull off.

297
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,800
It won't be easy.

298
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,640
- What's up with this outfit?
- Well, this is the plainest one.

299
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,410
- Right. The worker one is good too.
- But...

300
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,840
- This one is plain too.
- Kim Public Service Worker.

301
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,640
Jong Min, is there an outfit
you would like to wear?

302
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,040
I'd choose
Kim Public Service Worker's.

303
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,380
No. You can wear
Kim Tteutto's outfit.

304
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,910
You can make your way down
from there...

305
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,780
- in search of youth.
- But it might be too cold...

306
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,020
to wear Kim Poison's outfit...

307
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,620
- or Kim First Shoot's outfit.
- How can we wear...

308
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
- sleeveless tops on this weather?
- Exactly.

309
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,590
I'm sure you'll give us a jacket.

310
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,960
You won't?

311
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,160
Look at his facial expression.
That's a no.

312
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,830
As I foresee intense competition
for the outfits,

313
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,160
- This is...
- you'll play a game...

314
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,470
to pick the outfits.

315
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,070
- Great.
- We'll do it here.

316
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,900
Everyone,
could you stand at the line?

317
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,170
- What's this? Is it here?
- What?

318
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,570
- What is this for?
- What is this for?

319
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,240
We'll play a simple game...

320
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,940
and decide with the Shoe Throw.

321
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,940
- Okay.
- I see.

322
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,510
- Can you see the line over there?
- Yes.

323
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,480
If your shoe goes over the line,
you're disqualified.

324
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,720
You must get your shoe
as close to the line as possible.

325
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
I see.

326
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,220
So it can't go over the line.

327
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,790
- That's harder.
- My gosh, that's hard.

328
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,950
- It's too far.
- This is hard.

329
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,090
Rock-paper-scissors?

330
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,590
- Yes, let's play that.
- Losers will go first.

331
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,060
- Okay.
- Okay.

332
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,360
Rock-paper-scissors.

333
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,430
- Seon Ho will go first.
- Then...
- Seon Ho will go first.
- Okay.

334
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,600
- I'll go first.
- Make it fun.

335
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,860
- Kick it to the ocean.
- What?

336
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,970
- Hey.
- Kick it to the water.

337
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,700
- It'd be so funny if you do that.
- That sounds so fun.

338
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,840
- Right there.
- That sounds fun.

339
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Kick it over there.

340
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,010
- They've been gaslighting me.
- Listen.

341
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,470
You must make it entertaining.
This is a variety show.

342
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,040
- Yes.
- What do you think you're doing?

343
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,140
Or turn around and kick it backward.

344
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,240
- Like this?
- Yes.

345
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,310
- Here I go.
- Let's go.

346
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,750
No practice. This one will count.

347
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,080
- You know that I'm good at this.
- My gosh.

348
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,450
- I'm so good at this.
- My gosh.

349
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
I have a bad feeling about this.

350
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,790
- One, two...
- Mess it up. Go!

351
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
- It went over.
- It's out.
- It's too long.
- Okay.

352
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,360
- Yes.
- Nice.

353
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,360
- That was a nice kick, though.
- It was a nice kick.

354
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,700
- You're so strong.
- All right.

355
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,500
- All right.
- You need to kick it hard like him.

356
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,230
Here's what you do.
You're supposed to walk and kick.

357
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,270
- Listen.
- That won't work.

358
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,670
- You walk like this first.
- Walk.

359
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,870
- He did it. My gosh.
- What?

360
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,870
(He kicks his shoe nonchalantly.)

361
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,570
- Okay.
- Yes.

362
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,080
- What a bummer for you.
- Yes!

363
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,640
To be honest,
I don't want to win first place.

364
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,840
On this show,
placing in the middle...

365
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,850
- is the best.
- Place in the middle.

366
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,580
- Being in the middle is fine.
- Se Yoon, make it entertaining.

367
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,820
What you just did
wasn't entertaining.

368
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,820
- It wasn't entertaining at all.
- All done.

369
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,250
- It wasn't entertaining.
- Isn't it better to cluster them?

370
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,250
Two!

371
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,590
- Come on! What is this?
- Go!

372
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
- What?
- My gosh.

373
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,290
- I did it!
- That wasn't entertaining at all.

374
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,960
I'll sleep indoors!

375
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,390
- Come on.
- My gosh.

376
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,390
- This is so fun to watch!
- It's so lame.

377
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,630
- This isn't fun to watch at all.
- How fun.

378
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,700
- Come on.
- Well done.

379
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,900
(Sae Ho tries it next.)

380
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,430
- It will go past the line.
- There you go.

381
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,000
(It goes out of bounds
by a close margin.)

382
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

383
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,340
- I'm in first place right now.
- Okay!

384
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,370
I'm in first place.

385
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,910
Okay.
My goal is to place in the middle!

386
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,470
- Gosh, this is no fun.
- I'm going for the middle.

387
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,740
- Jong Min.
- Yes.

388
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,110
- I...
- Show it to us.

389
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,180
- Yes.
- Leaning back makes it fly high up.

390
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,780
- You must lean forward like this.
- I see. Show it to us then.

391
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,680
- It's like playing soccer.
- Show it to us then.

392
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,780
(Let's see how good he is then.)

393
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,120
Here I go.

394
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,360
- Come on. He did this on purpose.
- What is this?

395
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,760
(A sly trick)

396
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,160
(Jong Min's shoe)

397
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,860
- What is this?
- Hey, that was funny.

398
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,000
(Getting annoyed for some reason)

399
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,430
(Greatly satisfied)

400
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,970
- Well done.
- Darn it.

401
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,070
- Well done.
- It's...

402
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,040
(He couldn't tolerate his annoyance
and kicks it out of bounds.)

403
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,170
Put it back to where it was.

404
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,800
We must take an insert shot of it.

405
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,210
All right. Everyone, you will now...

406
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,110
You will now...

407
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,980
go, pick up your shoe,

408
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,010
and come back to the starting line.
You'll win by the order of return.

409
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,220
(Rushing)

410
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,120
(Oh, no. He totally fooled me.)

411
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,360
(Picking it up quickly)

412
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,290
- Joon.
- I'm in first place!

413
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,500
(Exploding with a dopamine rush
as he gets lucky with 1st place)

414
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,430
- Se Yoon. Seon Ho.
- Yes!

415
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,560
- I won.
- I'm in third place.

416
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,300
- I'm in third place.
- I beat him.

417
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,740
- I came in first.
- No, it was me.

418
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,270
(Seon Ho)

419
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,440
(Seon Ho beat him at the end,
so he's in 3rd place.)

420
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,810
(Meanwhile,
Jong Min will be ranked last.)

421
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,780
This isn't fair.
DinDin kicked my shoe.

422
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,250
It was supposed to be over there.

423
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,310
(DinDin feels bad
as Jong Min feels wronged.)

424
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,880
- DinDin ended up helping us.
- I see.

425
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,920
- I didn't know.
- This is...

426
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,250
He gave us a twist at the end.

427
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,850
- Right. I had no idea.
- Oh, my.

428
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,020
- You gave us a twist.
- I didn't see that coming.

429
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,990
Everyone,
I'll tell you the rankings.

430
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,490
- Joon, Se Yoon,
- That's it.

431
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,830
- Seon Ho, Sae Ho,
- Okay.

432
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,930
DinDin, and Jong Min.

433
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,660
- Bring them in, please.
- Which outfit should I wear?

434
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,530
Gosh, if I pick a younger Jong Min,

435
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,570
the outfit will be too much.

436
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,070
I don't know what the punishment is.

437
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,140
- So that's scary.
- Right.

438
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,470
- Hey.
- Let's start with the winner.

439
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,240
- Go ahead and pick.
- My gosh. This...

440
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,480
- I'm the winner.
- Yes. Which one will you pick?

441
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,180
It feels great to win first place.

442
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,440
If I'm only considering the outfits,

443
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,780
- this one is the best.
- Yes.

444
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,550
That and the second outfit.
I can handle that.

445
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,320
I think this outfit is the worst.

446
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,650
But you must wear that outfit.

447
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,150
This... Hold on.

448
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,450
How revealing is this outfit?

449
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,890
Are you wearing a skirt here?

450
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,220
- No, they're pants.
- They are pants?

451
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,460
Then I'll go with this one for sure.
No question about it.

452
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,360
- Age 20.
- He wants a revealing outfit.

453
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,400
Age 20.

454
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,430
(He's going to pick that outfit?)

455
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,030
- He wants a revealing outfit.
- He's something else.

456
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,400
(They're grateful
that Joon took away the outfit.)

457
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,570
- He wants a revealing outfit.
- I knew it.

458
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,570
I need to win first place
on the show no matter what.

459
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,000
Next, Se Yoon.

460
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,170
- Due to my physique,
- Yes.

461
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,410
my options are limited
when playing games like this.

462
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,740
There must be an outfit
I must choose, right?

463
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,880
- No.
- Really?

464
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,580
We invested our budget for this.

465
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,650
- I told you to give us more food.
- The size.

466
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,020
Why do you keep spending money
on games?

467
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,090
I can wear whatever you have.

468
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,990
He's responsible
for running up our budget.

469
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,860
Because of you,
we lost money for a meal.

470
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Pick that one.
(His best friend recommends
Kim Accidentally.)

471
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,130
- Should I go with this?
- Se Yoon,

472
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,260
- picking a young one is the best.
- This one is young.

473
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,530
- You can be Fat Luffy.
- You must choose a young one.

474
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,900
Put on the hat.

475
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,900
- Well...
- The penalty will be dreadful.

476
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,970
- Okay.
- My gosh.

477
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,540
Wait. You look like Ju Hyun.

478
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,870
- Nice.
- Ju Hyun...

479
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,270
- You look like Ju Hyun.
- My gosh.

480
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,910
You became him
as soon as you put it on.

481
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,440
Or go with
Kim Public Service Worker.

482
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,980
- He's got 1,000 faces.
- Right.

483
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,750
- All right then.
- I might be too cold in this.

484
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,780
Okay.

485
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,080
- Sir, this comes with a jacket.
- Gosh.

486
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,320
- It comes with a jacket.
- Yes.

487
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,350
This is nice.

488
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,050
Then I'll be Moon
Public Service Worker after a while.

489
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,620
- I'll pick him.
- All right. Moon...

490
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,620
- Public Service Worker.
- Okay.

491
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,620
Gosh, he didn't go
with the younger one?

492
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,430
I don't think
it will make a difference.

493
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,030
- Seon Ho is next.
- Okay.

494
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,230
Hey, why don't you experience
being old proactively?

495
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,560
- It won't be so bad.
- Right.

496
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,230
Then I'll pick Kim Possible.

497
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,700
- Okay.
- Kim Possible?

498
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,400
- Really?
- I wanted to pick that one too.

499
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,140
- I'm next, right?
- Sae Ho, pick this one.

500
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,240
- Gosh, no.
- This outfit will keep you warm.

501
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,610
Both of these outfits
have sleeveless shirts.

502
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,910
(He's only considering Jong Mins
in his 20s.)

503
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,680
But you don't feel uncomfortable
about showing your skin, right?

504
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,280
The viewers will be uncomfortable.

505
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,480
I won't feel uncomfortable.

506
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,650
- That's why you can't.
- Come on.

507
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,850
I did a character called Tazzang
a long time ago.

508
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,080
- Right.
- You can watch the old videos.

509
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,890
I was completely shirtless
for the character.

510
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,950
- I liked your physique then.
- Really?

511
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,660
- I'll pick Kim Accidentally.
- Okay.

512
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,230
- I like the age for this one.
- Kim Accidentally.

513
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,860
- You must pick a younger age.
- It's the age.

514
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,830
- This is cute.
- Yes. You can put that on.

515
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,930
- It's cute.
- Yes.

516
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,600
- You look cool.
- This is a cute hat.

517
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,730
(Is that so?)

518
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,970
- Hey.
- What's wrong with my face?

519
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,440
- I wonder why.
- Your face...

520
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,240
- What's wrong with my face?
- You always have that dilemma.

521
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,970
- Pick that one. It's better.
- Who's next? DinDin.

522
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,140
- This special is for Jong Min.
- Yes.

523
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,210
I don't think
it will be a bad idea...

524
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,750
for him to go back
to the first shoot.

525
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,950
I applaud your novel idea.

526
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,320
- But that one is too old.
- Yes.

527
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,450
Given how big the age difference is,
I'm sure...

528
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,020
- I can turn the tables around...
- You can turn the tables around.

529
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,590
- in the next game.
- That's totally doable.

530
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,760
So Jong Min should go back
to the first shoot.

531
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,030
- That will look neat.
- Yes, it will be meaningful.

532
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,730
- You're so cool.
- I'll go with Kim Tteutto.

533
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,530
- Okay.
- No way.

534
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,930
That's so cool. Nice.

535
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,300
- My gosh.
- It's a special celebrating you.

536
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,600
- Going back to the first shoot...
- Yes.

537
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,970
- will look nice.
- The small giant.

538
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,270
I'm sure I can make up for this...

539
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,340
- in the later game.
- Yes.

540
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,340
- You can.
- It's only the first game.
- Right.
- Of course.

541
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,610
Great. Everyone,
let's go and get changed now.

542
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,610
Okay.

543
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,980
(The members will transform
into Jong Min.)

544
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,050
(How will 6 Jong Mins look?)

545
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,050
(Let us present 6 Jong Mins
even Kim Jong Min approved of.)

546
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,920
(Kim First Shoot, Age 29)

547
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,290
Possible.

548
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,860
What?

549
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,330
(Kim Accidentally, Age 25)

550
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,730
Hello.

551
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,670
I'm Kim Public Service Worker
from the courthouse.

552
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,700
(And at the height
of bold fashion...)

553
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,570
(Looking sensual)

554
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,640
Gosh, this feels like
the Blue Dragon Film Awards.

555
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,910
He reminds me of Kim Hye Soo.

556
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,610
(His move captivates
the hearts of women.)

557
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,550
- I really hate Joon for this.
- So...

558
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,220
(To top it off,
he gives off an alluring gaze.)

559
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,390
(Kim Poison, Age 20)

560
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,690
- My gosh.
- It's the history of Jong Min.

561
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,990
Jong Min of 2 Days and 1 Night.

562
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,490
(Perfect transformations
into 6 Jong Mins)

563
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,530
Jong Min.

564
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,730
- Yes?
- Yes?

565
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,830
Do you mean me?

566
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,170
- Me?
- It wasn't me.

567
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,300
I didn't eat it.

568
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,740
Jong Min.

569
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,640
(There he goes again.)

570
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,970
Did you call me?

571
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,980
(Come on, guys.)

572
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,110
- You're mocking me at this point.
- We're filming now.

573
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,010
(They're not mocking him.
They've channeled him.)

574
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,620
I saw a photo booth here.

575
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,920
- Shall we take one in our outfits?
- Let's take one.

576
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
- Yes.
- Let's go.

577
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,420
I have a song called "Life4Cuts."

578
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,160
- Can you sing it?
- Use it as background music.

579
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,190
("Life4Cuts" by DinDin)

580
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,930
(Sure, we will.)

581
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,290
(Six men enter the booth.)

582
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,690
- Hurry up.
- Hurry.

583
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,330
Look at the camera here.

584
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,400
Hey, it's too tight in here.

585
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,900
Se Yoon is blocking the camera.

586
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,200
- Move to the side.
- We're good.

587
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,770
- Don't do that.
- Okay.

588
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,910
(Looking friendly in the photo)

589
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,640
(Looking playful in the photo)

590
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,210
Let's make ugly faces
except for Jong Min.

591
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,280
- Yes.
- Sure.

592
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,680
So Jong Min stands out.

593
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,980
(Crumpled)

594
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,010
(Trying their best to look ugly)

595
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,150
(Thanks to the 5 Jong Mins,)

596
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,720
(Jong Min looks handsome.)

597
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,290
(Traveling Geoje with Jong Mins)

598
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,760
Shall we go? Let's go, Jong Min.

599
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,460
It's a jet boat.

600
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,330
My gosh. If we ride the jet boat
in this outfit...

601
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,330
- Gosh, I'm cold.
- Are we going to ride that?

602
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,070
- We'll ride it? But it's cold.
- It's cold.

603
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,600
- That's really fast.
- It's faster than you think.

604
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,770
- You could vomit.
- I've tried that.

605
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,340
We're going to ride that?

606
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,610
- Okay.
- Now that you made some memories,

607
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,380
you'll enjoy the beautiful scenery
of Haegeum Islets,

608
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,010
nicknamed Mount Kumgang...

609
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,410
among the oceans.

610
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,580
- Haegeum Islets.
- We'll ride a jet boat...

611
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,780
to Haegeum Islets?

612
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,050
Yes.
It's known for its thrilling rides.

613
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,750
We'll set sail to the ocean
on a jet boat.

614
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,060
- But you can't just ride the boat.
- Right, not all of us should.

615
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,060
You'll have a pedometer
on your head.

616
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,930
- What?
- We'll check the number...

617
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,460
on your pedometer after the tour.

618
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,760
Then we'll drop the last digit
of your number,

619
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,830
find the difference from
the first-place member's number,

620
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,300
- and add that to your age.
- What did you say?

621
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,500
- What?
- What?

622
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
- What?
- What?

623
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,940
- What?
- Listen.

624
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,770
- What do you mean?
- You'll have a pedometer on.

625
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,310
It's complicated, right? Listen.

626
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,280
For example, the number
for the member in 1st place is 97.

627
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
- The member in 2nd place was 135.
- Okay.

628
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,120
Drop 7 from 97. Drop 5 from 135.

629
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,750
- Then...
- Subtract 9 from 13.

630
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,650
we'll subtract 9 from 13.

631
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,420
Then you'll gain four years.

632
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,160
- Then you could end up...
- But...

633
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,460
- gaining 8 or 9 years.
- So...

634
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,730
- It could be more than that.
- It sounds like...

635
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,930
- It could be more?
- Yes.

636
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,230
So this is it.

637
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,700
We have to make sure
our pedometer stays still.

638
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,000
- You just have to win first place.
- Right.

639
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,800
- That's all we need to know.
- That's it.

640
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,900
- But... Really?
- Okay.

641
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,540
- I...
- Just keep the pedometer still.

642
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,440
We just have to engage our core
and stay still. Right?

643
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,910
Then can't you guess
how rocky the ride will be?

644
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,750
Everyone, let's go
and get on the jet boat.

645
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,910
- Okay.
- I got it.

646
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,650
- Let's go. Have a safe ride!
- This is so scary.

647
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,280
We can't press on it
after we come back, right?

648
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,350
- Don't touch it now.
- Okay.

649
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,420
- We already started.
- Let's go.

650
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,420
- We already started.
- Okay.

651
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,620
- Okay. Thank you.
- I get motion sickness easily, sir.

652
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,160
Sir, I don't feel good!

653
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,560
Why are you guys suddenly so chatty?

654
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,260
- I feel nauseous.
- You all seem to have excuses.

655
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,900
Starting now, I won't talk or move.

656
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,800
We'll be back!

657
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,500
My gosh, I feel nauseous.

658
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,840
Let's go!

659
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,000
I won't talk.

660
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,940
This is an expensive ride.
Let's enjoy it.

661
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,880
(Grabbing tightly)

662
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,510
- I won't talk.
- So we should try not to move.

663
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,580
Right, we shouldn't move.

664
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,450
(Minimizing movements
will be the key to victory.)

665
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,380
(This is doable.)

666
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,220
(Entering the high-speed section)

667
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,250
Oh, no.

668
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,120
(Speeding up)

669
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,820
- Oh, no. My arms are moving first.
- My gosh, it's starting.

670
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,790
(Gripping tightly)

671
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,330
Oh, no.

672
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,230
(Screaming)

673
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,170
(Turning the boat
without any hesitation)

674
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:42,210
(The numbers go up
as the boat moves up and down.)

675
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,320
(Bouncing)

676
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,820
(The pedometer count goes up
due to the ruthless movements.)

677
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,130
That's salty.
Gosh, the water is salty.

678
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,570
My gosh, I might vomit.

679
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,730
(Let me wipe my face.)

680
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
(Splashing)

681
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,770
(Dear me)

682
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,340
(Meanwhile, Kim Tteutto
hangs in there without moving.)

683
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,810
(Kim Possible isn't budging either.)

684
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,810
(Screaming)

685
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,110
That's salty.

686
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,310
(This guy keeps shrieking out loud.)

687
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,710
(The jet boat speeds off
in a matter of seconds.)

688
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,720
This is fun.

689
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
I like it.

690
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,230
(Kim Poison slowly gets up.)

691
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,330
(He's going to match his movement
to the boat's.)

692
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,200
(The boat and I will become one.)

693
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,870
Hey, how far are we?
We've come too far.

694
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,300
Hey, we've come too far.

695
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,370
Where are we?

696
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,970
- There it is.
- Where are we?

697
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,410
There's Haegeum Islets!

698
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,680
That's right.

699
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,110
- How beautiful.
- I see Haegeum Islets over there!

700
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,580
(Geoje Haegeum Islets welcome them
with a magnificent grandeur.)

701
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,980
My gosh, the water is salty.

702
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,420
(Absorbing the shock)

703
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,490
How beautiful.

704
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,790
They're indeed cool.

705
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,130
- Hey, it's almost an island.
- Like a desert island.

706
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,170
This is so cool.

707
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,600
(Geoje Haegeum Islets)

708
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,700
A desert island. How cool.

709
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,370
The island you are seeing now is...

710
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,240
- considered a scenic spot in Korea.
- Okay.

711
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,580
It's Mount Kumgang of the oceans.

712
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,010
It's called
the Geoje Haegeum Islets.

713
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,850
Mount Kumgang of the oceans,
Haegeum Islets.

714
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,450
(The most famous view
of Hallyeohaesang National Park)

715
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,690
(They enter a cave.)

716
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,660
(We'll go in there?)

717
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,230
(Into the Haegeum Islets)

718
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,830
(Everyone is amazed.)

719
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,830
What's this?

720
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,600
My gosh. We can come in here...

721
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,830
- because we're on a boat.
- This is amazing.

722
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,930
(It feels as if they're sucked
into a mystical world.)

723
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,600
My gosh. This place is amazing.

724
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,810
(They can't look away
from this magical scenery.)

725
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,370
Mount Kumgang of the oceans.

726
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,980
Haegeum Islets.

727
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,680
(Amazed)

728
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,180
- Great.
- My gosh.

729
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,450
- Gosh, look at this.
- Goodness, how beautiful.

730
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,550
I can't believe this.

731
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,820
This is so cool.

732
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,190
(6 Jong Mins...)

733
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,920
(are mesmerized by the scenery
of the steep rocky cliffs.)

734
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,490
- Great.
- My gosh, this is amazing.

735
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,490
- Oh, my.
- This is so nice.

736
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,060
(They're mesmerized by the scenery
of the steep rocky cliffs.)

737
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,530
- This is great.
- My goodness.

738
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,770
Gosh, look at this.
I can't believe this.

739
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,570
- This is so cool.
- All right, look up.

740
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,640
If you try to look at the view,

741
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,670
- the count will go up.
- My gosh.

742
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,970
- Don't look up.
- What?

743
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,470
- The count will go up if you do.
- My gosh. Hey.

744
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,640
When these four islands
came together,

745
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,050
the light was reflected
in the shape of a cross.

746
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,380
So it's called the Cross Cave.

747
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,450
My gosh, the view is unbelievable.

748
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,820
(Cross Cave)

749
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,120
(It's a sea cave
that was formed by wave erosion.)

750
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,320
(It's known as the highlight
of Geoje Haegeum Islets.)

751
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
My gosh, the view is unbelievable.

752
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,220
- The count will go up if you look.
- Hey, you'll miss out on this?

753
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,220
- Don't look.
- Hey.

754
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,320
- You should sacrifice the count.
- If you look up,

755
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,860
- the count will go up.
- You must look at the view.

756
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,690
How can you miss out on this?
You ought to enjoy the view.

757
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,500
The view will be amazing. Look up.

758
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,230
- The Cross Cave. My gosh.
- I won't look up.

759
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,230
(I won't look up.)

760
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,930
Gosh, this is so cool.

761
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,270
- Does it look cool?
- You'll miss out on this? No way.

762
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,940
But I feel dizzy.
Sir, I'm feeling very dizzy now.

763
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,780
Why are we turning?

764
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,310
(Spinning)

765
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,150
I want to go inside the cave.

766
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,610
- Inside there?
- Yes.

767
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,180
We'll go back now.

768
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
Okay.

769
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,190
(Bummed out)

770
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,190
Look.

771
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,320
(The jet boat comes out
of Cross Cave.)

772
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,320
Hold on tight.

773
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,460
- Okay.
- Hold on tight.

774
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,890
- Hold on tight.
- He told us to hold on tight.

775
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,890
What?

776
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,090
- We're going to turn.
- We're going to turn.

777
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,100
- We're going to turn.
- We're turning.

778
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,560
We're going to turn. Hold on tight.

779
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,700
We didn't go far yet.

780
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,870
- We should go far.
- Three,

781
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,870
- two, one.
- We're going to turn.

782
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,010
(A sudden turn of 360 degrees)

783
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,080
(Resist)

784
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,780
(Dizzy)

785
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,950
It's like a performance.

786
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,150
The numbers are high.

787
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,720
Yours is no joke.

788
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,920
(Shocked by the high number)

789
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,020
What's my number?

790
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,390
Goodness.

791
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,590
Your number is high.

792
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,260
- Take a look.
- Let me see yours.

793
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,700
Why is his number missing?

794
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,730
- What?
- Let me see.

795
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,070
- What's your number?
- Let me see.

796
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,470
Something is wrong with his.

797
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,370
I was holding on like this.

798
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,840
I was holding on too.

799
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,670
Let's do an interim check.

800
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,210
What?

801
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,410
Sae Ho's number is 540.

802
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,010
Five hundred and forty?

803
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,940
- Se Yoon's number is 503.
- Gosh.

804
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,580
- Joon.
- Is it 745?

805
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,980
Joon's number is 748.

806
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,020
- Is this correct?
- DinDin's number is 30.

807
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,090
- Okay.
- What?

808
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,220
- What?
- You have to stay...

809
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,090
- like this.
- Seon Ho's number is 416.

810
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,990
- You have no other choice.
- Jong Min's number is 395.

811
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,890
- Why is mine so high?
- You cheated.

812
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,160
How is your number 30?

813
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,330
I held on like this.

814
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,800
- Isn't it wrong?
- I think it's wrong.

815
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,400
No way.

816
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,530
With my shoulders...

817
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,900
DinDin pressed down his head...

818
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,530
- like this.
- Listen.

819
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,770
I held on like this.

820
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,910
(After reviewing the video
while editing)

821
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,110
(He didn't break any rules.)

822
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,310
Can you move?

823
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,480
- Let's see you move.
- Bang your head.

824
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
Let's see if it increases.

825
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,680
Let me see.

826
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,020
- It went up.
- It's 32.

827
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,020
It goes up.

828
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,490
I've been resisting like this.

829
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,990
- Isn't something wrong with it?
- I should just enjoy the ride.

830
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,720
I've been
in a horse riding position.

831
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,820
There it is.

832
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,430
(You should ride the boat,
not a horse.)

833
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,190
All right.

834
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,360
(The last step is
a high speed section.)

835
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,600
(They must resist until the end
to get less old.)

836
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,700
I hear the number rising.

837
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,900
It goes up even if I stay still.

838
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,410
(He fixes his posture
to turn the tables.)

839
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,810
(What will be the final result
of the age competition?)

840
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,380
(To the dock)

841
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,610
(Going straight at high speed)

842
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,750
(Screaming)

843
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,990
(Groaning)

844
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,360
He's so loud.

845
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,420
That's terrible.

846
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,590
Mister, can you be quiet?

847
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,760
That's enough already.

848
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,230
- We're here.
- We're here.

849
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,600
It's so salty.

850
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,570
(They arrive at the dock
in an instant.)

851
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,270
Joon is...

852
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,440
- Joon is...
- Is he sleeping?

853
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,410
What do we do about Joon?

854
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,210
Joon.

855
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,580
(Let me get off now.)

856
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,480
(Let me get off now.)

857
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,150
You need to come up here to finish.

858
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,220
Thank you.

859
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,420
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

860
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,620
What's this?

861
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,890
(They try to get off
as gently as possible.)

862
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,590
(Swaying)

863
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,020
This is the hardest.

864
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,590
(I'm so curious.)

865
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,930
It was hard.

866
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,060
(What will be the number
on Six Jong Mins' pedometer?)

867
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,300
Once you step...

868
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,960
on this line, you're in.

869
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,000
Okay.

870
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You're in.

871
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,540
Thank you.

872
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,000
It's 1,496.

873
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,070
(Kim First Shoot Jong Min: 1,496)

874
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,070
Sae Ho.

875
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,980
- It's 1,380.
- I'm doomed.

876
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,210
It's quite high.

877
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,610
- Se Yoon.
- It's entangled.

878
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,210
- It's 1,424.
- It's entangled.

879
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,550
Seon Ho's number is 1,069.

880
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,980
What? Really?

881
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
Actually...

882
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,490
- DinDin's number is 130.
- I didn't move at all.

883
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,590
- What?
- It's 130.

884
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,690
I stayed like this.

885
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,920
It's random.

886
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,030
Some pedometers are less sensitive.

887
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,030
Right.

888
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,300
This one reacts
even if I stay still.

889
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,430
And Joon.

890
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,670
It's 1,595.

891
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,730
(Kim Poison Joon: 1,595)

892
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,830
Goodness.

893
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,170
(Kim Poison Joon: 1,595)

894
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:50,570
(The result of a tour
around Haegeum Islets)

895
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,440
Joon, did you try to resist?

896
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,150
- I tried to be smart.
- Okay.

897
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,580
I was holding
a horse riding position.

898
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,310
- Joon was...
- Isn't this the position?

899
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,850
Joon held up his buttocks
during the ride.

900
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,920
When there was a thump,

901
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,250
I tried to move with the boat.

902
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,420
That doesn't work.

903
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,990
When you're in a racing car...

904
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,160
You were just lucky.

905
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,390
Everyone pushed during the ride.

906
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,690
Just consider yourself lucky.

907
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,260
If it's okay with DinDin,

908
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,930
why don't we say
his number is 1,000?

909
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,070
That's fine by me.

910
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,070
(To be fair,
we count DinDin's as 1,000.)

911
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,400
(After the subtraction with
the last two digits removed)

912
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
(Kim Possible gets 6 more years.)

913
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,870
Here's your current age.

914
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,970
Your current age.

915
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,870
DinDin is 38 years old.

916
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,380
Seon Ho is 40 years old.

917
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,780
Seon Ho did a good job.

918
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,250
- I did a good job.
- Sae Ho is 63 years.

919
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,250
I didn't do so badly.

920
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,780
Se Yoon is 73 years old.

921
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,950
Jong Min is 78 years old.

922
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,720
Joon is 79 years old.

923
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,650
(He got 59 more years.)

924
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,290
(He made a bold decision
to win 1st place.)

925
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,790
- We'll move now.
- Okay.

926
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,930
Let's move to the next location.

927
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,930
- Okay.
- Okay.

928
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,600
Let's take the boat.

929
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,630
- Shall we take the boat?
- Yes.

930
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,670
No way.

931
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,700
- Let's go.
- This isn't easy.

932
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,170
I'm hungry from being seasick.

933
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,810
Who is the eldest?

934
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,840
The 70-year-olds.

935
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,110
- Is it you?
- It's me.

936
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,480
(Joon became the eldest
from being the youngest.)

937
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,580
The tables got turned at once.

938
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,250
You put on that outfit
to win first place.

939
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,280
I feel dejected.

940
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,420
Do you know...

941
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,280
what Director Joo asked
as soon as we got off the boat?

942
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,920
"Joon, did you make
an effort at least?"

943
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,960
That's what he asked.

944
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,560
- You only care about the result.
- I worked very hard.

945
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,860
You don't care
about the process at all.

946
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,390
- The process...
- If you watch the process...

947
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,130
Directors never look at the process.

948
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,700
It's the same for comedians.

949
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,200
They say that the script is good...

950
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,600
only when it's funny.

951
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,100
No matter how hard you work,
if it's not funny,

952
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,370
they'll say that
you wasted your time.

953
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,310
The directors don't care
about the process.

954
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,410
It's so unfair.

955
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,510
- Will we eat a lot in the evening?
- When will we eat a lot?

956
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,640
Tell us when we're eating a lot...

957
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,650
- to keep up our strength.
- Right.

958
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,210
- You will be eating a lot...
- We need to eat.

959
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,550
very soon.

960
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,550
Soon?

961
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,580
- It won't be dinner.
- It won't be dinner.

962
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,290
They won't give us a big dinner?

963
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,950
- For the night...
- It means...

964
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,720
that the day won't end with a feast.

965
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,190
- Right.
- They'll give us food beforehand.

966
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,490
They must be planning to drink...

967
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,500
- in the evening.
- Right.

968
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,530
You're talkative
even though you're old.

969
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,030
Even though he's old?

970
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,070
(Kim Public Service Worker
had forgotten his age.)

971
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,470
Me?

972
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,600
(Feigning innocence)

973
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,370
- I have a question.
- Yes?

974
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,070
I wanted to mimic him,

975
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,610
so I tried.

976
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,180
You tend to act...

977
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,210
like Shin Hyun Joon
from "Barefoot Ki Bong."

978
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,120
"Me... Me?" Like this.

979
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,120
That's not your character, is it?

980
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,450
- No, it's not.
- I mean...

981
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,790
I was curious.

982
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,220
This is what I noticed in Jong Min.

983
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,360
The words shouldn't be
close together.

984
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,630
Jong Min always takes a breath.

985
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,160
- Really?
- He is thinking.

986
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,200
(He's busy moving his head.)

987
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,500
(Jong Min also stutters.)

988
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,600
When someone asks him something,

989
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,670
he doesn't answer right away.

990
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,840
"Of course."

991
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,540
He's right.

992
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,640
There's always...

993
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
a short pause.

994
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,950
- "Of course."
- He thinks about it.

995
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,350
"Would you like to do it?"

996
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,820
"No."

997
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,750
- I see.
- "No."

998
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,590
- Right away...
- You need to take a breath.

999
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,690
(He clearly didn't understand.)

1000
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,360
- Sae Ho and I...
- Like this?

1001
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,820
This is it.

1002
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,130
- "No."
- Right away...

1003
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,760
I understand Jong Min perfectly.

1004
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,930
I'm the same.

1005
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,000
- Since I'm in a hurry,
- When you want to talk...

1006
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,870
- no words come out.
- Right.

1007
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,000
I have a lot to say.

1008
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,910
"Until... Until the East Sea..."

1009
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,740
This is what happens. Right?

1010
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,870
- He's good.
- That's a good one.

1011
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,610
- You're right.
- I just learned.

1012
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,210
(He understood.)

1013
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,310
For example,

1014
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,650
"The... The East Sea
and Mount Baekdu..."

1015
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,320
Isn't this right?

1016
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,920
(Although he's terrible at it,
he's excited.)

1017
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,420
You must have a lot to say.

1018
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,050
Sae Ho will unwind a lot today.

1019
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,860
I don't know well enough,
so I'm practicing.

1020
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,130
What about when you drink
sand lance sauce?

1021
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,630
Your blood vessels pop out
on your neck.

1022
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,000
All of them must pop out.

1023
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,260
They must pop out.

1024
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,500
(Shouting)

1025
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,330
(Shouting)

1026
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,970
- You have to say "tta?"
- Tta.

1027
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,000
(Sand lance equals "tta.")

1028
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,470
Like warm Americano.

1029
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,470
- "Tta!"
- That's it.

1030
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,010
Do I have to imagine
a hot potato in my mouth?

1031
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,340
Gosh, it's hot.

1032
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,780
(Suddenly, he's showing off
his personal talent.)

1033
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,110
- Like this?
- You're overdoing it.

1034
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,620
(What's not is not.)

1035
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,350
What are you doing?

1036
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,390
If you could go back in time,
when would it be?

1037
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,260
A time you want to go back to.

1038
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,590
Whenever it may be,
I want to go back in time.

1039
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,360
However,

1040
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,790
I'd like to go back
to Poison's time.

1041
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,000
(He has the fondest memory
of Poison.)

1042
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,060
Why?

1043
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,130
Is it okay even if
your wife doesn't exist?

1044
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,970
I'll meet her again anyway.

1045
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,340
Back then, you weren't
as competent as you are now.

1046
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,810
That's why I felt more anxious.

1047
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,580
Mentally?

1048
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,210
Yes, I was young and anxious.

1049
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,050
Time passes by anyway.

1050
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,550
- I was young.
- Right.

1051
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,820
Do you want to go back to
when you worked in public service?

1052
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,890
When I worked in public service?

1053
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:32,990
- I want to go back.
- Really?

1054
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,390
I want to go back to that time
and enjoy the slump.

1055
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,960
- You want to enjoy it?
- I felt so anxious.

1056
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,000
- Right.
- The slump made me anxious.

1057
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,170
- Wasn't it a dark age of your life?
- It was.

1058
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,100
(Jong Min feels confident about
enjoying his past full of anxiety.)

1059
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,140
Now, we're Six Jong Mins.

1060
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,140
Right.

1061
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,470
It was impossible to predict
Jong Min's life.

1062
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,040
He was a dancer.

1063
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,240
Suddenly, he sang the theme song
for "One Piece."

1064
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,880
After being on 2 Days and 1 Night,

1065
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,180
he worked in public service.

1066
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,220
- Right.
- After being Kim Possible,

1067
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,350
he suddenly became Kim Tteutto.

1068
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,290
- Then he became who he is now.
- Right.

1069
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,720
- His life is...
- It's amazing.

1070
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,960
- totally unpredictable.
- Perhaps...

1071
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,230
(When their chat dies down...)

1072
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,360
- It's Haenyeo's House.
- We're here to eat.

1073
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,960
What? Are we here to eat?

1074
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,900
Will they give us seafood?

1075
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,670
We don't have to catch it ourselves,
do we?

1076
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,130
We have to catch it ourselves?

1077
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,770
We promised to make you eat
to your heart's content.

1078
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,770
It's a promise.

1079
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,340
Will we go fishing after eating?

1080
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,980
(Take a look before eating.)

1081
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,110
It's so beautiful here.

1082
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,480
- How can it be so beautiful?
- Goodness.

1083
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,020
It's pretty here.

1084
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,720
Sae Ho is here to have fun.

1085
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,120
Is this mongdol?

1086
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,950
Where do these stones come from?

1087
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,790
Are these stones called mongdol?

1088
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,820
- The stones look nice.
- Mongdol.

1089
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,460
I love the sound
when we walk on them.

1090
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,430
- It's like ASMR.
- The stones...

1091
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,760
- They were shaped naturally.
- I love the sound.

1092
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
- Look at this.
- Mongdol...

1093
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,270
(They enjoy ricocheting
in their own way.)

1094
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,730
One, two.

1095
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,540
- Wait a minute.
- The stones look pretty.

1096
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,570
(He's just in love with the stones.)

1097
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,270
Six Jong Mins,
let's take a photo together.

1098
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,680
(Director Joo is
today's photographer.)

1099
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,110
- Can you move back a little?
- Move back.

1100
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,880
- That's good.
- You won't get a good angle.

1101
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,720
- He seems too close to us.
- What?

1102
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,250
- You're too close.
- You're too close.

1103
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,820
- I got wet.
- Go back a little more.

1104
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,260
One, two, three.

1105
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,320
(They smile automatically
thanks to Director Joo.)

1106
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,160
(At Mongdol Beach)

1107
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,330
(Which one is real Jong Min?)

1108
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,900
- I'm hungry.
- Let's go and eat.

1109
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
(Let's go and eat
to our heart's content.)

1110
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,740
(What will be today's lunch
for the hungry ones?)

1111
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,900
What's this?

1112
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,210
(Exclaiming)

1113
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,840
It's for us. We get to binge.

1114
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,040
It's all mine.

1115
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,340
What is it?

1116
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,810
What is it?

1117
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,250
(Last week)

1118
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,320
(The result of fasting
versus binging game)

1119
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,990
(Joon earned it for the team.)

1120
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,790
(A rare chance to binge)

1121
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,490
(So we prepared...)

1122
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,000
(16 different dishes.)

1123
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,570
(Provided as much as they want)

1124
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,600
(A plentiful meal for binging)

1125
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,340
But it's very disappointing.

1126
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,410
Why?

1127
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,870
What's disappointing about it?

1128
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,180
- Weren't you giving us everything?
- Hold on.

1129
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,910
- What's this?
- The dish is so small.

1130
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,650
- Is this some kind of game?
- Is it a game?

1131
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,050
This isn't binging that we imagined.

1132
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,320
Is it not?

1133
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,120
(Only 2 pieces on 1 plate?)

1134
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,490
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

1135
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,090
- Chan Sung, let's go.
- Let's go.

1136
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,760
Get the car ready.

1137
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,000
- Let's go to a tasty restaurant.
- I mean...

1138
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,630
The way you keep your promises
keeps getting worse.

1139
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,970
Right. You promised to give
enough to satisfy us.

1140
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,200
- For binging, this is...
- This isn't binging.

1141
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,800
Is this binging?

1142
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,340
(No way.)

1143
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,870
We'll go 150km forward.

1144
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,940
There's a lot of food.

1145
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,180
You should've given us a huge meal.

1146
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,350
- These are so small.
- Is it not enough?

1147
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,150
- Director, I'll work hard.
- Right.

1148
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,690
I'm happy with it.

1149
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,720
- We should eat when it's hot.
- You'd better eat.

1150
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,420
- Shall we sit down?
- Yes.

1151
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,030
Let's see what he says.
There must be more.

1152
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,860
There must be something else.

1153
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,160
When Se Yoon is hungry,
he can eat all of it.

1154
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,000
Let's hear what he has to say.

1155
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,470
- Let's hear it.
- Start the car.

1156
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,870
Based on the result
of your last Morning Mission,

1157
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,500
we promised to let you binge...

1158
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,170
once during the shoot.

1159
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,110
- Yes.
- So we prepared...

1160
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,780
a generous all-you-can-eat meal.

1161
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,850
You can choose what you'd like
and eat as much as you want.

1162
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,450
However, there's one rule.

1163
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,050
Please bring it.

1164
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,020
(Curious)

1165
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,060
(Act Your Age Buffet)

1166
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,120
- What?
- What are you doing?

1167
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,990
- What's on the plates?
- What on earth is this?

1168
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,230
(Oh, come on.)

1169
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,930
(What's this?)

1170
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,600
Age is assigned
to every plate color.

1171
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,570
(Red plates, 20 years)

1172
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,910
(Yellow plates, 10 years)

1173
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,710
(Green plates, 5 years)

1174
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,010
(Blue plates, 1 year)

1175
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,780
There's a negative ten.

1176
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,420
(Brown plates, negative 10 years)

1177
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,320
(As much as they eat,)

1178
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,250
(they get older.)

1179
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,560
- Don't you think this is harsh?
- What's wrong?

1180
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,030
I'm 79 years old.

1181
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,030
How can I eat?

1182
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,700
If it's negative ten years,
can't we eat them endlessly?

1183
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,830
- Right.
- After that, we can eat the rest.

1184
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,730
- It's skate.
- Skate and sophora root tea.

1185
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,970
It's skate snout.

1186
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,610
Joon, don't you like skate?

1187
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,210
Skate is negative years?

1188
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,280
- Skate makes you younger.
- Seriously?

1189
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,880
Those who like skate have
an advantage.

1190
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,510
- I like skate.
- Let's take a look.

1191
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,980
- I can eat that. Give it to me.
- This is...

1192
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,450
It's my favorite.
I even buy skate...

1193
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,880
- at a convenience store.
- I can eat that.

1194
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,990
Can you eat it without chojang?

1195
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,820
I can eat this, but we must eat it
without chojang.

1196
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,790
It's rotten.

1197
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,220
(The strong smell of skate
penetrates the nose.)

1198
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,460
It's totally rotten.

1199
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,830
(It isn't easy.)

1200
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,160
What is this?

1201
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,830
- What's this?
- What's this?

1202
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,530
It's skate snout.
It has the strongest flavor.

1203
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,640
It's common sense to think
that time is money.

1204
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,210
How can eating chicken
make you 20 years older?

1205
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,680
- What's this?
- This is too harsh.

1206
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,810
Should I just turn 300 years old?

1207
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,910
- Are you sure?
- If we eat...

1208
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,250
fried chicken, LA galbi,
and braised kimchi with pork,

1209
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,050
we will gain 60 years.

1210
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,190
I'm just going to eat anyway.

1211
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,920
Can we eat what makes us...

1212
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,190
ten years younger only once?

1213
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,690
No.

1214
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,790
Can I drink sophora root tea
three times in a row?

1215
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,660
If you do that,

1216
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,830
you'll lose your appetite.

1217
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,160
I want to lose my appetite.

1218
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,400
- You do?
- Yes.

1219
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,800
Everyone, you can eat
as much as you want.

1220
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,200
(They have a lot to say,
but they won't say it.)

1221
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,910
You gain ten years
from drinking Coke?

1222
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,540
(The meal starts.)

1223
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,140
You gain ten years
from drinking Coke.

1224
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,980
I'll start with sophora root tea.

1225
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,380
There's so much food.

1226
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,250
- Here I go.
- Can we start?

1227
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,890
We'll calculate your age at the end.
Help yourselves.

1228
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,090
(After thinking, Joon...)

1229
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,320
This is delicious.

1230
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,890
Eating skate with rice...

1231
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,220
I should eat some rice.

1232
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,090
Give me a plate of skate.

1233
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,700
I'll start with skate
and sophora root tea.

1234
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,560
You're impressive.

1235
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,670
(Jong Min also starts
with sophora root tea.)

1236
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,200
What's sophora root tea?

1237
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,570
- Sophora root tea...
- It's bitter.

1238
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,040
- Is it seriously bitter?
- Try it.

1239
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,140
(Joon also gets sophora root tea.)

1240
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,080
Everyone, eat a lot
of delicious food.

1241
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,980
Our cook prepared it for you.

1242
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,410
(Drinking sophora root tea
in one go)

1243
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,450
Seriously?

1244
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,850
(It's more painful to watch them.)

1245
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,980
What are they doing?

1246
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,120
- One more glass.
- One more.

1247
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,820
One more glass.

1248
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,360
- It's sophora root tea.
- Look at the extract at the bottom.

1249
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,330
Keep going. I'm sorry,
but you need to drink more.

1250
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,560
- No.
- No way.

1251
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,800
(Trembling)

1252
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,200
Why are you doing this to me?

1253
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,500
Playing the game is important,

1254
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,800
but I want to taste the cook's food.

1255
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,470
(20 years)

1256
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,810
(1 year)

1257
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,570
(10 years)

1258
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,040
Hey, we should eat this.

1259
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,240
Is there spicy fried chicken?

1260
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,850
(5 years)

1261
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,880
Why aren't you eating?

1262
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,550
That's strange.

1263
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,490
(He's the only one happy
about making choices.)

1264
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,550
Seriously.

1265
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,190
I'll eat first.

1266
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,430
I'll start.

1267
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,500
(Getting 36 years older
without thinking)

1268
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,430
- Joon, eat a lot.
- Enjoy your food.

1269
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,670
What did you take?

1270
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,900
Skate and sophora root tea.

1271
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,670
(He takes a bite of skate
that he likes.)

1272
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,610
Joon, is the skate snout okay?

1273
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,610
(It's not okay.)

1274
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,240
Does the skate taste okay?

1275
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,980
You said that you like it.

1276
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,310
- You buy it at convenience stores.
- What's wrong?

1277
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,180
Are you eating skate with rice?

1278
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,220
(Laughing)

1279
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,820
Even I can eat skate
from convenience stores.

1280
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,990
The snout? Oh, gosh!

1281
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,190
(Disgusted)

1282
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,260
You don't have to finish.
You can give up.

1283
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,260
- The snout is...
- Gosh.

1284
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,100
It's really good.

1285
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,530
(He returns the sophora root tea.)

1286
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,400
Why aren't you drinking
sophora root tea?

1287
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,330
(I can't do this.)

1288
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,900
The black knight is coming.

1289
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,500
The skate snout is intense.

1290
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,370
I can eat every part
except for the snout.

1291
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,880
(Maybe there wasn't skate snout
at the convenience store.)

1292
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,510
It's so good.

1293
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,380
Refill dishes that are gone.

1294
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,520
(Happy)

1295
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,490
(Should I eat this or not?)

1296
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,290
I give up. I'll just get older.

1297
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,060
You can get older after eating.

1298
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,860
(DinDin decides to binge too.)

1299
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,230
DinDin brought fried chicken.

1300
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,700
He got 60 years.

1301
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,230
(60 more years at once)

1302
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,370
- He's binging.
- Let's eat.

1303
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,170
(10 years, 10 years)

1304
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,540
What's wrong with DinDin?

1305
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,710
- What's wrong with him?
- Hey.

1306
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,340
DinDin is binging.

1307
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,380
(Cold sashimi soup
and monkfish soup)

1308
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,410
Really? What are you doing?

1309
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,450
(Do I know you?)

1310
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,620
Eighty. Ninety.

1311
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,790
(He brought a generous portion.)

1312
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,620
These will make me 101 years older.

1313
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,760
You're impressive. Are you serious?

1314
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,530
Mister, there isn't any rice.

1315
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,190
- There's no more rice.
- The skate is well fermented.

1316
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,300
- Give us more rice.
- Refill dishes that are gone.

1317
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,360
(Bring us more rice
and other dishes.)

1318
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,500
- I'll just get 300 years older.
- Should I just eat too?

1319
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,100
- Just eat.
- All right.

1320
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,070
Yes, this monkfish bulgogi is
to die for.

1321
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,440
- Is the bulgogi good?
- It's good.

1322
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,640
I should eat some bulgogi.

1323
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,240
The monkfish bulgogi is
very delicious.

1324
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,510
- Really?
- Yes. You must try it.

1325
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,250
Jong Min, eat good food
like japchae.

1326
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,850
Let me get ten years younger first.

1327
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,850
After drinking two glasses
of sophora root tea at once,

1328
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,920
- I...
- Didn't it remove your appetite?

1329
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,120
I don't crave anything.

1330
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,630
I don't know anymore.

1331
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,930
I'll do well later.

1332
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,330
(I'm hungry, so I'll eat more.)

1333
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,370
I'll take some galbi...

1334
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,170
and cold sashimi soup.

1335
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,200
(He might eat all the dishes.)

1336
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,110
(Kim Public Service Worker is
getting old fast.)

1337
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,310
I don't care anymore.

1338
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,440
Everyone, you can worry
about it later.

1339
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,710
- Just eat for now.
- Right.

1340
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,110
- If you starve,
- Hey.

1341
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,680
- you won't perform so well.
- Right.

1342
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,420
- You should eat a lot now.
- We should eat good food.

1343
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,920
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

1344
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,420
I had one.

1345
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,660
Let me take some monkfish bulgogi
and japchae.

1346
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,760
(Sae Ho gets monkfish bulgogi
and japchae.)

1347
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,090
(Joon takes LA galbi.)

1348
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,630
(Seon Ho gets cold sashimi soup
and rice.)

1349
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,830
(Food at the seaside buffet is
selling like hot cakes.)

1350
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,170
(This is what you call
eating to your heart's content.)

1351
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,900
The monkfish bulgogi is so good.

1352
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,740
This monkfish bulgogi is
really good.

1353
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,540
I like monkfish soup. It's awesome.

1354
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,680
It's amazing. It's so tender.

1355
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,010
As for monkfish bulgogi
and monkfish soup,

1356
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,820
we got them
from a really famous restaurant.

1357
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,950
Oh, my. It's good.

1358
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,450
It really is tasty.

1359
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,820
(The more plates are stacked,
the older they get.)

1360
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,030
My,
the cold sashimi soup is refreshing.

1361
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,860
- The monkfish bulgogi is amazing.
- It's so fresh.

1362
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,230
The japchae is good.

1363
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,330
(Many plates are gone now.)

1364
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,370
Excuse me. Hey, mister!

1365
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,370
Tidy up the table, please.

1366
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,440
I want to keep the table clean
while eating.

1367
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,410
Don't you think you ate too much?

1368
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,640
(A large pile of plates)

1369
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,110
I don't care. We should eat a lot...

1370
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,480
so that we'll never have to play
a game like this.

1371
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,650
The staff will say, "Gosh,
they ate as much as they wanted."

1372
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,550
- We should show them we don't care.
- Exactly.

1373
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,550
- We don't care. This one is bigger.
- Gosh. Hey.

1374
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,850
Se Yoon!

1375
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,350
You're getting so much older.

1376
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,490
I don't care, Jong Min.

1377
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,020
I'll just eat until I'm full.

1378
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,190
I'll eat until I'm full.

1379
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,730
Se Yoon is over 100 years old now.

1380
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,300
Drinking sophora root tea makes you
feel relieved.

1381
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,530
No. I won't drink it.

1382
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,000
Hold on. You can't eat fried chicken
without Coke.

1383
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,300
Hold on. Fried chicken goes
perfectly with Coke.

1384
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,740
Exactly.

1385
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,940
(Getting 10 years older is
not a problem to him now.)

1386
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,440
Also, think about it.

1387
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,080
Our ages are...

1388
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,840
increasing so quickly.

1389
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,110
That means getting this much older
isn't a big deal.

1390
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,510
We can enjoy the food
without worrying.

1391
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,620
(He has a point.)

1392
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,450
I'm not worried
about anything else...

1393
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,850
but the penalty I might get...

1394
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,090
since he said it'd be dreadful.

1395
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,190
(They forgot about the penalty
while enjoying the feast.)

1396
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,260
- It's good.
- I'll just enjoy the food.

1397
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,530
(31 years were added to his age.
He'll reduce his age now.)

1398
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,870
If I drink sophora root tea,

1399
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:26,440
my age will go down from 110 to 100.
I'll still be 100 years old.

1400
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,900
(Even if he drinks sophora root tea,
he'll be 100 years old.)

1401
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:29,810
Joon, you can have delicious food.

1402
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,140
Joon, have some tasty food.

1403
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,540
I'm as old as a turtle right now.

1404
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,810
- But the others are old as well.
- That's not...

1405
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:36,980
No, that doesn't matter.

1406
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,680
- Joon.
- Yes?

1407
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,350
While enjoying the food,
I suddenly realized...

1408
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,580
that I was so old.

1409
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,050
- Yes. You can get used to this tea.
- I'm...

1410
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,260
I'm as old as a turtle now.

1411
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,690
Joon, look at DinDin.

1412
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,260
- Come on, Joon.
- But he's young.

1413
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,030
- I'm about 120 years old.
- Aren't you in your 20s now?

1414
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,730
- I'm 120 years old.
- How old are you? You're 30...

1415
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,300
Come on. You're young.

1416
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,070
(I'm relaxed since I'm young.)

1417
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,470
Joon, you can enjoy more food.

1418
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,940
I've enjoyed enough food.

1419
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,370
(Refusing)

1420
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,340
- Director, I...
- It's too spicy.

1421
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,440
I am here to win.

1422
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,010
(Kim Poison's goal is to win.)

1423
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,480
- Would you lose if you ate a lot?
- This is not a contest.

1424
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,110
- What are you talking about?
- Seriously, after sleeping indoors,

1425
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,250
I realized
how sweet the victory was.

1426
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,150
So I decided to try my best to win
when I'm on the show.

1427
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,650
I came here with that mindset.

1428
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,690
Joon thinks of this as a sport.

1429
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,560
(Joon drinks sophora root tea
for the first time in his life.)

1430
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,930
(Drinking up)

1431
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,260
My, this is nice.

1432
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,360
Gosh, I'm full.

1433
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,360
Oh, this isn't bad.
It's not bad at all.

1434
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,970
This isn't bad.

1435
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,400
I think I can reduce my age
to 90 years.

1436
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,200
(He rushes to the food table
as the tea doesn't taste so bad.)

1437
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,370
Joon, I drank two cups of it.

1438
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:36,510
My stomach hurts now.

1439
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:37,870
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1440
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,540
I'm not like them.

1441
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,980
(He'll drink another cup
of sophora root tea!)

1442
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,380
(Intense tenacity toward a victory)

1443
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,650
How about we do this?

1444
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,720
How about each of us gives 1 person
a 10-year plate?

1445
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,260
- Rock-paper-scissors? Okay.
- Yes.

1446
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,990
- That's the worst.
- I'll go get more plates by myself.

1447
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,630
- Se Yoon, you're eating too much...
- My gosh. Look at him.

1448
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,600
He has no boundaries.

1449
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,670
(He got 20 years older.)

1450
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:06,870
Se Yoon, are you all right?

1451
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,670
I brought some food for my son,
who's coming late.

1452
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,440
Hey,
will you have another bowl of rice?

1453
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,080
What do you want to eat?

1454
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,710
- Here you go.
- Oh, fried chicken?

1455
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,450
- He's going overboard.
- Fried chicken? Okay.

1456
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,350
- Okay. Hurry up.
- Dad, I want some root vegetables.

1457
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,750
What? You don't eat vegetables
at a buffet.

1458
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,820
Okay. Bye.

1459
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,420
(Laughing)

1460
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,820
Se Yoon,
I think you're going overboard.

1461
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,020
We get to eat a lot for lunch
thanks to this game.

1462
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,090
(Bye)

1463
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:31,360
Good. I feel relaxed
now that I can't see it.

1464
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,100
It's supposed to be out of my sight.

1465
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,400
- Se Yoon.
- Yes?

1466
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,500
Can I try a piece of LA galbi?

1467
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,770
Joon, let's...

1468
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,800
try our best not to get much older,
just in case.

1469
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,370
Absolutely. Let's do that.

1470
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,570
- I don't know. Gosh.
- Sae Ho, think again carefully.

1471
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,910
You got 50 years older
after the 1st game.

1472
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:49,140
- You could get 500 years older.
- Really?

1473
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,050
I can see what's going on
in Director Joo's mind, right?

1474
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,750
Let's say we try
not to get much older in this game.

1475
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,620
And in the next game,
the loser gets 200 years older.

1476
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,220
- Then this would be pointless.
- You'd regret not eating much.

1477
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,220
Then he would laugh like this.

1478
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,450
(Director Joo laughs.)

1479
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,720
- I'm 100 percent sure.
- You're right.

1480
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,760
(This is the laughter
that DinDin described.)

1481
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,160
I'll eat galbi too.

1482
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,060
(All right. Let's eat.)

1483
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,260
He just gave us a signal.

1484
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,230
- Good. Eat some more.
- I'll wait for galbi.

1485
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,230
(Jong Min, Kim First Shoot, decided
to eat some more.)

1486
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,300
- Jong Hyun basically let us to eat.
- The one who ate more food.

1487
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,670
Right. He's letting us
eat as much as we want.

1488
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,940
I don't know.

1489
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,310
Wait. What's that?

1490
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:18,740
- What's that?
- What's what?

1491
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,880
- What is it?
- Dried persimmon.

1492
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,140
- Is there dried persimmon?
- That's a nice dessert.

1493
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,180
(I can't resist a dessert.)

1494
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,250
I'll have dessert.

1495
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,820
- I'll eat this one. No, this one.
- Okay.

1496
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,820
(He picks up two 5-year plates.)

1497
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,850
(He brought
all the dried persimmon rolls.)

1498
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,060
He's just unbelievable.

1499
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:37,930
He's a real man.

1500
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,130
(The table is filled with plates.)

1501
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,230
You're incredible.

1502
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,460
- How old are you, you brat?
- Pardon me?

1503
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,500
How rude.

1504
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,630
I'm sorry, sir.

1505
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,270
He must be almost 200 years old.

1506
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,100
Joon, would you like to try
a dried persimmon roll?

1507
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,040
No, I'm good.
I'll buy one when I go home.

1508
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,740
- Really?
- Me too.

1509
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,680
He said he was here to win.
Leave him alone.

1510
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,350
What?

1511
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,080
- Gosh, I'm full.
- I'm so full.

1512
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,220
How was the meal?
You guys ate plenty, right?

1513
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:03,990
- Yes.
- I want to eat one more plate.

1514
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,920
I'm too full to eat any more food.

1515
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,190
(Everyone is full, except for Joon.)

1516
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,460
(I really enjoyed the food.)

1517
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,660
I see that you had enough food.

1518
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,830
- Yes. I ate just enough.
- You didn't eat too much.

1519
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,430
- You had a cup of sophora root tea.
- Yes.

1520
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:22,540
(Kim Public Service Worker
properly enjoyed the feast.)

1521
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,970
Now, I'm going to announce
the additional ages you gained.

1522
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,010
Joon gained 11 years.

1523
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:31,380
(Joon, Kim Poison, gained 11 years.)

1524
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,780
- He's so determined.
- He's amazing.

1525
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,320
I won't live as he does.

1526
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,390
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

1527
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,960
Next, Sae Ho gained 21 years.

1528
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,060
Okay.

1529
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,590
Jong Min...

1530
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,160
- gained 61 years.
- Okay.

1531
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,400
(Jong Min, Kim First Shoot,
gained 61 years.)

1532
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,360
Seon Ho gained 82 years.

1533
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,370
(Seon Ho, Kim Possible,
gained 82 years.)

1534
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,340
DinDin gained 111 years.

1535
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,470
Okay.

1536
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:55,970
- Next...
- That's a stylish number.

1537
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,570
- The number 111.
- Se Yoon gained 226 years.

1538
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,540
- That's all.
- Hey, you're amazing.

1539
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,110
There's no difference
between 250 and 300 years.

1540
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,450
They're just the same.
It won't change your life.

1541
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:06,580
Listen up.

1542
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,420
- It's not over yet.
- Is there something else?

1543
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,390
Before I announce your final ages,

1544
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,560
I have an important announcement
to make.

1545
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,590
This is it. I knew it.

1546
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,790
Please check
the bottom of each plate...

1547
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:19,830
that you have.

1548
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,500
- What? Why?
- What's going on?

1549
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,100
What's going on? Okay!

1550
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,170
- Why?
- Okay!

1551
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,040
Check each and every plate of yours.

1552
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,170
So eating much food gives us
an advantage.

1553
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,440
I should've eaten more food!

1554
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,280
- Okay.
- What? There's nothing here.

1555
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,310
(Everyone check the bottom
of their plates with excitement.)

1556
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,810
Do any of you have an unusual plate?

1557
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,650
Please.

1558
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,250
- There's nothing here.
- I have no unusual plates.

1559
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,020
(Joon laughs joyfully.)

1560
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,220
(Joon was thoroughly checking
the few plates he had.)

1561
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,390
He has a plate
with a four-leaf clover.

1562
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,930
(He found a four-leaf clover.)

1563
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,760
- I won!
- Congratulations!

1564
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,870
(Kim Poison, the lucky guy)

1565
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,700
- Hold on.
- I won!

1566
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,570
(He had only 7 plates.)

1567
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,710
(And 3 of them had food and drink
that were hard to eat.)

1568
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,540
- I won't live as he does.
- Me neither.

1569
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,580
(He held out even when the others
made fun of him.)

1570
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,680
- Hold on.
- I won!

1571
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,820
- Congratulations!
- He's going somewhere, right?

1572
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,950
- No, Joon hit the jackpot!
- I won.

1573
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,260
- What does that mean?
- What?

1574
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,090
- Everyone, listen.
- Joon takes all our ages?

1575
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,330
Joon...

1576
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,500
got the right to hand over...

1577
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,560
all the dishes he finished
to another member.

1578
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,030
(He can hand over all his dishes
to another member.)

1579
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,170
Darn it.

1580
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,840
(There's another four-leaf clover?)

1581
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,910
What?

1582
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:42,440
(Age is only a number.)

1583
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,380
(Eating well leads to a happy life.)

1584
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:47,580
- Galbi.
- Hold on.

1585
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,420
(He enjoyed the feast
without worrying about his age.)

1586
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,190
I can't believe this.

1587
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,420
(The luck has come
to the one who eats well.)

1588
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,590
He had one too?

1589
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,990
(Don't let it be Se Yoon.)

1590
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,200
(He has dishes worth 226 years.)

1591
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,360
- I'm speechless.
- He's lucky.

1592
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,360
Never give up.

1593
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,330
Put every last bite into your mouth!

1594
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:05,870
And you will get lucky like me.

1595
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,300
That means he'll give 226 years
to another member.

1596
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,270
Which one of them looked down on me
the most?

1597
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,240
Let's start with Joon.

1598
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,010
The other members,
please close your eyes.

1599
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,710
(Getting 11 years
doesn't sound so bad.)

1600
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,350
Joon, go.

1601
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,880
(Here goes Joon.)

1602
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,090
You know...

1603
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,250
We all are as old as a turtle.

1604
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,390
(Contemplating)

1605
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:29,390
I'll think of only myself
to make my decision.

1606
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,760
Because this is competition.

1607
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,770
(He takes steps carefully.)

1608
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:41,400
(The person
whom he's going toward is...)

1609
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,910
(He's making everyone nervous.)

1610
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,610
- Hey, show no mercy.
- Okay.

1611
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,110
This is what a game is about.

1612
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,310
Don't falter.
Just give those to him and leave.

1613
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,780
(Please don't come to me.)

1614
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:00,260
(Joon chose Sae Ho.)

1615
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,690
Okay. He made his choice.
Keep your eyes closed.

1616
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,760
Se Yoon, it's your turn now.

1617
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,200
Okay.

1618
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,800
- That's practically a nuclear bomb.
- Hold on.

1619
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,070
Shouldn't Joon stand with them?

1620
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,470
- Yes, he should stand with them.
- Right.

1621
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:14,940
(Me too?)

1622
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,370
- He never lets us down.
- That's Moon Grand Award.

1623
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:18,910
- He's a great entertainer.
- Are you serious?

1624
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:21,040
- It's all good if it's not me.
- Moon Grand Award!

1625
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,110
- Eleven years were too much.
- It's all good if it's not me.

1626
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,850
- It didn't cross my mind.
- Eleven years were too much.

1627
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,950
- Eleven years were too much!
- That was out of line.

1628
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,720
- He said he was here to win.
- Close your eyes.

1629
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:31,390
- Se Yoon, go now.
- What did he...

1630
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,790
- He thinks this is a sports game.
- My point, exactly.

1631
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:35,320
Sae Ho keeps looking
through half-closed eyes.

1632
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,130
No. It's because of the wind.
I didn't open my eyes.

1633
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,790
Close your eyes tightly.
Frown your eyes.

1634
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:40,530
Frown your eyes and make sure
there are eight frown lines.

1635
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,270
Do you want me to divide the dishes
or give them all to one person?

1636
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:45,630
- Give them all to one person!
- He...

1637
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,140
- He should receive those.
- There's only one person...

1638
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,570
who wants this dish.

1639
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,940
- You're the only one.
- No.

1640
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,770
- It's okay. No.
- You're the only one who answered.

1641
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,510
- Everyone.
- Yes.

1642
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:58,880
I'll put these down in five seconds
as I walk past.

1643
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,420
You should scream for five seconds.

1644
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,880
So that you don't know
where I put these down.

1645
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,320
I might put these down in front
of those who scream quietly.

1646
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,990
DinDin, I don't see wrinkles
around your eyes.

1647
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:10,160
Scream for five seconds!

1648
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,260
Scream!

1649
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,230
(Where are the heavy dishes headed?)

1650
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,200
I hope you make a good decision.

1651
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,870
I trust your choice.

1652
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:22,840
We now have an elderly man here.

1653
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,170
Open your eyes.

1654
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:26,310
Open your eyes.

1655
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,840
- Sir!
- The oldest!

1656
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,380
- Sir.
- Sir.

1657
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,510
(His nuclear bomb came to me.)

1658
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,950
- He got the dishes.
- No!

1659
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,220
- Sir.
- Sir.

1660
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,750
(Kim Accidentally, Sae Ho
is 237 years older.)

1661
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,520
I don't know. For Joon and me...

1662
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,090
(Sae Ho was scared
that he was getting older.)

1663
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,730
Sophora root tea.

1664
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:49,900
(He finished two glasses
of sophora root tea in a row.)

1665
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,670
(He even had fermented skate too.)

1666
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,810
- Is this for real?
- Yes.

1667
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:01,180
(Why did this happen to me?)

1668
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:04,480
We'll sum it all up
and tell you the result in the van.

1669
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,750
(The final result
will be shown shortly.)

1670
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,050
- All right.
- That's your call.

1671
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,720
And today...

1672
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,420
we will head to the base camp early.

1673
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,650
- Already?
- All right.

1674
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,160
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

1675
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,260
(Me?)

1676
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:19,260
(Did you call me?)

1677
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,030
Which Jong Min will hit the slate?

1678
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:22,530
Jong Min, you should do it.

1679
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,100
Jong Min.

1680
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,200
I don't feel...

1681
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,070
I don't feel like hitting the slate.

1682
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:29,340
Kim Accidentally will hit it.

1683
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,510
Ready?

1684
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:31,510
(Sad slate hit
by Mr. Kim Accidentally)

1685
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:32,870
One, two, three.

1686
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,040
I'm so full.

1687
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,380
You were the best, Se Yoon.

1688
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,420
- I'm so full.
- You were the best.

1689
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,520
You're full too.

1690
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:43,720
Se Yoon just had a dopamine rush.

1691
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,790
(He had a legit dopamine rush.)

1692
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:46,250
I'm about to go number two as well.

1693
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:51,090
Sae Ho, you should have just done it
like Se Yoon, like a real man.

1694
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:53,530
- You just eat, and that's it.
- I know. He was the best.

1695
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,730
- That was so cool.
- You kept trying to hold back.

1696
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:56,830
Look what happened to him.

1697
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:58,000
It became nothing
when he tried to save it so hard.

1698
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,300
What?

1699
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:02,770
- You're right.
- Yes, I'm a fool! You happy now?

1700
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:04,240
You'll be like Sae Ho
if you save it too much.

1701
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,010
(Today's lesson: You'll be like
Sae Ho if you save it too much.)

1702
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,680
- I won't save it.
- Me neither.

1703
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,250
- In case you're wondering...
- Yes?

1704
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,020
- I'll give you an interim brief.
- Okay.

1705
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,950
- Okay.
- I'm sure Se Yoon's winning.

1706
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:18,150
- Here's the order of the age.
- I got younger.

1707
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,450
Se Yoon is leading.

1708
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:20,590
- Really?
- Really?

1709
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,490
- Yes.
- He gave away all the dishes.

1710
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:23,690
- My goodness.
- Oh, my. How old is he?

1711
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:24,760
He's 73.

1712
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,430
- He didn't age.
- He's winning when he ate so much.

1713
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:29,200
- Second place is...
- It must be Joon.

1714
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,130
Joon. He's 79.

1715
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:33,170
- Joon.
- What, I'm 79?

1716
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:36,070
You slept indoors with me
last time, remember?

1717
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,340
- I know.
- The two of us.

1718
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,510
This is just like last week.

1719
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:39,770
- We're best friends.
- Everyone...

1720
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,610
Third place is Seon Ho.

1721
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:43,880
What? I'm in third place?

1722
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:45,780
He's 122.

1723
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,920
(Seon Ho is 122 years old.)

1724
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,250
- He suddenly got much older here.
- Next, it's Jong Min.

1725
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:50,920
I'm so old.

1726
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,350
- He's 139.
- You're safe.

1727
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,560
Next, it's DinDin.

1728
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,160
He's 149.

1729
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,790
This is just a 20-year difference.

1730
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,130
- We can turn the tables.
- Right, we can easily do that.

1731
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,530
- If we just lift a finger.
- Next, it's Sae Ho.

1732
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,170
- Can you guess your age?
- I should be about 303.

1733
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,840
You're 321.

1734
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,270
(Sae Ho is 321 years old.)

1735
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:09,840
- What?
- You lived three centuries.

1736
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,940
So what?

1737
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:12,070
(Sensitive)

1738
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,370
(The order of age)

1739
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,680
You must be one of the oldest
living creatures.

1740
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,910
(1st Se Yoon, 2nd Joon, 3rd Seon Ho)

1741
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:17,150
(4th Jong Min, 5th DinDin,
6th Sae Ho)

1742
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:20,180
I know I'm much older than you all.

1743
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,420
You think I can turn the tables?

1744
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,620
Don't answer him.

1745
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,820
That sounds hard.

1746
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,420
We'll cheat for sure
if we can turn the tables.

1747
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,520
I think you can turn the tables
as long as you don't give up.

1748
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,990
- Okay.
- You'll feel better if you give up.

1749
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,330
You'll feel better if you give up.

1750
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:34,430
(That's true.)

1751
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,430
(He can't believe it.)

1752
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,870
Guys, don't give up.

1753
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:42,100
(Don't give up. You never know
when your luck would come.)

1754
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,740
(Just like me)

1755
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,040
I've been to Oedo Island
on that ferry before.

1756
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,410
What's Noedo?

1757
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,950
- There's Oedo and Noedo?
- I'm coming as well.

1758
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,250
I'm 300 years old too.

1759
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,380
You can get to Noedo from there
and Oedo from here.

1760
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,790
I guess we're going to Noedo Island.

1761
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:59,590
- Where is that?
- What is Noedo?

1762
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:00,790
(Where is today's base camp?)

1763
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,260
(Noedo Island Ferry Dock)

1764
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,690
You can get on the ferry now.

1765
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,690
- Get on the ferry?
- Are we headed to an island?

1766
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,360
From here onward,

1767
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,460
your managers won't be joining.

1768
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,130
So bring your own luggage.

1769
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,430
- It's party time for the managers.
- Right.

1770
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,600
(What is this unsettling flow?)

1771
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:14,970
Get your luggage
and get on the ferry.

1772
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,270
Oh, my gosh.

1773
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,670
All right. Thank you.

1774
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,740
(Working in perfect order)

1775
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,310
- Thank you.
- You can relax now.

1776
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,980
I guess we won't be seeing
each other tonight.

1777
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:25,580
- You can't.
- Right.

1778
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,680
- Get on the ferry now.
- Let's go.

1779
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,220
- Okay.
- Use Jong Min's card to party.

1780
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:31,920
I'll go now.

1781
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,320
Use my credit card to eat.

1782
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,260
- Eat jjajangmyeon.
- Monkfish soup is delicious here.

1783
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,460
Stir-fried monkfish is good too.

1784
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,860
Treat yourself to a decent meal.

1785
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,990
- Bye.
- See you.

1786
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,000
(Looking sad)

1787
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,000
(The ferry
with 6 Jong Mins departing)

1788
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,230
They're saying goodbye.

1789
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,600
(It's free time.)

1790
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,800
We're headed...

1791
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,470
to a nice place for Jong Min
who likes islands.

1792
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,610
We're headed to an island.

1793
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,680
He loves islands.

1794
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,780
We're headed to Noedo Island,

1795
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:01,450
a hidden treasure of Geoje
filled with love and romance.

1796
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:04,590
- It's Noedo Island.
- I can be romantic too.

1797
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,090
Has Jong Min ever been
to Noedo Island?

1798
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,820
- I've never been there.
- How about Oedo Island?

1799
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:10,830
Oedo...

1800
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,990
(That's impossible
for the groom-to-be.)

1801
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,560
(Falsely accused)

1802
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,800
- Oedo Island is right next to it.
- It's Oedo over there.

1803
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,870
- Oedo is next to Noedo?
- Right.

1804
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,470
- I see.
- Don't go near Oedo Island.

1805
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,170
- Right.
- I won't be going to Oedo Island.

1806
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,170
(Groom-to-be won't be stepping
his foot on Oedo Island.)

1807
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,940
For your reference, Noedo Island...

1808
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,180
has no convenience stores
nor restaurants.

1809
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,280
- Then what do we do?
- What do we do?

1810
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,080
It's just a small island.

1811
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,150
What do we do then?
Shouldn't we buy something now?

1812
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,250
- What did you say?
- Shouldn't we buy stuff in advance?

1813
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,620
Your necessities are there.

1814
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,050
How about our dinner?

1815
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:41,090
We'll get it sorted it out for you.

1816
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:43,060
What's the population there?

1817
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,630
- There are about 30 people.
- Really?

1818
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:45,830
It's a small island.

1819
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,200
(Noedo Island)

1820
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,800
All the houses are painted yellow.

1821
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,900
The yellow color is pretty.

1822
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,300
The yellow roof must be
the key attraction.

1823
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,670
Camelia flowers are in season
on Noedo Island.

1824
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:58,770
Camelia flowers.

1825
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:00,740
Gosh, it's pretty.

1826
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,480
(Filled with love and romance)

1827
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,710
It's so pretty here.

1828
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,150
I can see that not so many people
live here on this island.

1829
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,420
- It's so small and cute.
- Right.

1830
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:11,020
We're here. It didn't take us long.

1831
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,690
It's so small.

1832
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,090
- I know.
- Get down.

1833
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,420
Let's go.

1834
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,660
- Jong Min.
- Okay.

1835
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,430
- Next Jong Min.
- Yes.

1836
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,430
Yes.

1837
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,160
- Jong Min.
- Yes.

1838
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,870
- Me?
- Isn't this yours?

1839
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,470
- Gosh, it's so heavy.
- Guys, we are here.

1840
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:27,570
Isn't this place pretty?

1841
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:28,670
- I know.
- Noedo Island is pretty.

1842
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,670
The guest house
with the yellow roof over there.

1843
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,010
That's your base camp for the day.

1844
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:34,010
I see many guest houses
with yellow roofs.

1845
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:38,050
We'll be using one of them.

1846
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:39,150
Okay.

1847
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,450
It's right next to the sea.

1848
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:41,650
(Located in the innermost area
next to the sea)

1849
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,450
- Enjoy your trip.
- Bye.

1850
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:45,090
- Bye.
- Is Noedo Island pretty?

1851
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:46,250
- Yes.
- All right.

1852
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,890
They must be leaving
after taking a tour.

1853
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:49,090
- Bye.
- Bye.

1854
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,390
- Hello.
- I was waiting for you.

1855
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:53,260
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1856
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,100
- Bye.
- Jong Min is here.

1857
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:56,560
Jong Min.

1858
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,070
Jong Min.

1859
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,630
I heard you're getting married.

1860
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,070
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1861
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,170
Thank you.

1862
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,210
- You must be my age.
- Congratulations.

1863
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,210
All right.

1864
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,310
(Laughing)

1865
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,640
- Jong Min's very good-looking.
- We're shooting our show.

1866
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,510
Everyone in Korea knows
about Jong Min's wedding.

1867
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,180
Let's get going now.

1868
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,550
- All right.
- Sure.

1869
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,050
- Whose luggage is this?
- Do you need help?

1870
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:18,220
You can put it up here.

1871
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,560
- Put your luggage here.
- You can put it there.

1872
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,560
- Who's pulling this?
- You.

1873
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,560
- Why?
- You're the youngest one here.

1874
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,960
The youngest one should be doing it.

1875
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,900
I'm 149 years old.

1876
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,900
I'm 321. Get out of my way.

1877
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,300
Gosh, 321?

1878
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,700
(Dignity of someone
who lived 3 centuries)

1879
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:35,900
This is so small.

1880
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,510
No convenience stores
or grocery stores.

1881
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:38,710
This must be all.

1882
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:41,340
(Spotted the food truck)

1883
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,810
How did the food truck come here?

1884
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

1885
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,550
- What's the menu today?
- Spicy pork ssambap.

1886
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,380
(It sounds delicious.)

1887
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,050
You have to look at nature.

1888
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,590
- What's the other menu?
- I like it.

1889
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,990
- Enjoy nature.
- What?

1890
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,190
- You want us to see nature?
- Yes.

1891
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,230
Why?
We're looking at the food truck.

1892
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,800
They have tangsuyuk for dinner.

1893
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:02,530
Spicy pork ssambap.

1894
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:03,970
This must be the base camp.

1895
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,130
- It's pretty.
- It's very pretty.

1896
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,500
Goodness, it's beautiful.

1897
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,100
- That's all hijiki.
- Hijiki?

1898
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,340
- They're collecting hijiki.
- You're right.

1899
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,410
It's full of hijiki here.

1900
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,510
- That's all hijiki.
- Goodness.

1901
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,810
Is this all hijiki?

1902
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:20,250
It's all hijiki.

1903
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,380
You are right.

1904
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:22,720
I love hijiki.

1905
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,390
- Seasoned hijiki is delicious.
- Right, it's good.

1906
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,760
It's also good when you mix it
with rice.

1907
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,260
It's all hijiki.

1908
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,630
It's all hijiki.

1909
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:31,960
It's all hijiki over there.

1910
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,660
(Jong Min's excited to see hijiki.)

1911
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

1912
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,900
- My goodness.
- Jong Min! Hello.

1913
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,070
Hello.

1914
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,870
Ma'am. The hijiki...

1915
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,140
It's full of hijiki.

1916
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,010
Gosh, there's a lot.

1917
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,440
- There's a lot.
- It's full of hijiki.

1918
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,180
- There's a lot.
- Right.

1919
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,950
It's all natural.

1920
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,380
- Natural hijiki.
- Right.

1921
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,020
It's different from other hijiki.

1922
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:55,150
It looks more plump.

1923
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,380
- Right.
- It's chubbier.

1924
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,790
Pointed ones are farmed.

1925
01:01:58,850 --> 01:01:59,850
This is wild hijiki.

1926
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,320
That's why they're so big.

1927
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:02,720
I see.

1928
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,590
- So this one here...
- Yes?

1929
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:06,990
Does it get pushed by the waves?

1930
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,700
It sticks on these rocks.
Then we collect them.

1931
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,370
It grows again after a year.

1932
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:12,370
(The hijiki grows again
after a year.)

1933
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,340
- It grows again.
- Right.

1934
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:17,240
- It's like a treasure house here.
- That's right.

1935
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,370
Right, ma'am?

1936
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,580
It's full of seaweed and hijiki.

1937
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,140
My goodness.

1938
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,980
Do you want to try cutting it
with these scissors?

1939
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,250
Where? Which one?

1940
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,650
We can just cut it with scissors.

1941
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,620
Grab it like this and cut.

1942
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,950
(Cut it as you grab the body
without cutting the root.)

1943
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,020
- Like this?
- Yes.

1944
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,550
(Harvesting hijiki with scissors)

1945
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:36,220
- You can just cut it.
- Right, cut it.

1946
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,330
(Grabbing)

1947
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:38,430
(Cutting)

1948
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:39,560
Here you go, ma'am.

1949
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,300
You can cut the whole thing.

1950
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,500
You're good.

1951
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,100
It's so soft.

1952
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:46,830
(Working hard)

1953
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:49,700
- You're really quick.
- There's a lot.

1954
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:53,610
- There is a lot here.
- I'm good.

1955
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,580
(They're busy collecting hijiki.)

1956
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:56,780
- There is a lot.
- This is amazing.

1957
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:02,580
(They're into it.)

1958
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,320
We also make hijiki rice.

1959
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,250
- We make hijiki rice.
- It's tasty.

1960
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,360
There's hijiki kimchi too.

1961
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,420
(He's fallen in love
with the charms of hijiki.)

1962
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,530
This was a goat, not a puppy.

1963
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,360
- Goat.
- Se Yoon.

1964
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,900
A goat?

1965
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:18,970
Hey.

1966
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:20,540
(There's a real goat.)

1967
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:22,240
Are you a puppy?

1968
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,170
This is like a puppy. A pet goat.

1969
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:25,670
This is amazing.

1970
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,070
Hey.

1971
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,280
What is this?

1972
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,940
It's like a puppy.

1973
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,680
- I've never seen a goat like this.
- What is this?

1974
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,780
A pet goat.

1975
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,520
What's its name?

1976
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,020
DinDin.

1977
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,750
DinDin?

1978
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,190
I meant the name of the goat.

1979
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,420
The goat? It's Kkamsoon.

1980
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,460
- Kkamsoon?
- What's her name?

1981
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,590
(Kkamsoon, the mascot of Naedo)

1982
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:43,930
She's not running away.

1983
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,590
That means she's familiar
with people.

1984
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:46,890
She's not even crying.

1985
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,300
She's really gentle.

1986
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,000
This is amazing.

1987
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,930
She's so cute.

1988
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:54,470
- Goodness. Nice to meet you.
- Why is it so gentle?

1989
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,770
- It's really amazing.
- Right?

1990
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,010
- It's amazing.
- Normally, they just run away.

1991
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,640
This is amazing.

1992
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,610
- She has a talent.
- What is her talent?

1993
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,250
When you say "head-butt,"
she comes and bumps her head.

1994
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:06,150
She comes and bumps
her head when you say "head-butt."

1995
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,120
Kkamsoon.

1996
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,380
Head-butt.

1997
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:13,790
Head-butt.

1998
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:15,560
(She comes and kisses him.)

1999
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:16,760
Head-butt, Kkamsoon.

2000
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,330
- It's different when her mom goes.
- She recognizes her.

2001
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,930
- She knows.
- You have to lift your foot.

2002
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:21,860
- Here, Kkamsoon. Head-butt.
- Head-butt.

2003
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,100
There you go. Well done.

2004
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,170
(Exclaiming)

2005
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,370
Mine too.

2006
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,270
(She shows them her talent again.)

2007
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:32,610
I feel sorry...

2008
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:33,980
- raising my foot to her.
- You can raise your foot.

2009
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:35,240
(That's amazing.)

2010
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,240
Head-butt.

2011
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,180
We should tell "Animal Farm."

2012
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:39,980
(The best head-butter, Kkamsoon)

2013
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,350
- I'll hold it.
- Thank you so much.

2014
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:44,020
Let's get going too.

2015
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:45,620
That one is heavy.

2016
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,790
(Kim Public Service Worker
can easily lift two buckets.)

2017
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:48,360
You have to be careful.

2018
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,860
(This is not hijiki.)

2019
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,760
- Stop.
- Stop.

2020
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,530
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2021
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:57,700
(We thank the village people
who helped us.)

2022
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:58,900
You dry them like this.

2023
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:04,310
(6 Jong Mins' hijiki harvest
is finished.)

2024
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:07,340
(In front of the blue sea)

2025
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:10,180
(A place where magical things
will happen)

2026
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,180
(6 Jong Mins enter.)

2027
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,480
Are there more four-leaf clovers?

2028
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,220
You can sit wherever you like.

2029
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:21,390
(He's doubtful.)

2030
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:23,760
Is there something stuck below?
Let's check if there's something.

2031
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,900
(It's clean.)

2032
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,100
(There are no four-leaf clovers.)

2033
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,630
This is nice.

2034
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:33,030
- It's nice.
- It's quiet and nice.

2035
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,900
- Isn't it so nice here?
- It's really nice.

2036
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:36,640
It's nice.

2037
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,010
The concept of today's journey...

2038
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:42,080
is When Life Gives You Age
with Six Jong Mins.

2039
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,240
That's right.

2040
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,350
- Se Yoon, the youngest.
- Yes.

2041
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,010
- Seventy-three years old.
- Goodness.

2042
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,180
- Elders. I'm sorry.
- Seriously. You're young.

2043
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:50,720
- Elders.
- Get on the floor.

2044
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,720
I'm sorry. I'm serving
as a public service officer.

2045
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,820
(The men with an average age
of 147 still live in the old era.)

2046
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,920
Joon, 79 years old.

2047
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,190
- Thank you.
- Brother.

2048
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,930
- Seon Ho, 122 years old.
- Okay.

2049
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:02,900
- Jong Min, 139 years old.
- All right.

2050
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,130
DinDin, 149 years old.

2051
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,370
- Should we sit according to age?
- Sae Ho, 321 years old.

2052
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:09,600
Everyone, get on the floor.

2053
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,770
Everyone, get on the floor.

2054
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,880
It's 321, Sae Ho. It's 321.

2055
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,610
- You're 321 years old.
- Let's do this.

2056
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:19,410
What's wrong with your clothes?

2057
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,850
Hey, be quiet.

2058
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,880
- You're cute.
- Yes.

2059
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,620
How cute.

2060
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:27,190
Hey, he's an elder.

2061
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:30,930
(I can't stand this.)

2062
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:33,930
- What are you doing to an elder?
- You look like a naughty child.

2063
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:35,260
- Even until the end.
- Let go of me.

2064
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,600
That's how I wish it would be.

2065
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,030
(This was all
in Se Yoon's imagination.)

2066
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:42,770
The oldest person
among the six Jong Mins,

2067
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,170
(Turning)

2068
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,710
- Sae Ho.
- Yes.

2069
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:49,740
It's too early to be disappointed.

2070
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,180
- Really?
- Yes. Don't give up yet.

2071
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,720
(There's something more.)

2072
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:58,390
(Is this a place
where they can get younger?)

2073
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,050
You have one last chance.

2074
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,190
- Yes!
- A last chance?

2075
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:02,890
They're torturing Sae Ho with hope.

2076
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:04,130
This mission...

2077
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,660
is Guess Who with Sharp Eyes.

2078
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:07,860
(The last age mission:
Guess Who with Sharp Eyes)

2079
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,770
You will look at a picture
of three faces combined together...

2080
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,770
- and guess whose faces they are.
- I'm really bad at this.

2081
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:15,940
(The person who guesses
all three faces wins.)

2082
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,840
(Answer:
KARINA, Kim Sook, Park Bo Young)

2083
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,810
For every correct answer,

2084
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,310
- thirty years will be deducted.
- Goodness.

2085
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,410
Then how many times
do I need to get it right?

2086
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:28,980
You still have a chance.
You could answer them all.

2087
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,120
Thirty years each?

2088
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,990
- You'd catch up really quickly.
- You'd catch up really quickly.

2089
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:34,520
It's not easy.

2090
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,660
(The order of the ages
could change.)

2091
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,930
They just need to avoid
being the oldest.

2092
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:41,760
- Then, after this,
- Yes.

2093
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,130
there will be something
for the two oldest people.

2094
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:45,770
- Right.
- There will be something.

2095
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:48,070
What did you say earlier?
Did you say it is horrible?

2096
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:50,240
- It's horrible. It's a huge one.
- Was...

2097
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,540
Did he say we will be tortured?

2098
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,110
- A torture.
- It will be as bad as torture.

2099
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,210
(Candidates for the penalty)

2100
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,880
(Will it be something like this?)

2101
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,250
(We must avoid getting the penalty.)

2102
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,020
It would be better to die.

2103
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:02,980
This isn't easy.

2104
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,350
How many do I need to answer?

2105
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:05,920
We'll start!

2106
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:08,120
- Please keep a straight face.
- Okay.

2107
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,460
Don't tell us the answer
with your face.

2108
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,620
Go, me!

2109
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:12,460
Go, me!

2110
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,960
(It's a self-centered cheer.)

2111
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,560
- That's unique.
- It's unique.

2112
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,800
- I came to win today.
- Yes.

2113
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:17,870
"Go, me."

2114
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:19,470
- The first question.
- Okay.

2115
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:20,670
This isn't a practice question.

2116
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,170
- Yes.
- Go, me!

2117
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,970
- Me too!
- Go, me!

2118
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:25,940
Ready,

2119
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,180
go!

2120
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:32,710
(Who are the three people
blended in this picture?)

2121
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,880
I have no idea.

2122
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,450
- This is really hard.
- I don't know.

2123
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:37,450
Ji Won.

2124
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:38,690
I've seen that face before.

2125
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:40,250
It's difficult.

2126
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,220
- Kim First Shoot.
- Yes.

2127
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,260
- Eun Ji Won.
- Yes.

2128
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:46,760
DinDin.

2129
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:48,330
- What?
- Cha Eun Woo.

2130
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:50,300
Wrong!

2131
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,830
Everyone.
He got two of them correct.

2132
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:54,570
It's Eun Ji Won and Cha Eun Woo.

2133
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:55,800
(He got two among them correct.)

2134
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:00,540
(Is it a blend
of Eun Ji Won and Cha Eun Woo?)

2135
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,780
- Kim First Shoot!
- Kim Possible.

2136
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:02,940
- Kim Accidentally.
- Kim Possible.

2137
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,250
- Kim Possible.
- Yes.

2138
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,250
(Seon Ho gets a chance.)

2139
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:07,850
Cha Eun Woo, Eun Ji Won,

2140
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:08,950
and Sung Han Bin.

2141
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,620
It's wrong?

2142
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,450
- Kim First Shoot!
- Who is it?

2143
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:14,190
- He got one person correct.
- Kim Public Service Worker.

2144
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,690
- What?
- He got one person correct.

2145
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:17,990
Then it's Eun Ji Won, DinDin,
and someone else.

2146
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,460
I don't see DinDin's face.

2147
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:24,060
(Then...)

2148
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,200
- Kim Poison.
- He got one person correct.

2149
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,330
- Kim Poison.
- Kim Poison.

2150
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:28,270
Eun Ji Won, DinDin,
and Kang Dong Won.

2151
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:29,570
(Eun Ji Won, DinDin,
and Kang Dong Won)

2152
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,540
(Is Kang Dong Won....)

2153
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,270
(in the picture?)

2154
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,410
Thank you.

2155
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:37,610
- Really?
- Really?

2156
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,050
- Correct.
- What?

2157
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:42,050
You're young.
Why are you getting younger?

2158
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,050
Kang Dong Won?

2159
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:44,690
Kim Poison gets 30 years deducted.

2160
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:46,020
(Lee Joon gets it correct.)

2161
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,250
Kang Dong Won?

2162
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,320
I can't see Kang Dong Won at all.

2163
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,390
It's here.

2164
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,160
- This is amazing.
- They all look handsome.

2165
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,460
Come on.

2166
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,170
(Eun Ji Won)

2167
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:00,100
(DinDin)

2168
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,670
(Kang Dong Won)

2169
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,170
(Answer: Eun Ji Won,
DinDin, Kang Dong Won)

2170
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:06,670
The person in the middle...

2171
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,180
- looks really naughty.
- I mean...

2172
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:09,540
- It's obvious.
- The one in the middle...

2173
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:10,740
- is as handsome as the rest.
- We...

2174
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,350
They put DinDin in the middle.

2175
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:14,420
- But he blends in.
- That's right.

2176
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,650
- I have Kang Dong Won's face.
- No.

2177
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,690
It's just there.

2178
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,920
- It's just there.
- He really came to win.

2179
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:22,990
I came to win.
- He's amazing.
- Kang Dong Won.

2180
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:25,130
Go, me!

2181
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:27,130
"Go, me."

2182
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:28,630
- It's not practice question!
- No!

2183
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:30,260
Kim Poison gets 30 years deducted.

2184
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,770
Thank you.

2185
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,100
- Just answer them all.
- Okay.

2186
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,440
- The next question.
- That's better.

2187
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,270
- We shouldn't give Sae Ho a chance.
- Okay.

2188
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:40,210
(What are you doing?)

2189
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:41,240
Okay.

2190
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,850
- Okay.
- It's a 5-on-1 fight.

2191
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:47,080
Cheer up. You can do it, Sae Ho.

2192
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,680
- Okay.
- Let's begin.

2193
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:50,250
Ready,

2194
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,520
Go!

2195
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,790
- What is that?
- I can tell one.

2196
01:10:56,820 --> 01:11:01,230
(It's clear that they don't know.)

2197
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,230
- I only know one of them.
- Kim Accidentally.

2198
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:04,260
Kim Accidentally.

2199
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:06,570
Dex, Yoo Byung Jae,

2200
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:10,570
(Dex, Yoo Byung Jae)

2201
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:12,540
- Three!
- Dex, Yoo Byung Jae, Park Bo Gum.

2202
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,740
- Kim Tteutto.
- Dex, Yoo Byung Jae, Park Bo Gum.

2203
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:19,610
(Dex, Yoo Byung Jae,
and Park Bo Gum?)

2204
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:21,050
- Kim Tteutto.
- Correct.

2205
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:22,820
- What?
- Who?

2206
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,590
Dex, Yoo Byung Jae, and Park Bo Gum!

2207
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:28,090
(He got it correct
in the first attempt!)

2208
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,160
- How did you get that correct?
- Goodness.

2209
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:32,430
(Yoo Byung Jae)

2210
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:33,660
(Park Bo Gum)

2211
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:36,000
- Goodness.
- Right. They're Park Bo Gum's eyes.

2212
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,330
(Answer: Yoo Byung Jae,
Park Bo Gum, Dex)

2213
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:39,370
The eyes. They're Gwan Sik's eyes.

2214
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:41,100
- I thought it was Hulk Hogan.
- Gosh.

2215
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,900
Dex, Yoo Byung Jae, Park Bo Gum!

2216
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,200
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2217
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,240
- You have a chance.
- That's 30 years.

2218
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,410
You can tell who they are?

2219
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:49,140
- I can't tell at all.
- I could tell.

2220
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,910
What are you doing, Joon?
You have to get it all right.

2221
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:52,150
Right.

2222
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:54,750
- Here it comes.
- You need magic eyes for this.

2223
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:55,980
- All right.
- It's so hard.

2224
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,220
- It's a miracle to get it right.
- Get ready.

2225
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,390
(Getting his magic eyes ready)

2226
01:11:58,850 --> 01:11:59,920
Start!

2227
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,560
- That's...
- Gosh.

2228
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:05,130
(A familiar face!)

2229
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:07,900
That's HANHAE.

2230
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,800
- That's HANHAE.
- Kim Tteutto!

2231
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,900
Kim Tteutto!

2232
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,070
Doh Kyung Soo,

2233
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:14,000
HANHAE,

2234
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,440
- Three...
- Lee Je Hoon.

2235
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:20,970
Wrong! You got two people right.

2236
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:22,310
(He got two people right
out of these people.)

2237
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,180
- You got two people right.
- Kim Accidentally!

2238
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,210
Kim Accidentally.

2239
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:27,310
Do Kyung Soo, HANHAE, Lee Dong Wook.

2240
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:28,780
(Do Kyung Soo, HANHAE,
Lee Dong Wook)

2241
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,280
- Gosh, I think he's right.
- I think he's right.

2242
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,520
- I can see Lee Dong Wook.
- Gosh!

2243
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,090
- I can see him.
- He's there.

2244
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:34,390
- Where?
- Correct.

2245
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:35,990
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2246
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:37,520
(Sae Ho gets it right again!)

2247
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,830
I can't believe he got that.

2248
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,690
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2249
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,100
- It was Lee Dong Wook.
- You're going to take the lead.

2250
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,330
He deserves credit for that.

2251
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:44,500
Lee Dong Wook!

2252
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:46,430
That was amazing.

2253
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:47,600
(The face of his close friend
couldn't be missed.)

2254
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,500
Where is Dong Wook in that photo?

2255
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,700
- I can't see him at all.
- He's nowhere to be seen.

2256
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,510
- He's there.
- The eyes look sad.

2257
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:53,640
- It's because he's close to him.
- I can see his lips too.

2258
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,780
I'm close to him.

2259
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,540
I noticed his face
as I'm close to him.

2260
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,210
- That's amazing.
- I noticed his face.

2261
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:00,180
You helped me though.
I didn't know that was Kyung Soo.

2262
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,350
- I couldn't tell.
- Gosh.

2263
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,320
Hey, stop giving out names!

2264
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:06,490
- Wait until you know all three.
- I shouldn't give out names.

2265
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:07,890
Don't say anything
until you know all three of them.

2266
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:10,420
Right. We have to win this.

2267
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:13,060
- You and I have to get it right.
- Right.

2268
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,090
- All right.
- We have to get it right.

2269
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,530
- I can't tell at all.
- Here's the next one.

2270
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,770
- I can't tell any of them.
- Get ready.

2271
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:18,770
(Determined)

2272
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:20,870
Start!

2273
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,440
What? Who are they?

2274
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,640
- Who are they?
- The hair...

2275
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,670
- Who are they?
- Call out the answer confidently.

2276
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:28,310
I can't remember his name.

2277
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,980
Who is that person in front?

2278
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,350
Who is that handsome guy?

2279
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:32,880
I figured out one person.

2280
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,050
I figured out one person too.

2281
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:36,120
- I figured out one of them.
- Right.

2282
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,350
Tell me the names.
I can't tell who the rest are.

2283
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,590
Giving out names might be a mistake.

2284
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,490
Why can't I remember the name
of the guy with long hair?

2285
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:45,390
Who? I'll give you a hint, buddy.

2286
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:46,730
Kim Ji...

2287
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:48,200
Please say the answer.

2288
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,730
- Kim Public Service Worker!
- Kim Public Service Worker.

2289
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:52,670
Kim Ji Hoon, the actor.

2290
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,130
Im Woo Il!

2291
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,100
It looks like Woo Il's hair.

2292
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,340
- Woo Il has longer hair.
- Three...

2293
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,940
- The last person is...
- Two...

2294
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,170
Lee Joon. I don't even know.

2295
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:02,710
Wrong! You got one person right.

2296
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:03,940
- Kim Accidentally!
- Kim Accidentally.

2297
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,750
Kim Ji Hoon, Go Soo,

2298
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,850
and Song Seung Heon.

2299
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:10,950
- Wrong! You got one person right.
- Really?

2300
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:12,820
Then it must be Kim Ji Hoon.

2301
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,990
It's Kim Ji Hoon.

2302
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,790
It's Kim Ji Hoon.

2303
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,790
Can I see it from closer?

2304
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:20,930
- I can't see it!
- You can't do that!

2305
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:23,000
- I have no idea at all.
- I figured out two people.

2306
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,100
- I've never seen them.
- The answers must be stolen.

2307
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:26,870
- I think I know two of them.
- The names should be called out.

2308
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:31,740
(The faces do feel familiar.)

2309
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,240
All right, everyone.

2310
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,640
- Would you like a hint?
- Yes.

2311
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,080
One person's last name is Choi.

2312
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,110
- That's a hard one.
- The other person's last name...

2313
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:41,320
- is Cha.
- Cha. Gosh!

2314
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,880
- Kim Poison!
- Kim First Shoot!

2315
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,880
- Kim Poison.
- Kim First Shoot!

2316
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:44,950
Kim Poison.

2317
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:47,150
Kim Ji Hoon, Cha Tae Hyun,

2318
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,590
Choi Soo Jong.

2319
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,220
- Kim Public Service Worker!
- Wrong!

2320
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,330
Cha Tae Hyun, Choi Soo Jong.

2321
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:53,630
(It's Cha Tae Hyun!)

2322
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:54,830
- Kim First Shoot!
- Kim Public Service Worker!

2323
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,000
- Wrong!
- Kim Public Service Worker!

2324
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,470
- Kim First Shoot!
- Kim Public Service Worker!

2325
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:59,700
(Kim Ji Hoon, Cha Tae Hyun)

2326
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:00,870
Who was faster?

2327
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:02,070
I was faster.

2328
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:03,970
- Let's go with rock-paper-scissors.
- No. It was Kim First Shoot.

2329
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:05,140
Let's go with rock-paper-scissors.

2330
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:06,170
(They end up deciding it
with rock-paper-scissors.)

2331
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:07,170
(Joining in)

2332
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,110
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Why are you joining in?

2333
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:10,280
- Why can't I?
- What are you doing?

2334
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,780
- Why can't I join in?
- It'll be just us four then.

2335
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,080
(Let me in.)

2336
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,080
It'll be just us four.

2337
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,620
- Ready or not... Hurry.
- All right.

2338
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,190
- Come on!
- What are you doing?

2339
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:19,420
- You just went.
- What's going on?

2340
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,790
All right.
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

2341
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,590
Rock-paper-scissors!

2342
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:26,990
(Scissors, rock)

2343
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:28,160
Okay!

2344
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,760
- Please.
- Give me the chance.

2345
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,070
Hold on.

2346
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:33,200
Rock-paper-scissors!

2347
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,200
Okay!

2348
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:36,540
I don't know
the other person though.

2349
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,240
- Kim Ji Hoon,
- Right.

2350
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:41,210
Cha Tae Hyun,

2351
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,540
and Choi...

2352
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,950
(Kim Joon Hoon, Cha Tae Hyun)

2353
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:46,980
Choi...

2354
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:51,950
(If Sae Ho gets it right again,
he reduces 90 years!)

2355
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:53,550
Choi Kang Chang Min.

2356
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,160
- Kim Tteutto!
- Wrong!

2357
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,220
- Kim Public Service Worker!
- Kim Tteutto!

2358
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,220
- I was faster!
- No way!

2359
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,730
- Kim Tteutto!
- Kim Public Service Worker!

2360
01:15:58,730 --> 01:15:59,890
- I was faster!
- No way!

2361
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:01,360
- I was faster!
- Kim Public Service Worker!

2362
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,030
- I was faster after the reset!
- Kim Public Service Worker!

2363
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:04,260
- It was me!
- No!

2364
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,930
- All right.
- I was faster after the reset!

2365
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:08,100
- Just play rock-paper-scissors.
- No.

2366
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:09,700
- That makes no sense!
- Come on!

2367
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,110
He called out his name
before the result was announced!

2368
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:14,270
He called out his name
before the result was announced.

2369
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:15,840
- Play again.
- It's me!

2370
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,140
It's me!

2371
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,410
- Gosh!
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

2372
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:20,310
- It's me!
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

2373
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,480
(Even a magician appears.)

2374
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:22,580
Where's my hat?

2375
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,220
(The Jong Mins' actions
are unpredictable.)

2376
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:27,890
- Keep a distance, everyone.
- It's me!

2377
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:29,590
It's me. It's definitely me.

2378
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:31,490
- No. I'm going to get it right.
- Kim Tteutto should answer it.

2379
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:34,090
- I'll get it right. It's over.
- Call out the answer.

2380
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:35,560
Kim Ji Hoon,

2381
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:38,230
Cha Tae Hyun, Choi Si Won.

2382
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:39,430
Gosh, I was going to say that.

2383
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:40,530
- Si Won is there?
- I was going to say that?

2384
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:42,640
That's Si Won's chin!

2385
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:44,500
- Right.
- You can tell it's him.

2386
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,340
- I was going to say that.
- Correct!

2387
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,480
That's Si Won's chin.

2388
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,340
That's Si Won's chin.

2389
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,510
- And...
- Right. That's Si Won's chin.

2390
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:53,210
Why is he laughing like me?

2391
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:57,080
(Choi Si Won)

2392
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,650
(Kim Ji Hoon)

2393
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:00,220
(Cha Tae Hyun)

2394
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:04,690
(Answer: Choi Si Won, Kim Ji Hoon,
Cha Tae Hyun)

2395
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:08,400
- That was nice.
- You can survive then.

2396
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,030
No. I have to get
another question right.

2397
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,070
You beat Jong Min anyway.

2398
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:13,430
(DinDin survived
from the penalty zone.)

2399
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:15,970
You're right.
I should still get another one.

2400
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:17,270
But I will get it right.

2401
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:18,270
(The next round suddenly makes
everyone feel desperate.)

2402
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:20,640
- Let's move on!
- This is exciting!

2403
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,940
(This is exciting!)

2404
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,580
(Meanwhile, 261-year-old Sae Ho
has a lot of work to do.)

2405
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:25,780
Let's go with another topic.

2406
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:27,210
- We should go for 50 years.
- For 50 years.

2407
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,780
Okay! That sounds great!

2408
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,320
(The other penalty candidate
agrees with it.)

2409
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,550
- The next one will be for 50 years.
- No.

2410
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,990
- No way.
- I won't let that happen.

2411
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:37,320
- That sounds great!
- No way.

2412
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,130
I won't let that happen.
Playing for 50 years is too much.

2413
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:42,500
I'm still over 200 years old
after cutting down 50 years.

2414
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,830
We should go for 100 years then.

2415
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:47,200
- Gosh.
- Let's go with 500 years.

2416
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:49,540
What do you think, Joon?
They want to play for 50 years.

2417
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,600
You guys are safe
even when it's played...

2418
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,670
- for 50 years.
- Right.

2419
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:52,840
I don't think it matters for me.

2420
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,140
- Really? Okay.
- It doesn't matter.

2421
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:56,710
- For 50 years.
- Okay!

2422
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:57,980
- This round will be for 50 years.
- For 50 years.

2423
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,710
- It'll be for 50 years.
- Okay.

2424
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:02,220
This round will be for 50 years.

2425
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:04,520
- That's big.
- We have to get this one right.

2426
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,220
I should get at least one right.

2427
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,460
Here it comes. Get ready and start!

2428
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:10,660
- Gosh. I got it.
- Okay.

2429
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:13,860
(Who are the three people
in this picture?)

2430
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,700
- Kim Accidentally!
- Kim Accidentally.

2431
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:19,070
Ryu Seung Ryong, Shin Dong Yeob,
Zo In Sung.

2432
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:20,670
I'm right.
(I'm right, aren't I?)

2433
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,440
- He's right.
- He's right.

2434
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,170
- Wrong!
- Kim Tteutto!

2435
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:28,140
- Kim Tteutto!
- Kim First Shoot!

2436
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:30,110
- Kim Tteutto!
- Kim Tteutto was faster.

2437
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,010
- Ryu Seung Ryong,
- Right.

2438
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,720
- Five, four, three,
- Four, three...

2439
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,280
- Choi Min Sik,
- two, one.

2440
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,220
- Park Young Gyu.
- Kim First Shoot!

2441
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,120
- Kim First Shoot!
- I got two right earlier.

2442
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,360
Kim First Shoot!

2443
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,220
- You got one right.
- I did?

2444
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,530
Kim First Shoot!

2445
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,790
(Please look at me.)

2446
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:48,330
Okay. Kim First Shoot.

2447
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:51,430
"Kim First Shoot!"

2448
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:52,800
Shin Dong Yeob,

2449
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:55,670
Kim Yeong Cheol,

2450
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,440
- He's wrong.
- He's wrong.

2451
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,010
- Wrong.
- Lee Kwang Soo.

2452
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,170
- What?
- Wrong! You got one right.

2453
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,210
Really?

2454
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:03,680
(Torn)

2455
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:05,750
Kim Tteutto!

2456
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:08,280
Shin Dong Yeob, Ryu Seung Ryong,

2457
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,580
Cho Sae Ho.

2458
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,750
- It's me?
- Really?

2459
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,150
Those are Sae Ho's ears.

2460
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:16,190
- Really?
- Really?

2461
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:19,530
- Wrong! You got two right.
- Thanks for that.

2462
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:20,630
- Give us a hint.
- Would you like a hint?

2463
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:21,660
Yes.

2464
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,730
The last person you thought
it was Sae Ho...

2465
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,000
is a handsome actor.

2466
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:29,400
- Kim Poison!
- Kim Poison.

2467
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,670
Shin Dong Yeob, Ryu Seung Ryong,
Hyun Bin.

2468
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,880
Kim Poison. You are correct.

2469
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:37,040
You're here to win, aren't you?

2470
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:39,550
You're in your teens now.

2471
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,880
You are... Oh, what?

2472
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,620
- I'm a sperm.
- Right.

2473
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:44,720
- You're amazing.
- Right.

2474
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:45,920
(Joon Sperm, minus 1 year old,
returning to his father)

2475
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,450
(Shin Dong Yeob)

2476
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,860
(Ryu Seung Ryong)

2477
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,020
(Hyun Bin)

2478
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:52,760
(Answer: Shin Dong Yeob,
Ryu Seung Ryong, Hyun Bin)

2479
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:54,030
Thank you.

2480
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,960
- How did I think it was him?
- It was possible.

2481
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,830
(We apologize instead.)

2482
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:00,800
- Please tell us the current score.
- The current score.

2483
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,340
- Se Yoon is 73 years old.
- I've kept my age.

2484
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,170
Joon is minus one year old.

2485
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:06,770
Seon Ho is 122 years old.

2486
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,310
Jong Min is 139 years old.

2487
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:10,140
DinDin is 119 years old.

2488
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:13,150
Sae Ho is 261 years old.

2489
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:15,520
You still have hope.

2490
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,290
As of right now,
these two will get the penalty.

2491
01:20:18,290 --> 01:20:19,890
- Let's go for 100 years.
- Right.

2492
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:21,590
Here's the next one.

2493
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:22,590
Start!

2494
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,990
- What?
- I have no idea.

2495
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:27,730
Are there men and women
mixed up together for this one?

2496
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:29,200
I can't tell at all.

2497
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,930
- I can't tell at all.
- Gosh, I can't tell at all.

2498
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,130
Kim Poison.

2499
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,230
(Joon goes for it.)

2500
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:35,000
Seohyun, Cho Jung Seok, IU.

2501
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,040
Gosh.

2502
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,240
He must be right.

2503
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:41,640
Wrong! But you got two right.

2504
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,140
(He got two right.)

2505
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:45,210
I can see Jung Seok and IU.

2506
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:47,910
There's a mustache. That's a hint.

2507
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:50,020
(Who is the last person
with the mustache?)

2508
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:52,750
Is the one with the mustache
Cho Jung Seok?

2509
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,790
Please move back a bit, everyone.

2510
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:56,920
Does Jung Seok have a mustache?

2511
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,460
Kim Poison.

2512
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,330
Cho Jung Seok, IU, Yoon Jong Shin.

2513
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:02,230
- He's right! Those are his glasses!
- No.

2514
01:21:02,230 --> 01:21:03,830
- No.
- No. It's not his mustache.

2515
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:06,130
- Wrong!
- Kim First Shoot!

2516
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:07,200
- Kim First Shoot!
- What's wrong?

2517
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,470
- Kim First Shoot. Hold on.
- Go for it, Jong Min.

2518
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:10,540
- Cho Jung Seok.
- Right.

2519
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:13,110
- There's also IU...
- Right.

2520
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:14,170
and Haha.

2521
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,210
- He's right!
- Gosh.

2522
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,110
Haha can't appear on our show
as he's in "Running Man."

2523
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:20,310
(Cho Jung Seok, IU, Haha)

2524
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:22,320
Doesn't he wear glasses often?

2525
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,980
Wrong!

2526
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:26,750
- Would you like a big hint?
- That sounds great.

2527
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:28,790
The hint is...

2528
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:31,690
"single."

2529
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:34,090
- Kim Tteutto!
- What?

2530
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:36,760
- My goodness. Will he end the game?
- He got it.

2531
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,130
- Cho Jung Seok, IU,
- Kim First Shoot! Let me answer!

2532
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:41,100
- Cho Jung Seok, IU...
- Kim First Shoot.

2533
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:44,700
- Let me answer! Darn it.
- Defconn.

2534
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,110
- It's Defconn.
- Oh, no.

2535
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,770
(Celebrating it with confidence)

2536
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,440
- Impressive.
- Correct.

2537
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:52,310
(Disappointed)

2538
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:55,480
- Defconn!
- DinDin has survived.

2539
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:56,750
(DinDin survived successfully.)

2540
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:58,650
He did a good job.

2541
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:00,450
That's Defconn.

2542
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:03,590
(Answer: Cho Jung Seok, IU, Defconn)

2543
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:05,290
So DinDin is...

2544
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:06,630
It's confirmed that he will survive.

2545
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:09,000
He is highly likely to survive.

2546
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:13,130
(Excited)

2547
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:15,640
I'm sorry, but this is
the Kim Jong Min special.

2548
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,270
- Cheer up a little.
- Right.

2549
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:21,070
Make it 150 years this time.

2550
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:23,380
This is the last question.

2551
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,780
- Okay.
- Make it 200 years.

2552
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:27,710
What about 200 years?
Sae Ho should have a chance to survive.

2553
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,750
- Make it 200 years. I don't mind.
- Yes.

2554
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:30,980
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

2555
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:32,720
Do you agree to make it 200 years?

2556
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,820
No. I don't agree.

2557
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:37,120
- Let's make it 200 years.
- No.

2558
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,190
- That'd be neat. Make it 200 years.
- It's 30 years.

2559
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:40,590
It's Seon Ho and these two.

2560
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:42,530
It's 1 against 4.

2561
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:45,500
Among these three, the one
who gets it right will survive.

2562
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:47,930
This is the last question
for 200 years.

2563
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:49,770
- But Seon Ho is in the lead.
- You're right.

2564
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,640
We should be on Seon Ho's side
to make him accept the deal.

2565
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,770
- Right.
- Okay.

2566
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,670
- Seon Ho has a team of four.
- Right.

2567
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:57,580
I'm so nervous. I want to go.

2568
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,210
The one with experience should go.

2569
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:00,980
Move over.

2570
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:02,550
(A fierce fight for a better spot)

2571
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,350
This is the last question.

2572
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:05,420
Ready.

2573
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,550
Go.

2574
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:10,390
(The last three people)

2575
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,090
- Kim Accidentally.
- Kim Accidentally.

2576
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:15,400
All right. Yoon Jong Shin,
Car the garden, and Zo In Sung.

2577
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:17,960
Wrong.

2578
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,600
- Two?
- But you got two people right.

2579
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,600
Gosh. Yoon Jong Shin
and Car the garden?

2580
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:23,840
You can do this.

2581
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,440
- Kim Public Service Worker.
- Kim First Shoot. Why you?

2582
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,010
I can do this to help Seon Ho.

2583
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:29,810
Zo In Sung, Yoon Jong Shin...

2584
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:33,210
Cho Jin Woong.

2585
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:36,220
(I need him to get it right!)

2586
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,490
Wrong. You got one person right.

2587
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,450
- What? Really?
- Who did you say?

2588
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:43,320
Zo In Sung and Yoon Jong Shin.

2589
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,160
(Isn't it Zo In Sung
and Yoon Jong Shin?)

2590
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,160
(Sae Ho got 2 people right,
and Se Yoon got 1 person right.)

2591
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,260
(Only 1 of these 2 is
the correct answer.)

2592
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,560
(That means Car the garden is
the correct answer.)

2593
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:53,400
- Kim Public Service Worker. Okay.
- Kim Poison.

2594
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,570
You should stay out of this!

2595
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,270
- We should help Seon Ho.
- What are you doing?

2596
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:01,040
Car the garden, Yoon Jong Shin,
and Jang Hyuk.

2597
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,110
- What?
- What?

2598
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:05,280
- That must be it.
- I see Jang Hyuk.

2599
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,680
I see Jang Hyuk.
Seon Ho, you should come here.

2600
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,480
Come here. Hurry.

2601
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,180
- There's Hyuk.
- Right.

2602
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:13,220
(Are we getting the penalty
just like this?)

2603
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:15,890
- It's obviously him. I'm surprised.
- Kim Poison. Correct.

2604
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:17,860
- Yes!
- Oh, my!

2605
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:19,360
Why did Joon...

2606
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:20,930
(Jong Min and Sae Ho
get the penalty.)

2607
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,700
Gosh, why didn't I see him?

2608
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:26,330
- He's good.
- Lee Chang Sun!

2609
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:27,630
That's true.

2610
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,470
I see Jang Hyuk right away.

2611
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:31,940
- How did you know that?
- My gosh.

2612
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:34,210
Right. I saw
the beard of two people.

2613
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:36,280
- How did he do that?
- My goodness.

2614
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,110
- I'm sorry.
- The penalty will be horrible.

2615
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:41,950
When Life Gives You Age.

2616
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,220
I've aged.

2617
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:44,350
Here's the final result.

2618
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,290
The winner is...

2619
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,620
(Congratulations, Joon.)

2620
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:49,060
He finally won?

2621
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:50,720
- I have no age to deduct.
- Joon.

2622
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:53,460
- My gosh.
- Minus 201 years.

2623
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:54,830
(His final age: Minus 201 years old)

2624
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:57,630
He's the winner
with minus 201 years.

2625
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,100
He's in the sole lead.

2626
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,030
(Good luck, myself!)

2627
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:03,170
Jong Min, 139 years.

2628
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:05,240
Sae Ho, 261 years.

2629
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:08,840
Kim First Shoot and Kim Accidentally
will get the penalty.

2630
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:13,350
If I'm that old, I won't need
any horrible experiences.

2631
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:15,550
I'm over 200 years old.

2632
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:17,820
By the way,

2633
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:20,490
I'm not getting the penalty
because I ate a lot of LA galbi.

2634
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:22,660
I didn't do anything.

2635
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,290
I'm so lucky.

2636
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:27,530
(He had a lot of LA galbi
and rejuvenated himself.)

2637
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:29,730
- Do you want to know the penalty?
- Yes.

2638
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:31,260
It must be something horrible.

2639
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:33,000
You know they say...

2640
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:36,070
that as you get older,
you lose sleep in the morning.

2641
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:37,670
- No.
- What?

2642
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:40,540
My goodness. Thank you, LA galbi.

2643
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:43,510
- My gosh. That's too harsh.
- It's the worst.

2644
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:47,010
You two, who have aged a lot
and lost sleep in the morning,

2645
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:50,220
will go up the mountain
overlooking Daema Island...

2646
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:51,620
and watch the sunrise...

2647
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,590
tomorrow morning.

2648
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:54,820
(They get to watch the sunrise.)

2649
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:56,590
You'll watch the sunrise
tomorrow morning.

2650
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:01,860
(I managed to avoid hiking!)

2651
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,930
- DinDin.
- Thank you.

2652
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:05,300
- Thank you.
- Seriously...

2653
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:07,330
- I'm so happy for us.
- Thank you.

2654
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:09,040
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

2655
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:11,270
(System off)

2656
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:13,840
Actually, I'm a morning person,

2657
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,740
- so I like hiking in the morning.
- Okay.

2658
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,810
(Shutting his eyes tight)

2659
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:19,950
Isn't this nice?
When everyone else is asleep,

2660
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:21,480
I get to experience something.

2661
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,750
Isn't that great?

2662
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,120
(He's not in the mood
for a forced excitement.)

2663
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,190
- If it's hiking,
- Yes.

2664
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:29,520
you can have only one person
get the penalty.

2665
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:31,620
- He's right.
- They're really...

2666
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,060
I'll bet my life on it!

2667
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:34,430
(He totally agrees.)

2668
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:36,830
Let's pick one person
to get the penalty!

2669
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:38,030
Let's make it simple. One person.

2670
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:39,330
- Do you want to try?
- Okay!

2671
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:40,330
- Can we really do that?
- Let's do that.

2672
01:26:40,330 --> 01:26:42,470
But you will have to do
the work of two people.

2673
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:44,000
- Okay.
- Of course.

2674
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,270
Someone will be doing that.

2675
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:46,870
(He means Sae Ho.)

2676
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:48,780
- It will be fun.
- Their faces look fun already.

2677
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,010
(It's fun to watch.)

2678
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:52,280
- You should go.
- Why are you telling me to go?

2679
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:53,280
You go.

2680
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:59,290
(Jong Min
who has gotten all the penalties?)

2681
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:00,550
Let's go!

2682
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:06,860
(Sae Ho who became
the oldest member...)

2683
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:08,760
(with the clover bomb?)

2684
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,500
This is really nerve-racking.

2685
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,630
- Ready.
- It's nerve-racking.

2686
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:13,870
(The final match)

2687
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:15,000
- Start!
- Okay.

2688
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,170
- My gosh. What's that?
- Oh, dear.

2689
01:27:16,170 --> 01:27:17,900
(The last question
of When Life Gives You Age)

2690
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,840
Who on earth is that? Gosh!

2691
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:20,840
(This is difficult.)

2692
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,740
- I know two people.
- This is crazy. It's too easy.

2693
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:24,440
I got all three of them.

2694
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:27,810
(They seem clueless.)

2695
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:29,650
(And Se Yoon
suddenly starts acting cute.)

2696
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:30,950
Everyone.

2697
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:32,950
There's no way they don't know.

2698
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:34,990
- I think...
- I'm not sure about one person.

2699
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:36,520
Sae Ho doesn't know one of them.

2700
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:39,860
(The pink cheeks are
particularly noticeable.)

2701
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:47,770
(Se Yoon is 1 of the 3 people.)

2702
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,600
Kim First Shoot.
(The person from the photo)

2703
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:52,240
Kim First Shoot.

2704
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:54,340
(Laughing)

2705
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:55,580
Kim First Shoot.

2706
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:57,810
- Bong Joon Ho.
- My gosh.

2707
01:27:57,810 --> 01:27:59,210
- He's there.
- I see him.

2708
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:00,980
DinDin.

2709
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,120
- What?
- What?

2710
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:04,320
- Wrong.
- He chose DinDin?

2711
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:06,220
- Okay.
- You got one person right.

2712
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:07,850
I got it. Kim Accidentally.

2713
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:09,220
- Kim Accidentally.
- Director Bong Joon Ho.

2714
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:10,220
Yes.

2715
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:11,660
- Park Seo Jun.
- Yes.

2716
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:12,890
And...

2717
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:15,160
(Se Yoon)

2718
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:18,600
(Sae Ho, do you not know me?)

2719
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:19,970
(Sulky)

2720
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:21,000
- Isn't that him?
- Who's the other one?

2721
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,070
It will be hilarious if one of them
gets nervous and throws up.

2722
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,070
(Sae Ho, it's me.)

2723
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:28,340
- Gosh, the lips...
- Say it. Who is it?

2724
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,110
That's it.

2725
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,050
Did I get two people right?

2726
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:33,450
(You still don't get it?)

2727
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:35,380
You got one person right.

2728
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:37,550
(Moon Se Yoon)

2729
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:38,850
(Bong Joon Ho)

2730
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:41,690
(Director Bong Joon Ho
is also correct!)

2731
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:42,990
(One person
with a particularly small face)

2732
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:44,120
Who is the other one?

2733
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,830
I feel like my heart will burst.

2734
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:47,090
- DinDin, do you get it?
- Yes.

2735
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:48,360
- I saw it right away.
- Then...

2736
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:51,100
Bong Joon Ho, Bookku Ddoong,
and G-DRAGON.

2737
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:52,500
- No.
- No?

2738
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,770
You got two people right.

2739
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:56,100
(Let me try.)

2740
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:00,240
(What was that?)

2741
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:07,210
(Shy Joo)

2742
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,580
(He just laughs.)

2743
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:13,350
(He's shy, but he's good
at expressing himself.)

2744
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:15,220
I found two people.

2745
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,820
But who is the one with the cheeks?

2746
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,530
Sae Ho has no idea.

2747
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:21,190
Kim First Shoot.

2748
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,630
(Jong Min gives it a try.)

2749
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:23,830
- Be careful.
- Are you sure?

2750
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:24,960
Don't say it if you're not sure.

2751
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:26,970
You might end up giving him a hint.

2752
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:28,100
I can't do this.

2753
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:32,110
- Just be brave and do it.
- I think he will steal my answer.

2754
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,240
- I think...
- I'm not sure about one person.

2755
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:35,840
Sae Ho has no idea
who the one person is.

2756
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,310
I don't recall those lips.

2757
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:38,440
(Why are they laughing?
Something's strange.)

2758
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,450
(It's you?)

2759
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:45,520
(I got you.)

2760
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:47,190
This is unbelievable.

2761
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:48,320
- Now that I know it...
- What's going on?

2762
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,490
I'm confused all of a sudden.

2763
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:52,090
(Bong Joon Ho)

2764
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:53,360
(Moon Se Yoon)

2765
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,530
(Choi Woo Shik)

2766
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:57,330
(Answer: Bong Joon Ho,
Choi Woo Shik, Moon Se Yoon)

2767
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,770
- No.
- Who is it?

2768
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:01,400
This is...

2769
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,800
- Jong Min!
- Yes.

2770
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:05,300
- No. Kim First Shoot.
- Yes, Kim First Shoot.

2771
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:06,770
- Bong Joon Ho.
- Yes.

2772
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:08,340
Choi Woo Shik.

2773
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,940
(Did he get it right?)

2774
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:13,750
(He got it right!)

2775
01:30:14,110 --> 01:30:16,520
(Now he has to say Bookku Ddoong.)

2776
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:18,220
(Is it Choi Woo Shik?)

2777
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:20,190
- Save it.
- Save it?

2778
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:21,220
(DinDin, who doesn't know
about Choi Woo Shik, stops him.)

2779
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:24,560
(No, you have to say it.)

2780
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,490
(Jong Min, we can't go hiking!)

2781
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:29,560
DinDin.

2782
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:31,960
How many?

2783
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:36,570
- You got two people right.
- Bong Joon Ho and Choi Woo Shik.

2784
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,440
(I was so close!)

2785
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:41,040
(A silent scream)

2786
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:43,710
You have to time it!

2787
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,340
Hey! You have to time it!

2788
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,550
(I can't let Sae Ho say it.)

2789
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:47,650
Time it!

2790
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:49,480
(He can try again in 30 seconds.)

2791
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,880
Time it!

2792
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,190
Kim Accidentally.

2793
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:53,620
Kim Accidentally

2794
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:55,790
(What is wrong with him?)

2795
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,120
Time it.

2796
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,130
(Runaway locomotive)

2797
01:31:00,490 --> 01:31:02,800
(DinDin is dying.)

2798
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,530
- Bong Joon Ho.
- Wait.

2799
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:06,100
Hold on.

2800
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:09,100
- I don't know. Bong Joon Ho.
- Kim First Shoot.

2801
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,270
- Bong Joon Ho.
- Kim First Shoot.

2802
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:11,300
(Now I have to say Bookku Ddoong.)

2803
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,740
- Bong Joon Ho.
- Kim First Shoot.

2804
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:14,670
Choi Woo Shik, ZICO.

2805
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:15,980
- Kim First Shoot.
- ZICO.

2806
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:18,180
Kim First Shoot!

2807
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:21,950
- Kim First Shoot!
- Bong Joon Ho, Choi Woo Shik,

2808
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:23,120
- ZICO.
- He's happy.

2809
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,520
(Isn't that correct?)

2810
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,620
- Wrong.
- Go ahead.

2811
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:29,660
Kim First Shoot!

2812
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:31,990
- Party people!
- What?

2813
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:33,390
All right.

2814
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:34,760
(Confused)

2815
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:35,960
So this is how it ends.

2816
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,760
- Five.
- You'll watch the sunrise alone.

2817
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,000
- Four.
- You'll be going.

2818
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:40,370
- Bong Joon Ho!
- Bong Joon Ho.

2819
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:41,470
- Choi Woo Shik.
- Choi Woo Shik.

2820
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:43,740
Moon Se Yoon!

2821
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:44,800
Bookku Ddoong!

2822
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:47,570
Is that correct?

2823
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:49,310
Correct.

2824
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:51,210
(Jong Min got it right.)

2825
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:52,480
Kim Jong Min!

2826
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:55,010
I see it.

2827
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:57,180
I see it!

2828
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:00,490
(It's 6 Jong Min Special's
greatest celebration.)

2829
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:01,590
Kim Jong Min!

2830
01:32:02,090 --> 01:32:03,960
I see Bookku Ddoong's bob.

2831
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,330
(Only now...)

2832
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:09,400
(Mocking them to the end)

2833
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:11,730
Wasn't that the first thing you saw?

2834
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,070
"Should I say Choi Woo Shik or not?"

2835
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,200
- That kept spinning.
- I was confused.

2836
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:17,700
Choi Woo Shik...

2837
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:21,910
The penalty tomorrow...

2838
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:24,040
is for Kim Accidentally.

2839
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,010
- Accidentally.
- Accidentally.

2840
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:27,880
Does he go dressed like this?

2841
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,720
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

2842
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,820
How can I go anywhere in this?

2843
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:35,720
- It's an effective look.
- Stand there like this.

2844
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,860
- In a sleeveless vest.
- You'll look adorable.

2845
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:39,360
Well done, everyone.

2846
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:43,200
We'll take a short break
before moving on.

2847
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,260
- My gosh.
- Okay.

2848
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:45,600
(Next episode)

2849
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:49,140
(You received
a mobile wedding invitation.)

2850
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:52,170
(2 Days and 1 Night's eldest
with 18 years experience...)

2851
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:54,410
(will celebrate
with an advanced wedding.)

2852
01:32:55,410 --> 01:33:00,710
(The viewers are invited.)

2853
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,620
(What video is this?)

2854
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,750
(Jong Min.)

2855
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:07,850
(You're getting married now too?)

2856
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:15,330
(Many people sent
surprise messages to wish him well.)

2857
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:19,870
(It's time for the groom
to walk down the aisle.)

2858
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:21,800
(Before that...)

2859
01:33:23,070 --> 01:33:24,070
Oh, my gosh.

2860
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:32,580
The groom Kim Jong Min
will bow to his parents.
