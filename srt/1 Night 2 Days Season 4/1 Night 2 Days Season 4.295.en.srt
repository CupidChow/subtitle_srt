3
00:00:08,112 --> 00:00:11,242

4
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:13,411

00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:17,682
(gets most right.)

8
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,652
(History Kim is now Seoul Kim too.)

9
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:21,492
(Call me Seoul Kim.)

00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:24,821

(The 1 Night 2079 FW Fashion Show will be held.)

14
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:33,972
(You must look futuristic.)

15
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:39,072
(Time to shop: 15 minutes)

16
00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:40,971
(Complete a look...)

17
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:43,282
(in your own style.)

18
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:45,342
(The show is held at DDP.)

19
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:47,652
(A huge crowd gathered.)

20
00:00:48,212 --> 00:00:49,982
(Not even money...)

21
00:00:50,722 --> 00:00:53,192
(can get you a seat to this show.)

22
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:55,352
(Ever seen a show like this?)

23
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,522
(Full of excitement)

24
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:00,832
(It's getting heated up.)

25
00:01:01,432 --> 00:01:03,932
(Who will become the star of the show?)

26
00:01:05,262 --> 00:01:09,002
(2 Days 1 Night)

27
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:12,812
What's this? Jong Min's coming.

28
00:01:13,612 --> 00:01:15,542
You're so handsome!

29
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:17,611
- Congratulations on the marriage.
- You're handsome!

30
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:19,092
- Congratulations!
- You're handsome!

31
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:23,282

33
00:01:31,722 --> 00:01:34,632

(A formal suit jacket...)

35
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:42,342
(with biker shorts.)

36
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:46,272
(A sporty athleisure look)

37
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,341
You look great from a distance.

38
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,612
Your performance. Show us.

39
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:52,712
(A performance?)

40
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:55,352
(Flinging open)

41
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,922
Hang on. That's too much.

42
00:01:58,082 --> 00:01:59,092
Jong Min.

43
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:01,491
Show us.

44
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:02,722
(Cute antics)

45
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,432
(Here's my heart.)

46
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:10,462
(The spectators are satisfied.)

47
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:11,962
This is madness.

48
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:13,083
(He reaches the photo wall.)

49
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:15,272
That right now...

50
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:18,472
is our team's most expensive look.

51
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:23,512
(20 dollars, 9 dollars, 10 dollars)

52
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:27,381
He went for the cool items.

53
00:02:27,382 --> 00:02:29,652
(Dongmyo Flea Market's high-end collection)

54
00:02:30,452 --> 00:02:31,452
What a pose.

55
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:33,651
- Okay, now cheer.
- Greet the gallery.

56
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:34,791
Entertain the fans.

57
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:37,292
Hello!

58
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,162
(Sudden belly-button greeting)

59
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,061
(Visually attacked)

60
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:46,301
We can't air that, can we?

61
00:02:46,302 --> 00:02:47,302
(We apologize instead.)

62
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:50,972
The ball of laughter's here.

63
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:54,911
(At the very same time...)

64
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:59,552
(All eyes are on one man.)

65
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:08,022
(A standout pair of legs)

66
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:20,532
(Team Lim Joon Ho, Cho Sae Ho)

67
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:22,501
He looks better covered up.

68
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,602
(Wary of competition)

69
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:26,642
(A red padded jacket for the FW season...)

70
00:03:27,372 --> 00:03:29,582
(paired with ethnic shorts)

71
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,482
His face is hidden.

72
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:35,712
(A blue hat with a hole)

73
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:40,652
(A futuristic walk)

74
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:44,422
(It'll be a hit in 2079!)

75
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:47,332
I like the feel of this look.

76
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:50,632
- Hey, this is...
- Is he in his underwear?

77
00:03:51,402 --> 00:03:52,642
He's not wearing any underwear?

78
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:55,971
(2 dollars, 15 dollars, 18 dollars, 4 dollars)

79
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:57,301
That's a good idea.

80
00:03:57,302 --> 00:03:59,441
- Look at the center camera.
- What a good idea.

81
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:01,218
(He rules the photo wall with his sentimental look!)

82
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,481
That's a good idea.

83
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:03,711
(The fashionista has the gallery talking.)

84
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,842
What a good idea.

85
00:04:06,352 --> 00:04:08,581
Go over there. Go and greet them.

86
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,482
I just saw him with his eyes open.

87
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:13,092
Hello.

88
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:15,192
(Squealing)

89
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,022
(It suddenly feels like "King of Mask Singer.")

90
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:21,462
They didn't recognize him at first.

91
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,831
Sae Ho has nice legs.

92
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,602
Yes. They're sculpted.

93
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,302
Everyone.

94
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:32,401
We have the stars of the 2079 FW Fashion Show...

95
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:35,311
in one place at last.

96
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:36,811
How is this a look of a star?

97
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:38,911
That's nonsense.

98
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,852
The result of this fashion show...

99
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:43,652
decides your mode of transportation...

100
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:46,592
to the next location.

101
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:48,951
What are they?

102
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:50,832
- Dressed like this?
- What do the winners get?

103
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:53,732
(Win and take a taxi.)

104
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:56,131
- And the losers?
- I bet it's public transport.

105
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:57,361
(Take the subway dressed like this.)

106
00:04:57,362 --> 00:04:58,762
That's the worst.

107
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,372
To make sure the results are fair,

108
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:06,312
the spectators here will vote for you.

109
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:12,182
(Each box has the name and face of one member.)

110
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:16,482
This is the year 2079, and it's the FW season.

111
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:20,752
I teamed up with DinDin and Joon.

112
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:24,062
Se Yoon, Seon Ho, and Jong Min are another team.

113
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:28,362
Our theme was the idea that we could go to Mars,

114
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:32,332
so we're called "From Hwaseong in Gyeonggi Province to Mars."

115
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:36,042
We're dressed as visitors to Mars,

116
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:39,571
and Joon's dressed as our bodyguard.

117
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,572
(The bodyguard)

118
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:41,741
- You look cool!
- Thank you.

119
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,081
(Greeting the voters under the bodyguard's watchful eye)

120
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:46,252
- Thank you.
- Please vote for us.

121
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:49,222
Let me explain our concept.

122
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:52,022
We can sleep anywhere we want.

123
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,091
In the year 2079,

124
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:55,092
(Trying to be appealing)

125
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:56,621
we can sleep in comfort.

126
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,921
(The time is almost up.)

127
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:58,922
You...

128
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,932
- Make something up.
- Seon Ho...

129
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:03,801
He's a free spirit. He's just wearing whatever he wants.

130
00:06:03,802 --> 00:06:04,802
(Trying to show off his charm again)

131
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:06,608
He's just following his vibe with this outfit.

132
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,532
As for me,

133
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:13,212
I went for the mix of sporty and formal looks.

134
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:14,841
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

135
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,112
- Jong Min will turn 50 soon.
- Hello. Right.

136
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:18,681
- Please help him out.
- Yes. Help us.

137
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:19,911
- Hello.
- If we lose this time,

138
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,328
- there's no coming back for us.
- Hello.

139
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:22,481
We can barely get a meal on this show.

140
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,881
- Please help us out.
- I'm begging you.

141
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:25,021
- I'm a fan.
- My gosh.

142
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:26,352
Let's begin now.

143
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:27,791
Let's go!

144
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,121
(Cho Sae Ho, Moon Se Yoon, Yoo Seon Ho, )

145
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,421
(DinDin, Lee Joon, and Kim Jong Min)

146
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:31,491
Let's go!

147
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,732
(The spectators begin to vote.)

148
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:35,232
Let's do this.

149
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:40,231
(Who will win the crowd's votes?)

150
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:42,402
- Who did you vote for?
- Moon Se Yoon.

151
00:06:42,742 --> 00:06:43,771
Can I ask why?

152
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:47,072
He'll be considered handsome in 2079.

153
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:50,682
I voted for Sae Ho.

154
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:55,611
The hat and shorts he's wearing now are very futuristic.

155
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:56,782
He's got the best outfit.

156
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:58,481
To share my criteria for evaluations,

157
00:06:58,482 --> 00:07:01,652
I thought Jong Min had a pretty cool aura.

158
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,092
Given his image, I got the feeling that...

159
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,632
he'd be doing exactly that in 2079. So I voted for him.

160
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,062
I voted for DinDin.

161
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:12,601
- I could fall in love.
- He was cute.

162
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:13,631
(Which member received the most votes?)

163
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:14,932
Okay. Thank you.

164
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,141
All right, everyone.

165
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:17,142
(The voting is closed.)

166
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:19,042
We gave out 50 ping pong balls.

167
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,071
The team with more ping pong balls will win this mission.

168
00:07:22,072 --> 00:07:23,712
- Please let that be us.
- Let's begin...

169
00:07:23,842 --> 00:07:26,952
with Seon Ho and DinDin. Pull a ball out one at a time.

170
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:28,911
- Do you have a lot of balls?
- No cheating.

171
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:30,121
- I've got a lot.
- Pull out one at a time.

172
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:31,222
One at a time.

173
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,391
No cheating.

174
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:34,392
(Targeting DinDin)

175
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:35,491
How can I cheat with this?

176
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,122
- Okay.
- I'm not Uri Geller.

177
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:39,862
- All right. One.
- One.

178
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:42,231
- Two.
- Let's speed this up.

179
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:43,361
- Okay. Two.
- Two.

180
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,561
(Team New and Old Love: 2, Team Lim Joon Ho: 2)

181
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:45,962
- Three.
- Three.

182
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:47,471
- Four.
- Four.

183
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:48,731
(Team New and Old Love: 4, Team Lim Joon Ho: 4)

184
00:07:48,732 --> 00:07:49,742
- Five.
- Five.

185
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:51,442
- That's a lot.
- Seon Ho has a lot of balls.

186
00:07:51,443 --> 00:07:52,843
- Six.
- How do you have this many?

187
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:57,212
(It seems it will be a close match even from the get-go.)

188
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,481
- What?
- Seven.

189
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:00,511
- Seven.
- Do you have more?

190
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:02,251
- I have more.
- Pull them out fast.

191
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:03,252
- This is it for DinDin.
- Eight.

192
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:04,321
How many do you have now?

193
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:05,551
- It's 6 to 6.
- Okay. It's 6 to 6.

194
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,991
- Okay. Next.
- All right. One.

195
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,022
Seven.

196
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:09,721
- I'm caught up, right?
- Yes.

197
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:10,962
- Eight.
- Eight. I'm done.

198
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:12,292
- Okay.
- Let's go.

199
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:13,461
- Nine.
- Nine.

200
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:14,838
(Team New and Old Love: 9, Team Lim Joon Ho: 9)

201
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,101
- Ten.
- Ten.

202
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:17,538
(Se Yoon from Team New and Old Love continues on.)

203
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:18,932
- Stop pranking us.
- Eleven.

204
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,532
- Eleven.
- He's got more than I expected.

205
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:23,272
They were so kind with their votes.

206
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:25,602
The crowd was way too generous with them, right?

207
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:27,342
Twelve.

208
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:28,871
(Team New and Old Love: 11, Team Lim Joon Ho: 12)

209
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:29,981
- Twelve.
- Okay.

210
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:31,681
(Team New and Old Love: 12, Team Lim Joon Ho: 12)

211
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:32,682
Thirteen.

212
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:34,358
(Team New and Old Love: 12, Team Lim Joon Ho: 13)

213
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:35,451
- You got two votes?
- Great.

214
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:36,521
- Thirteen...
- Fourteen!

215
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:38,021
- They must pull out 1 more.
- Pull out 1 more.

216
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:39,081
- Go.
- Then...

217
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:40,291
- Start at 13.
- This is 13.

218
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:41,321
- One.
- Wait.

219
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:42,392
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen.

220
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:44,021
- Fourteen.
- We're almost done.

221
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,292
- Fourteen.
- It's almost over.

222
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:47,492
- Joon got a lot of votes.
- Fourteen.

223
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:48,992
Go.

224
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,702
Fifteen.

225
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:52,431
(Team New and Old Love: 15, Team Lim Joon Ho: 15)

226
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,672
- Come on.
- Fifteen.

227
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:55,871
- Jong Min. Can I have hope?
- Sixteen.

228
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:57,042
Is that 15?

229
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:59,042
(Fidgeting)

230
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:00,711
- Okay. Take it out.
- That's 17.

231
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:02,211
(Team New and Old Love: 17, Team Lim Joon Ho: 16)

232
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:03,212
- Seventeen.
- Okay.

233
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:04,912
He seems relaxed.

234
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:07,211
(Team New and Old Love: 17, Team Lim Joon Ho: 17)

235
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,382
It's coming out.

236
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:10,082
Eighteen.

237
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:13,992
Jong Min got a lot of votes from the middle-aged women.

238
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:16,021
- Nineteen.
- Nineteen.

239
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,161
- What?
- You take it out first.

240
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:18,638
- Joon got a lot of votes too.
- You take it out first.

241
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:19,691
- You take it out 1st.
- Yes, you go 1st.

242
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,692
- Do you have it?
- Twenty.

243
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,031
- Just one.
- Do you have more?

244
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:23,102
Please...

245
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:25,131
(Will he have more balls?)

246
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,432
Please...

247
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:28,502
(Curious)

248
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:30,641
- He has more.
- His hand is touching the bottom.

249
00:09:30,642 --> 00:09:31,901
(He has more balls!)

250
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:33,011
Gosh, there's one.

251
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:34,012
That's a total of 40 balls now.

252
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:35,941
- There are 10 balls left.
- I bet he has 2 left.

253
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,511
- Twenty-one.
- My gosh.

254
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:38,611
- Twenty-one.
- Please...

255
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:39,612
- Please don't prank us.
- Did you run out?

256
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:40,912
Seoul Kim.

257
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,022
(Kim Jong Min)

258
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,692
(Will he have more ping pong balls left?)

259
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:51,192
(Ta-da!)

260
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:53,368
Why does he keep taking it out like it's a magic trick?

261
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,272
- We're at 22 now, right?
- Do you have 1 more?

262
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:56,632
You just need one more.

263
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:01,572
(A flustered look)

264
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:03,572
(Did Joon run out of balls?)

265
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:05,172
Did you run out?

266
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:07,442
- He has it. My gosh.
- Okay.

267
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:09,141
- Joon.
- You go first.

268
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,541
- Gosh, you...
- No. You go first.

269
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,582
- Twenty-three.
- Joon.

270
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:14,082
Jong Min, there is no miracle. Right?

271
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:16,222
- Calm down.
- There's no miracle, right?

272
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:17,422
No way.

273
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,151
- There are only four balls left.
- For real?

274
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:22,621
- He keeps doing it like a trick.
- There are four left!

275
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,121
- There are four balls left?
- Yes.

276
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:25,622
We could win or lose by one.

277
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:27,392
This is driving me crazy.

278
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:31,461
He doesn't have any more. He ran out.

279
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:32,701
- Of course, he has more.
- Okay.

280
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:34,231
- Jong Min doesn't have any left.
- Gosh.

281
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:36,218
No way. Will he pull one out like a magic trick again?

282
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:38,642
- He's making it inside.
- No way. Don't do the magic trick.

283
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:40,241
- I...
- Let's pray.

284
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:41,572
- Please.
- Maybe, he has it.

285
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,042
Please have one more.

286
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:45,581
- Jong Min. Seoul Kim.
- No way.

287
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:46,951
- Seoul Kim.
- He doesn't have any.

288
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:48,992
- No way. My gosh.
- Will it come out of his mouth?

289
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:50,958
- My gosh.
- Will it come out of his mouth?

290
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:52,951
(Jong Min manages to play defense.)

291
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,151
Gosh, what is this?

292
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:56,191
- Are we tied? What's this?
- Gosh, I had it in the box.

293
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:57,521
- We're tied.
- It's 24 to 24.

294
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,191
- We have 48 balls out, right?
- Yes.

295
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,231
- We have 48 balls out.
- We must see who still has one.

296
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:02,232
Gosh, let go.

297
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:03,501
- Hold on.
- They must take it out together.

298
00:11:03,502 --> 00:11:05,578
- They must know the results.
- They must take it out together.

299
00:11:05,602 --> 00:11:06,732
One, two...

300
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:08,031
(Joon takes something out.)

301
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:10,571
- He has it.
- My gosh. He's got it.

302
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:12,042
(Jong Min also takes something out.)

303
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:14,972
(Which one of them is holding onto a ping pong ball?)

304
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:21,211
(One ping pong ball will decide...)

305
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:24,752
(the match they worked so hard to win.)

306
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:28,192
(Which team will end the mission with a smile?)

307
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:29,900
Are you going to make one up?

308
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:32,027
(One ping pong ball will decide...)

309
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:33,793
(the match they worked so hard to win.)

310
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:37,412
(Which team will end the mission with a smile?)

311
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,732
Are you going to make one up?

312
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:42,612
(Joon manages to play defense.)

313
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,682
Blow on it.

314
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:50,021
- All right.
- Okay.

315
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:51,291
- My gosh.
- Thank you.

316
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:52,421
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

317
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:54,662
- Okay.
- My gosh.

318
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:56,732
What is this?

319
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:57,961
Did we lose by two then?

320
00:11:57,962 --> 00:11:59,762
- That's crazy.
- We lost by two.

321
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,902
This means...

322
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:05,072
Team New and Old Love received 24 votes.

323
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:07,941
Team Lim Joon Ho received...

324
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:09,688
- It wasn't a huge difference.
- twenty-six votes.

325
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:10,871
- My gosh.
- Hold on.

326
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:11,911
- If we got them to pity us more...
- This is...

327
00:12:11,912 --> 00:12:13,412
hurting my pride more than expected.

328
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:15,741
- They...
- We didn't get as many as expected.

329
00:12:15,742 --> 00:12:17,782
That's the thing. One can never understand fashion.

330
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:19,052
Right.

331
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:20,951
- I'll see you at the next spot.
- The next spot...

332
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:21,982
Okay.

333
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:24,398
If you guys don't mind, could you do something for us?

334
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:26,861
When Jong Min shouts, "2 Days,"

335
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,221
could you shout, "1 Night?"

336
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:29,932
- Sure.
- Thank you.

337
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,372
Please tell them our show airs on Sunday at 6:10pm.

338
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:35,161
Our show will air on Sunday at 6:10pm.

339
00:12:35,162 --> 00:12:36,672
Please watch our show.

340
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:38,431
- Okay.
- Thank you.

341
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:40,152
It's been a while. Let's shout it together.

342
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:41,702
2 Days...

343
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:42,741
- 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

344
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:43,771
Thank you.

345
00:12:43,772 --> 00:12:45,342
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

346
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:46,811
Be happy!

347
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:48,411
(We'd like to thank everyone for their participation.)

348
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:49,481
That was so funny.

349
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:50,781
(Before we head out to the next spot...)

350
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:51,912
Everyone.

351
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:55,481
You guys have to come to the next spot on your own.

352
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:56,691
What about our clothes?

353
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,822
- You'll go dressed like this.
- But I'm really hot.

354
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,761
- I'll unzip my jacket.
- Okay.

355
00:13:01,762 --> 00:13:03,442
- It's really hot.
- Take off your jacket.

356
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:04,592
Then...

357
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:08,401
- That looks weirder.
- What do you mean it's weird?

358
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:09,571
We'll go to the next spot...

359
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:11,031
- in this outfit?
- Yes. In the same outfit.

360
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:12,842
He's not wearing any pants right now.

361
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,071
When he walked,

362
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:15,101
- his underwear shows.
- My underwear shows.

363
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:17,642
- Your clothes...
- Look at this.

364
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:20,181
- It's really hot.
- Hey, my outfit is better.

365
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:21,242
It's way too hot.

366
00:13:21,282 --> 00:13:23,851
The winning team will travel via taxi.

367
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:25,052
- Okay.
- Yes.

368
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:29,081
The losing team will travel via subway.

369
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:31,022
- In this outfit?
- In the same outfit.

370
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:33,692
- This is... What about Seon Ho?
- Then...

371
00:13:33,962 --> 00:13:36,031
- I'll see you at the next spot.
- My underwear shows. Seriously.

372
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,062
- Okay.
- But...

373
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:39,561
Okay. We'll get going. Get there safely.

374
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:40,761
- See you later.
- Bye.

375
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:41,831
- There will be traffic.
- Be careful.

376
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:43,571
Take the subway, Joon. There will be traffic.

377
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,572
No.

378
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,631
- Why not?
- I'll take the taxi.

379
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:46,701
- Really?
- Yes.

380
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,171
He'd be perfect in the subway.

381
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:49,172
- See you later.
- Let's go.

382
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:50,241
- I got the cards.
- Bye.

383
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:51,242
Okay.

384
00:13:51,472 --> 00:13:53,212
This is connected to the subway station?

385
00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:56,252
This is the worst.

386
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:59,622
You know, I feel pretty confident with the sunglasses.

387
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,352
- Can you take them off?
- No.

388
00:14:02,322 --> 00:14:04,122
- It's 2 Days 1 Night.
- There it is.

389
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:06,362
(Oh, hello.)

390
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:09,192
This is so embarrassing.

391
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:11,291
- Seriously.
- My gosh.

392
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:14,262
You have to tell us where we're going first.

393
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:15,901
- Where are we going?
- Don't you know how old we are?

394
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:17,531
We're just following you without knowing our destination.

395
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:19,171
We'll give you more information...

396
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:20,812
once you reach Exit 3-1 at Ichon Station.

397
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:22,942
- That's DinDin's neighborhood.
- Dongbu Ichon-dong?

398
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,612
Wait. Are we going to DinDin's house?

399
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:27,611
(They wait for the subway.)

400
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:29,812
(Awkward)

401
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:32,482
(Glancing around)

402
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,292
(There are a lot of people in the subway.)

403
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:37,752
(Stealing glances)

404
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,461
(Shy)

405
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,661
- Hello.
- Hello.

406
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:43,191
(Fascinated)

407
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:44,362
Hello.

408
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:47,302
(Showing an awkward smile)

409
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:49,602
Today is the most embarrassing day of my life.

410
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:50,871
Same here. This is crazy.

411
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:52,071
(They wish they could crawl into a hole.)

412
00:14:52,072 --> 00:14:54,072
Can I borrow them for three minutes?

413
00:14:54,202 --> 00:14:55,202
- I'm sorry.
- Just for three minutes.

414
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:56,241
- I'm sorry.
- Just this once.

415
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:57,311
- Let's trade.
- No.

416
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:58,341
Let me borrow them just this once.

417
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:00,612
- It's coming.
- Will it stop here?

418
00:15:01,242 --> 00:15:02,342
Gosh, it's packed.

419
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:04,912
There are so many people today.

420
00:15:05,282 --> 00:15:06,321
This is driving me crazy.

421
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,151
(The thought of getting on it embarrasses them.)

422
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:09,692
I should've bought sunglasses too.

423
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:13,191
(We filmed with the cooperation of Seoul Metro.)

424
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:14,222
Okay.

425
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:17,862
(They nervously get on the subway cart.)

426
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,532
(Glancing around)

427
00:15:19,762 --> 00:15:21,901
(Shy)

428
00:15:21,902 --> 00:15:24,571
(As if they're guilty of something, they keep lowering his head.)

429
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:26,801
(Staring at the floor)

430
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,342
How many stations do we have to go?

431
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:30,012
- Where...
- One, two,

432
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:32,711
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine. Nine stations.

433
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:34,081
Gosh, that's a lot. It will take 30 minutes.

434
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:35,482
- This is crazy.
- Nine stations?

435
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:37,411
(As he's embarrassed, he tries to sit down.)

436
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:38,581
(Where do you think you're going?)

437
00:15:38,582 --> 00:15:40,451
- What are you doing?
- Okay.

438
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:41,921
You've got to be kidding me. Please sit here.

439
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:42,998
(Don't pretend you're not with us.)

440
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:45,022
(The embarrassment is killing him.)

441
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:46,991
(Intrigued)

442
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:48,162
Hello.

443
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:50,432
This is Yoo Seon Ho.

444
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:52,561
Be quiet.

445
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:53,701
(You're embarrassing me. What are you doing?)

446
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,732
Thank you.

447
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:57,032
(Embarrassed)

448
00:15:58,172 --> 00:16:01,042
(They just don't know what to do.)

449
00:16:01,902 --> 00:16:03,641
- We're on Line Four, right?
- This is Oido bound.

450
00:16:03,642 --> 00:16:04,771
Oido?

451
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:06,912
I got it. It will be here in five minutes.

452
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,912
- Why don't you stand together?
- It's...

453
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:11,111
One, two, three.

454
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:12,281
(While waiting for the taxi, )

455
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:13,451
(they use the spare time to take pictures.)

456
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:14,821
- You look like a mom.
- Gosh, it came out nicely.

457
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:15,881
Sae Ho, you look like a mom the way you take pictures.

458
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:16,951
And the outfit too.

459
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:18,952
- Seriously.
- Like a mom traveling in Europe.

460
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:20,891
It came out really well.

461
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:22,492
You look like a mom traveling in Europe.

462
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:23,861
It's okay when Korean people walk past us.

463
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:26,201
But it's really embarrassing when foreigners walk past us.

464
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,401
They were all laughing.

465
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:28,561
It feels like this is who I am.

466
00:16:28,562 --> 00:16:29,972
They were laughing pretty hard.

467
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:32,431
- This is better than the subway.
- That's the worst.

468
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:33,442
This is...

469
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:34,572
That's the one.

470
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,002
Hello, sir.

471
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:37,512
Hello.

472
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:40,541
- I know where we're going.
- Really?

473
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,782
We're going to Dongbu Ichon-dong.

474
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:45,111
We're going to the spot I recommended.

475
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:46,181
- Really?
- Really?

476
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:47,481
- We're going there now?
- Yes.

477
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:48,922
As for this spot,

478
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,792
it's the favorite of the locals.

479
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:53,591
If you ask them to pick their favorite food spot,

480
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:54,792
this must be it.

481
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:56,021
- Really?
- Yes.

482
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:57,431
- A local restaurant has tasty food.
- So...

483
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:58,731
this place is completely local.

484
00:16:58,732 --> 00:16:59,931
There are so many good restaurants.

485
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:01,638
There are a lot of good places in Dongbu Ichon-dong.

486
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:04,032
(Meanwhile, Team New and Old Love is traveling via subway.)

487
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:06,371
Can he take a picture with you?

488
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:07,372
Sure. Come here.

489
00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:09,442
- Come here.
- Thank you.

490
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:10,941
We're from Masan.

491
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:12,072
- Masan?
- Yes.

492
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:15,612
This will be a trendy style soon.

493
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:17,952
It will be trendy in 2079.

494
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:19,651
Are you heading to the museum?

495
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:21,121
- You came all the way from Masan?
- Yes.

496
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:23,021
To educate your children?

497
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:24,892
- Really?
- My gosh. Seriously.

498
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,052
- Seodaemun Prison History Hall.
- Seodaemun.

499
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:28,461
You went there to study our history.

500
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:30,232
Have you seen us on TV?

501
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:32,092
- We watch 2 Days 1 Night.
- You do?

502
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:34,331
(She often watches 2 Days 1 Night.)

503
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:35,802
Who's your favorite member?

504
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,031
(Shyly pointing at Seon Ho)

505
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:40,072
- Really? How about a handshake?
- Shake his hands.

506
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:42,242
- Take a picture with him.
- Come here.

507
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:47,712
- Give her your bag.
- Do you want this?

508
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:49,341
- This was three dollars.
- "Do you want this?"

509
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:51,812
We bought this for three dollars at Dongmyo.

510
00:17:52,382 --> 00:17:54,382
- Three dollars at Dongmyo...
- Or how about this?

511
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:55,751
- This...
- That was a dollar.

512
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:56,791
Really?

513
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,822
It's quite fun when you keep it under your arm.

514
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:01,962
(In no time, they arrive at Samgakji Station.)

515
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,162
(Glancing)

516
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:06,602
My gosh.

517
00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:08,431
I startled you, didn't I?

518
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:09,631
(I'm sorry about that.)

519
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:11,072
I startled myself too.

520
00:18:11,902 --> 00:18:13,671
(They thought he was a weirdo.)

521
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:15,071
Is there a button to close the doors?

522
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:16,072
(Embarrassed)

523
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:17,142
Okay.

524
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:20,682
(Awkward)

525
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,741
- We have 2 stations left, right?
- Yes, 2 stations.

526
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:24,251
- Okay.
- We're almost there.

527
00:18:24,252 --> 00:18:25,972
(They want to get off as soon as possible.)

528
00:18:26,582 --> 00:18:29,592
(Awkwardness fills the air.)

529
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:32,121
Ask them what they think of Se Yoon.

530
00:18:32,122 --> 00:18:34,022
What do you think about Se Yoon?

531
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:35,361
- Who?
- Se Yoon.

532
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:37,442
I doubt they have an opinion about me. Why ask them?

533
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:39,262
A comedian who sings well.

534
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:43,001
- Gosh, she knows about you.
- A comedian who sings well.

535
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:44,372
What about Jong Min?

536
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:49,442
(Putting on a kind gaze)

537
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:51,112
A funny singer?

538
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:53,881
I'm a comedian who sings well. He's a funny singer.

539
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,058
(Their special talents are switched.)

540
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:56,282
What are you filming?

541
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,952
- 2 Days 1 Night.
- 2 Days 1 Night.

542
00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:00,151
- It's your favorite show.
- Really?

543
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:01,181
(She didn't think it was 2 Days 1 Night...)

544
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,281
(because of the awful outfits.)

545
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:03,891
I think you will be on our show.

546
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,351
- Are you okay with being on TV?
- Me?

547
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,121
- Yes. Can we air this part?
- She was already on TV many times.

548
00:19:07,122 --> 00:19:08,122
- Really?
- Who?

549
00:19:08,123 --> 00:19:09,291
- Which show?
- Which show?

550
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:10,531
- She's a professional golfer.
- I'm a professional golfer.

551
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:11,532
Really?

552
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:13,302
Can you check his swing?

553
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:15,302
(Flustered at his request for a golf lesson)

554
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:18,672
What do you think?

555
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,342
His lower body...

556
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:21,901
His lower body is shaking?

557
00:19:21,902 --> 00:19:22,941
- They shouldn't move, right?
- My lower body is shaking.

558
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:24,041
Keep your legs fixed.

559
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:25,211
- Don't move your legs.
- My legs.

560
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:26,481
(He tries again while keeping his legs fixed.)

561
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:27,642
(Surprised)

562
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,481
- You're great.
- Really? Thank you.

563
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:31,511
Seriously. I bet we'll see you often on sports news.

564
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:33,021
We'll definitely see you on TV. We'll root for you.

565
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:34,651
- She's going to be this.
- Gosh, that's...

566
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:36,092
- What's that?
- A national athlete.

567
00:19:36,452 --> 00:19:37,452
- My gosh.
- A national athlete?

568
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:39,368
- I'll root for you.
- Can I shake your hand proactively?

569
00:19:39,392 --> 00:19:40,392
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

570
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:42,798
- Please bring glory to our country.
- Let's get good energy from her.

571
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:44,961
- Thank you.
- Can you tell us your name?

572
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:46,131
- What?
- Can we get your name?

573
00:19:46,132 --> 00:19:47,132
Jeong Da Won.

574
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:48,531
- Jeong Da Won.
- Da Won.

575
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:49,871
- Da Won.
- She's our future.

576
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:50,872
Yes.

577
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:52,401
(They finally arrive at Ichon Station.)

578
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:53,541
Let's get off.

579
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:54,671
- We'll get going.
- Okay.

580
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:55,918
- Thank you.
- Do we get off here?

581
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:57,411
Get off.

582
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,472
Thank you.

583
00:20:01,142 --> 00:20:02,142
My gosh.

584
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:03,652
(Give back my sunglasses.)

585
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:06,051
Jeong Da Won. It'd be crazy...

586
00:20:06,052 --> 00:20:07,651
- to see her on the news later.
- Jeong Da Won.

587
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:08,751
- Golfer Jeong Da Won.
- Yes.

588
00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:10,432
- Good luck, Jeong Da Won!
- Jeong Da Won.

589
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:13,261
Jeong Da Won. Gosh, we'll root for you.

590
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:14,461
Exit 3-1.

591
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:16,238
(Team New and Old Love arrives at Ichon Station.)

592
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:17,491
- We're almost there.
- We're getting close.

593
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:19,262
- Are we in Dongbu Ichon-dong?
- Yes.

594
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:20,931
I was born at that hospital.

595
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:23,102
- The one on the left.
- You can remember your birth?

596
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,771
That's where I was born.

597
00:20:24,772 --> 00:20:27,801
This must feel surreal for you that we're filming here.

598
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:29,871
Right. I always wanted...

599
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:32,211
to film our show here and explore this area for a day.

600
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:33,212
I see.

601
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:35,511
This is the show I've been on the longest,

602
00:20:35,512 --> 00:20:37,012
and it's my favorite show.

603
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:39,782
Filming the show in my hometown was a dream of mine.

604
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,221
Good for you. This must feel surreal.

605
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:43,791
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

606
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,252
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

607
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:47,361
Get your juniors to come out and greet us.

608
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:49,462
I don't come to my neighborhood looking like this.

609
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,892
- Gosh, this is embarrassing.
- By the way...

610
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:54,401
So you used to walk around here, right?

611
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:56,572
I did. That's the middle school I graduated from.

612
00:20:57,002 --> 00:20:59,332
Gosh, that? Your middle school...

613
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,042
That's my middle school.

614
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:03,241
- Gosh. I can't come here like this.
- Are they already here?

615
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:04,711
- They're already here.
- Right here.

616
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:05,912
The tteokbokki restaurant.

617
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:07,981
- This is the place.
- I can't look like this here.

618
00:21:07,982 --> 00:21:09,812
- This is my regular spot.
- I see.

619
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:12,342
I'm a resident here. I can't walk around looking like this.

620
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:14,781
If I run into my mom, she'll scold me.

621
00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:16,151
- You're here.
- Hello.

622
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:17,851
- Hello.
- Hello.

623
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:18,991
- Hello.
- Gosh, hello.

624
00:21:18,992 --> 00:21:20,021
Nice to meet you.

625
00:21:20,022 --> 00:21:22,021
- I brought my show here.
- My gosh.

626
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:23,792
- Hello.
- Hello.

627
00:21:24,162 --> 00:21:25,691
(How will the food taste...)

628
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:27,201
(from the tteokbokki restaurant DinDin recommended?)

629
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,461
- You're already here.
- What?

630
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:29,972
- You're here.
- You got here fast.

631
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:31,671
- Of course.
- We got here a while ago.

632
00:21:31,672 --> 00:21:33,301
- We got here a while ago.
- There was so much traffic.

633
00:21:33,302 --> 00:21:34,671
Do you know how fast the subway is?

634
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:35,842
- Really?
- Hey.

635
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:37,611
- What?
- Did you recommend this spot?

636
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:39,272
- I recommended this place.
- Really?

637
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:42,081
Actually, I've heard of this tteokbokki restaurant...

638
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:43,751
from a long time ago.

639
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:46,581
Here's the brief history. The granny started...

640
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:48,902
- Right. The street stall.
- selling tteokbokki in a cart.

641
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:50,391
- She started to make good money.
- Okay.

642
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,722
Afterward...

643
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:54,162
It was this big back then.

644
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:55,821
- That's how big it was back then.
- That's how she started?

645
00:21:55,822 --> 00:21:56,861
- In this location?
- Yes.

646
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:57,891
- It was about 6.6m²?
- It was about 6.6m²?

647
00:21:57,892 --> 00:21:59,592
This used to be a comic book store.

648
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:01,061
She bought the comic book store...

649
00:22:01,062 --> 00:22:02,422
- and expanded.
- She set up here?

650
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:04,531
There was another tteokbokki restaurant next to this.

651
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,271
She also bought that place.

652
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:09,192
- That's how she expanded.
- One step at a time.

653
00:22:09,302 --> 00:22:11,711
(She started her business in a handcart...)

654
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,681
(and expanded little by little over time.)

655
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:16,481
Afterward, her son took over the business.

656
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:18,282
- Her son?
- He's running it now.

657
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:21,221
The Second Period Tteokbokki is the tastiest...

658
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:23,821
because that's when rice cakes are perfectly cooked.

659
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:25,521
- They soak up the sauce.
- Okay.

660
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:27,291
It tastes so good when you eat it then.

661
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:29,692
I used to sneak out of school to have tteokbokki.

662
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:31,391
When my teachers came to look for me,

663
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,512
she used to help me hide and tell them I wasn't here.

664
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:34,831
She's loyal.

665
00:22:34,832 --> 00:22:36,531
- If you think about it, - Just that day?

666
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:37,631
Tteokbokki restaurants are usually in front of schools.

667
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:39,372
- Students are the main clientele.
- Right.

668
00:22:39,572 --> 00:22:41,271
But most of the customers here are adults.

669
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:43,001
- Right. I bet.
- That means this place is legit.

670
00:22:43,002 --> 00:22:44,712
Both adults and students come here.

671
00:22:45,312 --> 00:22:47,181
- That's the owner.
- Hello.

672
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:48,241
- Hello.
- My gosh.

673
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,151
- Ma'am, do you remember him?
- Yes.

674
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:51,851
- Do you remember him?
- You look great.

675
00:22:51,852 --> 00:22:53,281
- Gosh.
- You grew into a fine man.

676
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:54,451
- You think so?
- Yes.

677
00:22:54,452 --> 00:22:55,452
- He's...
- He didn't grow much.

678
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:57,252
- What? I know.
- He didn't grow that tall.

679
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,991
I also saw her earlier this year.

680
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:00,691
- Really?
- Really?

681
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:04,262
So her tteokbokki restaurant is...

682
00:23:04,462 --> 00:23:06,661
one of the most famous spots in our neighborhood.

683
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:08,431
Jang Won Young and I talked...

684
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:09,771
about this place too.

685
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,471
Really? Jang Won Young came here too?

686
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:12,472
Yes.

687
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:13,801
- Many celebrities came here.
- So...

688
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:15,371
- We'll enjoy the food today.
- Sure.

689
00:23:15,372 --> 00:23:16,972
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

690
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:20,811
(What kind of mission will they do at the 4th 1 Night Ribbon Spot?)

691
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:22,211
- Aren't you hungry?
- Yes.

692
00:23:22,212 --> 00:23:23,251
- It's driving me crazy.
- I'm super hungry.

693
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:24,711
- Why am I hungry?
- Will it be another quiz?

694
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,351
Se Yoon, we should be. It's past 3:30pm.

695
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:27,521
- Really?
- But this is our lunch.

696
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:28,881
- I digested the bread so fast.
- Yes.

697
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:30,222
Only our sugar spiked.

698
00:23:31,052 --> 00:23:33,161
You'll play the Lunch Game...

699
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,961
while having our lunch.

700
00:23:34,962 --> 00:23:36,061
- What?
- Really?

701
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:38,161
- Yes. If you execute...
- What kind of game is it?

702
00:23:38,162 --> 00:23:40,101
The mission well, you can have a filling meal.

703
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:43,131
It's called the Tteokbokki Food Mafia.

704
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:44,831
- Food Mafia?
- Tteokbokki Food Mafia.

705
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:46,131
- Food Mafia?
- Like the Mafia Game?

706
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:48,141
That's right. Just like the Mafia Game,

707
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:49,701
one team will take the mafia roles.

708
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:51,611
The other team will take the detective roles...

709
00:23:51,612 --> 00:23:52,812
and figure out the secret.

710
00:23:53,512 --> 00:23:56,011
(The game will go on with their tables covered up.)

711
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:58,312
Two members of Team Food Mafia...

712
00:23:58,552 --> 00:24:00,651
can eat only for one minute.

713
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:04,121
To figure out who's eating, Team Detectives will receive hints.

714
00:24:04,122 --> 00:24:05,621
During the meal,

715
00:24:05,622 --> 00:24:07,121
they can either ask a question or give an instruction.

716
00:24:07,122 --> 00:24:08,991
Each member will get a turn.

717
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:10,831
After one minute, Team Detectives...

718
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:12,962
must single out the member who didn't eat.

719
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:14,701
If the detectives are right, that's it for their meal.

720
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:16,231
- Then...
- Gosh, that's the worst.

721
00:24:16,232 --> 00:24:17,712
If the detectives make a wrong guess,

722
00:24:17,902 --> 00:24:20,702
Team Food Mafia will get another minute.

723
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:22,271
- We can take turns to eat.
- Yes.

724
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,611
We can definitely confuse them.

725
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:24,772
- Right.
- Just for a minute.

726
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:26,682
- What if it ends in one round?
- Yes.

727
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,912
- That's it?
- Yes. Naturally.

728
00:24:28,982 --> 00:24:31,712
You know what? This just crossed my mind.

729
00:24:31,852 --> 00:24:33,852
Tell us which one of you isn't going to eat.

730
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:35,481
- Then the other two can eat.
- Yes.

731
00:24:35,482 --> 00:24:37,692
We can say, "Seon Ho didn't eat."

732
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:39,791
We'll say,

733
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,161
"DinDin isn't going to eat." The other two will eat.

734
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:43,191
- You can say it was Sae Ho then.
- "It was Sae Ho."

735
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:44,431
We can keep going back and forth.

736
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:45,861
- Everyone can eat then.
- Let's help each other out.

737
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:47,601
- Right.
- Gosh, you're a genius.

738
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:48,631
- But...
- Let's help each other out.

739
00:24:48,632 --> 00:24:50,902
(Director Joo is listening to their sly tactic.)

740
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,732
Then this game won't be entertaining.

741
00:24:53,572 --> 00:24:54,641
(Laughing)

742
00:24:54,642 --> 00:24:55,801
It will be entertaining...

743
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:57,048
- to watch us one-up you guys.
- Exactly.

744
00:24:57,072 --> 00:24:59,311
How is it fun when we can't eat?

745
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:01,181
- DinDin, you're the best.
- Don't you like the idea?

746
00:25:01,182 --> 00:25:02,588
- I like it.
- Isn't it a good idea?

747
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:04,382
- Tell us with a wink or something.
- Right.

748
00:25:04,752 --> 00:25:06,051
Give us some kind of sign.

749
00:25:06,052 --> 00:25:07,922
- The one who isn't eating...
- However,

750
00:25:08,282 --> 00:25:10,591
someone could betray us.

751
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,191
- Then he's a jerk.
- Right.

752
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,561
That's not allowed.

753
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:15,491
This place is one of my childhood memories.

754
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:17,291
- I wouldn't fool anyone.
- The look in his eyes...

755
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:18,661
- Let's do it.
- We have to be honest.

756
00:25:18,662 --> 00:25:20,342
- The old lady is watching us.
- And so...

757
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:22,162
Earlier on the subway,

758
00:25:22,502 --> 00:25:24,672
we met someone who reads tarot cards and faces.

759
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:27,102
- She said we'll be lucky today.
- I see.

760
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:29,401
She said that she was studying Jong Min's face.

761
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,411
- My face.
- Really?

762
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:31,542
- Yes.
- Who said that?

763
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:32,711
I asked her why.

764
00:25:32,712 --> 00:25:35,312
It was because Jong Min became more successful than she expected.

765
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,282
- Seriously?
- Where?

766
00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:40,382
She thought that I was unusual because my success was unexpected.

767
00:25:40,522 --> 00:25:42,181
- So I said, "Is that so?"
- Really?

768
00:25:42,182 --> 00:25:43,821
She just nodded in silence.

769
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:45,328
(We hope that things go well for him today.)

770
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:48,691
(Let's go and eat for real this time.)

771
00:25:48,692 --> 00:25:52,192
I'm really hungry. It's driving me crazy.

772
00:25:52,732 --> 00:25:54,002
This is how it's served.

773
00:25:54,632 --> 00:25:55,762
What is it?

774
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:57,871
It looks so good. My goodness.

775
00:25:57,872 --> 00:25:59,631
- This is insane.
- We have to eat this.

776
00:25:59,632 --> 00:26:01,502
- There it is.
- This is unbelievable.

777
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:03,201
This is insane.

778
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:04,872
(The basis of tteokbokki)

779
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:07,911
(On top of tteokbokki made with flour cakes)

780
00:26:07,912 --> 00:26:09,381
(Fried dumplings, a boiled egg, fried sweet potatoes, )

781
00:26:09,382 --> 00:26:11,252
(fried ugly dumplings, fried gimari)

782
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,512
(Once tteokbokki sauce is poured over it, it's ready.)

783
00:26:14,622 --> 00:26:15,622
(Tteokbokki's forever companion)

784
00:26:15,623 --> 00:26:17,591
This is insane. It looks so delicious.

785
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:21,322
(Sundae)

786
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:25,261
(And sweet and sour jjolmyeon)

787
00:26:25,262 --> 00:26:26,431
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

788
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,831
(The food looks amazing.)

789
00:26:27,832 --> 00:26:29,762
Jjolmyeon has to get mixed.

790
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:31,771
Can we watch you mix it?

791
00:26:31,772 --> 00:26:33,778
- We'll let them watch up to mixing.
- That should be okay to watch.

792
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,562
- Goodness.
- So that you can buy more time.

793
00:26:36,142 --> 00:26:37,471
Add some broth to it.

794
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:38,971
Add some fishcake broth.

795
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,172
So that you can mix it easily.

796
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:41,581
It's driving me crazy.

797
00:26:41,582 --> 00:26:42,841
(I want to eat right now.)

798
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:44,812
There's the food. We'll close the curtain now.

799
00:26:45,752 --> 00:26:48,252
(Team Lim Joon Ho has to pick their food mafia.)

800
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,991
(Blocking the view completely)

801
00:26:51,992 --> 00:26:53,151
Okay.

802
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:54,392
Se Yoon, you can't see, right?

803
00:26:54,562 --> 00:26:56,392
After playing rock-paper-scissors,

804
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:58,761
- we'll pretend to be disappointed.
- Okay.

805
00:26:58,762 --> 00:27:00,701
After that, we can...

806
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,831
- Okay.
- I got it.

807
00:27:01,832 --> 00:27:03,331
- All three of us.
- Okay.

808
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,678
(Team Lim Joon Ho comes up with a strategy.)

809
00:27:04,702 --> 00:27:06,432
- We can listen to the sounds.
- Right.

810
00:27:06,572 --> 00:27:08,341
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

811
00:27:08,342 --> 00:27:09,642
(Screaming)

812
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:12,442
(Giving a disappointing performance)

813
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:14,712
Wait a minute. I'm stressed out.

814
00:27:15,512 --> 00:27:16,611
(Joon: I'm stressed out.)

815
00:27:16,612 --> 00:27:17,812
What did you say?

816
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,682
- Wait a minute.
- It can't be helped.

817
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:20,952
Let's go.

818
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:24,222
It's either Sae Ho or him.

819
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:25,592
- Joon?
- Or it's Joon.

820
00:27:25,652 --> 00:27:26,652
Do you know why?

821
00:27:26,653 --> 00:27:28,261
You can't change the food mafia when it's decided.

822
00:27:28,262 --> 00:27:30,462
- Okay.
- We already made our decision.

823
00:27:30,892 --> 00:27:33,092
Jong Min has an idea.

824
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:36,161
Get ready, set...

825
00:27:36,162 --> 00:27:37,882
(Team Food Mafia gets to eat for 1 minute.)

826
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,242
(Slurping)

827
00:27:43,512 --> 00:27:44,712
This sound is...

828
00:27:46,212 --> 00:27:47,441
(The oddly familiar sound of someone smacking his lips)

829
00:27:47,442 --> 00:27:48,942
- Can we ask them questions?
- Yes.

830
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:51,252
- Joon, is it good?
- Ask them questions.

831
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:53,522
Yes.

832
00:27:55,252 --> 00:27:58,252
Sae Ho, could you sing a verse of "Where Are You Now?"

833
00:27:59,152 --> 00:28:02,022
(You're drunk right now)

834
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:06,662
(Sae Ho is singing without reserve.)

835
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:08,562
(It's hard to tell.)

836
00:28:08,702 --> 00:28:09,902
It must be Sae Ho.

837
00:28:10,302 --> 00:28:11,302
- DinDin.
- You have ten seconds.

838
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:13,401
- Ask him to rap.
- Could you rap a line?

839
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:14,682
- DinDin.
- We're asking DinDin.

840
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:17,671
(Rapping "DinDin Is DinDin" immediately)

841
00:28:17,672 --> 00:28:19,471
He's full of saliva.

842
00:28:19,472 --> 00:28:20,481
Okay.

843
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:22,211
(Does he seem full of saliva because he's eating?)

844
00:28:22,212 --> 00:28:23,881
Two, one.

845
00:28:23,882 --> 00:28:25,952
(Eating for 1 minute is over.)

846
00:28:26,552 --> 00:28:29,021
(Among...)

847
00:28:29,022 --> 00:28:31,091
(these members, )

848
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:33,692
(who is the food mafia?)

849
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:38,391
(Poker face)

850
00:28:38,392 --> 00:28:39,691
I think Sae Ho ate.

851
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:41,602
He put some sauce on himself on purpose.

852
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:43,671
(The tteokbokki sauce on him is obvious.)

853
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:45,331
He smeared it on himself on purpose,

854
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:47,271
but Sae Ho ate. Let's exclude him.

855
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:48,592
- And Joon.
- Let's go with Joon.

856
00:28:48,872 --> 00:28:51,111
In my opinion, it's DinDin.

857
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:52,441
No, it's definitely Joon.

858
00:28:52,442 --> 00:28:54,611
When Joon was responding,

859
00:28:54,612 --> 00:28:56,742
I could tell that he had food in his mouth.

860
00:28:57,752 --> 00:29:00,052
(Asking questions a moment ago)

861
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:01,082
(Yes...)

862
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:04,392
(It sounded like his mouth was full.)

863
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:06,252
My guess is Joon.

864
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:07,862
- I think it's Sae Ho.
- Okay.

865
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:11,332
I don't think DinDin got to eat.

866
00:29:11,492 --> 00:29:13,361
He sounded a little dry.

867
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:14,882
- In that case...
- What do you think?

868
00:29:15,662 --> 00:29:17,571
- Give us a moment.
- It could also be Joon.

869
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,008
- Wait a minute.
- It's definitely Joon.

870
00:29:19,032 --> 00:29:21,301
As soon as they started, someone ate ramyeon.

871
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,642
- He slurped it.
- Exactly.

872
00:29:22,772 --> 00:29:25,312
Joon doesn't make any sound when he eats.

873
00:29:25,912 --> 00:29:27,611
(Dumbfounded)

874
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:29,612
- Right.
- There's nothing in his teeth.

875
00:29:30,082 --> 00:29:32,252
- It's definitely Joon.
- Why do you think so?

876
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,521
He said that he was stressed out.

877
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,152
He was telling the truth.

878
00:29:35,652 --> 00:29:37,452
(Did he say the truth unintentionally?)

879
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:39,121
- Okay.
- Gosh,

880
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:40,391
it's definitely Joon.

881
00:29:40,392 --> 00:29:41,491
Okay, I'll go with Joon.

882
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:42,861
- I also pick Joon.
- If a pro is so sure,

883
00:29:42,862 --> 00:29:44,868
- we should follow him. Okay.
- He's onto something.

884
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:45,961
- He has an intuitive feeling.
- Okay.

885
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:47,461
Joon is the one who didn't eat.

886
00:29:47,462 --> 00:29:48,822
- The one who didn't eat.
- Right.

887
00:29:48,932 --> 00:29:50,031
One, two, three.

888
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:51,471
- The food mafia is Joon.
- The food mafia is Joon.

889
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:53,348
- You didn't get to eat.
- You didn't get to eat.

890
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:54,471
You didn't eat, did you?

891
00:29:54,472 --> 00:29:55,842
(Will Joon be the food mafia?)

892
00:29:56,402 --> 00:29:58,472
The food mafia is...

893
00:29:58,872 --> 00:30:00,712
(Who is it?)

894
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:02,282
Joon.

895
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,452
(The food mafia is Joon.)

896
00:30:04,912 --> 00:30:06,451
(Team New and Old Love's reasoning was correct.)

897
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:08,351
- Did we get it right?
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

898
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:09,352
What?

899
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:10,651
- Now...
- I mean...

900
00:30:10,652 --> 00:30:12,392
- It was Joon.
- You were right.

901
00:30:12,822 --> 00:30:15,062
- I'm so good at guessing today.
- He was exactly right.

902
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:16,561
How did you do that?

903
00:30:16,562 --> 00:30:18,061
You sounded like your mouth was full when you responded.

904
00:30:18,062 --> 00:30:19,162
He did a good job.

905
00:30:19,562 --> 00:30:22,902
(1 minute ago)

906
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:25,432
(It wasn't acting. He was being honest.)

907
00:30:25,872 --> 00:30:28,842
(While Sae Ho and DinDin were enjoying the food, )

908
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:32,012
(the food mafia Joon had to watch them.)

909
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:34,242
(Joon, is it good?)

910
00:30:34,742 --> 00:30:36,782
(His amazing acting fooled everyone.)

911
00:30:37,012 --> 00:30:39,111
How did Jong Min know that intuitively?

912
00:30:39,112 --> 00:30:40,351
- I know.
- When Jong Min insists,

913
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:42,021
there's a reason behind it.

914
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:44,322
All of us acted on purpose.

915
00:30:44,922 --> 00:30:46,192
So they can't eat anymore?

916
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:47,622
- Goodness.
- No.

917
00:30:47,622 --> 00:30:48,622
(No)

918
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:51,791
(The meal is over, and Joon couldn't even get a bite.)

919
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,161
(Their positions switch.)

920
00:30:53,162 --> 00:30:55,002
Let's do it. Don't say a word.

921
00:30:55,162 --> 00:30:56,561
- Okay, don't react at all.
- Don't react at all.

922
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:58,548
Only facial expressions are allowed towards the camera.

923
00:30:58,572 --> 00:31:02,572
(Their strategy is not giving any hint.)

924
00:31:02,672 --> 00:31:03,912
(Quiet)

925
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:08,282
(They can't tell based on the rock-paper-scissors.)

926
00:31:08,682 --> 00:31:09,712
All right.

927
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:13,352
Get ready, set...

928
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:17,022
(Their eating for 1 minute starts.)

929
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:20,152
(They're so careful that they don't make a sound from eating.)

930
00:31:20,522 --> 00:31:23,292
(I don't hear anything.)

931
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,932
- We'll ask questions now.
- Okay.

932
00:31:25,532 --> 00:31:26,892
Jong Min, what are you eating?

933
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:29,032
I'm not eating.

934
00:31:29,732 --> 00:31:31,632
Se Yoon, could you sing us a song?

935
00:31:32,232 --> 00:31:34,102
- Sing for us.
- Teach me

936
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:37,972
(Coughing while singing)

937
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:39,512
Seon Ho, is it good?

938
00:31:39,972 --> 00:31:41,042
It's very good.

939
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,552
(Seon Ho is a citizen who's eating.)

940
00:31:45,382 --> 00:31:46,382
(Slurping)

941
00:31:47,882 --> 00:31:49,122
(Slurping)

942
00:31:49,482 --> 00:31:50,751
(Yoo Seon Ho)

943
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:53,252
He just ate. He slurped.

944
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:55,722
(The detectives heard sounds from Seon Ho's side.)

945
00:31:56,062 --> 00:31:59,562
(He's eating diligently without realizing that he got caught.)

946
00:31:59,732 --> 00:32:01,001
(Now...)

947
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,331
(the food mafia candidates are Se Yoon...)

948
00:32:04,332 --> 00:32:08,442
(and Jong Min.)

949
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:13,412
(One of them is pretending to eat.)

950
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:14,982
(Exclaiming)

951
00:32:15,282 --> 00:32:16,482
It's so good.

952
00:32:17,212 --> 00:32:20,382
(There's exaggeration in his voice.)

953
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:23,182
Three, two, one.

954
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,692
Time is up.

955
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:28,722
One. Time is up.

956
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:30,932
(Shouting all of a sudden)

957
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:32,062
Time is up.

958
00:32:34,932 --> 00:32:36,901
(What is he doing?)

959
00:32:36,902 --> 00:32:37,932
Seriously?

960
00:32:38,972 --> 00:32:42,342
(Covering his mouth)

961
00:32:42,472 --> 00:32:44,512
(What's wrong with Jong Min?)

962
00:32:45,012 --> 00:32:46,292
- I got it.
- It's so delicious.

963
00:32:46,912 --> 00:32:48,611
- It's Jong Min.
- Right, it's Jong Min.

964
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:49,932
Let me explain why it's Jong Min.

965
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:54,022
When he opened his mouth, it was pink inside his mouth.

966
00:32:54,582 --> 00:32:55,951
I could tell that he didn't eat anything.

967
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:57,328
(DinDin saw that his mouth was pink inside.)

968
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,022
It was completely pink.

969
00:32:59,592 --> 00:33:01,692
(Seon Ho is eating right in front of them.)

970
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:03,221
- What is he doing?
- Keep eating.

971
00:33:03,222 --> 00:33:04,992
- What are you doing?
- He can't help it.

972
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:07,242
I must be out of my mind. What's wrong with me?

973
00:33:07,732 --> 00:33:09,501
Jong Min, show us your mouth. We showed you ours.

974
00:33:09,502 --> 00:33:10,732
It has to be Jong Min.

975
00:33:11,932 --> 00:33:13,632
(A strange behavior out of nowhere)

976
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:17,072
(What is wrong with Jong Min?)

977
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,942
(Dumbfounded)

978
00:33:20,142 --> 00:33:21,911
- It has to be Jong Min.
- It's Jong Min.

979
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:22,941
Let me explain.

980
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:25,851
Se Yoon wiped his mouth, but you can tell that...

981
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:27,822
there's sauce smeared on him by 1mm.

982
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:28,981
Do you know what's more important?

983
00:33:28,982 --> 00:33:31,302
- You see the red spot on his scarf?
- On Se Yoon's scarf.

984
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:34,962
(There's some red sauce on his scarf.)

985
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:37,161
(Flustered)

986
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:39,191
Let's be bold and go with our guess. It's Jong Min.

987
00:33:39,192 --> 00:33:40,231
I think it's him.

988
00:33:40,232 --> 00:33:41,361
- I also think it's Jong Min.
- Let's go with it.

989
00:33:41,362 --> 00:33:42,401
One, two, three.

990
00:33:42,402 --> 00:33:43,431
- Jong Min.
- Kim Jong Min.

991
00:33:43,432 --> 00:33:45,902
- You didn't get to eat food.
- You didn't eat food.

992
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:48,501
(Is Jong Min the food mafia?)

993
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:49,502
All right.

994
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:51,742
The person who didn't eat was...

995
00:33:51,912 --> 00:33:53,142
Is it Se Yoon?

996
00:33:55,312 --> 00:33:58,412
(Which one of them is the food mafia?)

997
00:33:58,801 --> 00:34:00,409
The person who didn't eat was...

998
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:01,699
Is it Se Yoon?

999
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:07,239
(Which one of them is the food mafia?)

1000
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:09,308
It's Se Yoon.

1001
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:10,378
(The food mafia is Se Yoon.)

1002
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:11,509
It's Se Yoon.

1003
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,109
(Unexpected)

1004
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:17,018
(Team New and Old Love's defense was successful.)

1005
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:18,618
- Hey, you.
- What were you doing?

1006
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:19,619
I was just...

1007
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,619
- We won with a 50-percent chance.
- Hey.

1008
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:23,969
I smeared it on purpose. I fooled you, didn't I?

1009
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:26,209
- Se Yoon, you're amazing.
- I smeared it on purpose.

1010
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:32,929
(Se Yoon smeared some sauce on his scarf meticulously.)

1011
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:35,929
(On top of that, there was Jong Min's method acting.)

1012
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,938
It's too late now, but I was suspicious of Se Yoon.

1013
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:40,138
- Gosh.
- His acting was better.

1014
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,638
I was too busy eating.

1015
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,678
- Let's do it one more time.
- Jong Min, did you...

1016
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,138
Did you try to eat at the end on purpose?

1017
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,249
I did it on purpose.

1018
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:49,179
Jong Min, you surprised me too.

1019
00:34:49,549 --> 00:34:51,579
I didn't expect him to do this.

1020
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:53,988
- You have one more minute.
- Se Yoon smeared it on himself.

1021
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,949
- Let's try it.
- You may eat for another minute.

1022
00:34:56,459 --> 00:34:59,219
(Tteokbokki Food Mafia Round 2, Team New and Old Love)

1023
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:01,329
- Don't react.
- All right.

1024
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:05,729
(Jong Min is the citizen who eats.)

1025
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:09,839
(The food mafia is Seon Ho.)

1026
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:11,269
Get ready.

1027
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,308
Set.

1028
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:14,869
(We have to guess correctly this time.)

1029
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:16,309
(Slurping)

1030
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:20,749
(Devouring as soon as they start)

1031
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:22,979
Se Yoon ate.

1032
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,919
Se Yoon, could you sing "Teach Me?"

1033
00:35:26,949 --> 00:35:28,749
- Now.
- I can't sing right now.

1034
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:31,058
He really ate.

1035
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:32,295
(Citizen Se Yoon is confirmed.)

1036
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:34,039
Seon Ho, sing one of Sung Si Kyung's songs.

1037
00:35:34,629 --> 00:35:37,599
(Singing immediately)

1038
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:41,029
(I think it's Seon Ho.)

1039
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:43,069
Jong Min, please sing your new song.

1040
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:44,698
I'm sorry, but I can't.

1041
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:46,069
(He's acting again.)

1042
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,869
- It must be Jong Min.
- I also think that it's him.

1043
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,049
Three, two, one.

1044
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:57,479
(It's Jong Min again.)

1045
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:01,049
(He was being cautious without eating.)

1046
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:05,289
(Exaggerating his reaction a little too late)

1047
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:08,058
(Jong Min did it again.)

1048
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:10,459
(He's about to spit it out.)

1049
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,528
What are you doing?

1050
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:13,928
Are you making it obvious again?

1051
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:15,009
(Why aren't you hiding it?)

1052
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:17,169
Show us your mouth.

1053
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:20,369
(Repeating his strange behavior)

1054
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:21,968
(Se Yoon is dying of laughter.)

1055
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:23,938
- I forgot about Jong Min...
- Show us your teeth.

1056
00:36:23,939 --> 00:36:26,179
- Do you know why?
- I'm grateful to them...

1057
00:36:26,509 --> 00:36:28,589
because they give us a 50-percent chance of winning.

1058
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:30,979
(Are they our alley or enemy?)

1059
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:33,018
I think it's Seon Ho.

1060
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:35,195
- The jjolmyeon is delicious.
- Who do you think it is, Sae Ho?

1061
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:36,619
It could also be Jong Min.

1062
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:39,319
- Shall we go?
- Okay.

1063
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:40,788
One, two, three.

1064
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:42,828
- Jong Min.
- My goodness.

1065
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:44,205
(They choose Jong Min as the food mafia.)

1066
00:36:44,229 --> 00:36:48,329
(Will their reasoning be correct this time?)

1067
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:50,568
- It's me.
- Okay.

1068
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:52,069
- What were you doing?
- Darn it.

1069
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,538
(Team Lim Joon Ho's reasoning failed again.)

1070
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:55,308
- It's difficult.
- Please close the curtain.

1071
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:56,379
Goodness.

1072
00:36:56,509 --> 00:36:59,038
If the same team loses again,

1073
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,079
- I'll let you enjoy the food.
- Thank you.

1074
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:05,249
- This is a death match.
- This is your final round.

1075
00:37:05,649 --> 00:37:06,719
Here we go.

1076
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:09,818
Get ready, set...

1077
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:11,219
(They must get it right this time.)

1078
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:14,589
(Eating as quietly as possible)

1079
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:16,558
(Extremely focused)

1080
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:20,299
(Tapping)

1081
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:23,939
(Causing confusion by moving his feet like a lunatic)

1082
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:26,199
(He's in his top condition.)

1083
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:31,508
(We can't get distracted.)

1084
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:33,269
Seon Ho, what are the names of your parents?

1085
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:35,808
My mother is Kim Young Ae. My father is Yoo Ji Hyeon.

1086
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:36,818
(Speaking with ease)

1087
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:38,479
Jong Min, say something to your wife.

1088
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:40,148
I love you.

1089
00:37:40,149 --> 00:37:41,419
This one is the hardest.

1090
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:46,789
Three, two, one.

1091
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:48,829
Jong Min is good at this.

1092
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:50,699
- I can't tell if it's Jong Min.
- Three.

1093
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,199
(Grunting)

1094
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:53,729
One.

1095
00:37:54,429 --> 00:37:55,429
(Screaming)

1096
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:58,599
(While getting tteokbokki sauce smeared on the lips, )

1097
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:00,638
(he holds up the gimbap.)

1098
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,639
(Screaming)

1099
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,509
(He's persistent about creating confusion.)

1100
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:08,849
(I might cry from laughing so hard.)

1101
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:09,918
Goodness.

1102
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:12,479
(Mafia Genius Jong Min appeared at the tteokbokki restaurant.)

1103
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:14,269
I'm sorry. I didn't eat anything.

1104
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:17,659
I would've lost my mind if I were on the other team.

1105
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,358
After the unexpected twist from last time...

1106
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:21,658
(They can't tell if it's real or fake.)

1107
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:23,798
I think it's either Seon Ho or Se Yoon.

1108
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:24,959
Let's go with one of them.

1109
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,229
Shall we go with Se Yoon?

1110
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:28,099
Based on my feelings?

1111
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:30,598
- We'll answer right away.
- My shoe.

1112
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,138
- Okay.
- The sole came off.

1113
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:33,859
(The sole of his slipper couldn't stay on.)

1114
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:35,139
(Guys, please take a look at my slipper.)

1115
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,909
I got a strong feeling about it.

1116
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:38,639
I paid a lot for these shoes.

1117
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,449
(Rest in peace, sole of his slipper)

1118
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:43,848
We'll guess right away.

1119
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:45,448
The one who didn't eat is...

1120
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:46,788
- Se Yoon.
- It's Se Yoon.

1121
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:48,819
(They picked Se Yoon as the food mafia.)

1122
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:50,718
(Team Food Mafia's meal will be over if Team Detectives is right.)

1123
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,819
The answer is...

1124
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:55,229
(What's the result?)

1125
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:56,599
- I am...
- It's me.

1126
00:38:57,029 --> 00:38:58,228
It was Seon Ho.

1127
00:38:58,229 --> 00:38:59,229
It's me.

1128
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,628
(They're wrong again.)

1129
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,238
They're wrong again. We get to eat a lot.

1130
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,239
Jong Min.

1131
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,239
(Team New and Old Love is the final winner.)

1132
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,299
You saved our team.

1133
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:10,008
Jong Min did a wonderful job in this game.

1134
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:11,209
He's really good.

1135
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:12,378
(Really?)

1136
00:39:12,379 --> 00:39:13,379
(Screaming)

1137
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,879
(Encore)

1138
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,818
You're good.

1139
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:19,255
(They watch him again in admiration.)

1140
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:21,188
- Gosh, Kim Jong Min.
- Can we eat?

1141
00:39:21,189 --> 00:39:22,189
(Team New and Old Love starts their meal with ease.)

1142
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,590
- He's good.
- Jong Min is amazing.

1143
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:26,258
(Eating)

1144
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:28,058
In this game, we couldn't do anything...

1145
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:29,228
- because of Jong Min.
- Seriously.

1146
00:39:29,229 --> 00:39:30,528
Jong Min, you're amazing.

1147
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:32,359
It was almost impossible.

1148
00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:34,329
The jjolmyeon is so good and refreshing.

1149
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:39,639
(Seon Ho takes a bite of jjolmyeon after Se Yoon.)

1150
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:41,469
(Tteokbokki)

1151
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:43,339
(Fried dumpling)

1152
00:39:45,909 --> 00:39:49,679
(They finally get to savor the food.)

1153
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,249
It's delicious.

1154
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:53,819
The restaurant's tteokbokki is nice.

1155
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:55,849
- It's not too salty or spicy.
- I agree.

1156
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:57,199
- The taste is addicting.
- Yes.

1157
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:58,659
It's not spicy at all.

1158
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:01,359
Even if I get locked up, I'd eat this for 45 years.

1159
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:03,459
It tastes nice and mild.

1160
00:40:03,729 --> 00:40:04,729
(The three of them can only watch the others eat.)

1161
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,599
- Gosh.
- This is so delicious.

1162
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:08,828
- In that case...
- It'd be nice for them to taste it.

1163
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:09,998
(1 minute of eating, empty stomach, 1 minute of eating)

1164
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:12,698
We prepared some food for the losing team.

1165
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:14,179
- Would you like some?
- Sounds good.

1166
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:15,949
- Please bring it in.
- That sounds good.

1167
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:17,079
Come in.

1168
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:18,878
Please leave.

1169
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,348
(Boiled eggs)

1170
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:21,349
Please leave.

1171
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:23,979
(Protein for the hungry ones)

1172
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,278
Could you...

1173
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:27,348
(A huge disappointment)

1174
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:29,648
- Give us some fishcake broth.
- You can't give us this only.

1175
00:40:29,649 --> 00:40:32,088
- Fishcake broth is served for free.
- It'll be too dry.

1176
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:34,758
How about some fishcake broth and tteokbokki sauce?

1177
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:35,788
Yes.

1178
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:37,498
(We'd be very grateful.)

1179
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:39,229
- Tteokbokki sauce? Okay.
- Yes.

1180
00:40:39,529 --> 00:40:42,099
Crushed eggs mixed in the sauce are enough for me.

1181
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:43,339
They aren't enough for me.

1182
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:45,869
- They're enough for me.
- Okay.

1183
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,969
- Gosh, Jong Min.
- It's delicious.

1184
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:49,608
- It's good.
- You're impressive.

1185
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:50,738
We won thanks to you.

1186
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,478
- Today...
- He's unbelievable today.

1187
00:40:52,479 --> 00:40:55,159
- He's been good since the morning.
- Jong Min is doing everything.

1188
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,719
He turned the tables.

1189
00:40:57,849 --> 00:40:59,179
He's definitely an ace.

1190
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:03,859
(Starting with the quiz on Seoul in the morning)

1191
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:08,759
(An unprecedented fashion show)

1192
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:12,099
(Including his distraction tactics, he excelled throughout the day.)

1193
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:14,699
- This game belongs to Jong Min.
- Right.

1194
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:17,069
He's good at games that require lying.

1195
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:19,629
- Deceiving others.
- Deceiving others.

1196
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,068
- And scamming.
- I'm also good at betraying.

1197
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:22,469
(Betraying is a bonus.)

1198
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:24,708
Here it is. Let's eat now.

1199
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:25,915
(The tteokbokki sauce and fishcake broth arrive.)

1200
00:41:25,939 --> 00:41:28,078
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1201
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,819
- Enjoy your food.
- This is much better.

1202
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:31,989
I ate it right away. I wanted it so much.

1203
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:36,688
- That looks delicious.
- What they're eating looks good.

1204
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:37,759
Can you give me an egg?

1205
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:39,829
This is what you do at the end.

1206
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:41,788
First, you finish tteokbokki and fried food.

1207
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:43,958
When you have this much sauce left,

1208
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,698
you crush the ugly dumpling and the egg.

1209
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:48,928
What's ugly dumpling?

1210
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:50,489
It's the one with glass noodles inside.

1211
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:52,998
- I ate it.
- Is that it? I had one too.

1212
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:54,638
You crush them completely.

1213
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:56,108
Scoop them up with the sauce.

1214
00:41:56,109 --> 00:41:57,478
- Do you crush them completely?
- Yes.

1215
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:59,738
You can eat it like that because it's slightly sweet...

1216
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:01,109
without being spicy or salty.

1217
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:04,078
Then the sauce becomes thick.

1218
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,478
(The tteokbokki sauce became thick with egg yolk and glass noodles.)

1219
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,488
- That's tasty.
- That is...

1220
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:10,118
You scoop it up with a spoon.

1221
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:12,189
(When you scoop it up with a spoon)

1222
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:13,628
(Humming in approval)

1223
00:42:13,629 --> 00:42:15,458
I couldn't wait that long.

1224
00:42:15,459 --> 00:42:16,599
Right.

1225
00:42:17,229 --> 00:42:19,269
(Sae Ho follows what DinDin made and takes a bite.)

1226
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:21,968
- It's delicious.
- Boiled egg...

1227
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:23,598
in tteokbokki sauce is excellent.

1228
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,599
Isn't it?

1229
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,138
Okay. Those punks are having a nice meal.

1230
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:29,439
- It must remind him of the past.
- It looks good.

1231
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:31,538
Does it taste the same as it did when you were a child?

1232
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:32,608
Yes, it's the same.

1233
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:34,008
When it tastes too strong, you get tired of it easily.

1234
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,009
Right.

1235
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,318
- So we ate it every day.
- That would be possible.

1236
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:39,578
When the school ended, we always came here.

1237
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:40,789
I can see that.

1238
00:42:42,049 --> 00:42:45,318
Once they grow up, they'd bring their children and parents.

1239
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:46,858
Three generations would come.

1240
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:49,588
- It's been forty-five years.
- Three generations is possible.

1241
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:53,629
My mom brought me and my sisters here.

1242
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:56,898
My little sister brings Nicole here.

1243
00:42:56,899 --> 00:42:59,259
- So that's three generations.
- That's more than possible.

1244
00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:02,538
(Please come and try this One Night Ribbon restaurant.)

1245
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:05,838
Strangely enough, didn't we start off well?

1246
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,719
Right, but we were lucky only in the beginning.

1247
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:11,819
(They have to move to the next location.)

1248
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:14,148
- What's this?
- Please stand here.

1249
00:43:14,149 --> 00:43:15,888
- We...
- What's this?

1250
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:16,889
- What's this?
- What's this?

1251
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,988
We have to move to the next location.

1252
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:22,228
Since it's rush hour, there will be traffic.

1253
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:24,458
- Right. On a bus...
- This is when we need it.

1254
00:43:24,459 --> 00:43:27,998
- One team will save their energy...
- What?

1255
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:30,099
And take public transportation.

1256
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:32,439
- Save our energy?
- Yes.

1257
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:34,879
It means that the other team will use their energy.

1258
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:37,908
One team will build up their stamina.

1259
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:40,309
- We might ride bicycles.
- I'm not wearing running shoes.

1260
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:42,778
- Are we riding bicycles?
- You'll take Ttareungyi.

1261
00:43:42,779 --> 00:43:44,139
You'll ride bicycles to get there.

1262
00:43:44,279 --> 00:43:46,988
(Public bicycles?)

1263
00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:48,149
You mean, electric bicycles?

1264
00:43:48,249 --> 00:43:50,058
Ttareungyi isn't an electric bicycle.

1265
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:51,088
You have to pedal it.

1266
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:52,265
(It's a classic method where you push off with both feet.)

1267
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:54,158
Is there Ttareungyi for someone who weighs 120kg?

1268
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,658
- Everybody can ride Ttareungyi.
- Even someone weighing 120kg?

1269
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:58,599
- Yes.
- I haven't ridden it as I felt bad.

1270
00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:01,705
I felt guilty when I thought of riding a shared bicycle.

1271
00:44:01,729 --> 00:44:03,638
It depends on where we go.

1272
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:05,598
(The public transportation game)

1273
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,108
- We invited a special guest...
- I hope we win.

1274
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:10,439
- to decide your ride.
- What?

1275
00:44:10,979 --> 00:44:12,778
Sae Ho's friend will help us.

1276
00:44:12,779 --> 00:44:13,878
- My friend?
- Really? I don't see anyone.

1277
00:44:13,879 --> 00:44:15,648
- We invited Sae Ho's friend.
- You mean, Nam Chang Hee?

1278
00:44:15,649 --> 00:44:16,795
- Who is it?
- Please come forward.

1279
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:18,225
- Nam Chang Hee?
- Who could that be?

1280
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:21,888
(Please come forward.)

1281
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:24,618
(Hee Sung is bringing something?)

1282
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:25,619
Why is Hee Sung coming?

1283
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,929
(They saw something.)

1284
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:31,059
Oh, I see.

1285
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:34,969
(The toy dove seems familiar.)

1286
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:38,439
(Sae Ho brought it for the yeopjeon auction.)

1287
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:41,839
(Cho Bird, Sae Ho's pet dove?)

1288
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:43,779
(Oh, so he meant this one.)

1289
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:46,079
(He's glad to see it again.)

1290
00:44:46,279 --> 00:44:48,248
(It appeared after 3 weeks and is trying to make a nice entrance.)

1291
00:44:48,249 --> 00:44:50,219
(But it fell.)

1292
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:52,479
Let's try again. Oh, no. Again.

1293
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:54,069
Try again, slowly this time.

1294
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:55,619
You shouldn't treat it so badly.

1295
00:44:57,419 --> 00:44:58,939
You've never had a pet bird, have you?

1296
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:01,159
He's watching the bird like a worried dad.

1297
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:02,858
He's good with it, just as expected.

1298
00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:05,029
- He's good at playing with it.
- Come on.

1299
00:45:05,299 --> 00:45:08,028
The game you'll play this time is The Dove's Choice.

1300
00:45:08,029 --> 00:45:10,189
(The transportation random game is The Dove's Choice.)

1301
00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:14,609
(The toy dove moves in random directions when released.)

1302
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:17,038
It will be released in this position.

1303
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:18,715
(The dove will be released in the center of the circle.)

1304
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:21,549
The team with the member whom the dove's beak points at...

1305
00:45:22,149 --> 00:45:25,249
will ride a bicycle to go to the next location.

1306
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:29,089
(Which team will be chosen by the dove?)

1307
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:31,718
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1308
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:33,439
Rock-paper-scissors. Okay. I placed second.

1309
00:45:33,629 --> 00:45:34,788
- Let's choose our positions.
- All right.

1310
00:45:34,789 --> 00:45:36,528
So now... Where will the three of you be?

1311
00:45:36,529 --> 00:45:37,658
- Where will you be?
- We'll be here.

1312
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:38,759
What about you?

1313
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:40,598
- I'll be here.
- You placed second.

1314
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:42,075
- No, this spot is...
- I think we'll be safe.

1315
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:43,898
- I placed 3rd.
- Se Yoon placed 3rd.

1316
00:45:43,899 --> 00:45:45,299
Come here. He said I placed third.

1317
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:46,809
I'll be here.

1318
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:48,838
- No. Why would you go there?
- What's wrong?

1319
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:50,008
You think it'll turn in this direction?

1320
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:51,978
It'll start moving, facing that side. That's nonsense.

1321
00:45:51,979 --> 00:45:53,138
Have you all chosen your spots?

1322
00:45:53,139 --> 00:45:55,478
- Have we all made our choices?
- Now that we've made our choices...

1323
00:45:55,479 --> 00:45:57,118
We're divided exactly in half.

1324
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,119
(Each team gathered on each side.)

1325
00:45:59,249 --> 00:46:01,218
We've won all the games to decide the transportation so far.

1326
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:03,148
- He's going to release it.
- We've won all of such games.

1327
00:46:03,149 --> 00:46:05,819
- Let's go!
- Wind it many times.

1328
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:08,329
- I trust you.
- Ready.

1329
00:46:09,129 --> 00:46:10,159
- Go!
- Move.

1330
00:46:10,359 --> 00:46:12,298
- Move. Keep going.
- That's good.

1331
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:13,469
- Turn.
- Turn around.

1332
00:46:13,629 --> 00:46:16,129
(The dove starts walking cheerfully.)

1333
00:46:16,529 --> 00:46:17,668
- Move. Go.
- That's good.

1334
00:46:17,669 --> 00:46:19,199
(Its former owner frightens it out?)

1335
00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:21,538
Go away! Turn around!

1336
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:24,279
- That's good. Keep going.
- Turn around!

1337
00:46:24,439 --> 00:46:25,538
(Please)

1338
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:27,109
- Turn around!
- Turn around!

1339
00:46:27,209 --> 00:46:32,419
(The fate of 3 members depends on the dove's choice.)

1340
00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:35,888
(Whom will the dove choose?)

1341
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:37,818
- Turn around!
- Turn around! Please turn.

1342
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:40,659
(DinDin is smiling?)

1343
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:42,189
(Laughing)

1344
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:46,299
(The dove started moving while facing the front.)

1345
00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:49,369
(It turned right suddenly.)

1346
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:50,898
- Turn around!
- Turn.

1347
00:46:50,899 --> 00:46:53,298
(It's you.)

1348
00:46:53,299 --> 00:46:56,209
(Cho Bird spotted the biggest prey.)

1349
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:59,579
(Frightened)

1350
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:02,648
Turn around!

1351
00:47:02,649 --> 00:47:04,749
(It stops.)

1352
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:07,919
Turn around!

1353
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:09,748
Okay!

1354
00:47:09,749 --> 00:47:11,359
(Joyful, bitter)

1355
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:14,129
(We're done for.)

1356
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:18,999
Se Yoon. I mean...

1357
00:47:19,299 --> 00:47:20,898
- I'm glad you didn't go there.
- Why did you go there...

1358
00:47:20,899 --> 00:47:22,145
- when Joon was here?
- Exactly.

1359
00:47:22,169 --> 00:47:23,529
- Had he gone there...
- Oh, gosh.

1360
00:47:23,899 --> 00:47:24,899
Why did I come here?

1361
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,345
Why did you choose that spot? Joon was here!

1362
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:28,208
Joon was standing here before he switched spots.

1363
00:47:28,209 --> 00:47:30,355
- Se Yoon asked me to switch spots.
- He asked Joon to switch spots.

1364
00:47:30,379 --> 00:47:33,609
(It's true that Se Yoon wanted to switch spots.)

1365
00:47:33,649 --> 00:47:35,125
- Oh, that's right.
- We were all on this side.

1366
00:47:35,149 --> 00:47:37,478
- Why did you say I could switch?
- Why did he... Gosh, I'm dizzy.

1367
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,879
I told you not to go there.

1368
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:42,619
(Let's get going now.)

1369
00:47:43,189 --> 00:47:44,488
The team to ride a bicycle...

1370
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:46,418
- will pass the Hannam Bridge, - Oh, okay.

1371
00:47:46,419 --> 00:47:48,028
Cross the Banpo Bridge,

1372
00:47:48,029 --> 00:47:50,359
- The Jamsu Bridge?
- and go to the Apgujeong Wharf.

1373
00:47:50,399 --> 00:47:51,428
What? Hold on.

1374
00:47:51,429 --> 00:47:54,198
The Hannam Bridge is over there. They're crossing the Banpo Bridge?

1375
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:55,298
- That's correct.
- Oh, gosh.

1376
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:56,568
- Is there a time limit?
- It's quite far.

1377
00:47:56,569 --> 00:47:58,475
- So we'll take a detour?
- Will it be 5km to 6km?

1378
00:47:58,499 --> 00:47:59,739
No way. That's not long enough.

1379
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:02,239
I need cycling cleats to ride a bicycle.

1380
00:48:03,169 --> 00:48:04,208
- What?
- Let's get going.

1381
00:48:04,209 --> 00:48:05,409
(What did you say you needed?)

1382
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:09,178
(They will move to the next location.)

1383
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:11,949
- Get on the bicycle. Let's go.
- It's okay.

1384
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:14,649
Thanks to 2 Days 1 Night, I get to try a lot of new things.

1385
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:17,888
(Wobbling)

1386
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:19,218
The saddle might break off.

1387
00:48:19,219 --> 00:48:20,789
(Anxious)

1388
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:23,458
I might be sued for bicycle abuse.

1389
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:25,305
(Worried Fatty is worried even before riding it.)

1390
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:27,169
We'll get there shortly. Can I go really fast?

1391
00:48:27,499 --> 00:48:29,368
Can I go at my own pace?

1392
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:30,699
All right, guys. Let's get going.

1393
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:32,868
(Finally, Team Bicycle sets off.)

1394
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:33,909
Let's go!

1395
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:36,809
I'll lead the group. Let's go!

1396
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:38,209
(Se Yoon and Seon Ho are following Jong Min.)

1397
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,010
If you stop, the entire group will fall down.

1398
00:48:42,149 --> 00:48:43,349
It's drizzling.

1399
00:48:44,649 --> 00:48:45,649
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

1400
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:46,749
I like this. It's romantic.

1401
00:48:47,389 --> 00:48:48,389
(Shouting excitedly)

1402
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:50,819
- This is nice.
- Riding at the Han River is fun.

1403
00:48:51,889 --> 00:48:53,728
You can enjoy the scenery while riding a bicycle.

1404
00:48:53,729 --> 00:48:55,389
The air is fresh here, you know.

1405
00:48:57,029 --> 00:49:02,768
(The bicycle route around the Han River)

1406
00:49:02,769 --> 00:49:03,938
You're right. We should enjoy the scenery.

1407
00:49:03,939 --> 00:49:05,298
It smells good around the Han River.

1408
00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:06,638
Right. It smells good around the Han River.

1409
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,545
- Yes, it smells good.
- The scent of phytoncide.

1410
00:49:08,569 --> 00:49:10,639
- Since it's raining...
- That's right.

1411
00:49:11,479 --> 00:49:12,479
The smell of rain.

1412
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,178
I can smell the asphalt. It's nice.

1413
00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:16,219
It's cool and refreshing. You can enjoy the breeze.

1414
00:49:17,379 --> 00:49:19,718
(The three of them are going forward while enjoying the cool breeze.)

1415
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:22,119
It's nice. We've already moved 500m.

1416
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:24,870
- We'll be there shortly.
- Right. It won't take so long.

1417
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:28,029
Also, we've had so much sugar.

1418
00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:29,858
- Right. We had a lot of sweet food.
- Yes, we did.

1419
00:49:29,859 --> 00:49:31,498
So we need to exercise to remove it from the body.

1420
00:49:31,499 --> 00:49:33,428
- Let's melt it away.
- Right. We should melt it away.

1421
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:34,429
Let's melt it away.

1422
00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:36,768
- You're keeping up with me, right?
- Of course.

1423
00:49:36,769 --> 00:49:38,575
(While the three of them are riding the bicycle with all their might...)

1424
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:40,119
This means we won't have time to rest.

1425
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:41,669
That's right.

1426
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:44,009
(I'll arrive before them and rest.)

1427
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:45,308
(Se Yoon speeds up.)

1428
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:46,309
Hey, Se Yoon.

1429
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,209
(Se Yoon passes Jong Min.)

1430
00:49:50,179 --> 00:49:51,948
- Look at him.
- He'll get exhausted shortly.

1431
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:53,019
He'll get exhausted.

1432
00:49:53,249 --> 00:49:55,049
He's overdoing it.

1433
00:49:56,089 --> 00:49:58,169
I can't ride with the old man. It's too frustrating.

1434
00:49:58,389 --> 00:50:01,829
You'll see why I'm controlling my pace.

1435
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:05,399
(It's not important to control my pace.)

1436
00:50:06,799 --> 00:50:08,929
We're 1.9km away from the Banpo Bridge.

1437
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:12,139
He's already...

1438
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:14,139
He's already breathing heavily.

1439
00:50:15,339 --> 00:50:17,939
(Jong Min catches up with him not long after.)

1440
00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:19,708
(I knew it.)

1441
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:22,309
(Jong Min turns the table around in only 2 minutes.)

1442
00:50:22,649 --> 00:50:23,818
(Jong Min, Se Yoon)

1443
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:24,979
Hey, why aren't you coming?

1444
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:27,019
Speed up, Se Yoon.

1445
00:50:27,419 --> 00:50:28,618
- Se Yoon.
- Yes?

1446
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:32,389
- I told you to control your pace.
- Don't speak to me.

1447
00:50:33,259 --> 00:50:36,328
- How far are we from there?
- We've moved about 2.3km.

1448
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:37,429
(They have moved 2.3km.)

1449
00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:40,199
We'll turn left and cross the Jamsu Bridge.

1450
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:41,869
Okay.

1451
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:44,069
Se Yoon, hurry up.

1452
00:50:44,439 --> 00:50:46,469
We're almost there. I see the Jamsu Bridge.

1453
00:50:49,169 --> 00:50:52,609
(They will cross the Jamsu Bridge to get to their destination.)

1454
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:54,679
Okay.

1455
00:50:55,979 --> 00:50:57,949
It's an uphill road. Darn it.

1456
00:50:58,349 --> 00:50:59,648
(The uphill section appears in front of Se Yoon.)

1457
00:50:59,649 --> 00:51:01,169
That's crazy. Look at the uphill road.

1458
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:02,549
It will be exhausting.

1459
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:06,419
(The exhausting uphill road begins.)

1460
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:08,259
This uphill road is no joke.

1461
00:51:08,389 --> 00:51:09,489
Darn.

1462
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:12,228
- Speed up.
- I don't think I can do that.

1463
00:51:12,229 --> 00:51:13,298
You can do it. Don't get tired.

1464
00:51:13,299 --> 00:51:15,299
(He's already tired.)

1465
00:51:15,669 --> 00:51:17,145
Don't get tired. The road will go downhill shortly.

1466
00:51:17,169 --> 00:51:19,375
- I'm on the verge of giving up.
- Just a little longer.

1467
00:51:19,399 --> 00:51:21,085
Jong Min, I'm not sure if the tires can hold out.

1468
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:22,268
- What?
- My legs...

1469
00:51:22,269 --> 00:51:24,029
The tires are so thin that they're wobbling.

1470
00:51:24,739 --> 00:51:26,378
- Keep moving just a little longer.
- I'm so tired.

1471
00:51:26,379 --> 00:51:27,808
- We're almost there.
- I'm on the verge of stopping.

1472
00:51:27,809 --> 00:51:30,169
- The road will go downhill.
- My bicycle is about to stop.

1473
00:51:31,179 --> 00:51:33,248
Right. The bicycle...

1474
00:51:33,249 --> 00:51:34,425
(The bicycle wobbles as Se Yoon does.)

1475
00:51:34,449 --> 00:51:38,219
(I don't think I can keep going.)

1476
00:51:38,389 --> 00:51:41,559
You just have to get through this.

1477
00:51:43,759 --> 00:51:44,759
I'm hopeless.

1478
00:51:44,999 --> 00:51:46,405
Don't get tired. The road will go downhill shortly.

1479
00:51:46,429 --> 00:51:48,228
- I'm on the verge of giving up.
- Just a little bit farther.

1480
00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:50,005
- But I'm about to give up.
- Just a little bit farther.

1481
00:51:50,029 --> 00:51:51,915
- The bicycle is about to stop.
- We're almost there.

1482
00:51:51,939 --> 00:51:53,838
- The road will go downhill.
- My bicycle is about to stop.

1483
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,569
You just have to get through this.

1484
00:51:55,769 --> 00:51:57,455
- Okay.
- You just have to get through this.

1485
00:51:57,479 --> 00:51:58,878
If you get through this, the road will go downhill.

1486
00:51:58,879 --> 00:52:00,549
I might give up before my bicycle stops.

1487
00:52:01,509 --> 00:52:02,509
Hey.

1488
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:04,318
Now...

1489
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,878
(And finally...)

1490
00:52:05,879 --> 00:52:07,848
It will become a lot easier now.

1491
00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:10,195
If we just get through this, it'll be a lot easier after that.

1492
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:11,318
Right.

1493
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:12,488
(He finally reaches the top of the uphill section.)

1494
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:13,589
Right.

1495
00:52:13,689 --> 00:52:14,769
Right. Gosh, I'm exhausted.

1496
00:52:16,689 --> 00:52:17,858
I made it.

1497
00:52:17,859 --> 00:52:20,529
(Se Yoon did a great job, and his bicycle held out very well.)

1498
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:21,968
Good job. How does it feel?

1499
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:22,969
You feel accomplished, right?

1500
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,298
- I made it.
- Oh, my. Go for it!

1501
00:52:25,299 --> 00:52:26,299
Hello.

1502
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:30,039
(Looking around)

1503
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:32,609
We should wait for Seon Ho. He's far behind us.

1504
00:52:32,739 --> 00:52:34,678
- Really? He is?
- Yes. We can't hear him.

1505
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:35,709
Let's slow down.

1506
00:52:36,379 --> 00:52:38,299
What's wrong with him? He's on the younger side.

1507
00:52:38,419 --> 00:52:39,419
I know, right?

1508
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,189
Yesterday,

1509
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,139
I filmed a running scene of a movie...

1510
00:52:46,489 --> 00:52:49,328
for about three and a half hours.

1511
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:50,329
(Making an excuse)

1512
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,399
Seon Ho.

1513
00:52:52,759 --> 00:52:53,759
(After twists and turns, Seon Ho joins them.)

1514
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,399
You can do it. You've got this!

1515
00:52:57,499 --> 00:52:59,598
Right now, we're... What?

1516
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,668
(Departure, arrival)

1517
00:53:00,669 --> 00:53:02,039
- Sorry?
- We've moved 5km.

1518
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:03,668
- Did you say 5km?
- We've moved 5km...

1519
00:53:03,669 --> 00:53:05,339
on a bicycle.

1520
00:53:06,609 --> 00:53:07,808
Gosh. This is so exhausting.

1521
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:08,809
(All of them try to keep it up just for a little longer.)

1522
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,079
Goodness. I'm so exhausted.

1523
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:14,288
I wish I was still wearing those shorts.

1524
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:15,419
The shorts I wore earlier.

1525
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:17,335
- They were cycling shorts.
- Oh, right.

1526
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:18,459
You picked the right pants.

1527
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:21,489
(Riding the bicycle rhythmically)

1528
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:25,899
(Jong Min comes in 1st!)

1529
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:27,828
- Did you arrive?
- Yes.

1530
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,398
- I asked if you arrived.
- Yes, I did.

1531
00:53:29,399 --> 00:53:30,569
I'm exhausted.

1532
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:32,799
Impressive. Se Yoon did a good job keeping up with me.

1533
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:34,379
Se Yoon really did a great job.

1534
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:36,438
(Se Yoon arrives.)

1535
00:53:36,439 --> 00:53:37,478
My legs are wobbly.

1536
00:53:37,479 --> 00:53:38,509
Be careful.

1537
00:53:39,279 --> 00:53:40,779
Hey, you did a great job.

1538
00:53:40,879 --> 00:53:42,048
He surprised me.

1539
00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:43,079
(Great job, Se Yoon.)

1540
00:53:43,279 --> 00:53:44,319
My legs look great now.

1541
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:45,718
The muscles in my legs are pumped up so much.

1542
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:47,695
(By riding a bicycle, he pumped up his leg muscles.)

1543
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:49,619
Oh, gosh. My sacrum hurts.

1544
00:53:50,089 --> 00:53:52,189
What's wrong with Seon Ho? He's still young.

1545
00:53:52,659 --> 00:53:53,659
Why couldn't he keep up with us?

1546
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,088
Seon Ho started falling behind far earlier.

1547
00:53:55,089 --> 00:53:56,288
(A few minutes later)

1548
00:53:56,289 --> 00:53:57,299
He just got here.

1549
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:59,058
(Seon Ho has arrived too.)

1550
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:01,168
Seon Ho, this way. Are you okay?

1551
00:54:01,169 --> 00:54:02,868
(Seon Ho can't even talk properly.)

1552
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:03,869
I'm not okay.

1553
00:54:04,669 --> 00:54:06,869
- What's wrong with you?
- You aren't fit at all.

1554
00:54:06,999 --> 00:54:08,038
Yesterday...

1555
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:09,768
- Come on.
- Yesterday? Don't even start.

1556
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:11,049
Everybody worked hard yesterday.

1557
00:54:11,609 --> 00:54:13,985
I ran for three hours and a half while filming a movie yesterday.

1558
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:15,348
(The sun has set by the Han River.)

1559
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:16,978
Let's go for the next quests.

1560
00:54:16,979 --> 00:54:18,139
- We have more quests?
- Yes.

1561
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,148
- Seon Ho was exhausted.
- He couldn't catch up with us.

1562
00:54:20,149 --> 00:54:21,988
- He passed out.
- His eyes are rolling.

1563
00:54:21,989 --> 00:54:23,819
- Look at him.
- I'm feeling dizzy now.

1564
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:27,058
I can't believe a pigeon can bring this much of trouble.

1565
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:28,299
(A big stir caused by a pigeon)

1566
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:30,998
We'll close the curtains now.

1567
00:54:30,999 --> 00:54:32,198
- What?
- Really?

1568
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:33,599
You're making me scared.

1569
00:54:34,029 --> 00:54:35,098
This is scary.

1570
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:36,099
It's going to be fun.

1571
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,599
One Night Ribbon Trip. We are heading to...

1572
00:54:39,439 --> 00:54:40,709
a place known for a date.

1573
00:54:41,169 --> 00:54:42,509
- Namsan?
- The Han River Park.

1574
00:54:43,439 --> 00:54:44,785
- The Han River?
- If we're going there...

1575
00:54:44,809 --> 00:54:46,679
We're shooting everything by the Han River.

1576
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,848
We are going to see "The Host" soon.

1577
00:54:48,849 --> 00:54:50,078
Why are we still by the Han River?

1578
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,878
Before Jong Min married his wife,

1579
00:54:53,879 --> 00:54:55,988
- they had many dates at the park.
- We used to go to the park a lot.

1580
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:57,658
Didn't you say you were only in your car by the Han River?

1581
00:54:57,659 --> 00:54:58,659
No, not at all.

1582
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,918
We got out of our car...

1583
00:54:59,919 --> 00:55:01,188
- and took a walk together.
- By the Han River?

1584
00:55:01,189 --> 00:55:03,205
We had instant noodles at the convenience store too.

1585
00:55:03,229 --> 00:55:05,129
- Goodness, really?
- Of course.

1586
00:55:05,529 --> 00:55:07,768
- You took her out here a lot?
- Right.

1587
00:55:07,769 --> 00:55:10,369
(Jong Min used to enjoy his date by the Han River.)

1588
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:13,398
(The landmark of the night view of the Han River)

1589
00:55:13,399 --> 00:55:16,439
(Banpo Hangang Park)

1590
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:19,038
The civilians of Seoul are enjoying the night in Seoul.

1591
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,279
You are going to do the mission with them.

1592
00:55:21,709 --> 00:55:23,248
It's called Avatar 2 Days 1 Night.

1593
00:55:23,249 --> 00:55:25,449
- Avatar?
- Like the Avatar Blind Date?

1594
00:55:25,749 --> 00:55:28,318
You will designate one person for each team.

1595
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,058
Your opponent team will appoint one person for your team.

1596
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:34,828
He has to be the avatar to complete the mission...

1597
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:35,889
of the other team.

1598
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:38,599
He's eliminated if his name gets called out more than two times.

1599
00:55:38,759 --> 00:55:40,129
The mission will be over.

1600
00:55:40,229 --> 00:55:42,529
The team that lasts longer wins.

1601
00:55:42,729 --> 00:55:45,698
- Selecting the avatar is important.
- Right.

1602
00:55:45,699 --> 00:55:48,369
Let's decide on the avatar for the other team.

1603
00:55:49,009 --> 00:55:50,608
Jong Min is in his element today.

1604
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:53,608
- No.
- Jong Min should be the avatar.

1605
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:55,008
I can take a good guess.

1606
00:55:55,009 --> 00:55:57,178
Let's appoint Jong Min and do this.

1607
00:55:57,179 --> 00:55:59,148
"Jong Min, while you run,"

1608
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:00,278
"act like you got struck by lightning."

1609
00:56:00,279 --> 00:56:02,089
(Sizzling)

1610
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:04,658
- That sounds fun.
- Yes, that's a good one.

1611
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:06,695
- That sounds fun.
- I want Jong Min to be the avatar.

1612
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,189
- Really?
- Let's hear them out too.

1613
00:56:10,289 --> 00:56:12,398
The avatar will meet the civilians.

1614
00:56:12,399 --> 00:56:14,428
Sae Ho has a lot of experience.

1615
00:56:14,429 --> 00:56:17,129
- We'll appoint Jong Min then.
- Okay, then. It's Jong Min.

1616
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:19,399
- Then...
- No, Sae Ho...

1617
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:20,908
- Tell us what you think.
- You're still not persuaded?

1618
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:23,338
It has to be someone familiar.

1619
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,739
Someone people can recognize easily. Let's go with Jong Min.

1620
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:27,338
(Jong Min will be the avatar.)

1621
00:56:27,339 --> 00:56:28,379
It's all set then.

1622
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:32,149
(He has to complete the mission without his name being called out.)

1623
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,188
(If his name gets called twice, the mission will be over right away.)

1624
00:56:34,189 --> 00:56:35,319
It's raining, right?

1625
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:37,089
It's raining a lot.

1626
00:56:37,459 --> 00:56:39,618
He has to use his umbrella then.

1627
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:40,619
(Who will last longer between these two?)

1628
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,858
- Then...
- Let's go!

1629
00:56:41,859 --> 00:56:42,859
All right.

1630
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,580
We need to make him do something ingenious.

1631
00:56:44,629 --> 00:56:46,298
What should we make him do?

1632
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:48,128
Give me some fun ideas, DinDin.

1633
00:56:48,129 --> 00:56:49,828
How can I give you fun ideas? He's on our team.

1634
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:52,149
- You can tell me secretly.
- This isn't going to be easy.

1635
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,739
(The screen at the Control Room is on.)

1636
00:56:57,169 --> 00:56:59,608
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, I can.

1637
00:56:59,609 --> 00:57:00,708
Okay.

1638
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:01,778
(The avatar is connected.)

1639
00:57:01,779 --> 00:57:03,579
What's it like over there? Do you see anyone?

1640
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:06,818
There aren't as many people as I thought.

1641
00:57:06,819 --> 00:57:07,819
(It's not so crowded at the park because it's raining.)

1642
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,819
The game starts now. You can announce it.

1643
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:11,718
I can hear you. I'll start.

1644
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:12,888
- Really?
- Let's start.

1645
00:57:12,889 --> 00:57:14,729
(Team New and Old Love's mission has started.)

1646
00:57:15,029 --> 00:57:16,228
He'll only do something when you tell him what to do.

1647
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:17,829
- Let's go.
- We'll start.

1648
00:57:19,059 --> 00:57:20,458
(Moving toward the crowd)

1649
00:57:20,459 --> 00:57:21,799
Where is he going?

1650
00:57:22,999 --> 00:57:25,698
(Looking around)

1651
00:57:25,699 --> 00:57:27,845
- There aren't many people.
- I see someone walking toward him.

1652
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:30,438
Sing "Where Are You Now" right now.

1653
00:57:30,439 --> 00:57:32,939
Hello.

1654
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,009
(Will his name get called out as soon as he starts the mission?)

1655
00:57:37,302 --> 00:57:39,201
Sing "Where Are You Now" right now.

1656
00:57:39,202 --> 00:57:42,042
Hello.

1657
00:57:43,242 --> 00:57:46,112
(Will his name get called out as soon as he starts the mission?)

1658
00:57:46,342 --> 00:57:48,781
- May I sing for you?
- Sure.

1659
00:57:48,782 --> 00:57:50,521
(Where are you now?)

1660
00:57:50,522 --> 00:57:51,681
(Laughing)

1661
00:57:51,682 --> 00:57:53,451
(Flustered)

1662
00:57:53,452 --> 00:57:55,352
Give him your microphone and ask him to sing.

1663
00:57:57,462 --> 00:57:59,321
I don't know.

1664
00:57:59,322 --> 00:58:00,538
"How can you go when you don't know?"

1665
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:02,062
How can you go when you don't know?

1666
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:04,032
(Laughing)

1667
00:58:04,202 --> 00:58:05,202
(Joon feels more embarrassed than Sae Ho.)

1668
00:58:05,202 --> 00:58:06,202
Where are you headed to?

1669
00:58:06,203 --> 00:58:08,001
- Are you two a couple?
- Yes, we are.

1670
00:58:08,002 --> 00:58:10,072
That's why I sang for you two.

1671
00:58:10,272 --> 00:58:11,712
Act like you suddenly got possessed.

1672
00:58:12,442 --> 00:58:13,541
Act like you're possessed.

1673
00:58:13,542 --> 00:58:14,712
(Making noises)

1674
00:58:15,212 --> 00:58:17,111
You are suddenly becoming Choi Hong Man.

1675
00:58:17,112 --> 00:58:18,612
(They're having fun teasing him.)

1676
00:58:18,812 --> 00:58:20,111
All right...

1677
00:58:20,112 --> 00:58:22,111
(He easily pulls it off.)

1678
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:24,521
- He's good.
- I could never do that.

1679
00:58:24,522 --> 00:58:25,522
I know.

1680
00:58:25,523 --> 00:58:26,722
They're not calling his name.

1681
00:58:26,952 --> 00:58:29,322
I'll take a photo with them first.

1682
00:58:29,552 --> 00:58:31,462
One, two, three.

1683
00:58:31,922 --> 00:58:33,591
- Talk to them.
- Right.

1684
00:58:33,592 --> 00:58:36,761
"If you carry an umbrella on a rainy night like this,"

1685
00:58:36,762 --> 00:58:38,901
- Right.
- "you might get struck..."

1686
00:58:38,902 --> 00:58:40,401
- "by lightning." Act like you did.
- Okay.

1687
00:58:40,402 --> 00:58:42,102
- Hello.
- You're struck by lightning.

1688
00:58:42,202 --> 00:58:45,241
All right. Where are you headed?

1689
00:58:45,242 --> 00:58:47,118
(They did recognize him. But they are just surprised.)

1690
00:58:47,142 --> 00:58:48,572
Hello. One, two, three.

1691
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:51,342
You should be careful. On a rainy night like this,

1692
00:58:51,512 --> 00:58:54,981
you might get hit by lightning while carrying an umbrella.

1693
00:58:54,982 --> 00:58:55,982
(Screaming)

1694
00:58:56,682 --> 00:58:58,551
(Method-acting)

1695
00:58:58,552 --> 00:59:00,592
Do the method-acting and lie down.

1696
00:59:00,692 --> 00:59:02,852
- "Help me."
- Help me.

1697
00:59:03,252 --> 00:59:05,121
- He sounds like Hong Man.
- Help me.

1698
00:59:05,122 --> 00:59:07,231
Ask them to help you get up.

1699
00:59:07,232 --> 00:59:08,261
Help me.

1700
00:59:08,262 --> 00:59:10,832
- Do it in Hong Man's voice.
- Impersonate Hong Man.

1701
00:59:12,332 --> 00:59:13,801
- Change your voice.
- Hello.

1702
00:59:13,802 --> 00:59:15,408
- I'm Choi Hong Man.
- Say, "What happened to my voice?"

1703
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:16,602
What happened to my voice?

1704
00:59:16,632 --> 00:59:18,171
"Why is my voice like Hong Man's?"

1705
00:59:18,172 --> 00:59:19,841
Why is my voice like Hong Man's?

1706
00:59:19,842 --> 00:59:22,041
- Is this 2 Days 1 Night?
- Yes.

1707
00:59:22,042 --> 00:59:23,611
(Really?)

1708
00:59:23,612 --> 00:59:25,942
- Can you wrestle with them?
- I feel bad for him.

1709
00:59:26,482 --> 00:59:28,312
- No!
- Wrestle with them now.

1710
00:59:30,212 --> 00:59:32,082
(Reality hitting him hard)

1711
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:34,791
- Can you wrestle with me?
- What?

1712
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:35,922
Show us the Techno Goliath.

1713
00:59:38,162 --> 00:59:39,362
(Laughing)

1714
00:59:40,192 --> 00:59:42,092
(Oh, my gosh.)

1715
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:43,722
They're not calling his name.

1716
00:59:44,262 --> 00:59:46,201
- I'm so sorry.
- Did you fail this mission?

1717
00:59:46,202 --> 00:59:49,032
No, I made it. Thank you.

1718
00:59:49,602 --> 00:59:51,542
- Thank you so much. I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

1719
00:59:51,702 --> 00:59:53,078
His name hasn't been called, right?

1720
00:59:53,102 --> 00:59:54,111
Not yet.

1721
00:59:54,112 --> 00:59:55,342
(His name hasn't been called.)

1722
00:59:56,412 --> 00:59:57,412
Hello.

1723
00:59:57,413 --> 00:59:58,982
(Sae Ho greeting the civilians first)

1724
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,312
Hello. Where are you headed?

1725
01:00:01,012 --> 01:00:03,921
My daughter is a big fan of you.

1726
01:00:03,922 --> 01:00:05,151
Do you want to take a picture together?

1727
01:00:05,152 --> 01:00:06,181
(Surprised)

1728
01:00:06,182 --> 01:00:09,292
"Which part of me do you like?"

1729
01:00:09,492 --> 01:00:12,192
Which part of me do you like?

1730
01:00:12,422 --> 01:00:15,691
You are so fun on the show, "You Quiz on the Block."

1731
01:00:15,692 --> 01:00:16,762
Thank you.

1732
01:00:17,092 --> 01:00:20,001
After taking photos, say, "Go."

1733
01:00:20,002 --> 01:00:21,772
Then sing this song right away.

1734
01:00:21,902 --> 01:00:23,232
You are good-looking.

1735
01:00:23,702 --> 01:00:26,101
- Where are you headed now?
- We're going home.

1736
01:00:26,102 --> 01:00:27,372
- Go!
- Goodness.

1737
01:00:27,712 --> 01:00:29,442
(Laughing)

1738
01:00:30,012 --> 01:00:32,342
(The avatar feeling no shame)

1739
01:00:32,682 --> 01:00:33,842
- Thank you.
- Goodness.

1740
01:00:34,052 --> 01:00:36,412
(Is he really doing it?)

1741
01:00:38,122 --> 01:00:39,522
- He's good.
- Thank you.

1742
01:00:39,882 --> 01:00:42,051
- Thank you...
- "Be careful not to get struck..."

1743
01:00:42,052 --> 01:00:43,451
It's raining. The lightning...

1744
01:00:43,452 --> 01:00:44,961
(Acting like he's struck by lightning)

1745
01:00:44,962 --> 01:00:47,292
Act like a zombie now.

1746
01:00:47,732 --> 01:00:49,262
Just walk around now.

1747
01:00:49,992 --> 01:00:51,032
Walk around them.

1748
01:00:51,402 --> 01:00:53,201
- Walk.
- He's so good at this.

1749
01:00:53,202 --> 01:00:55,231
- How is he so good at this?
- He's good!

1750
01:00:55,232 --> 01:00:57,112
(A performance that can only be done by Sae Ho)

1751
01:00:57,342 --> 01:00:59,301
- Keep walking.
- I'm sorry.

1752
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:00,302
(Luckily, the mother and the girl like Sae Ho's performance.)

1753
01:01:00,303 --> 01:01:01,411
Someone told me to do it.

1754
01:01:01,412 --> 01:01:02,911
He's so good. My gosh.

1755
01:01:02,912 --> 01:01:05,281
Thank you so much for this. Keep rooting for our show.

1756
01:01:05,282 --> 01:01:06,641
- Sure.
- Please watch our show too.

1757
01:01:06,642 --> 01:01:08,081
- Sure.
- Say, "2 Days..."

1758
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:09,651
All right, 2 Days...

1759
01:01:09,652 --> 01:01:10,781
- 1 Night.
- 1 Night.

1760
01:01:10,782 --> 01:01:11,782
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1761
01:01:11,783 --> 01:01:13,581
Nobody has said, "Go, Sae Ho!" so far.

1762
01:01:13,582 --> 01:01:14,922
- I know.
- Come on.

1763
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:17,462
Scream, "I don't have a name!"

1764
01:01:18,162 --> 01:01:19,391
I don't have a name.

1765
01:01:19,392 --> 01:01:20,931
I don't have a name!

1766
01:01:20,932 --> 01:01:22,462
"Why am I not famous?"

1767
01:01:22,832 --> 01:01:24,401
I can't shout here.

1768
01:01:24,402 --> 01:01:26,402
(Denying the order)

1769
01:01:27,002 --> 01:01:29,372
(His name still hasn't been called.)

1770
01:01:29,672 --> 01:01:32,472
(The time will be up if he can hang on for another 3 minutes.)

1771
01:01:33,502 --> 01:01:35,872
(Three people are walking toward Sae Ho.)

1772
01:01:36,872 --> 01:01:39,012
- Hello.
- Aren't you Sae Ho?

1773
01:01:39,312 --> 01:01:40,881
Aren't you Sae Ho?

1774
01:01:40,882 --> 01:01:42,722
(His name has been called for the first time.)

1775
01:01:42,752 --> 01:01:43,752
(Team Lim Joon Ho is at risk if his name gets called again.)

1776
01:01:43,753 --> 01:01:45,452
It's all right. Were you at the event?

1777
01:01:45,682 --> 01:01:46,881
- No.
- No?

1778
01:01:46,882 --> 01:01:48,028
- I guess not.
- "Are you Ye Seul?"

1779
01:01:48,052 --> 01:01:49,521
- Nice to meet you.
- "Are you Ye Seul?"

1780
01:01:49,522 --> 01:01:52,292
- Aren't you Ye Seul?
- "It has been a long time."

1781
01:01:52,422 --> 01:01:53,792
It has been a long time, Ye Seul.

1782
01:01:54,192 --> 01:01:55,431
It has been a while, yes.

1783
01:01:55,432 --> 01:01:56,532
Aren't you Ye Seul?

1784
01:01:56,562 --> 01:01:59,402
Sing "It's Art" by PSY.

1785
01:01:59,762 --> 01:02:02,531
(Carrying on with the order although it sounds absurd)

1786
01:02:02,532 --> 01:02:04,141
(Laughing)

1787
01:02:04,142 --> 01:02:05,942
Hello, I'm Choi Hong Man..

1788
01:02:07,772 --> 01:02:10,311
Can't Se Yoon do this instead of me?

1789
01:02:10,312 --> 01:02:11,312
No, I'm bad at this.

1790
01:02:11,313 --> 01:02:13,641
- You have to be shameless for this.
- I know. He's so shameless.

1791
01:02:13,642 --> 01:02:15,511
Can I put an umbrella over your head?

1792
01:02:15,512 --> 01:02:16,712
- Okay.
- All right.

1793
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:21,252
It was nice to meet you. Thank you.

1794
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:24,362
Call Sae Ho back. He lasted for ten minutes.

1795
01:02:24,822 --> 01:02:26,591
- I'm horrible at this.
- In fact, Sae Ho...

1796
01:02:26,592 --> 01:02:30,591
is one of the most shameless celebrities.

1797
01:02:30,592 --> 01:02:32,331
- Right. He's really shameless.
- Good job. Come back now.

1798
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:35,031
- He's not embarrassed at all.
- Not at all.

1799
01:02:35,032 --> 01:02:36,131
He's so confident.

1800
01:02:36,132 --> 01:02:37,132
(Everybody can't wait for Jong Min's turn.)

1801
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:38,642
It will be competitive.

1802
01:02:38,702 --> 01:02:39,702
- Hey!
- Sae Ho.

1803
01:02:39,872 --> 01:02:41,441
- Well done.
- Good job.

1804
01:02:41,442 --> 01:02:42,641
(Welcoming Sae Ho)

1805
01:02:42,642 --> 01:02:45,381
- You did an amazing job.
- You did so well.

1806
01:02:45,382 --> 01:02:47,241
- Sit down for a second.
- No one can do this better.

1807
01:02:47,242 --> 01:02:48,652
- Really?
- I think we will win.

1808
01:02:49,652 --> 01:02:50,751
(Kim Jong Min of Team New and Old Love)

1809
01:02:50,752 --> 01:02:52,452
Move to the mission spot.

1810
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:54,252
- All right.
- He's moving now.

1811
01:02:55,122 --> 01:02:58,492
Could you walk while dancing?

1812
01:03:00,122 --> 01:03:01,731
(Dancing lightly)

1813
01:03:01,732 --> 01:03:03,232
- Where is it?
- Just as a warm-up.

1814
01:03:03,462 --> 01:03:04,462
Okay.

1815
01:03:04,632 --> 01:03:05,901
Start.

1816
01:03:05,902 --> 01:03:07,832
Do you see any couple there?

1817
01:03:07,932 --> 01:03:08,972
I don't.

1818
01:03:09,072 --> 01:03:10,131
To your left.

1819
01:03:10,132 --> 01:03:12,142
- The man on your left.
- The man.

1820
01:03:12,202 --> 01:03:14,342
Sing "Our Dream" for now.

1821
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:16,412
- Sing the song.
- Say, "Excuse me."

1822
01:03:16,612 --> 01:03:18,281
- What?
- Sing "Our Dream."

1823
01:03:18,282 --> 01:03:19,342
Where?

1824
01:03:19,512 --> 01:03:21,452
They can't hear it. I can't sing it loudly.

1825
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:23,551
- Just sing it lightly.
- They're passing by.

1826
01:03:23,552 --> 01:03:24,581
There.

1827
01:03:24,582 --> 01:03:25,752
- Jong Min.
- Next to you.

1828
01:03:29,052 --> 01:03:31,862
(Will they say Jong Min's name?)

1829
01:03:33,362 --> 01:03:34,692
(Bowing)

1830
01:03:35,462 --> 01:03:37,662
(It seems they recognized him.)

1831
01:03:37,702 --> 01:03:38,931
The white shirt.

1832
01:03:38,932 --> 01:03:40,602
Go to the person wearing white.

1833
01:03:40,932 --> 01:03:42,071
Just laugh. Keep laughing.

1834
01:03:42,072 --> 01:03:43,832
Follow them while laughing.

1835
01:03:43,872 --> 01:03:45,771
Something unbelievable

1836
01:03:45,772 --> 01:03:47,771
Ask her, "What's your dream?"

1837
01:03:47,772 --> 01:03:50,142
Something unbelievable Where are they?

1838
01:03:50,442 --> 01:03:52,111
Follow them.

1839
01:03:52,112 --> 01:03:53,612
Don't go.

1840
01:03:53,682 --> 01:03:55,881
There's someone coming. Say hello.

1841
01:03:55,882 --> 01:03:57,152
- Hello.
- Hello.

1842
01:03:57,382 --> 01:03:58,582
Hello.

1843
01:03:59,352 --> 01:04:01,822
(They're hopeful.)

1844
01:04:02,492 --> 01:04:03,951
(Will he call out Jong Min's name this time?)

1845
01:04:03,952 --> 01:04:06,692
Hello.

1846
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:10,031
- Should I take a picture with you?
- Well...

1847
01:04:10,032 --> 01:04:11,152
"It's 50 cents per picture."

1848
01:04:11,332 --> 01:04:13,678
- It's 50 cents per picture.
- "It's 30 cents for 2 pictures."

1849
01:04:13,702 --> 01:04:14,731
It's 30 cents for 2 pictures.

1850
01:04:14,732 --> 01:04:16,702
I don't have coins.

1851
01:04:17,002 --> 01:04:18,518
- "Four pictures are free."
- You don't have coins?

1852
01:04:18,542 --> 01:04:19,671
Four pictures are free.

1853
01:04:19,672 --> 01:04:21,242
Thank you.

1854
01:04:21,312 --> 01:04:24,012
(But they just keep getting shocked.)

1855
01:04:24,482 --> 01:04:25,482
(That moment)

1856
01:04:25,483 --> 01:04:26,541
Who is it?

1857
01:04:26,542 --> 01:04:27,651
(Two women were passing by.)

1858
01:04:27,652 --> 01:04:28,881
Amazing.

1859
01:04:28,882 --> 01:04:29,882
Kim Jong Min?

1860
01:04:29,883 --> 01:04:32,122
(Kim Jong Min)

1861
01:04:33,482 --> 01:04:35,222
- It's a foreigner.
- It's a foreigner.

1862
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,221
- Once.
- A foreigner said,

1863
01:04:37,222 --> 01:04:39,098
- "Kim Jong Min."
- I'll take a picture with you.

1864
01:04:39,122 --> 01:04:41,161
(His name was called once after 2 minutes.)

1865
01:04:41,162 --> 01:04:42,331
What is this?

1866
01:04:42,332 --> 01:04:44,232
(Kim Jong Min is very shocked.)

1867
01:04:45,102 --> 01:04:48,032
Where are you from? Are you okay with taking a picture?

1868
01:04:48,072 --> 01:04:49,571
Okay.

1869
01:04:49,572 --> 01:04:51,072
This is amazing.

1870
01:04:51,172 --> 01:04:53,702
Could you show them your electrocuted act?

1871
01:04:53,902 --> 01:04:55,488
- What is this? Why are you here?
- Jong Min.

1872
01:04:55,512 --> 01:04:57,611
Ask them to count to three,

1873
01:04:57,612 --> 01:04:59,712
- and act electrocuted on three.
- Right.

1874
01:04:59,742 --> 01:05:01,682
- Please count to three.
- Okay.

1875
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,322
- Please count to three.
- One, two, three.

1876
01:05:04,482 --> 01:05:05,822
(Screaming)

1877
01:05:05,852 --> 01:05:07,422
- You should do it more.
- Come on.

1878
01:05:07,752 --> 01:05:09,391
- What's wrong?
- More!

1879
01:05:09,392 --> 01:05:11,121
(He's passionately acting when he said he was embarrassed.)

1880
01:05:11,122 --> 01:05:12,691
"Please help me."

1881
01:05:12,692 --> 01:05:14,021
- "Please hold me."
- Please hold me.

1882
01:05:14,022 --> 01:05:15,062
What?

1883
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:17,831
(Is this a penalty?)

1884
01:05:17,832 --> 01:05:19,801
- Please hold me.
- What's going on?

1885
01:05:19,802 --> 01:05:21,402
- Isn't this...
- What?

1886
01:05:21,872 --> 01:05:22,872
What is this?

1887
01:05:23,672 --> 01:05:24,672
I know what it is.

1888
01:05:24,673 --> 01:05:26,601
- A bit more.
- More.

1889
01:05:26,602 --> 01:05:29,112
- What should I do?
- Get electrocuted with me.

1890
01:05:29,812 --> 01:05:30,842
(Laughing)

1891
01:05:31,282 --> 01:05:32,581
- I mean...
- Why...

1892
01:05:32,582 --> 01:05:34,481
- Watch out on rainy days.
- Thank you.

1893
01:05:34,482 --> 01:05:36,412
Bye. It's raining a lot.

1894
01:05:36,882 --> 01:05:39,521
Please go to the foreigners next.

1895
01:05:39,522 --> 01:05:41,722
- Thank you.
- Go to the foreigners.

1896
01:05:41,952 --> 01:05:43,851
Hello. Do you know?

1897
01:05:43,852 --> 01:05:44,921
- Yes.
- Yes.

1898
01:05:44,922 --> 01:05:47,062
- "Where are you from?"
- Where are you from?

1899
01:05:47,792 --> 01:05:50,261
Well, I'm... Is it 2 Days 1 Night?

1900
01:05:50,262 --> 01:05:51,632
Yes!

1901
01:05:52,002 --> 01:05:54,202
- Gosh.
- "Who's your favorite?"

1902
01:05:54,632 --> 01:05:55,972
- We're from...
- Who...

1903
01:05:56,302 --> 01:05:57,672
"Who's your favorite?"

1904
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:00,042
Who's your favorite?

1905
01:06:00,342 --> 01:06:01,612
I like you all.

1906
01:06:02,012 --> 01:06:03,672
- All.
- All?

1907
01:06:03,742 --> 01:06:04,942
"Choose only one."

1908
01:06:05,012 --> 01:06:06,182
"Only one."

1909
01:06:06,482 --> 01:06:07,512
Only one.

1910
01:06:07,982 --> 01:06:09,552
- You.
- Me?

1911
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:10,711
You?

1912
01:06:10,712 --> 01:06:12,682
- "Thank you." Get electrocuted.
- Thank you.

1913
01:06:13,082 --> 01:06:14,821
(A trembling expression of gratitude)

1914
01:06:14,822 --> 01:06:16,391
- Okay.
- Keep walking.

1915
01:06:16,392 --> 01:06:17,422
(Laughing)

1916
01:06:18,522 --> 01:06:19,522
(He's so excited.)

1917
01:06:19,523 --> 01:06:21,791
"I'm sorry. No English. Bye."

1918
01:06:21,792 --> 01:06:23,761
- Where are you from?
- Singapore.

1919
01:06:23,762 --> 01:06:25,832
Singapore? Yes.

1920
01:06:26,132 --> 01:06:28,432
- No English.
- It's okay.

1921
01:06:28,472 --> 01:06:30,231
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1922
01:06:30,232 --> 01:06:31,471
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1923
01:06:31,472 --> 01:06:33,141
(Thank you so much.)

1924
01:06:33,142 --> 01:06:34,442
- Bye!
- Bye.

1925
01:06:34,642 --> 01:06:36,312
- "Hey. Come back."
- Hey.

1926
01:06:36,412 --> 01:06:38,441
- Hey.
- "Come back."

1927
01:06:38,442 --> 01:06:40,142
Okay. "This is bonus time."

1928
01:06:40,612 --> 01:06:42,781
- This is bonus time.
- Electrocution.

1929
01:06:42,782 --> 01:06:44,428
- Electrocution.
- "I'm electrocution style."

1930
01:06:44,452 --> 01:06:45,852
I'm electrocution style.

1931
01:06:47,552 --> 01:06:48,552
(Screaming)

1932
01:06:49,122 --> 01:06:51,162
(Screaming)

1933
01:06:51,692 --> 01:06:54,022
- Bye.
- Bye.

1934
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:58,232
(A passionate fan service until the very end)

1935
01:06:59,402 --> 01:07:01,502
(Reality hits him after doing his task.)

1936
01:07:02,232 --> 01:07:04,842
(They're having so much fun.)

1937
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:06,742
(He's good.)

1938
01:07:07,042 --> 01:07:09,242
I think they'll stop being his fans.

1939
01:07:09,412 --> 01:07:11,181
Winning or not, this is fun.

1940
01:07:11,182 --> 01:07:13,342
Winning or losing doesn't matter.

1941
01:07:13,682 --> 01:07:14,751
Just laugh and go.

1942
01:07:14,752 --> 01:07:17,111
- Over there.
- Go. The foreigners.

1943
01:07:17,112 --> 01:07:18,851
- They are foreigners.
- No.

1944
01:07:18,852 --> 01:07:20,481
- The children.
- There are children.

1945
01:07:20,482 --> 01:07:21,791
- They're coming.
- "Kid."

1946
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:23,652
- Right.
- "Where is my donkey?"

1947
01:07:25,322 --> 01:07:27,932
(He wants to talk, but he can't.)

1948
01:07:28,592 --> 01:07:30,091
What should I say? "Hello?"

1949
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:31,131
Say, "Hello."

1950
01:07:31,132 --> 01:07:32,562
"Have you seen my donkey?"

1951
01:07:33,532 --> 01:07:35,501
- Hello.
- Goodness.

1952
01:07:35,502 --> 01:07:36,771
Hello, guys.

1953
01:07:36,772 --> 01:07:38,702
- Hello.
- Hello.

1954
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:40,771
Have you seen my donkey?

1955
01:07:40,772 --> 01:07:41,772
- I haven't.
- Donkey?

1956
01:07:41,773 --> 01:07:43,142
Have you seen my donkey?

1957
01:07:43,372 --> 01:07:45,481
I came here from Busan on a donkey. You haven't seen the donkey, right?

1958
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:46,782
I haven't.

1959
01:07:47,212 --> 01:07:48,752
Is this "Boss in the Mirror?"

1960
01:07:48,782 --> 01:07:49,782
The boss...

1961
01:07:49,952 --> 01:07:51,958
- "Then memorize the times tables."
- "Four times nine?"

1962
01:07:51,982 --> 01:07:53,421
"Shall we play the times table game?"

1963
01:07:53,422 --> 01:07:54,991
- Are you good at times tables?
- "Four times nine?"

1964
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:56,522
- He's good.
- He's very good.

1965
01:07:57,392 --> 01:07:59,662
- Four times nine?
- Thirty-six.

1966
01:08:00,092 --> 01:08:01,538
- Five times seven?
- "I don't know."

1967
01:08:01,562 --> 01:08:02,761
- Five times seven?
- "I don't know."

1968
01:08:02,762 --> 01:08:04,131
It's 47,317.

1969
01:08:04,132 --> 01:08:05,961
Is it 37,355?

1970
01:08:05,962 --> 01:08:07,102
Just get electrocuted! Go!

1971
01:08:08,832 --> 01:08:10,632
(Laughing)

1972
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:13,342
Bye.

1973
01:08:16,012 --> 01:08:17,342
They're recording that.

1974
01:08:18,642 --> 01:08:19,882
I'm about to cry.

1975
01:08:20,842 --> 01:08:22,981
Let's take a picture. Come here.

1976
01:08:22,982 --> 01:08:24,498
(Will he not hear his name this time?)

1977
01:08:24,522 --> 01:08:26,452
Are you a fan? Who do you like?

1978
01:08:27,022 --> 01:08:29,051
I like Kim Jong Min.

1979
01:08:29,052 --> 01:08:30,092
Really?

1980
01:08:30,222 --> 01:08:31,222
I like Kim Jong Min.

1981
01:08:31,223 --> 01:08:33,021
(Kim Jong Min's mission of getting his name called out twice ends.)

1982
01:08:33,022 --> 01:08:35,232
- Kim Jong Min.
- No way. That was two times.

1983
01:08:36,662 --> 01:08:37,731
(He takes a picture with the children.)

1984
01:08:37,732 --> 01:08:39,301
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1985
01:08:39,302 --> 01:08:41,471
Bye. Study hard and be healthy.

1986
01:08:41,472 --> 01:08:42,931
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1987
01:08:42,932 --> 01:08:44,442
I got struck by lightning!

1988
01:08:44,802 --> 01:08:47,072
(He does it again even without the order for the kids.)

1989
01:08:50,412 --> 01:08:51,841
"Thank you. You're..."

1990
01:08:51,842 --> 01:08:53,681
"the hope and future of our country."

1991
01:08:53,682 --> 01:08:55,882
"You're the hope and future of our country."

1992
01:08:56,352 --> 01:08:58,122
This is like a public service announcement.

1993
01:08:59,122 --> 01:09:00,621
It must be hard.

1994
01:09:00,622 --> 01:09:03,151
- Well done. Come back now.
- You can come back now.

1995
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:04,322
Should we have one more team?

1996
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:07,692
- I feel bad.
- We just want to bully him.

1997
01:09:07,932 --> 01:09:10,361
- Come back.
- I love you, Honey!

1998
01:09:10,362 --> 01:09:12,002
Look at Hannam Bridge and shout that out.

1999
01:09:12,962 --> 01:09:14,201
(He looks around in embarrassment.)

2000
01:09:14,202 --> 01:09:16,122
- You're just bullying him.
- I love you, Honey.

2001
01:09:16,632 --> 01:09:18,102
I love you, Honey!

2002
01:09:19,942 --> 01:09:20,972
Well done.

2003
01:09:23,772 --> 01:09:24,882
We're just bullying him.

2004
01:09:25,082 --> 01:09:27,142
- I just...
- We just wanted to bully him.

2005
01:09:27,612 --> 01:09:28,681
It's so nice the foreigners...

2006
01:09:28,682 --> 01:09:29,752
- noticed him.
- Right.

2007
01:09:30,412 --> 01:09:32,181
- They were Singaporean.
- "Kim Jong Min?"

2008
01:09:32,182 --> 01:09:34,081
- That's right.
- "Kim Jong Min?"

2009
01:09:34,082 --> 01:09:35,892
- "2 Days 1 Night."
- Right.

2010
01:09:35,952 --> 01:09:38,461
People in Singapore often recognize us.

2011
01:09:38,462 --> 01:09:40,661
Right. Many people watch the show. Indonesian people watch it too.

2012
01:09:40,662 --> 01:09:43,531
Many people watch from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore.

2013
01:09:43,532 --> 01:09:44,862
This is so funny.

2014
01:09:45,262 --> 01:09:46,961
It's so funny.

2015
01:09:46,962 --> 01:09:48,071
I'm hungry because I laughed.

2016
01:09:48,072 --> 01:09:49,132
I'm also hungry.

2017
01:09:49,202 --> 01:09:50,431
Jong Min is back.

2018
01:09:50,432 --> 01:09:51,901
(The superstar returns after being struck by lightning.)

2019
01:09:51,902 --> 01:09:52,902
Well done.

2020
01:09:52,903 --> 01:09:54,571
The superstar of 2 Days 1 Night.

2021
01:09:54,572 --> 01:09:56,241
It was crazy today.

2022
01:09:56,242 --> 01:09:57,711
You were at your best today.

2023
01:09:57,712 --> 01:09:59,311
- It was crazy.
- This...

2024
01:09:59,312 --> 01:10:01,611
- Well done.
- I don't remember other things,

2025
01:10:01,612 --> 01:10:03,111
but they were glad to see me.

2026
01:10:03,112 --> 01:10:04,411
- Right.
- The people I met...

2027
01:10:04,412 --> 01:10:05,951
- were glad to see me.
- They were really glad to see us.

2028
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:07,221
- Right.
- I'm grateful.

2029
01:10:07,222 --> 01:10:08,421
The daughter was really happy.

2030
01:10:08,422 --> 01:10:10,222
- Yes. You adored her.
- Yes.

2031
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:11,991
Are we going to eat now?

2032
01:10:11,992 --> 01:10:13,591
- Yes. We're going to eat.
- Okay.

2033
01:10:13,592 --> 01:10:14,891
- Who won?
- We...

2034
01:10:14,892 --> 01:10:16,231
- We won.
- Team Lim Joon Ho won.

2035
01:10:16,232 --> 01:10:17,431
We lost.

2036
01:10:17,432 --> 01:10:18,461
Did we lose?

2037
01:10:18,462 --> 01:10:21,061
If we're going somewhere filled with memories,

2038
01:10:21,062 --> 01:10:24,602
is it Lee Joon's kimchi fried rice restaurant?

2039
01:10:24,772 --> 01:10:26,642
Is it a snack food special?

2040
01:10:26,842 --> 01:10:29,072
Is it one of the places we mentioned?

2041
01:10:29,342 --> 01:10:31,281
It holds someone's memory.

2042
01:10:31,282 --> 01:10:32,311
It's the menu of someone's memory.

2043
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:34,111
It's a nearby restaurant.

2044
01:10:34,112 --> 01:10:35,411
A nearby restaurant?

2045
01:10:35,412 --> 01:10:36,951
It has a great night view.

2046
01:10:36,952 --> 01:10:38,022
N Seoul Tower?

2047
01:10:39,182 --> 01:10:43,452
(Among the top night view spots representing Seoul, )

2048
01:10:44,692 --> 01:10:49,062
(would it be N Seoul Tower?)

2049
01:10:49,362 --> 01:10:51,561
- We're going to Mount Nam, right?
- It must be Mount Nam.

2050
01:10:51,562 --> 01:10:52,831
- N Seoul Tower...
- I went to Mount Nam a lot...

2051
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,361
to eat pork cutlet.

2052
01:10:54,362 --> 01:10:56,101
Does someone have a story about the pork cutlet?

2053
01:10:56,102 --> 01:10:59,301
During my time, they hung padlocks...

2054
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:01,411
- on "We Got Married,"
- Right.

2055
01:11:01,412 --> 01:11:02,611
- and that was really popular.
- Right.

2056
01:11:02,612 --> 01:11:03,941
- That's right. Jo Kwon and Gain.
- So...

2057
01:11:03,942 --> 01:11:06,042
that was a place where you had to go...

2058
01:11:06,282 --> 01:11:07,881
when you were even getting to know one another.

2059
01:11:07,882 --> 01:11:10,582
"Do you want to go to N Seoul Tower?" That was a must.

2060
01:11:11,182 --> 01:11:13,682
(A love padlock filled with genuine love)

2061
01:11:13,822 --> 01:11:16,652
There's a padlock I hung there with my wife.

2062
01:11:16,722 --> 01:11:18,592
- For me...
- You have one too?

2063
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:20,061
When I was in high school,

2064
01:11:20,062 --> 01:11:22,291
I used to work at a clock factory.

2065
01:11:22,292 --> 01:11:23,661
- A clock factory?
- Yes.

2066
01:11:23,662 --> 01:11:26,462
- Alarm clocks?
- Yes. I made them...

2067
01:11:26,702 --> 01:11:28,931
and delivered them.

2068
01:11:28,932 --> 01:11:31,371
I went up Mount Nam...

2069
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:33,741
by truck. We had to go through there.

2070
01:11:33,742 --> 01:11:35,842
I looked at the night view from there...

2071
01:11:35,872 --> 01:11:37,812
and thought what would become of my life.

2072
01:11:38,312 --> 01:11:40,811
- I would look at the stars...
- Right.

2073
01:11:40,812 --> 01:11:42,212
It shines a lot.

2074
01:11:42,552 --> 01:11:44,982
I worried a lot about my future.

2075
01:11:45,282 --> 01:11:47,052
Was that when you were in the dance team?

2076
01:11:47,282 --> 01:11:50,422
Since I couldn't make money from dancing, I worked part-time.

2077
01:11:50,792 --> 01:11:52,621
- That's how I lived.
- You had two jobs.

2078
01:11:52,622 --> 01:11:54,762
I had two jobs.

2079
01:11:54,962 --> 01:11:57,632
- That's the...
- Did you get enlightened?

2080
01:11:57,932 --> 01:12:00,032
I felt something there.

2081
01:12:00,202 --> 01:12:02,202
I realized I was alive.

2082
01:12:02,232 --> 01:12:03,708
(The lights in the night sky consoled Jong Min a lot.)

2083
01:12:03,732 --> 01:12:06,201
- I'm curious what we'll eat.
- You are?

2084
01:12:06,202 --> 01:12:08,188
I'm suddenly craving the pork cutlet near Mount Nam.

2085
01:12:08,212 --> 01:12:10,141
I really wanted to eat pork cutlet.

2086
01:12:10,142 --> 01:12:12,218
(Which One Night Ribbon restaurant is waiting for the members?)

2087
01:12:12,242 --> 01:12:13,942
Hello.

2088
01:12:14,982 --> 01:12:17,282
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

2089
01:12:17,682 --> 01:12:18,852
Look at the autographs.

2090
01:12:19,122 --> 01:12:22,152
(The wall is filled with autographs of famous people.)

2091
01:12:22,252 --> 01:12:23,691
They already knew this place.

2092
01:12:23,692 --> 01:12:24,722
Amazing.

2093
01:12:25,022 --> 01:12:26,722
It's a famous place.

2094
01:12:27,362 --> 01:12:28,692
The food must be good.

2095
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:32,331
This is the first pork cutlet restaurant...

2096
01:12:32,332 --> 01:12:33,561
to open near Mount Nam.

2097
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:34,731
You must be hungry now.

2098
01:12:34,732 --> 01:12:36,072
- Yes.
- Of course.

2099
01:12:36,572 --> 01:12:38,871
This is a famous pork cutlet restaurant...

2100
01:12:38,872 --> 01:12:40,902
located at the foot of Mount Nam.

2101
01:12:41,242 --> 01:12:43,722
They say the combination of the classic Western pork cutlet...

2102
01:12:43,772 --> 01:12:46,182
and spicy mackerel kimchi stew...

2103
01:12:46,482 --> 01:12:48,652
is a perfect match.

2104
01:12:49,112 --> 01:12:50,281
- First of all...
- Then...

2105
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:51,451
We should get one pork cutlet dish each.

2106
01:12:51,452 --> 01:12:52,481
- I'll get half and half.
- Me too.

2107
01:12:52,482 --> 01:12:53,482
I'll get the giant pork cutlet.

2108
01:12:53,483 --> 01:12:55,083
I'll get the half-and-half meal as well.

2109
01:12:55,192 --> 01:12:56,451
Three half-and-half meals, a mackerel meal,

2110
01:12:56,452 --> 01:12:57,452
and a soft tofu meal.

2111
01:12:57,453 --> 01:12:58,922
- Right.
- Me too.

2112
01:13:00,192 --> 01:13:02,192
- Gosh, that must be good.
- Okay.

2113
01:13:02,862 --> 01:13:05,032
Why did you do a terrible job, Jong Min?

2114
01:13:06,262 --> 01:13:08,502
(Out of words)

2115
01:13:08,572 --> 01:13:10,832
Everything was good up until the very end.

2116
01:13:10,972 --> 01:13:12,401
We all laughed our heads off a while ago.

2117
01:13:12,402 --> 01:13:13,702
I feel resentment at you now.

2118
01:13:13,742 --> 01:13:16,171
- Joon.
- Joon should get the food.

2119
01:13:16,172 --> 01:13:17,611
(At that moment!)

2120
01:13:17,612 --> 01:13:19,718
- Mount Nam pork cutlet.
- How long has it been for this?

2121
01:13:19,742 --> 01:13:21,142
Gosh, it's so big!

2122
01:13:21,382 --> 01:13:23,551
This is actually our first meal.

2123
01:13:23,552 --> 01:13:25,651
(The pork cutlet that must be eaten at Mount Nam.)

2124
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:27,852
- Finally!
- Where's the soup?

2125
01:13:28,752 --> 01:13:30,821
This is actually our first meal.

2126
01:13:30,822 --> 01:13:32,261
(A marvelous sight that makes people drool)

2127
01:13:32,262 --> 01:13:35,032
This is driving me crazy. It smells amazing.

2128
01:13:35,732 --> 01:13:39,562
(Let's take a sniff of it.)

2129
01:13:40,232 --> 01:13:42,131
The smell of fried food.

2130
01:13:42,132 --> 01:13:44,532
It smells delicious to the point that it makes my head hurt.

2131
01:13:44,742 --> 01:13:46,142
- Gosh.
- It's this one, right?

2132
01:13:46,202 --> 01:13:47,372
The kimchi stew?

2133
01:13:47,602 --> 01:13:50,541
- Se Yoon loves this.
- The kimchi stew?

2134
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:51,782
Se Yoon would love this smell.

2135
01:13:52,612 --> 01:13:53,612
(Super thrilled)

2136
01:13:53,613 --> 01:13:55,352
- Right?
- The sour kimchi smells great.

2137
01:13:56,352 --> 01:13:58,051
- Sour kimchi.
- Sour kimchi.

2138
01:13:58,052 --> 01:13:59,412
- Awesome.
- It's making me drool.

2139
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,992
Right. I started drooling after smelling it.

2140
01:14:02,252 --> 01:14:04,221
I want to have some after putting in some rice.

2141
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:05,922
- Gosh.
- Like gukbap.

2142
01:14:06,022 --> 01:14:07,192
Mackerel gukbap.

2143
01:14:08,232 --> 01:14:10,292
I'm seriously about to go crazy.

2144
01:14:11,562 --> 01:14:13,362
- Let's eat it together.
- It's the mackerel.

2145
01:14:14,362 --> 01:14:15,731
(He starts with a bite of the mackerel kimchi stew.)

2146
01:14:15,732 --> 01:14:16,831
Gosh!

2147
01:14:16,832 --> 01:14:18,241
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- It tastes so good.

2148
01:14:18,242 --> 01:14:19,682
I can tell it's good from the smell.

2149
01:14:20,342 --> 01:14:24,672
(The soup has a rich taste as it was cooked for a long time.)

2150
01:14:25,442 --> 01:14:28,042
Gosh, this is a work of art.

2151
01:14:28,282 --> 01:14:30,051
Why is the pepper here?

2152
01:14:30,052 --> 01:14:32,782
It's for the soup! Gosh!

2153
01:14:34,322 --> 01:14:37,792
It's the classic Western soup that was served in the past.

2154
01:14:38,052 --> 01:14:39,221
I'll give it a try.

2155
01:14:39,222 --> 01:14:40,621
(DinDin tries the soup first.)

2156
01:14:40,622 --> 01:14:41,832
Thank you for the food.

2157
01:14:41,992 --> 01:14:44,361
- I'll make sure to enjoy it.
- Gosh, the soup!

2158
01:14:44,362 --> 01:14:45,802
- It's the classic taste.
- Right.

2159
01:14:46,302 --> 01:14:48,331
- Thank you.
- Try it when it's warm.

2160
01:14:48,332 --> 01:14:50,701
- What kind of soup is it?
- It's totally classic.

2161
01:14:50,702 --> 01:14:51,841
What kind of soup is it?

2162
01:14:51,842 --> 01:14:54,841
It's the soup served at Western restaurants.

2163
01:14:54,842 --> 01:14:56,541
People have different styles of eating pork cutlet.

2164
01:14:56,542 --> 01:14:58,071
I cut it up first.

2165
01:14:58,072 --> 01:14:59,981
There are people who hate it being cut up.

2166
01:14:59,982 --> 01:15:01,282
There are people who hate that.

2167
01:15:03,952 --> 01:15:08,692
(A perfect day to use the knife)

2168
01:15:10,052 --> 01:15:11,992
I'll try the pork cutlet.

2169
01:15:14,492 --> 01:15:15,592
It's a cream soup.

2170
01:15:18,362 --> 01:15:20,961
(It's so good.)

2171
01:15:20,962 --> 01:15:22,532
This place is amazing.

2172
01:15:23,432 --> 01:15:27,372
(DinDin tries the kimchi stew.)

2173
01:15:27,642 --> 01:15:29,912
Gosh, the smell of the mackerel...

2174
01:15:30,142 --> 01:15:32,082
and the sour kimchi...

2175
01:15:33,082 --> 01:15:34,481
is amazing.

2176
01:15:34,482 --> 01:15:37,512
(Perfect match with the kimchi)

2177
01:15:37,552 --> 01:15:39,222
Gosh, that looks delicious.

2178
01:15:39,782 --> 01:15:41,951
- Can't the mackerel...
- Check out the mackerel!

2179
01:15:41,952 --> 01:15:43,351
Be eaten as a whole?

2180
01:15:43,352 --> 01:15:45,591
You have to eat it with the bones. They will feel soft.

2181
01:15:45,592 --> 01:15:46,762
- Right?
- Yes.

2182
01:15:47,122 --> 01:15:49,092
- Gosh.
- It's hot.

2183
01:15:49,292 --> 01:15:51,501
(Even the bones of the mackerel melt inside the mouth.)

2184
01:15:51,502 --> 01:15:52,962
- Gosh.
- It's so good.

2185
01:15:53,002 --> 01:15:54,701
The mackerel is good.

2186
01:15:54,702 --> 01:15:56,808
(Even the bones of the mackerel melt inside the mouth.)

2187
01:15:56,832 --> 01:15:59,441
If I get given a plastic bottle,

2188
01:15:59,442 --> 01:16:01,272
I'll be able to gather so much saliva.

2189
01:16:01,642 --> 01:16:03,212
I can't stop drooling.

2190
01:16:03,672 --> 01:16:04,911
I can gather a lot in no time.

2191
01:16:04,912 --> 01:16:06,281
(Drooling at the sight of the sweet and sour kimchi stew)

2192
01:16:06,282 --> 01:16:07,442
Gosh, the mackerel stew.

2193
01:16:07,582 --> 01:16:09,212
In my opinion,

2194
01:16:09,952 --> 01:16:11,181
the soft tofu stew can be eaten on its own.

2195
01:16:11,182 --> 01:16:13,982
But the pork cutlet must be eaten with the kimchi stew.

2196
01:16:14,522 --> 01:16:16,491
- There's a certain combination.
- Really?

2197
01:16:16,492 --> 01:16:18,021
There's a reason why these two are eaten together.

2198
01:16:18,022 --> 01:16:19,022
It's insane.

2199
01:16:19,023 --> 01:16:20,561
They taste even better when eaten together.

2200
01:16:20,562 --> 01:16:21,991
They work together?

2201
01:16:21,992 --> 01:16:24,661
Yes. One is sweet, and one is salty.

2202
01:16:24,662 --> 01:16:27,761
I came here from time to time since I knew this place.

2203
01:16:27,762 --> 01:16:29,278
I think the food tastes even better now.

2204
01:16:29,302 --> 01:16:31,031
- It must be the same.
- No. It tastes even better.

2205
01:16:31,032 --> 01:16:32,602
Why is the food so good today?

2206
01:16:33,402 --> 01:16:36,772
(I'll get an extra bowl of rice!)

2207
01:16:37,512 --> 01:16:40,412
(His hand naturally reaches out for the mackerel kimchi stew.)

2208
01:16:41,112 --> 01:16:45,882
(Joon falls in love with the mackerel kimchi stew.)

2209
01:16:46,682 --> 01:16:48,991
It's been a while for Joon...

2210
01:16:48,992 --> 01:16:50,528
- to eat so well like this.
- It's so good.

2211
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:52,361
He had two bowls of rice.

2212
01:16:52,362 --> 01:16:54,361
Right. I finished two bowls.

2213
01:16:54,362 --> 01:16:56,491
(It's been a while for him to have two bowls of rice.)

2214
01:16:56,492 --> 01:17:00,201
Give us something before we start stealing food.

2215
01:17:00,202 --> 01:17:01,571
Give us anything.

2216
01:17:01,572 --> 01:17:03,671
- We might steal food.
- You said you weren't hungry.

2217
01:17:03,672 --> 01:17:05,702
I almost threw up because I was so hungry.

2218
01:17:06,172 --> 01:17:07,472
We were on our bikes.

2219
01:17:08,002 --> 01:17:10,311
We feel hungry because we were on our bikes.

2220
01:17:10,312 --> 01:17:11,788
(Maintaining an empty stomach after working out)

2221
01:17:11,812 --> 01:17:13,512
Gosh, even the pork cutlet is really good.

2222
01:17:14,182 --> 01:17:16,411
We wouldn't have been jealous if it was a feast.

2223
01:17:16,412 --> 01:17:18,081
We all know what it tastes like,

2224
01:17:18,082 --> 01:17:19,522
- and it's in our memories.
- Right.

2225
01:17:19,782 --> 01:17:21,221
That's why...

2226
01:17:21,222 --> 01:17:23,852
Watching them eat that feels even tougher.

2227
01:17:24,252 --> 01:17:25,662
I'm sorry for saying this.

2228
01:17:27,322 --> 01:17:29,061
I feel bad for the fried fish.

2229
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,691
- Why?
- I was slightly torn...

2230
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:32,431
with whether or not to order the fried fish.

2231
01:17:32,432 --> 01:17:34,272
I thought about just ordering the pork cutlet.

2232
01:17:35,202 --> 01:17:36,202
(The fried fish is amazing.)

2233
01:17:36,203 --> 01:17:37,731
- It's a work of art.
- This is a work of art.

2234
01:17:37,732 --> 01:17:40,332
Are the pork cutlet and fried fish neck and neck with each other?

2235
01:17:40,542 --> 01:17:42,442
- I choose the fried fish.
- Really?

2236
01:17:42,512 --> 01:17:45,341
The balance of the crispiness and softness...

2237
01:17:45,342 --> 01:17:47,812
is just amazing.

2238
01:17:48,142 --> 01:17:50,081
You know this tartar sauce, right?

2239
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,821
- Right.
- It's...

2240
01:17:51,822 --> 01:17:53,382
- Gosh, it's good.
- really thick.

2241
01:17:53,922 --> 01:17:55,251
It's amazing.

2242
01:17:55,252 --> 01:17:56,792
Which do you like better, Sae Ho?

2243
01:17:57,322 --> 01:17:58,592
I understand why DinDin...

2244
01:17:58,792 --> 01:18:01,361
- felt bad for the fried fish.
- Why?

2245
01:18:01,362 --> 01:18:03,492
It's hard to describe the crispiness with words.

2246
01:18:03,662 --> 01:18:05,902
The thick sauce...

2247
01:18:06,002 --> 01:18:07,802
goes so well with its crispiness.

2248
01:18:07,962 --> 01:18:09,401
- It tastes so good.
- Is that so?

2249
01:18:09,402 --> 01:18:11,208
(Crispiness that is hard to describe with words)

2250
01:18:11,232 --> 01:18:14,802
(Taking a big bite)

2251
01:18:15,072 --> 01:18:17,671
It's my first time feeling this way.

2252
01:18:17,672 --> 01:18:20,781
I had the thought of wanting to steal someone's food.

2253
01:18:20,782 --> 01:18:21,981
- While using violence.
- Go for it.

2254
01:18:21,982 --> 01:18:24,158
- Don't just think about it.
- I want to grab it like this.

2255
01:18:24,182 --> 01:18:26,521
Team New and Old Love must eat as well.

2256
01:18:26,522 --> 01:18:27,858
- Team New and Old Love.
- It's so good.

2257
01:18:27,882 --> 01:18:29,821
- Please serve them.
- At least some rice.

2258
01:18:29,822 --> 01:18:31,491
We would still be served with something to eat, won't we?

2259
01:18:31,492 --> 01:18:33,398
- Something is being served.
- Isn't it the stew?

2260
01:18:33,422 --> 01:18:34,462
Stew?

2261
01:18:35,832 --> 01:18:37,132
- What?
- What?

2262
01:18:37,262 --> 01:18:38,962
Warm bowls of rice...

2263
01:18:39,102 --> 01:18:40,732
and crunchy kkakdugi.

2264
01:18:40,862 --> 01:18:41,971
Shall we give it a try?

2265
01:18:41,972 --> 01:18:46,572
(They relieve their hunger with rice.)

2266
01:18:47,642 --> 01:18:49,711
It's such a poor meal today, isn't it?

2267
01:18:49,712 --> 01:18:51,042
- It's the worst.
- Right.

2268
01:18:51,112 --> 01:18:52,688
Throughout my whole time on this show...

2269
01:18:52,712 --> 01:18:54,442
It's the worst meal in four years.

2270
01:18:54,642 --> 01:18:58,112
Se Yoon. Your cameraman is eating right now.

2271
01:18:58,382 --> 01:19:00,552
You can't move around a lot.

2272
01:19:01,952 --> 01:19:02,991
What?

2273
01:19:02,992 --> 01:19:04,051
(His cameraman went to eat during the shoot.)

2274
01:19:04,052 --> 01:19:05,492
- Hold on.
- Why?

2275
01:19:05,622 --> 01:19:07,622
We're in the middle of a shoot,

2276
01:19:08,022 --> 01:19:10,062
and the cameraman went to eat?

2277
01:19:10,892 --> 01:19:13,531
He moved away instead of eating while shooting?

2278
01:19:13,532 --> 01:19:14,561
(Left unattended)

2279
01:19:14,562 --> 01:19:17,231
- He's amazing.
- He shouldn't move around?

2280
01:19:17,232 --> 01:19:18,802
(It sounds quite ridiculous.)

2281
01:19:19,072 --> 01:19:20,641
Don't we look nice as we aren't making a fuss...

2282
01:19:20,642 --> 01:19:22,412
and just eating what we're given?

2283
01:19:23,412 --> 01:19:24,641
You've all worked hard.

2284
01:19:24,642 --> 01:19:26,211
- You want to try the food, right?
- Definitely!

2285
01:19:26,212 --> 01:19:27,311
- Right.
- All right.

2286
01:19:27,312 --> 01:19:28,312
(We definitely want to try the food.)

2287
01:19:28,313 --> 01:19:30,513
You will be given a chance as you must be disappointed.

2288
01:19:30,582 --> 01:19:32,552
- You all know the Zero Game, right?
- Right.

2289
01:19:32,922 --> 01:19:35,151
If you manage to defend three consecutive times,

2290
01:19:35,152 --> 01:19:37,152
we will order you one dish of your choice.

2291
01:19:38,152 --> 01:19:39,721
- One each?
- Just one.

2292
01:19:39,722 --> 01:19:41,442
Jong Min is great at coming up with a plan.

2293
01:19:42,292 --> 01:19:43,731
(The three gather up right away to come up with a plan.)

2294
01:19:43,732 --> 01:19:45,402
- It's 1, 2, or 3.
- Right.

2295
01:19:46,802 --> 01:19:48,202
"One" starts with an O.

2296
01:19:48,362 --> 01:19:50,172
"Two" and "three" start with a T.

2297
01:19:51,232 --> 01:19:53,972
We should all get up when he calls out "one."

2298
01:19:55,342 --> 01:19:56,441
(A plan based on the numbers called out)

2299
01:19:56,442 --> 01:19:58,911
We should stay still when he calls out "two" or "three."

2300
01:19:58,912 --> 01:20:00,211
- That's what we'll do?
- Right.

2301
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,482
- All right.
- Let's go for it.

2302
01:20:01,642 --> 01:20:03,351
- We'll begin.
- Will this work?

2303
01:20:03,352 --> 01:20:05,312
You have to avoid getting caught for three times.

2304
01:20:05,422 --> 01:20:06,582
Here we go.

2305
01:20:07,082 --> 01:20:09,352
One, two, three. One!

2306
01:20:10,152 --> 01:20:11,251
Pass.

2307
01:20:11,252 --> 01:20:12,922
- Why didn't you get up?
- I'm sorry!

2308
01:20:13,492 --> 01:20:14,821
I can't follow the plan.

2309
01:20:14,822 --> 01:20:17,561
All right. One, two, three. One!

2310
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:18,962
(He calls out "one" once again!)

2311
01:20:19,102 --> 01:20:21,061
One, two, three. One!

2312
01:20:21,062 --> 01:20:22,631
(Two people get up.)

2313
01:20:22,632 --> 01:20:24,731
- Okay.
- Jong Min was a bit slow. Okay.

2314
01:20:24,732 --> 01:20:25,741
- Okay.
- Okay.

2315
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:27,278
Do we have just one more left? Is that it?

2316
01:20:27,302 --> 01:20:29,672
One, two, three. Two!

2317
01:20:30,672 --> 01:20:33,042
One, two, three. Two!

2318
01:20:33,082 --> 01:20:38,782
(Seon Ho got up with "two?")

2319
01:20:39,022 --> 01:20:41,522
One, two, three. Two!

2320
01:20:42,292 --> 01:20:43,551
Okay!

2321
01:20:43,552 --> 01:20:45,122
(Only Seon Ho got up.)

2322
01:20:45,522 --> 01:20:48,161
(They win the taster meal.)

2323
01:20:48,162 --> 01:20:49,531
I wasn't supposed to get up for the last one, right?

2324
01:20:49,532 --> 01:20:51,932
- You weren't supposed to get up.
- He was so surprised.

2325
01:20:52,062 --> 01:20:53,931
- What was the plan?
- We won't tell you.

2326
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,372
It's a secret.

2327
01:20:55,572 --> 01:20:57,972
- It will work every time.
- What do you want?

2328
01:20:58,132 --> 01:20:59,842
The assorted meal of all three.

2329
01:21:00,542 --> 01:21:02,911
- We can't choose that?
- The half-and-half meal?

2330
01:21:02,912 --> 01:21:05,382
You serve a lot of salad when asked for more, right?

2331
01:21:05,882 --> 01:21:08,111
Please give us a lot with the pork cutlet.

2332
01:21:08,112 --> 01:21:09,681
Do you serve 2kg of corn when asked as well?

2333
01:21:09,682 --> 01:21:11,002
It should be as big as Mount Nam.

2334
01:21:11,482 --> 01:21:14,521
I'm not going to lie. A soft drink with this meal...

2335
01:21:14,522 --> 01:21:16,721
would feel like being in paradise.

2336
01:21:16,722 --> 01:21:19,821
If you win the game, we will get you drinks.

2337
01:21:19,822 --> 01:21:22,191
- Okay.
- Here we go.

2338
01:21:22,192 --> 01:21:23,261
(The 2nd round of Zero People for drinks)

2339
01:21:23,262 --> 01:21:25,301
One, two, three.

2340
01:21:25,302 --> 01:21:26,332
One!

2341
01:21:27,332 --> 01:21:28,332
One!

2342
01:21:28,972 --> 01:21:30,731
(Failing right away)

2343
01:21:30,732 --> 01:21:32,141
Did we lose?

2344
01:21:32,142 --> 01:21:33,341
We're good at this.

2345
01:21:33,342 --> 01:21:34,841
- This is hard to do.
- He got up at "one."

2346
01:21:34,842 --> 01:21:36,148
I thought we were supposed to get the right number.

2347
01:21:36,172 --> 01:21:37,172
- Right.
- Aren't we to get the right number?

2348
01:21:37,173 --> 01:21:38,511
I got up as we were told to get the right number.

2349
01:21:38,512 --> 01:21:40,482
- Get a different number? Okay.
- Okay.

2350
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:41,851
What's wrong with you?

2351
01:21:41,852 --> 01:21:43,081
- That was what I heard.
- Okay.

2352
01:21:43,082 --> 01:21:44,681
We heard the rules. I'm sorry.

2353
01:21:44,682 --> 01:21:46,382
(We heard the rules.)

2354
01:21:46,722 --> 01:21:48,181
Can you get that, Joon?

2355
01:21:48,182 --> 01:21:49,191
(The taster meal gets served at the perfect time.)

2356
01:21:49,192 --> 01:21:50,991
- There's so much food!
- We got an assorted meal.

2357
01:21:50,992 --> 01:21:53,291
- They gave us so much food.
- They gave you guys a lot.

2358
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:55,022
- Okay!
- They gave us so much.

2359
01:21:55,292 --> 01:21:56,961
- Did you do kendo? Here.
- What?

2360
01:21:56,962 --> 01:21:58,731
- I can cut it up.
- Cut it accurately.

2361
01:21:58,732 --> 01:22:00,731
- Exactly three pieces, right?
- Three big pieces.

2362
01:22:00,732 --> 01:22:02,501
- I like eating big pieces.
- Three pieces.

2363
01:22:02,502 --> 01:22:04,502
- All right.
- Should we try this first?

2364
01:22:04,772 --> 01:22:06,341
- Right.
- The fried fish.

2365
01:22:06,342 --> 01:22:07,541
- The fried fish first?
- Right.

2366
01:22:07,542 --> 01:22:08,542
Go.

2367
01:22:08,742 --> 01:22:10,742
(Cheers for Team New and Old Love!)

2368
01:22:13,682 --> 01:22:15,752
(It's so good.)

2369
01:22:17,812 --> 01:22:20,921
(They make big smiles as soon as they eat it.)

2370
01:22:20,922 --> 01:22:22,251
- Right.
- It's so crispy.

2371
01:22:22,252 --> 01:22:24,592
The fried fish is amazing, isn't it?

2372
01:22:24,822 --> 01:22:25,822
Gosh.

2373
01:22:26,922 --> 01:22:28,362
It's so crispy.

2374
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:31,861
(What is this?)

2375
01:22:31,862 --> 01:22:34,462
- The sauce is wild.
- Gosh, what is this?

2376
01:22:35,062 --> 01:22:36,372
It's so good.

2377
01:22:37,932 --> 01:22:39,541
(He takes a big bite of the pork cutlet this time.)

2378
01:22:39,542 --> 01:22:40,802
I'll have some rice first.

2379
01:22:41,242 --> 01:22:42,412
The salad next.

2380
01:22:42,812 --> 01:22:44,448
- Now, it's the pork cutlet.
- They gave them a lot.

2381
01:22:44,472 --> 01:22:46,882
Gosh, I should've just stolen their food.

2382
01:22:47,042 --> 01:22:48,212
I'll give it a try.

2383
01:22:50,352 --> 01:22:52,081
- What?
- Thank you, Jong Hyun.

2384
01:22:52,082 --> 01:22:53,722
- Oh, right.
- Thank you.

2385
01:22:54,352 --> 01:22:56,992
- Please enjoy your food.
- Okay.

2386
01:22:57,322 --> 01:23:01,692
Now we will go enjoy a special night in Seoul.

2387
01:23:01,762 --> 01:23:02,961
- A special night?
- Yes.

2388
01:23:02,962 --> 01:23:04,892
Why aren't we going to the base camp?

2389
01:23:06,002 --> 01:23:07,362
It's strange.

2390
01:23:07,702 --> 01:23:09,371
- There's no base camp today?
- No base camp?

2391
01:23:09,372 --> 01:23:10,372
(At this point, they start to be curious.)

2392
01:23:10,373 --> 01:23:13,142
- We still have a lot to enjoy.
- We're wandering around all day.

2393
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,348
The whole day, we just stayed by the Han River.

2394
01:23:15,372 --> 01:23:16,571
You're happy, right?

2395
01:23:16,572 --> 01:23:18,011
I'm really happy. I mean...

2396
01:23:18,012 --> 01:23:19,582
I love Seoul so much.

2397
01:23:19,882 --> 01:23:22,452
Seriously, I want to go around Seoul all night.

(Where's the next spot to enjoy a special night in Seoul?)

2399

(The moment the sun sets, the day's hustle and bustle fades.)

2400
01:23:32,622 --> 01:23:36,362
(And the splendor of the night begins in Seoul.)

2401

(When the hidden splendor shines across the whole world, )

2403
01:23:48,502 --> 01:23:52,412
(it's time to enjoy the romance allowed only at night.)

It's Mount Nam and the N Seoul Tower.

2407
01:24:01,722 --> 01:24:04,292
The N Seoul Tower looks pretty. Take a look at it from here.

2408
01:24:04,852 --> 01:24:06,522
I've never been here before.

2409
01:24:07,022 --> 01:24:09,131
It feels different at night.

2410
01:24:09,132 --> 01:24:11,592
It's quite atmospheric when it rains.

2411
01:24:11,732 --> 01:24:13,702
The place on the right has a nice night view.

2412
01:24:13,802 --> 01:24:14,962
I see.

2413
01:24:15,062 --> 01:24:17,201
- It does have a nice view.
- It's so pretty.

2414
01:24:17,202 --> 01:24:19,271
- It looks great.
- With the wind...

2415
01:24:19,272 --> 01:24:21,801
- and the mist... Are they clouds?
- My goodness.

2416
01:24:21,802 --> 01:24:23,971
- It looks even better this way.
- It's so cool.

2417
01:24:23,972 --> 01:24:26,482
- Are we above the clouds?
- My gosh.

2418
01:24:27,182 --> 01:24:29,352
We can see the panoramic view of the city.

2419
01:24:29,382 --> 01:24:30,952
I can't capture it in a picture.

2420
01:24:31,052 --> 01:24:33,181
It is washed away with the wind, right?

2421
01:24:33,182 --> 01:24:34,921
Yes. Hey, look at that.

2422
01:24:34,922 --> 01:24:36,251
- Look at the vapor coming up.
- What?

2423
01:24:36,252 --> 01:24:38,351
- I think it's breaking.
- Look over there.

2424
01:24:38,352 --> 01:24:39,491
Look at that.

2425
01:24:39,492 --> 01:24:40,561
- My goodness.
- This is amazing.

2426
01:24:40,562 --> 01:24:42,332
Don't you think it feels like this?

2427
01:24:42,532 --> 01:24:43,792
Doesn't it feel like this?

2428
01:24:45,132 --> 01:24:47,861
"It's the perfect day to die."

2429
01:24:47,862 --> 01:24:49,372
Doesn't it feel like that?

2430
01:24:50,032 --> 01:24:51,431
- This place is so lovely.
- It's a little strange.

2431
01:24:51,432 --> 01:24:53,602
- It's somewhat noir-like.
- No, it feels like...

2432
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,671
- someone is spraying a huge mist.
- Come here.

2433
01:24:55,672 --> 01:24:58,012
One, two, three.

2434
01:24:58,542 --> 01:24:59,841
(The seventh Ribbon Spot, the night view of Mount Nam)

2435
01:24:59,842 --> 01:25:01,242
- It looks good.
- Nice.

2436
01:25:01,682 --> 01:25:03,011
- It's pretty.
- Yes. It looks good.

2437
01:25:03,012 --> 01:25:04,012
We look nice.

2438
01:25:04,352 --> 01:25:05,652
Everyone, finally,

2439
01:25:06,582 --> 01:25:08,992
this is the last spot of One Night Ribbon Trip in Seoul.

2440
01:25:09,252 --> 01:25:11,291
It's Seoul's representative landmark,

2441
01:25:11,292 --> 01:25:13,461
- N Seoul Tower.
- This is my first time here.

2442
01:25:13,462 --> 01:25:14,521
- It's lovely.
- Yes.

2443
01:25:14,522 --> 01:25:15,831
- Is it your first time here?
- Yes.

2444
01:25:15,832 --> 01:25:17,331
Do you know that the color changes?

2445
01:25:17,332 --> 01:25:19,031
- The color of the tower.
- About the fine dust?

2446
01:25:19,032 --> 01:25:21,262
- Exactly.
- Yes. The air is clean now.

2447
01:25:21,432 --> 01:25:22,531
(Good, fair, bad, very bad)

2448
01:25:22,532 --> 01:25:24,892
(The color of the tower indicates the levels of fine dust.)

2449
01:25:25,502 --> 01:25:27,771
(Today's fine dust level is good.)

2450
01:25:27,772 --> 01:25:30,311
This place has always been popular for its night views,

2451
01:25:30,312 --> 01:25:32,511
- It's pretty.
- but it's become more famous...

2452
01:25:32,512 --> 01:25:35,141
as a mecca for "KPop Demon Hunters."

2453
01:25:35,142 --> 01:25:36,382
Really?

2454
01:25:36,782 --> 01:25:38,251
(Taking photos at the N Seoul Tower, the place in "KPop Demon Hunters")

2455
01:25:38,252 --> 01:25:39,721
(With the popularity of "KPop Demon Hunters,")

2456
01:25:39,722 --> 01:25:41,798
(3,000 people of US companies came to Seoul to see the N Seoul Tower.)

2457
01:25:41,822 --> 01:25:44,192
So we prepared this game for Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

2458
01:25:44,692 --> 01:25:45,921
Where to sleep will be important, right?

2459
01:25:45,922 --> 01:25:47,322
Are we sleeping here? No way.

2460
01:25:47,422 --> 01:25:49,261
- But it's raining.
- Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

2461
01:25:49,262 --> 01:25:50,331
If we sleep here, we will have a stroke.

2462
01:25:50,332 --> 01:25:52,102
It's called Indoor Sleeping Hunters.

2463
01:25:52,832 --> 01:25:54,061
- I must win.
- ISH.

2464
01:25:54,062 --> 01:25:55,101
ISH.

2465
01:25:55,102 --> 01:25:56,931
- You know Saja Boys, right?
- Yes.

2466
01:25:56,932 --> 01:25:58,101
I don't know. I didn't watch it.

2467
01:25:58,102 --> 01:25:59,272
I didn't watch it.

2468
01:25:59,702 --> 01:26:01,342
I should watch the video clip.

2469
01:26:02,542 --> 01:26:05,882
(Saja Boys from "KPop Demon Hunters")

2470
01:26:05,982 --> 01:26:08,281
Is Saja Boys the messengers of death?

2471
01:26:08,282 --> 01:26:09,712
- Should we get one each?
- Yes.

2472
01:26:09,882 --> 01:26:11,052
The messengers of death?

2473
01:26:11,352 --> 01:26:12,682
- That's right.
- I see.

2474
01:26:13,052 --> 01:26:15,322
Are they taking us to the place where we will sleep?

2475
01:26:17,622 --> 01:26:21,162
(Turning into 1 Night Boys)

2476
01:26:22,392 --> 01:26:24,192
(Glancing)

2477
01:26:24,332 --> 01:26:26,831
You look like a person who'd hang out...

2478
01:26:26,832 --> 01:26:28,702
at a tavern a lot.

2479
01:26:29,772 --> 01:26:31,501
It looks like you'd go to a tavern a lot.

2480
01:26:31,502 --> 01:26:33,218
(It looks like he'd spend every day hammered.)

2481
01:26:33,242 --> 01:26:36,141
You've been on teams of three so far.

2482
01:26:36,142 --> 01:26:37,142
- Yes.
- Yes.

2483
01:26:37,172 --> 01:26:38,271
But, from now on...

2484
01:26:38,272 --> 01:26:39,341
- Is it an individual game?
- It's an individual game.

2485
01:26:39,342 --> 01:26:41,682
I hate it. I always lose in an individual game.

2486
01:26:42,182 --> 01:26:44,082
Yes! It's an individual game.

2487
01:26:45,012 --> 01:26:47,282
All right. There will be three rounds.

2488
01:26:47,782 --> 01:26:50,291
It is to determine three members to sleep outdoors.

2489
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:51,451
(There will be 3 members to sleep outdoors.)

2490
01:26:51,452 --> 01:26:53,592
The three members who survive until the end...

2491
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,061
will sleep indoors.

2492
01:26:55,062 --> 01:26:57,332
Where would it be the place for sleeping indoors?

2493
01:26:57,762 --> 01:27:00,062
- Are we going home?
- The place for sleeping indoors?

2494
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:01,362
It will be quite surprising.

2495
01:27:01,432 --> 01:27:03,401
There are only a few places like this in the world.

2496
01:27:03,402 --> 01:27:05,601
- What?
- It's something amazing.

2497
01:27:05,602 --> 01:27:07,418
- We have to win.
- What about sleeping outdoors?

2498
01:27:07,442 --> 01:27:08,801
- Sleeping outdoors?
- Here?

2499
01:27:08,802 --> 01:27:10,722
- Where are we going?
- It would be the outside.

2500
01:27:10,872 --> 01:27:13,141
- We will sleep in the rain.
- It will rain a lot tonight.

2501
01:27:13,142 --> 01:27:14,281
Is this okay?

2502
01:27:14,282 --> 01:27:17,052
(Where are they going to sleep tonight?)

2503
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:18,951
- I'll explain the rules.
- Okay.

2504
01:27:18,952 --> 01:27:21,722
- All right. This is Round One.
- Okay.

2505
01:27:21,882 --> 01:27:23,621
- It's Catch Boys.
- Catch Boys.

2506
01:27:23,622 --> 01:27:25,692
- Catch Boys.
- Catch Boys.

2507
01:27:25,822 --> 01:27:28,592
It is like playing tag in the pavilion.

2508
01:27:28,692 --> 01:27:31,662
One tagger will sit in the tagger zone in the center.

2509
01:27:31,832 --> 01:27:35,362
The rest of the members will sit on their respective benches.

2510
01:27:35,462 --> 01:27:37,302
- Then you'll start playing tag.
- Okay.

2511
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,942
Once I blow the whistle,

2512
01:27:39,102 --> 01:27:41,241
all the members on the benches must stand up...

2513
01:27:41,242 --> 01:27:43,611
and move to another bench right away.

2514
01:27:43,612 --> 01:27:46,181
The tagger must catch a member who is standing up.

2515
01:27:46,182 --> 01:27:47,641
It's important not to overlap.

2516
01:27:47,642 --> 01:27:50,311
That's right. You will take turns to play tag like that.

2517
01:27:50,312 --> 01:27:52,052
Once you're caught, you're the tagger.

2518
01:27:52,252 --> 01:27:55,351
But there's one more rule.

2519
01:27:55,352 --> 01:27:56,821
- Rule?
- Once you begin,

2520
01:27:56,822 --> 01:27:59,922
- we will set an alarm randomly.
- Okay.

2521
01:28:00,422 --> 01:28:02,862
The person who is the tagger...

2522
01:28:03,162 --> 01:28:05,532
when the alarm goes off is eliminated.

2523
01:28:06,132 --> 01:28:07,601
- We don't know when it goes off.
- Do you understand?

2524
01:28:07,602 --> 01:28:09,131
- I get it.
- We won't tell you.

2525
01:28:09,132 --> 01:28:10,801
- We never know.
- Okay. It's like the chair game.

2526
01:28:10,802 --> 01:28:12,901
- We should just avoid the tagger.
- Right.

2527
01:28:12,902 --> 01:28:13,902
Keep tagging others.

2528
01:28:13,903 --> 01:28:15,841
- For your information, - You look confident today.

2529
01:28:15,842 --> 01:28:16,871
Only one person can sit on each bench.

2530
01:28:16,872 --> 01:28:17,872
- Okay.
- Okay.

2531
01:28:17,873 --> 01:28:21,111
And you can't sit on the same bench consecutively.

2532
01:28:21,112 --> 01:28:22,352
Okay.

2533
01:28:22,552 --> 01:28:24,312
Should we pick the tagger then?

2534
01:28:24,512 --> 01:28:26,082
I think you have a die.

2535
01:28:27,282 --> 01:28:28,521
Let's go with the number right away.

2536
01:28:28,522 --> 01:28:29,651
(The die Director Joo throws will determine the tagger.)

2537
01:28:29,652 --> 01:28:31,422
- Leave it.
- Don't touch it.

2538
01:28:32,692 --> 01:28:34,892
- Seon Ho.
- It's Joon.

2539
01:28:34,992 --> 01:28:37,091
- It's Joon.
- It's okay to be the tagger first.

2540
01:28:37,092 --> 01:28:38,692
- Okay.
- That's right.

2541
01:28:38,832 --> 01:28:41,062
I think the alarm will go off in three minutes.

2542
01:28:41,302 --> 01:28:43,022
- All right.
- Or 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

2543
01:28:43,172 --> 01:28:44,272
That's about it.

2544
01:28:45,432 --> 01:28:47,001
I should sit for two minutes.

2545
01:28:47,002 --> 01:28:48,142
(He has a good hunch.)

2546
01:28:48,372 --> 01:28:49,372
Hey.

2547
01:28:49,373 --> 01:28:51,312
(Rotate in one direction.)

2548
01:28:51,972 --> 01:28:53,242
I think...

2549
01:28:54,612 --> 01:28:55,751
Joon.

2550
01:28:55,752 --> 01:28:58,272
(The members on the benches agreed to rotate in one direction.)

2551
01:28:59,182 --> 01:29:01,922
(The tagger starts to warm up.)

2552
01:29:06,122 --> 01:29:07,721
- You're good.
- Korean traditional dance.

2553
01:29:07,722 --> 01:29:09,961
- There you go.
- A genius dancer.

2554
01:29:09,962 --> 01:29:11,162
There you go.

2555
01:29:11,332 --> 01:29:13,232
(You're good.)

2556
01:29:13,302 --> 01:29:14,402
Make a turn.

2557
01:29:14,802 --> 01:29:17,832
(This is the dance move of a dance major.)

2558
01:29:19,442 --> 01:29:20,801
- All right.
- Once I blow the whistle.

2559
01:29:20,802 --> 01:29:21,901
- Okay.
- All right.

2560
01:29:21,902 --> 01:29:23,541
Hey, I'll go to your bench.

2561
01:29:23,542 --> 01:29:25,312
(Let's sleep indoors!)

2562
01:29:25,472 --> 01:29:26,942
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

2563
01:29:27,482 --> 01:29:28,612
Ready.

2564
01:29:29,182 --> 01:29:31,412
- No.
- Start.

2565
01:29:32,922 --> 01:29:34,121
(They forget all about the plan and move around hurriedly.)

2566
01:29:34,122 --> 01:29:35,252
He's staying still.

2567
01:29:36,922 --> 01:29:37,951
(Joon is waiting for the right time.)

2568
01:29:37,952 --> 01:29:39,192
All right.

2569
01:29:41,322 --> 01:29:43,592
(Move over!)

2570
01:29:43,632 --> 01:29:44,731
(Jong Min's camera)

2571
01:29:44,732 --> 01:29:46,661
(Jong Min has nowhere to go.)

2572
01:29:46,662 --> 01:29:49,172
- Joon, catch him.
- What?

2573
01:29:49,932 --> 01:29:52,402
(He has no intention of catching him at all.)

2574
01:29:53,442 --> 01:29:55,942
(In the meantime, Jong Min managed to sit down.)

2575
01:29:57,372 --> 01:29:58,372
(Joon is waiting for an opportunity to finish it in one go.)

2576
01:29:58,373 --> 01:30:00,611
- Why is he being like this?
- What's with him?

2577
01:30:00,612 --> 01:30:02,482
- I'm just reading the room.
- All right.

2578
01:30:04,812 --> 01:30:06,281
(When is he going to catch?)

2579
01:30:06,282 --> 01:30:08,622
- Why...
- All right.

2580
01:30:08,682 --> 01:30:09,822
I'm so tired.

2581
01:30:10,952 --> 01:30:12,922
(He finally starts tagging?)

2582
01:30:14,022 --> 01:30:15,992
- I didn't tag him on purpose.
- All right.

2583
01:30:16,332 --> 01:30:17,661
We still have time.

2584
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:18,761
(Relaxed)

2585
01:30:18,762 --> 01:30:20,032
All right.

2586
01:30:20,102 --> 01:30:21,632
(Switch seats with me.)

2587
01:30:22,502 --> 01:30:24,431
(To avoid being caught, they have to minimize the distance they move.)

2588
01:30:24,432 --> 01:30:25,632
We're tired now.

2589
01:30:32,142 --> 01:30:33,142
(The benches on both sides are occupied.)

2590
01:30:33,143 --> 01:30:34,642
You have to tag him now.

2591
01:30:34,882 --> 01:30:36,411
He can't sit there.

2592
01:30:36,412 --> 01:30:37,712
He can't sit there.

2593
01:30:37,852 --> 01:30:40,122
Just come and sit.

2594
01:30:40,822 --> 01:30:42,322
- Take a seat.
- He can't sit there.

2595
01:30:42,822 --> 01:30:44,421
- He can't...
- I promise I won't tag you.

2596
01:30:44,422 --> 01:30:46,222
- I'll let you go this time. Go on.
- Really?

2597
01:30:46,422 --> 01:30:47,821
- Why would you let him go?
- Hey, tag someone now.

2598
01:30:47,822 --> 01:30:49,761
I'm really tired. Go ahead and tag me.

2599
01:30:49,762 --> 01:30:51,432
- My strategy...
- All right.

2600
01:30:51,662 --> 01:30:53,102
Has not begun yet.

2601
01:30:54,762 --> 01:30:56,001
(Switch with me.)

2602
01:30:56,002 --> 01:30:57,772
- Switch with me.
- All right.

2603
01:30:57,802 --> 01:30:58,871
All right.

2604
01:30:58,872 --> 01:31:02,172
(If they switch seats, they can save energy and time.)

2605
01:31:02,812 --> 01:31:05,012
(They've figured out the winning strategy.)

2606
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:10,482
(DinDin and Seon Ho have been doing it from the start.)

2607
01:31:11,212 --> 01:31:14,052
(It's been 1 minute already.)

2608
01:31:15,082 --> 01:31:16,121
All right.

2609
01:31:16,122 --> 01:31:18,452
(Shall I begin now?)

2610
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,821
(Cho Sae Ho is tagged in 1 second.)

2611
01:31:21,822 --> 01:31:23,161
- What? Is it me?
- You should switch.

2612
01:31:23,162 --> 01:31:24,661
- Give me that.
- Switch the taggers.

2613
01:31:24,662 --> 01:31:26,238
Once he sits down, it begins right away.

2614
01:31:26,262 --> 01:31:27,432
All right.

2615
01:31:31,502 --> 01:31:33,342
(Missed)

2616
01:31:35,202 --> 01:31:36,871
(Tagged)

2617
01:31:36,872 --> 01:31:38,241
(Sae Ho's camera)

2618
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:40,542
(He's after only one person, Moon Se Yoon.)

2619
01:31:41,182 --> 01:31:43,352
(The tagger is switched from Sae Ho to Se Yoon.)

2620
01:31:44,252 --> 01:31:46,252
(He tagged Seon Ho quickly.)

2621
01:31:46,722 --> 01:31:49,082
(The Moom-Din alliance is formed.)

2622
01:31:49,552 --> 01:31:51,591
(Hurry!)

2623
01:31:51,592 --> 01:31:52,721
All right.

2624
01:31:52,722 --> 01:31:54,321
(Target)

2625
01:31:54,322 --> 01:31:56,792
(Cho Sae Ho)

2626
01:31:58,032 --> 01:31:59,032
What?

2627
01:31:59,033 --> 01:32:01,138
(They switch taggers quickly, fearing the alarm will go off.)

2628
01:32:01,162 --> 01:32:02,301
I'm so tired.

2629
01:32:02,302 --> 01:32:03,831
- Are you okay?
- Let the alarm go off.

2630
01:32:03,832 --> 01:32:04,902
All right.

2631
01:32:05,032 --> 01:32:06,801
Stay in the square. All right.

2632
01:32:06,802 --> 01:32:07,922
(Who's Sae Ho's target now?)

2633
01:32:09,212 --> 01:32:11,112
(Only Moon Se Yoon)

2634
01:32:12,042 --> 01:32:14,082
(Why does he tag only me?)

2635
01:32:15,542 --> 01:32:17,281
- I sat down.
- No, I tagged you first.

2636
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:18,651
- I sat.
- Did he really sit first?

2637
01:32:18,652 --> 01:32:20,152
- You were tagged.
- You were tagged.

2638
01:32:20,852 --> 01:32:22,021
Why only me?

2639
01:32:22,022 --> 01:32:23,892
- Make it quick.
- Hurry and sit.

2640
01:32:24,152 --> 01:32:25,221
All right.

2641
01:32:25,222 --> 01:32:26,962
(They have about 40 seconds left.)

2642
01:32:27,862 --> 01:32:29,832
(Missed)

2643
01:32:30,332 --> 01:32:32,032
(Why does it have to be me?)

2644
01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:35,231
(Jong Min is the tagger.)

2645
01:32:35,232 --> 01:32:36,302
I tagged you.

2646
01:32:37,172 --> 01:32:39,442
(There is not much time left.)

2647
01:32:40,372 --> 01:32:43,442
(The one who's tagged this time will be sleeping outdoors.)

2648
01:32:43,512 --> 01:32:44,842
All right.

2649
01:32:46,142 --> 01:32:47,142
Okay.

2650
01:32:47,842 --> 01:32:49,251
(As soon as the whistle blew, Seon Ho got tagged.)

2651
01:32:49,252 --> 01:32:50,781
- Seon Ho.
- Hurry.

2652
01:32:50,782 --> 01:32:51,982
- All right.
- Here.

2653
01:32:52,582 --> 01:32:53,621
(The alarm goes off as soon as he's tagged.)

2654
01:32:53,622 --> 01:32:56,792
- Okay!
- He's out! Okay!

2655
01:32:57,322 --> 01:32:59,122
(Dancing happily)

2656
01:33:00,592 --> 01:33:03,932
(The survivors celebrate with a dance.)

2657
01:33:07,662 --> 01:33:09,331
- Okay. It's done.
- Okay!

2658
01:33:09,332 --> 01:33:12,171
- It's done. Okay.
- Okay.

2659
01:33:12,172 --> 01:33:13,701
- I want to play again!
- This is madness.

2660
01:33:13,702 --> 01:33:15,071
- I'm exhausted.
- I'm so tired.

2661
01:33:15,072 --> 01:33:17,212
- That was exhausting.
- I'm drained.

2662
01:33:17,272 --> 01:33:19,381
- It was nerve-racking.
- Seriously.

2663
01:33:19,382 --> 01:33:20,581
I managed to get away,

2664
01:33:20,582 --> 01:33:22,358
- It was nerve-racking.
- but I got caught at the end.

2665
01:33:22,382 --> 01:33:24,082
All this after eating pork cutlet?

2666
01:33:24,912 --> 01:33:27,722
- I'm exhausted.
- Eat and digest, eat and digest.

2667
01:33:28,252 --> 01:33:30,122
(Next episode)

2668
01:33:30,422 --> 01:33:32,052
(D-2 to filming)

2669
01:33:32,592 --> 01:33:34,662
(Director Joo calls the members)

2670
01:33:34,822 --> 01:33:36,091
Have you been well?

2671
01:33:36,092 --> 01:33:38,092
(Why a sudden video call?)

2672
01:33:38,662 --> 01:33:40,702
(Two of these people...)

2673
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:42,431
(will not go on a 2 day 1 night trip.)

2674
01:33:42,432 --> 01:33:44,532
(They'll go on a 3 day 2 night trip.)

2675
01:33:44,772 --> 01:33:46,272
(We must leave tomorrow?)

2676
01:33:46,372 --> 01:33:48,272
(That's not at all like the title!)

2677
01:33:48,572 --> 01:33:50,572
(A sudden travel game begins.)

2678
01:33:51,272 --> 01:33:53,342
(Who must pack immediately?)

2679
01:33:54,742 --> 01:33:56,852
(The lucky winners arrive somewhere.)

2680
01:33:57,352 --> 01:33:58,712
(Isn't this a penalty?)

2681
01:33:58,782 --> 01:34:00,522
(They gathered on Thursday night at 9pm.)

2682
01:34:00,652 --> 01:34:02,052
(Who are...)

2683
01:34:02,952 --> 01:34:05,592
(the special guests of this special trip?)

2684
01:34:06,792 --> 01:34:09,832
(See you on Sunday night at 6:10pm.)
