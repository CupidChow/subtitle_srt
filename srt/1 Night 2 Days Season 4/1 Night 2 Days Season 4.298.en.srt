(and the refreshing forests.)

00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:30,477
(Dokdo protector Professor Seo Kyoung Duk)

11
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:34,287
(October 25 is Dokdo Day.)

12
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:35,886
(2 Days 1 Night...)

13
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:38,987
(goes to Dokdo.)

14
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:40,557
- Yes.
- For real?

(The furthest point east of the Korean territory)

16
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:45,827

(It'll be a close match between Jong Min and DinDin.)

20
00:00:56,937 --> 00:00:58,906
(DinDin takes the lead.)

21
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:00,946
(So does Jong Min.)

22
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:02,917
(They're both correct.)

(Who will win the unpredictable quiz?)

24

(2 Days 1 Night)

25
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:12,086
- Okay.
- Number four.

26
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:13,656
- It's number 4 already?
- The 4th question.

27
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:14,826
Okay?

28
00:01:14,827 --> 00:01:16,656
- Please.
- During King Sukjong's reign.

29
00:01:16,657 --> 00:01:17,727
Oh, dear.

30
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:20,897
This person went to Japan twice...

31
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:23,597
and got confirmation of the Japanese government...

32
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:26,606
that Dokdo belonged to us.

33
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:28,406
I heard all of this before.

34
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:30,337
The name of this man.

35
00:01:31,337 --> 00:01:33,076
- What is it?
- Shall we end this?

36
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:35,146
- Answer it and stay out.
- Answer and stay out.

37
00:01:35,147 --> 00:01:36,176
If you get two right...

38
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:37,676
- Answer and go outside.
- Okay.

39
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:38,746
- What?
- Wait outside.

40
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:39,916
That's a good idea.

41
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,586
Get it right and go outside.

42
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:44,157
The name of that man is...

43
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:45,857
An Yong Bok.

44
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:47,926
Applause.

45
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:49,026
(Well done, Dokdo DinDin.)

46
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:50,197
That's right.

47
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:51,557
My gosh.

48
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:53,026
He deserves the applause.

49
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:54,297
Seriously, DinDin...

50
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:57,066
(Japanese fishermen illegally crossed the border...)

51
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,167
(to fish near Ulleung Island.)

52
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:02,576
He was a commoner,

53
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:06,407
but he disguised himself as a magistrate...

54
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:07,646
and told them off.

55
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:10,146
He then got confirmation that the territory was ours.

56
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:13,046
- Gosh.
- Your image is improving.

57
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:14,346
Such knowledge...

58
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:15,986
Did you study while writing the lyrics?

59
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:18,116
(Japan's report on An Yong Bok from that time...)

60
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:20,156
(states Gangwon Province owns Ulleung Island and Dokdo.)

61
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:22,397
Because of what An Yong Bok did,

62
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:24,256
Joseon's government...

63
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:26,727
becomes greatly interested in...

64
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:28,766
proclaiming their territory...

65
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:32,567
and maintaining fishing boundaries.

66
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:37,577
They also increase inspection around Ulleung Island.

67
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:43,246
I think it's very important that he brought about that change.

68
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,387
We mentioned two people related to Dokdo.

69
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:47,946
Yisabu and An Yong Bok.

70
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:49,117
- Yes.
- Yes.

71
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:51,686
Dokdo is our territory,

72
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:53,086
- so there's a Korean address.
- Yes.

73
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:55,857
There are roads that include...

74
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:58,396
- their names.
- The names are there.

75
00:02:58,397 --> 00:03:00,517
(To honor their memory, roads were named after them.)

76
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,597
Well done, DinDin.

77
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:04,566
I acknowledge you. You can take over.

78
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:05,567
Thank you.

79
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:07,107
Good for you, DinDin.

80
00:03:07,607 --> 00:03:08,736
- Gosh.
- DinDin.

81
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:10,676
- He won some squid and pork belly.
- Yes.

82
00:03:10,677 --> 00:03:12,377
He's guaranteed a portion.

83
00:03:12,507 --> 00:03:14,146
- There are two spots left.
- Two spots left.

84
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:17,717
I'll give you the fifth question.

85
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:20,186
There are many heritage records...

86
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:23,016
that state Dokdo is our territory.

87
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:24,116
I know this one.

88
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:25,757
You must name one of them.

89
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:30,257
This record says the following about Dokdo.

90
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:34,796
(The two islands, Usan and Murung, lie close to each other.)

91
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,296
(On clear days, they can be seen from afar.)

92
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:41,137
This book was written in the early Joseon era.

93
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,377
What is it called?

94
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:45,757
Jong Min, get it right and sit it out.

95
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:48,147
So the rest can fight like dogs.

96
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,116
- What?
- You answer.

97
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:52,047
This is... Isn't it easy?

98
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:55,587
(This is easy?)

99
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:58,217
I mentioned a hint earlier.

100
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:00,387
"Dokdo Is Our Land."

101
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:02,456
- Think of the song.
- I know that.

102
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:03,957
Play it in your mind.

103
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:06,567
(Something-something third line)

104
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:09,166
You know the part I mean.

105
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,597
And then the fourth line.

106
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,607
(Thinking hard)

107
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:16,637
(It's this, isn't it?)

108
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,777
(DinDin's correct.)

109
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:22,246
(The answer DinDin wrote)

110
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:24,447
("The Veritable Records of King Sejong")

111
00:04:24,577 --> 00:04:27,487
- Okay, so...
- The Veritable Records.

112
00:04:28,187 --> 00:04:29,616
(As if he received a revelation, )

113
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:30,956
(Jong Min remembered a few words.)

114
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:34,687
The book's title includes the syllable "se."

115
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:35,996
- Jong Min!
- Me!

116
00:04:35,997 --> 00:04:37,057
Okay.

117
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:38,396
- It's Jong Min.
- It's over.

118
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:39,666
You can sit it out too.

119
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:40,726
- I'll get this one.
- Okay.

120
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:42,366
- I was confused for a bit.
- I see.

121
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,996
"The Veritable Records of King Sejong."

122
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:45,636
- Yes, that.
- Oh.

123
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:46,837
Give him some applause.

124
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:49,577
- I've heard it from somewhere.
- I had to think.

125
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:52,276
What do the song lyrics say?

126
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:54,197
- "The Veritable Records..."
- "Of King Sejong."

127
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:55,917
Page 50... What was it?

128
00:04:57,347 --> 00:05:00,146
(The lyrics Jong Min knows)

129
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:02,186
(The Veritable Records of King Sejong)

130
00:05:02,187 --> 00:05:04,086
(Page 50, line 3)

131
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:07,356
The lyrics have since changed.

132
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:08,926
"The Veritable Records of King Sejong,"

133
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:11,326
"Gangwon Province, Uljin-hyeon."

134
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:12,727
Those are the new words.

135
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:15,497
That part has changed. That's why I was confused.

136
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:17,836
(Lyric change)

137
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:19,636
(87K, Ulleung-eup Dokdo-ri)

138
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:23,336
(Average temperature 13°C, rainfall 1,800)

139
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:25,236
(Cod, mussel, barnacles, Choi Jong Deok, Kim Seong Do)

140
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,006
(19,000m², 799 and 805, Gangwon Province, Uljin-hyeon, Joseon land)

141
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:28,806
(Hawaii belongs to the US, Daema Island belongs to Joseon)

142
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:30,646
(Dokdo is our land)

143
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:32,327
Here's one more thing everyone might know.

144
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:34,947
Have you heard of the Map of the Eight Provinces?

145
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:36,116
- The Map of the Eight Provinces?
- Yes.

146
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,917
- No one seems to know that.
- Right.

147
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,586
- No one seems to know what it is.
- What a surprise.

148
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:40,926
- That's quite a bold name.
- The Map of the Eight Provinces.

149
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:42,286
- That's what it's called.
- I love that ramyeon brand.

150
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:44,127
It was the early years of the Joseon Era.

151
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,467
The map marked Ulleung Island and Dokdo.

152
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:51,867
But unfortunately, the places of the island switched.

153
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,637
But that's not so important...

154
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,876
because it clearly proves that during the Joseon Era,

155
00:05:56,877 --> 00:05:59,476
we were already aware of those two islands.

156
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:00,846
- Right. We were.
- That's what's important.

157
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:03,047
- We know their locations.
- Indeed.

158
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:05,646
I just told you about the two records...

159
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:08,417
our country established. Right?

160
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:11,587
Then there were also records from Japan.

161
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:15,387
Those records confirmed that Dokdo indeed belonged to our country.

162
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:17,126
- Right.
- There were two records.

163
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,267
- Yes, I heard about them.
- They're quite important.

164
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:22,067
It's called the Dajokan Order.

165
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:24,166
Dajokan referred to a government office.

166
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,967
Nowadays, it'd be equivalent to the Prime Minister's Office.

167
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:28,566
That's of the same importance.

168
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,137
The document verified that...

169
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:33,347
Ulleung Island and Dokdo...

170
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:36,116
had no ties to Japan.

171
00:06:36,117 --> 00:06:37,716
(Note that Ulleung Island and Dokdo had no ties to Japan.)

172
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:41,946
They drew up an official document that confirmed this.

173
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:43,716
(It's an official document Japan voluntarily acknowledged...)

174
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:45,793
(that Ulleung Island and Dokdo were not part of its territory.)

175
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:46,886
The Dajokan Order that I just went over...

176
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:47,956
- was one of the records.
- Yes.

177
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,596
Then there was another one. It's called...

178
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:51,156
the Map of the Three Countries' Adjacent Territories.

179
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:52,356
- I don't know about this.
- Yes.

180
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:53,866
- That's what it's called.
- It's a map.

181
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:55,866
A Japanese geographer...

182
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:59,366
drew up a map that showed the borders...

183
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:02,537
- around Japan.
- Yes.

184
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:06,876
- He colored Joseon in yellow.
- I see. He colored it.

185
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:08,176
- He colored it.
- Yes.

186
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,217
Then he clearly drew Ulleung Island...

187
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:13,187
- and Dokdo.
- Did he color them in yellow?

188
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:15,617
Then he colored them in yellow.

189
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:18,517
Do you know what it said next to Ulleung Island?

190
00:07:18,657 --> 00:07:20,127
"Joseon's island."

191
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,426
- Really?
- Yes.

192
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:24,457
- He wrote that clearly?
- Yes.

193
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,896
- They had acknowledged it...
- It's game over then.

194
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:29,017
- in the past. Yes.
- They already marked it as ours.

195
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:31,366
- This should be available online.
- All right.

196
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,637
This is frustrating, isn't it? All right.

197
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:37,076
- Seon Ho, your eyes are gleaming.
- Right now... Yes.

198
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:39,076
- Now...
- All right. Great.

199
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:40,797
- Everyone.
- What was the name of the map?

200
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,246
The Map of the Three Countries' Adjacent Territories.

201
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:43,716
- Correct.
- My gosh. Great.

202
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:45,777
- That was... Right.
- What was the first document?

203
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:47,416
The Dajokan Order.

204
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,986
You know what? I'll give him a point.

205
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:51,286
- What?
- Yes.

206
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:52,386
- He told us just now.
- No.

207
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:54,926
It's not easy to memorize both documents together.

208
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:56,256
- Give him a point.
- Yes.

209
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:57,356
- For your information...
- Sir.

210
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,156
- Yes.
- You're the best.

211
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:00,726
(You're the best, Professor.)

212
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:01,926
(The score status of the FUDE)

213
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:04,637
(Jong Min and DinDin won the seasoned squid and pork belly.)

214
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,637
We're already at Question Six.

215
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,936
- It's our sixth question.
- This is the last question.

216
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:09,206
- Seon Ho will win with 1 more.
- It's Question 6.

217
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:11,676
- We have two more questions left.
- If Seon Ho gets it, it's over.

218
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:12,846
There's only one spot left.

219
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:15,107
This was issued for the 1st time in 1954.

220
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:18,077
Back then, the Japanese media regulated it...

221
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:20,646
- Come again? Violence?
- as an act of violence.

222
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:21,716
It stirred up a huge controversy.

223
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,617
- An act of violence.
- I see.

224
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:27,387
In the end, it was covered up with black ink.

225
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:31,857
Afterward in 2002 and 2004,

226
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:33,867
it was issued two more times.

227
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:36,367
Through this, it was once again confirmed...

228
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:39,196
on an international scale that Dokdo belonged to Korea.

229
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:40,206
- Sae Ho.
- Yes.

230
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:41,237
Stamps.

231
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:44,477
He got it. It's over.

232
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:46,406
- It's over.
- Stamps.

233
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:47,507
What kind of stamp?

234
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:50,146
What? What do you mean?

235
00:08:50,147 --> 00:08:51,716
- What?
- What's this?

236
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:53,416
- I mean...
- What kind of stamp?

237
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:54,846
- What kind of stamp?
- Right.

238
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:56,157
Why are you doing this to me?

239
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:57,856
Sae Ho, it has four syllables.

240
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:58,987
Dokdo Stamp.

241
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:00,527
- Correct.
- Okay.

242
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:01,827
Yes.

243
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,727
(Obtaining 1 point)

244
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,297
Let me tell you about the stamps.

245
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,766
In 1954, the trio of Dokdo Stamps with the scenery of the island...

246
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,367
- was manufactured.
- I see.

247
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,276
In response to these stamps,

248
00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:18,076
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan declared...

249
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:20,807
they wouldn't accept any mails with the stamps.

250
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:25,017
According to the Universal Postal Union,

251
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:28,547
there's the freedom of transit in the Universal Postal Union.

252
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:31,186
Our mails with Dokdo Stamps...

253
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:33,127
- were delivered to Japan.
- I see.

254
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:35,687
But the Japanese government...

255
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:38,157
painted the stamps with black ink.

256
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:41,197
Then the mails were delivered to the recipients.

257
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:43,166
- Instead of returning the mails?
- I see. To cover them up.

258
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,236
- Yes.
- My gosh.

259
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:46,066
And there's one more thing we must note from this.

260
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:47,706
In 2004, we manufactured...

261
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:49,337
four different kinds of Dokdo Stamps...

262
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:53,107
with natural landscapes of Dokdo.

263
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:56,817
This garnered a lot of attention in both Korea and Japan.

264
00:09:56,947 --> 00:10:00,247
We got an immediate response from Japan.

265
00:10:00,387 --> 00:10:01,916
Here's how things escalated.

266
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,616
The far-right organization of Japan...

267
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:05,687
used boats to stage a protest at sea.

268
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:11,127
They even tried to come onshore on Dokdo.

269
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:14,897
What they did was just unheard of. A crazy incident like that occurred.

270
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:18,997
(The history of stamps that proved the sovereign authority of Dokdo)

271
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:22,236
(They weren't just simple stamps.)

272
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:24,636
(The stamps were a declaration of Dokdo's sovereignty.)

273
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:28,347
I'll come clean about the seventh question.

274
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:29,816
I also learned about this...

275
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:31,046
- while preparing for the show.
- Really?

276
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,816
- Then how could we know about it?
- Gosh, it will be a headache.

277
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:34,287
- Can I participate then?
- Right.

278
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:36,756
- Here's the question.
- Here it is.

279
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:38,586
- Okay. It's the 7th question.
- The 7th question.

280
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:41,126
It's the song all Koreans know.

281
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:43,327
I kept telling you to remember the lyrics.

282
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:45,997
It's "Dokdo Is Our Land."

283
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:47,596
The song was written...

284
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:50,037
by a KBS director, Park Moon Young.

285
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:51,296
- I see.
- Okay.

286
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:54,037
But the show where the song was introduced...

287
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:57,677
for the first time has a unique title.

288
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:00,977
- I knew the answer before.
- Okay.

289
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,506
- What's the title...
- I forgot, though.

290
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:04,546
Of the TV show...

291
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:06,586
where "Dokdo Is Our Land" was released for the first time?

292
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:07,687
- Sae Ho.
- Yes.

293
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:09,387
"Humor No. 1."

294
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:11,686
- What did you say?
- "Humor No. 1."

295
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:13,007
- "Humor No. 1."
- "Humor No. 1."

296
00:11:13,057 --> 00:11:15,727
- But...
- It's such an old song.

297
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:17,226
- It is.
- Correct!

298
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:18,227
(Sae Ho answers it correctly.)

299
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:19,966
- Really?
- Jeong Kwang Tae sang the song.

300
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:21,596
- He used to be a comedian.
- That's right. Kwang Tae.

301
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,797
My guess was that he probably sang it during a segment.

302
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,607
- You're right. It was him.
- My gosh.

303
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:29,607
Gosh, he knew the history of comedy in Korea.

304
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:31,106
- Right.
- Sae Ho.

305
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,206
- I was right?
- Yes.

306
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:34,007
- I didn't know it'd be that.
- "Humor No. 1."

307
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,607
The show was funny.

308
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:37,346
- I didn't know.
- Director Park...

309
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:39,447
was working on "Humor No. 1" back then.

310
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:41,486
Then he read an article that...

311
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:45,017
Japan claimed that Dokdo was their territory.

312
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:49,497
He decided to write a song that claimed Dokdo as ours.

313
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:52,967
What happened next was really funny.

314
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:54,797
He was trying to produce the song.

315
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:57,337
They couldn't find a time when everyone was free.

316
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:59,506
- Only Kwang Tae...
- Kwang Tae recorded the song...

317
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:01,406
- alone.
- I see.

318
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,706
That's crazy.

319
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:05,807
(On stage, he sang the song alone.)

320
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:14,686
(But now, every Korean citizen sings it to the world.)

321
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:18,786
(No matter how much they claim it as their own)

322
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:21,926
(Dokdo is our land)

323
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:23,296
All right. Then Jong Min,

324
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:25,127
- Sae Ho, and I can eat dinner.
- My gosh.

325
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:27,966
- Congratulations.
- My gosh. That was great.

326
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,966
(Congratulations.)

327
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31,937
That was quite unique. What a fun quiz this was.

328
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:34,307
- Sae Ho got this right.
- So...

329
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:35,836
- This feels great.
- Yes.

330
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:37,177
(Agreeing)

331
00:12:38,977 --> 00:12:40,606
(The two islands, Usan and Murung, lie close to each other.)

332
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:42,306
(On clear days, they can be seen from afar.)

333
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:43,947
("The Veritable Records of King Sejong")

334
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:49,857
(Every historical evidence proves that Dokdo is our land.)

335
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:54,857
(Dokdo has always been our territory in thousands years of history.)

336
00:12:56,657 --> 00:13:01,367
(Dokdo will forever remain our island beyond time.)

337
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:04,196
The three of you can eat with the professor.

338
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:05,773
(The 3 winners will eat seasoned squid and pork belly with him.)

339
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:07,166
The rest of you will get some food.

340
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,166
You can all pick a meal each.

341
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,736
- I'll take mussel barnacle rice.
- Me too.

342
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,006
I'll take the Amur wallflower meal.

343
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:14,276
- I'll take mussel barnacle rice.
- The wallflower meal is tasty.

344
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:15,506
Two Amur wallflower meals.

345
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:17,987
Mussel barnacle rice for the rest. We'll serve you right away.

346
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:20,216
- That looks so good.
- Here you go.

347
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,217
Hello.

348
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:24,057
(The delicacy of Ulleung Island is brought in.)

349
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:26,556
(The local meal of Ulleung Island)

350
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,233
(A one-dish meal that utilizes local products of Ulleung Island)

351
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:29,726
The side dishes look tasty.

352
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,103
(It's served with 11 side dishes, enough to fill up a table.)

353
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:34,066
- The squid looks great.
- Yes.

354
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,266
Personally,

355
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:37,067
seasoned squid and pork belly is my favorite.

356
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:40,607
(Mussel barnacle rice, Amur wallflower rice)

357
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,466
The squid was caught this morning.

358
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:43,876
- This morning?
- This morning? Gosh.

359
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:45,437
- Is this seasoned goat's beard?
- Yes.

360
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:46,806
- That was tasty.
- It's good.

361
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:48,947
- We're getting side dishes too?
- Of course.

362
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:51,016
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

363
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:52,046
No way.

364
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:54,093
This is the most we've gotten on the show as losers.

365
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:55,816
- Right.
- Today...

366
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:57,756
- What a feast.
- It's a good day.

367
00:13:57,757 --> 00:13:59,086
Gosh, this looks good. It's a healthy meal.

368
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,256
- That startled me.
- My goodness.

369
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,257
(Butting in)

370
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,487
What was that?

371
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:04,233
Gosh, this looks good. It's a healthy meal.

372
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:06,396
(The camera ambushes the table of Team Losers.)

373
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:07,467
What was that?

374
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:09,126
(Flustered)

375
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:10,466
I thought you were going to take it away.

376
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:13,337
I'm not joking. I thought there was a dinosaur.

377
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:14,666
It came at us.

378
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,506
(Fascinated)

379
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:17,976
That was a shocking experience.

380
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:19,306
(A shocking camera angle since his debut)

381
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:21,147
- Great.
- The Amur wallflowers look tasty.

382
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:22,646
We have to add some soy sauce.

383
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:24,323
- Let's add some soy sauce.
- Yes. Add a bit.

384
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:26,227
(Drizzled with a dash of the special soy sauce)

385
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:28,116
(The representative delicacy, mussel barnacle rice, )

386
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,687
(is a collection of the ocean's gems.)

387
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:31,856
(It's nature in a bowl.)

388
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:33,903
(The Amur wallflower rice with a fresh, aromatic scent)

389
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:38,057
(We invite you to the world of new flavors.)

390
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:39,696
(The professor has a bite first.)

391
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:40,727
It's tasty.

392
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,426
(The flavor brings a smile.)

393
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:44,036
- My gosh.
- Have a bite first.

394
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:45,137
Gosh, it's tasty.

395
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,236
(Sae Ho has it with the victory onion.)

396
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,277
- The victory onion.
- Right. We have to try it.

397
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:53,053
I get why she told us to mix it with the victory onion.

398
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:55,207
It has a hint of bitterness. It tastes great.

399
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:56,977
It's so good.

400
00:14:57,477 --> 00:14:59,177
My gosh. The food here is so good.

401
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:01,886
Have some Amur wallflower rice. It's good.

402
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,057
(It's too good not to share.)

403
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:04,987
The food today is crazy.

404
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:07,827
You can only get a meal like this here.

405
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:09,727
Try the deodeok.

406
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:11,097
It's so good.

407
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:13,227
The vegetables are so good.

408
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:15,366
- It should be ready, right?
- Seriously.

409
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:17,267
- Right.
- I'll serve everyone now.

410
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:21,206
(It's packed with plump squids from Ulleung Island.)

411
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:23,436
- This is yours, Professor.
- Thank you.

412
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:24,837
I'll give you more.

413
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:26,776
I was actually curious about this dish.

414
00:15:26,777 --> 00:15:29,046
We can easily get this dish in Seoul too.

415
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:31,076
But whenever he comes here, he always gets...

416
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,646
- seasoned squid and pork belly.
- Yes.

417
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:34,546
- It's so good.
- He said the squid was different.

418
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:35,587
Right.

419
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:37,987
(He has a bite of his favorite dish.)

420
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:39,617
My gosh. The food here is so good.

421
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:41,486
(The spicy and chewy squid and pork belly...)

422
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:43,057
(blend into an amazing flavor.)

423
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:45,857
(It's like there's a live squid in his mouth.)

424
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:48,726
- The squid is indeed different.
- Isn't it good?

425
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:50,647
- The squid is different.
- It's nice and plump.

426
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:53,137
- The squid is so good.
- The squid is crazy.

427
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:54,506
- Liars.
- You must have them together.

428
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:55,706
Liars. Stop lying.

429
00:15:55,707 --> 00:15:57,007
- I'm serious.
- Really?

430
00:15:57,077 --> 00:15:58,206
Stop lying. I bet they're the same.

431
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,777
I bet it tastes like the one in Seoul.

432
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:03,746
When you eat it in Seoul, squid can be a bit tough.

433
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:04,917
But this one...

434
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:07,446
It's so easy to chew it.

435
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:09,087
- You're lying.
- I'm serious.

436
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:11,017
Hey, it can't be that different.

437
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:12,586
- Gosh, it smells amazing.
- My gosh.

438
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:13,987
(I just want a bite of this.)

439
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:16,226
(Feeling bad for them)

440
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:17,896
I prepared more questions.

441
00:16:17,897 --> 00:16:20,796
It's One Bite Quiz.

442
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:21,897
One Bite Quiz?

443
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,437
- Stop eating, Jong Min.
- What?

444
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:26,866
Why did you get more when he said there was a quiz?

445
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:27,867
Okay.

446
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:31,736
This isn't a difficult question.

447
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,606
- Okay.
- It's not hard.

448
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:34,877
Listen up.

449
00:16:35,747 --> 00:16:38,317
To stand up to Japan's encroachment on Dokdo,

450
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:41,446
the residents of Ulleung Island formed...

451
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:43,386
the Dokdo Volunteer Garrison.

452
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:45,016
(Dokdo Volunteer Garrison)

453
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:46,626
- You've all heard of it, right?
- Yes.

454
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:48,257
You all know about them, don't you?

455
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:51,757
Some people helped recover...

456
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:54,096
the bodies of deceased members...

457
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,797
of the organization who drowned in the ocean.

458
00:16:57,197 --> 00:16:58,867
Who are they?

459
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:02,937
They helped recover the bodies.

460
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:06,276
- They're people, right?
- Of course.

461
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:07,507
- Joon.
- Go ahead.

462
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:08,907
Haenyeos.

463
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:10,517
Really?

464
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:13,017
(Restless)

465
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:14,186
Wait.

466
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:15,907
- Haenyeos.
- This is what happened before.

467
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:17,156
- It has four syllables.
- Gosh.

468
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:18,516
- Seon Ho.
- Hey.

469
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:19,956
- We should let him answer first.
- Okay.

470
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,186
- You go 1st.
- It has 4 syllables.

471
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:23,656
- He must be partially correct.
- Then...

472
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:24,756
Cool haenyeos?

473
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:26,026
(Like Dokdo Stamps?)

474
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:27,297
- Then...
- Cool haenyeos?

475
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,097
(He didn't see this answer coming.)

476
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:34,266
(But he was quite close.)

477
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,636
- They're so cool. Right?
- Yes, they are cool indeed.

478
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:38,813
- But it's something else.
- The word before haenyeos...

479
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:40,276
is a name of another island.

480
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:41,407
- Seon Ho.
- My gosh.

481
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,617
- What?
- Seon Ho.

482
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:45,846
- Go ahead.
- Is this it? Jeju haenyeos.

483
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:47,286
(Jeju haenyeos)

484
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:48,916
- I guess he's right.
- Correct!

485
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,186
(Seon Ho gets it right.)

486
00:17:50,187 --> 00:17:51,616
They came from Jeju to help out?

487
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:52,957
- Yes.
- The haenyeos came?

488
00:17:53,187 --> 00:17:54,326
How...

489
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:55,756
(Even the Dokdo Scholar didn't know about this.)

490
00:17:55,757 --> 00:17:57,596
Back then in 1950s,

491
00:17:57,597 --> 00:18:00,126
haenyeos from Jeju came here...

492
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:03,126
and went underwater in order to make a living.

493
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:04,696
- They are cool indeed.
- They used to...

494
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:05,997
go underwater for food.

495
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:08,166
As I told you,

496
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,977
they also helped recover the bodies...

497
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:13,176
- of the fallen guards.
- Really?

498
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,246
My gosh. They're so cool.

499
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:16,747
They harvested and sold seaweed from Dokdo.

500
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:18,746
That's how they made a living.

501
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:19,986
(They set up an economic base on Dokdo...)

502
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:21,393
(by harvesting seaweed and abalones.)

503
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,516
It's very important to note that they engaged in...

504
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,927
economic activities on Dokdo.

505
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:28,926
- Yes. Right?
- Our country...

506
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:30,996
This was possible because Dokdo was our land.

507
00:18:30,997 --> 00:18:32,297
- Right.
- Yes.

508
00:18:32,497 --> 00:18:35,367
This is an important event to note.

509
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:38,636
Such activities took place on Dokdo.

510
00:18:38,637 --> 00:18:41,337
- It'd be nice to remember them.
- Gosh. Jeju haenyeos.

511
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:42,836
Jeju haenyeos.

512
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:45,107
Let's give him a big piece.

513
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:48,607
How does it taste?

514
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,176
- It's so good.
- It is indeed different.

515
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:52,246
It's tasty.

516
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:53,486
His answer was the funniest today.

517
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:54,817
- Cool haenyeos.
- Cool haenyeos.

518
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:57,056
- Cool haenyeos.
- That could very well be correct.

519
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:58,333
(He gets a bite thanks to Joon.)

520
00:18:58,357 --> 00:18:59,357
(Disappointed)

521
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:01,856
- Let's use this spare time...
- Here you go.

522
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:03,426
And give you one more question.

523
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:04,596
Do you have another question?

524
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:06,327
- Here it is. Listen up.
- Gosh.

525
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:09,867
The most famous volcanic island of Korea is Jeju Island.

526
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:11,496
- We all know that, right?
- Yes.

527
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:13,113
Ulleung Island is another volcanic island, right?

528
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:14,736
- Dokdo.
- Dokdo as well.

529
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:18,207
Then rank the islands in order from oldest...

530
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:21,077
to youngest.

531
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:23,376
- That's hard.
- The islands...

532
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:24,577
That's easy.

533
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:27,416
- Do you want to go first?
- Should I?

534
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,446
Sure.

535
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:31,257
Jeju Island, Ulleung Island, and Dokdo.

536
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:33,837
- I'll go with the reverse order.
- Why don't you...

537
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:36,126
Think about it. A volcano must've erupted first.

538
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:38,647
The biggest piece fell first like Jeju Island. Boom! Like that.

539
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:40,966
(Joon speculates that they were formed in order of size.)

540
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,196
(Wrong!)

541
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:44,036
- You see, the theme is Dokdo.
- Can I try it?

542
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:45,897
- Sure.
- Stop eating!

543
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:47,866
Let's give Se Yoon a try.

544
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:48,967
- Yes.
- Sure.

545
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:51,007
I don't need your pity.

546
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:53,446
- You didn't get to eat it, Se Yoon.
- Go ahead.

547
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:55,446
- I feel bad for you.
- I can't be sure.

548
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:56,546
Okay. Which one do you think was formed first?

549
00:19:56,547 --> 00:19:58,716
- We're talking about Dokdo today.
- Yes.

550
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:00,247
Dokdo has to be the first one.

551
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:02,446
- Dokdo.
- Right.

552
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:03,486
That's the oldest island.

553
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:04,916
- Right? Then...
- Which one is next?

554
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:08,326
If I pick Jeju Island next, it wouldn't fit the theme.

555
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:10,533
I should go with Dokdo, Ulleung Island, and Jeju Island.

556
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:12,477
- That's the vibe I'm getting.
- That's correct.

557
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:14,927
(Se Yoon gets a bite.)

558
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:17,387
(The islands were created from the volcanic eruption.)

559
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,937
(Dokdo, about 4.6 million years ago)

560
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:23,037
(Ulleung Island, about 2.5 million years ago)

561
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:26,637
(Jeju Island, about 1.8 million years ago)

562
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,846
When you guys film the show,

563
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:30,677
you at least give some food to them, right?

564
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:33,147
We're giving them a lot more food today...

565
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,146
- because you're here.
- They don't give us this much food.

566
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:36,956
- Really?
- We rarely get this much food.

567
00:20:36,957 --> 00:20:39,238
- This never happened before.
- It never happened before.

568
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:41,556
We'll meet the professor...

569
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:42,557
Okay.

570
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:44,096
- again tomorrow...
- What?

571
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:45,897
- on Dokdo.
- You can't do that.

572
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:47,796
He should sleep over, so we can talk.

573
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:49,527
- He's leaving after the meal?
- Yes.

574
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:51,466
We can sleep outside and talk.

575
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:52,666
(There's so much we haven't covered.)

576
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,066
- I'd love to stay over.
- We should talk about history.

577
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:55,666
- I'd love to.
- You know?

578
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,277
I'd love to play some games. You know?

579
00:20:57,707 --> 00:21:00,046
- We'll meet him again tomorrow.
- We'll meet again tomorrow.

580
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:02,346
We'll say goodbye to him for now.

581
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:03,347
- Really?
- Yes.

582
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:06,476
We will soon be going to Dokdo together.

583
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:08,686
- Yes.
- As for everything I covered,

584
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:10,386
they're very important.

585
00:21:10,387 --> 00:21:12,286
- Let's discuss that more on Dokdo.
- Okay.

586
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:13,627
- Okay.
- Okay.

587
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:16,796
Discussing that on Dokdo will be so meaningful.

588
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:18,126
Thank you so much for today.

589
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:19,556
- See you tomorrow.
- Thank you.

590
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:21,466
- Thank you.
- I'll see you tomorrow morning.

591
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:23,297
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes.

592
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:26,977
I wonder where we'll go on a full stomach.

593
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:28,907
We'll go to our base camp now.

594
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:30,636
My gosh.

595
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:31,976
- It's nice here.
- My gosh. Seriously.

596
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:33,446
Coming here for a few days...

597
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:35,053
- sounds good.
- Gosh. Let me open up the window.

598
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:37,676
- We ought to.
- ACs can't compete with this.

599
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:38,747
Of course not.

600
00:21:39,217 --> 00:21:42,947
(The drive along the coast on Ulleung Island is romantic.)

601
00:21:44,217 --> 00:21:45,516
I can feel the breeze on my skin.

602
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:46,826
(The breeze on my skin feels great.)

603
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:50,296
I'd love to have Dokdo shrimp alfresco here.

604
00:21:50,297 --> 00:21:52,396
(Having Dokdo shrimp alfresco must feel amazing.)

605
00:21:52,397 --> 00:21:53,796
That would be the best.

606
00:21:53,797 --> 00:21:55,526
And imagine having a clean room...

607
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:57,296
- where you can sleep behind you.
- Right.

608
00:21:57,297 --> 00:21:59,066
(Imagine how great it'd be to lie down and sleep.)

609
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,737
It looks like we'll be sleeping outdoors.

610
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:02,306
- Right? I don't see any houses.
- Seriously.

611
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:04,067
I don't think there's a proper house for us.

612
00:22:04,307 --> 00:22:05,977
Wait. We're going to a port?

613
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:08,676
- I hope we can go to sleep now.
- But...

614
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:10,377
everything is usually around a port.

615
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:12,077
I don't see any boats.

616
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:13,617
Wait.

617
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:15,287
Will we have to catch squid?

618
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:17,093
- Ulleung Island...
- Are you serious?

619
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:19,357
But that can't be our base camp.

620
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:22,027
Did they book the lodging facing the ocean?

621
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,657
- Did they?
- To leave right away tomorrow?

622
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:27,427
Going to Dokdo after catching squid will be tough.

623
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:29,697
Whoever ate a lot of squid should go.

624
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:31,196
Jong Min ate a lot.

625
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:32,567
(Jong Min should go.)

626
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:34,437
Shouldn't the professor go then?

627
00:22:34,707 --> 00:22:36,783
It would make sense if Jong Min and the professor go.

628
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:39,477
(Will he end up going on a boat to catch squid?)

629
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:41,647
I see a huge boat. Look on my left.

630
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,417
Is that for the Korea Coast Guard?

631
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:48,207
That looks pretty cool. I've never seen anything like that.

632
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,517
Are we going to get on their boat?

633
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,886
- Where?
- What?

634
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:54,526
- Are we getting on that boat?
- It can't be, right?

635
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:55,827
- No way.
- That can't be.

636
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:57,296
- What?
- What?

637
00:22:57,297 --> 00:22:59,337
Will we spend the night with the Korea Coast Guard?

638
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:02,026
- They set up cameras over there.
- What?

639
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:03,066
- What is this?
- What?

640
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,166
(The staff members are in front of the boat?)

641
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,396
This can't be happening.

642
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:07,136
- The professor said earlier...
- Yes.

643
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,236
- we could enter Dokdo for sure.
- Right.

644
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:10,576
- Enter where?
- But you can't guarantee that...

645
00:23:10,577 --> 00:23:11,876
when it comes to Dokdo...

646
00:23:11,877 --> 00:23:13,077
unless you're with the guards.

647
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:14,483
Are we going to sleep on Dokdo?

648
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:14,927
- Enter where?
- But you can't guarantee that...

649
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:16,166
when it comes to Dokdo...

650
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,597
unless you're with the guards.

651
00:23:17,703 --> 00:23:19,073
Are we going to sleep on Dokdo?

652
00:23:19,303 --> 00:23:21,103
- Everyone.
- What's going on?

653
00:23:21,203 --> 00:23:22,872
- What's this? What's going on?
- Why did you turn on the lights?

654
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:24,202
- What are we doing here?
- What is it?

655
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,543
What's going on? What?

656
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,973
Aren't they the Korea Coast Guard?

657
00:23:27,743 --> 00:23:28,982
- We have now...
- What?

658
00:23:28,983 --> 00:23:30,712
- Will they arrest us for a crime?
- Did we do something wrong?

659
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:32,182
Arrived at our base camp.

660
00:23:32,183 --> 00:23:34,053
What? We're sleeping on that vessel?

661
00:23:34,253 --> 00:23:35,693
- This is our base camp?
- For real?

662
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,782
What are we doing here? This is for the Korea Coast Guard.

663
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,153
- The vessel behind you...
- What?

664
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,563
Is your base camp for the night.

665
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:45,022
The Korea Coast Guard?

666
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,932
- The scale of this thing is crazy.
- What's going on?

667
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:47,992
No way.

668
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,832
So people said there was no base camp.

669
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,833
Last night, I slept on a cruise. Today...

670
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:53,732
- On that?
- The vessel...

671
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,332
protects our territorial waters...

672
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,643
around Ulleung Island and Dokdo in the East Sea.

673
00:23:58,243 --> 00:23:59,512
This is the guard ship...

674
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:00,949
for the Korea Coast Guard of the East Sea.

675
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,612
- That's an important ship.
- This is crazy.

676
00:24:02,613 --> 00:24:05,082
You will now board the guard ship...

677
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,803
- Will we go to Dokdo?
- and head to Dokdo.

678
00:24:07,053 --> 00:24:09,052
You'll spend the night on the water.

679
00:24:09,053 --> 00:24:10,883
- What?
- How long does it take?

680
00:24:11,023 --> 00:24:12,552
- It will sail slowly like a cruise?
- It will sail slowly.

681
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:13,623
Yes. And...

682
00:24:13,923 --> 00:24:17,162
I've invited someone to introduce the guard ship.

683
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:18,163
My gosh. This is...

684
00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:20,092
- Hello.
- My gosh.

685
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:21,662
- Nice to meet you. Welcome.
- Hello.

686
00:24:21,663 --> 00:24:23,623
- Please stand in the middle.
- Nice to meet you.

687
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:24,803
Okay.

688
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:26,572
Hello.

689
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:29,742
I serve the Korea Coast Guard Vessel 3017 in the East Sea.

690
00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:31,342
I'm Police Corporal Lee Jin Woo.

691
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:32,742
- Nice to meet you.
- Lee Jin Woo?

692
00:24:32,743 --> 00:24:33,812
Yes, I'm Lee Jin Woo.

693
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:34,912
- Corporal Jin Woo.
- Corporal Lee Jin Woo.

694
00:24:34,913 --> 00:24:36,412
- Then...
- The Korea Coast Guard.

695
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:39,612
Instead of being in the military, you're the police?

696
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:41,313
Yes, as a police officer,

697
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,353
- I guard the sea.
- That's amazing.

698
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:50,892
(Protecting Ulleung Island, Dokdo, and the East Sea)

699
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:52,963
(Korea Coast Guard of the East Sea)

700
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:55,832
(Defending our maritime territory, )

701
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:58,353
(preventing maritime crimes, and performing disaster relief...)

702
00:24:59,703 --> 00:25:04,203
(Heroes who carry out a wide range of missions 24 hours a day)

703
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:11,446
(Protecting Dokdo by monitoring and responding to Japanese vessels)

704
00:25:12,716 --> 00:25:18,116
(The Korea Coast Guard of the East Sea protects Dokdo.)

705
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,226
How did we get invited?

706
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:23,855
Dokdo Day is October 25.

707
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,165
- Right.
- To commemorate the day,

708
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,736
we will take you to Dokdo in our vessel.

709
00:25:28,896 --> 00:25:30,065
This is unbelievable.

710
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:33,605
I can't believe that we'll go to Dokdo in this vessel.

711
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:37,005
We will move now under the corporal's guide.

712
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:38,375
- Okay, let's go.
- What an honor.

713
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:40,406
- I feel so honored.
- Isn't this meaningful?

714
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,946
I can't believe that I'm getting on a naval vessel.

715
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:44,575
This is incredible. Let's go.

716
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,786
- I'll film it.
- Everyone.

717
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:47,916
We will move with the corporal.

718
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:49,856
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

719
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,155
Goodness.

720
00:25:51,156 --> 00:25:52,756
Is this a boat?

721
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:54,455
Is this a lifeboat?

722
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:56,576
When you go to Dokdo tomorrow, you'll take this boat.

723
00:25:57,526 --> 00:25:59,326
After anchoring the naval vessel?

724
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:02,236
(8 hours later)

725
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:08,876
(The members got on the boat to get to the island.)

726
00:26:09,076 --> 00:26:10,306
It's very...

727
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:19,516
(The moment they've been waiting for to set out to Dokdo)

728
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:28,355
(To our island that fills us with reverence)

729
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:31,526
No matter how much they claim it as their own

730
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:37,866
(Soon, we will meet Dokdo.)

731
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:42,576
(They start to board the patrol vessel.)

732
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,176
Hello.

733
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:45,946
It's nice to meet you.

734
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,546
Hello.

735
00:26:49,646 --> 00:26:52,416
Oh, my. It's completely new. It's a new ship.

736
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,545
Joon, this was built last year.

737
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,416
Right. I can tell that it's new.

738
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,125
- It's brand new.
- The paint hasn't even chipped.

739
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:00,286
It's totally new.

740
00:27:00,426 --> 00:27:02,055
- It looks amazing.
- What's this metal?

741
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:03,295
It smells like metal.

742
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,355
It seems like it was recently painted.

743
00:27:05,356 --> 00:27:06,526
The fire hydrant.

744
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:08,296
Fire.

745
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,196
Goodness.

746
00:27:10,936 --> 00:27:13,606
- Like this...
- These are private rooms.

747
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:21,106
(Dormitory)

748
00:27:21,546 --> 00:27:22,675
This is awesome.

749
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:23,975
(First time seeing the inside of a patrol vessel)

750
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,115
- There's a laundry room.
- Please go upstairs.

751
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:27,685
- Upstairs?
- Okay.

752
00:27:27,686 --> 00:27:29,326
(Once you pass the rooms and go upstairs)

753
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:34,926
Please go this way.

754
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:36,395
- It's the pilothouse.
- We're here.

755
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:37,756
- This is the pilothouse.
- Hello.

756
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:39,926
- Hello. Thank you for inviting us.
- My gosh.

757
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:41,226
(Impressed)

758
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:43,365
- Gosh.
- Hello.

759
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:44,466
Hello.

760
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:45,805
- Hello.
- Gosh.

761
00:27:45,806 --> 00:27:46,806
(They enter the pilothouse.)

762
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:48,166
What is this place?

763
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:50,575
- The pilothouse?
- Yes, it's the pilothouse.

764
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:53,205
Is this what we saw in "Real Men?"

765
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:54,406
(Pilothouse)

766
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:58,745
(Where navigation and speed are managed)

767
00:27:58,746 --> 00:28:01,515
(It's the control center of a patrol vessel.)

768
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:03,155
During navigation, we coordinate...

769
00:28:03,156 --> 00:28:07,755
radar, steering, engine control, and communication systems.

770
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:10,355
We oversee all ship operations.

771
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,766
How many people operate a vessel like this?

772
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:14,595
One person in this seat.

773
00:28:14,596 --> 00:28:16,835
Are there also assistants?

774
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:19,136
Everyone else assists him.

775
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:21,835
If the vessel deviates from its course due to the wind or current,

776
00:28:21,836 --> 00:28:23,375
then corrections are made.

777
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:27,275
The structure underneath the chair is unusual.

778
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:28,916
They look like chairs at a hair salon.

779
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:31,246
While navigating, the highest wave...

780
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,445
we encountered was 11m.

781
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:34,885
- Gosh, 11m?
- Did you say 11m?

782
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:36,116
That's like a tsunami.

783
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,625
(Despite the towering waves, )

784
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:44,095
(their deployment mission has to continue.)

785
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:46,695
- As the chairs sway back and forth, - Yes.

786
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:48,195
- you get less tired.
- Right.

787
00:28:48,196 --> 00:28:50,336
- That's why they look like this.
- It's fascinating.

788
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,835
(The members move onto the next place.)

789
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:56,076
- Do we go downstairs?
- Yes.

790
00:28:59,976 --> 00:29:01,506
The stairs are quite steep.

791
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,175
The stairs are almost perpendicular.

792
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:07,715
(Extremely steep)

793
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:09,115
- Please go all the way down.
- Okay.

794
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:10,685
- It's perpendicular.
- When they get dispatched,

795
00:29:10,686 --> 00:29:12,186
they would have to jump down.

796
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:14,625
- You could get hurt easily.
- The employees fell down...

797
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:16,425
- Right?
- when there were big waves.

798
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:17,426
- I can imagine.
- Really?

799
00:29:17,426 --> 00:29:18,426
- When you go down in a hurry.
- You could get seriously injured.

800
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:19,495
- On the stairs?
- Yes.

801
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:20,995
- Gosh.
- They would move in a hurry...

802
00:29:20,996 --> 00:29:22,596
- when there's an emergency.
- Right.

803
00:29:22,936 --> 00:29:26,366
Since we're in the sea, there's a lot of humidity on the stairs.

804
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,176
Gosh, what's this?

805
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:33,606
It looks amazing.

806
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:36,745
This is it.

807
00:29:36,746 --> 00:29:38,346
(The hull of the East Sea patrol vessel)

808
00:29:38,516 --> 00:29:40,715
(The deck)

809
00:29:40,716 --> 00:29:42,086
This is it.

810
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,015
(The central area for helicopter operations)

811
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:48,156
Transferring emergency patients or delivering supplies.

812
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,626
This is where it takes place.

813
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:55,526
(The central space for naval operations)

814
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:58,035
- It's nice and clean.
- Isn't this a heliport?

815
00:29:58,036 --> 00:29:59,136
Yes, it's a heliport.

816
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,935
We got to see everywhere inside.

817
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:04,205
In order to defend the East Sea,

818
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:05,975
the Coast Guards are...

819
00:30:05,976 --> 00:30:07,205
I feel very reassured.

820
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:09,045
They're working very hard.

821
00:30:09,046 --> 00:30:10,475
Spending eight nights on the vessel...

822
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,416
- Of course.
- must be stifling.

823
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:15,015
- I miss my family the most.
- Right.

824
00:30:15,016 --> 00:30:17,085
His children are 1 and 4 years old.

825
00:30:17,086 --> 00:30:18,485
- Do you have children?
- Yes.

826
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:19,986
He got married at an early age.

827
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:23,095
With the distance, you must miss them a lot.

828
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:24,456
Four-year-olds are adorable.

829
00:30:24,796 --> 00:30:27,666
It's sad to say goodbye to them,

830
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:30,666
but my heart flutters when I'm about to return home.

831
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,105
- That's what keeps me going.
- Before seeing your children?

832
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:34,136
Yes.

833
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,006
(Working in the perilous sea)

834
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:40,075
(While being away from their families, )

835
00:30:40,076 --> 00:30:41,976
(they prioritize the safety of the people)

836
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:47,316
(They're the unseen heroes.)

837
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:53,485
- Everyone.
- Yes?

838
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:55,385
- The ship will be departing soon.
- Right.

839
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,395
(The Coast Guard vessel is preparing to set sail.)

840
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,955
Coast Guard officers will take shifts...

841
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:01,395
- and be on duty for 24 hours.
- Goodness.

842
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:03,535
They will safeguard not only Dokdo but also the East Sea.

843
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:05,396
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

844
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:07,905
- We can't just sit back and watch.
- Of course not.

845
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:09,205
- So, - Are we sleeping outdoors?

846
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:11,905
We will select only the two of you.

847
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:13,906
The two of you will join the Korea Coast Guard...

848
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:17,345
on their night duty shift.

849
00:31:17,346 --> 00:31:18,676
Like what we did on Buchi Peak?

850
00:31:19,216 --> 00:31:20,615
- By the way...
- In the morning,

851
00:31:20,616 --> 00:31:22,176
- the officers will get to rest.
- Yes.

852
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:23,585
What about us?

853
00:31:23,586 --> 00:31:25,515
Since you're on 2 Days 1 Night team,

854
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,986
you'll follow our schedule.

855
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:28,625
Are we staying up all night?

856
00:31:28,626 --> 00:31:29,795
(Turning gray)

857
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:31,255
- What if...
- Are we staying up all night?

858
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,596
Joon and Se Yoon get picked?

859
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:35,566
That would be the worst.

860
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:37,936
It'd be our worst trip to Ulleung Island.

861
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,005
I'm about to lose my mind.

862
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:41,235
I've already lost it.

863
00:31:41,236 --> 00:31:42,265
All right.

864
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:43,882
Night duty shift is staying up all night.

865
00:31:43,906 --> 00:31:45,075
That's right.

866
00:31:45,076 --> 00:31:46,996
Doesn't their shift end at eight in the morning?

867
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:48,545
If I get picked, it'll be over for me.

868
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:50,146
This is too intense.

869
00:31:50,246 --> 00:31:52,685
This is night duty shift game.

870
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:53,945
- How do we pick the two?
- It's a game.

871
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:57,155
Let's invite those who will join the mission.

872
00:31:57,156 --> 00:31:59,386
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

873
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,855
- Hello.
- Hello.

874
00:32:03,856 --> 00:32:04,995
- Is it the two of you?
- Yes.

875
00:32:04,996 --> 00:32:06,125
- Please stand here.
- Welcome.

876
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:07,866
Could you introduce yourselves?

877
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:09,735
Hello, I serve the Korea Coast Guard...

878
00:32:09,736 --> 00:32:11,365
Vessel 3017.

879
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:12,905
I'm Constable Cho Min Ji.

880
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:15,066
- She's a police officer.
- Constable Cho Min Ji.

881
00:32:16,176 --> 00:32:17,305
May I say what I prepared?

882
00:32:17,306 --> 00:32:18,475
- Of course.
- Okay.

883
00:32:18,476 --> 00:32:21,446
It's really nice to meet you. Thank you very much.

884
00:32:21,676 --> 00:32:23,115
I serve the Korea Coast Guard.

885
00:32:23,116 --> 00:32:24,846
I'm Constable Song Bo Geum.

886
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,085
- Sae Ho, could you show us?
- Hello, Bo Geum.

887
00:32:27,086 --> 00:32:29,485
It's really nice to meet you. Thank you very much.

888
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:30,655
- Yes.
- Hello.

889
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:31,985
- Thank you.
- RNMY, TYVM.

890
00:32:31,986 --> 00:32:33,585
- Exactly.
- It was RNMY, TYVM.

891
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:34,625
Thank you.

892
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:36,996
- Gosh.
- You sent her a heart.

893
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:39,625
The three of them are team leaders.

894
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:42,165
Each leader will pick two team members.

895
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,596
Are they picking us?

896
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:44,935
Moon Se Yoon.

897
00:32:44,936 --> 00:32:46,105
(They pick their favorite members.)

898
00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:47,935
- I pick Cho Sae Ho.
- Okay.

899
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:49,006
Thank you.

900
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:51,506
Could you stand with your team members?

901
00:32:52,106 --> 00:32:53,875
The teams have been decided.

902
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:55,245
- Okay. Let's go.
- All right.

903
00:32:55,246 --> 00:32:57,845
Here's your first mission...

904
00:32:57,846 --> 00:32:59,315
with the three police officers.

905
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:01,185
It's a mission where you have to be in sync.

906
00:33:01,186 --> 00:33:02,386
- I see.
- Let's try our best.

907
00:33:02,656 --> 00:33:04,086
It's Zero People.

908
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:05,685
Do you know Zero People?

909
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:06,885
- Zero People?
- Yes.

910
00:33:06,886 --> 00:33:08,825
- We have to sit down.
- I see.

911
00:33:08,826 --> 00:33:10,526
- Do we move ourselves instead?
- Yes.

912
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:12,696
He's the best celebrity of Zero People game.

913
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:13,765
- Really?
- Yes.

914
00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:15,996
All we have to do is stay seated.

915
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,165
- We did it last time.
- I don't remember.

916
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:18,595
Sit down. Let's do an example.

917
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,535
- One, two, three. Two.
- Next...

918
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:22,705
(The celebrity in this team doesn't know.)

919
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:24,252
- If you get caught, you'll be out.
- Next...

920
00:33:24,276 --> 00:33:25,335
- We've played it before.
- Right.

921
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,876
(What was it?)

922
00:33:27,076 --> 00:33:28,945
- It's based on luck.
- It's all about luck.

923
00:33:28,946 --> 00:33:30,715
Each team will play.

924
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:31,975
Each team will play.

925
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,885
The team that lasts the longest...

926
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:36,285
will be exempted.

927
00:33:36,286 --> 00:33:38,355
- It's based on luck anyway.
- Even if we work, we'll have fun.

928
00:33:38,356 --> 00:33:39,486
Of course.

929
00:33:39,856 --> 00:33:41,956
Team One, please come to the center.

930
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,295
(Sighing)

931
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:44,825
- That's right.
- Please.

932
00:33:44,826 --> 00:33:45,856
Song Bo Geum.

933
00:33:45,996 --> 00:33:48,165
- I bet Joon won't get up.
- Let's not stop each other.

934
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50,065
You can get up often or stay seated.

935
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:52,065
This is all about how you feel.

936
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:53,665
Trust your feelings.

937
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:55,405
Night duty shift is at stake.

938
00:33:55,406 --> 00:33:56,936
Please watch each other carefully.

939
00:33:57,206 --> 00:33:59,175
DinDin is ready to cheat.

940
00:33:59,176 --> 00:34:00,205
What are you talking about?

941
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:02,275
How can I cheat in front of the police officers?

942
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:04,145
- Okay.
- Is this even possible to cheat?

943
00:34:04,146 --> 00:34:05,175
(Playing dumb)

944
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,545
They'll arrest you if you cheat.

945
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:07,685
- All right.
- We can do it.

946
00:34:07,686 --> 00:34:09,286
- One, two, three. Let's go.
- Let's go.

947
00:34:10,486 --> 00:34:11,885
- Give it your all.
- Okay.

948
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:13,502
- What do you think?
- That's a great idea.

949
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:14,685
Of course.

950
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,155
- Just trust your feelings.
- Okay.

951
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:17,355
Let's go.

952
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,895
Okay.

953
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:20,065
- Shall we start?
- Shall we start?

954
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:21,165
Go.

955
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,895
- Okay.
- Here goes the first team.

956
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,496
- Okay.
- Get ready.

957
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:27,166
(I hope they get doomed.)

958
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,675
Let's start. One, two, three.

959
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:30,676
One.

960
00:34:30,676 --> 00:34:31,676
(They succeed 1 time.)

961
00:34:31,677 --> 00:34:33,076
One, two, three. One.

962
00:34:33,276 --> 00:34:35,706
(What?)

963
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:37,215
I knew this would happen.

964
00:34:37,216 --> 00:34:38,876
- Okay, they lost.
- In that case...

965
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:42,445
(We thought that they were dodging well.)

966
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:44,115
One, two, three. One.

967
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,886
(Flinching)

968
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:49,626
(Sae Ho and Joon succeed 1 time.)

969
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,966
(Cheering)

970
00:34:53,026 --> 00:34:54,825
What about a practice round?

971
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,765
- Who's next?
- Wasn't that a practice round?

972
00:34:56,766 --> 00:34:58,636
- There's no practice round.
- Okay.

973
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:01,405
(They wasted the first round.)

974
00:35:01,406 --> 00:35:03,806
- We can consider ourselves safe.
- Goodness.

975
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,845
- Fight hard today.
- This is...

976
00:35:06,846 --> 00:35:07,846
Fight all day long.

977
00:35:07,847 --> 00:35:08,982
(Only scars remain in their teamwork)

978
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,346
Let's get started.

979
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:11,776
This is DinDin's team.

980
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,446
Here we go.

981
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:16,155
- Zero.
- One, two, three.

982
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:17,255
- Two.
- Gosh.

983
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:18,715
One, two, three. One.

984
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,226
(They succeed 2 times.)

985
00:35:20,456 --> 00:35:22,695
(They already outran Sae Ho and Joon.)

986
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:24,556
- It's over for us.
- One, two, three. One.

987
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,165
One, two, three. One.

988
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,295
Okay.

989
00:35:27,296 --> 00:35:29,266
- I didn't have to get up.
- Okay.

990
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:30,966
Are we still playing?

991
00:35:31,566 --> 00:35:32,936
Didn't you just get up?

992
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:35,165
- Play until the end.
- Okay, let's focus.

993
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,206
(He's feeling jealous.)

994
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:39,176
- Either way...
- You understand it, don't you?

995
00:35:39,476 --> 00:35:41,176
One, two, three, One.

996
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:42,946
One, two, three. Zero.

997
00:35:45,116 --> 00:35:47,616
(They were slightly late.)

998
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,816
(They succeed 5 times.)

999
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:52,686
(They're quite good.)

1000
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:54,526
One, two, three. One.

1001
00:35:54,856 --> 00:35:56,095
(Getting up)

1002
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:58,526
- One.
- I'm sorry.

1003
00:35:58,556 --> 00:35:59,995
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1004
00:35:59,996 --> 00:36:01,325
(You still did a good job.)

1005
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,166
- It was difficult.
- We succeeded many times.

1006
00:36:03,336 --> 00:36:04,735
Jong Hyun.

1007
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,895
Cover your mouth.

1008
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:07,936
- You were looking at my mouth.
- Cover your mouth.

1009
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,835
When you hear that, get up.

1010
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:11,706
If I don't hear anything, stay seated.

1011
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:13,345
(Staring)

1012
00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:14,446
Zero.

1013
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:18,716
(His lips don't lie.)

1014
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:20,646
He's going to cover his mouth.

1015
00:36:21,116 --> 00:36:22,992
- He'll cover his mouth.
- Then we have to listen.

1016
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:25,455
For you and the corporal, it's up to you.

1017
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:26,755
I'll be listening.

1018
00:36:26,756 --> 00:36:28,585
We'll be fine as long as you do well.

1019
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,695
Only I will get up. The two of you should stay seated.

1020
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:32,026
Let's do it.

1021
00:36:33,596 --> 00:36:34,666
Three.

1022
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:37,065
- Okay.
- Okay?

1023
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:38,265
(He shares the secret with a bright smile.)

1024
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:39,366
I'll keep that in mind.

1025
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:41,965
- One, two, three. Three.
- Like that?

1026
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,906
(DinDin and Seon Ho are ahead with 5 points.)

1027
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,205
(Jong Min and Se Yoon's attempt)

1028
00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:47,146
Here's what I think.

1029
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:48,876
The corporal is a bit nervous.

1030
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,445
The corporal is nervous right now.

1031
00:36:50,446 --> 00:36:52,115
- It's because he's cold.
- He's very nervous.

1032
00:36:52,116 --> 00:36:54,436
- He'll get up right away.
- He's coming down with a cold.

1033
00:36:54,486 --> 00:36:56,586
- I'm getting nervous.
- Jong Min.

1034
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,285
The two of us will stay seated. Only you will play.

1035
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:01,486
I know, but I feel nervous.

1036
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:04,095
- The team in first place survives.
- Right.

1037
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,325
It's hard to tell the result. Only the first place survives.

1038
00:37:06,326 --> 00:37:07,396
That's right.

1039
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:09,395
- We're good to go.
- We already placed first.

1040
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:10,612
All we have to do is go to bed.

1041
00:37:10,636 --> 00:37:11,766
You think so?

1042
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:13,706
We have the King of Zero, Kim Jong Min.

1043
00:37:14,236 --> 00:37:15,236
(King of Zero)

1044
00:37:15,237 --> 00:37:16,276
It's only about luck.

1045
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,676
- All right, here we go.
- The corporal will get up.

1046
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:22,915
One, two, three. Three.

1047
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:25,016
(They succeed 1 time.)

1048
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:28,616
(King of Zero concentrates only on what he hears.)

1049
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,285
(Will they succeed more than 5 times?)

1050
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:31,356
Do you feel it?

1051
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:33,286
One, two, three. Zero.

1052
00:37:33,826 --> 00:37:35,885
- He got up late.
- That was slightly late.

1053
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,526
- He was late.
- Jong Min is doing well.

1054
00:37:37,826 --> 00:37:39,225
One, two, three. One.

1055
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:40,325
(They succeed 3 times.)

1056
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:41,725
One, two, three. One.

1057
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:42,795
(They succeed 4 times.)

1058
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:43,796
One, two, three.

1059
00:37:43,797 --> 00:37:46,136
(Surprised)

1060
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:48,866
(If they succeed one more, their scores will tie.)

1061
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,505
One, two, three. Three.

1062
00:37:50,506 --> 00:37:52,106
(They succeed 5 times.)

1063
00:37:52,576 --> 00:37:55,106
(Their scores tied in an instant.)

1064
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:58,416
(If they pass this time, Jong Min and Se Yoon will get exempted.)

1065
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:00,146
One, two, three. Zero.

1066
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,116
One, two, three. Zero.

1067
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:07,925
One, two, three. Zero.

1068
00:38:07,926 --> 00:38:10,356
(They succeed 6 times.)

1069
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:14,265
(King of Zero made it.)

1070
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:15,325
That was amazing.

1071
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,465
(Jong Min and Se Yoon are exempt from the night duty shift.)

1072
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:17,466
How many times have we done it?

1073
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:19,865
(Speechless)

1074
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:20,965
You'll play as long as you can.

1075
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,466
One, two, three. One.

1076
00:38:23,106 --> 00:38:25,336
One, two, three. One.

1077
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:27,645
One, two, three. Zero.

1078
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:29,376
(They succeed 9 times.)

1079
00:38:29,546 --> 00:38:30,546
(Jealous)

1080
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:32,216
One, two, three. One.

1081
00:38:32,816 --> 00:38:34,286
One, two, three. Two.

1082
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,556
One, two, three. Two.

1083
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:39,016
(What's the matter with them?)

1084
00:38:39,256 --> 00:38:40,726
One, two, three. Two.

1085
00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:41,955
(Jong Min and Se Yoon succeed 12 times.)

1086
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:42,956
We're free.

1087
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:45,825
- It's King of Zero, Kim Jong Min.
- What?

1088
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:47,026
(He proved himself as a king.)

1089
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:48,765
- That's enough.
- I'll stop.

1090
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:50,072
- How many times did we win?
- I won't do it anymore.

1091
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:52,736
Se Yoon and Jong Min are exempt from the night duty shift.

1092
00:38:53,606 --> 00:38:54,835
He survived.

1093
00:38:54,836 --> 00:38:56,236
It will be one of us.

1094
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,705
- Unlike them, we had no strategies.
- I'm jealous.

1095
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:00,975
Here's your second mission.

1096
00:39:00,976 --> 00:39:02,276
(Night duty shift game, Round 2)

1097
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,075
The second mission is a knot game.

1098
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,175
- Knot?
- That's hard.

1099
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:07,716
Maybe they have to undo a knot.

1100
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:12,585
In maritime rescue operations, the rope knotting techniques...

1101
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:14,256
are essential for saving lives.

1102
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:15,785
That's why we prepared it.

1103
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,726
(An essential training for Coast Guard officers)

1104
00:39:17,796 --> 00:39:18,796
Please set them up.

1105
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:21,195
- We should step aside.
- Right.

1106
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:22,325
I feel bad, but...

1107
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,336
Let's get some fresh air.

1108
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:26,465
The four types of knots were made...

1109
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:27,906
by the rescue workers.

1110
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:31,236
Two of them get undone when you pull them.

1111
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:34,106
The other two are impossible to undo.

1112
00:39:35,446 --> 00:39:37,445
You'll succeed if the knots get undone.

1113
00:39:37,446 --> 00:39:39,945
The member to pick knots that are impossible to undo...

1114
00:39:39,946 --> 00:39:41,345
will get the night duty shift.

1115
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,946
- So the knots should get undone?
- Yes.

1116
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,576
If you undo the knots, your life will be without problems.

1117
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:47,985
They said that they know by looking at them.

1118
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:49,595
(The officers know the answer because they're trained.)

1119
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:50,695
That's amazing.

1120
00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:51,925
How can you tell?

1121
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:52,926
(Impossible to distinguish with the naked eye)

1122
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:55,226
Do we have to pick from here?

1123
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:58,165
- Don't go over the line.
- That's fine.

1124
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:59,295
(Don't step on the line.)

1125
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,465
(Being wary)

1126
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:02,566
In what order will you choose?

1127
00:40:02,706 --> 00:40:04,735
I'll pick number one so that it's clear-cut.

1128
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,936
- Number one?
- Yes.

1129
00:40:06,076 --> 00:40:07,346
Then I pick number two.

1130
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,146
Let's stand in order.

1131
00:40:09,446 --> 00:40:10,616
I pick number three.

1132
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:11,975
This one is the worst.

1133
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,746
I don't care anymore. I pick number four.

1134
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:17,756
I think I can tell.

1135
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,876
I can't tell from looking at them.

1136
00:40:19,956 --> 00:40:21,356
I can't tell from looking at them.

1137
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:23,525
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1138
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:24,555
(Pit-a-pat)

1139
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:25,796
Shall we start with number one?

1140
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:27,525
- Let's go.
- Number one.

1141
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:29,326
I can pull it slowly, can't I?

1142
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:31,466
Hold this rope.

1143
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:32,796
Se Yoon.

1144
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:35,065
He will pull your wrist.

1145
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:36,165
No, right there.

1146
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,476
- Cho Sae Ho.
- Here I go.

1147
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:39,605
- Pull it slowly.
- The Coast Guards are with us.

1148
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:40,776
(We'll be right back.)

1149
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:43,716
(They start pulling.)

1150
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:46,176
- Pull it slowly.
- The Coast Guards are with us.

1151
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,599
- Here I go.
- Pull it slowly.

1152
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,869
(They start pulling.)

1153
00:40:53,403 --> 00:40:55,363
- Pull it slowly.
- The Coast Guards are with us.

1154
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:01,003
The Coast Guards are with us.

1155
00:41:01,713 --> 00:41:03,212
It looks like number one could get undone.

1156
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:04,273
(Slowly)

1157
00:41:05,383 --> 00:41:08,953
(The knots get undone neatly.)

1158
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:11,012
(Sae Ho is exempt from the night duty shift.)

1159
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,483
Number one looked too obvious.

1160
00:41:13,923 --> 00:41:15,452
You're exempt from the night duty shift.

1161
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:17,552
(Dancing steps)

1162
00:41:17,553 --> 00:41:18,622
No.

1163
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:19,983
- She's so disappointed.
- Oh, no.

1164
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:22,632
I thought the last knot would stay entangled,

1165
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:23,863
but it didn't.

1166
00:41:24,263 --> 00:41:25,303
You're safe.

1167
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:27,202
My chance of losing is two-thirds.

1168
00:41:27,203 --> 00:41:28,683
(His chance of losing is two-thirds.)

1169
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:33,272
He won't do the night shift. Oh, my.

1170
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:34,702
(Celebrating his victory)

1171
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:35,983
- Do a double under.
- Goodness.

1172
00:41:36,743 --> 00:41:38,142
(He's so excited.)

1173
00:41:38,143 --> 00:41:40,813
Look at his performance. He's celebrating.

1174
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:42,452
Look at that.

1175
00:41:42,453 --> 00:41:43,853
(He skips twice.)

1176
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:45,522
Number two?

1177
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:47,199
(The pressure of the night duty shift gets worse.)

1178
00:41:47,223 --> 00:41:48,992
- Number 2.
- Who is number 2?

1179
00:41:48,993 --> 00:41:51,023
Isn't it over once number two gets undone?

1180
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:52,462
- I guess so.
- I feel bad.

1181
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:54,583
- Maybe number two won't get undone.
- I bet it will.

1182
00:41:55,163 --> 00:41:57,132
You're doing it in order. We don't know the result.

1183
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:59,362
- The worst trip to Ulleung Island.
- This won't get undone.

1184
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:00,862
The worst trip to Ulleung Island for Joon.

1185
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:02,633
(The reason why Joon is so desperate)

1186
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,903
(He gets picked to depart one day before the shoot.)

1187
00:42:06,143 --> 00:42:08,543
(Groggy)

1188
00:42:08,843 --> 00:42:12,243
(He hiked as soon as he arrived.)

1189
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:16,683
(He placed last in the quiz without saying a word.)

1190
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:19,222
The worst trip to Ulleung Island for Joon.

1191
00:42:19,223 --> 00:42:20,322
The man of Ulleung Island.

1192
00:42:20,323 --> 00:42:21,323
(What will happen to the man of Ulleung Island?)

1193
00:42:21,324 --> 00:42:22,769
He shoots 3 Days 2 Nights by himself.

1194
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:24,153
A night duty shift on top of that.

1195
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:26,692
Here we go, Joon.

1196
00:42:26,693 --> 00:42:28,909
- There's something wrong with it.
- The man of Ulleung Island.

1197
00:42:28,933 --> 00:42:30,592
One, two...

1198
00:42:30,593 --> 00:42:31,632
(Looking away)

1199
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:32,633
Three.

1200
00:42:34,163 --> 00:42:35,773
- Three.
- Let's go, night duty shift.

1201
00:42:36,403 --> 00:42:38,872
(Being dragged)

1202
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:39,873
Let's go.

1203
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:41,942
(I pity you.)

1204
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:42,972
Goodness.

1205
00:42:42,973 --> 00:42:44,843
Joon gets the night duty shift.

1206
00:42:45,543 --> 00:42:47,382
- These knots look...
- Oh, no.

1207
00:42:47,383 --> 00:42:49,453
Connected.

1208
00:42:49,853 --> 00:42:51,452
These are called butterfly knots.

1209
00:42:51,453 --> 00:42:54,052
When we hook something on it...

1210
00:42:54,053 --> 00:42:56,452
- Do you hook it on here?
- Undoing them is impossible.

1211
00:42:56,453 --> 00:42:59,293
You told me to get here a day before.

1212
00:42:59,723 --> 00:43:01,093
That's when everything went wrong.

1213
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:03,092
Can we do it at the same time?

1214
00:43:03,093 --> 00:43:04,462
(Only one of them will get the night duty shift.)

1215
00:43:04,463 --> 00:43:06,102
- Put your wrist in.
- Let's do it simultaneously.

1216
00:43:06,103 --> 00:43:07,463
(DinDin versus Seon Ho)

1217
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:09,903
These two are the most confusing ones.

1218
00:43:10,973 --> 00:43:12,242
These won't get undone.

1219
00:43:12,243 --> 00:43:14,002
- I'll put my finger in.
- Grab the rope here.

1220
00:43:14,003 --> 00:43:15,012
(It's hard to tell from the shape.)

1221
00:43:15,013 --> 00:43:17,972
- They both look impossible.
- One of them gets undone easily.

1222
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,312
- Really?
- Yes.

1223
00:43:19,313 --> 00:43:20,313
(Sighing heavily)

1224
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:24,553
(A wail resonates quietly.)

1225
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:28,693
(He doesn't care who wins.)

1226
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:31,692
- I don't think this will be untied.
- I agree, but yours also...

1227
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,262
- I think this one will be untied.
- I mean, it goes in here...

1228
00:43:33,263 --> 00:43:35,263
Okay. Let's start. I can see it.

1229
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:36,992
- It's tied tightly.
- This won't untie.

1230
00:43:36,993 --> 00:43:38,509
- Pull it already.
- It's coming loose.

1231
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,703
- It's already coming loose.
- Oh, that's right.

1232
00:43:40,963 --> 00:43:43,272
- One, two, - It's coming loose already.

1233
00:43:43,273 --> 00:43:44,273
Three.

1234
00:43:44,274 --> 00:43:47,403
(They pulled the ropes!)

1235
00:43:47,443 --> 00:43:48,573
Let's go!

1236
00:43:51,643 --> 00:43:52,683
Let's go!

1237
00:43:55,753 --> 00:43:57,283
- Three.
- Let's go!

1238
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:03,493
(Tightening)

1239
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:06,923
(Teasing DinDin by showing his front teeth)

1240
00:44:07,623 --> 00:44:11,463
(Seon Ho is exempt from the night duty.)

1241
00:44:11,663 --> 00:44:13,402
(DinDin stays still like a rock just like Joon.)

1242
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:14,903
Jump rope with this.

1243
00:44:15,073 --> 00:44:16,403
- Do it here.
- Let it go.

1244
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:18,702
(The two losers are together in the same frame.)

1245
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:20,073
Please just let it go.

1246
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:23,873
(They might jump rope all night long.)

1247
00:44:24,573 --> 00:44:25,612
Gosh, hey.

1248
00:44:25,613 --> 00:44:27,213
(He throws a tantrum after a long time.)

1249
00:44:27,283 --> 00:44:28,412
So he'll be on the night duty.

1250
00:44:28,413 --> 00:44:29,852
- Congratulations.
- Right.

1251
00:44:29,853 --> 00:44:31,659
(It's good to make good memories while working the night shift.)

1252
00:44:31,683 --> 00:44:33,782
Great job, everyone.

1253
00:44:33,783 --> 00:44:36,923
We thank all the officers for joining us.

1254
00:44:36,993 --> 00:44:38,962
- It's awesome. I won.
- This patrol vessel will leave...

1255
00:44:38,963 --> 00:44:41,492
- for Dokdo shortly.
- Got it.

1256
00:44:41,493 --> 00:44:45,502
Joon and DinDin should start working the night shift right away.

1257
00:44:45,503 --> 00:44:49,803
The other members will go to bed.

1258
00:44:50,033 --> 00:44:51,913
- Let's get some sleep.
- That was crazy. Nice.

1259
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:56,143
Viewers, we're finally leaving for Dokdo.

1260
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:59,983
We will complete the night duty without any problems.

1261
00:45:00,243 --> 00:45:01,442
2 Days!

1262
00:45:01,443 --> 00:45:03,052
- 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

1263
00:45:03,053 --> 00:45:06,323
- Let's go to Dokdo!
- Let's go!

1264
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,722
- Great job.
- That was amazing.

1265
00:45:08,723 --> 00:45:10,652
(Now we will head to Dokdo!)

1266
00:45:10,653 --> 00:45:11,823
- This is amazing.
- Right.

1267
00:45:12,423 --> 00:45:20,003
(Tidying up all the things that are on the land)

1268
00:45:20,663 --> 00:45:26,343
(Everyone is finishing up the preparation for the departure.)

1269
00:45:27,003 --> 00:45:30,813
(The ship drifts away from the land slowly.)

1270
00:45:31,573 --> 00:45:35,313
(We'll get going now.)

1271
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:39,252
(Vessel 3017...)

1272
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:42,393
(of the East Regional Headquarters Korea Coast Guard departs!)

1273
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:44,422
This is really nice.

1274
00:45:44,423 --> 00:45:45,493
It's the best.

1275
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:47,293
It's so nice.

1276
00:45:47,763 --> 00:45:49,863
- Oh, it's nice.
- It's really nice.

1277
00:45:50,433 --> 00:45:51,433
It's great.

1278
00:45:51,434 --> 00:45:53,309
(The real bedroom for the officers working in the vessel)

1279
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,372
Gosh, my back. My back hurts.

1280
00:45:55,373 --> 00:45:57,232
- My back hurts too.
- It feels so refreshing.

1281
00:45:57,233 --> 00:45:58,302
(Se Yoon, who's on a 3-day trip, lies down right away.)

1282
00:45:58,303 --> 00:45:59,303
It's so refreshing.

1283
00:46:00,473 --> 00:46:02,572
(Seon Ho gets into the bottom bunk.)

1284
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:04,243
This is nice. I'm happy.

1285
00:46:04,613 --> 00:46:06,043
I want to sleep with you.

1286
00:46:06,913 --> 00:46:09,182
(Joon and DinDin changed into uniforms for the night duty.)

1287
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,313
Hey, you look good in it.

1288
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:12,583
Joon, you seem reliable.

1289
00:46:12,823 --> 00:46:15,322
I feel relieved, thinking you guard the sea.

1290
00:46:15,323 --> 00:46:17,853
You see... I don't know about DinDin.

1291
00:46:18,053 --> 00:46:19,323
But Joon, you do seem reliable.

1292
00:46:19,923 --> 00:46:22,963
- Good luck with your night shift.
- Sleep well. We'll guard the sea.

1293
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:25,063
- Thank you.
- Constable Lee Joon.

1294
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,873
- Do your best to guard the country.
- I will.

1295
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:29,972
- Sleep well.
- Do your best to guard the sea.

1296
00:46:29,973 --> 00:46:30,973
Got it.

1297
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:33,873
2 Days 1 Night.

1298
00:46:34,903 --> 00:46:36,742
- At ease.
- You can rest up now.

1299
00:46:36,743 --> 00:46:37,743
If you...

1300
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,813
have night snacks, send me a message.

1301
00:46:41,283 --> 00:46:42,483
You don't get a signal here.

1302
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:44,152
Come here and tell me.

1303
00:46:44,153 --> 00:46:46,193
(They leave while the other members cheer them on.)

1304
00:46:46,253 --> 00:46:50,323
(What will the members on night duty do?)

1305
00:46:50,723 --> 00:46:51,992
Oh, my. What place is this?

1306
00:46:51,993 --> 00:46:54,122
(Joon arrived at the place where he'll work.)

1307
00:46:54,123 --> 00:46:56,333
- What place is this? Hello.
- Oh, welcome. Hello.

1308
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:57,692
(Joon will work the night shift at the engine room.)

1309
00:46:57,693 --> 00:46:59,163
- Hello.
- Hello.

1310
00:47:00,103 --> 00:47:02,202
- You look great in the uniform.
- Hello. Oh, thank you.

1311
00:47:02,203 --> 00:47:03,432
- You look great in it.
- Indeed.

1312
00:47:03,433 --> 00:47:07,203
- Thank you. Yes.
- This is the engine room.

1313
00:47:07,373 --> 00:47:10,972
- We say, "The engine is the heart."
- I see.

1314
00:47:10,973 --> 00:47:14,112
The engine room plays the most important role in a vessel.

1315
00:47:14,113 --> 00:47:15,113
(The power sources of the vessel are centralized in the engine room.)

1316
00:47:15,114 --> 00:47:17,512
- We operate the engine...
- Yes.

1317
00:47:17,513 --> 00:47:20,422
Using various alarms and monitors.

1318
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:23,092
We also check all the equipment in the engine room.

1319
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:24,993
The engine room contains various systems.

1320
00:47:25,563 --> 00:47:27,993
I understand. What are my responsibilities here?

1321
00:47:28,063 --> 00:47:31,332
Wear gloves and ear protection and take the flashlight...

1322
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:34,203
- to go on a patrol.
- Understood.

1323
00:47:34,263 --> 00:47:35,702
- Shall we go together?
- Yes.

1324
00:47:35,703 --> 00:47:37,973
(After wearing protective gear, they go on a patrol!)

1325
00:47:39,003 --> 00:47:42,943
(The equipment in the engine room causes high levels of noises.)

1326
00:47:43,513 --> 00:47:45,712
(Look with your eyes.)

1327
00:47:45,713 --> 00:47:46,843
Pardon me?

1328
00:47:48,043 --> 00:47:50,613
(Suddenly, Scream in Silence game begins.)

1329
00:47:51,013 --> 00:47:52,022
(With your eyes)

1330
00:47:52,023 --> 00:47:53,382
(What should I see with my eyes?)

1331
00:47:53,383 --> 00:47:55,183
(Look at everything with your eyes.)

1332
00:47:57,853 --> 00:48:00,293
(He failed to read her signal.)

1333
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:05,703
(He starts the work, trying to do as his senior does.)

1334
00:48:08,573 --> 00:48:11,213
(He can see the spot to be checked, following her hand movements.)

1335
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:13,002
(The engine room work log)

1336
00:48:13,003 --> 00:48:15,043
(Check if oil leaks on machine joints.)

1337
00:48:15,613 --> 00:48:17,772
(This time, they check another machine.)

1338
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:21,183
(40°C)

1339
00:48:22,453 --> 00:48:23,483
Why is that an issue?

1340
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:26,282
It means that the oil temperature is in the normal range.

1341
00:48:26,283 --> 00:48:27,352
(Check the oil temperature and the pressure.)

1342
00:48:27,353 --> 00:48:28,899
- The oil temperature is normal.
- Yes.

1343
00:48:28,923 --> 00:48:30,123
It's in the normal range.

1344
00:48:30,293 --> 00:48:32,622
You should check the pressure by monitoring this gauge.

1345
00:48:32,623 --> 00:48:34,863
- Checking the pressure.
- It's in the normal range too.

1346
00:48:36,693 --> 00:48:37,863
It's working fine.

1347
00:48:38,903 --> 00:48:44,473
(They check everything thoroughly.)

1348
00:48:45,443 --> 00:48:51,542
(The engine room patrol is over.)

1349
00:48:51,543 --> 00:48:53,882
- It's like "Family Entertainment."
- Right.

1350
00:48:53,883 --> 00:48:55,313
I had to read her lips.

1351
00:48:55,813 --> 00:48:57,052
- It felt like a game on the show...
- Right?

1352
00:48:57,053 --> 00:48:58,922
When I was a trainee.

1353
00:48:58,923 --> 00:49:00,382
I was just like you back then.

1354
00:49:00,383 --> 00:49:01,682
It's very noisy in the engine room.

1355
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:03,723
It was so loud that I couldn't even think clearly.

1356
00:49:04,323 --> 00:49:06,263
I couldn't hear her at all.

1357
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:09,592
Oh, my. It's so dark in here.

1358
00:49:09,593 --> 00:49:11,263
(DinDin arrives at a dark place?)

1359
00:49:11,863 --> 00:49:13,662
(DinDin will work at the pilothouse.)

1360
00:49:13,663 --> 00:49:14,833
- Hello.
- Hello.

1361
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:18,472
(Constable Cho Min Ji welcomes DinDin gladly.)

1362
00:49:18,473 --> 00:49:21,273
Why does it have to be so dark in here?

1363
00:49:21,473 --> 00:49:25,143
If it's bright in here, we can't see the outside clearly.

1364
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:31,653
(The lights were turned on before the vessel departed.)

1365
00:49:32,823 --> 00:49:33,983
Can you see anything?

1366
00:49:34,353 --> 00:49:35,423
I can't see anything.

1367
00:49:35,593 --> 00:49:36,593
Exactly. My goodness.

1368
00:49:37,093 --> 00:49:41,663
We use GPS like when we drive a car.

1369
00:49:42,033 --> 00:49:44,693
We use GPS and the radar, which you can see over there,

1370
00:49:44,893 --> 00:49:48,562
to check if there are ships or rocks around this vessel.

1371
00:49:48,563 --> 00:49:51,273
This system can detect physical objects.

1372
00:49:52,403 --> 00:49:53,843
Until what time do you work?

1373
00:49:54,003 --> 00:49:55,842
A night shift...

1374
00:49:55,843 --> 00:49:58,682
starts at midnight and ends at 4am. It goes on for 4 hours.

1375
00:49:58,683 --> 00:50:01,282
- You take turns like a night watch.
- Yes.

1376
00:50:01,283 --> 00:50:02,452
You have to come out while sleeping.

1377
00:50:02,453 --> 00:50:05,083
- How many shifts in a day?
- We work in three shifts.

1378
00:50:05,683 --> 00:50:07,983
I guess you don't have much time to rest.

1379
00:50:08,953 --> 00:50:10,953
(While they're talking, the phone rings suddenly.)

1380
00:50:10,993 --> 00:50:12,563
(Is everything okay?)

1381
00:50:12,923 --> 00:50:14,869
We communicate with the officers in the engine room.

1382
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:16,769
For example, we let them know we'll use the engine.

1383
00:50:16,793 --> 00:50:19,063
(Fascinated)

1384
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:21,033
Yes, we'll increase it to 650 RPM.

1385
00:50:22,003 --> 00:50:23,902
You can stay there and try to adjust the speed.

1386
00:50:23,903 --> 00:50:26,573
- You can try to increase it.
- Try it.

1387
00:50:27,073 --> 00:50:28,542
- Check the speed here.
- What's the speed now?

1388
00:50:28,543 --> 00:50:30,712
It's 557 RPM now, as you can see. Push it gently.

1389
00:50:30,713 --> 00:50:32,512
- So it should be...
- Increase it to 650 RPM. Gently.

1390
00:50:32,513 --> 00:50:33,559
(It's an important task to adjust the speed of the vessel.)

1391
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:35,042
I will increase the speed.

1392
00:50:35,043 --> 00:50:36,843
(He repeats what he is to do loud and clear.)

1393
00:50:37,053 --> 00:50:39,252
- Is it to increase the speed?
- Correct.

1394
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:40,693
(DinDin calmly increases the speed.)

1395
00:50:40,723 --> 00:50:42,093
It's 650 RPM now.

1396
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:44,153
It's 650 RPM now.

1397
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:47,163
- You did a good job.
- I adjusted it to 650 RPM.

1398
00:50:48,163 --> 00:50:50,632
(DinDin adjusted it to the assigned speed accurately.)

1399
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:51,962
- You're quite good at it.
- Thank you.

1400
00:50:51,963 --> 00:50:53,732
I tapped it gently to adjust it accurately.

1401
00:50:53,733 --> 00:50:55,039
(He completed his first task without a hitch.)

1402
00:50:55,063 --> 00:50:56,702
Oh, my. It feels strange.

1403
00:50:56,703 --> 00:50:59,303
It's like pressing the accelerator in a car.

1404
00:51:00,473 --> 00:51:01,772
- My gosh. It's so scary.
- How should I go up?

1405
00:51:01,773 --> 00:51:02,893
Hey, don't do that. My gosh.

1406
00:51:03,573 --> 00:51:04,943
Stop. It might fall.

1407
00:51:05,513 --> 00:51:07,342
(Climbing up)

1408
00:51:07,343 --> 00:51:09,283
Goodness. He went up to the top bunk.

1409
00:51:09,383 --> 00:51:11,883
- The bed must be bent now.
- You bent the bed.

1410
00:51:12,123 --> 00:51:14,152
- You're lying.
- It's true.

1411
00:51:14,153 --> 00:51:16,292
- I see it in the mirror. It's bent.
- It's bent now.

1412
00:51:16,293 --> 00:51:18,722
- Stop lying.
- It's true. It's sunken.

1413
00:51:18,723 --> 00:51:20,662
Sae Ho, you're my friend, so tell me the truth.

1414
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:22,292
- It's bent.
- Okay. I'll go down.

1415
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:23,963
(He's convinced right away.)

1416
00:51:24,263 --> 00:51:26,539
(You should never have gone up there in the first place.)

1417
00:51:26,563 --> 00:51:27,763
Shall I sleep on the top bunk?

1418
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,572
- Go ahead.
- It'll be hard for them...

1419
00:51:30,573 --> 00:51:32,293
to go up on the top bunk when they're back.

1420
00:51:32,473 --> 00:51:34,749
Shall I sleep on the top bunk so they can sleep comfortably?

1421
00:51:34,773 --> 00:51:37,612
That'd be nice of you. Then I'll sleep on the floor.

1422
00:51:37,613 --> 00:51:39,389
(Sae Ho will sleep on the top bunk for the members on the night duty.)

1423
00:51:39,413 --> 00:51:40,642
Se Yoon, please turn the light off.

1424
00:51:40,643 --> 00:51:41,643
(It's time to end their day which has been a long day.)

1425
00:51:41,644 --> 00:51:45,683
As of now, I will turn off the light in the room...

1426
00:51:46,453 --> 00:51:49,223
of the 2 Days 1 Night team on the coast guard's vessel.

1427
00:51:49,593 --> 00:51:50,593
Police.

1428
00:51:50,594 --> 00:51:53,763
(He salutes loud and clear before turning the light off.)

1429
00:51:54,523 --> 00:51:56,892
- What?
- Oh, it's not bad.

1430
00:51:56,893 --> 00:51:58,533
(Lights off)

1431
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:01,833
- Can you hear the waves?
- Yes.

1432
00:52:03,433 --> 00:52:05,279
It's shaking less than the cruise ship did yesterday.

1433
00:52:05,303 --> 00:52:06,903
- Really?
- Yes.

1434
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:08,379
But you can feel the motion, right?

1435
00:52:08,403 --> 00:52:11,642
Definitely. It's swaying to the sides, and it's tilted.

1436
00:52:11,643 --> 00:52:13,603
- It's swaying gently.
- It's tilted to one side.

1437
00:52:14,943 --> 00:52:16,303
This room is quite clean and nice.

1438
00:52:16,653 --> 00:52:17,812
(Listening to the waves, they sleep in an unfamiliar, special place.)

1439
00:52:17,813 --> 00:52:18,883
Good night, guys.

1440
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,053
Sleep well.

1441
00:52:23,953 --> 00:52:28,293
(They fall asleep while imagining Dokdo they'll see soon.)

1442
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:31,762
We actually monitor what happens in this room...

1443
00:52:31,763 --> 00:52:33,863
during a night shift.

1444
00:52:34,503 --> 00:52:38,603
Sir, may I ask how long you've been working here?

1445
00:52:39,003 --> 00:52:42,512
I've been working here for almost 27 years.

1446
00:52:42,513 --> 00:52:44,342
For 27 years? Hold on. That's amazing.

1447
00:52:44,343 --> 00:52:46,063
(He's been working here for 27 long years.)

1448
00:52:46,213 --> 00:52:47,642
I'll be retiring soon.

1449
00:52:47,643 --> 00:52:48,853
- Really?
- Yes.

1450
00:52:49,313 --> 00:52:51,512
While working this job,

1451
00:52:51,513 --> 00:52:53,223
you must've experienced a lot.

1452
00:52:54,353 --> 00:52:56,753
Yes, I've seen a lot of accidents as well.

1453
00:52:57,053 --> 00:52:58,452
- Accidents?
- Yes.

1454
00:52:58,453 --> 00:53:00,693
Accidents that damaged equipment or caused casualties.

1455
00:53:01,023 --> 00:53:02,193
Exactly.

1456
00:53:02,663 --> 00:53:05,433
I've come this far, going through a lot.

1457
00:53:05,493 --> 00:53:07,502
You must've gained skills and knowledge from your experience.

1458
00:53:07,503 --> 00:53:11,633
But there must've been a lot of difficulties as well.

1459
00:53:12,303 --> 00:53:14,042
You're amazing. It's not easy...

1460
00:53:14,043 --> 00:53:15,713
That's our duty.

1461
00:53:17,513 --> 00:53:19,212
Because I've been working here, I got lucky...

1462
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:21,112
and got to meet a top star like you.

1463
00:53:21,113 --> 00:53:22,113
I'm flattered.

1464
00:53:22,114 --> 00:53:23,913
Goodness, I'm just...

1465
00:53:24,253 --> 00:53:25,782
I'm just a kid who dropped by.

1466
00:53:25,783 --> 00:53:26,822
(It's my honor.)

1467
00:53:26,823 --> 00:53:30,222
Working for 27 years for the same job...

1468
00:53:30,223 --> 00:53:33,323
This is incredible, isn't it?

1469
00:53:34,093 --> 00:53:37,362
You still have to go out to the sea even when the weather is bad.

1470
00:53:37,363 --> 00:53:39,033
- That's right.
- How do you handle it?

1471
00:53:39,103 --> 00:53:40,663
When the weather is bad,

1472
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:42,902
- It must be tough.
- it really is hectic.

1473
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:46,142
I can't even stand properly because I lose balance.

1474
00:53:46,143 --> 00:53:48,772
- You get swayed like this?
- Yes, it gets that extreme.

1475
00:53:48,773 --> 00:53:50,372
- My body gets bent over.
- Right.

1476
00:53:50,373 --> 00:53:53,343
- So you keep rocking then.
- Right.

1477
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:55,723
- You sleep like that too?
- Yes, in the same condition.

1478
00:53:55,953 --> 00:53:57,052
My goodness.

1479
00:53:57,053 --> 00:53:59,882
Some people fall down while sleeping on the bunk beds.

1480
00:53:59,883 --> 00:54:01,563
- When the weather is bad?
- That's right.

1481
00:54:02,423 --> 00:54:04,123
That must be really tough.

1482
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:07,962
(Even in harsh weather and challenging working conditions, )

1483
00:54:07,963 --> 00:54:10,433
(the Coast Guard silently stands and watches over the sea.)

1484
00:54:10,863 --> 00:54:12,162
(And the important task of...)

1485
00:54:12,163 --> 00:54:13,462
(the East Regional Headquarters Korea Coast Guard)

1486
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:14,463
(Protecting Dokdo)

1487
00:54:14,464 --> 00:54:17,173
I thought only the coastal guards protect the island.

1488
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:21,143
Here's the most important thing about protecting Dokdo.

1489
00:54:21,243 --> 00:54:23,072
We have to stay alert to the Japan Coast Guard.

1490
00:54:23,073 --> 00:54:24,612
- They have this patrol boat.
- Right.

1491
00:54:24,613 --> 00:54:26,782
They come up to our area every ten days or so.

1492
00:54:26,783 --> 00:54:28,982
It comes towards Dokdo at a very fast speed.

1493
00:54:28,983 --> 00:54:30,383
Why? Why do they do that?

1494
00:54:30,453 --> 00:54:33,423
They want to insist that Dokdo belongs to Japan.

1495
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:35,752
- They just want to insist...
- They want to show...

1496
00:54:35,753 --> 00:54:38,252
- Right.
- We make sure they don't get...

1497
00:54:38,253 --> 00:54:39,763
any closer to Dokdo.

1498
00:54:40,293 --> 00:54:42,632
We get really close to the boat so that they don't approach us.

1499
00:54:42,633 --> 00:54:43,633
(Close maneuvers to prevent Japanese patrol ships from approaching)

1500
00:54:43,634 --> 00:54:45,593
- That's how it works.
- Do they leave soon?

1501
00:54:46,133 --> 00:54:47,632
They just go after taking a few rounds.

1502
00:54:47,633 --> 00:54:49,202
That means...

1503
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,133
they can't approach us because you're protecting it.

1504
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:56,543
They can't come closer to the island.

1505
00:54:56,913 --> 00:54:58,212
That means the island belongs to us.

1506
00:54:58,213 --> 00:55:00,442
Right, it belongs to us. That's why we always...

1507
00:55:00,443 --> 00:55:01,642
We're protecting it.

1508
00:55:01,643 --> 00:55:04,513
We never leave Dokdo alone.

1509
00:55:04,853 --> 00:55:06,452
There is always at least one boat of Korea Coast Guard...

1510
00:55:06,453 --> 00:55:08,022
that protects the island throughout the year.

1511
00:55:08,023 --> 00:55:09,293
- Is that so?
- Right.

1512
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:12,423
You guys work really hard.

1513
00:55:12,863 --> 00:55:15,123
This is why we are here.

1514
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:19,263
- We protect our territory.
- That's amazing.

1515
00:55:20,903 --> 00:55:24,472
(The Coast Guard tirelessly protects our seas day and night...)

1516
00:55:24,473 --> 00:55:28,243
(to safeguard Korea's maritime sovereignty.)

1517
00:55:28,803 --> 00:55:30,942
(Expressing sincere gratitude to the Coast Guard officers...)

1518
00:55:30,943 --> 00:55:33,043
(who are protecting Dokdo even at this very moment)

1519
00:55:33,643 --> 00:55:35,142
Could you take over my shift?

1520
00:55:35,143 --> 00:55:36,782
(Duty shift is over at 4am.)

1521
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:37,913
It's 120 degrees.

1522
00:55:38,453 --> 00:55:40,153
You guys work really hard.

1523
00:55:40,723 --> 00:55:42,622
Aren't you hungry?

1524
00:55:42,623 --> 00:55:44,463
(They got hungry because they worked so hard.)

1525
00:55:44,493 --> 00:55:46,462
I'm hungry, I need late-night snacks.

1526
00:55:46,463 --> 00:55:48,593
(Finally, it's time to have late-night snacks.)

1527
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:51,192
- Here is your ramyeon.
- It's huge.

1528
00:55:51,193 --> 00:55:52,263
Is it heavy?

1529
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:56,802
- Let's eat.
- This looks so good.

1530
00:55:56,803 --> 00:55:57,933
What did you put in there?

1531
00:55:58,033 --> 00:56:00,273
- It just looks amazing.
- It has cabbage. Please start.

1532
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:02,512
It smells amazing.

1533
00:56:02,513 --> 00:56:03,912
(Special ramyeon with cabbage)

1534
00:56:03,913 --> 00:56:05,742
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy.

1535
00:56:05,743 --> 00:56:07,283
What did you put in here?

1536
00:56:08,343 --> 00:56:10,852
The late-night snack vibe is amazing.

1537
00:56:10,853 --> 00:56:12,699
(Smelling the ramyeon melts their fatigue away.)

1538
00:56:12,723 --> 00:56:13,882
You added all the ingredients.

1539
00:56:13,883 --> 00:56:16,293
(Slurping)

1540
00:56:16,823 --> 00:56:19,092
Gosh, this ramyeon is so good.

1541
00:56:19,093 --> 00:56:20,093
(Very satisfied)

1542
00:56:20,094 --> 00:56:22,254
- Gosh, it's hot.
- I can literally have it every day.

1543
00:56:22,693 --> 00:56:24,062
The spiciness is okay, right?

1544
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,439
(DinDin who worked hard is also slurping the noodles.)

1545
00:56:25,463 --> 00:56:29,333
How is this different from the usual ones you have?

1546
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:31,903
I added a lot of cabbage.

1547
00:56:32,073 --> 00:56:34,643
- Cabbage has this sweetness.
- Right.

1548
00:56:35,203 --> 00:56:38,313
The cabbage helps remove the garlic flavors.

1549
00:56:38,443 --> 00:56:39,443
And it has this spiciness too.

1550
00:56:39,443 --> 00:56:40,443
(No wonder it tastes so good.)

1551
00:56:40,444 --> 00:56:42,552
Gosh, now that we're eating...

1552
00:56:42,553 --> 00:56:44,913
- I feel we're lucky to be here.
- Right.

1553
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,383
This is so delicious.

1554
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:49,529
- I'm glad you like it.
- It's so good.

1555
00:56:49,553 --> 00:56:51,452
- Please have some more.
- Enjoy.

1556
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:52,792
(A satisfying late-night snack for everyone)

1557
00:56:52,793 --> 00:56:54,223
This is delicious.

1558
00:56:54,423 --> 00:56:57,033
It tastes even better after taking your shifts.

1559
00:56:57,933 --> 00:56:59,563
So I heard...

1560
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:02,902
that the sea waves were strong during autumn and winter.

1561
00:57:02,903 --> 00:57:05,032
- I know, the waves are so strong.
- You can't have this then.

1562
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:06,602
- No, we can't.
- The vessel must sway a lot.

1563
00:57:06,603 --> 00:57:07,972
- Yes. It sways a lot.
- Right.

1564
00:57:07,973 --> 00:57:09,512
All the utensils fall.

1565
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:10,843
Then how do you eat?

1566
00:57:11,243 --> 00:57:13,312
We do get to eat.

1567
00:57:13,313 --> 00:57:14,713
- You eat like this?
- Right.

1568
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:18,013
- We get swayed when we lie down.
- You'll have an upset stomach.

1569
00:57:18,713 --> 00:57:21,382
How long have you been working like that?

1570
00:57:21,383 --> 00:57:22,892
- About a year and six months.
- About a year.

1571
00:57:22,893 --> 00:57:24,752
- A year and 6 months?
- A year and 6 months.

1572
00:57:24,753 --> 00:57:25,753
(Bo Geum and Min Ji have been working for 1 year and 6 months.)

1573
00:57:25,754 --> 00:57:27,623
It must have been tough in the beginning.

1574
00:57:27,893 --> 00:57:30,962
I heard that you were married. What does your husband do?

1575
00:57:30,963 --> 00:57:33,302
He and I are from the same academy.

1576
00:57:33,303 --> 00:57:35,132
- Is he here now?
- No, he isn't here.

1577
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:36,433
He's on another vessel.

1578
00:57:37,003 --> 00:57:38,803
- He's also an officer.
- That means...

1579
00:57:39,003 --> 00:57:40,402
What happens if you two can't meet your schedules?

1580
00:57:40,403 --> 00:57:41,842
- We don't get to see each other.
- Really?

1581
00:57:41,843 --> 00:57:43,712
So it must take months to see each other then.

1582
00:57:43,713 --> 00:57:44,772
No.

1583
00:57:44,773 --> 00:57:47,882
We saw each other for 12 hours in September.

1584
00:57:47,883 --> 00:57:48,942
- You saw each other for 12 hours?
- Right.

1585
00:57:48,943 --> 00:57:50,612
We saw each other for 12 hours because of our shifts.

1586
00:57:50,613 --> 00:57:52,352
- In one single month of September.
- Right.

1587
00:57:52,353 --> 00:57:54,193
- You saw him for 12 hours?
- Right, 12 hours.

1588
00:57:54,483 --> 00:57:56,492
That is so tough.

1589
00:57:56,493 --> 00:57:57,493
(They all work so hard.)

1590
00:57:57,494 --> 00:57:59,992
So how long has it been for you two to have such shift schedules?

1591
00:57:59,993 --> 00:58:02,992
We have been on board last year and this year.

1592
00:58:02,993 --> 00:58:04,292
It has been a year and six months.

1593
00:58:04,293 --> 00:58:06,732
So you couldn't see him a lot then.

1594
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,802
So throughout a month, I only get to see him for less than seven days.

1595
00:58:09,803 --> 00:58:10,973
You must miss him a lot.

1596
00:58:11,503 --> 00:58:12,842
I can't really remember his face.

1597
00:58:12,843 --> 00:58:13,973
You can't remember his face?

1598
00:58:14,103 --> 00:58:16,412
- But I think she's right.
- You meant it, right?

1599
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:18,272
- I really don't...
- My goodness.

1600
00:58:18,273 --> 00:58:19,612
Do you want to send him a video message?

1601
00:58:19,613 --> 00:58:23,482
"Are you seeing this? Officer Park, are you protecting the island?"

1602
00:58:23,483 --> 00:58:24,582
This is awkward.

1603
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:26,483
Just send him. Come on!

1604
00:58:26,553 --> 00:58:27,752
Was it really tasty?

1605
00:58:27,753 --> 00:58:29,552
- It was good.
- Really?

1606
00:58:29,553 --> 00:58:31,652
I was about to get hungry.

1607
00:58:31,653 --> 00:58:33,862
- It was so delicious.
- I'm glad you liked it.

1608
00:58:33,863 --> 00:58:35,192
It touched my heart.

1609
00:58:35,193 --> 00:58:36,332
(Feeling happy)

1610
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:37,992
We'll do the dishes.

1611
00:58:37,993 --> 00:58:39,362
- You can leave now.
- You cooked for us.

1612
00:58:39,363 --> 00:58:40,562
(Thoroughly washing the dishes)

1613
00:58:40,563 --> 00:58:41,733
It's all set.

1614
00:58:43,873 --> 00:58:47,603
(Joon and DinDin's night shift is over.)

1615
00:58:48,043 --> 00:58:51,913
(Vessel 3017 continues to approach towards Dokdo.)

1616
00:58:52,813 --> 00:58:57,413
(Faintly visible Dokdo)

1617
00:58:57,913 --> 00:59:00,653
(It's time for them to wake up at 5:30am.)

1618
00:59:01,383 --> 00:59:04,153
(They're still soundly asleep.)

1619
00:59:05,323 --> 00:59:06,463
Everyone...

1620
00:59:08,063 --> 00:59:09,332
(Sae Ho getting up)

1621
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,293
- It's time to get up.
- Okay.

1622
00:59:11,463 --> 00:59:12,862
How's the weather?

1623
00:59:12,863 --> 00:59:15,762
Luckily, the weather is nice.

1624
00:59:15,763 --> 00:59:17,333
- Really?
- Yes.

1625
00:59:18,273 --> 00:59:19,403
What's happening?

1626
00:59:19,743 --> 00:59:20,843
You have to get up now.

1627
00:59:22,713 --> 00:59:23,942
I'll turn on the lights.

1628
00:59:23,943 --> 00:59:26,442
(Turning the lights on to wake them up)

1629
00:59:26,443 --> 00:59:27,742
It's 5:30am already.

1630
00:59:27,743 --> 00:59:28,882
(Checking the time now)

1631
00:59:28,883 --> 00:59:31,683
- Let's get up.
- Se Yoon, get up.

1632
00:59:33,553 --> 00:59:34,553
Joon.

1633
00:59:34,653 --> 00:59:36,892
(Quickly waking the others too)

1634
00:59:36,893 --> 00:59:38,052
Jong Min.

1635
00:59:38,053 --> 00:59:40,393
(He went back to his bed.)

1636
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:43,032
The weather is nice, you'll be surprised when you get to the deck.

1637
00:59:43,033 --> 00:59:44,163
- Really?
- Yes.

1638
00:59:45,093 --> 00:59:48,063
(Is there anything that would surprise them on the deck?)

1639
00:59:52,003 --> 00:59:54,143
- It's so pretty.
- Good morning.

1640
00:59:56,573 --> 00:59:58,053
Goodness, let's take a video of that.

1641
00:59:58,373 --> 01:00:00,042
- Gosh, the dawn has...
- It's so pretty.

1642
01:00:00,043 --> 01:00:01,783
(Did he spot something?)

1643
01:00:04,003 --> 01:00:05,483
Goodness, let's take a video of that.

1644
01:00:06,143 --> 01:00:07,412
- Gosh, the dawn has...
- It's so pretty.

1645
01:00:07,413 --> 01:00:09,042
(Did he spot something?)

1646
01:00:09,043 --> 01:00:10,143
The view is amazing.

1647
01:00:10,413 --> 01:00:11,612
Gosh, it's so pretty.

1648
01:00:11,613 --> 01:00:13,513
(Finally, it's showing...)

1649
01:00:14,553 --> 01:00:15,623
This is crazy.

1650
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:17,322
(The final destination of their trip, Dokdo)

1651
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:18,453
Is that Dokdo?

1652
01:00:19,053 --> 01:00:21,222
- Is that Dokdo?
- What you see over there...

1653
01:00:21,223 --> 01:00:24,462
is Korea's easternmost island, Dokdo.

1654
01:00:24,463 --> 01:00:26,963
(An island that protects the easternmost area of Korea)

1655
01:00:27,463 --> 01:00:30,532
The place on the Korean Peninsula where the sun rises first.

1656
01:00:30,533 --> 01:00:32,702
- My gosh, it's pretty.
- I'll take a photo with the island.

1657
01:00:32,703 --> 01:00:34,079
(The place on the Korean Peninsula where the sun rises first)

1658
01:00:34,103 --> 01:00:35,202
It's splendid.

1659
01:00:35,203 --> 01:00:38,942
(A sense of mystery in harmony with the first light before dawn)

1660
01:00:38,943 --> 01:00:40,073
It's marvelous.

1661
01:00:40,443 --> 01:00:41,613
Gosh, it's so pretty.

1662
01:00:46,283 --> 01:00:48,223
- It's very touching.
- I know, it's touching.

1663
01:00:49,323 --> 01:00:50,783
- First time visiting Dokdo?
- Yes.

1664
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,393
It's magnificent.

1665
01:00:53,493 --> 01:00:55,062
Dokdo is incredible.

1666
01:00:55,063 --> 01:00:56,422
Yes, it is.

1667
01:00:56,423 --> 01:01:00,033
It's my first time visiting there at this hour. It's amazing.

1668
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,932
(The breathtaking scenery of the easternmost tip...)

1669
01:01:03,933 --> 01:01:06,333
(gradually revealing its beauty)

1670
01:01:06,573 --> 01:01:09,602
This place gives me mixed feelings.

1671
01:01:09,603 --> 01:01:10,603
(For the first-time visitors...)

1672
01:01:10,604 --> 01:01:11,642
(as well as the visitors who visited here before)

1673
01:01:11,643 --> 01:01:13,043
It's like someone painted that.

1674
01:01:14,273 --> 01:01:16,382
- It's wonderful.
- I know.

1675
01:01:16,383 --> 01:01:18,282
(They all can't take their eyes off the island.)

1676
01:01:18,283 --> 01:01:20,683
It's a very precious video.

1677
01:01:21,953 --> 01:01:23,983
Yes, it's an amazing video.

1678
01:01:25,453 --> 01:01:26,853
It's beyond being beautiful.

1679
01:01:27,493 --> 01:01:28,993
It just feels different.

1680
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:31,533
You two, please turn around.

1681
01:01:34,063 --> 01:01:37,302
The island will be in between you two. There you go.

1682
01:01:37,303 --> 01:01:38,402
(They're taking pictures to cherish this honorable moment.)

1683
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,473
Okay.

1684
01:01:40,533 --> 01:01:41,973
One, two, three.

1685
01:01:50,713 --> 01:01:55,423
(The unforgettable first glimpse of Dokdo)

1686
01:01:56,383 --> 01:01:59,122
(Meanwhile, )

1687
01:01:59,123 --> 01:02:00,452
(the darkness clears.)

1688
01:02:00,453 --> 01:02:01,963
The sun is about to rise soon.

1689
01:02:03,663 --> 01:02:06,033
- It's rising up.
- It is.

1690
01:02:06,693 --> 01:02:08,702
- Gosh.
- It's rising up.

1691
01:02:08,703 --> 01:02:10,363
(Impressed)

1692
01:02:12,173 --> 01:02:13,433
It rises up very quickly.

1693
01:02:17,403 --> 01:02:19,372
The sunrise is more beautiful than any other ones.

1694
01:02:19,373 --> 01:02:20,412
(The moment of sunrise at the easternmost point of Korea)

1695
01:02:20,413 --> 01:02:21,913
It rises up very quickly.

1696
01:02:22,143 --> 01:02:23,983
It rises up really quickly.

1697
01:02:24,383 --> 01:02:26,482
It's like the sea is pushing it up.

1698
01:02:26,483 --> 01:02:29,023
That's how quickly it's rising up.

1699
01:02:29,623 --> 01:02:31,269
Is it because this is the easternmost place?

1700
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:33,493
It's rising up really beautifully.

1701
01:02:34,393 --> 01:02:36,592
- It's really red.
- It's refreshing.

1702
01:02:36,593 --> 01:02:39,113
(It's a touching moment they want to remember for a long time.)

1703
01:02:40,163 --> 01:02:43,033
(Let's all take a moment to enjoy the sunrise at Dokdo.)

1704
01:02:56,883 --> 01:02:59,283
How would we ever come here at this hour?

1705
01:03:00,783 --> 01:03:01,882
That's right.

1706
01:03:01,883 --> 01:03:04,993
It's really not easy to watch the sunrise at Dokdo.

1707
01:03:05,123 --> 01:03:06,193
Right.

1708
01:03:07,853 --> 01:03:14,833
(Before the shining sun and the tranquil Dokdo, )

1709
01:03:17,363 --> 01:03:21,903
(everyone feels touched and falls silent in reverence.)

1710
01:03:23,073 --> 01:03:27,013
(The members can't take their eyes off it for a while.)

1711
01:03:28,613 --> 01:03:32,782
The silent sunrise of Dokdo that shone like a jewel.

1712
01:03:32,783 --> 01:03:36,453
(Sae Ho: The silent sunrise of Dokdo that shined like a jewel)

1713
01:03:37,253 --> 01:03:39,152
(It's time to head to Dokdo, )

1714
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:41,023
(the final destination of the great journey.)

1715
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,422
- It's coming up.
- Pull it up.

1716
01:03:43,423 --> 01:03:45,432
(They'll go to Dokdo via a Korea Coast Guard boat.)

1717
01:03:45,433 --> 01:03:46,663
Keep pulling.

1718
01:03:48,633 --> 01:03:50,633
They're pulling up the boat.

1719
01:03:50,763 --> 01:03:51,932
Are they pulling it?

1720
01:03:51,933 --> 01:03:53,433
Pull it up high.

1721
01:03:54,003 --> 01:03:55,103
Keep lifting it.

1722
01:03:56,943 --> 01:03:58,913
It's very high-tech.

1723
01:04:00,913 --> 01:04:02,482
Thank you.

1724
01:04:02,483 --> 01:04:04,142
(Boarding the boat)

1725
01:04:04,143 --> 01:04:05,182
Amazing.

1726
01:04:05,183 --> 01:04:07,282
Amazing.

1727
01:04:07,283 --> 01:04:08,922
(It's their first time going to Dokdo on a patrol boat.)

1728
01:04:08,923 --> 01:04:10,682
- This is a unique experience.
- Right.

1729
01:04:10,683 --> 01:04:11,892
Well done.

1730
01:04:11,893 --> 01:04:13,992
You all look better in person.

1731
01:04:13,993 --> 01:04:16,192
Thank you. Be healthy.

1732
01:04:16,193 --> 01:04:17,293
At this hour.

1733
01:04:21,193 --> 01:04:23,632
(They're also getting on the boat on the other side.)

1734
01:04:23,633 --> 01:04:25,772
It's all written at the front.

1735
01:04:25,773 --> 01:04:27,273
That's the setting.

1736
01:04:27,703 --> 01:04:28,972
(It's going down.)

1737
01:04:28,973 --> 01:04:30,702
It's like an amusement ride.

1738
01:04:30,703 --> 01:04:31,913
(It's fascinating.)

1739
01:04:32,973 --> 01:04:35,943
(They safely reach the sea.)

1740
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:38,782
- Bye.
- Bye.

1741
01:04:38,783 --> 01:04:40,712
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1742
01:04:40,713 --> 01:04:42,882
- Bye!
- Bye.

1743
01:04:42,883 --> 01:04:44,243
(They don't forget to thank them.)

1744
01:04:44,323 --> 01:04:47,453
- This feels interesting.
- It's touching.

1745
01:04:48,163 --> 01:04:49,622
(The water is rougher than they thought.)

1746
01:04:49,623 --> 01:04:54,293
How did people come out to such a sea to fish in the Joseon era?

1747
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,332
- I know.
- That's right.

1748
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:57,933
It's amazing.

1749
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,772
This is how it feels.

1750
01:04:59,773 --> 01:05:03,543
(They finally head to Dokdo.)

1751
01:05:05,273 --> 01:05:07,112
We're getting to go to Dokdo.

1752
01:05:07,113 --> 01:05:08,413
It feels weird.

1753
01:05:10,713 --> 01:05:12,682
This is amazing.

1754
01:05:12,683 --> 01:05:14,113
It's really incredible.

1755
01:05:17,553 --> 01:05:20,893
(Standing tall in the middle of the East Sea)

1756
01:05:21,623 --> 01:05:25,493
(Dokdo, territory of South Korea)

1757
01:05:26,393 --> 01:05:28,302
As dokdo grew closer,

1758
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:30,702
the excitement inside me grew too.

1759
01:05:30,703 --> 01:05:35,773
(DinDin: As dokdo grew closer, the excitement inside me grew too.)

1760
01:05:39,513 --> 01:05:41,913
It makes you clench your fist.

1761
01:05:44,443 --> 01:05:47,583
(It's as if a sense of energy was rising within.)

1762
01:05:48,383 --> 01:05:51,722
(They can't take their eyes...)

1763
01:05:51,723 --> 01:05:54,693
(off Dokdo, our island.)

1764
01:05:59,463 --> 01:06:01,192
(They get splashed with water.)

1765
01:06:01,193 --> 01:06:03,163
Hey.

1766
01:06:03,233 --> 01:06:06,473
(Sae Ho, the biggest victim, is flustered.)

1767
01:06:06,873 --> 01:06:07,932
This...

1768
01:06:07,933 --> 01:06:09,243
(Laughing)

1769
01:06:09,443 --> 01:06:11,083
It feels like we came to do water sports.

1770
01:06:12,073 --> 01:06:13,543
The water suddenly came.

1771
01:06:14,273 --> 01:06:18,513
(Entering Dokdo isn't easy.)

1772
01:06:19,683 --> 01:06:23,623
(It's chaos at Jong Min's boat too.)

1773
01:06:23,883 --> 01:06:26,653
Dokdo... Gosh.

1774
01:06:27,123 --> 01:06:28,123
Goodness!

1775
01:06:28,124 --> 01:06:29,892
We look too ugly to go to Dokdo.

1776
01:06:29,893 --> 01:06:32,293
(They just keep shouting because of the fast speed.)

1777
01:06:33,533 --> 01:06:35,002
(I'm scared.)

1778
01:06:35,003 --> 01:06:36,262
- Dokdo...
- It's over there.

1779
01:06:36,263 --> 01:06:38,473
We're going to Dokdo on a boat.

1780
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:40,632
Look at Dokdo.

1781
01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:43,343
(That's why you have to see Dokdo right now!)

1782
01:06:43,903 --> 01:06:46,812
(Trying his best to look at it.)

1783
01:06:46,813 --> 01:06:47,973
It's amazing.

1784
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:51,713
(They can feel the waves with all their body.)

1785
01:06:52,213 --> 01:06:53,283
Goodness.

1786
01:06:53,813 --> 01:06:55,682
- Along the sea route southeast - Southeast

1787
01:06:55,683 --> 01:06:57,822
(Along the sea route southeast for Ulleung Island for 78km)

1788
01:06:57,823 --> 01:07:00,193
(No, 87K)

1789
01:07:01,423 --> 01:07:05,793
(They naturally sing at the thought of going to Dokdo.)

1790
01:07:05,893 --> 01:07:07,933
No matter how much they claim it as their own

1791
01:07:08,563 --> 01:07:13,303
(Dokdo is our land)

1792
01:07:14,603 --> 01:07:15,942
We circled it once.

1793
01:07:15,943 --> 01:07:18,972
(As they enjoy the scenery...)

1794
01:07:18,973 --> 01:07:20,272
- We circled it once.
- Already?

1795
01:07:20,273 --> 01:07:21,313
Yes.

1796
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:25,253
(Dokdo)

1797
01:07:25,653 --> 01:07:30,583
(Dokdo is right in front of them.)

1798
01:07:32,823 --> 01:07:35,692
(A place that makes you...)

1799
01:07:35,693 --> 01:07:39,593
(just stare silently)

1800
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:41,603
Taegeukgi.

1801
01:07:44,263 --> 01:07:47,773
(The Taegeukgi welcomes them first.)

1802
01:07:48,573 --> 01:07:52,272
(A paradise for seabirds...)

1803
01:07:52,273 --> 01:07:57,183
(and a habitat for countless plants and animals)

1804
01:07:58,383 --> 01:08:01,923
(We came to Korea's easternmost area, Dokdo.)

1805
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:04,353
I really came here.

1806
01:08:05,393 --> 01:08:06,923
It's so beautiful.

1807
01:08:07,653 --> 01:08:10,162
It's like a sculpture.

1808
01:08:10,163 --> 01:08:11,193
Right.

1809
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:21,103
My first visit to Dokdo.

1810
01:08:21,273 --> 01:08:25,243
Up close, it was even more beautiful and touching.

1811
01:08:25,513 --> 01:08:29,213
(Joon: Up close, it was even more beautiful and touching.)

1812
01:08:30,783 --> 01:08:33,083
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1813
01:08:33,783 --> 01:08:35,252
(The members finally set foot on Dokdo.)

1814
01:08:35,253 --> 01:08:36,623
Thank you.

1815
01:08:37,723 --> 01:08:39,152
- It's Dokdo.
- I know, right?

1816
01:08:39,153 --> 01:08:40,953
I just stepped on Dokdo.

1817
01:08:41,793 --> 01:08:43,063
It's Dokdo.

1818
01:08:43,263 --> 01:08:45,262
You have to write a diary today.

1819
01:08:45,263 --> 01:08:46,792
I will write a picture diary today.

1820
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:48,239
(The 2 Days 1 Night team arrived on Dokdo.)

1821
01:08:48,263 --> 01:08:49,602
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1822
01:08:49,603 --> 01:08:50,932
- Stay healthy.
- Thank you.

1823
01:08:50,933 --> 01:08:52,103
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1824
01:08:53,773 --> 01:08:56,643
(They thank them and turn around.)

1825
01:08:57,303 --> 01:08:58,472
Have a good day.

1826
01:08:58,473 --> 01:09:00,043
- Stay healthy.
- Thank you.

1827
01:09:01,613 --> 01:09:03,082
- Professor!
- Welcome!

1828
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:04,643
- What?
- Right.

1829
01:09:06,113 --> 01:09:08,213
(Welcome.)

1830
01:09:08,723 --> 01:09:10,222
When did you get here?

1831
01:09:10,223 --> 01:09:11,823
Of course, I should come.

1832
01:09:11,893 --> 01:09:14,322
Did you sleep on Dokdo?

1833
01:09:14,323 --> 01:09:16,462
- Right.
- Where did you come from?

1834
01:09:16,463 --> 01:09:18,533
I appeared suddenly again.

1835
01:09:19,393 --> 01:09:21,633
(He appeared on Ulleung Island yesterday.)

1836
01:09:21,733 --> 01:09:23,632
Where were you?

1837
01:09:23,633 --> 01:09:25,072
(He appears on Dokdo today.)

1838
01:09:25,073 --> 01:09:27,673
I disappear and appear. This isn't easy.

1839
01:09:28,403 --> 01:09:31,572
- First, to welcome you, - Yes.

1840
01:09:31,573 --> 01:09:32,712
- there's a gift.
- What is this?

1841
01:09:32,713 --> 01:09:34,242
A small gift...

1842
01:09:34,243 --> 01:09:35,713
- was prepared.
- What is this?

1843
01:09:35,883 --> 01:09:37,913
- Is it like a scarf?
- That's right.

1844
01:09:38,013 --> 01:09:40,052
It has the national flag.

1845
01:09:40,053 --> 01:09:41,722
- I want to wear it.
- Is it a scarf?

1846
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:42,783
Yes.

1847
01:09:43,083 --> 01:09:44,982
- There are eared seals!
- There are eared seals.

1848
01:09:44,983 --> 01:09:46,722
- Right.
- The pattern of the Taegeukgi,

1849
01:09:46,723 --> 01:09:48,592
Dokdo, and eared seals.

1850
01:09:48,593 --> 01:09:49,593
(A scarf with the Taegeukgi, Dokdo, and eared seals)

1851
01:09:49,594 --> 01:09:51,662
Thank you.

1852
01:09:51,663 --> 01:09:53,663
You're welcome.

1853
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:56,563
First of all, I'm so glad to have you guys here.

1854
01:09:56,603 --> 01:09:58,602
This place, Dokdo,

1855
01:09:58,603 --> 01:10:00,432
- is a natural monument.
- Yes.

1856
01:10:00,433 --> 01:10:02,503
- That's right.
- It's a natural monument.

1857
01:10:03,303 --> 01:10:06,212
Every corner...

1858
01:10:06,213 --> 01:10:08,683
is a hidden gem and a breathtaking sight.

1859
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,282
It's like it was sculpted.

1860
01:10:10,283 --> 01:10:11,612
- It's like it was sculpted...
- It makes no sense.

1861
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:12,912
By hand.

1862
01:10:12,913 --> 01:10:13,983
Right.

1863
01:10:15,683 --> 01:10:22,223
(A scenery that looks sculpted by someone)

1864
01:10:22,993 --> 01:10:25,832
- We arrived at the dock.
- Yes.

1865
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:27,762
- This is Dongdo.
- Dongdo.

1866
01:10:27,763 --> 01:10:28,832
That's Seodo.

1867
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:30,162
- Yes.
- This is Dongdo, and that's Seodo.

1868
01:10:30,163 --> 01:10:32,003
- That's Seodo.
- The sun rises like this.

1869
01:10:33,003 --> 01:10:34,932
(Dokdo is made up of two islands.)

1870
01:10:34,933 --> 01:10:37,603
(Seodo, Dongdo)

1871
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:42,343
(Only Dongdo is open to the public at present.)

1872
01:10:42,743 --> 01:10:44,712
- I'll give you...
- Yes.

1873
01:10:44,713 --> 01:10:46,012
A great tour...

1874
01:10:46,013 --> 01:10:47,652
- I feel very reassured.
- around this place.

1875
01:10:47,653 --> 01:10:48,722
- All right.
- I'm excited.

1876
01:10:48,723 --> 01:10:50,682
When we came here on our own last time,

1877
01:10:50,683 --> 01:10:52,152
we just went up there,

1878
01:10:52,153 --> 01:10:53,623
- took a look, and came down.
- Yes.

1879
01:10:53,723 --> 01:10:55,763
Now we're going to take a tour with explanations.

1880
01:10:55,823 --> 01:10:57,163
How far up did you go then?

1881
01:10:57,393 --> 01:10:58,892
- Over there.
- We went up there.

1882
01:10:58,893 --> 01:11:00,892
- Up there.
- Up to the Mangyangdae Pavilion.

1883
01:11:00,893 --> 01:11:02,232
- Yes.
- That's right.

1884
01:11:02,233 --> 01:11:03,562
We went to that spot.

1885
01:11:03,563 --> 01:11:04,802
- Today, - Yes.

1886
01:11:04,803 --> 01:11:05,972
We'll head even higher.

1887
01:11:05,973 --> 01:11:07,873
- Really?
- We'll go to the top.

1888
01:11:08,003 --> 01:11:10,442
I'll take you...

1889
01:11:10,443 --> 01:11:12,512
- on a detailed tour...
- I'd love that. We have no time.

1890
01:11:12,513 --> 01:11:14,072
- Yes. Let's hurry.
- of Dokdo today.

1891
01:11:14,073 --> 01:11:15,642
Let's slowly start moving.

1892
01:11:15,643 --> 01:11:16,882
- Okay.
- This is great.

1893
01:11:16,883 --> 01:11:18,119
(The unprecedented Dokdo tour begins now.)

1894
01:11:18,143 --> 01:11:20,552
First of all, when you look here,

1895
01:11:20,553 --> 01:11:22,722
- the first thing we see...
- Dokdoisabu-gil.

1896
01:11:22,723 --> 01:11:25,122
Yesterday, I...

1897
01:11:25,123 --> 01:11:27,092
- You mentioned it yesterday.
- Yes.

1898
01:11:27,093 --> 01:11:28,622
- This...
- Dokdoisabu-gil?

1899
01:11:28,623 --> 01:11:31,592
Since Dokdo is Korea's territory,

1900
01:11:31,593 --> 01:11:32,662
it would have an address.

1901
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,163
- Right.
- Yes. So,

1902
01:11:34,563 --> 01:11:37,232
it's Ulleung-gun, North Gyeongsang Province.

1903
01:11:37,233 --> 01:11:39,202
- It's also Ulleung-eup.
- Ulleung-eup.

1904
01:11:39,203 --> 01:11:42,842
Then, for Dongdo, it's Dokdoisabu-gil.

1905
01:11:42,843 --> 01:11:44,443
Dokdoisabu-gil.

1906
01:11:45,243 --> 01:11:46,742
(In the 13th year of King Jijeung, )

1907
01:11:46,743 --> 01:11:48,242
(Yisabu made a lion out of wood and compelled the people...)

1908
01:11:48,243 --> 01:11:50,683
(of Usanguk to surrender. In "History of the Three Kingdoms")

1909
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:55,283
(General Yisabu made Ulleung Island and Dokdo our land.)

1910
01:11:56,153 --> 01:11:59,253
(The address took his name in Dongdo.)

1911
01:11:59,493 --> 01:12:01,192
Then, on Seodo, we talked about it yesterday...

1912
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:02,962
- An Yong Bok.
- Dokdoanyongbok-gil.

1913
01:12:02,963 --> 01:12:04,922
Let us listen until the end.

1914
01:12:04,923 --> 01:12:06,662
- That's right.
- Who doesn't know?

1915
01:12:06,663 --> 01:12:08,733
Get a tutor if you want to do that.

1916
01:12:08,903 --> 01:12:11,102
- Who doesn't know?
- Stop showing off.

1917
01:12:11,103 --> 01:12:13,333
I'm sorry.

1918
01:12:13,603 --> 01:12:15,342
- Who doesn't know?
- Stop showing off.

1919
01:12:15,343 --> 01:12:16,373
I'm sorry.

1920
01:12:16,843 --> 01:12:18,202
- Right.
- Yes.

1921
01:12:18,203 --> 01:12:20,072
Where is Dokdoanyongbok-gil?

1922
01:12:20,073 --> 01:12:21,272
- That way.
- That's Seodo.

1923
01:12:21,273 --> 01:12:22,412
- Right.
- Right.

1924
01:12:22,413 --> 01:12:24,082
There's a sign over there.

1925
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:25,453
- Right.
- The blue one.

1926
01:12:25,853 --> 01:12:31,853
(Seodo's road name address: Dokdoanyongbok-gil)

1927
01:12:32,993 --> 01:12:34,692
(An Yong Bok said to the Japanese, )

1928
01:12:34,693 --> 01:12:36,362
("Songdo is Jasando and our land. Why set foot on our land?")

1929
01:12:36,363 --> 01:12:38,323
("Veritable Records of King Sukjong")

1930
01:12:39,163 --> 01:12:41,592
(An Yong Bok, the civilian diplomat...)

1931
01:12:41,593 --> 01:12:44,073
(that got Japan's confirmation that Dokdo is Korean territory)

1932
01:12:45,503 --> 01:12:47,032
(To preserve the hearts of the two great men...)

1933
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:48,643
(who protected Dokdo, )

1934
01:12:49,543 --> 01:12:51,742
(Dokdo's new addresses were made in 2008...)

1935
01:12:51,743 --> 01:12:53,943
(based on a citizen's proposal.)

1936
01:12:54,143 --> 01:12:56,582
This is where many people take photos...

1937
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:59,413
when they come to Dokdo.

1938
01:12:59,483 --> 01:13:01,052
It will be meaningful to take one together.

1939
01:13:01,053 --> 01:13:02,722
- Along with Professor Seo.
- Right.

1940
01:13:02,723 --> 01:13:04,753
There's someone who takes good photos here.

1941
01:13:05,053 --> 01:13:07,123
Director Joo! He'll take it for us.

1942
01:13:07,453 --> 01:13:10,623
I'll take the photo. One, two, three.

1943
01:13:11,323 --> 01:13:14,333
(A photo at Dokdoisabu-gil)

1944
01:13:14,733 --> 01:13:17,862
Gosh, it's amazing back here.

1945
01:13:17,863 --> 01:13:18,933
It's beautiful.

1946
01:13:19,033 --> 01:13:21,173
The water is so clear!

1947
01:13:22,643 --> 01:13:23,703
Gosh.

1948
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:35,553
(The clear sea stops them.)

1949
01:13:35,983 --> 01:13:37,823
- Gosh, the water is so clear.
- Gosh.

1950
01:13:39,853 --> 01:13:42,693
I think it's the clearest sea I've seen in our country.

1951
01:13:44,563 --> 01:13:46,483
The color of the waves are completely different.

1952
01:13:49,063 --> 01:13:54,133
(Dokdo's sea is especially blue.)

1953
01:13:54,873 --> 01:13:56,442
And here!

1954
01:13:56,443 --> 01:13:59,413
- We learned about Jeju's haenyeos.
- Right.

1955
01:13:59,743 --> 01:14:01,142
Who was the one who called out "cool haenyeo?"

1956
01:14:01,143 --> 01:14:03,082
- Here.
- "Cool haenyeo!"

1957
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:04,083
Right.

1958
01:14:04,084 --> 01:14:07,252
(Answer: Jeju haenyeo)

1959
01:14:07,253 --> 01:14:09,753
(He called out a cool answer yesterday.)

1960
01:14:10,123 --> 01:14:12,352
Do you see a flat rock...

1961
01:14:12,353 --> 01:14:13,952
- right over there?
- Yes.

1962
01:14:13,953 --> 01:14:15,692
The Jeju haenyeos...

1963
01:14:15,693 --> 01:14:17,793
- The cool haenyeos?
- Yes. They rested there.

1964
01:14:17,993 --> 01:14:19,392
- Really?
- Yes.

1965
01:14:19,393 --> 01:14:21,333
- Is it flat?
- Yes.

1966
01:14:21,433 --> 01:14:23,702
Seaweed was dried up there as well.

1967
01:14:23,703 --> 01:14:26,472
So that is called the Haenyeo Rock.

1968
01:14:26,473 --> 01:14:27,773
- The Haenyeo Rock.
- Yes.

1969
01:14:35,043 --> 01:14:39,713
(Jeju's haenyeos worked for the fishing industry around Dokdo.)

1970
01:14:40,513 --> 01:14:42,682
(This is a strong piece of evidence...)

1971
01:14:42,683 --> 01:14:46,023
(that a Korean citizen has made economical activities in Dokdo.)

1972
01:14:46,923 --> 01:14:50,863
(Dokdo consists of many rocks besides the Haenyeo Rock.)

1973
01:14:51,723 --> 01:14:56,003
(The Sea Lion Rock where eared seals would've jumped around)

1974
01:14:56,463 --> 01:14:59,503
(Small Sea Lion Rock, Big Sea Lion Rock)

1975
01:15:00,673 --> 01:15:04,273
(Seaweed Rock)

1976
01:15:05,373 --> 01:15:08,713
(Three Brothers Cave Rock, Candlestick Rock)

1977
01:15:09,943 --> 01:15:11,242
(Battleship Rock, Neopdeok Rock, Goose Barnacle Rock, )

1978
01:15:11,243 --> 01:15:12,552
(Elephant Rock, Chicken Rock, Fan Rock, Duck Rock, Face Rock)

1979
01:15:12,553 --> 01:15:17,323
(All of the rocks were named with Korean native words.)

1980
01:15:17,383 --> 01:15:21,192
Learning the names of the rocks...

1981
01:15:21,193 --> 01:15:22,822
- is part of the fun...
- Right.

1982
01:15:22,823 --> 01:15:24,662
Of coming to Dokdo.

1983
01:15:24,663 --> 01:15:25,833
- Right.
- Right.

1984
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:28,193
Gosh. Look here.

1985
01:15:29,003 --> 01:15:31,602
- This is another...
- "The easternmost point of Korea."

1986
01:15:31,603 --> 01:15:32,873
amazing spot.

1987
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:34,703
- Is this it?
- Yes.

1988
01:15:34,773 --> 01:15:36,642
The view here is great.

1989
01:15:36,643 --> 01:15:38,372
- If you look here, - The view.

1990
01:15:38,373 --> 01:15:41,373
The whole of Seodo can be seen, right?

1991
01:15:42,813 --> 01:15:46,583
(The stone tablet with Seodo in the background)

1992
01:15:47,213 --> 01:15:48,922
What does it say here?

1993
01:15:48,923 --> 01:15:51,052
- "The easternmost point of Korea."
- "The easternmost point of Korea."

1994
01:15:51,053 --> 01:15:52,053
Right.

1995
01:15:52,353 --> 01:15:55,993
(The easternmost point of Korea)

1996
01:15:56,263 --> 01:15:57,562
We've berthed...

1997
01:15:57,563 --> 01:15:59,232
- at Dongdo, right?
- Right.

1998
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:01,892
To celebrate the construction...

1999
01:16:01,893 --> 01:16:03,262
of the berthing facility,

2000
01:16:03,263 --> 01:16:05,332
- this stone tablet was made.
- Right.

2001
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:09,573
The font of "the easternmost point of Korea..."

2002
01:16:09,643 --> 01:16:13,012
is the handwriting of former president, Kim Young Sam.

2003
01:16:13,013 --> 01:16:15,242
- Really?
- The font of this?

2004
01:16:15,243 --> 01:16:16,783
- Yes.
- I see.

2005
01:16:18,043 --> 01:16:19,753
"The easternmost point of Korea."

2006
01:16:20,183 --> 01:16:22,152
The berthing facility of Dokdo has been built...

2007
01:16:22,153 --> 01:16:24,522
and with President Kim Young Sam's writing,

2008
01:16:24,523 --> 01:16:27,222
the stone table that clearly states that Dokdo is Korean territory...

2009
01:16:27,223 --> 01:16:29,263
was revealed today through an opening ceremony.

2010
01:16:30,063 --> 01:16:31,562
The government strongly claims...

2011
01:16:31,563 --> 01:16:33,462
that the construction of the berthing facility...

2012
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:34,762
is a valid exercise...

2013
01:16:34,763 --> 01:16:36,633
of territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction.

2014
01:16:36,803 --> 01:16:38,972
- The will of the country...
- Right.

2015
01:16:38,973 --> 01:16:40,272
Was revealed...

2016
01:16:40,273 --> 01:16:42,443
- by this stone tablet.
- Right.

2017
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,572
- It looks amazing here.
- Right.

2018
01:16:44,573 --> 01:16:47,213
- The view here is amazing.
- Dokdoisabu-gil mentioned earlier.

2019
01:16:47,343 --> 01:16:49,412
Tourists come here...

2020
01:16:49,413 --> 01:16:51,643
- and take many photos here.
- Right.

2021
01:16:51,783 --> 01:16:53,052
- The easternmost point of Korea.
- Here?

2022
01:16:53,053 --> 01:16:54,053
(We can't miss out on photos.)

2023
01:16:54,054 --> 01:16:55,953
One, two, three.

2024
01:16:56,523 --> 01:17:00,323
(A photo at the easternmost point of Korea)

2025
01:17:01,123 --> 01:17:03,523
Gosh, the water is so clear.

2026
01:17:03,563 --> 01:17:04,863
(Gasping)

2027
01:17:05,293 --> 01:17:07,833
Look! There are fish!

2028
01:17:08,133 --> 01:17:09,702
- There were a lot of fish.
- Of course.

2029
01:17:09,703 --> 01:17:11,262
- There are a lot of fish here.
- Right.

2030
01:17:11,263 --> 01:17:12,403
- Surely.
- Right.

2031
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:15,172
You can see them, right?

2032
01:17:15,173 --> 01:17:16,979
(The fish greet them in the clear sea with their nice colors.)

2033
01:17:17,003 --> 01:17:18,602
The water is so clear.

2034
01:17:18,603 --> 01:17:20,012
It looks like the water of a swimming pool.

2035
01:17:20,013 --> 01:17:21,173
How is it so clear?

2036
01:17:21,213 --> 01:17:22,782
It can't be compared with another place.

2037
01:17:22,783 --> 01:17:25,242
- It's unrivaled in how clear it is.
- Right.

2038
01:17:25,243 --> 01:17:27,053
It looks beautiful here!

2039
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:31,023
(A scenery that must be captured by a camera)

2040
01:17:32,193 --> 01:17:33,893
I want to try going in the cave.

2041
01:17:34,953 --> 01:17:39,233
It's up to right here.

2042
01:17:39,293 --> 01:17:43,502
This is how far a regular tourist can visit.

2043
01:17:43,503 --> 01:17:45,973
- It ends here.
- Right.

2044
01:17:46,303 --> 01:17:47,972
- Just for today, - Gosh.

2045
01:17:47,973 --> 01:17:49,842
We were granted permission to go further in.

2046
01:17:49,843 --> 01:17:50,972
For the members of the show.

2047
01:17:50,973 --> 01:17:52,242
Is this area usually blocked?

2048
01:17:52,243 --> 01:17:53,312
Yes.

2049
01:17:53,313 --> 01:17:56,913
We were granted official permission to move further in.

2050
01:17:57,583 --> 01:17:58,852
Let's go!

2051
01:17:58,853 --> 01:18:00,682
- We're going to the highest spot.
- Right.

2052
01:18:00,683 --> 01:18:03,203
(This shoot was done with the aid of the related organization.)

2053
01:18:03,253 --> 01:18:05,553
Look to your left and right.

2054
01:18:06,823 --> 01:18:09,923
We will be seeing Seodo from the bottom...

2055
01:18:10,063 --> 01:18:12,122
- and from the top.
- I think it will feel different.

2056
01:18:12,123 --> 01:18:13,993
There's a massive difference.

2057
01:18:15,333 --> 01:18:17,433
There are so many of these flowers. What are these?

2058
01:18:18,003 --> 01:18:20,473
(This flower)

2059
01:18:21,273 --> 01:18:24,373
(I am called the coastal moss-like stonecrop.)

2060
01:18:25,373 --> 01:18:30,683
(Dokdo is a beautiful habitat of wild flowers.)

2061
01:18:31,613 --> 01:18:33,253
Gosh, check out the color of the flowers.

2062
01:18:33,483 --> 01:18:34,913
(Panting)

2063
01:18:34,953 --> 01:18:37,052
Can it be seen through the screen?

2064
01:18:37,053 --> 01:18:39,423
(Capturing the color of the wild flowers)

2065
01:18:40,853 --> 01:18:44,293
(Se Yoon is curious about how Seodo looks from up top.)

2066
01:18:44,363 --> 01:18:45,633
It's great to see you, Seodo.

2067
01:18:46,993 --> 01:18:49,363
Is it mugwort? I guess it's not.

2068
01:18:49,963 --> 01:18:51,033
No.

2069
01:18:52,403 --> 01:18:53,833
We have climbed up a lot.

2070
01:18:54,273 --> 01:18:55,773
We have just a bit more left.

2071
01:18:56,503 --> 01:18:57,803
Are we almost there?

2072
01:18:59,413 --> 01:19:01,772
So we're climbing up to the top over there.

2073
01:19:01,773 --> 01:19:02,813
Right.

2074
01:19:02,983 --> 01:19:04,223
We still have a long way to go.

2075
01:19:04,913 --> 01:19:07,213
This is one of the toughest courses.

2076
01:19:09,553 --> 01:19:10,582
Don't push me.

2077
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:12,123
(The stairs become steeper.)

2078
01:19:12,653 --> 01:19:15,223
Gosh, the stairs are very steep.

2079
01:19:16,523 --> 01:19:19,062
(While walking facing forward, )

2080
01:19:19,063 --> 01:19:20,933
(if you turn around...)

2081
01:19:21,893 --> 01:19:23,933
Gosh, this is insane.

2082
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:27,833
Gosh, it feels different.

2083
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:30,502
It's already beautiful from this high up.

2084
01:19:30,503 --> 01:19:31,743
(A new sea view appears.)

2085
01:19:33,313 --> 01:19:34,443
Gosh, it's so clean.

2086
01:19:34,913 --> 01:19:36,583
The water is so clean.

2087
01:19:36,783 --> 01:19:39,312
It must be because the water was unharmed,

2088
01:19:39,313 --> 01:19:40,753
but the water is really clean.

2089
01:19:43,053 --> 01:19:44,752
I think the East Sea is the most beautiful.

2090
01:19:44,753 --> 01:19:45,952
- Right.
- Right.

2091
01:19:45,953 --> 01:19:47,633
(The bottom of the clear sea can be seen.)

2092
01:19:48,853 --> 01:19:51,063
This is Moon Se Yoon looking at the Haenyeo Rock.

2093
01:19:52,163 --> 01:19:53,462
You look like an eared seal.

2094
01:19:53,463 --> 01:19:55,393
(You look like an eared seal.)

2095
01:19:56,263 --> 01:19:58,433
- I really want to see eared seals.
- Right.

2096
01:19:58,503 --> 01:20:00,472
They would've played around there.

2097
01:20:00,473 --> 01:20:02,472
It feels upsetting as they were announced extinct.

2098
01:20:02,473 --> 01:20:04,473
Too many of them were killed.

2099
01:20:04,573 --> 01:20:07,643
How bad was it for them to become extinct?

2100
01:20:07,773 --> 01:20:08,813
Gosh.

2101
01:20:12,113 --> 01:20:15,553
(Dokdo was also called Gajido as there were many eared seals.)

2102
01:20:16,183 --> 01:20:18,452
(Then eared seals became extinct due to...)

2103
01:20:18,453 --> 01:20:22,593
(Japan's reckless capture for their leather and oil.)

2104
01:20:23,863 --> 01:20:25,622
(Their hearts feel heavy as they can not be seen again.)

2105
01:20:25,623 --> 01:20:27,292
They were completely annihilated.

2106
01:20:27,293 --> 01:20:28,393
Right.

2107
01:20:30,133 --> 01:20:32,132
Let's move to the first spot.

2108
01:20:32,133 --> 01:20:33,733
- Right.
- Let's go.

2109
01:20:34,733 --> 01:20:36,043
We have just a bit more left.

2110
01:20:37,343 --> 01:20:38,442
(Se Yoon's camera)

2111
01:20:38,443 --> 01:20:40,342
It was quite exhausting to come up here,

2112
01:20:40,343 --> 01:20:42,483
but it didn't feel that way.

2113
01:20:43,243 --> 01:20:45,403
It must be because we got to see many different views.

2114
01:20:46,053 --> 01:20:47,553
- Stick to the left.
- Gosh.

2115
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:49,923
Gosh!

2116
01:20:50,183 --> 01:20:51,823
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2117
01:20:51,923 --> 01:20:53,593
- It's spectacular.
- It's amazing.

2118
01:20:54,153 --> 01:20:55,892
- It's amazing.
- It's thrilling.

2119
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:56,963
Take a look.

2120
01:20:57,423 --> 01:20:59,062
- All the way down there.
- This is crazy.

2121
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:00,332
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2122
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:02,763
- This is crazy.
- It's amazing.

2123
01:21:03,263 --> 01:21:05,873
- Right by the cliff.
- This is a spectacular sight.

2124
01:21:06,103 --> 01:21:07,803
This doesn't make sense.

2125
01:21:09,243 --> 01:21:11,042
This was formed by nature.

2126
01:21:11,043 --> 01:21:12,143
Right.

2127
01:21:13,513 --> 01:21:15,882
We managed to make it here...

2128
01:21:15,883 --> 01:21:17,642
- when the sun is shining this way.
- Right.

2129
01:21:17,643 --> 01:21:19,583
Talk about perfect timing.

2130
01:21:21,953 --> 01:21:23,482
(They stay for a while to enjoy the view.)

2131
01:21:23,483 --> 01:21:25,222
- Gosh.
- It's beautiful.

2132
01:21:25,223 --> 01:21:26,323
Right.

2133
01:21:28,023 --> 01:21:30,363
- Let's move now.
- Right.

2134
01:21:30,723 --> 01:21:32,763
Let's move to the first destination.

2135
01:21:34,963 --> 01:21:38,602
This is the first thing that I feel after coming here.

2136
01:21:38,603 --> 01:21:40,573
- The Taegeukgi is right there.
- Right.

2137
01:21:43,503 --> 01:21:48,143
(The Taegeukgi is guarding the easternmost point of Korea.)

2138
01:21:48,173 --> 01:21:49,712
It just feels overwhelming...

2139
01:21:49,713 --> 01:21:51,613
- Gosh.
- when you come here.

2140
01:21:52,143 --> 01:21:53,782
It feels emotional.

2141
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:56,343
(Let's head toward the treasure that lies beyond the Taegeukgi.)

2142
01:21:56,953 --> 01:21:58,123
It's Dokdo!

2143
01:21:58,823 --> 01:22:00,052
"Dokdo" is written on it, right?

2144
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:01,529
(The place with the stone tablet of Dokdo)

2145
01:22:01,553 --> 01:22:04,622
This is the first spot...

2146
01:22:04,623 --> 01:22:06,733
that I will introduce.

2147
01:22:06,863 --> 01:22:08,862
- It's the Mangyangdae Pavilion.
- Mangyangdae Pavilion.

2148
01:22:08,863 --> 01:22:11,532
- "Mang" means to look.
- To look.

2149
01:22:11,533 --> 01:22:13,803
"Yang" means vast sea.

2150
01:22:14,603 --> 01:22:16,942
A place where you can look at the vast sea.

2151
01:22:16,943 --> 01:22:18,142
- It's really nice.
- Right.

2152
01:22:18,143 --> 01:22:19,643
As it's Mangyangdae Pavilion,

2153
01:22:20,013 --> 01:22:23,142
You'll be amazed at how our sea, the East Sea, looks...

2154
01:22:23,143 --> 01:22:26,413
- if you go behind this.
- I see.

2155
01:22:26,983 --> 01:22:30,223
(What kind of sight awaits them?)

2156
01:22:32,183 --> 01:22:33,422
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

2157
01:22:33,423 --> 01:22:36,823
Even the sunlight is helping us today.

2158
01:22:37,263 --> 01:22:39,063
- It's endless.
- Right.

2159
01:22:39,133 --> 01:22:40,533
My goodness.

2160
01:22:40,663 --> 01:22:43,133
This is a truly vast ocean.

2161
01:22:43,603 --> 01:22:45,832
The ocean is huge.

2162
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:50,903
(The endless sea stretches out before their eyes.)

2163
01:22:51,003 --> 01:22:55,712
(East Sea)

2164
01:22:55,713 --> 01:22:58,712
As you all know,

2165
01:22:58,713 --> 01:23:01,112
- this is the East Sea.
- Yes. The East Sea.

2166
01:23:01,113 --> 01:23:03,922
These days, the name "East Sea" is...

2167
01:23:03,923 --> 01:23:05,482
often used interchangeably.

2168
01:23:05,483 --> 01:23:08,993
And a lot of maps have changed the name to "East Sea."

2169
01:23:09,023 --> 01:23:10,662
We must build on this momentum...

2170
01:23:10,663 --> 01:23:13,192
and keep working hard to make...

2171
01:23:13,193 --> 01:23:14,633
more changes.

2172
01:23:15,363 --> 01:23:17,362
This is truly the best.

2173
01:23:17,363 --> 01:23:18,962
- It's fascinating.
- The easternmost part of Korea.

2174
01:23:18,963 --> 01:23:20,643
(The East Sea seen from beneath Taegeukgi)

2175
01:23:21,173 --> 01:23:22,703
This is amazing.

2176
01:23:24,043 --> 01:23:26,513
- I'm getting emotional.
- I know.

2177
01:23:26,913 --> 01:23:28,772
It feels strange. It's somewhat touching.

2178
01:23:28,773 --> 01:23:30,042
Of course.

2179
01:23:30,043 --> 01:23:32,783
Because of the things we've heard since childhood.

2180
01:23:34,153 --> 01:23:37,152
Dokdo, a lonely island that has long protected...

2181
01:23:37,153 --> 01:23:38,822
this vast sea.

2182
01:23:38,823 --> 01:23:41,269
(Dokdo, a lonely island that has long protected this vast sea)

2183
01:23:41,293 --> 01:23:42,822
It will be backlit.

2184
01:23:42,823 --> 01:23:43,823
Good.

2185
01:23:43,824 --> 01:23:45,763
One, two, three.

2186
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:50,133
(A photo in front of the East Sea at Mangyangdae Pavilion)

2187
01:23:50,863 --> 01:23:53,333
- We have one place left now.
- Okay.

2188
01:23:53,803 --> 01:23:55,073
I'm really grateful.

2189
01:23:55,943 --> 01:23:56,943
My goodness.

2190
01:23:56,944 --> 01:23:58,342
(Jong Min's camera)

2191
01:23:58,343 --> 01:24:01,673
You probably haven't seen this view a lot before.

2192
01:24:02,683 --> 01:24:03,913
This is the view.

2193
01:24:04,243 --> 01:24:05,513
Such a beautiful view

2194
01:24:06,313 --> 01:24:11,023
(A view that was probably intended)

2195
01:24:11,053 --> 01:24:14,193
(Jong Min's camera)

2196
01:24:14,253 --> 01:24:15,523
You must've been surprised.

2197
01:24:15,993 --> 01:24:17,993
(We will keep Se Yoon's view to ourselves.)

2198
01:24:18,093 --> 01:24:19,462
We've reached the top...

2199
01:24:19,463 --> 01:24:20,863
- of Dongdo now.
- Yes. We're here.

2200
01:24:22,233 --> 01:24:24,633
(Team 2 Days 1 Night has already reached the top.)

2201
01:24:25,803 --> 01:24:27,403
My goodness.

2202
01:24:27,603 --> 01:24:30,273
We are starting to see some letters.

2203
01:24:31,273 --> 01:24:32,973
- Korea?
- Yes.

2204
01:24:33,873 --> 01:24:35,813
What's the letter below it?

2205
01:24:36,413 --> 01:24:37,712
- Below it...
- Yes.

2206
01:24:37,713 --> 01:24:39,633
Just tell me the initial, and I'll try to guess.

2207
01:24:40,783 --> 01:24:44,122
I must say it starts with a T.

2208
01:24:44,123 --> 01:24:45,283
Korean Territory?

2209
01:24:45,523 --> 01:24:47,152
- It says Korean Territory.
- Korean Territory.

2210
01:24:47,153 --> 01:24:48,492
Korean Territory. Yes.

2211
01:24:48,493 --> 01:24:49,999
(A rock with the letters "Korean Territory" written on it)

2212
01:24:50,023 --> 01:24:52,092
Everyone, yesterday,

2213
01:24:52,093 --> 01:24:54,162
we talked about the Dokdo Volunteer Garrison.

2214
01:24:54,163 --> 01:24:55,693
- We did, right?
- Yes.

2215
01:24:55,963 --> 01:24:57,703
It's an important group...

2216
01:24:57,763 --> 01:25:01,503
that protected Dokdo and is an integral part...

2217
01:25:01,673 --> 01:25:03,573
of Dokdo's history.

2218
01:25:05,803 --> 01:25:09,173
(During the Korean War)

2219
01:25:09,513 --> 01:25:10,742
During the Korean War,

2220
01:25:10,743 --> 01:25:13,052
we couldn't afford to take care of this island.

2221
01:25:13,053 --> 01:25:14,612
- Of course not.
- Japan took advantage of that...

2222
01:25:14,613 --> 01:25:17,953
and came here to drive stakes.

2223
01:25:18,783 --> 01:25:21,703
(Japan, taking advantage of the war, landed on Dokdo without permission.)

2224
01:25:22,453 --> 01:25:24,793
(They installed Japanese territorial markers on Dokdo...)

2225
01:25:25,623 --> 01:25:28,363
(and expelled Korean fishermen.)

2226
01:25:28,933 --> 01:25:32,432
(It made the young people of Ulleung Island...)

2227
01:25:32,433 --> 01:25:35,433
(volunteer to take action.)

2228
01:25:36,973 --> 01:25:40,613
(Dokdo Volunteer Garrison)

2229
01:25:41,143 --> 01:25:43,243
(A sign carved to protect Dokdo, )

2230
01:25:44,113 --> 01:25:47,383
(indicating that Dokdo is Korean territory)

2231
01:25:47,683 --> 01:25:50,752
There's one date I'd like you to remember...

2232
01:25:50,753 --> 01:25:52,483
regarding Dokdo.

2233
01:25:52,623 --> 01:25:56,693
It's November 21, 1954.

2234
01:25:57,263 --> 01:25:58,593
Here's what happened.

2235
01:25:58,923 --> 01:26:01,563
Three Japanese patrol boats...

2236
01:26:01,963 --> 01:26:06,433
and a patrol aircraft attempted to enter Dokdo,

2237
01:26:06,733 --> 01:26:08,972
but the Dokdo Volunteer Garrison repelled them.

2238
01:26:08,973 --> 01:26:10,142
- They fought back?
- Yes.

2239
01:26:10,143 --> 01:26:12,603
The Dokdo Volunteer Garrison was truly amazing.

2240
01:26:12,713 --> 01:26:14,672
- They faced harsh conditions...
- Right.

2241
01:26:14,673 --> 01:26:15,742
And had no weapons.

2242
01:26:15,743 --> 01:26:18,882
But they came up with a brilliant strategy.

2243
01:26:18,883 --> 01:26:20,953
They wanted to look like...

2244
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:23,482
they were armed with good weapons from a distance.

2245
01:26:23,483 --> 01:26:24,483
They wanted to look strong.

2246
01:26:24,484 --> 01:26:25,523
That's right.

2247
01:26:25,653 --> 01:26:28,622
They painted some logs black...

2248
01:26:28,623 --> 01:26:30,122
to make them look like cannons from a distance.

2249
01:26:30,123 --> 01:26:31,192
(The conditions were so harsh that camouflage tactics had to be used.)

2250
01:26:31,193 --> 01:26:33,162
They even used such a clever strategy.

2251
01:26:33,163 --> 01:26:34,592
The Dokdo Volunteer Garrison...

2252
01:26:34,593 --> 01:26:37,302
played a crucial role in protecting Dokdo.

2253
01:26:37,303 --> 01:26:39,349
(The great men risked their lives to protect Dokdo.)

2254
01:26:39,373 --> 01:26:41,902
We all felt the same way.

2255
01:26:41,903 --> 01:26:43,272
(Kim Yeong Bok, a member of the Dokdo Volunteer Garrison)

2256
01:26:43,273 --> 01:26:45,373
Even though I was injured too,

2257
01:26:45,543 --> 01:26:48,373
but all those injured felt the same way.

2258
01:26:48,543 --> 01:26:50,013
That Dokdo was our territory.

2259
01:26:51,843 --> 01:26:54,412
(A sign carved into a rock with the sole purpose...)

2260
01:26:54,413 --> 01:26:58,883
(of protecting our land)

2261
01:26:58,923 --> 01:27:00,892
If we hadn't...

2262
01:27:00,893 --> 01:27:02,862
- If we hadn't stopped them...
- stopped them...

2263
01:27:02,863 --> 01:27:05,622
or been on the island at that time, they might have occupied the land.

2264
01:27:05,623 --> 01:27:07,632
- I don't even want to imagine it.
- I know.

2265
01:27:07,633 --> 01:27:10,132
(Their hearts are filled with reverence before the sign.)

2266
01:27:10,133 --> 01:27:13,273
All right. So, we saw the rock that says "Korean Territory."

2267
01:27:13,533 --> 01:27:14,902
This way. Let's go.

2268
01:27:14,903 --> 01:27:16,742
(And other people who protected Dokdo)

2269
01:27:16,743 --> 01:27:19,142
It says "Republic of Korea" here, right?

2270
01:27:19,143 --> 01:27:20,543
- Yes.
- Yes.

2271
01:27:23,443 --> 01:27:25,183
- This is a monument.
- Yes.

2272
01:27:25,883 --> 01:27:29,353
This is where we stand in solemn reverence at the top of Dongdo.

2273
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:32,922
A monument stands here...

2274
01:27:32,923 --> 01:27:35,822
for the police officers...

2275
01:27:35,823 --> 01:27:39,092
who died protecting Dokdo.

2276
01:27:39,093 --> 01:27:41,233
- While carrying out their duty?
- Yes.

2277
01:27:41,763 --> 01:27:45,463
It's important that the police have protected this place for so long,

2278
01:27:45,763 --> 01:27:48,472
hoping that future generations...

2279
01:27:48,473 --> 01:27:50,473
will remember it.

2280
01:27:50,543 --> 01:27:52,813
- I believe that's what's important.
- Right.

2281
01:27:52,873 --> 01:27:54,872
Now that we're here,

2282
01:27:54,873 --> 01:27:57,282
I'd like us to take a moment to pay a silent tribute.

2283
01:27:57,283 --> 01:27:59,382
- Come here.
- Oh, right here.

2284
01:27:59,383 --> 01:28:01,653
There are two people my age here.

2285
01:28:03,623 --> 01:28:04,653
Attention.

2286
01:28:05,953 --> 01:28:06,953
Pay a silent tribute.

2287
01:28:07,823 --> 01:28:09,822
(At the summit of Dokdo, )

2288
01:28:09,823 --> 01:28:13,463
(we met heroes we never knew existed.)

2289
01:28:14,093 --> 01:28:18,203
(I felt a sense of reverence before the monument.)

2290
01:28:18,663 --> 01:28:23,273
(Even now, the work to protect Dokdo continues.)

2291
01:28:23,803 --> 01:28:27,842
(I will remember the sacrifices made to protect Dokdo.)

2292
01:28:27,843 --> 01:28:29,242
At ease.

2293
01:28:29,243 --> 01:28:32,683
This is why we came all the way here.

2294
01:28:33,053 --> 01:28:35,352
There's one more place to go.

2295
01:28:35,353 --> 01:28:37,022
- Really?
- Yes. There's something left.

2296
01:28:37,023 --> 01:28:38,823
- There's nowhere to go from here.
- Right.

2297
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:40,622
I think we're at the top.

2298
01:28:40,623 --> 01:28:41,943
(They just follow Professor Seo.)

2299
01:28:42,193 --> 01:28:44,263
- My goodness.
- Gosh, what's that?

2300
01:28:44,623 --> 01:28:45,993
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

2301
01:28:46,593 --> 01:28:47,692
My gosh.

2302
01:28:47,693 --> 01:28:49,253
(What awaits Team 2 Days 1 Night is...)

2303
01:28:50,563 --> 01:28:51,663
Taegeukgi.

2304
01:28:51,863 --> 01:28:53,433
My goodness. Look at this.

2305
01:28:53,473 --> 01:28:56,242
- It looks so cool.
- At the top of Dongdo,

2306
01:28:56,243 --> 01:28:57,972
there's Taegeukgi.

2307
01:28:57,973 --> 01:28:59,712
There's no denying this.

2308
01:28:59,713 --> 01:29:01,943
- Of course not.
- This is game over.

2309
01:29:02,073 --> 01:29:04,542
Look right behind you. It's the lighthouse.

2310
01:29:04,543 --> 01:29:06,353
- It's a lighthouse.
- Yes.

2311
01:29:06,653 --> 01:29:08,733
The sea was so beautiful that I didn't even look up.

2312
01:29:09,053 --> 01:29:11,722
One of the lighthouse's most important roles is...

2313
01:29:11,723 --> 01:29:13,322
- To prevent getting lost.
- Exactly.

2314
01:29:13,323 --> 01:29:16,192
It serves to guide boats...

2315
01:29:16,193 --> 01:29:18,462
and protect fishermen...

2316
01:29:18,463 --> 01:29:19,832
on the sea, right?

2317
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:21,562
The fact that we have such a lighthouse...

2318
01:29:21,563 --> 01:29:23,403
right on this island...

2319
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:26,832
proves that Dokdo is...

2320
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:28,032
Korean territory.

2321
01:29:28,033 --> 01:29:29,173
- That's right.
- Sure.

2322
01:29:29,503 --> 01:29:31,142
It goes without saying.

2323
01:29:31,143 --> 01:29:33,463
(Another piece of evidence that Dokdo is Korean territory)

2324
01:29:33,973 --> 01:29:37,983
(On our way to the summit of Dokdo, )

2325
01:29:39,043 --> 01:29:44,782
(we have encountered...)

2326
01:29:44,783 --> 01:29:51,523
(countless great people.)

2327
01:29:52,393 --> 01:29:55,693
(Just to protect this lonely island, )

2328
01:29:56,433 --> 01:30:00,532
(countless people are...)

2329
01:30:00,533 --> 01:30:06,143
(still working hard.)

2330
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:08,472
(From the KBS documentary, "Three Days")

2331
01:30:08,473 --> 01:30:10,089
(72 Hours on the Coast Guard's Sambongho to Protect Dokdo)

2332
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:12,083
How does Dokdo look from the sky?

2333
01:30:13,813 --> 01:30:18,082
I think it's a precious, beautiful, youngest island...

2334
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:20,592
of our country,

2335
01:30:20,593 --> 01:30:23,463
worth our effort to protect.

2336
01:30:23,923 --> 01:30:30,233
(Dokdo, our precious land, protected by so many people)

2337
01:30:31,103 --> 01:30:34,403
How was it looking around Dokdo with me today?

2338
01:30:34,573 --> 01:30:37,242
- It was a valuable experience, - I see.

2339
01:30:37,243 --> 01:30:39,472
Making me realize that this is our land.

2340
01:30:39,473 --> 01:30:41,412
How nice. How did you feel?

2341
01:30:41,413 --> 01:30:43,212
It was such an honor...

2342
01:30:43,213 --> 01:30:45,082
to be here as a citizen of our country.

2343
01:30:45,083 --> 01:30:47,752
And I feel like I learned so much from you,

2344
01:30:47,753 --> 01:30:49,752
so I want to express my gratitude.

2345
01:30:49,753 --> 01:30:53,652
Every time I see Dokdo, the word "wonder" comes to mind.

2346
01:30:53,653 --> 01:30:55,222
It's not just beautiful.

2347
01:30:55,223 --> 01:30:56,922
There are no words to describe its beauty.

2348
01:30:56,923 --> 01:30:58,062
- It's wonderful.
- Yes.

2349
01:30:58,063 --> 01:31:02,032
I hope many Koreans will come and see Dokdo.

2350
01:31:02,033 --> 01:31:03,232
That's right.

2351
01:31:03,233 --> 01:31:05,903
- Did you see the boat coming in?
- Yes.

2352
01:31:06,233 --> 01:31:08,032
- They're Korean tourists.
- Yes.

2353
01:31:08,033 --> 01:31:10,042
I hope our tourists will visit often...

2354
01:31:10,043 --> 01:31:13,472
- That's right.
- so we can all work together...

2355
01:31:13,473 --> 01:31:16,313
to revitalize tourism in Ulleung Island and Dokdo.

2356
01:31:19,013 --> 01:31:20,612
(Everyone...)

2357
01:31:20,613 --> 01:31:25,523
(who visits this island...)

2358
01:31:25,823 --> 01:31:29,022
(harbors the thought that flutters...)

2359
01:31:29,023 --> 01:31:32,463
(from the moment they set foot on Dokdo.)

2360
01:31:33,433 --> 01:31:35,332

2361
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:38,463

- Visit Dokdo!
- Dokdo is our land
