1
00:00:00,703 --> 00:00:04,643
(The Nakdong River flows through the city...)

2
00:00:05,443 --> 00:00:08,773
(filled with forests of various shades of green...)

3
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:13,953
(where rich history and artistic inspiration coexists.)

4
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:16,423
(We are in...)

5
00:00:16,553 --> 00:00:20,393
(Chilgok, North Gyeongsang Province.)

6
00:00:20,823 --> 00:00:22,303
- Look at the flowers.
- It's just...

7
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,063
It's beautiful.

8
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:26,263
Isn't this a Catholic church?

9
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:27,962
- It looks really old.
- It's a Catholic church.

10
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:29,032
That's typical of them.

11
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:30,309
"When Life Gives You Tangerines."

12
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,333
- Why?
- Is this the place?

13
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:32,462
In "When Life Gives You Tangerines,"

14
00:00:32,463 --> 00:00:33,932
- Geum Myung...
- Geum Myung's wedding...

15
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,002
Don't tell. I haven't watched it yet.

16
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:36,003
- Me neither!
- I haven't either.

17
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:37,372
Why would you say that?

18
00:00:37,373 --> 00:00:38,742
Keep up with the trend.

19
00:00:38,743 --> 00:00:40,313
I'm watching "Lovers in Paris" now.

20
00:00:40,913 --> 00:00:42,442
- He's watching "Lovers in Paris."
- My gosh.

21
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:44,012
And DinDin just started watching "Soonpoong OBGYN."

22
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:45,782
- For real?
- I'm watching "Minari."

23
00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:47,312
- What are you filming?
- From that angle?

24
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,413
This is the spot.

25
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:50,322
This is where they shot the scene.

26
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:52,252
- The blue car was over here.
- Yes.

27
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:53,993
- And the wedding happened there.
- Yes.

28
00:00:54,223 --> 00:00:55,452
"I kept my promise."

29
00:00:55,453 --> 00:00:56,622
It must be because...

30
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,022
I watched the drama. It feels surreal to be here.

31
00:00:58,023 --> 00:00:59,122
- I love it here.
- Yes.

32
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:00,232
I'm hooked on the drama now.

33
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:01,432
- You're a big fan of IU.
- This was in the scene.

34
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:02,493
Yes, I am.

35
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,762
(Its beauty earned its spot as a filming location...)

36
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:07,873
(for the drama, "When Life Gives You Tangerines.")

37
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:11,102
(It was built in 1924...)

38
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:14,313
(and holds a history spanning over a century.)

39
00:01:14,773 --> 00:01:17,542
(The opening segment location, Gasil Catholic Church)

40
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,282
- This place is beautiful.
- Gosh, everyone is here.

41
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:20,412
(This place is beautiful.)

42
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,452
It's beautiful here.

43
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:23,222
Right. Just coming to this place would be therapeutic.

44
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:25,952
This place makes you feel purified even if you did nothing wrong.

45
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,292
- That's how it feels.
- It feels great indeed.

46
00:01:27,293 --> 00:01:28,493
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

47
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,392
It's your first shoot after your wedding. How do you feel?

48
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:31,662
- Has your attitude changed?
- Congratulations.

49
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:32,663
Seriously.

50
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:35,292
I was supposed to go on my honeymoon, but I didn't.

51
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:36,503
- Because of Dex?
- Well...

52
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,763
So you couldn't go.

53
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,902
Actually, you were supposed to go...

54
00:01:38,903 --> 00:01:40,632
- right after the wedding.
- Yes.

55
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,503
Then Dex could have joined us.

56
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,842
But he looked into Dex's schedule.

57
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:46,302
When Dex's schedule didn't work out, you had to change the date.

58
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:47,312
- So you're leaving later.
- Right.

59
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:48,972
That's the responsibility of the head of the family.

60
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:50,042
- Yes, that's right.
- Gosh.

61
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,182
I knew you would understand me.

62
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:53,082
- He knows as he's newly married.
- How is it?

63
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,482
- What do you mean?
- How is it now that...

64
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:55,952
you're a married man?

65
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:57,653
Has anything changed about your attitude?

66
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,253
- You're married now.
- Why are you crying?

67
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:02,253
I have allergies.

68
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:04,662
- That's what your marriage means?
- What are you allergic to?

69
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:06,469
- You're allergic to your marriage?
- That's what you're allergic to?

70
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,832
Did you just say you were allergic to your marriage?

71
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,739
- That's right.
- "I'm allergic to my marriage."

72
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,963
It tickles my heart in the sweetest way.

73
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,573
Does it tickle you like this?

74
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,102
This was the most memorable moment of his wedding.

75
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:22,013
Jong Min was asked to deliver a thank-you message to his guests.

76
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,683
He said, "I'll always root for you."

77
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:27,113
- Yes, I said that. Yes.
- Gosh, that was great.

78
00:02:27,283 --> 00:02:29,453
It was the first time a groom rooted for the guests.

79
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:32,122
(He rooted for his guests in the middle of the wedding hall.)

80
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:33,552
And there was one more moment.

81
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,093
I was able to make an amazing moment just like Jong Min wanted.

82
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:38,562
Jae Seok shouted, "2 Days 1 Night" at the wedding.

83
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:39,592
- Yes.
- Right.

84
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,992
- I saw the clip going around.
- Yes.

85
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,762
- Jong Min told me he wanted...
- It was a delightful moment.

86
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,162
- to hear it from Jae Seok.
- Yes.

87
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,602
- My gosh.
- I told him I'd make it happen.

88
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:47,133
- And I did.
- Exactly.

89
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:48,802
Jong Min said he wanted to hear Jae Seok...

90
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:50,443
shout, "2 Days 1 Night."

91
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:52,602
- Please.
- Don't do it.

92
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:55,072
(Haha: Don't do it!)

93
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:57,013
- 2 Days...
- 1 Night!

94
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,212
- You were the MC for Part Two.
- Yes.

95
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,052
- So...
- I thought he was an announcer.

96
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:02,053
- Who?
- Apparently, two announcers...

97
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:03,682
- came to my wedding.
- All of a sudden, these two...

98
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,682
- turned it into a serious event.
- Seriously.

99
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:06,822
Even up until Part Two began, we said,

100
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:07,992
"Hey, let's make it fun. I'll do an impression."

101
00:03:07,993 --> 00:03:09,153
Then it began.

102
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:10,892
Once it started, I felt like we shouldn't do it.

103
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:12,262
- So...
- So we didn't do it.

104
00:03:12,263 --> 00:03:15,062
- LYn sang "My Destiny."
- Yes.

105
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:16,063
Lee Juck sang...

106
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,063
- "Relieved."
- "Relieved."

107
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,402
- TVXQ sang "Hug."
- Yes.

108
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:19,609
He prepared to do Choi Hong Man's version of "Hug."

109
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,832
I prepared to do Ju Hyun's version of "My Destiny."

110
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,713
- You prepared that?
- Let's hear it, Hong Man.

111
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,143
Hello. I'm Choi Hong Man.

112
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:28,013
I want to be your bed just for a day

113
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:29,412
(I want to be your bed)

114
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:32,413
(Just for a day)

115
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,183
- After this...
- Baby

116
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:36,682
- This...
- You should have done it.

117
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,752
- You should've done it.
- My gosh.

118
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:39,522
- What about Ju Hyun's version...
- Ju Hyun's impression.

119
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:40,592
"My Destiny."

120
00:03:40,593 --> 00:03:41,992
During Part One, LYn sang...

121
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:43,623
- "My Destiny." Right?
- Yes.

122
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,622
Ju Hyun will join us next.

123
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:46,893
Sir, please go ahead.

124
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,492
(You are)

125
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:52,463
(My destiny)

126
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:55,572
(His version of "My Destiny" sounds rather old-fashioned.)

127
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:56,872
- We looked at each other.
- You should have done it.

128
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:57,873
- Hey.
- But...

129
00:03:57,874 --> 00:03:59,102
- What?
- You should've done it.

130
00:03:59,103 --> 00:04:00,512
You were the MCs for Part Two for entertainment.

131
00:04:00,513 --> 00:04:01,642
- Why...
- They were so serious.

132
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:03,582
Jae Seok did a great job. So they were under pressure.

133
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,742
- So...
- They were way too serious.

134
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:06,853
When we went up, we saw so many of our seniors.

135
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:09,513
"All right. Now,"

136
00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:10,782
- "we'll begin Part 2."
- "This is Part 2."

137
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:11,783
- I thought they were announcers.
- "Let us begin."

138
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,899
- "The bride looks gorgeous."
- I thought it was the 9pm news.

139
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:16,092
- You know what was so touching?
- Gosh, seriously.

140
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:17,492
It's about the comments...

141
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:19,523
under your videos and news articles.

142
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:21,492
- Yes. They congratulated me.
- I'm so grateful for them.

143
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:23,902
The whole country was rooting for your wedding.

144
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:26,402
Why don't you thank the people who rooted for you?

145
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:27,802
You ought to say a thank-you message.

146
00:04:27,803 --> 00:04:31,572
So many people congratulated me. I'm sincerely grateful.

147
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:33,043
Everyone, I'll root for you.

148
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:35,713
(Laughing)

149
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:37,442
- You're Rooting Kim.
- Yes.

150
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,113
I'll root for you too.

151
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:40,812
Let's do this.

152
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,712
One more member needs to be congratulated.

153
00:04:42,713 --> 00:04:43,722
- Another one?
- What is it about?

154
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:45,223
- It's about Joon.
- Yes, I know!

155
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:46,792
He'll be in his first musical.

156
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:47,822
(Joon makes a debut as a musical actor.)

157
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:49,023
- A musical star.
- Hey.

158
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:50,262
"Even If This Love Disappears..."

159
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:51,392
- "from the World Tonight."
- When will it begin?

160
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:52,492
- What's the title?
- My gosh.

161
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:53,562
- You know the title.
- "Even If This Love Disappears..."

162
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:55,109
- "from the World Tonight."
- "From the World Tonight."

163
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,602
("Even If This Love Disappears from the World Tonight")

164
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:58,302
(Joon will perform in a musical.)

165
00:04:58,303 --> 00:04:59,802
Could you sing a number from the musical?

166
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:01,803
Can you sing a snippet of a song from the musical?

167
00:05:01,873 --> 00:05:04,172
But I don't feel confident about the song yet.

168
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:05,573
- But still.
- It's okay.

169
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:06,972
- You can keep it short.
- Put your bag down.

170
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,372
The background looks great. Look at the cathedral.

171
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:10,543
(An unfamiliar mood)

172
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,312
(Something feels off today)

173
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,353
- I can't do it.
- Gosh.

174
00:05:14,553 --> 00:05:17,323
(Then we should call Hong Man.)

175
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,653
(Ju Hyun is brought back too.)

176
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:23,493
- Tonight - Hong Man.

177
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:25,022
(Tonight and tomorrow night)

178
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:26,563
(I can't stop thinking about you)

179
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:28,563
- Joon - Wait.

180
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:29,902
- This is why you had Part Two.
- Our Joon

181
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:32,163
You were supposed to do this at my wedding, not here.

182
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,802
Not being able to do this is torturing me.

183
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:35,179
I'm doing it whenever I get a chance.

184
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:37,172
Seon Ho's drama will begin soon.

185
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:39,079
- Right. We should talk about that.
- Congratulations.

186
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:40,772
- It will premiere on May 30.
- What's the title?

187
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,012
It's called "Oh My Ghost Clients."

188
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:43,612
Rooting Kim. Can you root for him?

189
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:44,982
- Gosh, sure.
- Please root for him.

190
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:46,412
- Jong Min should root for you.
- Hey.

191
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,753
- I'll root for you.
- Yes.

192
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,953
- My drama will do well.
- Seriously.

193
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:52,222
And "Daydrinking" is well-received.

194
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:53,252
Well, I'm doing my best.

195
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,422
- I was watching the music video.
- That's a great song.

196
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:58,262
His fans left comments like, "He's so cute."

197
00:05:58,263 --> 00:06:00,233
- Gosh, no.
- "It's my go-to track for school."

198
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:03,303
I mean it when I say this. I listened to DinDin's song...

199
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:04,763
over 100 times.

200
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,153
You play the Game of Wits. Right?

201
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,032
- The Game of Wits. One, two, three.
- Yes.

202
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:09,033
(Screaming)

203
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:12,842
(This is the Game of Wits Joon is talking about.)

204
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:14,842
- But you should have kept it real.
- Okay.

205
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:16,789
He doesn't play it like that when he plays the game.

206
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:19,094
He should've kept a straight face. But he didn't do that.

207
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:20,412
- And...
- So was I supposed to do this then?

208
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,413
"Let's play the Game of Wits."

209
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,529
- "Why aren't you playing it?"
- Yes, you should've done that.

210
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:24,722
- Gosh. It's for my song.
- It wasn't like him.

211
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:26,522
- "One, two, three. Oh, no."
- He was faking it.

212
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:27,552
- He was faking it.
- He was faking it.

213
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,753
Were you not happy about that?

214
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,492
- He should've done this instead.
- Do you know what annoyed me?

215
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:32,093
I was watching his challenge video.

216
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:34,332
He was supposed to use his protruding front teeth.

217
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,239
"Should I go daydrinking?" He should've done this.

218
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,409
But he wanted to look handsome, so he had his mouth closed.

219
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:41,332
(Pretending to be handsome with his mouth closed)

220
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,903
Why on earth did you do that?

221
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,403
(Gosh, these guys...)

222
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,519
That annoyed me so much. When he's with us, he does this.

223
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:47,543
(This is how he is usually.)

224
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:49,464
- He should've done this instead.
- You're good.

225
00:06:49,673 --> 00:06:51,782
(Making a face to look attractive)

226
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:54,452
(Doing his best to conceal his front teeth)

227
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:57,323
Hear me out. I did this when I first started.

228
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:58,952
- But people from my agency said, - What?

229
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:01,022
"You're doing the challenge with idol stars."

230
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:02,892
"Try to look handsome."

231
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:03,893
That's when it began.

232
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:05,662
I realized I shouldn't open my mouth.

233
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:07,632
But you're known for your teeth. You ought to show them.

234
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:08,792
- I'm sorry about that.
- But you closed your mouth.

235
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:10,232
- You must be yourself.
- Right.

236
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:13,902
All right. Since it's May, the Family Month,

237
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:16,202
our trip this week will be quite special.

238
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,242
- A special trip.
- Really?

239
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:19,473
Some people invited us to Chilgok.

240
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,873
- To Chilgok?
- Yes.

241
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:23,019
- Let me give you the invitations.
- Is it the priest?

242
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,043
- Really?
- Yes.

243
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,342
- To Chilgok?
- It means we'll have guests.

244
00:07:25,343 --> 00:07:26,343
Okay.

245
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:28,252
Some people wanted us to be here.

246
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:29,753
What's that? An invitation?

247
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:31,422
It says, "Students."

248
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:32,452
- What? Students?
- Read it.

249
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:35,822
"Invitation. Hello. We're students living..."

250
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:37,762
- "in Utgat Village."
- "Utgat."

251
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:39,562
- "We learned Korean..."
- How cute.

252
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:40,662
"at the village hall."

253
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:42,233
"That's how we can write this letter."

254
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,772
"It would be a delight if your show could visit our village."

255
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:48,473
- "It would be a delight."
- "Thank you."

256
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:49,733
"Chu Yu Eul."

257
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,672
- "Chu Yu Eul."
- "It would be a delight."

258
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:52,942
It should be said like this.

259
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:53,943
- Like the old days.
- Yes.

260
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:55,112
- That's what elders would say.
- Right.

261
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:56,272
- That's true.
- Chu Yu Eul.

262
00:07:56,273 --> 00:07:57,942
- There's a poem.
- There's a poem too?

263
00:07:57,943 --> 00:07:58,943
"Writing."

264
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,583
- "Writing" is the title.
- Okay.

265
00:08:00,753 --> 00:08:01,953
By Park Jum Soon.

266
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:05,183
"Now that I have to write a poem, I feel lost."

267
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,193
"I don't know the letters. What do you want me to do?"

268
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,362
- "I don't know the letters."
- Is that an old lady?

269
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:12,762
But she spelled it F-E-A-L.

270
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:13,763
- F-E-A-L.
- F-E-A-L.

271
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:15,192
Not F-E-E-L. It's F-E-A-L.

272
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:17,502
She used the wrong pairing. And she wrote, "wont," not "want."

273
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:18,962
- "What do you wont me to do?"
- "What do you wont me to do?"

274
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:21,032
- She might be an elder.
- Is she an elder?

275
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,702
- Did elders invite us?
- Is it the elders?

276
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,672
They wrote heartfelt letters, didn't they?

277
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,612
- Yes.
- That's why we're here today.

278
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:28,613
- Really?
- I see.

279
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:30,542
- They sent us the letter for real?
- Yes.

280
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,683
- Really?
- Yes.

281
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:33,552
- The name of today's trip is...
- Yes.

282
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:35,983
Chilgok Ever After.

283
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,652
- Chilgok Ever After.
- Chilgok Ever After.

284
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:39,483
- Yes.
- It sounds heartwarming and sweet.

285
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:42,099
Just like you used to visit your grandmother in the countryside,

286
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:45,023
you will be their grandson as well as their son...

287
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:46,862
- for the day.
- I see.

288
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:48,493
- That will be today's trip.
- What?

289
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,862
Hey, grandmothers give you a lot of food.

290
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,402
- Yes. They give you a lot of food.
- Right.

291
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:54,132
- Yes.
- They warm up your room too.

292
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,302
Then it sounds like we won't be annoyed today.

293
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,879
- That's the feeling I have.
- Well, you might be.

294
00:08:57,903 --> 00:09:00,213
Who knows? We might be annoyed by the grannies.

295
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:02,242
- We can't have that.
- While playing cards?

296
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,483
- Yes. By the grannies.
- Gosh.

297
00:09:03,813 --> 00:09:05,942
Let's go and spend a special time...

298
00:09:05,943 --> 00:09:07,312
- with them.
- We're leaving right away?

299
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,352
- We can just leave now?
- Yes, you can.

300
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:10,013
- Just like this?
- Let's get going.

301
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:13,083
Korean show with a real human touch.

302
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,593
We're mischievous.

303
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:16,123
We're playful.

304
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,793
Here we come.

305
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:19,293
Who are we?

306
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:20,593
2 Days...

307
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,863
- 1 Night.
- 1 Night.

308
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:25,033
Oh, my bottom!

309
00:09:27,873 --> 00:09:29,872
(Perhaps, our very first trip might have been to our grandma's.)

310
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:30,873
Let's go.

311
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:34,243
Did you not go to your grandparents' house during holidays?

312
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:36,312
- We visited our grandparents a lot.
- We did.

313
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:37,942
My grandparents were in Yeongcheon, North Gyeongsang Province.

314
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:39,342
- Yeongcheon.
- I see.

315
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:40,712
- Yeongcheon, Gyeongsang Province.
- What about yours, Jong Min?

316
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,713
Gongju.

317
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:45,022
Actually, my grandmother's house was quite close.

318
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:49,023
Going to my grandmother's house would mean going to Gwangmyeong.

319
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:51,422
- I was envious of my friends.
- When they traveled far?

320
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:53,222
- During holidays, - Going to the countryside?

321
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:55,533
Families would sit on the bench together,

322
00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:57,832
- Eating watermelons.
- grill meat, and eat watermelons.

323
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,802
- They'd go to a brook...
- Right.

324
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:01,532
- and catch fish.
- Yes.

325
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,003
I didn't have those memories.

326
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:04,272
They didn't even cook.

327
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:06,602
We went to a barbecue restaurant during holidays.

328
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:08,212
The restaurant was so empty.

329
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:09,912
We used to eat meat at the barbecue restaurant.

330
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:12,442
But that's your memory with your grandmother.

331
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:13,582
- Right.
- Yes.

332
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,252
But I was shocked by my grandmother's house...

333
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:16,882
the first time I visited her.

334
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,283
We went to her house in Yeonggwang.

335
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:21,693
There was a tile-roofed house in the mountains.

336
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,292
I said, "My gosh, this is so cool."

337
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:25,393
This is the first memory of my grandmother.

338
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,833
She said, "Gosh, my grandson is here."

339
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:30,232
"I prepared a lot of things for you."

340
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,003
- There was a huge chicken.
- Yes.

341
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:33,262
- It looked so scary.
- Yes.

342
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:34,272
- She grabbed it...
- Did she kill it?

343
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:36,633
- and twisted its neck on the spot.
- She did that?

344
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:38,572
- I was so shocked by that.
- That's scary.

345
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,103
- I see.
- Right? I was like, "What?"

346
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:42,312
This is what the chicken did. "No!"

347
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:43,813
- Right.
- I'm serious.

348
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,443
(Bellowing)

349
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,483
So...

350
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,582
that was such a shocking moment.

351
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,323
Gosh, Joon's stories are funny today.

352
00:10:50,553 --> 00:10:52,282
You must have slept a lot last night.

353
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:54,823
I had a good night's sleep. Yes, I did.

354
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,192
Are there any nostalgic dishes...

355
00:10:56,193 --> 00:10:58,122
from your visits to your grandmother's house?

356
00:10:58,123 --> 00:10:59,262
- A dish comes to mind right away.
- What is it?

357
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:00,943
- Even my mom can't copy it.
- What is it?

358
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,862
- It's braised spicy sand eel.
- Sand eels?

359
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,002
- You know sand eels, right?
- Sand eels.

360
00:11:04,003 --> 00:11:05,702
- The one with a lot of roe?
- She braised them with soy sauce,

361
00:11:05,703 --> 00:11:08,172
- gochujang, and radishes.
- That sounds so good.

362
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:09,173
Okay.

363
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:12,743
Even my mom can't make it taste like my grandmother's.

364
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,212
- Right.
- The sand eel dish...

365
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:16,312
- reminds me of my grandma.
- Sand eels are so tasty.

366
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:17,512
Only my grandma could cook it.

367
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:18,882
There's something about grandmas' food.

368
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:20,012
Right. There's that certain flavor.

369
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,529
- My maternal grandfather...
- The flavor of nostalgia.

370
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:23,313
- was from North Korea.
- Yes.

371
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:25,752
- Really?
- My grandmother always made...

372
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,393
- dumplings during holidays.
- Dumplings?

373
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:29,452
- The North Korean style dumplings.
- She made meat dumplings...

374
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:30,662
and kimchi dumplings.

375
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:32,562
- I bet she added mung bean sprouts.
- Yes. They were huge.

376
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:33,769
- The dumplings are huge.
- That sounds so good.

377
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,492
I can't forget the flavor of her dumplings.

378
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:37,762
My grandma's dumplings.

379
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,379
(They were big and filling just like his grandmother's love for him.)

380
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:43,132
(They're nearing the destination as they chat.)

381
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:45,273
Hold on. I have a question about our destination.

382
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:48,413
Did we receive the invitation from one elderly lady?

383
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,713
Didn't it say, "Students?"

384
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,513
- It says, "Students."
- Yes.

385
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,013
When I read the poem, I could tell...

386
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,422
- she would be a bold type.
- Right.

387
00:11:58,423 --> 00:12:00,222
She sounds like a bold lady.

388
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:01,223
"What do you want me to do?"

389
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:03,092
"Now that I have to write a poem, I feel lost."

390
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:04,622
"I don't know the letters. What do you want me to do?"

391
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,269
- That was it, right?
- "I don't know the letters."

392
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,632
(The last line is the highlight.)

393
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:10,062
"What do you want me to do?"

394
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,762
- But...
- "What do you want me to do?"

395
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:13,563
(Who are the people waiting for the members?)

396
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:16,673
(They arrive at the destination with anticipation.)

397
00:12:17,243 --> 00:12:22,142
(A rustic village with a friendly atmosphere)

398
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,442
(The 12th Happy Village in Chilgok)

399
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:25,512
- My gosh. This place...
- Oh, my.

400
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:27,082
This place definitely feels rustic, right?

401
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,912
- Yes, there should be barking dogs.
- The dogs are welcoming us.

402
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:30,012
- The dogs.
- Of course.

403
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:32,153
- They have big dogs here.
- Woof!

404
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:34,323
Hello.

405
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:35,352
(The puppy in the countryside welcomes them intensely.)

406
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:36,692
- It's a cozy village, right?
- My gosh.

407
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:37,693
- All right, everyone.
- I love it.

408
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:39,214
- The puppies are welcoming us.
- Yes.

409
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:42,792
This is Utgat Village, the home of the ladies.

410
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,132
- Utgat.
- Utgat.

411
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:45,662
- Utgat.
- Utgat.

412
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:46,932
(Utgat Village)

413
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,872
It means a branch of a plum blossom tree.

414
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:51,879
- That's what Utgat means?
- Yes, we're at Utgat Village.

415
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:53,402
(Like the flowers on the tip of the branch, )

416
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:56,012
(the village is filled with lovely fragrances.)

417
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:57,013
(Utgat Village)

418
00:12:57,014 --> 00:12:58,912
(Come and check out our village, a great place to live.)

419
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:00,653
I will give you the map...

420
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:02,752
to the house where you will stay for the day.

421
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:03,922
- We must find it ourselves?
- I see.

422
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:05,822
You will split into 2 teams of 3.

423
00:13:05,823 --> 00:13:07,192
- What?
- Gather the ladies...

424
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,552
and meet us back at the village hall.

425
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:09,553
Two teams of three?

426
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:10,892
Yes. Se Yoon, Joon, and DinDin...

427
00:13:10,893 --> 00:13:12,962
will stay at Ms. Ok Geum's house.

428
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:13,963
- Se Yoon.
- Se Yoon.

429
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:16,062
Jong Min, Sae Ho, and Seon Ho...

430
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,603
will stay at Ms. Pil Sun's house.

431
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:19,632
I think the ladies drew the maps.

432
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,803
- That's correct.
- They drew the map themselves.

433
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:23,772
This is the hint. Is that the persimmon tree?

434
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:26,202
There's a red tree here. Is that a tangerine tree?

435
00:13:26,203 --> 00:13:27,642
Is that a puppy, dog, or pig?

436
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:29,113
- Is there a cattle farm?
- Okay.

437
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:30,912
- Look. That's the path.
- It's here.

438
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:33,213
- We should hold it this way.
- We can go that way.

439
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:34,882
- That way...
- But...

440
00:13:34,883 --> 00:13:36,443
the blue house... Is that Gyeongsudang?

441
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:38,022
(Current location: The village hall)

442
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:40,023
- We'll get going.
- Let's go.

443
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:41,543
- Let's go.
- All right, let's go.

444
00:13:42,123 --> 00:13:44,622
- I think we can go this way.
- Yes, we can go this way.

445
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:48,032
It's not that way. They don't look like houses.

446
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:50,033
- Is that the house?
- I think this is the house.

447
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,533
I'm getting a feeling that this is the house.

448
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,902
- I think this is the house.
- It's this one?

449
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,303
- Knock first.
- Okay.

450
00:13:57,743 --> 00:13:58,903
Hello.

451
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,073
(Hello)

452
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:03,113
Who's that?

453
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:04,413
Open the door and come in.

454
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:06,683
She told us to come in.

455
00:14:06,883 --> 00:14:08,052
Gosh, hello.

456
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:09,412
- Hello.
- Hello.

457
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:11,482
- Is this Ms. Lee Pil Sun's house?
- Ms. Lee Pil Sun.

458
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,823
- Yes.
- Is that you?

459
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:14,052
Yes, I am.

460
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,792
- Gosh, hello.
- Goodness. Hello.

461
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:16,822
Hello.

462
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:17,962
(We found our grandma.)

463
00:14:17,963 --> 00:14:18,963
Gosh, look at your house.

464
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:21,662
- You have a beautiful home.
- You have a farm field here.

465
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:22,733
Gosh, this is amazing.

466
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,263
- Hello.
- Hello.

467
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:27,843
(She turned the front yard into a garden.)

468
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:31,903
(Grandma Pil Sun farmed chives and raised flowers wholeheartedly.)

469
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:36,073
(A cozy, homey spot where the warmth of a rustic life is evident)

470
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:39,682
I saw you on TV. So I recognize your face.

471
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:40,853
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

472
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:42,682
- Thank you.
- Come on in.

473
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:45,082
- May we come in?
- Yes, come on in.

474
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,083
- Gosh.
- Come in.

475
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:48,392
- Gosh, nice to meet you.
- I live alone here.

476
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:51,022
(Excuse us.)

477
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,023
Gosh, seriously.

478
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,362
- Gosh.
- I can see her history here.

479
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:54,862
This reminds me of my grandmother's place.

480
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:55,893
- Yes.
- Of course.

481
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,932
- Yes. Let's go this way.
- Okay.

482
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,263
We can turn back if we're wrong.

483
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,433
How about a game? The loser carries...

484
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:02,154
- all the bags just like old times?
- Sure.

485
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,249
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

486
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:05,303
- No!
- Okay.

487
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:09,143
(Joon always ends up losing games like this.)

488
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,019
They found their grandma. How I envy them.

489
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,642
- They did?
- The blue gate.

490
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:14,183
It should be on the left, right?

491
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:15,453
The intersection.

492
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,323
We were right. I see the blue gate.

493
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:18,722
- But you...
- The blue gate.

494
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:20,023
This is the house.

495
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:21,452
- The blue gate, yes.
- The blue gate.

496
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,422
- Joon, it's over.
- Did you find the house?

497
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,769
- The blue gate. My gosh.
- This is the house.

498
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,323
- It really has a blue gate.
- Yes.

499
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:27,632
- Gosh.
- Come in.

500
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,769
Look at the garden. I guess she still tends the garden.

501
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:32,109
- I see chili peppers and pumpkins.
- This is a big house.

502
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:33,433
This is a great house.

503
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,702
(A house with a blue gate...)

504
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,843
(and a bright orange roof)

505
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:41,212
She planted garlic chives in the garden.

506
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:43,812
(Her preferences are shown all over the garden.)

507
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:44,843
Ma'am.

508
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:46,683
Ma'am.

509
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,529
- Ms. Jang Ok Geum?

I've seen you on TV.

537
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,533

545
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:48,812
We were told we were going to stay here today.

00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,452
Let's go inside.

550
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:55,582
(They will unload first before going to the village hall.)

551
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,713
Can you give us a tour?

552
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:59,323
- May we come in?
- Should we put them in here?

553
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:01,423
(A spacious living room)

554
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:02,993
Gosh, the bed is right here.

555
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:04,263
I guess you watch TV here.

556
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:06,293
(Oh, my)

557
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:09,032
(The members will stay in this room.)

558
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:11,033
Then do you sleep in here?

559
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,133
- Yes.
- While watching TV?

560
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,973
- Is this a stone bed?
- It's just me here, so...

561
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,672
- Let's go.
- Let's go to the village hall.

562
00:17:17,673 --> 00:17:18,772
The senior citizen center. I mean, the village hall.

563
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,242
- Off to the senior citizen center.
- Should I put it here?

564
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:22,442
- Off to the senior citizen center.
- Let's go.

565
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:23,813
Okay. Let's go.

00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:25,942
- His name is Jong Min.
- Jong Min.

567
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:26,983
My name is...

568
00:17:27,553 --> 00:17:28,553
Sae Ho.

569
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:30,252
I'll forget them again. Write them for me.

570
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:31,722
- Let's write them.
- Write them.

571
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:33,403
You can call him Yangbaechu as in cabbage.

572
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,152
- Cabbage is good too.
- Won't that be easier?

573
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:37,292
You can be Green Onion or Garlic.

574
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:38,763
You can be Webfoot Octopus.

575
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:40,323
So...

576
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:42,004
- To make it easy.
- Yes, to make it easy.

577
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:44,163
I'm quite forgetful.

578
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,602
- You are?
- I tend to forget things easily.

579
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:49,132
- His name is Jong Min.
- Yes.

580
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,402
- You might get his name wrong.
- Yes.

581
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,502
So call him Webfoot Octopus.

582
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,672
- Webfoot Octopus?
- Yes, Webfoot Octopus.

583
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:53,703
Webfoot Octopus.

584
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:55,542
How can I call him Webfoot Octopus?

585
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:57,072
- It's okay. It's just a joke.
- But...

586
00:17:57,073 --> 00:17:58,282
- My name is...
- Okay.

587
00:17:58,283 --> 00:17:59,342

00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:00,882
- Call me Cabbage to keep it simple.

589
00:18:00,883 --> 00:18:02,182
Yes. Call me that.

590
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:03,552
I won't forget that name.

591
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:05,483
Right. What was his name?

592
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:07,569
- It was Webfoot Octopus, right?
- Webfoot Octopus.

593
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:09,023

597
00:18:12,663 --> 00:18:13,722
Garlic, Cabbage,

598
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:14,762
- and Webfoot Octopus.
- That's hard.

599
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:16,863
- Okay.
- He's Cabbagey. You are...

600
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,163
- Garlic.
- Garlic.

601
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,172
In Gyeongsang Province, people say Cabbagey.

602
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:22,672
- That's right.
- Yes.

603
00:18:22,673 --> 00:18:23,702
- Yes.
- Let's go now.

604
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,242
- Then can we leave...
- Let's go.

605
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:26,603
Our stuff here?

606
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:28,842
Yes, you can. There are no thieves in our village.

607
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:30,803
(It's fine. There are no thieves in our village.)

608
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,682
- Let's go to the center.
- Yes, let's go.

609
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:34,559
(Team Pil Sun also sets out to the village hall.)

610
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,482
Gosh, the other team is probably already at the hall.

611
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,163
- They found the house before us.
- Right.

612
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:40,322
- All right. We're here.
- Okay.

613
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:41,892

615
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,322

00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:25,832
- It was fun.
- Gosh, we had no idea...

638
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,393
- we'd be meeting celebrities.
- Right.

639
00:19:27,603 --> 00:19:29,803
May I ask which one of you wrote the invitation to us?

640
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,543
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

641
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,142

Ms. Chu Yu Eul.

00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:38,213
"Writing."

646
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:39,312
She wrote that.

647
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:40,412

648
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,283
- The poem was great.

649
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:43,452
"What do you want me to do?"

650
00:19:43,453 --> 00:19:45,382
(The poet of the unconventional poem)

651
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:46,422
"What do you want me to do?"

652
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:48,993
Does anyone here know who we are?

653
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:51,022
We don't know your names, but we've seen you on TV.

Does anyone know our names?

655

677
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,013
(With her eyes fixed on Jong Min, )

678
00:20:30,014 --> 00:20:32,174
(the old lady approaches him and falls into his arms.)

679
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,823
(You're the only one I see.)

680
00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:37,593
All the ladies got up because Jong Min is here.

681
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:39,093
- Hello.
- Hello.

682
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:40,763
You couldn't go on your honeymoon.

683
00:20:40,764 --> 00:20:41,923
- Right, I couldn't.
- Congratulations on your marriage.

684
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:42,934
Thank you.

685
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:45,294
They know everything about Jong Min.

686
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:47,864
Please have a seat.

687
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:49,033
- Please sit.
- Yes.

688
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:50,133
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

689
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:51,134
(Now that everyone is here, let's sit down comfortably.)

690
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:53,103
You invited us here.

691
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:55,003
- Right.
- We feel very grateful.

692
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,513
(Just then, her phone rings.)

693
00:20:56,514 --> 00:20:58,643
- She wrote the invitation.
- Really?

694
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:00,344
- After watching it...
- Right.

695
00:21:00,514 --> 00:21:02,484
Please feel free to answer your phone.

696
00:21:02,754 --> 00:21:04,354
I'm at a shoot right now.

697
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:08,454
(Seeing this in person)

698
00:21:09,154 --> 00:21:10,223
I'm at a shoot.

699
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:11,554
(Her pose looks very familiar.)

700
00:21:11,924 --> 00:21:14,923
(The reality has been ascertained.)

701
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:17,210
- Now that I learned how to write...
- That pose actually exists.

702
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,003
When you get up in the morning,

703
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:21,703
- do you gather here?
- Yes.

704
00:21:21,704 --> 00:21:25,633
We lie down, take naps, chat, and have fun.

705
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:27,343
We go out to get some fresh air.

706
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:28,643
- And have some tea?
- Yes.

707
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:30,513
When the Korean alphabet teacher comes to teach us,

708
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:32,613
we learn how to write.

709
00:21:32,614 --> 00:21:34,944
- She's the Korean alphabet teacher?
- Yes, she is.

710
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:36,853
She's a teacher.

711
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:39,584
Thanks to her, I learned how to read and write.

712
00:21:39,824 --> 00:21:41,383
Before then, I was illiterate.

713
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,523
- You didn't know the alphabet?
- Not at all.

714
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:45,394
When I had to take public transport...

715
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:47,564
When I had to take the bus,

716
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,034
I didn't know where the bus was going.

717
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:52,033
But now, I know which bus to take.

718
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:53,434
(Laughing)

719
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:55,334
That's exciting.

720
00:21:56,034 --> 00:22:02,543
(At age 80, they started to learn how to read and write.)

721
00:22:02,544 --> 00:22:04,984
(In the month of June when I was 12 during the Korean War...)

722
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:10,553
(Now they can read the bus route at the bus station.)

723
00:22:10,554 --> 00:22:12,583
Now I can write my name anywhere.

724
00:22:12,584 --> 00:22:13,683
(They can write their names now.)

725
00:22:13,684 --> 00:22:15,653
(Writing by Park Jum Soon)

726
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:18,293
(I'd be happy if 2 Days 1 Night came to our village.)

727
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:21,164
That's why you could invite us, and we're here.

728
00:22:21,594 --> 00:22:22,893
Give them a round of applause.

729
00:22:22,894 --> 00:22:24,234
(Applauding together)

730
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:26,764
Yes.

731
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:29,264
(Chilgok Ever After)

732
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:32,504
(With Chilgok ladies)

733
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:34,774
(Is this a dream or reality?)

734
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:37,114
(The strongest in Korea)

735
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:38,514
(Nonsense)

736
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:40,014
(Real)

737
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:43,713
(I'm so happy.)

738
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:44,714
Here you go.

739
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:48,324
(Human)

740
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:52,024
(Variety)

741
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:53,323
She's having a lot of fun, and she's very happy.

742
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:55,493
(Full of affection)

743
00:22:55,494 --> 00:22:59,164
(A special time with a lot of excitement)

744
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:04,603
(Chilgok Episode on 2 Days 1 Night)

745
00:23:04,604 --> 00:23:08,573
(The story unfolds now.)

746
00:23:08,574 --> 00:23:10,543
- It's a little windy.
- Isn't it chilly?

747
00:23:10,544 --> 00:23:11,943
It's cold and windy.

748
00:23:11,944 --> 00:23:13,183
- We'll move now.
- It's cold.

749
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,483
Aren't you cold?

750
00:23:14,484 --> 00:23:17,813
I'm embarrassed to be dressed warmly when I'm the youngest.

751
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,083
(Chu Yu Eul, age 91, is laughing.)

752
00:23:19,084 --> 00:23:20,223
They're walking in a row while holding hands.

753
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:21,553
- They look so cute.
- Yes.

754
00:23:21,554 --> 00:23:22,583
Hand in hand.

755
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:24,653
- Let me join you.
- Hold Jong Min's hand.

756
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,163
- Gosh.
- Jong Min's hand.

757
00:23:26,164 --> 00:23:27,294
Walk together.

758
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:28,723
Isn't this better?

759
00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:31,534
I can't believe that it's really happening.

760
00:23:31,764 --> 00:23:33,563
Let's go hand in hand.

761
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:34,663
- Let's walk in a row.
- Shall we hold hands too?

762
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,003
- In a row.
- What? Okay.

763
00:23:36,004 --> 00:23:37,334
- In a row.
- All right.

764
00:23:37,534 --> 00:23:38,773
How old is your wife?

765
00:23:38,774 --> 00:23:40,804
My wife is 35 years old.

766
00:23:41,074 --> 00:23:42,274
She didn't get married late.

767
00:23:42,644 --> 00:23:44,373
- Things have changed now.
- Right.

768
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:45,913
- Please turn right.
- To the right.

769
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:48,214
- We will turn right.
- We will turn right.

770
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:50,013
- To the right.
- Let's go.

771
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:51,014
This way.

772
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:52,213
- What is this place?
- There they are.

773
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:54,124
- Is it someone's house?
- You may sit here.

774
00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:55,724
- Sit here?
- Yes.

775
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:57,424
On both sides.

776
00:23:58,254 --> 00:23:59,624
- Like this.
- In that case...

777
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:01,893
Hey, aren't you getting up?

778
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:03,534
Please sit here.

779
00:24:03,764 --> 00:24:04,794
"Aren't you getting up?"

780
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,503
- You brat.
- Please sit.

781
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:07,504
He's not always right in his mind.

782
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:09,363
You made her flustered.

783
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,403
She got your seat, didn't she?

784
00:24:10,404 --> 00:24:12,843
We will sit on your lap.

785
00:24:12,844 --> 00:24:13,844
(Laughing)

786
00:24:13,845 --> 00:24:14,873
Go ahead.

787
00:24:14,874 --> 00:24:16,003
(Chatty Cho)

788
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:17,313
- Like a grandson.
- You can sit on my lap.

789
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:18,944
- I know.
- Shouldn't you sit down too?

790
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:20,544
- It's okay.
- We're fine.

791
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:23,814
The ones who invited us here today are...

792
00:24:23,954 --> 00:24:25,313
the ladies who are learning...

793
00:24:25,314 --> 00:24:27,683
the Korean alphabet in Utgat Village.

794
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:28,684
Yes.

795
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:30,493
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you for inviting us.

796
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:31,553
- Thank you.
- Ladies.

797
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:34,463
Please introduce yourselves 1 by 1.

798
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:36,363
- Please introduce yourself.
- Introduce yourself.

799
00:24:36,364 --> 00:24:37,533
I'll start.

800
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:38,663
(Getting up)

801
00:24:38,664 --> 00:24:40,464
My name is Chu Yu Eul.

802
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:42,604
(Chu Yu Eul, age 91, the eldest)

803
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:44,604
She wrote the invitation.

804
00:24:45,204 --> 00:24:47,774
I'm 80 years old.

805
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,674
- My name is Lee Ok Ja.
- Ok.

806
00:24:49,774 --> 00:24:50,844
Ok Ja.

807
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:54,484
I'm 77 years old, and I'm Lee Seon Hwa.

808
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:56,013
- Lee Seon Hwa.
- Thank you.

809
00:24:56,014 --> 00:24:58,783
I'm 77 years old, and I'm Jang Ok Geum.

810
00:24:58,784 --> 00:24:59,784
Ok Geum.

811
00:24:59,784 --> 00:25:00,784
(She invited Joon, DinDin, and Se Yoon to her house for the night.)

812
00:25:00,784 --> 00:25:01,784
Ok Geum.

813
00:25:01,785 --> 00:25:04,154
I'm 80 years old, and I'm Kim Tae Hee.

814
00:25:05,154 --> 00:25:06,564
Kim Tae Hee.

815
00:25:07,124 --> 00:25:09,163
My name is Park Jum Soon.

816
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:10,733
(Park Jum Soon, age 84, number 1 in charisma)

817
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:12,533
My name is Hong Soon Yeon.

818
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:14,233
(Hong Soon Yeon, age 84, number 1 in free spirit)

819
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:16,904
I'm 88 years old, and I'm Lee Pil Sun.

820
00:25:17,034 --> 00:25:18,334
- All right.
- Yes.

821
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:20,074
This is great.

822
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:22,150
Have they been learning the Korean alphabet for nine years?

823
00:25:22,174 --> 00:25:23,373
Nine years? That's a long time.

824
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:26,644
They've been learning it together for 8 to 9 years.

825
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,643
This is...

826
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:30,913
Ms. Kim Tae Hee's exercise book.

827
00:25:30,914 --> 00:25:32,313
- Ms. Kim Tae Hee.
- In here,

828
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:35,954
you'll see what the ladies wrote by hand.

829
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:39,153
You'll also find their poems.

830
00:25:39,154 --> 00:25:41,723
- The poems almost made me cry.
- Poems?

831
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:43,534
She fled when she was 12.

832
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:45,464
This is history.

833
00:25:45,734 --> 00:25:47,463
They're also learning the time tables.

834
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:48,634
The two times table.

835
00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:50,704
Whose poem is it?

836
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:52,973
Where is Ms. Park Jum Soon?

837
00:25:52,974 --> 00:25:54,843
- Ms. Jum Soon is...
- Ms. Jum Soon.

838
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,343
- good at writing poems.
- Yes.

839
00:25:56,344 --> 00:25:57,913
Her poems are amazing.

840
00:25:57,914 --> 00:25:59,313
- "What do you want me to do?"
- Her poems are lovely.

841
00:25:59,314 --> 00:26:01,194
- Yes, they are.
- Can you read the poem aloud?

842
00:26:02,114 --> 00:26:03,553
(Reading carefully)

843
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:04,714
Don't cry. He's going to cry.

844
00:26:04,784 --> 00:26:05,813
- What's wrong?
- Really?

845
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:06,823
(Shaking his head)

846
00:26:06,824 --> 00:26:07,983
It's sad.

847
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,523
- How so?
- Why is the poem so sad?

848
00:26:09,524 --> 00:26:10,753
- Hurry up and read it.
- Please read it aloud, Jong Min.

849
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:12,493
(What will the poem be about?)

850
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:14,493
Written by Park Jum Soon.

851
00:26:14,494 --> 00:26:15,593
(Park Jum Soon)

852
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:16,694
It's called "Rain."

853
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:18,734
"It rained a lot."

854
00:26:19,604 --> 00:26:22,804
"So I planted field seedlings."

855
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:25,903
"Doing it in the rain was..."

856
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:29,304
"very tiring."

857
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:32,714
"When I returned home,"

858
00:26:32,914 --> 00:26:35,344
- Because I got home late.
- "my husband scolded me..."

859
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:38,154
"for coming home late. It makes me sad."

860
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:41,084
"After having dinner,"

861
00:26:41,324 --> 00:26:43,594
"I watched TV before going to bed."

862
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:46,540
- I sound like a first grader.
- Did your husband scold you?

863
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,094
I got home late when it was raining.

864
00:26:48,264 --> 00:26:49,933
- She got back late.
- That's why he scolded me.

865
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:51,434
- He was worried about her.
- I see.

866
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:53,503
What do you mean by "field seedlings?"

867
00:26:53,504 --> 00:26:55,263
I meant perilla seeds to make oil.

868
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:56,403
Perilla oil.

869
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:58,234
- Perilla oil?
- I came late from working.

870
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,203
That's why I got home late.

871
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:02,404
Now I'll read a poem written by Writer Kim Tae Hee.

872
00:27:02,644 --> 00:27:05,214
I'll read "Persimmon Tree" by Writer Kim Tae Hee.

873
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:06,760
- "Persimmon Tree."
- Read it out loud.

874
00:27:06,784 --> 00:27:08,714
"Persimmon Tree" by Kim Tae Hee.

875
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:13,354
"There are three persimmon trees by the wall of my house."

876
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:17,494
"Ten years ago, you planted them yourself."

877
00:27:18,194 --> 00:27:21,264
"Now they became tall, and many persimmons hang from them."

878
00:27:21,924 --> 00:27:23,134
"They remind me of you."

879
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:25,334
"In autumn this year,"

880
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:28,904
"my children plan to enjoy them again."

881
00:27:29,674 --> 00:27:31,773
- The "you" in the poem...
- Bravo. Well done.

882
00:27:31,774 --> 00:27:34,104
Did your husband plant them?

883
00:27:34,674 --> 00:27:36,173
- After he planted them, - After planting them...

884
00:27:36,174 --> 00:27:37,313
he passed away shortly.

885
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:40,784
- He passed away within two years.
- Right.

886
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:44,253
(Their sensitivity is surprising the more you read their writing.)

887
00:27:44,254 --> 00:27:46,114
It's very long.

888
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:48,623
Do you think a lot about your late husband?

889
00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:49,894
Yes, of course.

890
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:52,094
- The trees grew tall already.
- It's sad.

891
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:55,693
Writer Kim Tae Hee is very creative.

892
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:58,094
Yes, she's talented in writing poetry.

893
00:27:58,294 --> 00:27:59,634
Please,

894
00:28:00,564 --> 00:28:02,603
could you read this from here?

895
00:28:02,604 --> 00:28:05,734
The end of the poem resonates in my heart.

896
00:28:06,544 --> 00:28:10,144
"When I was young, my friends went to school."

897
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:15,484
"While squatting down by the wall,"

898
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:17,214
- "I was crying."
- Why?

899
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:19,884
"Washing dishes and babysitting."

900
00:28:20,484 --> 00:28:22,884
- "That's my duty."
- Gosh.

901
00:28:23,154 --> 00:28:24,154
"It drives me insane."

902
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:26,993
Like rap,

903
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:29,223
the words rhyme in her poem.

904
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:30,434
Who wrote this poem?

905
00:28:30,934 --> 00:28:32,263
- Ms. Tae Hee.
- There's no name on it.

906
00:28:32,264 --> 00:28:33,334
- Now...
- Ms. Tae Hee?

907
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:35,763
You're exactly like Ae Sun.

908
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:37,003
Yes, she really is.

909
00:28:37,004 --> 00:28:38,403
If you had been born later,

910
00:28:38,404 --> 00:28:40,844
you'd be good at writing songs.

911
00:28:41,074 --> 00:28:43,073
Could you read this, DinDin? I can't read it.

912
00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:44,543
DinDin, please read it.

913
00:28:44,544 --> 00:28:45,713
(He passes it on to DinDin.)

914
00:28:45,714 --> 00:28:48,484
For a long time, they've been...

915
00:28:48,984 --> 00:28:50,553
- wanting to learn.
- The lack...

916
00:28:50,554 --> 00:28:52,153
- of education...
- This must be why.

917
00:28:52,154 --> 00:28:53,724
They expressed it through their poems.

918
00:28:54,324 --> 00:28:56,653
- This is very sad.
- It's not easy to read.

919
00:28:56,654 --> 00:28:58,494
- It's very hard to read.
- It's so sad.

920
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,793
- Gosh, this is...
- It's really sad.

921
00:29:00,794 --> 00:29:03,593
Writer Tae Hee, I'll read your poem.

922
00:29:03,594 --> 00:29:04,594
Go ahead.

923
00:29:04,595 --> 00:29:06,463
The poem is called "My Dream."

924
00:29:06,464 --> 00:29:08,003
- She writes well.
- She's a good writer.

925
00:29:08,004 --> 00:29:09,134
By Kim Tae Hee.

926
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:12,774
"After giving birth to me,"

927
00:29:13,444 --> 00:29:18,614
"why did Mom pass away so early without a sound?"

928
00:29:19,344 --> 00:29:21,144
"Inside my mom's skirt,"

929
00:29:21,444 --> 00:29:23,614
"my dream would have become beautiful."

930
00:29:24,684 --> 00:29:28,024
"Without being able to open his eyes,"

931
00:29:28,654 --> 00:29:31,154
"at age four, my youngest sibling was..."

932
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:32,923
- Goodness.
- "covered..."

933
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:34,924
- Ma'am.
- "in tears."

934
00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:36,664
"He was buried in the dark shade"

935
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:39,534
"With a sack of books attached to their waist,"

936
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:42,564
"Over the wall, I could see my friends going to school."

937
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:45,574
"My circumstances didn't allow me to follow them."

938
00:29:46,404 --> 00:29:49,504
"Instead, I squat down and wash dishes."

939
00:29:50,514 --> 00:29:53,614
"Not learning became a resentment for life."

940
00:29:54,284 --> 00:29:57,154
"One day after the age of 70."

941
00:29:58,654 --> 00:30:00,083
- Goodness.
- Oh, no.

942
00:30:00,084 --> 00:30:03,394
- Gosh.
- She's very poetic.

943
00:30:03,424 --> 00:30:04,593
(A surge of emotions)

944
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,564
I'm tearing up too.

945
00:30:07,524 --> 00:30:08,624
Ma'am.

946
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,304
I'm tearing up too.

947
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:18,704
(Taking a moment to calm down)

948
00:30:18,974 --> 00:30:20,003
Ma'am.

949
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:22,244
Your son will scold you when he sees it. Don't cry.

950
00:30:23,544 --> 00:30:26,944
Learning at a later age doesn't make her different. The depth...

951
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,313
- of her writing is different.
- I agree.

952
00:30:29,314 --> 00:30:31,253
Did your mother...

953
00:30:31,254 --> 00:30:32,884
It's making me cry too.

954
00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:34,754
Did she pass away early?

955
00:30:35,024 --> 00:30:36,624
- Yes.
- I'm tearing up too.

956
00:30:37,224 --> 00:30:40,964
She passed away when I was ten years old.

957
00:30:41,994 --> 00:30:45,333
After giving birth to my youngest sibling,

958
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:47,204
she passed away in the afternoon.

959
00:30:47,604 --> 00:30:49,833
I was told to write a poem...

960
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:53,174
about what I went through. I didn't know how to write.

961
00:30:53,444 --> 00:30:56,343
That's how my poem turned out.

962
00:30:56,344 --> 00:30:58,743
You must have envied your friends for going to school.

963
00:30:58,744 --> 00:31:01,213
Aren't you very glad to be able to learn now?

964
00:31:01,214 --> 00:31:03,854
- Of course.
- That's needless to say.

965
00:31:03,954 --> 00:31:08,723
I don't write well, but I just wrote exactly...

966
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:10,093
what I went through in life.

967
00:31:10,094 --> 00:31:11,724
You're extremely competent.

968
00:31:12,294 --> 00:31:14,163
When do you miss your mom the most?

969
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,423
Whenever I hear the word "mom,"

970
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:18,494
I tear up.

971
00:31:19,594 --> 00:31:22,063
I still miss her.

972
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:24,434
I miss my mom.

973
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,243
I'm tearing up.

974
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:30,944
(The two of them hide their tears behind the wall.)

975
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:32,214
Gosh, this is...

976
00:31:32,714 --> 00:31:34,743
Seriously, it hit me suddenly.

977
00:31:34,744 --> 00:31:39,114
(It's hard to calm down their emotions.)

978
00:31:41,124 --> 00:31:43,254
It's so intense. What do I do?

979
00:31:43,794 --> 00:31:47,263
The poem stirs emotions in the readers right away.

980
00:31:47,264 --> 00:31:48,563
- Right.
- Seriously,

981
00:31:48,564 --> 00:31:50,434
her words are so sincere.

982
00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:53,364
This is very moving, but I'm so embarrassed.

983
00:31:54,504 --> 00:31:56,334
I didn't expect myself...

984
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,544
Let me explain. After reading the poem...

985
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:04,174
She wrote it with so much care.

986
00:32:04,274 --> 00:32:06,114
Even though she made mistakes...

987
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:08,844
in spacing and spelling,

988
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:11,884
I wanted to read it well, so I kept reading it out loud.

989
00:32:12,384 --> 00:32:14,553
I felt relieved toward the end of reading.

990
00:32:14,554 --> 00:32:16,584
Then I understood the content of the poem.

991
00:32:16,924 --> 00:32:18,523
I thought, "She wrote so well."

992
00:32:18,524 --> 00:32:20,863
"I see what she's gone through."

993
00:32:20,864 --> 00:32:23,164
- Then I noticed her crying.
- Right.

994
00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:26,634
So her poem touched me completely.

995
00:32:27,634 --> 00:32:28,634
This is...

996
00:32:30,404 --> 00:32:32,074
"I'm a student now."

997
00:32:32,774 --> 00:32:34,644
"I'm an old student."

998
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,074
- It sounds like song lyrics.
- "I'm a student now."

999
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:39,773
"Someone who goes to school with a backpack."

1000
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:42,044
"Whose face and body are old."

1001
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:46,584
Just with one poem...

1002
00:32:46,984 --> 00:32:49,023
- Poems that make people cry are...
- Exactly.

1003
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:50,253
- very rare.
- I agree.

1004
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:52,023
- It made me cry all of a sudden.
- Honestly,

1005
00:32:52,024 --> 00:32:54,563
it'd be great to exhibit their poems.

1006
00:32:54,564 --> 00:32:56,763
The provincial office took our poems to exhibit them.

1007
00:32:56,764 --> 00:32:57,793
- Did they?
- I see.

1008
00:32:57,794 --> 00:32:59,234
(That's good news.)

1009
00:32:59,364 --> 00:33:01,363
Ma'am, don't let them take your poems for free.

1010
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:02,504
You should be paid.

1011
00:33:02,704 --> 00:33:03,704
(Laughing)

1012
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:05,103
As Ms. Yu Eul...

1013
00:33:05,104 --> 00:33:08,073
has nice handwriting, she has her own font.

1014
00:33:08,074 --> 00:33:09,704
- She has her own font?
- Really?

1015
00:33:10,014 --> 00:33:11,374
Is there Yu Eul font?

1016
00:33:11,474 --> 00:33:13,074
Ma'am, you should get paid for that.

1017
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:16,714
It's embarrassing. I don't know how to write.

1018
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,213
They were born...

1019
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:20,953
- when learning was a luxury.
- Right.

1020
00:33:20,954 --> 00:33:22,553
After supporting their children and husbands,

1021
00:33:22,554 --> 00:33:24,554
they finally get to learn now.

1022
00:33:24,954 --> 00:33:26,093
Gosh.

1023
00:33:26,094 --> 00:33:27,263
"I go to school with a backpack."

1024
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:28,963
- "I was ecstatic to hear..."
- What's this again?

1025
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:30,763
- Wait.
- She got a call.

1026
00:33:30,764 --> 00:33:31,893
- Could you put your phone...
- Go ahead and pick it up.

1027
00:33:31,894 --> 00:33:33,034
On vibrate during the shoot?

1028
00:33:33,234 --> 00:33:34,663
- Okay.
- Go ahead and pick it up.

1029
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:35,863
- Feel free to pick it up.
- Otherwise, they'll get worried.

1030
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:37,534
- Who's calling?
- You can pick it up.

1031
00:33:37,604 --> 00:33:39,710
- Ms. Bongcheon is calling.
- You should pick that up.

1032
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:42,873
Ms. Bongcheon, I'm at a shoot right now.

1033
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:43,874
(Laughing)

1034
00:33:45,044 --> 00:33:46,143
"I'm at a shoot."

1035
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:48,143
Whenever you get a call, don't worry and pick up.

1036
00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:50,414
Are you at a shoot often?

1037
00:33:50,554 --> 00:33:52,113
- Yes.
- Really?

1038
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:55,283
- Sometimes.
- Everyone sounds like a star.

1039
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:58,054
They pick up and say, "I'm at a shoot."

1040
00:33:58,724 --> 00:34:01,164
Everyone, starting now,

1041
00:34:01,194 --> 00:34:03,193
we'll play a simple game...

1042
00:34:03,194 --> 00:34:05,033
- to get to know the ladies better.
- Okay.

1043
00:34:05,034 --> 00:34:06,063
- Okay.
- That sounds good.

1044
00:34:06,064 --> 00:34:08,404
It just turns out that...

1045
00:34:08,864 --> 00:34:10,933
Ms. Seon Hwa has to plant chili seedlings today.

1046
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:12,734
- Is that so?
- It just turns out?

1047
00:34:12,874 --> 00:34:14,343
- It's time to plant them.
- You'll play a game.

1048
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,443
- It just turns out?
- Yes.

1049
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:17,943
Only the three of you will go and help.

1050
00:34:17,944 --> 00:34:19,443
We get to help? That's good.

1051
00:34:19,444 --> 00:34:21,143
They should have lunch first. What if they're hungry?

1052
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:22,943
- We should eat first.
- Of course.

1053
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:24,813
As we always do, we'll decide...

1054
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:27,053
- by playing a game.
- That sounds good.

1055
00:34:27,054 --> 00:34:29,924
The mission to select those who will help with the work is...

1056
00:34:30,324 --> 00:34:31,854
2 Days Entertainment.

1057
00:34:32,424 --> 00:34:33,800
- 2 Days Entertainment.
- 2 Days Entertainment.

1058
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:35,594
There will be a total of three rounds.

1059
00:34:35,794 --> 00:34:38,533
The 1st team to win 2 rounds...

1060
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,164
- will be the winner.
- Okay.

1061
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:42,734
Jong Min, Sae Ho, and Seon Ho will team up...

1062
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:45,833
with Pil Sun, Jum Soon, and Tae Hee.

1063
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,874
- Okay.
- Se Yoon, Joon, and DinDin...

1064
00:34:49,144 --> 00:34:52,213
will team up with Ok Geum, Seon Hwa, and Soon Yeon.

1065
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:53,214
- We're here.
- Okay.

1066
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:54,643
Once we finish setting it up,

1067
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:56,143
I will explain each round.

1068
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:57,854
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

1069
00:34:58,484 --> 00:35:00,883
(To 2 Days Entertainment)

1070
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:03,754
The mission for Round One is...

1071
00:35:03,954 --> 00:35:05,494
called 6 People, 1 Heart.

1072
00:35:05,554 --> 00:35:07,423
- It's 6 People, 1 Heart.
- It's 6 People, 1 Heart.

1073
00:35:07,424 --> 00:35:08,993
- It's 6 People, 1 Heart.
- Are we playing together?

1074
00:35:08,994 --> 00:35:10,023
We're one heart.

1075
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,863
Listen to the keyword that I give you.

1076
00:35:12,864 --> 00:35:14,703
Words that end with "bal."

1077
00:35:14,704 --> 00:35:17,373
Say the appropriate word starting with the first player.

1078
00:35:17,374 --> 00:35:18,433
(Answer in order starting with the first player)

1079
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:19,773
(Long-haired)

1080
00:35:19,774 --> 00:35:21,643
(Chicken feet)

1081
00:35:21,644 --> 00:35:23,443
- Select.
- You succeed once everyone answers.

1082
00:35:23,444 --> 00:35:24,773
(When everyone answers correctly, they win 1 point.)

1083
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:26,544
(The 1st team to gain 2 points wins.)

1084
00:35:26,914 --> 00:35:28,883
The first team to answer correthly...

1085
00:35:28,884 --> 00:35:29,884
"Correthly?"

1086
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:31,244
The team to answer correthly.

1087
00:35:31,414 --> 00:35:34,123
Let me try again. The first team to answer correctly...

1088
00:35:34,124 --> 00:35:35,683
- will get a chance to try.
- Okay.

1089
00:35:35,684 --> 00:35:38,823
If you get it wrong, the chance will go to the other team.

1090
00:35:38,824 --> 00:35:41,424
- Okay.
- The director can't talk very well.

1091
00:35:42,124 --> 00:35:43,163
You have to listen carefully.

1092
00:35:43,164 --> 00:35:44,193
(I see...)

1093
00:35:44,194 --> 00:35:45,564
He's bad at speaking Korean.

1094
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:48,504
Could he join your Korean class?

1095
00:35:49,704 --> 00:35:51,433
He's bad at speaking. He stammers a lot.

1096
00:35:51,434 --> 00:35:52,434
(Director Joo urgently needs to learn how to speak in Korean.)

1097
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:54,803
(He's a funny man.)

1098
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:56,674
Chang Sun, let's cheer for our team.

1099
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:58,473
Let's go, our team!

1100
00:35:58,474 --> 00:36:00,013
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1101
00:36:00,014 --> 00:36:01,484
We're going to win!

1102
00:36:01,884 --> 00:36:03,753
- Let's go!
- We're going to win.

1103
00:36:03,754 --> 00:36:05,053
- Let's go.
- Our team, we can do it.

1104
00:36:05,054 --> 00:36:06,153
Here we go.

1105
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:07,754
This is 6 People, 1 Heart.

1106
00:36:07,824 --> 00:36:09,884
- We'll start the mission.
- Okay.

1107
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,023
(The first question for 6 People, 1 Heart)

1108
00:36:12,024 --> 00:36:13,863
- Name types of flowers.
- I got it.

1109
00:36:13,864 --> 00:36:15,163
- Types of flowers.
- All right.

1110
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:16,293
- Name types of flowers.
- I got it.

1111
00:36:16,294 --> 00:36:17,694
(Gosh, I'm too late.)

1112
00:36:17,894 --> 00:36:18,934
Freesia.

1113
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:21,234
Rose.

1114
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:23,534
- Rape flower.
- Four o'clock flower.

1115
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:25,974
- Chrysanthemum.
- Azalea.

1116
00:36:26,304 --> 00:36:28,004
(Team Ok Geum gets the first question.)

1117
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:30,443
What? What did they say?

1118
00:36:30,444 --> 00:36:32,513
(Playing congratulatory music)

1119
00:36:32,514 --> 00:36:33,543
Whose song is it?

1120
00:36:33,544 --> 00:36:35,483
(They're getting excited.)

1121
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,253
Whose song is it?

1122
00:36:37,254 --> 00:36:39,414
- Whose song is it?
- I don't know. It doesn't matter.

1123
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:40,954
(Flinching)

1124
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:43,954
(They lost the game, but "Pitiful" is irresistible.)

1125
00:36:44,094 --> 00:36:45,153
Whose song is it?

1126
00:36:45,154 --> 00:36:47,823
(An exciting dance party)

1127
00:36:47,824 --> 00:36:50,193
Get your thumb ready. One, two, three, four.

1128
00:36:50,194 --> 00:36:51,593
(Pitiful)

1129
00:36:51,594 --> 00:36:52,863
They're good.

1130
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,933
(Showing off his front teeth out of joy)

1131
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:55,733
(Our team is the real deal)

1132
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:57,673
- Is this your move?
- No.

1133
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,774
(Chilgok ladies are full of excitement and talents.)

1134
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,074
They're so amazing.

1135
00:37:04,814 --> 00:37:06,743
- It's insane.
- You succeeded in one go.

1136
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:08,683
- They're so amazing.
- I'm sorry, but...

1137
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,743
They're the best.

1138
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:11,754
Can these be our regular members on the show?

1139
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:13,954
They're so much better.

1140
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:16,183
- Let's go.
- They're so good.

1141
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:17,193
(2 Days 1 Night)

1142
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,793
Everyone. Currently,

1143
00:37:18,794 --> 00:37:21,123
- Team Ok Geum is ahead with 1 to 0.
- Okay.

1144
00:37:21,124 --> 00:37:23,194
Here's the second question.

1145
00:37:23,264 --> 00:37:24,464
We must get it this time.

1146
00:37:24,964 --> 00:37:26,694
It'll be the same. Just keep it up.

1147
00:37:27,064 --> 00:37:29,003
- Words that start with "geo."
- Pil Sun.

1148
00:37:29,004 --> 00:37:30,350
- Words that start with "geo."
- Pil Sun.

1149
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:31,603
- Three.
- Goose.

1150
00:37:31,604 --> 00:37:33,204
- Goose.
- Mirror.

1151
00:37:33,604 --> 00:37:34,743
- Three.
- Street.

1152
00:37:34,744 --> 00:37:35,843
- Street.
- Street.

1153
00:37:35,844 --> 00:37:37,144
Geomungo.

1154
00:37:37,314 --> 00:37:40,844
- Three, two...
- What is it called?

1155
00:37:41,114 --> 00:37:43,143
- Geoje Island.
- Geoje Island.

1156
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:45,554
- Street.
- We already said that.

1157
00:37:45,684 --> 00:37:47,683
- How could you?
- What are you doing?

1158
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:49,183
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

1159
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,600
(Jong Min, the hole in Team Pil Sun)

1160
00:37:50,624 --> 00:37:52,293
- We already said that.
- Ok Geum.

1161
00:37:52,294 --> 00:37:54,063
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

1162
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,463
- Ok Geum.
- Go.

1163
00:37:55,464 --> 00:37:56,764
Castration.

1164
00:37:56,824 --> 00:37:58,433
- Goodness.
- Castration.

1165
00:37:58,434 --> 00:38:00,064
(What did you say?)

1166
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:02,403
(Bombarding him...)

1167
00:38:02,404 --> 00:38:03,633
(with criticism)

1168
00:38:03,634 --> 00:38:05,154
- What's wrong with that?
- Calm down.

1169
00:38:05,274 --> 00:38:07,143
Castration is correct, isn't it?

1170
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:08,543
Why would you say that?

1171
00:38:08,544 --> 00:38:09,603
What's wrong with that?

1172
00:38:09,604 --> 00:38:10,843
It is correct.

1173
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:13,444
- Castration isn't incorrect.
- Okay.

1174
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:14,813
Ms. Seon Hwa, it's your turn.

1175
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:15,814
- All right.
- Go ahead.

1176
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:17,783
- A word that starts with "geo."
- Two...

1177
00:38:17,784 --> 00:38:19,884
- Street.
- Geomungo.

1178
00:38:20,484 --> 00:38:21,984
- That was good.
- All right.

1179
00:38:22,624 --> 00:38:24,253
- Grand.
- Grand.

1180
00:38:24,254 --> 00:38:25,324
- Three...
- Goose.

1181
00:38:25,794 --> 00:38:27,424
- That's right.
- Beggar.

1182
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:29,123
(If Soon Yeon succeeds, )

1183
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:30,734
(Team Ok Geum will win Round 1.)

1184
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:33,708
(Will she make it?)

1185
00:38:33,893 --> 00:38:34,893
- Three...
- Goose.

1186
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,700
- That's right.
- Beggar.

1187
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,529
(If Soon Yeon succeeds, )

1188
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,269
(Team Ok Geum will win Round 1.)

1189
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,469
(Will she make it?)

1190
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,970
Piano?

1191
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,240
- Okay, Pil Sun.
- It's our turn.

1192
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,309
(Team Pil Sun gets another turn.)

1193
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,850
It's a word that starts with "geo."

1194
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,250
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1195
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:53,556
- It's okay.
- It's understandable.

1196
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,979
- Team Pil Sun!
- A word that begins with "geo."

1197
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,189
- You can say the same word.
- Three.

1198
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,390
- Street.
- Next.

1199
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,560
- Street.
- Please wait. You go.

1200
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,836
(Pil Sun got flustered and thought it was her turn.)

1201
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,660
- You go. Say "mirror."
- Mirror.

1202
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,059
- Three.
- Oh, gosh.

1203
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,780
- Why did you say "mirror?"
- What's wrong?

1204
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,999
- Choose another word.
- Count down again slowly.

1205
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,869
Count down again slowly. You should give her some time.

1206
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,100
- Okay. Just this time.
- You gave them a lot of time.

1207
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,970
(Laughing)

1208
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,009
You're right, ma'am.

1209
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,239
- They got a lot of time earlier.
- You kept giving them more time.

1210
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,509
- We'll start with Pil Sun.
- What word is there?

1211
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,809
- Three, two...
- Did you say it was my turn?

1212
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,479
- Yes.
- Beggar.

1213
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,649
- She said "beggar."
- "Beggar."

1214
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,019
- Beggar.
- Three.

1215
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,380
Geomungo.

1216
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,219
- Geoje Island!
- Merchant.

1217
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,290
He said "merchant."

1218
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,659
- Correct.
- Okay.

1219
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,190
(Team Pil Sun finally got a score!)

1220
00:39:34,615 --> 00:39:36,925
(Let's dance as the other team did.)

1221
00:39:37,385 --> 00:39:39,895
(Their cheery energy has been released.)

1222
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:42,024
- It's okay. They were told...
- When they sit down again...

1223
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:43,695
They were told the answer, so it's okay.

1224
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:46,095
(One person catches the eye.)

1225
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:48,665
That's good.

1226
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:51,634
(Jum Soon, Utgat Village's dancing queen)

1227
00:39:51,635 --> 00:39:52,705
Ma'am.

1228
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,375
(Copying her dance)

1229
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:56,845
(The magical dance move that makes everyone want to copy)

1230
00:39:56,846 --> 00:39:57,905
That's great. Yes.

1231
00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:00,314
That was good. Great job.

1232
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,315
(Their amazing performances received explosive responses.)

1233
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,845
- You're the best.
- You did well.

1234
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:04,015
You're the best, ma'am.

1235
00:40:04,645 --> 00:40:05,984
I think Jum Soon is better at dancing...

1236
00:40:05,985 --> 00:40:07,585
- than DinDin.
- I agree.

1237
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:09,084
She's better than DinDin.

1238
00:40:09,085 --> 00:40:10,784
- The score is tied. It's 1 to 1.
- We made it.

1239
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:12,795
But Jong Min is so bad at this game.

1240
00:40:13,425 --> 00:40:15,794
- Maybe we should start with him.
- But...

1241
00:40:15,795 --> 00:40:18,724
- We'll be stricter from now on.
- Okay.

1242
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:19,934
- Be strict and fair.
- Okay.

1243
00:40:19,935 --> 00:40:22,065
You practically gave the other team one point.

1244
00:40:22,135 --> 00:40:23,405
(Laughing)

1245
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:25,164
(She's so adorable.)

1246
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:27,404
Are you ready? Say the names of fish.

1247
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:28,605
- We got it.
- We got it.

1248
00:40:28,705 --> 00:40:29,774
- Names of fish?
- Team Ok Geum, go.

1249
00:40:29,775 --> 00:40:31,344
- Fish.
- Names of fish.

1250
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,345
- Minnow.
- Mackerel pike.

1251
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,875
- Oh, no. It's not our turn.
- Three.

1252
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:35,715
- Is it not?
- Two.

1253
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:37,614
(Minnow)

1254
00:40:37,615 --> 00:40:38,615
- Like carp.
- It's their turn.

1255
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:40,484
- He said "minnow."
- Three, two...

1256
00:40:40,485 --> 00:40:41,615
Loach.

1257
00:40:41,755 --> 00:40:43,085
- Three.
- Carp.

1258
00:40:43,255 --> 00:40:44,385
Minnow.

1259
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:46,595
(I already said "minnow.")

1260
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:47,724
- He already said it.
- Incorrect.

1261
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:48,755
- We got it.
- We got it.

1262
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:50,365
Hairtail.

1263
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:51,864
Tilefish.

1264
00:40:51,865 --> 00:40:52,994
Mackerel pike.

1265
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:54,935
- Mackerel.
- Pollack.

1266
00:40:55,165 --> 00:40:56,534
(Everyone else including Jum Soon said the right answer smoothly.)

1267
00:40:56,535 --> 00:40:57,805
- Three.
- Goby minnow.

1268
00:40:58,105 --> 00:41:01,734
(Will Team Pil Sun pass?)

1269
00:41:01,735 --> 00:41:02,975
- Three.
- Goby minnow.

1270
00:41:03,145 --> 00:41:05,044
- Goby minnow is a correct answer.
- Is that a name of fish?

1271
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,314
- It's a freshwater fish.
- Correct.

1272
00:41:06,315 --> 00:41:09,814
(Team Pil Sun got the final question right.)

1273
00:41:09,815 --> 00:41:12,685
- Bumble bee, way to go!
- Let's dance.

1274
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:16,255
(The two teams are in very different moods.)

1275
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:18,885
(A drummer boy appears even.)

1276
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,994
- That's good.
- Bumble bee

1277
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:25,565
- That's good. Keep going.
- Bumble bee

1278
00:41:30,065 --> 00:41:31,505
Good job.

1279
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:34,635
They did such a great job.

1280
00:41:35,235 --> 00:41:36,544
They're so good at playing games.

1281
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:38,344
- The ladies did a great job.
- Round One...

1282
00:41:38,345 --> 00:41:40,305
- You are the best.
- I'll announce the result...

1283
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,974
of the 1st round, 6 People, 1 Heart.

1284
00:41:41,975 --> 00:41:43,215
- Is it over?
- Did we lose?

1285
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:45,045
- Team Pil Sun won.
- Yes!

1286
00:41:45,615 --> 00:41:48,285
- We won the first round.
- Oh, yes! It's exciting!

1287
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:50,654
(Team Pil Sun's celebratory dance)

1288
00:41:50,655 --> 00:41:53,225
(What's wrong with my age?)

1289
00:41:55,325 --> 00:41:56,724
(Agen doesn't matter...)

1290
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:59,465
(when it comes to learning.)

1291
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:01,065
That was great!

1292
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:02,334
I'll learn to dance from Jum Soon.

1293
00:42:02,335 --> 00:42:04,381
- How does she dance like that?
- She has a good groove.

1294
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:06,434
(Meanwhile, Tae Hee, who was laughing quietly...)

1295
00:42:06,435 --> 00:42:07,705
That was funny.

1296
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:10,644
- I can't even tell...
- She doesn't even move a lot.

1297
00:42:10,645 --> 00:42:12,244
If this is a dream or reality.

1298
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:16,214
I can't believe I'm having fun with such great people.

1299
00:42:16,215 --> 00:42:18,515
- Are you happy, ma'am?
- Of course, I'm happy.

1300
00:42:19,555 --> 00:42:22,254
Tae Hee said she was so happy.

1301
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:23,924
- Really?
- She just said it.

1302
00:42:23,925 --> 00:42:25,084
Of course, I'm happy.

1303
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:26,924
Nothing like this has happened...

1304
00:42:26,925 --> 00:42:28,754
- in our entire lives, you know.
- You're right.

1305
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,864
I'm almost 90. I feel like I'm in paradise now.

1306
00:42:30,865 --> 00:42:32,465
- This is so nice.
- Tae Hee.

1307
00:42:32,665 --> 00:42:34,934
After we finish the shoot and leave,

1308
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:36,534
please write a poem about us.

1309
00:42:36,535 --> 00:42:38,134
- About meeting us.
- A poem about us.

1310
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:39,274
- Goodness.
- How you felt about meeting us.

1311
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:40,605
- Oh, my.
- Of course.

1312
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:42,545
I'll do that.

1313
00:42:42,675 --> 00:42:46,644
Sure. We'll all write a poem about meeting you guys.

1314
00:42:46,645 --> 00:42:47,714
She said she was very happy.

1315
00:42:47,715 --> 00:42:49,244
- Really?
- Of course, she's happy.

1316
00:42:49,245 --> 00:42:51,344
- She said she was having fun.
- She's sentimental.

1317
00:42:51,345 --> 00:42:52,384
- Indeed.
- Yes.

1318
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:54,185
(She's filled with happiness in this moment.)

1319
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:57,754
(What kind of poem will be created from today's encounter?)

1320
00:42:57,755 --> 00:42:59,595
I'll explain about the second game.

1321
00:42:59,795 --> 00:43:01,425
The game you'll play in this round is...

1322
00:43:01,825 --> 00:43:03,064
a game you all know.

1323
00:43:03,065 --> 00:43:05,325
- It's Scream in Silence.
- This game is difficult.

1324
00:43:05,525 --> 00:43:07,134
- It's a difficult game.
- Everyone on each team...

1325
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,094
wears headphones and relays a keyword...

1326
00:43:09,095 --> 00:43:10,505
in turns.

1327
00:43:11,305 --> 00:43:12,674
(Lose some weight!)

1328
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:13,804
Lose some weight.

1329
00:43:13,805 --> 00:43:14,805
(Pork belly?)

1330
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:15,805
(You fail if this happens.)

1331
00:43:15,806 --> 00:43:17,744
The time limit is three minutes,

1332
00:43:17,745 --> 00:43:20,475
and the team that gets more keywords right wins.

1333
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,715
(Babble of voices)

1334
00:43:25,045 --> 00:43:29,324
(The members explain about the game to the ladies.)

1335
00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:30,684
You should read the lips.

1336
00:43:30,685 --> 00:43:32,224
- Look at the mouth.
- That won't work.

1337
00:43:32,225 --> 00:43:33,724
- I've seen the game on TV.
- Right.

1338
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:35,054
- It's hard to read the lips.
- Right.

1339
00:43:35,055 --> 00:43:36,795
Look carefully at how the mouth moves.

1340
00:43:36,925 --> 00:43:39,695
- For example, "Squirrel."
- That's right.

1341
00:43:39,895 --> 00:43:42,764
From Team Pil Sun, Tae Hee and Jum Soon will play,

1342
00:43:42,765 --> 00:43:46,134
and from Team Ok Geum, Ok Geum and Seon Hwa will play...

1343
00:43:46,135 --> 00:43:48,605
with the cast members on their teams.

1344
00:43:48,975 --> 00:43:50,951
- We'll start with the winning team, - We'll begin...

1345
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:53,515
- which is Team Pil Sun.
- Okay.

1346
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:54,775
I don't hear anything yet.

1347
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:56,944
- We'll play music now.
- Ma'am, it'll be loud.

1348
00:43:56,945 --> 00:43:58,625
- Don't be startled.
- Okay. It's working.

1349
00:43:58,715 --> 00:44:00,655
- You have three minutes.
- We've got this!

1350
00:44:00,885 --> 00:44:02,115
Ready.

1351
00:44:02,955 --> 00:44:04,755
- Get set. Go.
- We should pass the keywords.

1352
00:44:06,095 --> 00:44:07,895
Ma'am, please look at me.

1353
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:09,765
Bibimbap.

1354
00:44:09,795 --> 00:44:10,865
(Nodding)

1355
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:14,265
(Tae Hee turns around as soon as she sees his lips.)

1356
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:16,905
(Seon Ho, who's on the same team, seems more surprised.)

1357
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,005
Bibimbap!

1358
00:44:20,305 --> 00:44:21,835
(What?)

1359
00:44:21,975 --> 00:44:23,204
Bibimbap!

1360
00:44:23,205 --> 00:44:26,274
(Keyword: Bibimbap)

1361
00:44:26,275 --> 00:44:27,815
Bibimbap!

1362
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:29,174
- What?
- What?

1363
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:31,221
(They pass the right word from one to another so easily.)

1364
00:44:31,245 --> 00:44:32,984
(Keyword: Bibimbap)

1365
00:44:32,985 --> 00:44:35,784
- Bibimbap!
- No way. What's going on?

1366
00:44:35,785 --> 00:44:36,924
Okay. I got it.

1367
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:38,161
Perhaps, they can hear each other.

1368

00:50:48,725 --> 00:50:51,425
"Hyeongtaegwi."

1547
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:53,334
She's saying eight syllables.

1548
00:50:53,335 --> 00:50:54,934
- I don't know what he said.
- You don't know?

1549
00:50:54,935 --> 00:50:56,735
- I don't know.
- I don't know either.

1550
00:50:57,605 --> 00:50:58,934
She did some kind of magic.

1551
00:50:58,935 --> 00:51:00,335
(What is that?)

1552
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:03,105
Sand lance.

1553
00:51:03,405 --> 00:51:05,245
"Naahri."

1554
00:51:05,705 --> 00:51:08,744
Sand lance.

1555
00:51:08,745 --> 00:51:10,214
Sand lance.

1556
00:51:10,215 --> 00:51:12,685
- "Naari."
- Hurry up.

1557
00:51:13,215 --> 00:51:15,115
- "Naari."
- Hurry up.

1558
00:51:15,755 --> 00:51:16,854
(I have no idea.)

1559
00:51:16,855 --> 00:51:18,024
(Laughing)

1560
00:51:18,025 --> 00:51:19,155
Just go on.

1561
00:51:19,995 --> 00:51:21,054
- Just go on.
- They won't get it.

1562
00:51:21,055 --> 00:51:24,094
Sand lance.

1563
00:51:24,095 --> 00:51:25,624
- They won't get any correct.
- "Nanari?"

1564
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:26,694
Sand lance.

1565
00:51:26,695 --> 00:51:27,864
(DinDin guessed the word correctly.)

1566
00:51:27,865 --> 00:51:30,404
(Keyword: Sand lance, naari, sand lance)

1567
00:51:30,405 --> 00:51:33,105
- Sand lance.
- What?

1568
00:51:33,705 --> 00:51:35,835
(Seon Hwa guessed the word correctly as well.)

1569
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,844
(They can't possibly guess...)

1570
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:38,874
(this word right.)

1571
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:40,244
- "Sand..."
- "Dog?"

1572
00:51:40,245 --> 00:51:41,645
"Sand..."

1573
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:43,044
- "Sand..."
- "Seagull!"

1574
00:51:43,045 --> 00:51:44,114
- Sand lance.
- Seagull!

1575
00:51:44,115 --> 00:51:46,215
- Sand lance.
- Incorrect.

1576
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:47,354
(Laughing)

1577
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:48,984
They got the wrong word.

1578
00:51:48,985 --> 00:51:51,025
Cobra.

1579
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,425
Cobra.

1580
00:51:54,325 --> 00:51:56,425
- Cobra.
- Correct.

1581
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:58,424
- She's good.
- I know.

1582
00:51:58,425 --> 00:51:59,795
Cobra.

1583
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:03,534
- Cobra.
- Cobra.

1584
00:52:03,535 --> 00:52:05,534
- Right.
- Cobra.

1585
00:52:05,535 --> 00:52:06,535
- Yes.
- I got it.

1586
00:52:06,536 --> 00:52:08,074
(Keyword: Cobra)

1587
00:52:08,075 --> 00:52:09,135
Co...

1588
00:52:10,105 --> 00:52:11,275
Cobra.

1589
00:52:12,345 --> 00:52:13,475
Cobra.

1590
00:52:13,615 --> 00:52:14,845
- Okay.
- Cobra.

1591
00:52:15,115 --> 00:52:17,345
- Cobra.
- Cobra.

1592
00:52:17,815 --> 00:52:19,045
Cobra.

1593
00:52:19,115 --> 00:52:22,014
- Cobra.
- Cob...

1594
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:23,754
- What?
- Cobra.

1595
00:52:23,755 --> 00:52:26,695
(They can have a rematch only if they guess this right.)

1596
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:28,395
(Will he guess this right?)

1597
00:52:28,695 --> 00:52:31,325
- Cobra.
- Co... "Turtle's egg."

1598
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:32,525
"Turtle's egg."

1599
00:52:33,135 --> 00:52:34,265
(Incorrect)

1600
00:52:34,865 --> 00:52:36,565
Se Yoon is the best in this.

1601
00:52:36,605 --> 00:52:38,265
- Incorrect.
- It's over.

1602
00:52:38,665 --> 00:52:39,735
Se Yoon!

1603
00:52:40,305 --> 00:52:42,005
He's no joke.

1604
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:43,805
He's worse than the ladies.

1605
00:52:43,945 --> 00:52:45,104
(Laughing)

1606
00:52:45,105 --> 00:52:46,775
- You're the worst.
- What?

1607
00:52:47,315 --> 00:52:49,274
- What did I do?
- You couldn't get cobra?

1608
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:50,814
- What? It was cobra?
- Cobra.

1609
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,844
Cobra.

1610
00:52:51,845 --> 00:52:53,855
- "Turtle's egg."
- I said, "Cobra."

1611
00:52:54,415 --> 00:52:56,184
What are you doing, Se Yoon?

1612
00:52:56,185 --> 00:52:58,324
- Another question.
- You did an amazing job.

1613
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:00,155
The result of 2 Days Entertainment.

1614
00:53:00,495 --> 00:53:03,865
It's 2 to 0. Team Pil Sun won.

1615
00:53:04,525 --> 00:53:06,025
- Yes.
- Salute!

1616
00:53:06,265 --> 00:53:07,794
Let's just dance.

1617
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:09,834
(Let's dance to celebrate.)

1618
00:53:09,835 --> 00:53:11,034
What a great dancer!

1619
00:53:11,035 --> 00:53:12,304
(Standing up)

1620
00:53:12,305 --> 00:53:13,834
(This is great.)

1621
00:53:13,835 --> 00:53:15,604
(We're becoming one team with the ladies.)

1622
00:53:15,605 --> 00:53:17,375
(Run)

1623
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:22,845
- You're good.
- What a nice dancer.

1624
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:24,685
Nicely done!

1625
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:30,124
(Didn't you have fun with them? Have a glass.)

1626
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,325
This is getting fun.

1627
00:53:31,785 --> 00:53:33,125
- You'll lose again.
- Goodness.

1628
00:53:33,595 --> 00:53:36,524
- The result was 2 to 0, - Yes?

1629
00:53:36,525 --> 00:53:38,624
- but the ladies are having fun.
- Right.

1630
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,494
- So we prepared one more game.
- Okay.

1631
00:53:40,495 --> 00:53:42,635
Do you want to play it for fun?

1632
00:53:42,895 --> 00:53:45,304
Why don't you wrap it up? We can't play another game.

1633
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,675
We'd love to!

1634
00:53:46,835 --> 00:53:48,674
Why don't you play it this time, Jum Soon?

1635
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:51,145
- Play what?
- Sing along when the song plays.

1636
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:53,574
You can face us here.

1637
00:53:53,575 --> 00:53:54,944
- Pil Sun.
- Pil Sun.

1638
00:53:54,945 --> 00:53:55,945

00:53:55,945 --> 00:53:56,945
(Laughing)

1640
00:53:56,946 --> 00:53:58,484
(Queen of Charisma, Park Jum Soon)

1641
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,685
- It'll be so funny.
- Ready.

1642
00:53:59,855 --> 00:54:01,685
Start.

1643
00:54:03,055 --> 00:54:04,684
You have to sing along.

1644
00:54:04,685 --> 00:54:05,724
What does it say?

1645
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:09,194
Dance and KBS

1646
00:54:09,195 --> 00:54:10,595
Dance and KBS?

1647
00:54:11,095 --> 00:54:13,025
KBS.

1648
00:54:13,235 --> 00:54:15,611
- What kind of song is that?
- Meeting... Wait, is that MBC?

1649
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:17,234
APT, APT

1650
00:54:17,235 --> 00:54:19,004
- "APT."
- "APT."

1651
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,705
- Correct.

00:54:23,705 --> 00:54:25,904
(The next song is on.)

1654
00:54:25,905 --> 00:54:30,244
(Singing)

1655
00:54:30,245 --> 00:54:31,345
I don't know.

1656
00:54:31,715 --> 00:54:33,855
- Sing a bit more.
- You're doing great. Keep going.

1657
00:54:34,315 --> 00:54:36,454
(Singing)

1658
00:54:36,455 --> 00:54:38,384

1660
00:54:39,855 --> 00:54:42,225
(Singing)

1661
00:54:43,195 --> 00:54:44,295
"La Song" by Rain.

1662
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:47,664
How about two passes per team?

1663
00:54:47,665 --> 00:54:49,034
Pass.

1664
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,164
(Next question)

1665
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:52,865
(Singing)

1666
00:54:53,375 --> 00:54:55,074
What did she say?

1667
00:54:55,075 --> 00:54:56,605
Yes, with

1668
00:54:56,775 --> 00:54:58,005
- "With?"
- What did she say?

1669
00:54:58,505 --> 00:54:59,844
Enough! Let's stop it now.

1670
00:54:59,845 --> 00:55:00,975
(Laughing)

1671
00:55:01,245 --> 00:55:03,144
- What?
- Come on, ma'am.

1672
00:55:03,145 --> 00:55:04,584
Pass, Jum Soon.

1673
00:55:04,585 --> 00:55:07,514
(It's all up to the ladies today.)

1674
00:55:07,515 --> 00:55:09,215
(The bonus game is over.)

1675
00:55:09,415 --> 00:55:11,724
- We have good news.
- What is it?

1676
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,254
- Since you're all here, - Yes?

1677
00:55:15,255 --> 00:55:17,694
You all can enjoy lunch...

1678
00:55:17,695 --> 00:55:19,665
- so you can all talk together.
- Great!

1679
00:55:20,395 --> 00:55:21,834
- This is nice.
- Great.

1680
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:23,504
We can eat and work then.

1681
00:55:23,505 --> 00:55:25,734
You can let us work hard.

1682
00:55:25,735 --> 00:55:27,905
(We got it.)

1683
00:55:28,235 --> 00:55:30,204
After your meals,

1684
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:33,075
the winners get to take a break.

1685
00:55:33,645 --> 00:55:35,844
- You sleep better at Granny's.
- Sure.

1686
00:55:35,845 --> 00:55:37,915
- You sleep soundly there.
- The loser team...

1687
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:39,915
will go and plant chili seeds.

1688
00:55:39,985 --> 00:55:42,754
First, let's get going for lunch.

1689
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:44,884
- Let's eat now, ladies.
- Sure.

1690
00:55:44,885 --> 00:55:46,054
Please come this way.

1691
00:55:46,055 --> 00:55:48,154
This way, please.

1692
00:55:48,155 --> 00:55:50,394
You can look at the guy with the hat.

1693
00:55:50,395 --> 00:55:52,024
Just say, "2 Days."

1694
00:55:52,025 --> 00:55:54,134
- "2 Days."
- And we'll say, "1 Night."

1695
00:55:54,135 --> 00:55:55,564
- All right.
- We'll give you a sign.

1696
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:57,065
- Let's start.
- Do it upon the sign.

1697
00:55:57,205 --> 00:55:59,304
- Action.
- 2 Days...

1698
00:55:59,305 --> 00:56:02,134
- 1 Night.
- 1 Night.

1699
00:56:02,135 --> 00:56:05,344
- We can go eat now.
- Let's go eat.

1700
00:56:05,345 --> 00:56:07,145
- I'm hungry. Let's eat now.
- Let's go.

1701
00:56:07,415 --> 00:56:09,914
We should have bought something on our way here.

1702
00:56:09,915 --> 00:56:11,714
I know. We came empty-handed.

1703
00:56:11,715 --> 00:56:13,755
- Come on.
- The blue gate is very impressive.

1704
00:56:13,855 --> 00:56:16,514
My blue gate is the best one in town.

1705
00:56:16,515 --> 00:56:18,254
- Isn't this flower beautiful?
- Right.

1706
00:56:18,255 --> 00:56:20,424
- It looks like it's planted.
- It grew out of the gap.

1707
00:56:20,425 --> 00:56:22,354
Like a rose blooming in between buildings.

1708
00:56:22,355 --> 00:56:23,465
Seriously.

1709
00:56:24,325 --> 00:56:26,294
(Ms. Jang preparing for lunch)

1710
00:56:26,295 --> 00:56:28,495
Do you need help? I'm a good chef.

1711
00:56:28,995 --> 00:56:30,364
- What?
- May I take a look at the fridge?

1712
00:56:30,365 --> 00:56:31,965
(Washing her hands first)

1713
00:56:34,335 --> 00:56:37,445
(Making broth for kimchi stew right away)

1714
00:56:37,945 --> 00:56:40,045
Should I make some fried eggs?

1715
00:56:40,645 --> 00:56:42,714
(Being her kitchen assistant)

1716
00:56:42,715 --> 00:56:44,615
- I don't have perilla oil.
- No perilla oil?

1717
00:56:44,785 --> 00:56:46,785
- Eggs...
- No, just use sesame oil.

1718
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:49,755
(Se Yoon is in charge of setting the table.)

1719
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,724
- Should I scoop it when it's done?
- Sure.

1720
00:56:51,725 --> 00:56:53,085
- Wait until it's cooked?
- Yes.

1721
00:56:53,725 --> 00:56:56,454
(Ms. Jang taking out side dishes while making broth)

1722
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:57,925
Green onion kimchi...

1723
00:56:58,265 --> 00:57:00,935
(I must try this one.)

1724
00:57:01,295 --> 00:57:03,265
(Impressed)

1725
00:57:04,235 --> 00:57:05,335
Is it good?

1726
00:57:06,235 --> 00:57:07,835
What kind of salted seafood did you add?

1727
00:57:08,135 --> 00:57:09,305
Just salted seafood.

1728
00:57:09,975 --> 00:57:12,244
You don't have to give us a lot. That's too much for us.

1729
00:57:12,245 --> 00:57:13,245
(Shocked)

1730
00:57:13,246 --> 00:57:14,774
You would enjoy it once you try.

1731
00:57:14,775 --> 00:57:15,945
What is it?

1732
00:57:16,545 --> 00:57:17,715
Wild greens.

1733
00:57:18,085 --> 00:57:19,215
Cotton?

1734
00:57:19,345 --> 00:57:21,655
- Cotton greens?
- No, these are from the front yard.

1735
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:25,224
(Tasting the seasoned greens he has never seen before)

1736
00:57:25,225 --> 00:57:26,424
This is delicious.

1737
00:57:26,425 --> 00:57:28,724
- I can't put little, can I?
- This is good.

1738
00:57:28,725 --> 00:57:30,795
- You can eat a lot, right?
- Sure.

1739
00:57:31,095 --> 00:57:33,224
It would taste so good with rice...

1740
00:57:33,225 --> 00:57:34,434
after having kimchi stew.

1741
00:57:34,435 --> 00:57:35,734
(Table getting filled with precious seasoned vegetables)

1742
00:57:35,735 --> 00:57:37,135
Thank you, Ms. Jang.

1743
00:57:37,665 --> 00:57:39,734
Your side dishes look amazing.

1744
00:57:39,735 --> 00:57:41,175
We just need rice now.

1745
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:42,904
I don't think there's more to do. What should I do?

1746
00:57:42,905 --> 00:57:44,305
You don't have anything more to do.

1747
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,304
We just need to cook this. That's it.

1748
00:57:46,305 --> 00:57:47,314
(Putting one whole pack of pork)

1749
00:57:47,315 --> 00:57:48,975
You just add the whole thing?

1750
00:57:50,145 --> 00:57:52,545
(For her grandchildren who love meat)

1751
00:57:52,915 --> 00:57:54,455
(Adding another handful of pork)

1752
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,414
The stew looks fantastic now.

1753
00:57:56,415 --> 00:57:57,755
(Kimchi stew full of pork)

1754
00:57:58,685 --> 00:57:59,724
(Adding a lot of minced garlic)

1755
00:57:59,725 --> 00:58:00,825
Great.

1756
00:58:01,095 --> 00:58:02,555
She's adding a lot of garlic.

1757
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:05,264
It looks amazing.

1758
00:58:05,265 --> 00:58:08,835
(Adding lots of green onions just like the generous lady)

1759
00:58:09,395 --> 00:58:13,505
(Adding a generous amount of tofu)

1760
00:58:15,175 --> 00:58:16,975
We just need to scoop the rice.

1761
00:58:17,645 --> 00:58:18,844
Should we mix it with rice later?

1762
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:19,904
(While Team Ok Geum is smoothly preparing for lunch)

1763
00:58:19,905 --> 00:58:22,115
- I'll just mix it right now.
- Right now?

1764
00:58:22,315 --> 00:58:23,514
- Hey.
- Yes?

1765
00:58:23,515 --> 00:58:24,684
Let's just set the table and eat.

1766
00:58:24,685 --> 00:58:26,525
You should take a seat. Let us do the cooking.

1767
00:58:26,885 --> 00:58:29,014
- You can take a seat.
- Let me help you with the bowls.

1768
00:58:29,015 --> 00:58:30,885
- Please take a seat.
- No.

1769
00:58:31,325 --> 00:58:33,084
- Get this.
- This one?

1770
00:58:33,085 --> 00:58:34,454
I can't take it out because it's heavy.

1771
00:58:34,455 --> 00:58:35,724
(Seon Ho taking out the kimchi container instead of the lady)

1772
00:58:35,725 --> 00:58:38,025
Put it over here. I'll take out the aged kimchi.

1773
00:58:38,665 --> 00:58:39,925
Is your aged kimchi good?

1774
00:58:39,995 --> 00:58:41,165
(Sniffing)

1775
00:58:41,295 --> 00:58:43,134
This kimchi smells incredible.

1776
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:44,364
(You can tell the kimchi is good just from the smell.)

1777
00:58:44,365 --> 00:58:46,764
It tastes better because she cooked it herself.

1778
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:47,904
(Homemade food is good.)

1779
00:58:47,905 --> 00:58:49,504
(A head of cabbage)

1780
00:58:49,505 --> 00:58:51,645
(Two heads of cabbage for her grandchildren)

1781
00:58:52,745 --> 00:58:55,515
The kimchi is amazing. The aged kimchi is awesome.

1782
00:58:55,675 --> 00:58:57,015
Look at this.

1783
00:58:57,545 --> 00:58:58,784
Should I make kimchi fried rice?

1784
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,705
- That would be delicious.
- That would be good.

1785
00:59:01,315 --> 00:59:03,885
(Sae Ho is the main chef in this team.)

1786
00:59:04,185 --> 00:59:06,055
It smells amazing.

1787
00:59:06,155 --> 00:59:07,924
The kimchi is delicious, so...

1788
00:59:07,925 --> 00:59:09,154
It's a masterpiece.

1789
00:59:09,155 --> 00:59:10,524
Your kimchi smells amazing.

1790
00:59:10,525 --> 00:59:11,824
- What?
- The kimchi is great.

1791
00:59:11,825 --> 00:59:13,635
I wouldn't know.

1792
00:59:14,365 --> 00:59:16,034
The eggs are great.

1793
00:59:16,035 --> 00:59:17,035
Of course.

1794
00:59:17,735 --> 00:59:19,565
It would be amazing with the eggs.

1795
00:59:20,835 --> 00:59:22,275
The rice looks good.

1796
00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:24,404
- Grandma.
- Yes?

1797
00:59:24,405 --> 00:59:25,874
You made the anchovy broth...

1798
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:27,214
- to make doenjang jjigae.
- Yes.

1799
00:59:27,215 --> 00:59:28,745
Could you make doenjang jjigae for us?

1800
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,344
Should I make doenjang jjigae?

1801
00:59:30,345 --> 00:59:31,614
- Yes.
- Please make the jjigae for us.

1802
00:59:31,615 --> 00:59:32,644
- Then...
- That would be great.

1803
00:59:32,645 --> 00:59:34,514
- Since it's been a while...
- I'll go and get some doenjang.

1804
00:59:34,515 --> 00:59:37,054
Grandma's doenjang jjigae. How delicious would that be?

1805
00:59:37,055 --> 00:59:38,424
Grandma's doenjang jjigae.

1806
00:59:38,425 --> 00:59:40,694
Did you make all these?

1807
00:59:40,695 --> 00:59:42,355
- That's right.
- Goodness.

1808
00:59:43,055 --> 00:59:44,894
(He opens the crock.)

1809
00:59:44,895 --> 00:59:46,224
It's meju. You made meju.

1810
00:59:46,225 --> 00:59:48,764
I made meju at home.

1811
00:59:48,765 --> 00:59:50,204
I stepped on them and hung them.

1812
00:59:50,205 --> 00:59:52,234
My legs hurt,

1813
00:59:52,235 --> 00:59:53,464
so when I stepped on them,

1814
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:55,334
I didn't step on them so hard.

1815
00:59:55,335 --> 00:59:57,305
- You didn't have the strength.
- Yes.

1816
00:59:57,545 --> 00:59:58,704
There are a lot of beans.

1817
00:59:58,705 --> 01:00:00,174
Right. There's a lot.

1818
01:00:00,175 --> 01:00:01,375
There are a lot of beans.

1819
01:00:01,575 --> 01:00:02,845
It looks so good.

1820
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:05,484
I don't know if it would be good.

1821
01:00:05,485 --> 01:00:07,184
I think it would be tasty even if I ate it just like this.

1822
01:00:07,185 --> 01:00:08,715
It should be cooked.

1823
01:00:09,615 --> 01:00:11,584
- A bit bigger.
- A bit bigger?

1824
01:00:11,585 --> 01:00:12,585
(Will Jong Min make the doenjang jjigae?)

1825
01:00:12,586 --> 01:00:13,954
We'll make it here.

1826
01:00:13,955 --> 01:00:15,055
How is it?

1827
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:16,524
It's amazing, of course.

1828
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:18,665
- I put in the green onions.
- Put the green onions.

1829
01:00:18,725 --> 01:00:19,795
Organic green onions.

1830
01:00:19,895 --> 01:00:21,964
- There's nothing more to put.
- There's nothing more to put.

1831
01:00:21,965 --> 01:00:24,234
It would be nicer if you put lots of other things.

1832
01:00:24,235 --> 01:00:25,304
I only have the green onions.

1833
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:27,404
The broth itself tastes good...

1834
01:00:27,405 --> 01:00:28,905
because the doenjang tastes good.

1835
01:00:29,135 --> 01:00:30,645
I don't know if it would be good.

1836
01:00:31,145 --> 01:00:32,405
Should we try the broth?

1837
01:00:32,505 --> 01:00:34,544
You should put many things, but that's the only thing I have.

1838
01:00:34,545 --> 01:00:35,714
I only have the green onions.

1839
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,584
(They're curious.)

1840
01:00:37,585 --> 01:00:39,545
- It's good.
- Is it good?

1841
01:00:39,615 --> 01:00:40,785
It's good.

1842
01:00:41,315 --> 01:00:43,014
The doenjang jjigae looks great.

1843
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:44,201
(The doenjang jjigae tastes great.)

1844
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:46,754
It's nice that you're cooking.

1845
01:00:46,755 --> 01:00:49,155
I don't need to be watching. It's convenient.

1846
01:00:49,295 --> 01:00:50,995
There are many grandsons here.

1847
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:52,524
Goodness.

1848
01:00:52,525 --> 01:00:53,564
Have a seat.

1849
01:00:53,565 --> 01:00:55,935
- It's amazing.
- Thank you for the food.

1850
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:57,964
It looks so good.

1851
01:00:57,965 --> 01:00:59,534
- Who has ketchup?
- Ketchup.

1852
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:00,805
Here you go.

1853
01:01:00,975 --> 01:01:02,135
There's so much.

1854
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:03,505
Ma'am.

1855
01:01:04,545 --> 01:01:05,805
I'll get some jjigae for you.

1856
01:01:06,445 --> 01:01:09,245
(There's a whole kimchi leaf.)

1857
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,414
It became like this because I put in long strips.

1858
01:01:11,415 --> 01:01:12,984
(She cuts it with her hand when it's still hot.)

1859
01:01:12,985 --> 01:01:14,015
Here you go.

1860
01:01:14,085 --> 01:01:15,114
(Tearing)

1861
01:01:15,115 --> 01:01:17,185
It's hot. Here.

1862
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:18,484
(Swallowing)

1863
01:01:18,485 --> 01:01:20,894
This is so nice. The whole kimchi.

1864
01:01:20,895 --> 01:01:22,455
(It's time to taste the kimchi jjigae.)

1865
01:01:22,695 --> 01:01:24,424
(Eat a lot, Se Yoon.)

1866
01:01:24,425 --> 01:01:25,625
Eat up, everyone.

1867
01:01:26,165 --> 01:01:28,564
The elder should eat first.

1868
01:01:28,565 --> 01:01:30,464
Let's clink our glasses.

1869
01:01:30,465 --> 01:01:32,435
Thank you for the food.

1870
01:01:32,465 --> 01:01:33,734
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

1871
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:35,235
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1872
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:36,504
It's been a while since I last drank barley tea.

1873
01:01:36,505 --> 01:01:38,545
(They drink the barley tea first.)

1874
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:42,315
(Tasting the jjigae)

1875
01:01:42,415 --> 01:01:44,745
It's neat. It's perfect.

1876
01:01:46,085 --> 01:01:47,585
It's fine.

1877
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:48,955
(Exclaiming)

1878
01:01:50,655 --> 01:01:51,725
(Slurping)

1879
01:01:52,455 --> 01:01:54,324
(The deep and strong taste of Grandma's kimchi jjigae)

1880
01:01:54,325 --> 01:01:55,424
- It's good.
- It's neat.

1881
01:01:55,425 --> 01:01:57,364
- It's amazing.
- Hey.

1882
01:01:57,365 --> 01:01:58,564
Look at this.

1883
01:01:58,565 --> 01:01:59,694
Is that all you need?

1884
01:01:59,695 --> 01:02:01,035
The smell of the sesame oil.

1885
01:02:01,395 --> 01:02:02,534
This is kimchi jjigae.

1886
01:02:02,535 --> 01:02:04,565
This was grown in my garden.

1887
01:02:04,735 --> 01:02:06,565
- Did you get this from your garden?
- Yes.

1888
01:02:06,805 --> 01:02:08,104
It's from my garden.

1889
01:02:08,105 --> 01:02:09,804
(She grew the wild vegetables.)

1890
01:02:09,805 --> 01:02:11,275
It's different.

1891
01:02:11,945 --> 01:02:13,204
It has a good smell.

1892
01:02:13,205 --> 01:02:14,444
- It must smell different.
- Wild vegetables?

1893
01:02:14,445 --> 01:02:15,845
It smells really good. Try it.

1894
01:02:16,075 --> 01:02:17,614
(He eats with his nose and his mouth.)

1895
01:02:17,615 --> 01:02:18,745
Goodness.

1896
01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:23,014
It's amazing.

1897
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:24,454
(DinDin mixes the wild vegetables with the rice.)

1898
01:02:24,455 --> 01:02:25,975
The wild vegetables taste really good.

1899
01:02:26,155 --> 01:02:28,694
You don't get this at restaurants.

1900
01:02:28,695 --> 01:02:30,525
(This is the taste made by Grandma.)

1901
01:02:30,765 --> 01:02:34,395
But why do you have the ice cream in the freezer?

1902
01:02:34,535 --> 01:02:36,965
Elders like ice cream.

1903
01:02:37,305 --> 01:02:38,765
Can we have ice cream too?

1904
01:02:39,535 --> 01:02:40,605
(Nodding)

1905
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:41,704
You can have it.

1906
01:02:41,705 --> 01:02:43,435
I don't think I should.

1907
01:02:44,445 --> 01:02:46,774
Go and buy some. We should think of filling it in.

1908
01:02:46,775 --> 01:02:48,444
That's right. I should have thought of that.

1909
01:02:48,445 --> 01:02:50,244
Could we eat it now and fill it in tomorrow?

1910
01:02:50,245 --> 01:02:51,515
Why not?

1911
01:02:51,585 --> 01:02:52,585
Why not?

1912
01:02:52,586 --> 01:02:53,685
Go and bring the ice cream.

1913
01:02:53,855 --> 01:02:56,354
- I'll bring the ice cream.
- Okay.

1914
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,654
- Sure.
- She told us to eat it.

1915
01:02:57,655 --> 01:02:59,084
- Will you really eat it?
- We should have it.

1916
01:02:59,085 --> 01:03:00,284
- We should.
- She told us we could eat.

1917
01:03:00,285 --> 01:03:02,295
We can have ice cream at Grandma's house.

1918
01:03:02,595 --> 01:03:04,195
Can we eat ice cream?

1919
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:06,695
- I already told you.
- Right.

1920
01:03:06,795 --> 01:03:07,994
Which one would you like to have?

1921
01:03:07,995 --> 01:03:09,064
(Elders first.)

1922
01:03:09,065 --> 01:03:10,364
Since it's hers,

1923
01:03:10,365 --> 01:03:12,004
play rock-paper-scissors to decide one person to eat.

1924
01:03:12,005 --> 01:03:14,305
Why? She's our grandma.

1925
01:03:14,435 --> 01:03:16,374
- She said we could have it.
- Who are you?

1926
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,704
- Who are you?
- We are her grandsons.

1927
01:03:17,705 --> 01:03:19,644
Why are you telling them not to eat when I told them to eat?

1928
01:03:19,645 --> 01:03:21,615
That's right.

1929
01:03:22,175 --> 01:03:23,814
- Tell them to go out.
- You shouldn't scold them.

1930
01:03:23,815 --> 01:03:24,985
Tell them to go out.

1931
01:03:25,045 --> 01:03:26,285
"Get out of my house!"

1932
01:03:26,445 --> 01:03:28,685
- "Don't scold my grandchildren!"
- Would you like some?

1933
01:03:29,415 --> 01:03:30,525
(Laughing)

1934
01:03:32,985 --> 01:03:34,494
I feel bad since we're eating this without you.

1935
01:03:34,495 --> 01:03:36,024
- Goodness.
- It's okay.

1936
01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:38,065
It's so funny.

1937
01:03:38,595 --> 01:03:41,534
We'll send you these in boxes tomorrow.

1938
01:03:41,535 --> 01:03:43,395
You don't have to do that.

1939
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:45,205
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1940
01:03:48,305 --> 01:03:49,834
Isn't this the first time like this?

1941
01:03:49,835 --> 01:03:52,474
- We're here on a holiday.
- This is what you do

1942
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:53,674
in the month of family.

1943
01:03:53,675 --> 01:03:54,715
Grandma.

1944
01:03:55,015 --> 01:03:57,115
Couldn't we go to the chili pepper field tomorrow?

1945
01:03:57,285 --> 01:03:59,014
(Being stubborn again)

1946
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:01,285
We can't say that...

1947
01:04:01,615 --> 01:04:03,315
because we lost.

1948
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:06,955
Whose fault was it that we lost?

1949
01:04:07,225 --> 01:04:09,025
Don't say that.

1950
01:04:09,295 --> 01:04:11,964
Who knows why we lost?

1951
01:04:11,965 --> 01:04:14,335
All that matters is that we had fun.

1952
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,934
- You should learn.
- I had to make English sounds.

1953
01:04:17,935 --> 01:04:20,504
I had to make English sounds.

1954
01:04:20,505 --> 01:04:23,234
(She played Scream in Silence for the first time.)

1955
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:26,874
I couldn't say anything,

1956
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:29,075
so I just did it like this.

1957
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,845
(As long as we had fun, it's all good.)

1958
01:04:32,015 --> 01:04:34,614
Are you perhaps thinking...

1959
01:04:34,615 --> 01:04:36,215
Jong Min should have come here?

1960
01:04:37,855 --> 01:04:39,384
- You did.
- You did.

1961
01:04:39,385 --> 01:04:41,255
- You did.
- She did.

1962
01:04:41,955 --> 01:04:43,194
(She paused for too long to say she didn't.)

1963
01:04:43,195 --> 01:04:44,394
You're making us sad.

1964
01:04:44,395 --> 01:04:45,825
- You did.
- I didn't.

1965
01:04:45,895 --> 01:04:47,734
But later on, we'll play a game...

1966
01:04:47,735 --> 01:04:50,465
where you can switch the grandsons to your liking.

1967
01:04:50,505 --> 01:04:52,265
That means Jong Min could come.

1968
01:04:52,965 --> 01:04:54,535
It's okay.

1969
01:04:55,175 --> 01:04:58,105
(They're touched.)

1970
01:04:58,345 --> 01:04:59,605
I don't need to change.

1971
01:04:59,675 --> 01:05:00,875
You're...

1972
01:05:01,175 --> 01:05:03,914
my members today.

1973
01:05:03,915 --> 01:05:05,785
(My grandsons are my members.)

1974
01:05:05,915 --> 01:05:07,084
- Right?
- This feels reassuring.

1975
01:05:07,085 --> 01:05:08,314
She's loyal.

1976
01:05:08,315 --> 01:05:10,484
We're like a family after eating a meal.

1977
01:05:10,485 --> 01:05:12,285
- Right?
- Right.

1978
01:05:12,355 --> 01:05:13,355
- Right?
- Right.

1979
01:05:13,356 --> 01:05:15,725
Did you see that? Our grandma is the best.

1980
01:05:15,755 --> 01:05:17,495
You become a family...

1981
01:05:18,425 --> 01:05:19,825
even if you spend one day together.

1982
01:05:20,935 --> 01:05:22,864
- This is very touching.
- I'm learning so many things.

1983
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:25,305
- It's really touching.
- We're a family and members.

1984
01:05:26,035 --> 01:05:27,574
I feel emotional.

1985
01:05:27,575 --> 01:05:29,105
Why is this touching?

1986
01:05:29,335 --> 01:05:30,335
Are you done, Sae Ho?

1987
01:05:30,336 --> 01:05:31,374
(Meanwhile, Grandma Pil Sun and the three grandsons)

1988
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:33,405
- Did it boil?
- Yes.

1989
01:05:34,215 --> 01:05:35,544
(Grandma Pil Sun's doenjang jjigae is ready.)

1990
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:38,514
- This is really grandma's...
- Smell that.

1991
01:05:38,515 --> 01:05:39,784
- The color is clear.
- Right.

1992
01:05:39,785 --> 01:05:41,754
She put in so much doenjang.

1993
01:05:41,755 --> 01:05:42,755
Look at the beans. It looks great.

1994
01:05:42,756 --> 01:05:44,316
- Did she get it from the crock?
- Yes.

1995
01:05:44,355 --> 01:05:45,985
There are so many side dishes.

1996
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:48,224
- It's so nice.
- Yes.

1997
01:05:48,225 --> 01:05:49,424
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy.

1998
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:50,624
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1999
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:52,164
There's nothing to eat.

2000
01:05:52,165 --> 01:05:53,394
There's a lot.

2001
01:05:53,395 --> 01:05:54,995
- We can't eat so much.
- Enjoy.

2002
01:05:55,095 --> 01:05:57,034
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

2003
01:05:57,035 --> 01:05:58,565
- Yes.
- Enjoy your meal.

2004
01:05:59,365 --> 01:06:01,204
(He tries the grandma's doenjang jjigae.)

2005
01:06:01,205 --> 01:06:02,235
This is nice.

2006
01:06:03,235 --> 01:06:04,804
- This is nice.
- Yes?

2007
01:06:04,805 --> 01:06:06,975
It should have had zucchini and chili pepper.

2008
01:06:07,045 --> 01:06:09,174
We should have put in zucchinis...

2009
01:06:09,175 --> 01:06:11,345
- and chili pepper.
- Right, but it's seasoned well.

2010
01:06:11,545 --> 01:06:13,954
Come back in summer when they grow. I'll cook for you again.

2011
01:06:13,955 --> 01:06:15,185
We'd love that.

2012
01:06:15,385 --> 01:06:18,255
Right. It's organic.

2013
01:06:18,355 --> 01:06:21,155
(He eats the kimchi fried rice made with Grandma's aged kimchi.)

2014
01:06:21,455 --> 01:06:23,424
The kimchi fried rice.

2015
01:06:23,425 --> 01:06:24,895
(How does it taste like this?)

2016
01:06:26,895 --> 01:06:28,634
The kimchi fried rice.

2017
01:06:28,635 --> 01:06:29,635
It's good.

2018
01:06:30,465 --> 01:06:31,765
I eat at the village hall.

2019
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:34,605
- The kimchi tastes amazing.
- I eat at the village hall.

2020
01:06:34,735 --> 01:06:37,275
The kimchi tastes so good.

2021
01:06:37,405 --> 01:06:39,204
- Is it good?
- Since the kimchi tastes good,

2022
01:06:39,205 --> 01:06:40,374
it doesn't need anything else.

2023
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,375
(The simple kimchi fried rice tastes good...)

2024
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:42,414
(because the kimchi tastes good.)

2025
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,255
The kimchi tastes so good. It's so refreshing.

2026
01:06:45,015 --> 01:06:46,584
Kimchi always tastes good.

2027
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:47,615
(Feeling proud)

2028
01:06:47,685 --> 01:06:49,884
Do you always eat alone?

2029
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:51,324
- I always eat alone.
- Every day?

2030
01:06:51,325 --> 01:06:54,594
Sometimes I eat, sometimes I don't.

2031
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:55,954
You eat whenever you want.

2032
01:06:55,955 --> 01:06:57,694
Isn't it nice to eat together?

2033
01:06:57,695 --> 01:06:59,795
Of course, it's nice. I can eat easily.

2034
01:07:00,895 --> 01:07:02,094
(She eats the fried eggs that Sae Ho made.)

2035
01:07:02,095 --> 01:07:04,564
I think I'm eating three bowls of the kimchi fried rice.

2036
01:07:04,565 --> 01:07:05,565
Really?

2037
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,134
- Eat more.
- Eat more.

2038
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,811
(She tries the doenjang jjigae that Jong Min made.)

2039
01:07:08,835 --> 01:07:10,505
- You should eat a lot.
- Okay.

2040
01:07:10,705 --> 01:07:12,005
You should all eat a lot.

2041
01:07:12,305 --> 01:07:15,374
Try it with this and the wild vegetables.

2042
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:16,815
- Spinach.
- Spinach.

2043
01:07:17,315 --> 01:07:21,385
(She's eating with three grandsons today.)

2044
01:07:21,685 --> 01:07:24,125
Have you seen such tables before?

2045
01:07:24,255 --> 01:07:26,425
- At my grandma's.
- At your grandma's?

2046
01:07:26,455 --> 01:07:27,724
You had this since you were young, right?

2047
01:07:27,725 --> 01:07:28,755
This is an old table.

2048
01:07:28,855 --> 01:07:30,155
Since you were young.

2049
01:07:30,225 --> 01:07:33,725
How old were you when you got married?

2050
01:07:34,035 --> 01:07:35,264
I got married at a young age.

2051
01:07:35,265 --> 01:07:36,694
- How old were you?
- Twenty.

2052
01:07:36,695 --> 01:07:39,164
(The old groom is shocked.)

2053
01:07:39,165 --> 01:07:40,165
When you were 20?

2054
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:42,434
When she was four years younger than me.

2055
01:07:42,435 --> 01:07:45,304
Did you have an arranged meeting with your husband?

2056
01:07:45,305 --> 01:07:46,975
How did you meet him?

2057
01:07:47,005 --> 01:07:49,274
Everyone's marriage was arranged back in the day.

2058
01:07:49,275 --> 01:07:50,445
Arranged marriage.

2059
01:07:50,475 --> 01:07:51,684
I didn't even know what he looked like.

2060
01:07:51,685 --> 01:07:52,685
You didn't even know his face.

2061
01:07:52,686 --> 01:07:53,885
Really?

2062
01:07:54,185 --> 01:07:55,314
- Then...
- Did you see his face...

2063
01:07:55,315 --> 01:07:56,384
for the first time when you got married?

2064
01:07:56,385 --> 01:07:58,385
- Yes. It was my first time.
- On the wedding day.

2065
01:07:59,685 --> 01:08:02,024
Was it always like that before?

2066
01:08:02,025 --> 01:08:03,054
- Yes.
- You don't know the faces?

2067
01:08:03,055 --> 01:08:04,094
- Right.
- Many people did that.

2068
01:08:04,095 --> 01:08:06,175
Then we met in one house and had a family gathering.

2069
01:08:06,365 --> 01:08:07,535
That's how? Goodness.

2070
01:08:08,095 --> 01:08:10,664
If you went back in time,

2071
01:08:10,665 --> 01:08:12,605
would you meet him again?

2072
01:08:13,105 --> 01:08:14,305
If you were to marry again.

2073
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:16,555
I don't know. I'd have to see after I die.

2074
01:08:19,005 --> 01:08:21,145
Why would I marry him?

2075
01:08:21,175 --> 01:08:23,314
After we're done eating,

2076
01:08:23,315 --> 01:08:25,085
we have to do the dishes.

2077
01:08:25,145 --> 01:08:27,554
Do you want Webfoot Octopus, Garlic,

2078
01:08:27,555 --> 01:08:28,754
or Cabbage to do it?

2079
01:08:28,755 --> 01:08:30,054
- I don't know.
- You can just choose.

2080
01:08:30,055 --> 01:08:32,484
- How could I make anyone do it?
- Just for fun.

2081
01:08:32,485 --> 01:08:33,625
Choose anyone.

2082
01:08:33,925 --> 01:08:35,855
- The youngest should do it.
- Me?

2083
01:08:36,855 --> 01:08:38,865
- The youngest one.
- The youngest will do it.

2084
01:08:38,965 --> 01:08:41,265
- This is funny.
- The youngest should do it.

2085
01:08:42,095 --> 01:08:45,435
(Team Ok Geum is also deciding who will do the dishes.)

2086
01:08:45,565 --> 01:08:47,574
We should do the dishes now.

2087
01:08:47,575 --> 01:08:49,634
Who will be doing it?

2088
01:08:49,635 --> 01:08:52,204
Anyone is fine.

2089
01:08:52,205 --> 01:08:53,974
Choose one person.

2090
01:08:53,975 --> 01:08:55,574
Choose one person.

2091
01:08:55,575 --> 01:08:57,415
Point at that person.

2092
01:08:57,445 --> 01:08:58,744
(Who will Ok Geum choose?)

2093
01:08:58,745 --> 01:08:59,915
(DinDin)

2094
01:09:00,545 --> 01:09:03,415
- Okay!
- Who are you pointing at?

2095
01:09:04,255 --> 01:09:06,885
(We were on good terms.)

2096
01:09:08,025 --> 01:09:10,525
- Nice!
- Gosh.

2097
01:09:10,655 --> 01:09:12,294
I cooked the eggs too.

2098
01:09:12,295 --> 01:09:14,024
- Why must I wash the dishes?
- You can step away.

2099
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,364
He will do everything.

2100
01:09:15,365 --> 01:09:17,641
(The youngest will wash the dishes for Team Ok Geum as well.)

2101
01:09:17,665 --> 01:09:22,175
(The eldest members of each team volunteer to help out.)

2102
01:09:23,335 --> 01:09:24,405
Ma'am.

2103
01:09:24,775 --> 01:09:25,805
Yes?

2104
01:09:26,305 --> 01:09:27,514
I bought some things.

2105
01:09:27,515 --> 01:09:29,715
What did you buy? I told you not to!

2106
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:31,485
My goodness.

2107
01:09:31,615 --> 01:09:33,215
- Take a look.
- What did you buy?

2108
01:09:33,885 --> 01:09:36,255
(While the older members were cleaning up, )

2109
01:09:38,655 --> 01:09:41,725
(he checked the missing ingredients...)

2110
01:09:42,195 --> 01:09:44,525
(including the ones kept at room temperature.)

2111
01:09:44,865 --> 01:09:46,125
I'll get the premium one.

2112
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:49,934
I'll get the exact one she uses.

2113
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:52,035
(Seon Ho went grocery shopping.)

2114
01:09:52,435 --> 01:09:54,935
I told you not to buy things! Why did you go?

2115
01:09:55,505 --> 01:09:56,575
I knew it.

2116
01:09:57,075 --> 01:09:59,275
I bought the best quality eggs.

2117
01:10:00,145 --> 01:10:02,115
- Eggs are good for you.
- Right.

2118
01:10:02,475 --> 01:10:03,715
Eggs are good for you.

2119
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:05,114
I'll rest in the room.

2120
01:10:05,115 --> 01:10:06,984
- I'll be off then.
- Okay.

2121
01:10:06,985 --> 01:10:08,505
- I'm off to the village hall.
- Okay.

2122
01:10:08,885 --> 01:10:10,454
Stop the thief if one happens to come in.

2123
01:10:10,455 --> 01:10:11,585
I'll bring the thief down.

2124
01:10:14,455 --> 01:10:17,095
It wasn't the small garden in front of the house.

2125
01:10:17,525 --> 01:10:18,825
I didn't see it.

2126
01:10:19,025 --> 01:10:20,694
It wasn't the small garden in front of the house.

2127
01:10:20,695 --> 01:10:21,735
It's this one.

2128
01:10:22,035 --> 01:10:24,265
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am!

2129
01:10:24,305 --> 01:10:25,965
- Why are you working already?
- Gosh.

2130
01:10:26,465 --> 01:10:27,534
Ma'am.

2131
01:10:27,535 --> 01:10:29,334
- Hello. We meet again.
- You should come out.

2132
01:10:29,335 --> 01:10:30,615
You'll hurt your back. Come out.

2133
01:10:30,775 --> 01:10:32,375
Come out. We'll do it.

2134
01:10:32,505 --> 01:10:34,175
Just tell us how it must be done.

2135
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:36,874
One person should dig out the soil.

2136
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:37,914
Make a hole.

2137
01:10:37,915 --> 01:10:39,461
The next person should get the seedling.

2138
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,245
The chili pepper seedling should be planted.

2139
01:10:42,015 --> 01:10:43,214
The next person should water it.

2140
01:10:43,215 --> 01:10:45,624
This is how the three of you can work...

2141
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:47,895
- just by taking each role.
- Right.

2142
01:10:48,325 --> 01:10:49,554
Take a look.

2143
01:10:49,555 --> 01:10:52,325
- Dig it up like this.
- That's right.

2144
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:54,834
I've learned a lot...

2145
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:56,065
at my mom's garden.

2146
01:10:56,865 --> 01:10:58,705
You should plant it now.

2147
01:10:58,835 --> 01:10:59,865
Follow along.

2148
01:11:01,575 --> 01:11:03,975
(It's done after DinDin waters it.)

2149
01:11:04,075 --> 01:11:06,045
This must be a lot of work to do alone.

2150
01:11:06,805 --> 01:11:08,945
The plastic here is done...

2151
01:11:09,775 --> 01:11:12,015
- by the young men here, right?
- I do it on my own.

2152
01:11:12,115 --> 01:11:13,484
- You do it on your own?
- Of course.

2153
01:11:13,485 --> 01:11:15,854
- You did all of this alone?
- I must do everything alone.

2154
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,954
- Really?
- There's no one to help.

2155
01:11:17,955 --> 01:11:19,784
Gosh, how is this done alone?

2156
01:11:19,785 --> 01:11:22,425
You should get some rest. We'll do all the work.

2157
01:11:22,595 --> 01:11:23,624
I have to be somewhere.

2158
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:24,995
- Don't worry.
- Right.

2159
01:11:25,095 --> 01:11:26,664
- Don't worry about us.
- Don't worry about us.

2160
01:11:26,665 --> 01:11:27,665
Okay.

2161
01:11:27,666 --> 01:11:29,295
- You can go now.
- Okay.

2162
01:11:30,135 --> 01:11:31,835
Gosh, she does this all on her own?

2163
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:36,935
(We should work harder.)

2164
01:11:38,575 --> 01:11:40,174
(Planting the seedling after filling in the soil)

2165
01:11:40,175 --> 01:11:42,255
(Joon does the hardest task without any complaints.)

2166
01:11:44,815 --> 01:11:46,295
Should we switch? Should I do it now?

2167
01:11:46,485 --> 01:11:47,485
- I'm fine.
- It's tough, isn't it?

2168
01:11:47,486 --> 01:11:48,554
No.

2169
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:50,555
It feels like I'm at my grandmother's house.

2170
01:11:51,455 --> 01:11:55,555
(DinDin was usually full of complaints, )

2171
01:11:56,495 --> 01:11:57,824
(but today, he keeps his back bent...)

2172
01:11:57,825 --> 01:12:00,824
(and works hard to water the seedlings.)

2173
01:12:00,825 --> 01:12:02,505
Give the seedlings a lot of water, DinDin.

2174
01:12:02,565 --> 01:12:04,034
Based on how much water you give,

2175
01:12:04,035 --> 01:12:05,935
the seedlings will either become you or me.

2176
01:12:05,965 --> 01:12:07,285
Aren't both options bad for them?

2177
01:12:07,905 --> 01:12:09,734
This isn't a difficult task,

2178
01:12:09,735 --> 01:12:12,404
- but it really hurts your back.
- Right.

2179
01:12:12,405 --> 01:12:14,715
(The three do their best...)

2180
01:12:15,445 --> 01:12:17,845
(to make her work easier when she returns.)

2181
01:12:18,715 --> 01:12:19,814
Gosh!

2182
01:12:19,815 --> 01:12:22,384
- You guys are going through a lot.
- You guys are going through a lot.

2183
01:12:22,385 --> 01:12:23,754
- We brought a snack.
- What is that?

2184
01:12:23,755 --> 01:12:25,224
- A snack.
- We brought a snack.

2185
01:12:25,225 --> 01:12:27,155
- What is that?
- We brought a snack.

2186
01:12:27,285 --> 01:12:28,555
What? This is all you did?

2187
01:12:28,695 --> 01:12:30,976
Gosh, that's nice of you to say right after getting here.

2188
01:12:31,065 --> 01:12:32,965
End it there and have some of this.

2189
01:12:33,095 --> 01:12:34,794
- What did you bring?
- This?

2190
01:12:34,795 --> 01:12:36,164
It's something amazing.

2191
01:12:36,165 --> 01:12:38,535
- It will definitely energize you.
- Right.

2192
01:12:38,665 --> 01:12:40,835
- What is that? That's great.
- Gosh.

2193
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:43,034
But will all six of us eat?

2194
01:12:43,035 --> 01:12:44,475
- Right.
- You guys didn't work.

2195
01:12:44,645 --> 01:12:47,374
- We brought all of this for us.
- We won.

2196
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:49,175
- We'll just have it then.
- We brought this.

2197
01:12:50,045 --> 01:12:52,045
Thank you for bringing us the snack.

2198
01:12:52,345 --> 01:12:53,345
Let's go.

2199
01:12:54,455 --> 01:12:56,654
(Under the green tree with the soft breeze)

2200
01:12:56,655 --> 01:12:58,684
- Gosh, it's here!
- What is it?

2201
01:12:58,685 --> 01:13:00,184
Help me take these out.

2202
01:13:00,185 --> 01:13:01,525
- Take them.
- What is it?

2203
01:13:02,355 --> 01:13:03,895
- Here.
- Is it soybean soup?

2204
01:13:04,465 --> 01:13:06,124
It comes in packs like these.

2205
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:07,264
That's so convenient.

2206
01:13:07,265 --> 01:13:08,565
- Take one each.
- What is that?

2207
01:13:08,895 --> 01:13:10,294
Do we just pour it into the bowls?

2208
01:13:10,295 --> 01:13:12,405
- Let's do that.
- It's really simple.

2209
01:13:16,135 --> 01:13:17,704
- Gosh.
- It looks great.

2210
01:13:17,705 --> 01:13:18,975
It looks amazing.

2211
01:13:19,505 --> 01:13:20,744
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

2212
01:13:20,745 --> 01:13:21,774
- Thank you.
- Enjoy it.

2213
01:13:21,775 --> 01:13:23,055
- Thank you.
- Great work today.

2214
01:13:23,245 --> 01:13:25,185
It looks like the ones served at restaurants.

2215
01:13:25,585 --> 01:13:27,025
- That's what it looks like.
- Gosh!

2216
01:13:27,755 --> 01:13:28,854
It's really cold.

2217
01:13:28,855 --> 01:13:30,555
It tastes amazing with the ice.

2218
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:36,524
I didn't expect much, but it feels rich and fresh.

2219
01:13:36,525 --> 01:13:38,825
- Right? It's refreshing.
- The soup. Yes.

2220
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:40,625
It's really savory.

2221
01:13:40,995 --> 01:13:42,665
The soup is so refreshing!

2222
01:13:43,835 --> 01:13:46,264
(Cold soybean soup with ice after working hard)

2223
01:13:46,265 --> 01:13:48,374
We should try the one made with black soybeans then.

2224
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:50,835
- That sounds good.
- We should.

2225
01:13:51,205 --> 01:13:52,574
It's different in color.

2226
01:13:52,575 --> 01:13:53,845
That's amazing.

2227
01:13:54,075 --> 01:13:55,245
Gosh.

2228
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,075
(Slurping)

2229
01:13:57,645 --> 01:13:59,245
Gosh, you're really enjoying it.

2230
01:13:59,845 --> 01:14:01,055
Se Yoon knows how to enjoy it.

2231
01:14:05,155 --> 01:14:07,755
I'm serious. It tastes just as good as the ones...

2232
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,494
- served at good restaurants.
- Right.

2233
01:14:09,495 --> 01:14:11,664
- You must have tried a lot of them.
- I have.

2234
01:14:11,665 --> 01:14:13,725
As Se Yoon is done eating, I'll make you something.

2235
01:14:14,065 --> 01:14:16,065
These are honey rice cakes.

2236
01:14:16,395 --> 01:14:18,034
Honey rice cakes with soybean soup?

2237
01:14:18,035 --> 01:14:20,204
It's a Gen MZ trend...

2238
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:22,335
to have honey rice cakes with soybean soup.

2239
01:14:22,505 --> 01:14:25,105
This is a true K-Dessert.

2240
01:14:30,275 --> 01:14:32,885
Hey, this is good.

2241
01:14:33,685 --> 01:14:34,815
This is good.

2242
01:14:36,285 --> 01:14:39,084
- Hey, - Gosh!

2243
01:14:39,085 --> 01:14:41,224
- this is good.
- Hey!

2244
01:14:41,225 --> 01:14:42,594
This is a trend.

2245
01:14:42,595 --> 01:14:44,125
(Aren't I right?)

2246
01:14:45,995 --> 01:14:47,225
It's so good.

2247
01:14:48,695 --> 01:14:49,765
Gosh, I feel full.

2248
01:14:49,965 --> 01:14:51,835
How can we be this full?

2249
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:54,034
This is really good.

2250
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:56,535
They go really well together.

2251
01:14:56,975 --> 01:14:58,205
Gosh, I feel full.

2252
01:14:58,345 --> 01:15:00,404
I should have one more as I might miss out on dinner.

2253
01:15:00,405 --> 01:15:01,565
(A way to enjoy May together)

2254
01:15:01,815 --> 01:15:04,045
(After the fun snack time...)

2255
01:15:04,415 --> 01:15:06,484
Gather up, everyone!

2256
01:15:06,485 --> 01:15:08,055
- What?
- There are raffle stickers!

2257
01:15:08,655 --> 01:15:09,714
(They spot something.)

2258
01:15:09,715 --> 01:15:11,475
- What is that?
- That was made really well.

2259
01:15:11,694 --> 01:15:12,733
(They spot something.)

2260
01:15:12,734 --> 01:15:14,403
- What is that?
- That was made really well.

2261
01:15:14,404 --> 01:15:16,164
"Mr. Joo's Raffle Board!"

2262
01:15:16,204 --> 01:15:17,774
(Mr. Joo's Raffle Board)

2263
01:15:17,934 --> 01:15:19,173
That was made really well.

2264
01:15:19,174 --> 01:15:21,044
What is that? Are we at a flea market?

2265
01:15:21,074 --> 01:15:23,573
"Make your draw! Mr. Joo's Raffle Board."

2266
01:15:23,574 --> 01:15:27,013
The ladies here gave us a warm welcome.

2267
01:15:27,014 --> 01:15:28,543
- Right.
- They were really warm-hearted.

2268
01:15:28,544 --> 01:15:30,453
We shouldn't just be receiving from them,

2269
01:15:30,454 --> 01:15:33,053
so we put together an opportunity to give back to them.

2270
01:15:33,054 --> 01:15:34,424
- Okay!
- That sounds great.

2271
01:15:34,854 --> 01:15:37,894
There are various missions hidden on the raffle board.

2272
01:15:37,924 --> 01:15:39,964
If you succeed in the mission you have drawn,

2273
01:15:40,094 --> 01:15:43,064
you can choose a gift to give to them.

2274
01:15:43,934 --> 01:15:44,934
Okay.

2275
01:15:44,935 --> 01:15:46,934
That one must be expensive.

2276
01:15:47,264 --> 01:15:49,303
But if you fail,

2277
01:15:49,304 --> 01:15:51,033
you will be considered to be lacking in effort...

2278
01:15:51,034 --> 01:15:53,343
and take a hit in the bottom by a table tennis racket...

2279
01:15:53,344 --> 01:15:54,544
just like we have done before.

2280
01:15:54,674 --> 01:15:55,674
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2281
01:15:55,904 --> 01:15:58,464
(During the Yeoju trip's battle between the staff and members, )

2282
01:15:58,814 --> 01:16:00,684
(Director Joo got a taste of a super smash.)

2283
01:16:01,044 --> 01:16:03,590
(After experiencing the smash that was enough to break the racket, )

2284
01:16:03,614 --> 01:16:06,354
(he was determined to use this as a penalty.)

2285
01:16:06,424 --> 01:16:08,023
- This is what I think.
- Yes?

2286
01:16:08,024 --> 01:16:09,454
He was upset about that moment.

2287
01:16:10,054 --> 01:16:11,253
Who will be the one to take the racket?

2288
01:16:11,254 --> 01:16:13,263
You will be lining up for this.

2289
01:16:13,264 --> 01:16:14,293
The one in the back will hit you.

2290
01:16:14,294 --> 01:16:16,264
- Okay.
- That's how it will be done.

2291
01:16:16,294 --> 01:16:17,733
I want to win that cane.

2292
01:16:17,734 --> 01:16:19,933
It looks really pretty. The cane or umbrella.

2293
01:16:19,934 --> 01:16:20,934
- Try holding it.
- Is it light?

2294
01:16:20,934 --> 01:16:21,934
It's really nice.

2295
01:16:21,935 --> 01:16:23,273
- It's of good quality.
- Gosh!

2296
01:16:23,274 --> 01:16:24,604
It's really light.

2297
01:16:24,674 --> 01:16:26,973
- It's really light.
- You can adjust the length too.

2298
01:16:26,974 --> 01:16:28,573
If you wish to play, we'll start...

2299
01:16:28,574 --> 01:16:30,213
- as soon as you line up.
- Me!

2300
01:16:30,214 --> 01:16:32,173
- All right.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2301
01:16:32,174 --> 01:16:33,890
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- All right.

2302
01:16:33,914 --> 01:16:35,283
Let's play rock-paper-scissors to settle things nicely.

2303
01:16:35,284 --> 01:16:36,924
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

2304
01:16:36,954 --> 01:16:38,954
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2305
01:16:39,054 --> 01:16:40,283
Okay.

2306
01:16:40,284 --> 01:16:41,654
- Okay. Here I go.
- All right.

2307
01:16:42,284 --> 01:16:45,353
- Make your draw!
- Fail!

2308
01:16:45,354 --> 01:16:47,063
- Make your draw!
- Fail!

2309
01:16:47,064 --> 01:16:48,523
He chose number four!

2310
01:16:48,524 --> 01:16:49,663
Stocking Pull Trick?

2311
01:16:49,664 --> 01:16:51,633
- Stocking Pull Trick!
- What is that?

2312
01:16:51,634 --> 01:16:53,204
- Everyone clap!
- Stocking Pull Trick!

2313
01:16:53,264 --> 01:16:55,403
- Who is second in line?
- It's me.

2314
01:16:55,404 --> 01:16:57,233
The second one in line. Here is the stocking.

2315
01:16:57,234 --> 01:16:58,674
- Why me?
- The second one in line.

2316
01:16:58,904 --> 01:17:02,003
Se Yoon will wear the stocking over his head.

2317
01:17:02,004 --> 01:17:03,073
DinDin will pull it out.

2318
01:17:03,074 --> 01:17:04,574
DinDin will pull out the stocking.

2319
01:17:05,444 --> 01:17:07,213
Isn't this a punishment for Se Yoon?

2320
01:17:07,214 --> 01:17:09,613
- Me? Why me?
- That's so unfortunate.

2321
01:17:09,614 --> 01:17:11,094
It will be hard to pull it out of me.

2322
01:17:11,784 --> 01:17:13,653
(He tries wearing it over his head.)

2323
01:17:13,654 --> 01:17:14,954
That looks fine.

2324
01:17:15,354 --> 01:17:17,453
- That's intense.
- It will get stuck on my chin.

2325
01:17:17,454 --> 01:17:18,493
(He's not being punished. He's just helping.)

2326
01:17:18,494 --> 01:17:19,763
Okay. That looks good enough.

2327
01:17:19,764 --> 01:17:20,993
He's ready.

2328
01:17:20,994 --> 01:17:22,623
Bend down a bit more.

2329
01:17:22,624 --> 01:17:24,364
Is it right for me to be doing this?

2330
01:17:24,894 --> 01:17:27,163
- That's so unfortunate.
- Is it right?

2331
01:17:27,164 --> 01:17:29,533
- He looks so ugly.
- Stay still!

2332
01:17:29,534 --> 01:17:30,534
My back hurts.

2333
01:17:30,535 --> 01:17:32,033
- Stay still!
- Hold on.

2334
01:17:32,034 --> 01:17:34,674
- Done.
- Here I go. One, two, three.

2335
01:17:37,014 --> 01:17:39,174
(A clean pull)

2336
01:17:39,644 --> 01:17:40,943
That was amazing.

2337
01:17:40,944 --> 01:17:41,990
(Stable as there's a lot of space)

2338
01:17:42,014 --> 01:17:43,384
- Did you do it?
- I did it.

2339
01:17:43,884 --> 01:17:44,913
Okay.

2340
01:17:44,914 --> 01:17:46,313
- Can I choose one?
- Yes. You may take one.

2341
01:17:46,314 --> 01:17:48,654
- Okay! I'll take the cane!
- Gosh.

2342
01:17:48,854 --> 01:17:50,893
Don't you have an electric fan?

2343
01:17:50,894 --> 01:17:52,254
(I wanted the crane too.)

2344
01:17:52,354 --> 01:17:54,323
- Next.
- Who's next?

2345
01:17:54,324 --> 01:17:56,633
I want to give a gift. Number nine.

2346
01:17:56,634 --> 01:17:57,894
He picked number nine.

2347
01:17:58,134 --> 01:17:59,164
Number nine.

2348
01:17:59,664 --> 01:18:01,403
- Magic Glasses.
- Magic Glasses.

2349
01:18:01,404 --> 01:18:03,033
- Magic Glasses.
- Magic Glasses is a game...

2350
01:18:03,034 --> 01:18:04,633
where you catch a cookie...

2351
01:18:04,634 --> 01:18:07,843
that Jae Hyun throws with your mouth wearing Jae Hyun's glasses.

2352
01:18:07,844 --> 01:18:08,973
It's difficult.

2353
01:18:08,974 --> 01:18:10,374
- It's too hard.
- I can't do that.

2354
01:18:10,814 --> 01:18:12,820
- You will throw up.
- It's like a magnifying glass.

2355
01:18:12,844 --> 01:18:15,613
It's like a blindfold. It's that bad.

2356
01:18:15,614 --> 01:18:16,614
Magic Glasses.

2357
01:18:16,615 --> 01:18:18,295
(Borrowing the Magic Glasses for a moment)

2358
01:18:19,114 --> 01:18:20,994
Jae Hyun's glasses are like a magnifying glass.

2359
01:18:21,324 --> 01:18:23,193
Can Jae Hyun throw this when he can barely see?

2360
01:18:23,194 --> 01:18:24,223
His eyesight is so bad.

2361
01:18:24,224 --> 01:18:26,154
- He can barely see.
- I can't see.

2362
01:18:26,894 --> 01:18:28,763
(It's dizzy as if he's wearing reading glasses.)

2363
01:18:28,764 --> 01:18:29,764
How can you see?

2364
01:18:29,765 --> 01:18:31,594
Both you and he can't see. Is that all right?

2365
01:18:31,934 --> 01:18:33,803
- Do I have only one chance?
- You have only one chance.

2366
01:18:33,804 --> 01:18:35,264
Magic Glasses. I'm ready.

2367
01:18:36,304 --> 01:18:40,074
(Will he be able to eat the cookie?)

2368
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:41,703
- There you go.
- There you go.

2369
01:18:41,704 --> 01:18:43,120
(It's going in the right direction.)

2370
01:18:43,144 --> 01:18:44,514
(Okay. Come on in.)

2371
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:47,544
(Exclaiming)

2372
01:18:48,514 --> 01:18:49,913
(The cookie bounces off his chin.)

2373
01:18:49,914 --> 01:18:51,053
He couldn't eat it.

2374
01:18:51,054 --> 01:18:52,083
- He failed.
- He failed.

2375
01:18:52,084 --> 01:18:53,753
But I'll give you the cookie.

2376
01:18:53,754 --> 01:18:55,323
- Spanking.
- We should spank him.

2377
01:18:55,324 --> 01:18:57,364
- Use the table tennis racket.
- It's so difficult.

2378
01:18:57,694 --> 01:18:59,994
The pants are tight, so it's easy to spank him.

2379
01:19:00,124 --> 01:19:01,963
My goodness. Look at his buttocks.

2380
01:19:01,964 --> 01:19:03,634
They look like a rocking stone.

2381
01:19:03,694 --> 01:19:04,933
Here I go.

2382
01:19:04,934 --> 01:19:06,763
It's loud, but it doesn't hurt.

2383
01:19:06,764 --> 01:19:08,704
Here I go. One, two, three.

2384
01:19:12,974 --> 01:19:15,174
(100 percent hitting power)

2385
01:19:17,344 --> 01:19:18,774
It sounds so satisfying.

2386
01:19:19,514 --> 01:19:21,513
It sounded like a gunpowder weapon.

2387
01:19:21,514 --> 01:19:23,730
(A destructive power comparable to the sound of a gunpowder gun)

2388
01:19:23,754 --> 01:19:25,613
- We don't have time.
- It's because of the pants.

2389
01:19:25,614 --> 01:19:27,423
- Go ahead and pick one.
- Pick one.

2390
01:19:27,424 --> 01:19:29,023
- Pick one carefully.
- Go ahead.

2391
01:19:29,024 --> 01:19:32,054
- Go ahead and pick one.
- He picked number 15.

2392
01:19:33,264 --> 01:19:35,894
- Losing Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- Losing Rock-Paper-Scissors.

2393
01:19:35,994 --> 01:19:37,763
This is the game where you play rock-paper-scissors to lose.

2394
01:19:37,764 --> 01:19:39,633
That's right. You will play rock-paper-scissors.

2395
01:19:39,634 --> 01:19:40,763
I'll play first.

2396
01:19:40,764 --> 01:19:41,963
Okay. I should see it first.

2397
01:19:41,964 --> 01:19:43,104
I'll show you how you do it.

2398
01:19:43,674 --> 01:19:44,874
Rock-paper-scissors, scissors.

2399
01:19:45,074 --> 01:19:46,233
- This is it.
- It's easy.

2400
01:19:46,234 --> 01:19:47,674
Then Seon Ho wins.

2401
01:19:47,804 --> 01:19:49,944
What about the speed? It goes like this?

2402
01:19:50,014 --> 01:19:53,814
Rock-paper-scissors. It should be like this.

2403
01:19:54,114 --> 01:19:56,183
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- It's easy.

2404
01:19:56,184 --> 01:19:57,253
You should play...

2405
01:19:57,254 --> 01:19:58,560
- a little later than me.
- Okay.

2406
01:19:58,584 --> 01:20:00,324
- I'm ready.
- Let's begin.

2407
01:20:00,554 --> 01:20:01,723
Rock-paper-scissors, scissors.

2408
01:20:01,724 --> 01:20:03,224
(Director Joo played scissors.)

2409
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:05,394
(If Jong Min plays paper, he wins.)

2410
01:20:05,424 --> 01:20:07,024
(What will he do?)

2411
01:20:07,164 --> 01:20:08,764
- Rock-paper-scissors, scissors.
- Rock.

2412
01:20:09,324 --> 01:20:10,433
- Rock-paper-scissors, scissors.
- Rock.

2413
01:20:10,434 --> 01:20:11,434
(He's supposed to lose, but he wins confidently.)

2414
01:20:11,435 --> 01:20:12,593
(Proud)

2415
01:20:12,594 --> 01:20:13,934
- You failed.
- You failed.

2416
01:20:14,334 --> 01:20:16,163
- It seemed easy.
- Why did you lose?

2417
01:20:16,164 --> 01:20:18,103
- Why did you lose?
- You should give it a try.

2418
01:20:18,104 --> 01:20:20,044
(It's time for a penalty.)

2419
01:20:20,104 --> 01:20:21,904
- Next up is Seon Ho.
- Okay.

2420
01:20:22,104 --> 01:20:23,374
Number 11.

2421
01:20:23,514 --> 01:20:25,014
He picked number 11.

2422
01:20:25,074 --> 01:20:26,273
It's Stocking Pull Trick again.

2423
01:20:26,274 --> 01:20:27,383
- Good.
- All right. One more time.

2424
01:20:27,384 --> 01:20:28,983
All right. Who's next?

2425
01:20:28,984 --> 01:20:30,084
Me.

2426
01:20:30,754 --> 01:20:32,914
- Stocking.
- I see.

2427
01:20:32,984 --> 01:20:34,253
So the stocking...

2428
01:20:34,254 --> 01:20:36,253
- goes to comedians in the end.
- Right.

2429
01:20:36,254 --> 01:20:37,954
I like doing things like this.

2430
01:20:39,554 --> 01:20:41,024
(Putting it on quickly)

2431
01:20:41,124 --> 01:20:42,324
- A little more?
- This is...

2432
01:20:43,164 --> 01:20:44,234
My goodness.

2433
01:20:44,534 --> 01:20:46,094
That looks better than your usual face.

2434
01:20:46,964 --> 01:20:48,533
Let me see. You look handsome.

2435
01:20:48,534 --> 01:20:49,534
This is better.

2436
01:20:49,534 --> 01:20:50,534
All right.

2437
01:20:51,134 --> 01:20:52,303
This isn't so bad.

2438
01:20:52,304 --> 01:20:53,943
- Do we need more water?
- Bend down a little more.

2439
01:20:53,944 --> 01:20:54,944
Put it on here.

2440
01:20:54,945 --> 01:20:57,414
Why is Sae Ho's face so bumpy?

2441
01:20:57,544 --> 01:20:59,114
I can't place a cup on it.

2442
01:20:59,844 --> 01:21:01,884
This part should be lower. Like this.

2443
01:21:01,944 --> 01:21:03,614
Once it's balanced, pull it right away.

2444
01:21:04,084 --> 01:21:05,684
- Okay.
- I'm ready.

2445
01:21:06,414 --> 01:21:08,584
(Will he be able to succeed?)

2446
01:21:09,154 --> 01:21:10,224
Seriously...

2447
01:21:12,354 --> 01:21:14,594
(Pulled)

2448
01:21:15,194 --> 01:21:17,334
(A close call)

2449
01:21:17,764 --> 01:21:18,764
(Yes, I can give a gift!)

2450
01:21:18,765 --> 01:21:19,963
- That was good.
- Nice.

2451
01:21:19,964 --> 01:21:21,363
- Good.
- This is easy.

2452
01:21:21,364 --> 01:21:22,780
- Nice.
- It's easier than I thought.

2453
01:21:22,804 --> 01:21:24,904
- It's easy if you pull it quickly.
- Who's next?

2454
01:21:24,934 --> 01:21:26,803
Isn't the cosmetic set the most expensive one?

2455
01:21:26,804 --> 01:21:28,104
You should think of the price.

2456
01:21:28,144 --> 01:21:29,773
- The price.
- Will the ladies like it?

2457
01:21:29,774 --> 01:21:31,644
They totally love this.

2458
01:21:31,714 --> 01:21:33,213
- I'll pick this.
- Okay.

2459
01:21:33,214 --> 01:21:34,314
Okay.

2460
01:21:34,614 --> 01:21:36,684
- All right. I'll give it a go.
- Okay.

2461
01:21:36,854 --> 01:21:39,384
(Getting more excited)

2462
01:21:39,614 --> 01:21:41,284
- Pick one.
- I picked it.

2463
01:21:41,854 --> 01:21:43,694
- Holding Back a Burp.
- What?

2464
01:21:43,794 --> 01:21:44,794
Holding Back a Burp.

2465
01:21:44,795 --> 01:21:46,323
After drinking a can of Coke...

2466
01:21:46,324 --> 01:21:47,923
- Dreams come true - and sing for 30 seconds...

2467
01:21:47,924 --> 01:21:49,663
- while holding back a burp.
- Okay.

2468
01:21:49,664 --> 01:21:50,893
- Sing a song?
- That's not easy.

2469
01:21:50,894 --> 01:21:52,133
What song should I sing?

2470
01:21:52,134 --> 01:21:53,403
Sing any song you want.

2471
01:21:53,404 --> 01:21:54,563
She goes outside

2472
01:21:54,564 --> 01:21:55,603
Let's go with this song.

2473
01:21:55,604 --> 01:21:56,934
Okay. I'll start.

2474
01:21:57,474 --> 01:22:05,014
(A difficult song to sing with a long breath)

2475
01:22:05,144 --> 01:22:06,914
- Here I go.
- You have to hold it.

2476
01:22:07,484 --> 01:22:08,713
- All right.
- Can you drink it in one go?

2477
01:22:08,714 --> 01:22:09,714
Open up your throat.

2478
01:22:09,715 --> 01:22:11,553
It's not easy to drink it up.

2479
01:22:11,554 --> 01:22:13,013
He's doing it well. His throat is wide open.

2480
01:22:13,014 --> 01:22:15,000
- How does he do that?
- I can't even finish a beer.

2481
01:22:15,024 --> 01:22:16,823
It's open. He opened it up.

2482
01:22:16,824 --> 01:22:19,123
He just swallows it right away.

2483
01:22:19,124 --> 01:22:20,293
- I want to burp already.
- My gosh.

2484
01:22:20,294 --> 01:22:22,724
I'm jealous though.

2485
01:22:22,864 --> 01:22:23,934
Start.

2486
01:22:24,494 --> 01:22:25,733
(The 30-second countdown begins.)

2487
01:22:25,734 --> 01:22:27,603
She goes

2488
01:22:27,604 --> 01:22:29,033
(Is he facing a crisis already?)

2489
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:31,733
Outside

2490
01:22:31,734 --> 01:22:34,404
He's tearing up.

2491
01:22:35,004 --> 01:22:37,213
(Tearing up)

2492
01:22:37,214 --> 01:22:38,694
(He desperately holds back his burp.)

2493
01:22:39,274 --> 01:22:40,284
But...

2494
01:22:40,444 --> 01:22:41,744
- Oh, dear.
- My goodness.

2495
01:22:41,844 --> 01:22:42,844
But...

2496
01:22:42,845 --> 01:22:47,584
(He lets out a big burp.)

2497
01:22:47,684 --> 01:22:49,124
- Oh no.
- It stinks.

2498
01:22:49,424 --> 01:22:50,723
- Did he throw up?
- Gosh.

2499
01:22:50,724 --> 01:22:52,493
Darn it. I can smell soybean soup noodles.

2500
01:22:52,494 --> 01:22:53,763
I smell soybeans.

2501
01:22:53,764 --> 01:22:55,393
(The nutty smell spreads throughout the town.)

2502
01:22:55,394 --> 01:22:58,233
Hey. What kind of soybean soup was that?

2503
01:22:58,234 --> 01:22:59,594
- Again.
- It smells so nutty.

2504
01:23:00,734 --> 01:23:01,963
I'm tearing up.

2505
01:23:01,964 --> 01:23:03,203
(Sae Ho fails.)

2506
01:23:03,204 --> 01:23:04,273
Go ahead and burp as much as you want.

2507
01:23:04,274 --> 01:23:06,674
(Time for a penalty)

2508
01:23:07,574 --> 01:23:08,574
Chang Sun.

2509
01:23:08,574 --> 01:23:09,574
(Lee Joon is up next.)

2510
01:23:09,575 --> 01:23:10,813
I pick number seven.

2511
01:23:10,814 --> 01:23:12,774
- Lucky 7.
- Number 7.

2512
01:23:12,944 --> 01:23:15,304
- Losing Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- Losing Rock-Paper-Scissors.

2513
01:23:15,514 --> 01:23:16,883
Losing Rock-Paper-Scissors is really easy.

2514
01:23:16,884 --> 01:23:17,884
It's really easy.

2515
01:23:17,885 --> 01:23:19,453
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

2516
01:23:19,454 --> 01:23:20,984
- It goes like this.
- Okay.

2517
01:23:21,024 --> 01:23:22,053
(They love it.)

2518
01:23:22,054 --> 01:23:23,523
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.

2519
01:23:23,524 --> 01:23:24,923
- You should play right away.
- Go.

2520
01:23:24,924 --> 01:23:26,993
All right. Rock-paper-scissors, go.

2521
01:23:26,994 --> 01:23:28,724
(Director Joo plays paper.)

2522
01:23:29,164 --> 01:23:31,434
(If Joon plays rock, he wins.)

2523
01:23:31,794 --> 01:23:33,294
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Go.

2524
01:23:33,464 --> 01:23:34,503
Okay.

2525
01:23:34,504 --> 01:23:35,504
- Go.
- Go.

2526
01:23:35,505 --> 01:23:37,074
(Failed)

2527
01:23:37,204 --> 01:23:38,924
Where are you going? You should be spanked.

2528
01:23:38,974 --> 01:23:40,973
(Time for a penalty)

2529
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,643
Can you give us more chances?

2530
01:23:42,644 --> 01:23:44,213
You can try again if you want.

2531
01:23:44,214 --> 01:23:45,450
- Okay.
- All right. One more time.

2532
01:23:45,474 --> 01:23:47,644
Are you going to take more?

2533
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:48,814
Number eight.

2534
01:23:49,084 --> 01:23:50,984
- Number eight.
- Breaking Chopsticks.

2535
01:23:51,054 --> 01:23:52,553
- Using your buttocks.
- Buttocks?

2536
01:23:52,554 --> 01:23:55,354
You should break chopsticks using your buttocks.

2537
01:23:55,524 --> 01:23:56,784
That's a lot of chopsticks.

2538
01:23:57,124 --> 01:23:58,623
This is impossible. You have too many chopsticks.

2539
01:23:58,624 --> 01:23:59,693
That's a lot.

2540
01:23:59,694 --> 01:24:01,163
- I run.
- Okay.

2541
01:24:01,164 --> 01:24:02,624
My thighs are as hard as rocks.

2542
01:24:02,894 --> 01:24:04,634
DinDin, show us that you have no problem.

2543
01:24:04,764 --> 01:24:06,163
Let's begin. Ready.

2544
01:24:06,164 --> 01:24:07,280
(I'll break them in one go.)

2545
01:24:07,304 --> 01:24:08,863
Start.

2546
01:24:08,864 --> 01:24:09,904
(Exclaiming)

2547
01:24:10,534 --> 01:24:12,774
Get up. You should stand up straight.

2548
01:24:12,974 --> 01:24:16,503
(They had high expectations as he said he ran.)

2549
01:24:16,504 --> 01:24:17,773
Stretch your back.

2550
01:24:17,774 --> 01:24:19,543
- This is hilarious.
- Stretch your back.

2551
01:24:19,544 --> 01:24:21,684
(Struggling)

2552
01:24:21,914 --> 01:24:23,553
- Stretch your back.
- Hey.

2553
01:24:23,554 --> 01:24:25,183
Hey, you should stand straight up.

2554
01:24:25,184 --> 01:24:26,253
- Stretch your back.
- Your back.

2555
01:24:26,254 --> 01:24:27,454
(Like this?)

2556
01:24:27,584 --> 01:24:29,524
(Disappointed)

2557
01:24:29,624 --> 01:24:31,354
He's sticking out his front teeth.

2558
01:24:31,694 --> 01:24:33,253
(He is struggling with his front teeth sticking out.)

2559
01:24:33,254 --> 01:24:34,464
Your front teeth.

2560
01:24:36,564 --> 01:24:37,634
Failed.

2561
01:24:37,934 --> 01:24:39,764
- How can you break them?
- Oh, no.

2562
01:24:39,834 --> 01:24:40,834
By the way, this is...

2563
01:24:40,835 --> 01:24:42,063
It's impossible.

2564
01:24:42,064 --> 01:24:44,173
Can other members try it?

2565
01:24:44,174 --> 01:24:46,204
- Shall we let them give it a try?
- Okay.

2566
01:24:46,374 --> 01:24:47,773
- Good.
- Let's do that.

2567
01:24:47,774 --> 01:24:49,020
- I'll go first.
- It wouldn't even budge.

2568
01:24:49,044 --> 01:24:50,843
You would break your feet. Are you okay?

2569
01:24:50,844 --> 01:24:52,544
- All right.
- I want to give it a try.

2570
01:24:52,814 --> 01:24:54,183
No. You can't do that.

2571
01:24:54,184 --> 01:24:55,613
Seon Ho, show us the power of dry firewood.

2572
01:24:55,614 --> 01:24:57,353
- Okay. Let's begin.
- I think...

2573
01:24:57,354 --> 01:24:58,954
it feels just right.

2574
01:24:59,254 --> 01:25:00,723
Start.

2575
01:25:00,724 --> 01:25:01,724
It's done.

2576
01:25:01,854 --> 01:25:03,724
Pull it hard. It's touching your bones.

2577
01:25:04,194 --> 01:25:05,324
It's touching your bones.

2578
01:25:05,494 --> 01:25:08,063
(He's struggling until the chopsticks touch his bones.)

2579
01:25:08,064 --> 01:25:09,464
It's touching your bones.

2580
01:25:09,524 --> 01:25:10,934
Pull harder.

2581
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:14,104
(Feeling bad for him)

2582
01:25:14,164 --> 01:25:15,903
Tighten your buttocks and thighs.

2583
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:17,204
- Tighten them.
- Thighs!

2584
01:25:17,304 --> 01:25:18,433
(He pulls it hard, but the chopsticks won't budge.)

2585
01:25:18,434 --> 01:25:19,773
I don't think it's working.

2586
01:25:19,774 --> 01:25:21,550
(He pulls it hard, but the chopsticks won't budge.)

2587
01:25:21,574 --> 01:25:23,104
(Struggling)

2588
01:25:23,274 --> 01:25:24,944
- I'm dizzy.
- Hey.

2589
01:25:25,474 --> 01:25:27,584
- I can't do this. I give up.
- He can't do it.

2590
01:25:27,784 --> 01:25:29,284
His face was so funny.

2591
01:25:29,484 --> 01:25:30,754
Show us, Jong Min.

2592
01:25:31,354 --> 01:25:32,984
(Jong Min is up next.)

2593
01:25:34,724 --> 01:25:36,054
It hurts.

2594
01:25:36,254 --> 01:25:37,693
(Sae Ho is the next one to try.)

2595
01:25:37,694 --> 01:25:38,723
- Hey.
- My goodness.

2596
01:25:38,724 --> 01:25:40,363
This is my specialty.

2597
01:25:40,364 --> 01:25:41,393
Why is this so hard?

2598
01:25:41,394 --> 01:25:42,493
(Gym Lover Lee Joon tries.)

2599
01:25:42,494 --> 01:25:43,894
You're almost there. One more time.

2600
01:25:43,964 --> 01:25:45,164
It's not working at all.

2601
01:25:45,594 --> 01:25:47,203
- All right.
- Pull harder.

2602
01:25:47,204 --> 01:25:50,064
(Even Lee Joon failed.)

2603
01:25:50,234 --> 01:25:51,733
(See? It's hard.)

2604
01:25:51,734 --> 01:25:52,873
My hands hurt a lot.

2605
01:25:52,874 --> 01:25:54,150
- All right.
- You need know-how.

2606
01:25:54,174 --> 01:25:55,243
How do you do this?

2607
01:25:55,244 --> 01:25:57,073
- All right. Show us, Se Yoon.
- Try it.

2608
01:25:57,074 --> 01:25:58,143
Give it a try.

2609
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:00,174
Se Yoon will show us what strength is.

2610
01:26:00,544 --> 01:26:02,913
Se Yoon is really strong. I'm sure he can do this.

2611
01:26:02,914 --> 01:26:04,253
Se Yoon can do this.

2612
01:26:04,254 --> 01:26:06,084
I might faint if I keep trying.

2613
01:26:06,484 --> 01:26:08,323
It's stuck. It went inside.

2614
01:26:08,324 --> 01:26:10,023
Okay. It should go in.

2615
01:26:10,024 --> 01:26:11,153
(The chopsticks are about to go into his buttocks.)

2616
01:26:11,154 --> 01:26:12,753
Pull them out if they go in.

2617
01:26:12,754 --> 01:26:14,094
- Okay.
- Here I go.

2618
01:26:14,194 --> 01:26:16,623
(Everyone has failed.)

2619
01:26:16,624 --> 01:26:18,694
(Will he be able to succeed?)

2620
01:26:18,764 --> 01:26:19,794
Here I go.

2621
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:22,934
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

2622
01:26:23,364 --> 01:26:25,604
(Pulling hard)

2623
01:26:27,644 --> 01:26:29,444
(One shot, one kill.)

2624
01:26:29,674 --> 01:26:30,813
(Disastrous)

2625
01:26:30,814 --> 01:26:32,674
My gosh. Moon Se Yoon!

2626
01:26:32,774 --> 01:26:34,343
(Truly monstrous strength)

2627
01:26:34,344 --> 01:26:35,714
(Jaw-dropping)

2628
01:26:35,914 --> 01:26:37,953
(Did you see that, weaklings?)

2629
01:26:37,954 --> 01:26:39,084
He's different.

2630
01:26:39,754 --> 01:26:42,124
(They were stuck close to the buttocks like a magnet.)

2631
01:26:42,154 --> 01:26:45,124
(Shattered)

2632
01:26:45,824 --> 01:26:47,223
- I knew it.
- My goodness.

2633
01:26:47,224 --> 01:26:49,164
- What was that?
- As expected.

2634
01:26:49,224 --> 01:26:50,493
That was amazing.

2635
01:26:50,494 --> 01:26:52,033
- My goodness.
- Was it that easy?

2636
01:26:52,034 --> 01:26:53,063
What should I pick?

2637
01:26:53,064 --> 01:26:54,103
Which one do you want?

2638
01:26:54,104 --> 01:26:55,763
Ginger, schizandra, black raspberry.

2639
01:26:55,764 --> 01:26:57,003
Black raspberry tea sounds great.

2640
01:26:57,004 --> 01:26:58,773
- I didn't get any.
- Me neither.

2641
01:26:58,774 --> 01:26:59,834
I have nothing to give.

2642
01:26:59,934 --> 01:27:02,343
I recommend you choose number 16.

2643
01:27:02,344 --> 01:27:03,913
- This?
- Those who haven't won anything...

2644
01:27:03,914 --> 01:27:05,144
should try number 16.

2645
01:27:05,274 --> 01:27:06,674
- Joon, you do it.
- Number 16.

2646
01:27:07,314 --> 01:27:08,343
Joon.

2647
01:27:08,344 --> 01:27:09,684
- Dialect Quiz.
- Dialect Quiz.

2648
01:27:09,744 --> 01:27:11,053
This is Dialect Quiz.

2649
01:27:11,054 --> 01:27:12,553
A staff member who's from Gyeongsang Province...

2650
01:27:12,554 --> 01:27:14,183
will read the quiz.

2651
01:27:14,184 --> 01:27:16,183
If you guess the exact meaning of it,

2652
01:27:16,184 --> 01:27:17,453
- you succeed.
- Okay.

2653
01:27:17,454 --> 01:27:19,594
- Joon has a chance to answer first.
- Okay.

2654
01:27:19,754 --> 01:27:21,023
If Joon gets it wrong,

2655
01:27:21,024 --> 01:27:23,094
- the other members can answer.
- Okay.

2656
01:27:23,194 --> 01:27:25,494
- Where's the staff member?
- Who's that?

2657
01:27:25,934 --> 01:27:27,233
- What?
- Is it her?

2658
01:27:27,234 --> 01:27:28,433
- Where are you from?
- Daegu.

2659
01:27:28,434 --> 01:27:29,763
- Daegu? Really?
- I see.

2660
01:27:29,764 --> 01:27:30,903
Are you from Daegu?

2661
01:27:30,904 --> 01:27:32,774
Here's the question.

2662
01:27:32,934 --> 01:27:34,303
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

2663
01:27:34,304 --> 01:27:36,403
Why are you so "kkaelbat" these days?

2664
01:27:36,404 --> 01:27:37,913
You're so "kkaelbat."

2665
01:27:37,914 --> 01:27:39,343
I'm so "kkaelbat?"

2666
01:27:39,344 --> 01:27:40,884
- "Kkaelbat?"
- "Kkaelbat?"

2667
01:27:41,084 --> 01:27:43,243
Why are you so "kkaelbat" these days?

2668
01:27:43,244 --> 01:27:44,614
- "Kkaelbat?"
- I got it.

2669
01:27:44,754 --> 01:27:46,653
You should be careful about giving your answer.

2670
01:27:46,654 --> 01:27:47,984
- I'm being careful.
- Okay.

2671
01:27:49,354 --> 01:27:50,654
Why are you so thin?

2672
01:27:51,354 --> 01:27:53,793
Incorrect! The others can have a go.

2673
01:27:53,794 --> 01:27:55,564
It's not a positive word.

2674
01:27:56,324 --> 01:27:58,694
- Sae Ho!
- Sae Ho.

2675
01:27:58,794 --> 01:28:00,134
Why are you so dull and slow?

2676
01:28:00,564 --> 01:28:01,704
Incorrect!

2677
01:28:01,964 --> 01:28:04,573
- DinDin! Why are you so stupid?
- I got it!

2678
01:28:04,574 --> 01:28:06,604
- Why are you so idiotic?
- Incorrect!

2679
01:28:07,244 --> 01:28:09,674
Why are you so clumsy and just...

2680
01:28:10,004 --> 01:28:11,513
- so hard to handle?
- What?

2681
01:28:11,514 --> 01:28:13,413
That's too long. Keep it short.

2682
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:14,483
(Just curse them out.)

2683
01:28:14,484 --> 01:28:16,143
Se Yoon. You smell.

2684
01:28:16,144 --> 01:28:18,814
Seon Ho! Why did you get so lazy?

2685
01:28:20,114 --> 01:28:21,484
Yes, it's something like that.

2686
01:28:23,684 --> 01:28:25,994
- Correct.
- It was that.

2687
01:28:26,124 --> 01:28:27,293
What did I do?

2688
01:28:27,294 --> 01:28:28,893
(Jong Min's upset.)

2689
01:28:28,894 --> 01:28:30,323
Why are you so lazy?

2690
01:28:30,324 --> 01:28:32,163
- Why are you lazy?
- It's annoying.

2691
01:28:32,164 --> 01:28:34,463
- You're lazy, you know.
- Do as you're told.

2692
01:28:34,464 --> 01:28:36,204
- You're lazy.
- Seon Ho, choose something.

2693
01:28:36,234 --> 01:28:38,133
Great, I got two. I'll take this, then.

2694
01:28:38,134 --> 01:28:39,733
- Okay.
- I want another go.

2695
01:28:39,734 --> 01:28:40,943
I haven't guessed one yet.

2696
01:28:40,944 --> 01:28:42,543
Can we do one more dialect quiz?

2697
01:28:42,544 --> 01:28:44,673
- Let's do that. The gifts must go.
- Okay.

2698
01:28:44,674 --> 01:28:45,743
Let's have another try.

2699
01:28:45,744 --> 01:28:47,643
- Okay, go ahead.
- Give us the question.

2700
01:28:47,644 --> 01:28:50,784
Our director is very "boondap."

2701
01:28:51,254 --> 01:28:53,113
- "Boondap?"
- He's very "boondap."

2702
01:28:53,114 --> 01:28:54,323
- Sae Ho.
- "Boondap."

2703
01:28:54,324 --> 01:28:56,454
- This isn't positive either.
- "Boondap?"

2704
01:28:56,584 --> 01:28:57,993
- Jong Min!
- Jong Min.

2705
01:28:57,994 --> 01:28:59,493
Why do you stutter?

2706
01:28:59,494 --> 01:29:01,494
- Incorrect.
- You answered with a stutter.

2707
01:29:02,024 --> 01:29:03,394
- Why...
- Sae Ho!

2708
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:04,933
You're not reliable.

2709
01:29:04,934 --> 01:29:06,133
- DinDin.
- Incorrect.

2710
01:29:06,134 --> 01:29:08,034
- DinDin. You're corrupt.
- Yes?

2711
01:29:08,834 --> 01:29:10,804
You're so very "boondap."

2712
01:29:11,274 --> 01:29:13,774
Seon Ho. You're chaotic.

2713
01:29:14,174 --> 01:29:15,374
Like he's all over the place?

2714
01:29:15,404 --> 01:29:16,944
- I'm right?
- Correct.

2715
01:29:17,614 --> 01:29:19,873
- That's right?
- It means "to be unfocused."

2716
01:29:19,874 --> 01:29:21,943
- That is so you. It's you.
- Then...

2717
01:29:21,944 --> 01:29:24,254
Why do you keep guessing when it's our quiz?

2718
01:29:24,814 --> 01:29:26,214
Let's us three play.

2719
01:29:26,554 --> 01:29:28,054
I want my granny to have a comb.

2720
01:29:28,684 --> 01:29:31,323
- It's fun. Let's play again.
- Not again. Don't be greedy.

2721
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:33,293
Me, Joon, and Jong Min have no presents?

2722
01:29:33,294 --> 01:29:35,193
- Hands up if you have none.
- We have nothing yet.

2723
01:29:35,194 --> 01:29:36,993
We played a few games,

2724
01:29:36,994 --> 01:29:38,993
but you aren't satisfied...

2725
01:29:38,994 --> 01:29:40,333
- with what you shopped.
- No.

2726
01:29:40,334 --> 01:29:42,303
We prepared a group gift.

2727
01:29:42,304 --> 01:29:44,474
- Let's get this.
- Bring it in, please.

2728
01:29:44,734 --> 01:29:46,704
- What's the group gift?
- Something's here.

2729
01:29:48,104 --> 01:29:49,773
- It's big.
- What is it?

2730
01:29:49,774 --> 01:29:51,413
- What's that?
- I want that.

2731
01:29:51,414 --> 01:29:53,413
- Bedding.
- Summer's around the corner,

2732
01:29:53,414 --> 01:29:55,883
- and we want them to sleep well.
- That's great.

2733
01:29:55,884 --> 01:29:57,914
We bought a summer bedding set.

2734
01:29:58,154 --> 01:29:59,383
We bought them,

2735
01:29:59,384 --> 01:30:02,354
but whether they get them or not depends on you.

2736
01:30:02,654 --> 01:30:03,893
- They must get them.
- What do we do?

2737
01:30:03,894 --> 01:30:04,993
- Okay.
- What should we do?

2738
01:30:04,994 --> 01:30:08,793
If all six of you jump a rope together 15 times,

2739
01:30:08,794 --> 01:30:12,033
each granny will get a new set of bedding.

2740
01:30:12,034 --> 01:30:14,603
What use do you have for the leftover gifts?

2741
01:30:14,604 --> 01:30:16,563
- Give them all if we succeed.
- Okay!

2742
01:30:16,564 --> 01:30:17,703
We'll try to succeed.

2743
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:20,404
The condition is, you must jump in one by one,

2744
01:30:20,604 --> 01:30:23,503
and we'll start counting when the last member comes in.

2745
01:30:23,504 --> 01:30:24,943
- Okay.
- Understood.

2746
01:30:24,944 --> 01:30:25,944
Okay.

2747
01:30:25,945 --> 01:30:28,514
- We can do 100.
- You know what we're like.

2748
01:30:28,544 --> 01:30:30,583
- Let's set things up.
- Okay!

2749
01:30:30,584 --> 01:30:32,813
Okay. Are you ready?

2750
01:30:32,814 --> 01:30:33,953
(Can they win all the presents?)

2751
01:30:33,954 --> 01:30:36,723
- Let's do it in one go.
- It'll be harder if we fail now.

2752
01:30:36,724 --> 01:30:37,893
- In one go.
- Let's go!

2753
01:30:37,894 --> 01:30:39,823
Sort out your positions.

2754
01:30:39,824 --> 01:30:41,493
We'll beat up whoever trips up.

2755
01:30:41,494 --> 01:30:42,774
Move forward as much as you can.

2756
01:30:43,494 --> 01:30:45,663
(Actually, Lee Joon...)

2757
01:30:45,664 --> 01:30:49,003
(is terrible at jumping in.)

2758
01:30:49,004 --> 01:30:51,704
(He's a group jump rope novice.)

2759
01:30:52,204 --> 01:30:53,703
- Don't trip up.
- We can't mess up...

2760
01:30:53,704 --> 01:30:55,024
when we're visiting our grandmas.

2761
01:30:55,274 --> 01:30:57,043
- Do I go first?
- Do whatever you want.

2762
01:30:57,044 --> 01:30:58,273
It's our first try.

2763
01:30:58,274 --> 01:30:59,974
- Go ahead!
- Now?

2764
01:31:00,884 --> 01:31:02,644
One by one.

2765
01:31:03,384 --> 01:31:05,283
(Sae Ho quickly jumps in.)

2766
01:31:05,284 --> 01:31:06,284
(Looking nervous)

2767
01:31:06,285 --> 01:31:07,854
It's hard, but let's do it!

2768
01:31:08,754 --> 01:31:10,654
(He snagged the rope?)

2769
01:31:12,294 --> 01:31:14,193
Good! You jumped over it!

2770
01:31:14,194 --> 01:31:16,024
(That was close.)

2771
01:31:16,894 --> 01:31:18,534
(Jong Min's in.)

2772
01:31:19,934 --> 01:31:21,064
One!

2773
01:31:21,334 --> 01:31:23,303
- Okay!
- Two!

2774
01:31:23,304 --> 01:31:25,173
Three, four,

2775
01:31:25,174 --> 01:31:27,233
- five, it's too fast.
- Five.

2776
01:31:27,234 --> 01:31:28,903
- It's fast! Eight!
- Eight,

2777
01:31:28,904 --> 01:31:30,674
- nine, ten.
- Nine, ten!

2778
01:31:31,474 --> 01:31:32,543
(They managed 10.)

2779
01:31:32,544 --> 01:31:34,483
Eleven, twelve!

2780
01:31:34,484 --> 01:31:36,044
(They're almost there.)

2781
01:31:36,214 --> 01:31:37,953
Thirteen, fourteen!

2782
01:31:37,954 --> 01:31:39,653
(They managed 14.)

2783
01:31:39,654 --> 01:31:42,384
(Just one more, and they succeed.)

2784
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:46,224
(Can they win all the presents?)

2785
01:31:46,324 --> 01:31:48,763
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen.

2786
01:31:48,764 --> 01:31:50,364
- We did it!
- We did it!

2787
01:31:50,564 --> 01:31:51,793
- Yes!
- We did it!

2788
01:31:51,794 --> 01:31:53,333
How many? It's a success?

2789
01:31:53,334 --> 01:31:54,503
- We did it?
- We did it!

2790
01:31:54,504 --> 01:31:55,834
- We did it!
- Success!

2791
01:31:56,804 --> 01:31:58,874
- We got them.
- Okay.

2792
01:31:59,174 --> 01:32:01,943
Okay!

2793
01:32:01,944 --> 01:32:03,474
Well done, everyone.

2794
01:32:03,544 --> 01:32:05,713
Pass them to the grannies.

2795
01:32:05,714 --> 01:32:06,844
Thank you.

2796
01:32:07,344 --> 01:32:09,244
- This is great.
- You can head over...

2797
01:32:09,314 --> 01:32:12,113
- with the presents you won.
- Okay.

2798
01:32:12,114 --> 01:32:14,024
(Next episode)

2799
01:32:14,384 --> 01:32:16,984
(We've won you some presents.)

2800
01:32:17,724 --> 01:32:20,054
(Wait. Where did they all go?)

2801
01:32:20,524 --> 01:32:22,724
(The grandmas are nowhere to be seen.)

2802
01:32:23,064 --> 01:32:25,194
(What on earth happened?)

2803
01:32:25,664 --> 01:32:27,193
(There's no trace of them.)

2804
01:32:27,194 --> 01:32:30,164
(Grandma, where are you?)

2805
01:32:30,434 --> 01:32:32,874
(Are you looking for us?)

2806
01:32:37,674 --> 01:32:40,684
(They completely changed into hip-hop warriors.)

2807
01:32:41,144 --> 01:32:42,944
(Are you ready to be hip?)

2808
01:32:44,154 --> 01:32:45,614
(You bet.)

2809
01:32:46,014 --> 01:32:48,624
(With the hippest grannies in the world, )

2810
01:32:49,184 --> 01:32:52,324
(join us for the exciting Family Month Special.)

2811
01:32:52,454 --> 01:32:54,364
(If you're ready to have fun...)
