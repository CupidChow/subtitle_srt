1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,440
(Welcome to the folk village.)

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,610
I haven't been here in so long.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,640
The folk village smell.
It's been a while.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,880
(A famous Yongin
tourist destination)

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,050
Oh, the smell. Pine trees.

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,350
(Hello.)

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,120
I last visited
when I was in elementary school.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,720
It's a person from long ago.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,730
(Exclaiming)

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,600
(Hello.)

12
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,430
- Hello.
- Hello.

13
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,430
(Nice to meet you.)

14
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,630
- Hello.
- Hello.

15
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,740
They look like
they're from the past.

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,940
Right?

17
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,940
(Fascinated)

18
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,540
Aren't we here for dessert?

19
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,510
Yes, we came to have dessert.

20
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,540
Yes.

21
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,280
- What's this?
- What is this?

22
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,510
What's what?

23
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,580
- This looks like fun.
- There must be a game.

24
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,150
- It looks like fun.
- What is it?

25
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,590
(A small watermelon field
in the folk village)

26
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,990
(Are we having watermelon
for dessert?)

27
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,030
It looks like fun.

28
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,060
There are watermelons.

29
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,560
- My gosh.
- What was that?

30
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,260
- My gosh.
- What was that?

31
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,700
What is that?

32
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,800
(A welcome shower)

33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
- What's that?
- Water?

34
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,830
What is this?

35
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,840
- My gosh.
- I was startled.

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,000
- What is it?
- My clothes are barely dry.

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,670
(His clothes are barely dry...)

38
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,070
The best summer dessert is...

39
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,540
fresh watermelon.

40
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,810
- Watermelon.
- Yes.

41
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,780
We brought you here
because this place...

42
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,220
is famous for its watermelon.

43
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,820
(Their watermelon hwachae
is delicious.)

44
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,790
Only those who steal a watermelon...

45
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,960
without getting caught
by the villagers...

46
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,290
will get some watermelon hwachae.

47
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,360
Where are the villagers?

48
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,400
They'll join us later.

49
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,830
- There are residents?
- There's an owner?

50
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,200
Yes. If they catch you...

51
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,600
before you cross the finish line,

52
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,970
to deter you
from committing future crimes,

53
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,140
they'll drench you with a shower.

54
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,210
Stay alert.

55
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,270
(A penalty shower)

56
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,240
We'll do a luck draw to see...

57
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,050
which villager will come after you.

58
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,050
They're all different?

59
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,910
- It's not us.
- There are a few residents.

60
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,950
- Pick one.
- Let's go.

61
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,650
What's this?

62
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,190
- I have a bad feeling.
- We got the same one.

63
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,390
- Joon, show yours first.
- What's this?

64
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,290
- The Youth President.
- Seon Ho?

65
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,260
Also the Youth President,
who might be a fast runner.

66
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,560
- I got Su-niper.
- "Su-niper?"

67
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,730
Will you get shot?

68
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,200
I got Passionate Farmer.

69
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,900
Passionate Farmer.

70
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,240
- What's "Su-niper?"
- What's that?

71
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,040
Will they shoot from a distance?

72
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,770
Shoot a watermelon?

73
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,070
This is like an assassination.

74
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,540
Let's meet the villagers.

75
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,740
- There are three of them?
- Yes.

76
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,950
Come on in!

77
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,250
Hello. Nice to meet you all.

78
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,420
- What's this?
- What's going on?

79
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,290
- What's this?
- What's going on?

80
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,720
Su-niper looks tough.

81
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,420
Why are you dressed like that?

82
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,420
What is that?

83
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,560
Hello.

84
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,290
Welcome, all of you.

85
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,160
Word has spread
that you came here...

86
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,400
to try and steal our watermelons.

87
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,970
The village Watermelon Guards...

88
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,370
came over to put you in your place.

89
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,840
(They're famous people
in the folk village.)

90
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,180
Come at me.

91
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,250
(Youth President)

92
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,650
Come on in.

93
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,620
(Passionate Farmer)

94
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,880
Are you scared?

95
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,020
(Su-niper)

96
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,660
It's time
for the Watermelon Thief Family...

97
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,160
to take on the Watermelon Guards
and see who wins!

98
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,430
- Yes!
- Let's do it!

99
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,160
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

100
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,600
(Watermelon Stealing Match)

101
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,900
(Watermelon Thief Family
versus Watermelon Guards)

102
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,130
I'll take on anyone.

103
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,300
It's pretty obvious we'll win.

104
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,470
Is the first baby ready?

105
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,110
(Lee Joon, younger twin)

106
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,670
(Just turned one,
Physically well-developed)

107
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,710
(More timid than he looks)

108
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,280
Come on in if you're ready.

109
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,810
Wait, that stance is no joke.

110
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,980
Look at his arms.

111
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,720
(The bulging arms of a one year old)

112
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,650
Look at those shoulders.

113
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,450
His shoulders are incredible.

114
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,560
(I'm proud of my grandson.)

115
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,190
Come over when you want to.

116
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,330
- He's our ace.
- Ready, get set, go!

117
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,800
- Go on, our team ace.
- Show them your muscles!

118
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,930
(The first thief sets off.)

119
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,960
(I'm over here.)

120
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,200
You'll take forever.

121
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,830
How much longer must we wait?

122
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,840
- Come on.
- Joon.

123
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,340
- I'm so nervous.
- He's a baby.

124
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,610
I'm so nervous.

125
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,270
(You can do it.)

126
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,540
Is there a strategy to it?

127
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,980
I'm too nervous to do anything.

128
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,210
My heart almost hurts.

129
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,180
My chest hurts.

130
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,750
(Stealing a watermelon
is nerve-racking.)

131
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,280
Joon!

132
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
(Don't stop.)

133
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,820
(Tiptoeing)

134
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,820
- Come on.
- That's it.

135
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,720
(Joon's near the watermelons.)

136
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,160
I'm sorry, kid,

137
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,190
but we're extra strict with kids.

138
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,560
Keep that in mind.

139
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,730
We don't let kids off lightly.

140
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,100
He sets off
the moment you pick one up.

141
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,900
You can do it, kid. Stay strong!

142
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,070
(It's a feint.)

143
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,210
He's faking you with his moves.

144
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,380
That doesn't work on us.

145
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,110
He's done his research.

146
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,950
(Hesitating)

147
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,520
I can't do this, teacher.

148
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,420
No, you can do it.

149
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,590
My heart might stop.

150
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,990
- No.
- No, you can do it.

151
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,820
You can do it. One, two, three, go!

152
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,830
(Patting him on the back)

153
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,060
It's really too...
My chest hurts too much.

154
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,360
No, you can do it.

155
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,370
He got it!

156
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,640
(His chest pains...)

157
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,210
(were fake)

158
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,180
(Running at full speed)

159
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,280
(A successful steal?)

160
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,650
No, you can do it.

161
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,920
(Running)

162
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,950
He got it!

163
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,990
President!

164
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,060
(I got you.)

165
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,560
You did it!

166
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,090
(No way.)

167
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,630
I got him!

168
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,530
-I got him!
- Well done.

169
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,930
Why did you run so hard?

170
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,830
- He's really fast.
- We told you.

171
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,070
We don't let kids off lightly.

172
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,470
- He ran for his life.
- He's so fast.

173
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,440
Toward the end...

174
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,810
(A fantastic final spurt)

175
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,940
Baby, are you crying?

176
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,510
- He's crying.
- Oh, no.

177
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,210
Let's wipe your tears.

178
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,480
Give this back, darling.

179
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,920
Where are you going?

180
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,890
Come here with me.

181
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,420
- Why...
- I don't like this.

182
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,120
- Oh, dear.
- This is your seat.

183
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Oh, please.

184
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,390
Let's begin.

185
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,430
Here we go.

186
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,490
(Got you.)

187
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,660
That's it!

188
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,370
Hold your head up, kid.
There you go.

189
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,400
That's it.

190
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,400
Look straight ahead.

191
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,740
Look...

192
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,670
- No, wait. Sir!
- Sir!

193
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,080
This dad is a strict one.
He's teaching his son strictly.

194
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,350
He is. Oh, no. Not again.

195
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,580
He pressed the button again.

196
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,680
That's a lot of water.

197
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,180
DinDin turned it back on.

198
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,190
- You step on it to make it work?
- Yes.

199
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,690
(Giggling)

200
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,960
All right, son. How was it?
Are you okay?

201
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,060
He's not okay. Or are you okay?

202
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,030
(He learns the lesson
not to steal watermelons firsthand.)

203
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,970
- Who bullied my brother?
- Let's do this.

204
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,370
I'm sorry. I didn't get that.

205
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,270
- What did you say?
- Who bullied my brother?

206
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,940
"Who bullied my brother?"

207
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,040
It was this guy here.
What are you going to do?

208
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,780
- You...
- It wasn't us. It was him.

209
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,380
- You just wait, mister.
- What? Let's go.

210
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,250
(Eldest Daughter Yoo Seon Ho
of the Watermelon Thief Family)

211
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,510
(Also known as the Paper Doll,
Hobby: Running)

212
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,720
(But she may fall down
while running.)

213
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,820
- Great. One.
- Come in when you're ready,

214
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,120
- Princess.
- You got this.

215
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,490
Let's do this.

216
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,920
Come on in, Princess.

217
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,830
She's coming in,
but she looks more like a prince.

218
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,930
Right.

219
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,400
Rumor has it that she's not looking
for her knight in shining armor,

220
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,500
but rather, she's looking
for the shining armor for herself.

221
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,130
That's why she's trying
to steal the watermelon.

222
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,100
- Who...
- Here's the shining armor you want.

223
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,910
- Don't look at me.
- No.

224
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,470
Who would look away from a thief?

225
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,580
I must keep an eye on you.

226
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,010
What's that over there?

227
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,580
- My gosh.
- Hey!

228
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,710
What's that over there?

229
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,120
(He steals the watermelon quickly.)

230
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,350
What's that over there?

231
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,720
- My gosh.
- Hey! He's fast!

232
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,350
He's getting away!

233
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,360
(He's way too fast to be stopped.)

234
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,930
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

235
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,860
Oh, my.

236
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,030
(He easily steals the watermelon.)

237
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,700
- You had a good strategy.
- Gosh, it worked.

238
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,100
- Who's next?
- It worked.

239
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,600
- Well done.
- I didn't know it'd work.

240
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
- Well done.
- It's all right.

241
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,540
- We can do this.
- You still did well.

242
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,510
Who drew Passionate Farmer?

243
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,040
- It's the kid...
- Hold on.

244
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,280
- and his grandma.
- The kid and the granny drew me.

245
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,510
(Grandma Kim Jong Min
of the Watermelon Thief Family)

246
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,820
(She will soon turn 50 years old,
so she has frozen shoulders.)

247
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,080
(Her faking level is
at the highest.)

248
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,020
Age has no place
when catching the watermelon thief.

249
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,720
That's right.

250
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,120
- She's going to stay professional.
- She's a good worker.

251
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,520
- Yes.
- She's going to stay professional.

252
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,530
Okay.

253
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,090
Come on in when you're ready.

254
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,100
(I'll show you what old age can do.)

255
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,140
If you run this hard while entering,
how will you run away?

256
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,000
(Check out my faking skill.)

257
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,270
Oh, no. I forgot the watermelon.

258
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,970
This old lady seems full of energy.

259
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,280
(Faking it 2 times in a row)

260
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,680
- She keeps faking it.
- I should grab it.

261
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,410
(Should I steal the watermelon
or not?)

262
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,550
Should she do it or not?

263
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,650
- Should I take it?
- Yes.

264
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,020
All right. Stay seated.

265
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,020
(She can't think straight.)

266
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,390
- What an excellent skill.
- That's a great skill.

267
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,660
(Grandma Jong Min's stealing trick
is on another level.)

268
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,190
- What is it going to be?
- Oh, no.

269
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,660
(Grandma Jong Min executes
many tricks to distract her.)

270
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,890
You must stay seated.

271
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,960
Where are you going?

272
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,930
It looks like this old lady had
a few drinks.

273
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,600
(The second lesson)

274
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,530
(Roar in unintelligible words.)

275
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,000
Mom, make sure
to divide your energy wisely.

276
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,140
- Your lips are already pale.
- My gosh.

277
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,170
Could you talk to each other?

278
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,840
Us?
Why don't you sit down over there?

279
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,340
Are you feeling all right?

280
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,210
(She pushes ahead
with the momentum.)

281
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,050
You're scaring me.

282
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,420
It looks like
this isn't her first rodeo.

283
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,120
This old lady
is showing her family...

284
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,360
how to tease her
with the watermelon.

285
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,460
But now...

286
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,930
- What?
- Gosh.

287
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,160
But now...

288
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,930
(After building up the suspense
for a long time,)

289
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,630
(he spots his chance
and tries to steal the watermelon.)

290
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,740
- There he goes.
- He won.

291
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,740
(An incredible speed)

292
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,910
(She learned her lesson
after underestimating the granny.)

293
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,580
(She's the best!)

294
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,640
My gosh.

295
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,710
The old lady's still got it.

296
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,720
- The old lady's still got it.
- My gosh.

297
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,320
- That was so hard.
- Nicely done.

298
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,790
- Let's get this over with.
- Great.

299
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,790
Who's next? Come on in.

300
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,420
(Next thief, come on in.)

301
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,090
Next up is the youngest kid.

302
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,330
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

303
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,060
(Older Twin Cho Sae Ho
of the Watermelon Thief Family)

304
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,560
(He just turned one year old,
but talks too much.)

305
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,970
(He gets overly immersed in things.)

306
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,000
Go!

307
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
- Hold on.
- Gosh.

308
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,700
He's acting right now.
What's going on?

309
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,910
(The thief shows up after getting
a whiff of watermelons.)

310
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,680
(Overly immersed in his role)

311
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,810
(Looking around)

312
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,850
What is it?

313
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,320
(He spots the watermelon.)

314
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,450
- He saw the watermelon.
- He found the watermelon.

315
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,550
He spotted it.

316
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,790
(It's a watermelon!)

317
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,620
(No one is watching, right?)

318
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,530
(One-Year-Old Baby Sae Ho
was a pantomime prodigy.)

319
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,560
(You got this, brother.)

320
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,370
(Sae Ho is already
in front of the watermelon.)

321
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,140
(Screaming)

322
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,740
Right.

323
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,270
(He spots a resident
who's guarding the watermelon.)

324
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,810
He found the farmer
who was guarding the watermelon!

325
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,840
He saw her.

326
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,710
What's he doing?

327
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,580
(Attacking her with his dance)

328
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,880
(Shocked)

329
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,950
What's he doing?

330
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,180
(He's also shocked.)

331
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,020
(The kind farmer is trying her best
to play along.)

332
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,060
(He breaks down her mentally
with his awful dance.)

333
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,860
(He approaches the watermelon
while she's distracted.)

334
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,560
(Should I steal it or not?)

335
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,500
He's doing exactly
what his grandma did.

336
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,830
If you need to pee,
why don't you use the toilet there?

337
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,270
You can use the toilet
and come back...

338
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,840
- He got it!
- He stole it!

339
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,070
(After demonstrating
a flashy upper body trick,)

340
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,510
(he sees a chance
and steals the watermelon.)

341
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,540
That was fast.

342
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,510
- He got it!
- He stole it!

343
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,950
That was fast.

344
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,480
(Passionate Farmer's legs
go weak...)

345
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,950
(from watching the dance
a moment ago.)

346
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,320
(Clueless of that,
he runs as fast as he can.)

347
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,220
- He got it!
- He stole it!

348
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,560
- That was fast.
- Go!

349
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,160
(He easily steals the watermelon.)

350
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,760
(Booing)

351
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
(It's fine as long as he wins.)

352
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,840
- That was a low blow!
- That was a low blow.

353
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,400
Come on.

354
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,240
(He celebrates by dancing
even more cruelly.)

355
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,580
Look at him all excited.
He won the round by...

356
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,810
(Let me join you.)

357
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,610
(Me too.)

358
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,650
My gosh.

359
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,110
(The thieves are pleased
with their consecutive successes.)

360
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,480
- Youth President.
- Yes?

361
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,820
- We can't let this fly.
- We can't.

362
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,120
- That family is looking down on us.
- Yes.

363
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,990
And they're using
all kinds of dirty tricks.

364
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,860
From now on,
I won't try to be funny.

365
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,560
- I'll take it seriously.
- Take it seriously.

366
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,160
- I'll take it seriously.
- Why is he taking it seriously now?

367
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,390
- Take it seriously.
- I'll take it seriously.

368
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,730
By the way,
Su-niper seems way too intense.

369
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,430
- I think he's the best of them.
- Right.

370
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,700
It looks like
it will be tough to beat him.

371
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,300
I can tell he was on the track team.

372
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,840
(The next thief is Mother Moon.)

373
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,170
- It's the mother.
- Yes.

374
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,080
- Looking at her build,
- Yes?

375
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,010
this small watermelon
won't be enough for her.

376
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,980
So we prepared a watermelon
of a special size for her.

377
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,180
We heard you were coming,
so we got this yesterday.

378
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,820
- You...
- We quickly got this. Yes.

379
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,190
(Laughing)

380
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,590
- You...
- We quickly got this.

381
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,960
After some kind
of fermentation process,

382
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,390
- we managed to puff it up.
- Yes.

383
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,300
You can just grab this watermelon.

384
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,400
(Okay.)

385
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,570
Gosh, that looks tasty.
Let's eat it together.

386
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,440
- Ma'am, are you ready?
- Yes.

387
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,740
Great.

388
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,040
This handsome guy here
will try to catch you.

389
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,840
So good luck running away from him.

390
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,380
(Mother Moon Se Yoon
of the Watermelon Thief Family)

391
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,780
(She's indeed a mother
and the strongest family member.)

392
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,180
(She may be quite fast.)

393
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,050
Ma'am, come on in when you're ready.

394
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,450
Okay.

395
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,650
- Great.
- What's going on?

396
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,690
What's going on?

397
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,190
(Is she putting down
a mini watermelon?)

398
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
(One, two...)

399
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,290
- Get her.
- Hold on.

400
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,590
- Hold on, ma'am.
- Ma'am.

401
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,890
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

402
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,860
(Startled)

403
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,200
- What was that?
- Okay. I got it.

404
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,870
- My mom was practicing.
- I was just practicing.

405
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay. I see.

406
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,200
I see.
She's going to steal the watermelon.

407
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,700
If he gets near her,
she will smash him.

408
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,140
(Smashing)

409
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,280
That lady seems quite strong.

410
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,680
Su-niper, will you be okay?

411
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,180
My gosh, she...

412
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,250
(Polite)

413
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,250
(Punching at full power)

414
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,590
My gosh,
she must have been working out.

415
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,620
That explains
why her kids ended up like that.

416
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,790
(Mother Moon's love goes straight
to the solar plexus and chin.)

417
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,960
Ma'am.

418
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,890
(Her children's growth status
finally makes sense.)

419
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,030
Hold on. This is scary.

420
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,500
But could she put it in her bucket?
Okay.

421
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
(Mother Moon approaches
in a threatening manner.)

422
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,570
Hey, Su-niper.

423
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,700
(Looking away)

424
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,740
Hey.

425
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,470
What is it?

426
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,270
(Se Yoon is right
in front of the watermelon.)

427
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,540
- What's she doing?
- She's setting up an obstacle.

428
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,180
- That's an obstacle?
- Yes, it is.

429
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,810
Why are you using my hat?
Who do you think you are?

430
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,750
Well, ma'am.

431
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,350
You can't use other people's stuff.

432
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,450
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

433
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,490
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am.

434
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,360
This is our pineapple...

435
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,660
- Ma'am!
- Hey!

436
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,060
This is our pineapple...

437
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,430
(She steals the huge watermelon
rather quickly with her hands.)

438
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,470
(Running while grimacing)

439
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,140
(Su-niper is chasing after her
right away.)

440
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,240
(Will Se Yoon create a miracle?)

441
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,880
- Ma'am!
- Hey!

442
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,480
(I got you, thief!)

443
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,820
(She tries her best to run
as fast as possible.)

444
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,520
Hello, ma'am.

445
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,220
(Swinging)

446
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,990
(I dodged it.)

447
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,690
(Su-niper dodges
her punches quickly.)

448
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,630
- Okay. Good job dodging that.
- My gosh.

449
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,500
- Did he catch me?
- He did.

450
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,530
Gosh, you caught me.

451
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,300
Come this way, ma'am.

452
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,270
None of the tricks
I prepared worked.

453
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,070
Se Yoon, he was jogging behind you.

454
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,140
I thought I was pretty fast.

455
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,840
- He jogged, but still caught you.
- Really?

456
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,870
He only jogged.

457
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,810
(He reacted instantly.)

458
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,840
This is our pineapple...

459
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:12,450
(Then he easily matched
his speed to the thief's.)

460
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,090
Make sure it doesn't collapse.
Please do a good job.

461
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,820
Son, come and join me.

462
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,060
Why must I?

463
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,230
- Son, join me.
- Son, sit on your mother's lap.

464
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,360
- Gosh, you must be scared.
- He's going to sit on her lap?

465
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,000
All right.
The mother and the son must be hot.

466
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,470
(Leaning back)

467
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,570
My gosh. The mother and the son
get along very well.

468
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,440
(Mom, save me.)

469
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,080
Is he laughing or crying?

470
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,820
(Thanks to his mother,
he's experiencing a new world.)

471
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,850
- My gosh.
- Nice.

472
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,220
That was nice and cool.

473
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,120
My son.

474
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,790
- Was it cool?
- Great. I'm clean now.

475
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,560
- Was it cool?
- Yes, it was.

476
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,860
- This is the last one.
- Yes, it's the father.

477
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,900
The father seems very athletic.

478
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,530
- So I set up an obstacle.
- Yes.

479
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,530
- Sure.
- Okay.

480
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,730
Sir.

481
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,970
- We want to win the last round.
- Okay.

482
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,510
Looking back,
this family played dirtier than us.

483
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,510
- Right.
- Yes.

484
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,640
- We're the victims here.
- Yes.

485
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,810
Let's have the thrill
of winning the last one.

486
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,810
- Okay.
- Let's do it.
(We won't go easy on the last one.)

487
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,320
(Father DinDin
of the Watermelon Thief Family)

488
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,720
(The king of tricks, known as Flash)

489
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,980
(He's been training by running.)

490
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,750
Sir, are you ready?

491
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,290
Great.

492
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,890
- Sir.
- He runs a lot these days.

493
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,920
- DinDin.
- Go.

494
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,930
(Father Din begins.)

495
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,230
(He leisurely heads over
while stretching.)

496
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,070
- Hey, go and win this.
- Please.

497
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,830
- He's been running a lot.
- Honey.

498
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,140
Honey, go and get my watermelon.

499
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,770
- He's in a running crew.
- Okay?

500
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,040
- Honey. My gosh.
- Come on.

501
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,640
- Honey. My gosh.
- Come on.

502
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,840
You got this!

503
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,110
- What a great pair they are.
- Good luck.

504
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,250
Did they place it there on purpose?

505
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,820
(Making it stand upright)

506
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,980
So that's what you'll do?

507
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,590
(He easily jumps over it.)

508
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,720
Su-niper,
do you think you can do it?

509
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,550
You're not going to lose, right?

510
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,490
You're not going to lose
because of that, right?

511
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,530
Honey, don't worry about it.

512
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,860
- My gosh.
- Two?

513
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,290
He must be
on a track and field team...

514
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,330
like those athletes...

515
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,530
- who jump over hurdles.
- Right.

516
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,870
- What's going on?
- You need more?

517
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,800
- What is this?
- Sure.

518
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,140
- My gosh.
- Oh, no! There he goes!

519
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
(He starts running
as soon as he throws the obstacle.)

520
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,570
There he goes!

521
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,810
- My gosh.
- Oh, no!

522
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,110
(Both of them are incredibly fast.)

523
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,550
- Oh, my.
- There he goes!

524
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,310
(DinDin is running at full speed.)

525
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,320
DinDin!

526
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,820
My gosh.

527
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,650
(Su-niper is
frantically chasing DinDin.)

528
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,430
(What's the result?)

529
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,060
- My gosh.
- Oh, no!

530
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,160
- Oh, my.
- There he goes!

531
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,300
My gosh.

532
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,660
- He got DinDin.
- What happened?

533
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,900
- Did Su-niper get him?
- Did he?

534
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,570
(There were obstacles
in front of him.)

535
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,070
(Jumping)

536
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,710
(He ran furiously
as if his feet were engine-powered.)

537
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,340
(And he barely managed
to tap DinDin.)

538
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,450
- Oh, my.
- There he goes!

539
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,610
(Screaming)

540
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,980
What happened?

541
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,220
- Did Su-niper get him?
- Did he?

542
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,580
- I got him.
- You got him!

543
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,950
- I got him.
- Nice!

544
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,190
(Disappointed)

545
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,690
Gosh, he managed to catch DinDin.
He's so fast.

546
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,260
- He's really fast.
- That guy is super fast.

547
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,960
- That guy is fast.
- Oh, my. He's fast.

548
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,460
Well, DinDin was fast too.

549
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
- He's a fast runner too.
- Darn it.

550
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,900
DinDin was fast too.

551
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,800
How dare you beat my husband?

552
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,370
How dare you beat my husband?

553
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,800
(Running away)

554
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,110
(Out of the blue, he gets splashed.)

555
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,210
How dare you?

556
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,740
(Honey?)

557
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,250
- Honey.
- It was me!

558
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,680
It was you? My gosh. Honey.

559
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,850
(Oh, no. I got the wrong guy.)

560
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,020
All right. Go and sit...

561
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,180
- on the penalty chair.
- Go ahead.

562
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,790
Dad!

563
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,720
Why don't you join your dad?

564
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,590
- The youngest son.
- The youngest son should join.

565
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,590
- I'm good.
- Go ahead.

566
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,630
- You should join him.
- Go up there.

567
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,390
- Come here, my youngest.
- Let's go.

568
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,160
- You must join your dad.
- Come here.

569
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,260
- Sit on his lap.
- My youngest son.

570
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,430
- Come here.
- How come...

571
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,530
the youngest son is taller?

572
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,530
- All right.
- Dad.

573
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,170
- One, two, three.
- Dad.

574
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,340
- No.
- Dad!

575
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,870
Come on.

576
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,310
(Fixing his head
so he can't dodge the water)

577
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,850
He can't breathe right now.

578
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,710
(Gasping for air)

579
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,150
Go ahead.
Why don't you join your dad?

580
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,590
All right.
His daughter should join him too.

581
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,250
- Say, "I love you, Dad."
- My gosh.

582
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,690
What a loving bond
between the father and the daughter.

583
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,930
My gosh. Say, "I love you."

584
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,090
- My gosh, the father...
- Grandma.

585
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,930
- Mother should join him.
- My gosh.

586
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,230
My gosh, ma'am!

587
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,330
(Grandma Jong Min
will join him too.)

588
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,100
My gosh. The grandma
will join him too. She's brave!

589
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,140
Oh, my.

590
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,670
(He keeps the back
of his mom's neck fixed,)

591
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,510
(so she gets most of the water.)

592
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,910
My gosh.

593
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,110
(He fulfills
the duty of an unfilial son.)

594
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,680
- Everyone.
- My gosh.

595
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,950
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

596
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,250
(Father Din got 3 water bombs
in a row.)

597
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,980
- Are you okay? Gosh, that was good.
- My goodness.

598
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,480
They must be soaked.

599
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,720
Jong Min, Sae Ho, and Seon Ho...

600
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,920
won the watermelon hwachae.

601
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,120
- Okay.
- Okay.

602
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,290
- Let's thank our helpers today.
- My gosh.

603
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,760
- Thank you.
- Good job.

604
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,930
- Good job.
- Good work.

605
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,100
- Thank you.
- You were great.

606
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,100
- Gosh. Great job.
- Thank you.

607
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,000
(The family and the guards
are on good terms now.)

608
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,310
(Now that they're done
stealing watermelons,)

609
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,870
(they'll go and have some hwachae.)

610
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,080
Gosh, I really thought I had it.

611
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,510
You can make it look close
with some editing, right?

612
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,750
It won't be easy, though.

613
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,750
(He's honest.)

614
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,780
- What?
- My gosh.

615
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,150
- That's real watermelon hwachae.
- Grab it and eat it here.

616
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,150
I thought they'd give it to us
in a big bowl to share.

617
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,720
- Watermelon in strawberry milk?
- Thank you.

618
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,160
- That's still better than nothing.
- Thank you.

619
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,390
That looks so refreshing.

620
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,920
- It must be refreshing.
- It looks good.

621
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,160
(The watermelon hwachae
will surely chase away the heat.)

622
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,630
Hey. It does look good, though.

623
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,330
- It's milk.
- Strawberry milk.

624
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,730
Yes!

625
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,670
- Gosh, this is good.
- This?

626
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,800
Let me taste it.

627
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,340
- What is it? Did they add Sprite?
- They added Sprite.

628
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,940
- It's so good.
- Is it strawberry milk?

629
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,080
- It's Sprite.
- Sprite.

630
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,240
They mixed Sprite and milk.

631
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,310
- Just regular milk?
- It's sweet and refreshing.

632
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,080
- Gosh, it's so sweet.
- My gosh. This is so sweet.

633
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,450
Did they add sugar?

634
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,360
This hits the spot.

635
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,830
Gosh, it's so refreshing.

636
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,360
(The 3 of them are enjoying
the hwachae to the fullest.)

637
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,030
(Envious)

638
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,260
- Right?
- It's so sweet.

639
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,770
- Give some to the cat.
- What?

640
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,870
(A cat came over
after smelling something sweet.)

641
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,000
- The cat is asking for some.
- Meow.

642
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,470
But we have nothing to offer.
Do you eat watermelons too?

643
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,140
(Bummed out)

644
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,340
You all enjoyed the hwachae, right?

645
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,750
- Let's go to the base camp now.
- Really? Okay.

646
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,910
(They head out to the base camp
after enjoying the hwachae.)

647
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,810
By the way,
we're on Grab and Kill Tour.

648
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,220
What did we exactly grab today?

649
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,350
- Did we grab some laughter?
- Laughter?

650
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,220
I laughed so hard
when Sae Ho skydived.

651
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,560
(There he is,
our laughter generator.)

652
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Thank you.

653
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,870
- When Sae Ho skydived?
- Right.

654
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,130
What happened to your goggles
was funny too.

655
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,600
- They got pushed up.
- They went up.

656
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,300
I couldn't open my eyes.

657
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,940
I was afraid my eyes would be
damaged if I opened them.

658
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,710
Did we grab the back of our neck
from frustration?

659
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,110
- We definitely did.
- We grabbed our neck.

660
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,210
We did grab the back of our neck
after the amusement ride.

661
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,350
- Right. We did.
- Yes.

662
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,380
(It'd be a relief...)

663
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,650
(if the back of their neck
was the only thing they grabbed.)

664
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,390
I grabbed your hand a lot, Jong Min.

665
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,450
- I see. Right. We held hands.
- We kept holding hands.

666
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,860
Yes. We grabbed the watermelon
and so on.

667
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,630
We grabbed touching moments too.

668
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,160
- When did that happen?
- Touching moments?

669
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,560
When did that happen?

670
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,930
(Touching moments?)

671
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,370
Personally, I was touched...

672
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,730
You guys...

673
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,970
(Thinking hard)

674
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,000
Hold on.

675
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,170
(Laughing)

676
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,240
"Hold on."

677
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,170
- As for touching moments...
- Let's think a bit more.

678
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,610
Okay. Let me think about them
a little more.

679
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,440
Then let's grab ourselves
some touching moments later.

680
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,450
(As they drive on,
wondering about...)

681
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,450
(what kind of touching moment
to grab...)

682
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,950
- We're at the KBS building.
- There's a KBS building here?

683
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,990
They film dramas here.

684
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,920
It's been a while.

685
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,620
Gosh, it's so cool inside.

686
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,830
Look at the room. Nice.

687
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,430
Can you give it to me?

688
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,330
- Joon, do you want a pillow?
- No, I'm good.

689
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,060
- Take one.
- No, I'm good.

690
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,930
- My gosh.
- No.

691
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,930
(I want a pillow too.)

692
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,570
(Throwing him down)

693
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,240
That guy, Su-niper, was fast.

694
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,410
- He was fast.
- Su-niper.

695
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,640
- He was so fast.
- He was incredibly fast.

696
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,710
- Gosh.
- He was fast.

697
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,340
What about me?
Was my round a close one?

698
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,280
You were fast too.

699
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,610
- Was I fast like him?
- Yes.

700
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,510
During your round,
she lost her will to try.

701
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,780
That was because
I flustered her with my dance.

702
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,920
(It's understandable.)

703
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,420
Se Yoon, it was your first time
on the roller coaster, right?

704
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,590
- Yes. I told my son about it.
- How was it?

705
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,730
How was it today?

706
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,760
- It was good. Quite good, actually.
- I see.

707
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,960
- Did you tell your son?
- What did you tell him?

708
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,530
You know what it was like?

709
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,770
Say that
you can't eat fermented skate.

710
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,970
But all of a sudden,
you try it and think,

711
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:17,970
- Yes.
- "This isn't bad."

712
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,370
Say that you can't half-dried saury.
"It's fishy."

713
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,870
(It's the feeling of liking food
you couldn't stand before.)

714
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,770
"This is good." That's how it felt.

715
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,010
(Se Yoon got a taste
of amusement rides.)

716
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,540
- "This is pretty good."
- Really?

717
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,910
"This is doable."
I had my eyes open for a long time.

718
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,310
I wanted to open my eyes
when it dropped.

719
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,680
- Did you open your eyes?
- I did.

720
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,390
I trusted that nothing would happen
during the fall.

721
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,250
So I held onto the safety bar.

722
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,320
- It was fastened.
- Here's an example.

723
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,290
The biggest...

724
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,630
(When everyone is taking a break,
he looked up roller coasters.)

725
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,260
Gosh, this one looks scary.

726
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,960
(Gasping)

727
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,930
It must feel like they're flying
forward in the beginning.

728
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,970
Se Yoon is interested in
amusement rides now.

729
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:52,970
(It's as if he's in love.)

730
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,170
Take your kids there.
I'm sure they'll like it.

731
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,170
(Looking forward to the day
he can ride it with his family)

732
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,240
You can ride it too
because I got on it today, my son.

733
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,010
It's true.

734
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,250
(After the break,)

735
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,950
(the sky has gotten dark
in no time.)

736
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,320
- What?
- What is this?

737
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,590
What's going on?

738
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,290
(Amazed)

739
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,490
- My gosh, what is this?
- What?

740
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,660
(What's in front of
the hungry members?)

741
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,230
It's a buffet spread.

742
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,090
- Can we eat?
- Of course not!

743
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,760
Spaghetti.
This is Se Yoon's favorite.

744
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,430
Gosh, look at this.

745
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,430
- Se Yoon.
- Gosh.

746
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,500
Your favorite, kimchi stew.

747
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,240
- What is this?
- It's your favorite.

748
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,040
- From the food truck. Kimchi stew!
- My gosh.

749
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,370
- You're torturing us.
- Hey, there's galbi.

750
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,710
My gosh. I want some spaghetti.

751
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,080
- Hey, the chicken looks amazing.
- Gosh, what a feast.

752
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,250
- What's all this?
- Look at this.

753
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,150
Hey, it's a first birthday party.

754
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,520
- Our first birthday party.
- It's a feast.

755
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,620
The chef from the food truck
prepared a special meal.

756
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,620
(The first birthday meal
prepared by the food truck chef)

757
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,590
I see fried chicken,
sweet and spicy chicken, and galbi.

758
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,630
This is crazy.

759
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,930
(Starting with Korean beef galbi,
the spread includes...)

760
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,630
(seasoned water parsley
with vinegar,)

761
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,100
(seafood balls,)

762
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,500
(and spaghetti.)

763
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,930
We just got the fried chicken...

764
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,100
- from 1 of the 3 major...
- Really?

765
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,700
fried chicken restaurants in Suwon.

766
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,340
Like the galbi fried chicken
from Suwon.

767
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,400
We also have
the three-tier baekseolgi cake...

768
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,470
we custom-ordered.

769
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,670
- That's everything now.
- That's the carb portion.

770
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,510
We prepared a buffet spread
for the first birthday party.

771
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,580
- You like it, right?
- Yes.

772
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,880
- Of course.
- We love it.

773
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,980
If you taste it...

774
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,850
- What?
- Should we taste some?

775
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,580
- I see.
- Okay.

776
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,590
What shall we do?

777
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,050
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- To boost energy,

778
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,290
- play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

779
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,060
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

780
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,290
Okay.

781
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,360
(Who will get the chance
to take a bite?)

782
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,900
- Okay.
- Okay.

783
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,770
How about a loser?

784
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,970
- This time, it's the loser.
- The loser.

785
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,900
- Pick one more person.
- The one who loses.

786
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,870
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

787
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,470
(Se Yoon also gets a chance
to take a bite.)

788
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,440
- First, I'll have some galbi.
- Okay.

789
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,440
Is this crunchy fried chicken?

790
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,250
This is crunchy fried chicken
with bones.

791
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,480
I'm so jealous.

792
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
(They can't take their eyes off it.)

793
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,420
- Let's go.
- One, two, three.

794
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,250
(Taking a full bite)

795
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,160
(The texture of galbi
spreads over the palate.)

796
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,460
(Se Yoon who chose
crunchy fried chicken)

797
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,230
- He can fit a lot in his mouth.
- It's good.

798
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,870
It's so delicious.

799
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,700
We heard you. We can tell
that it's good, so let's move on.

800
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,340
- Let's hurry up and play.
- Let's go.

801
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,040
What kind of crunchy fried food
is this?

802
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,610
- Is it mushroom?
- It must be delicious.

803
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,440
Did you eat mushroom?

804
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,540
(It's mushroom, not chicken.)

805
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,710
- Is it mushroom?
- The galbi is good.

806
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,840
It's actually mushroom.

807
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,080
Did he eat three pieces of mushroom?

808
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,080
(Laughing)

809
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,350
- You said it was chicken.
- He had three pieces of mushroom.

810
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,620
The sauce was still amazing.

811
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,990
With your first birthday feast
at stake,

812
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,360
your Dinner Game will be...

813
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,330
- What is it?
- Nothing to Eat...

814
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,930
- at a Famous First Birthday Party.
- What?

815
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,730
- But there's a lot of food.
- The title shouldn't be...

816
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,800
so ominous.

817
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
All right.

818
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,730
If you clear the relay
of missions in order,

819
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,600
you'll get to enjoy...

820
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,240
the birthday feast
as much as you want.

821
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,040
- Every time you fail a mission,
- Aren't you worried?

822
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,910
more people will hear
about this party.

823
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,910
Who?

824
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,580
Once they hear about it,
they will arrive...

825
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,050
and enjoy the feast.

826
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,850
Before they finish the food,

827
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,620
- you must succeed.
- Gosh.

828
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,050
How many guests will come...

829
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,120
every time we fail?

830
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,290
More guests will join,
little by little.

831
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,720
(Food for 20 people is prepared.
More guests will join.)

832
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,860
Just do your best on your mission.

833
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,290
The first mission is...

834
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,160
- jump rope.
- I can do it all night.

835
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,300
You must continue the jump rope...

836
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,530
until all the members
clear their missions.

837
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,230
If you trip on the rope before then,
it'll be a failure.

838
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,630
- Even if only one person remains?
- That's the worst.

839
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,040
I'll do it. I'm good at it.

840
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,240
The second mission is
blowing out the candles.

841
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,680
- With what?
- Put a stocking over your face...

842
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,140
and blow out the three candles.

843
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,540
I can do this one.

844
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,850
This is difficult.
Someone strong should do it.

845
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,850
I can do it.

846
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,910
For the third mission,

847
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,220
shout, "Congratulations
on your first birthday."

848
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,820
You have to undo all the buttons
in one go to succeed.

849
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,350
This is for Joon.

850
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,420
Hey, Joon. You're good at this.

851
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,460
That's right.

852
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,060
The fourth mission is...

853
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,890
- toasting.
- Toasting?

854
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,630
It's either vinegar or juice.

855
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,860
- This is for Jong Min.
- Jong Min.

856
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,430
To succeed, you have to pick...

857
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,770
apple juice
and drink it all in one go.

858
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,540
- What if you fail?
- Then you must start again.

859
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,300
- It's a fail?
- Yes.

860
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,340
The fifth mission is...

861
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,610
- doljabi.
- What?

862
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,940
Wooden chopsticks are tied
to the end of a string.

863
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,550
You have to break them
with your bottoms.

864
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,980
I'll do this one.

865
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,280
I'm usually good at this.

866
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,980
- You can do it with your bottoms?
- I used to be good at it.

867
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,020
This one is for you.

868
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,050
- The sixth mission is...
- Don't you pull that out?

869
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,250
cleaning up the feast.

870
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,290
You must remove the tablecloth...

871
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,820
- in one go to succeed.
- You're good at this.

872
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,630
If you don't succeed in one go,
you fail.

873
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,200
Everyone, it's not over yet.

874
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,500
And? It's not over?

875
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,600
Isn't that it?

876
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,370
- After clearing the sixth mission,
- That's him.

877
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
all the members will jump rope
in a group.

878
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
This is the worst.

879
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,810
- I'm nervous.
- We're doomed for the jump rope.

880
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,340
Everyone, please set it up.

881
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,080
This may sound ominous,

882
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,110
but we might succeed
on our first try.

883
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,350
If you do,
we'll give you credit for it.

884
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,250
- It doesn't have to be fun, right?
- Okay.

885
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,750
- Watching you do it once is fun.
- Really?

886
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,350
Sae Ho, watch carefully.

887
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,030
(Number 1 player
with amazing jumping skills)

888
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,390
Hey, this is easy enough.

889
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,800
You have to stretch out your arms.

890
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,230
If I grab the top, I won't undo
the buttons at the bottom.

891
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,070
We can do it!

892
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,640
Let's go!

893
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,410
Let's get started!

894
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,140
- Let's go.
- This is your first try.

895
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,110
Get ready, set...

896
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,150
Why is it so slow?

897
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,490
(Seon Ho must continue
until everyone clears the mission.)

898
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,750
All right, start.

899
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,090
(Number 2, Se Yoon, starts.)

900
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,830
(A candle thief appears
at the birthday party.)

901
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,930
He didn't make it.

902
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,600
- Okay.
- He blew them out.

903
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,300
- Go.
- Se Yoon succeeded.

904
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,100
Congratulations
on your first birthday!

905
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,200
- Did he make it?
- Joon succeeded.

906
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
(Congratulations
on your first birthday!)

907
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,610
(As expected, he knows
how to tear a shirt.)

908
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,040
(Clearing the 3rd mission
in no time)

909
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Okay.

910
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,610
(This is killing me.)

911
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,150
(Toasting with
1 out of 3 chance to win)

912
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,780
Please.

913
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,650
(Drinking up)

914
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,920
Please... He's got it.

915
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,120
- What?
- Okay.

916
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,460
- Gosh.
- I'll go. It's a stethoscope.

917
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,630
- Okay.
- Okay.

918
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,700
(The number of wooden chopsticks
at the end is important.)

919
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,660
- How many are there?
- How many do you have?

920
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,800
Seon Ho, hang in there.
We're almost done.

921
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,970
(Five pairs,
which is relatively small)

922
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,500
Please let us have some good food.

923
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,010
Let's enjoy the birthday party.

924
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,310
- Okay.
- He got it.

925
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,770
Let's enjoy the birthday party.

926
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,610
(He breaks them easily.)

927
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,210
- I got it.
- He got it.

928
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,580
(The sixth player, DinDin, begins.)

929
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,750
Hey, you can do it. Stay calm.

930
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,180
- Our lives are at stake.
- Pull it out fast.

931
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,350
Do it fast.

932
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,150
(Collapsing)

933
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,260
(Their world also comes
crashing down.)

934
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,360
Your first try failed.

935
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,960
- We were so close.
- Oh, no.

936
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,430
(The ultimate traitor)

937
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,230
Everyone,
there's a birthday party over here.

938
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,600
By the way...

939
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,800
What's going on?

940
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,670
- Are they our managers?
- Chan Song, eat only a little.

941
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,640
(The first group of guests
is their managers.)

942
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,740
- Chan Song doesn't eat a lot.
- Right.

943
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,080
You guys usually don't eat much.

944
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,380
- My manager eats a lot more.
- I'll serve you.

945
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,780
Jong Hyun, he's asking
if he can eat only tomatoes.

946
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,420
- Do you only want some tomatoes?
- I always bump...

947
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,790
into Joon's manager at the gym.

948
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,490
He served himself too much rice.

949
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,720
He eats a lot of food.

950
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,690
- He served himself so much rice.
- He eats at least two bowls.

951
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,730
- Really?
- Yes.

952
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,760
We don't have time for this.
Let's start again.

953
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,370
Let's hurry up.

954
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,370
I just succeeded.

955
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,070
Take your time to eat.

956
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,770
Eat slowly.

957
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,010
Don't pull it down too low.

958
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,110
What are you doing?

959
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,080
It should be here at least.

960
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,080
(He's trying to lower
the tablecloth.)

961
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,180
Was the tablecloth
at the edge originally?

962
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,310
What?

963
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,580
- I aligned the tablecloth.
- He finished setting it up.

964
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,450
Put the objects in the middle.

965
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,060
The tablecloth should cover
the front like before.

966
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Let's go.

967
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,590
Everyone, are you ready?

968
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,390
Seon Ho, stay strong.

969
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,700
You can do it.

970
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,500
Tell me once you succeed.

971
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,800
- Okay.
- I keep wanting to look.

972
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,200
Here's your second try.

973
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,640
- Get ready.
- Five times?

974
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,740
We can do this.

975
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,040
Let's show them our competence.

976
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,070
Set.

977
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,080
(Their 2nd try starts.)

978
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,410
Start.

979
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,380
Let's go, Sae Ho. That's good.

980
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,520
(Put on the stocking
and blow out the candles)

981
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,920
Seon Ho, save your energy.

982
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,360
(Blowing)

983
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,630
(His lung capacity has
decreased a lot.)

984
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,130
Se Yoon, step forward.

985
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,670
Se Yoon, step forward.

986
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,640
Se Yoon succeeded.

987
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,200
Congratulations
on your first birthday!

988
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,840
- He got it.
- Joon succeeded.

989
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,810
- Here I go.
- You got it.

990
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,750
(Sensing Jong Min's success,
the next player gets ready.)

991
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,550
(Jumping rope 53 times)

992
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,750
(Jumping rope 54 times)

993
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,020
(Bottoms up?)

994
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,090
- What?
- What?

995
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,260
(He picked vinegar.)

996
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,220
(Their second try fails.)

997
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,060
You failed.

998
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,260
(The sourness stabs his throat.)

999
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
Goodness.
(Laughing)

1000
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,860
Move out so that
I can see him perform.

1001
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,270
He's performing.

1002
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,540
(Giving a vinegar performance)

1003
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,370
I drank so much. It's so sour.

1004
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,170
They're having a birthday party.

1005
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,240
This time...

1006
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,740
It's Team Security.

1007
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,380
Team Security? Oh, no.

1008
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,880
(They look frightened.)

1009
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:00,150
(A commanding presence)

1010
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,320
The last one, please leave.

1011
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,190
We don't accept any wrestlers.

1012
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,790
Who's the last one?

1013
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,030
Let's do it already.

1014
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,960
- Let's do it fast.
- Let's hurry.

1015
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,430
- All right.
- Team Security.

1016
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,700
They're only taking the meat.

1017
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,200
(A pile of meat)

1018
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,670
They're taking so much galbi.

1019
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,210
- It looks so delicious.
- That's too much.

1020
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,340
Why are you taking so much?

1021
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,840
Haven't you eaten today?

1022
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,880
Why would you eat so much?

1023
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,550
- Goodness.
- What?

1024
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,980
We must hurry.

1025
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,250
- We don't have time for this.
- Let's do it fast.

1026
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,150
Everyone, please set it up.

1027
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,650
They're eating
whatever they can grab.

1028
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,360
(Devouring without looking up)

1029
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,490
Which one is it?

1030
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,060
It depends on the lighting.

1031
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,730
Jong Min,
you can't get close to them.

1032
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,960
It doesn't matter
because you can smell everything.

1033
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,030
- Really?
- It's hard to distinguish.

1034
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,130
- I spat all over the table.
- Okay.

1035
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,530
Okay, let's go.

1036
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,440
You can't tell, right?

1037
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,800
- This one is really...
- Can you keep going?

1038
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,110
Seon Ho, are you okay?

1039
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,140
I'm completely fine.

1040
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,210
(Jumping rope 61 times)

1041
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
Get ready.

1042
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,580
(If they succeed this time,
there will be enough food.)

1043
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,610
Set.

1044
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,780
(Their third try starts.)

1045
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,950
(His legs are getting weaker.)

1046
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,550
- Okay.
- Se Yoon succeeded.

1047
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,920
Congratulations
on your first birthday!

1048
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,860
Congratulations
on your first birthday!

1049
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,060
(The master of tearing clothes)

1050
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,190
- He got it.
- Jong Min.

1051
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,460
Please, Jong Min. You've got this.

1052
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,960
My goodness.

1053
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,770
They look the same.

1054
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,930
(Is it the middle?)

1055
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:24,970
- Okay.
- Okay.

1056
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,140
- Let's go.
- Here I go.

1057
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,470
(He picks the glass
on the left instead.)

1058
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,170
(I won't fail twice.)

1059
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,540
- Let's go.
- Here I go.

1060
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,140
He's got it.

1061
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,980
(Spitting)

1062
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,680
(Their third try fails.)

1063
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,490
(Struggling)

1064
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,990
It's a performance.

1065
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,560
Weren't you going to pick
the one in the middle?

1066
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,820
I almost picked the one
in the middle.

1067
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,430
(What about the glass in the middle
that he was going to pick?)

1068
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,430
This was it.

1069
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,770
I changed my mind
at the last moment.

1070
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,270
- Goodness.
- All right.

1071
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,870
You failed.

1072
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,470
- They need me.
- Everyone,

1073
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,010
there's a birthday party over here.

1074
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,210
(The next guests look anything
but ordinary.)

1075
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,710
The first guy runs an eating show.

1076
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,250
We need to exclude the YouTuber.

1077
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,080
- Who are you?
- He's on YouTube.

1078
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,220
Mr. YouTube.

1079
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,580
He's being a picky eater.

1080
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,120
You usually eat a lot anyway.

1081
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,250
That's enough.

1082
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,920
- Look at him eat.
- What's wrong with you?

1083
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,330
(Kim Won Jib on Audio Team,
Meat Juice Lover)

1084
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,590
- Don't you want some tangsuyuk?
- Stop serving yourself.

1085
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,400
Won Jib is being impolite.

1086
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,800
Two?

1087
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,730
I'm taking off my microphone.

1088
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,030
Go ahead.

1089
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,900
(And Byung Jin Mo...)

1090
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,870
Byung Jin Mo, you're a good son.
Don't do this.

1091
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,940
- Jin Mo, what's wrong with you?
- There's a lot of other food.

1092
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,010
- Hey.
- Leave it.

1093
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,080
Don't do this.

1094
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,510
(Exchanging his plate
with the plate of galbi)

1095
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,850
What are you doing?

1096
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,250
- He's exaggerating.
- What is he doing?

1097
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,390
He's influenced by TV too much.

1098
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,990
It was actually funny.

1099
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,590
- He's influenced by TV too much.
- It was funny.

1100
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,790
He thinks he's a celebrity.

1101
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,890
I learned something from him.

1102
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,460
Okay,
we still have a lot of food left.

1103
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,530
The galbi is already at risk
of disappearing.

1104
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,540
Look at the galbi.
More than half of it is gone.

1105
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,670
Could you please leave me
some rice cakes?

1106
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,770
- He eats a lot on YouTube.
- The rice cakes are key.

1107
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,080
Don't you want some tomatoes?

1108
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,750
Hey, look.

1109
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,680
- What's wrong with them?
- They're eating the main dish only.

1110
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,920
This is similar
to watermelon hwachae.

1111
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,050
- Aren't you getting some rice?
- Why aren't they eating tangsuyuk?

1112
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,390
(Starting to get refills)

1113
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,760
Everyone, please set it up again.

1114
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,820
(Food for 10 people remains.)

1115
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,860
Jong Min.

1116
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,460
We will take one of them out.

1117
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,430
Okay.

1118
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,300
This is tiring.

1119
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,270
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1120
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,430
You went easy on me.

1121
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,270
Now I have a 50 percent
chance of winning.

1122
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,740
Seon Ho, are you ready?

1123
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,370
- All right. Here we go.
- Get ready.

1124
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,740
Guys,
we have a good chance of winning.

1125
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,940
One, two, three.

1126
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,540
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1127
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,110
(Swearing brotherhood)

1128
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,380
I have a 50 percent chance
of winning, so I can do it.

1129
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,710
- Thank you.
- Really?

1130
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,320
I have a 50 percent chance
of winning, so I can do it.

1131
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,580
I already found it.

1132
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,750
(The food is disappearing.)

1133
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,820
Get ready,

1134
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,490
set...

1135
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,620
(Their 4th try starts.)

1136
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,430
Let's start right away.

1137
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,090
Se Yoon, let's go. Keep going.

1138
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,500
(Inhaling)

1139
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,200
Se Yoon succeeded.

1140
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,600
(One shot, one kill)

1141
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Okay.

1142
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,170
(Amazed)

1143
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,240
He blew them out in one go.

1144
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,170
- Se Yoon succeeded.
- Congratulations...

1145
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,210
on your first birthday.

1146
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,040
Joon succeeded.

1147
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,080
- It's my turn.
- Let's go.

1148
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,910
- Cheers.
- Let's go!

1149
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,920
(Please clear it this time.)

1150
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,250
Cheers.

1151
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,190
He got it.

1152
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,790
- Okay.
- Jong Min succeeded.

1153
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
He got it.

1154
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,420
We just need DinDin to succeed.

1155
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,090
You got it right.

1156
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,790
They're broken.

1157
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,560
- They're broken.
- They're broken.

1158
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,870
We just need DinDin to pull it out
in an instant.

1159
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,270
One, two, go.

1160
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,430
(Seon Ho is getting exhausted.)

1161
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,140
(The food is disappearing
at a frightening speed.)

1162
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,440
(I'm determined to succeed
this time.)

1163
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
Pull.

1164
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,940
- Okay.
- He got it.

1165
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,910
(Okay!)

1166
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,810
(It's a success.)

1167
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,980
A tangerine fell off.

1168
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,050
(It's not a success.)

1169
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,990
- Okay, he got it.
- What's wrong?

1170
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,960
What's wrong?

1171
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,290
Mission failed.

1172
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,590
- The tangerine.
- What's wrong?

1173
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,460
- What's wrong?
- You dropped a tangerine.

1174
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,960
One of the tangerines fell off.

1175
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,970
(The situation a few minutes ago)

1176
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,470
(Happy First Birthday)

1177
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,000
(Unfortunately,
a tangerine fell off.)

1178
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,070
You dropped a tangerine.

1179
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,440
One of the tangerines fell off.

1180
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,910
Could you decide more quickly
than that?

1181
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,940
- Yes, but...
- Just a little bit.

1182
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,610
- But it was so close.
- I see.

1183
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,820
Everyone,
there's a birthday party over here.

1184
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,220
- Jung Hyun is getting seconds.
- Who is it this time?

1185
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,280
Why are you eating more?

1186
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,090
- Leave some food for us.
- No refills.

1187
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,850
The YouTuber should stop eating.

1188
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,920
Why are there more people coming?

1189
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,720
- What?
- Are foreigners here too?

1190
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,260
(The maximum number
of guests arrived.)

1191
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,830
This is a global birthday party.

1192
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,000
(Soon, the tables are full.)

1193
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,100
There are foreigners.

1194
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,960
How did the tangerine fall off?

1195
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,370
(The birthday guys
start to analyze why they failed.)

1196
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,200
- We should fix it.
- Right.

1197
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,340
It's done.

1198
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,400
(Fixing the tangerines
with each other's weight)

1199
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,740
Give it a try. Is it okay now?

1200
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,180
(Checking thoroughly)

1201
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,280
It will be okay this time.
We fixed the tangerines.

1202
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,680
We fixed them.

1203
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,310
Guys, the galbi is gone.

1204
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,450
My goodness.

1205
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,420
The galbi is almost gone.

1206
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,620
(Only a few pieces of galbi remain.)

1207
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,920
Hyun Woo,
don't you want some tomatoes?

1208
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,460
Do you not eat them?

1209
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,630
- I mostly eat meat.
- Really?

1210
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,690
(I mostly eat meat.)

1211
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,600
(Is he getting more?)

1212
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,130
(He's getting more food.)

1213
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,070
- What?
- Is he getting more food?

1214
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,170
He's getting more food.

1215
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,000
What's wrong with you?

1216
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,640
That's his third.

1217
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,780
He's getting only one tomato.

1218
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,450
Is it delicious?

1219
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,110
Is the galbi delicious?

1220
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,180
(Not much food is left.)

1221
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,150
Let's hurry up.
The food is disappearing.

1222
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Let's get going.

1223
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,550
- Okay, we can do it.
- We can do it.

1224
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,190
Try to succeed.

1225
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,960
Let's get it this time.
Let's get the remaining food.

1226
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,360
DinDin,
just pull it with confidence.

1227
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,860
Get ready, set...

1228
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,330
(Their 5th try starts.)

1229
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,370
We can do it!

1230
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,900
(Jumping rope 106 times)

1231
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,900
(Jumping rope 107 times)

1232
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,270
- Congratulations.
- Success.

1233
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,470
(They clear the 2nd
and 3rd missions hastily.)

1234
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,670
- Joon succeeded.
- Okay.

1235
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,780
Go.

1236
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,110
- Let's go!
- I don't think that's the one.

1237
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,250
- He got it.
- That's the wrong one.

1238
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,310
- Okay.
- He succeeded.

1239
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,250
(Clearing the 4th mission safely)

1240
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,020
(Getting ready for his mission
since the 5th will be cleared)

1241
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,020
Okay.

1242
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,820
I picked the brush.
Why are there so many?

1243
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,920
(He picked ten pairs,
the highest number.)

1244
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,660
You have to break them
no matter what.

1245
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,960
- Let's go.
- Hey.

1246
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,860
(He tries it with all his might.)

1247
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,930
Sae Ho.

1248
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:30,830
Sae Ho.

1249
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,640
Sae Ho, just once.

1250
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,740
Sae Ho, try one more time.

1251
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,440
At once. Sae Ho.

1252
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,980
(The guests are also intrigued.)

1253
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,150
(He keeps trying
with all his might.)

1254
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,380
Pull up all your energy
and do it at once.

1255
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,620
Imagine them going in.

1256
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,090
(The stubborn wooden chopsticks
won't break.)

1257
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,120
Hurry up.

1258
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,720
Hurry up.

1259
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,890
(To make the matter worse,
Seon Ho is getting exhausted.)

1260
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,130
Sae Ho, try one more time.
It's the last time.

1261
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,490
(He has to succeed quickly.)

1262
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
Are you giving up?

1263
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,530
Sae Ho, try it until you make it.

1264
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,730
We have a lot of time.

1265
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,800
It's just hard on Seon Ho.

1266
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,540
(Take your time.
It's just hard on Seon Ho.)

1267
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,110
- Are you giving up?
- No, one last time.

1268
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,140
It's his last time.

1269
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,480
(His bottoms refuse to give up.)

1270
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,180
(Screaming)

1271
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,250
- Are you giving up?
- I'll try one last time.

1272
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,810
It's his last time. Please.

1273
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,750
(Use every ounce of strength!)

1274
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,790
I can't do it.

1275
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,920
- You failed.
- This is too hard.

1276
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,320
(Their 5th try fails.)

1277
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,290
- You failed.
- This is too hard.

1278
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,360
- How many are there?
- I don't know.

1279
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,800
- There are too many.
- I'm sorry, Seon Ho.

1280
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,400
(I'm sorry, Seon Ho.)

1281
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,530
This isn't easy.

1282
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,670
(He's reminded
of the nightmare 1 year ago.)

1283
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,040
The YouTuber is eating more.

1284
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,510
Isn't that too much?

1285
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,170
How many times did you get food?

1286
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,410
(Refilling for the fourth time)

1287
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,380
Jung Hyun is getting his fourth.

1288
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,450
- Gosh, I'm hungry now.
- I figured it out.

1289
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,350
I'll try it this time. I'm sorry.

1290
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,920
There were so many.

1291
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,820
- Everyone, let's go.
- We can do it.

1292
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,390
Here we go. Get ready.

1293
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,860
We can do it.

1294
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,460
Get ready.

1295
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,030
Here we go. Get ready,

1296
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,030
- set...
- Stay strong.

1297
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,500
(Tired)

1298
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,200
(Jumping rope 133 times)

1299
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,170
The rope got too loose.

1300
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,910
(The staff member
turning the rope is also tired.)

1301
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:16,910
Okay.

1302
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,970
(Quick)

1303
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,440
Okay, Joon succeeded.

1304
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,610
Okay, that's it.
(146 times)

1305
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,850
(147 times)

1306
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:24,850
(148 times)

1307
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,520
Jong Min succeeded.

1308
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,280
- I picked the gavel. Okay.
- Jong Min succeeded.

1309
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,390
This one looks okay.

1310
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,390
DinDin, Sae Ho got it.
He got it this time.

1311
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,560
(Sensing Sae Ho's success,
he gets ready right away.)

1312
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,860
- What's wrong all of a sudden?
- What's wrong?

1313
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,090
Wait.

1314
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,430
(Will he fail again?)

1315
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,060
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

1316
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,400
He must be tired.

1317
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,170
- Okay.
- Okay.

1318
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,530
Sae Ho succeeded.

1319
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,870
(Only DinDin who hasn't
succeeded once remains.)

1320
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,340
(Will they succeed this time?)

1321
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,310
- Pull it out fast.
- I can't watch this.

1322
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,910
Pull it underneath fast.

1323
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,540
I can't watch this.

1324
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,310
Pull it underneath fast.

1325
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,550
I can't watch this.

1326
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,120
- Do it slowly.
- Use the body...

1327
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,880
- That's right.
- DinDin succeeded.

1328
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,320
(Happy First Birthday)

1329
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,060
(A complete success)

1330
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,220
Slowly.

1331
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,460
Seon Ho, move forward.

1332
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,930
What do we do next?

1333
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,390
Keep your eye on it. Watch the rope.

1334
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,560
Here I go.

1335
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,230
Hurry up and go in.
It's tiring for them.

1336
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,330
I hope you succeed.

1337
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,100
- Do you know when you're going in?
- Yes. It's okay.

1338
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,370
One. Hurry up and go in.
It's tiring for them.

1339
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,380
Go in. Two, three.

1340
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,940
When do I go in?

1341
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,050
- When do I go in?
- Two, three.

1342
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,150
- Can you tell me?
- Go in.

1343
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,950
Jump.

1344
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,560
Jump.

1345
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,160
(Everyone goes in safely,)

1346
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,660
(including Se Yoon.)

1347
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,190
(They clear the mission
once they jump rope 5 times.)

1348
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,360
Be careful with your legs.

1349
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,200
One, two,

1350
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,270
three, four,

1351
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,740
- five.
- Five.

1352
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,440
(They clear the mission
on their sixth try.)

1353
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,170
Okay!

1354
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,640
(We're finally getting dinner.)

1355
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,610
(Joyful)

1356
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,340
(Let's hurry and eat.)

1357
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,810
Congratulations
on your first birthday!

1358
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:04,810
We got it.

1359
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,250
- What was that?
- That startled me.

1360
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,420
- What was that?
- That startled me.

1361
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:21,200
(Gosh, that startled me.)

1362
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,600
- Gosh, that startled me.
- Goodness.

1363
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,200
(We didn't know
you'd be this startled.)

1364
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,170
- Hey, what was that?
- What is it?

1365
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,610
- That scared the life out of me.
- That startled me.

1366
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:30,810
(The Dinner Game ends
with the teary confetti salute.)

1367
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:32,170
It scared me. Gosh.

1368
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,180
Hey, stop eating.
You should stop eating.

1369
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,850
- Guys, hurry and get your food.
- Stop eating!

1370
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:38,410
Hey, stop eating!

1371
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,720
(Seeing them scoop up more food
with indifference)

1372
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,780
- You should stop eating now!
- It scared me.

1373
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,120
The party is over!

1374
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:45,420
Why are you standing there?

1375
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,190
(The plate was full of galbi
before the party started.)

1376
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,560
- Hey, look at the galbi.
- Much of the food is gone.

1377
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,690
- Gosh.
- We should get what's left.

1378
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,560
There's no galbi left.

1379
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:55,400
Where is the meat?

1380
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,900
(The last piece of meat)

1381
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,230
I'm so exhausted.

1382
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,440
Good job, Seon Ho.

1383
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,870
We made it in the end.

1384
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,810
- Right.
- Seon Ho, it's all thanks to you.

1385
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:03,970
We would've failed without him.

1386
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:05,210
My clothes are all wet.

1387
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,280
(He's covered in sweat.)

1388
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,340
(He's the one who made it possible
for them to succeed.)

1389
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,380
Legs... Oh, no.
We have no legs left.

1390
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,650
Oh, I found one. Okay.

1391
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,950
This is enough.

1392
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,190
I think I'll finish all the food.
I'm hungry.

1393
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,520
I really wanted to eat this
when we came here.

1394
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,660
(You can't have dinner
without a hearty stew.)

1395
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,890
Thank you for the food.

1396
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,230
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy your meal.

1397
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,960
- Good job, everyone.
- Great job, guys.

1398
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,400
- We all did a good job.
- Good job.

1399
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,600
- Right.
- All of us did well.

1400
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:31,070
- I'm glad we get to eat.
- Right.

1401
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,170
- We barely succeeded in time.
- Right.

1402
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,970
(He tries the kimchi stew first.)

1403
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:40,110
The kimchi stew is good.

1404
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,110
(It suits his palate perfectly.)

1405
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:44,210
- Nice.
- This is what I'm talking about.

1406
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,680
Kimchi stew is tasty
when it's cooked in bulk.

1407
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,490
(He has a big bite of the stew.)

1408
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,890
- It's hearty and tasty.
- Right?

1409
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,020
(Having a spoonful of rice)

1410
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,060
It's so good.

1411
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,290
I really like this kind of meal.

1412
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,700
(It's so delicious.)

1413
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,070
It's good.

1414
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:11,310
(Chicken is a must for a feast.)

1415
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,010
My, it's crazy good.

1416
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,280
(The birthday party food
suits everyone's palate.)

1417
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,110
It's still tasty.

1418
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,580
It's good.

1419
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:21,150
(Slurping)

1420
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:22,580
(Happy)

1421
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,820
- It's good.
- Indeed.

1422
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,450
Is it good?

1423
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,360
(The food tastes even better
after hard work.)

1424
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,360
I really like this kind of meal.

1425
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,400
By the way, we're celebrating
a first birthday party,

1426
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,830
but all they did was eat
without congratulating us.

1427
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,840
None of them congratulated us
on the birthday.

1428
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,540
- They're just busy eating food.
- Exactly.

1429
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,470
(Do not speak to us
while we're eating food.)

1430
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,840
- It's so good.
- They're eating with gusto.

1431
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
- Indeed.
- The food is really good.

1432
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,550
- They're all enjoying the food.
- Joon.

1433
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,550
Jung Hyun had four plates.

1434
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,220
Was the brush tethered to
the highest number of chopsticks?

1435
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,720
Right. How many sticks were there?

1436
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,950
I think there were about 20 of them.

1437
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:00,390
(Sae Ho's bottoms went through a lot
as he picked 10 pairs.)

1438
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,760
- Joon completed his mission fast.
- Congratulations!

1439
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,190
(Tearing Joon,
the hidden hero of this mission)

1440
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,230
And Jong Min contributed a lot
to our success.

1441
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,200
- Gosh.
- He did way better than expected.

1442
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,530
(I really did a good job.)

1443
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,170
- That's right.
- Okay.

1444
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,140
We made a touching scene
through this mission.

1445
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,370
(They finally made a touching scene
in the evening.)

1446
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,610
I think this is better
than fake friendliness.

1447
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,410
We just can't force ourselves
to compliment one another.

1448
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,240
We encouraged one another
sincerely this time.

1449
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,910
You guys didn't complain
when I failed my mission.

1450
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:23,950
- You cheered me up.
- Right.

1451
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:24,980
It was a difficult thing to do.

1452
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,380
All of us have been eating
a lot of food today.

1453
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,520
The food is good.

1454
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,520
- This rarely happened before.
- That's right.

1455
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,520
It's our first birthday party.
Can we get something to drink?

1456
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,790
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

1457
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,760
At least give beverages
to the two stars of the day.

1458
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:38,330
Right.

1459
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,760
I won't drink any
unless we all get to drink.

1460
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,800
(The loyal man wants to
share beverages with the others.)

1461
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,130
Then can I drink yours?

1462
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,570
Well, I wouldn't appreciate that.

1463
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,330
(He flat out refused.)

1464
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,140
(Right then)

1465
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,600
This is a first birthday present
for you.

1466
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,340
- Thank you.
- Please have some.

1467
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,110
Sharing is caring. Am I right?

1468
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,110
- That's right.
- Thank you.

1469
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,850
- As time goes by,
- It's really tasty.

1470
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:01,580
I feel happier that
I decided to join this show.

1471
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,990
There's something
that differentiates us from others.

1472
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,420
- We work like a team.
- We are a team.

1473
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,890
- We sleep together.
- Absolutely.

1474
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:11,060
When I have an interview,
I often talk about our team.

1475
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,100
I've been learning a lot
from you guys.

1476
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,930
And this experience makes me
reflect on myself,

1477
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:19,230
which helps me grow as a person.

1478
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,100
I really mean it.

1479
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,070
- We're lucky to have you two.
- Absolutely.

1480
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,410
We now have 2 new great members,
not just 1.

1481
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:28,480
(Sae Ho and Joon are now vital
to the 2 Days and 1 Night team.)

1482
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,450
Let's clink our glasses.

1483
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,180
- Jong Min will give a toast first.
- That'll be great.

1484
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,980
- Then you two say a few words.
- Okay.

1485
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,450
After that, we'll shout,
"2 Days and 1 Night," and drink.

1486
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:40,020
Sae Ho and Joon,
congratulations on your first birthday.

1487
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,690
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1488
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,160
- Thank you.
- You two say a few words too.

1489
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,530
(He passed the baton quickly.)

1490
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,360
From now on,
I will be more honest and sincere...

1491
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,030
- Gosh. What was that?
- when I speak.

1492
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,370
- It didn't sound sincere at all.
- I promise you...

1493
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:54,840
that I will work even harder...

1494
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,810
so that 2 Days and 1 Night
will become the best show.

1495
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,640
- I will do my best.
- This is your first birthday.

1496
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,680
Yes.

1497
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,480
We have a member
who's been on the show for 18 years.

1498
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,480
Right. Exactly.

1499
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,380
- How should I put it?
- I'm like a high school boy now.

1500
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,220
I'll continue working hard until I
celebrate my 30-year anniversary...

1501
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,190
- with Jong Min.
- That's great.

1502
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,690
You saw the person
walking with a stick.

1503
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:12,820
- Yes, we should keep going on.
- That's our future.

1504
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,490
Let's shout our chant.

1505
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,720
Who are we?

1506
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,990
- 2 Days and 1 Night!
- 2 Days and 1 Night!

1507
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,060
- Let's go on for 30 more years.
- Let's do that.

1508
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,470
Sae Ho and Joon,
give the rice cakes to the staff.

1509
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:26,340
- Right. Let's do that, Joon.
- Okay? Share it with them.

1510
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:28,440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1511
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,840
It's been a year since Sae Ho
and Joon joined the show.

1512
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,110
Thank you.
We appreciate your hard work.

1513
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,780
- Hello.
- Thank you.

1514
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,980
Please keep loving Hoya and Joon.

1515
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,650
It's been a year
since they joined the show.

1516
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,680
- Thank you.
- Although we don't have...

1517
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,920
- enough rice cakes for everyone...
- Thank you.

1518
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,550
- Thank you.
- Give four to the director.

1519
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,360
Do the Choi Hong Man impression
to make this more fun.

1520
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,890
Thank you.

1521
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,360
(Laughing)

1522
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,160
(Great job, my friend.)

1523
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,330
Thank you so much.

1524
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,500
- That was funny.
- Thank you.

1525
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,930
(He finishes up
with a refreshing voice of his own.)

1526
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,900
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1527
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,640
(Everyone,
thank you for your congratulations.)

1528
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,540
- This warms my heart.
- That's right.

1529
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,980
Why am I choked with emotions?
It's touching.

1530
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:08,940
So he stands right here,
and you clap...

1531
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,250
by hitting his hand like this.

1532
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,880
- Good. Let's do that.
- Slate together.

1533
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,050
Do a high five instead.

1534
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,280
- Ready? In 1, 2, 3. Let's... Wait.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1535
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,250
In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

1536
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,450
Let's go!

1537
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,960
Joon, let's work even harder.

1538
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:25,430
(It's already dark outside
at the summer night in Suwon.)

1539
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,930
Let's get going.

1540
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,230
(Let's get going!)

1541
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,270
I guess we'll play a loud game.

1542
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,700
You're here.

1543
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,300
(The staff asked the members to come
to the 2nd floor of the building.)

1544
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,370
What's going on?

1545
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,810
Wait. What's going on?

1546
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:39,270
Everyone, look here please.

1547
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,080
- Oh, my. Look at that.
- They prepared a lot for the game.

1548
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,510
- What is this?
- What's going on?

1549
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:43,950
It seems like we're going to play
an unusual game.

1550
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,250
You should wash up
and go to bed now.

1551
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,180
- We should go to bed.
- It's time for bed.

1552
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:49,320
Since we're celebrating
Hoya and Joon's first birthday,

1553
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,620
you'll play a game
that requires good teamwork...

1554
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,190
to decide whether you'll
sleep indoors or outdoors.

1555
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,390
- Is it a group mission?
- I wonder what game it is.

1556
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:56,490
- Yes.
- I guess we'll sink or swim.

1557
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,360
Today's Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors
is...

1558
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,330
United We Live, Caught We Die.

1559
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:02,800
- "Caught?"
- "Caught?"

1560
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,170
- Caught by what?
- Let me explain the rules.

1561
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,730
The six of you...

1562
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,840
will play the game
while tethered to one another.

1563
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:11,710
Right after I say,
"Green light, red light,"

1564
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,080
the camera at the end of the hall...

1565
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,710
- will take a photo.
- I see.

1566
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,480
All of you must avoid
getting caught on camera...

1567
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:21,380
until you reach the end of the hall.

1568
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,850
Then all of you will sleep indoors.

1569
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,320
We should hide somewhere
to avoid getting caught.

1570
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,350
You should hide.

1571
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,520
You can hide in a room...

1572
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,820
that's unlocked.

1573
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,190
Are all the rooms unlocked?

1574
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,190
You need to check.

1575
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,830
You have only three attempts.

1576
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,500
If you fail,
all of you will sleep outdoors.

1577
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,700
Let us ask you some questions.

1578
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,600
If my shoulder is in a photo,
does that mean we fail?

1579
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,010
- Well...
- Only the face?

1580
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:45,910
With even just a pinky in the photo,
you're out.

1581
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,410
That's cold-hearted.

1582
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,040
Let's try our best to the end.

1583
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,450
If we fail, we come back here
and start over again?

1584
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:51,450
- That's correct.
- Let's do a chant.

1585
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:52,510
One, two, three.

1586
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,520
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

1587
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,980
- Okay!
- Okay!

1588
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,550
- Let's sleep comfortably tonight.
- Please sit.

1589
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,590
(Wearing tethers)

1590
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,520
(Planning a strategy)

1591
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,620
If both are unlocked,
we'll run about in confusion.

1592
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,660
- We should just trust him.
- Right. DinDin, we'll count on you.

1593
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,790
- Right. We'll...
- Keep the rope...

1594
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,160
as short as you can by keeping up
with the person in front of you.

1595
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,000
Let's move fast
and keep up with DinDin.

1596
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,230
- That's what I was talking about.
- Really?

1597
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,900
- For now...
- Are we going far at first?

1598
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,100
- No, we'll try a close one.
- Okay.

1599
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,540
Should I check the one
on the right side first?

1600
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,940
- Let's go for the right one first.
- Left or right? Okay.

1601
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,280
If the right one is locked,
move to the left right away.

1602
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,410
If the line is too long,
we could get caught on camera.

1603
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:24,350
- He's right.
- Those at the back can get caught.

1604
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,850
- We must stay close to one another.
- We must stay close together.

1605
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,680
- Our strategy is to be united.
- Stay close.

1606
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,750
- Right. We'll move together.
- Okay.

1607
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,850
- The game's title has the answer.
- That's right.

1608
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,450
- We'll be united.
- That's settled, and...

1609
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,190
- My belly is sticking out a lot.
- Let's think we're going to...

1610
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:35,720
sleep outdoors all together
while playing the game.

1611
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,190
- Why should we think that way?
- Right.

1612
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,960
- So that we can empty our minds.
- Why should we think that way?

1613
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,560
- No, we won't do that.
- Oh, okay. Got it.

1614
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,500
- Guys, come and look here.
- They're getting so upset at me.

1615
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,900
Then what's the point of doing this?
We can just sleep outdoors.

1616
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,330
- Listen to me.
- What?

1617
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,740
- Here's what I think.
- Okay. What is it?

1618
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,000
In the 1st 2 attempts,

1619
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,110
we need to check as many doors
as we can.

1620
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,640
- We need to check that.
- Okay.

1621
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,910
Everyone, stay alert.

1622
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,810
This is a matter of life or death.

1623
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,650
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1624
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,810
- We'll go right first.
- I might step on his feet.

1625
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,380
- Let's begin now.
- We should check the door.

1626
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,020
Focus, everyone.
We should stay focused.

1627
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:04,850
- Are we going right first?
- I'm nervous.

1628
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,350
- We're going right first.
- I'm so nervous.

1629
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,990
Green light,

1630
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,630
- red light.
- Come here. Come on in.

1631
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,130
(Click)

1632
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,570
(Hide yourselves)

1633
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:22,340
(Ready or not, here I come)

1634
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,340
Green light...

1635
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,710
(Luckily, the lounge was unlocked!)

1636
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,380
Okay. Open the door.

1637
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,780
Look ahead so we can decide
where we should go...

1638
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,320
- We should hear the clicking sound.
- No, we...

1639
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,880
Let's go a little farther this time.

1640
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,850
- Okay. How far do you want to go?
- Hey.

1641
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,720
- The room next to us.
- If the door is locked,

1642
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,090
- we should move fast to hide.
- Green light,

1643
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,290
- Wait. Don't go out.
- red light.

1644
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,230
- Let's go now.
- No. We should wait.

1645
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,860
We should go when he says,
"Green light, red light."

1646
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,900
Why are we still here?

1647
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,970
If the door is locked, come back.

1648
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,100
Wait.

1649
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,440
Should we get going now?

1650
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,840
- My, they're sensitive.
- Shouldn't we get going now?

1651
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,300
- They're so sensitive.
- We should wait.

1652
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,140
We should go when he says,
"Green light, red light."

1653
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,240
(They're always serious
when food and bed are on the line.)

1654
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:06,850
(This is the farthest they can go
to check the rooms.)

1655
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,150
You're going there first, right?

1656
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,320
No?

1657
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,320
(Where will DinDin go?)

1658
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:14,420
Green light...

1659
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:18,460
(They are all running
toward Room 222.)

1660
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,560
(It's closed.)

1661
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,700
Red light.

1662
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,030
We shouldn't play it like this.

1663
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,240
- We can't play it like this.
- The door won't open.

1664
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,140
I know.
They said some rooms were locked.

1665
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,370
There are rooms that are locked.

1666
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:32,370
(Checking with the camera)

1667
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,180
- Did we make it?
- No, you failed.

1668
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,780
You can't touch the other doors.
Please go back.

1669
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,650
- Please go back to your place.
- These two doors are locked.

1670
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:41,920
- Room 204.
- Okay, I got it.

1671
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,890
- It's 1 of these 2 for sure.
- Please go back to your place.

1672
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:46,190
This is what I meant. Come here.

1673
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:47,420
Okay, let's follow him.

1674
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,560
(Going back to where they came from)

1675
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,790
So these two aren't...

1676
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,230
- Room 204...
- No!

1677
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:52,760
You can't open the doors.
Come on, now.

1678
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,760
- No.
- Where did we even come from?

1679
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,260
We came from here.

1680
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,830
We went there diagonally from here.

1681
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:59,400
Some rooms are locked.

1682
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,000
- So we have to...
- Let's move on to the next one.

1683
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,540
- This is what we have to do.
- Tell me.

1684
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,040
We shouldn't run with DinDin
when he runs toward the door.

1685
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,510
He should go and hit the door.

1686
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,110
Then he has to come back.

1687
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,050
- So we can...
- Back to the lounge?

1688
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,350
- Back to the lounge.
- That's right.

1689
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,020
- But that is...
- I think it's a good idea.

1690
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,780
Coming back to where we are
is a great idea.

1691
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,050
- Can we even go back?
- Well, I think...

1692
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,650
We can see a room across...

1693
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,920
from where we are.
It's about 1m away.

1694
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,920
- I try opening the door.
- If it opens,

1695
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,530
we all run toward that door.

1696
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,830
- That's a good idea.
- Like this.

1697
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:28,600
- Okay.
- So we move 1 by 1.

1698
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,100
- Right.
- Sae Ho's idea is great.

1699
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,230
- We can take our time.
- So I check the door first.

1700
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,100
Then you all go into the room
that is open.

1701
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:36,300
- I should be the sixth one then.
- This will work for sure.

1702
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,110
- Se Yoon can be the sixth one.
- Okay.

1703
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:39,140
You should be in sixth place.

1704
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,280
- Are you all okay?
- Sure.

1705
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,310
Give us a second.

1706
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,580
You are so serious.

1707
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,250
We are very serious.

1708
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:48,520
This is a matter
of using our brains.

1709
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,490
- We should all move forward.
- Are you all ready?

1710
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:52,750
- Yes.
- We can play now.

1711
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,060
This is your second attempt.

1712
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,860
- I'll run toward the right.
- Let's start.

1713
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,860
You can take your time.

1714
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,030
Let's go.

1715
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:00,500
Let's go.

1716
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,730
(Glare of a wild cat)

1717
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:11,310
Green light, red light.

1718
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,980
- I'll try opening this door.
- This is how we do it.

1719
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,180
- No, you can go to that room.
- No, not this one.

1720
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,880
- You mean Room 206?
- Yes, you can go that far.

1721
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,080
Come back as soon as it's locked.

1722
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,250
All right. I won't step outside.

1723
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,120
There is no camera on Room 206.

1724
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,650
Just go and check the door.

1725
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,250
- There is no camera.
- It could be a trap.

1726
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,760
So I just check Room 206.

1727
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,520
- Then I come back right away.
- Yes, come back here.

1728
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,660
We all should take part.

1729
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,730
Come back even if the door is open.

1730
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:31,960
Did you fart or something?

1731
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,900
- I didn't.
- Somebody did.

1732
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,370
(Somebody must have farted.)

1733
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:40,670
(Unexpected gas bomb)

1734
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:43,540
- Somebody farted.
- Green light...

1735
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,570
Hold on a second.

1736
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,710
- Come on.
- Who farted?

1737
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,410
- Goodness.
- Who is it?

1738
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,780
- I'm not playing.
- Someone farted in here.

1739
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:52,150
- It's Jong Min.
- No, I didn't fart.

1740
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,720
I smelled it. It's Seon Ho.

1741
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,480
- Come on.
- Goodness.

1742
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,850
- Come on.
- Hey!

1743
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:00,260
- My goodness.
- Why would he do that?

1744
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,790
Skinny ones have stinkier farts.

1745
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,630
Fat people's farts don't smell much
because we poop a lot.

1746
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:06,290
(The gas disturbed them
from focusing on the game.)

1747
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:10,100
- You should have...
- Green light...

1748
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,930
(A sad echo in the hallway)

1749
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,370
Please keep quiet.
I can't hear him at all.

1750
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,740
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1751
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,240
(Focusing on the game again)

1752
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,910
Why does he smell so bad?

1753
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,810
Skinny people stink when they fart.

1754
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:24,810
(Getting confused)

1755
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:26,010
Fat people don't stink.

1756
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,620
We poop a lot,
so we don't smell much.

1757
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,650
Green light...

1758
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:33,020
(Running toward Room 206)

1759
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,020
(It's open!)

1760
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,430
(However)

1761
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:38,490
Come back here again.

1762
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,760
- Okay.
- You have to come back!

1763
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,200
- Where are you going?
- You have to come back.

1764
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:45,230
(Paper Doll gets dragged.)

1765
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,400
You have to come back!
Where are you going?

1766
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,900
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

1767
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,540
(As a result)

1768
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:54,780
(Green light, red light)

1769
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,180
(Clicking)

1770
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,620
Everyone. You failed.

1771
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,490
You have to come back!
Where are you going?

1772
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:05,690
Where are you going?

1773
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,990
We shouldn't play it like this.

1774
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,020
- Where are you going?
- What are you doing?

1775
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,060
- You had to come back.
- You were supposed to come back.

1776
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,160
You said you would come back.

1777
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,230
- Why did you come in here?
- Why did you come into this room?

1778
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,500
- I mean...
- Because of the fart!

1779
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,700
I was so confused!

1780
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,830
- That doesn't make sense.
- I'm not kidding.

1781
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:21,600
- It's all right.
- Did you get his face?

1782
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,900
We got your bottoms.

1783
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,940
Whose bottoms?

1784
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,210
Yours.

1785
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:27,380
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

1786
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,740
I just lost my mind.

1787
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,380
- Why is this my fault?
- Why did you lose your mind?

1788
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,110
Because of Seon Ho's fart...

1789
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:34,180
- I was so confused.
- Goodness.

1790
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,120
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. We can still do it.

1791
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,820
- Why did you run?
- Why didn't you come back?

1792
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,790
He said it was because of my fart.

1793
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:41,890
I just asked him.

1794
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,760
I thought he got all of our faces
on the camera.

1795
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,090
But he only got my bottoms.

1796
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,960
So after he says the last word,

1797
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,600
he takes the photo
after about 1.5 seconds.

1798
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,200
He didn't get us
in the photos at all.

1799
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,830
So if we hadn't given up,

1800
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,700
we could have made it,
even if he had not come back.

1801
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:58,170
Everyone, don't touch anything.
Just go back to where you were.

1802
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,140
- Let's go. It's all right.
- I mean...

1803
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,110
We should go here.

1804
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,980
- This...
- These two rooms are locked.

1805
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,650
- With the next...
- These two are locked.

1806
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:07,680
We can't come back from there.
You should just open it.

1807
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,880
It doesn't matter
if it's left or right.

1808
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,650
I'm so sorry.

1809
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,750
It's all right. Let's go.

1810
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,260
- I lost my mind for a second.
- This will be hard now.

1811
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,760
- It will be hard now.
- I'm so sorry.

1812
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,060
We can still do it. It's fine.

1813
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,660
Listen. This is your last chance.

1814
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,160
We should just rely on our luck.
We have no choice.

1815
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,560
- It's all on our luck.
- The path is just too long.

1816
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,000
Who's the first one? Okay.

1817
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,630
- Just work on it.
- We didn't find...

1818
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:27,240
This is what my guts tell me.

1819
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:30,640
Try opening the door
that is on the same line.

1820
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,170
- You mean Room 204?
- Yes.

1821
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:33,880
You mean, skip this one...

1822
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,940
and open the next one?

1823
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,110
Are you all ready, everyone?

1824
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:38,110
Yes.

1825
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,150
I keep farting
because I'm getting nervous.

1826
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:40,650
This is your last attempt.

1827
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,050
(Third attempt)

1828
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,720
Let's go.

1829
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:49,420
- Green light,
- Get in there quickly.

1830
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,160
- red light.
- Get inside right now.

1831
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,090
We have to move faster,
even if we're on track.

1832
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,830
- We still have to go fast.
- Right.

1833
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:56,060
You all have to go faster.

1834
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,400
Those who stand in front
have to go faster.

1835
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,970
- Was it Room 206?
- Right.

1836
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,770
You just have to go this time.

1837
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,040
- Do I go in?
- Yes, just get in.

1838
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,140
Okay.

1839
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,570
- Just go inside the room this time.
- Try your best.

1840
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:09,280
Green light,

1841
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,480
- red light.
- We have to go straight.

1842
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,750
- We got it.
- We are here.

1843
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:13,980
Let's get some cold air
for a few seconds.

1844
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:14,980
I mean...

1845
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,320
You are hot already?

1846
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,590
- And now...
- Shall we get in?

1847
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,190
This is our last attempt.

1848
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,990
The left room was locked, right?

1849
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,390
Try opening the door
on the left as you run.

1850
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:23,730
- The left door was locked.
- Right.

1851
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:25,730
- Try opening the other one.
- These two were both locked.

1852
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,230
Do you want to come back
whether the door is locked or not?

1853
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,800
Okay, I'll come back
whether it's open or not.

1854
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,930
- Okay.
- Come back to this room.

1855
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,500
You have to come back
no matter what.

1856
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,630
- You have to come back.
- You must come back.

1857
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,740
- Then we should stay here.
- Okay, he's coming back.

1858
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,200
Try pulling me if I don't come back.

1859
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,540
Gosh, I'm out of energy now.

1860
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,140
He'll come back right away.

1861
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,280
- Green light...
- No, go back.

1862
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,910
(Why is he coming back
all of a sudden?)

1863
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,950
(Chaotic)

1864
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:50,020
(Gosh, that is nerve-racking.)

1865
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,190
We all went out at the wrong time.

1866
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,550
I went out too late.

1867
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,520
- We have to be quiet and listen.
- We should go out faster.

1868
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,590
I have to go out faster.

1869
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:57,590
I can't hear at all.

1870
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:59,160
- We come back?
- Yes, come back no matter what.

1871
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:04,700
- Green light...
- I...

1872
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:07,740
(It's open!)

1873
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,670
(However,)

1874
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,010
(Room 204 is farther
than they think.)

1875
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:14,540
I can't go back! It's too far.

1876
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:18,250
(Will they be able...)

1877
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,880
(to get in Room 204
without getting in the picture?)

1878
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,320
(Clicking)

1879
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,990
It was very close. You made it.

1880
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:34,130
(A narrow escape)

1881
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,800
Why do you keep
changing the strategy?

1882
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,970
- I couldn't go back!
- You should have...

1883
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:40,840
But what you did was great.

1884
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,100
No, it was still okay.

1885
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,570
- I thought...
- What do we do now, Sae Ho?

1886
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:45,710
We have to come back now.

1887
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:46,740
The room on the other side...

1888
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:48,280
Check if there is a room
we can go to on the other side.

1889
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,940
- This time, we should...
- The one across here?

1890
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,880
We should come back
after checking the room this time.

1891
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,220
This room over here?

1892
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,780
- No, not this one. Try that...
- We'll be in the picture if we...

1893
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,920
You have to come back
no matter what this time.

1894
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:00,690
Hold on. Can I take a look?

1895
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:01,890
We can check the room now...

1896
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,230
- We'll get in the picture.
- Don't go out.

1897
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:05,760
- Can we go outside now?
- No.

1898
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,700
- Come on.
- For five seconds...

1899
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,500
Who farted again?

1900
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,930
The room next to this...

1901
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,500
- Again?
- What on earth...

1902
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,730
- Come on.
- Did I fart?

1903
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,440
You have to come back.

1904
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,000
- Darn it.
- Goodness.

1905
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,010
What's wrong with him?

1906
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,040
- Hold on.
- I'm getting dizzy now.

1907
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:22,980
(People are saying
they are getting dizzy.)

1908
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,010
I'm dizzy.

1909
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:26,010
We're doing our best
to play this game.

1910
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,550
You can't keep farting!

1911
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:29,080
Hey, Sae Ho.

1912
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,150
(He'll lose his mind again
if this happens.)

1913
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,320
Sae Ho, that room on the diagonal?

1914
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,090
- Yes, that one.
- Come back after you check.

1915
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:34,590
- You have to come back.
- Come back after you check.

1916
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:36,290
Hold on. Can he even come back?

1917
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:37,390
Yes, he can come back.
It isn't that far.

1918
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:38,490
He can come back.

1919
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:40,430
It was hard
when we passed two rooms in a row.

1920
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:42,930
If we can't come back...

1921
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:45,300
We should go in if it opens.

1922
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,100
- If not, we come back.
- Right, if it opens,

1923
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,370
- I should give you an order.
- If it opens, why come back?

1924
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:49,840
I can say, "Come in now."

1925
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,010
That's right.
Why come back if the door opens?

1926
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,170
"Go back!"

1927
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:54,610
Then you tell us what to do.

1928
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,680
It would be hectic
if we all got confused there.

1929
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,210
- That's right.
- Okay.

1930
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,450
- Go straight, and...
- Just go fast.

1931
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,480
Go fast.

1932
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,680
- Tell us what to do, DinDin.
- Sure.

1933
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,890
You can run even faster.

1934
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,820
(Getting very nervous)

1935
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,360
Stop farting.

1936
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,090
(Laughing)

1937
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,990
Green light...

1938
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:15,660
(It's a great start.)

1939
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,970
Green light...

1940
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:20,670
(It's locked.)

1941
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:23,670
Green light,

1942
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,070
- red light.
- Go back!

1943
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,710
(It's going as planned.)

1944
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,380
(Clicking)

1945
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,280
You failed.

1946
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,450
(Third attempt failed)

1947
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:40,020
(They did their best
as they planned.)

1948
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:42,360
I told you we had to come back
no matter what.

1949
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,860
- Right, we had to come back.
- But we were fast.

1950
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,060
- You failed.
- We got mixed up there.

1951
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,560
- We failed.
- Oh, come on.

1952
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:49,860
Why?

1953
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,970
Let's do this one more time
since it's fun.

1954
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:54,470
You know the first attempt
was quite iffy.

1955
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:55,570
Which part?

1956
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:57,000
The second attempt was iffy.

1957
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,270
- You mean when he farted?
- Right.

1958
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:01,880
Did you get anyone on camera?

1959
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,010
(They have the audacity
to pester them for another chance.)

1960
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,610
Please give us one last chance.

1961
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:06,450
I was caught at the end.

1962
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,980
- I...
- Okay.

1963
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:09,920
We have one last chance.
Let's do this!

1964
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:13,790
(It looks like
they're quite disappointed.)

1965
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:15,020
- You could just...
- Don't get caught.

1966
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,220
Then...

1967
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,530
since it's Hoya and Joon's
one-year anniversary,

1968
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,160
- we'll give you one last chance.
- The last one.

1969
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,400
If you fail this attempt,
you will leave no regrets.

1970
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,070
- You...
- We'll just go.

1971
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:30,270
It's quicker to open the door.

1972
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:32,040
Let's first go to that point.

1973
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:33,770
Let's go to the point we reached.

1974
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,840
- From there...
- Let's decide from there.

1975
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,980
- I think we have to run.
- I...

1976
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,380
- Let's first go.
- Let's go.

1977
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,180
- Start!
- Okay, the last attempt!

1978
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,520
Go where we went.

1979
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,950
- Get ready.
- Let's go!

1980
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,090
Let's chant. One, two, three!

1981
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:48,360
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1982
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:52,660
Green light,

1983
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:55,300
red light.

1984
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:59,530
Green light,

1985
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:02,140
red light.

1986
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,210
- Green light...
- Let's go.

1987
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:08,340
(They quickly go to Room 204.)

1988
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:10,480
- Good.
- Good!

1989
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,150
(They have three choices!)

1990
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,850
(But...)

1991
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,190
- Good.
- Good!

1992
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,620
- Now...
- According to your calculations,

1993
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,620
do you think you're correct?

1994
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,160
- Hold on.
- Let me see.

1995
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,660
- I'll check.
- Will it work?

1996
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:26,990
- Won't it?
- What's wrong?

1997
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,030
I collided.

1998
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:29,460
(Joon and Se Yoon
are checking outside the door.)

1999
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:34,840
(3 minutes ago)

2000
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,510
I think we can all fit there
at once.

2001
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,510
- You can't be here.
- That won't work?

2002
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:41,180
We're here.

2003
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,510
I think we can make it
without opening the door.

2004
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:44,850
Hold on. Let's talk inside.

2005
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,780
Could you pause for a bit
and listen to us?

2006
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:48,780
Sure.

2007
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,750
- I think Joon is right.
- What is it?

2008
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:53,050
Let's keep talking to make it
seem like we'll enter a room,

2009
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:55,920
and let's just run from that room
until the end.

2010
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,160
I think he's right. We can go there.

2011
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:00,060
- I calculated it.
- Let's just go there at once.

2012
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,730
Not bad.

2013
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,400
You just have to run fast.

2014
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:04,870
Let's do this.

2015
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,600
(It's their last chance anyway.)

2016
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,600
(The members are deciding.)

2017
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,010
Let's go to the point we reached.

2018
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,910
- From there...
- Let's decide from there.

2019
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,750
(They reached Room 204 like that.)

2020
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,380
- Hold on.
- Let me see.

2021
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,120
- I'll check.
- Will it work?

2022
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,780
(He calculates the distance
without Director Joo noticing.)

2023
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:24,820
This...

2024
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,990
It will work, 100 percent.

2025
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:30,760
Okay.
Then we have to be ready to go back.

2026
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,760
Just charge.

2027
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,660
The people at the back
should be ready to go back.

2028
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,700
Whatever the case, if we go
and it doesn't open, we go back.

2029
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,670
- This is the last one.
- Even if it opens.

2030
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,540
- Okay.
- Let's go!

2031
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,140
- Get ready.
- Go back.

2032
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,340
- Get ready.
- Be quiet.

2033
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:47,140
Let's wait this one out.

2034
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,580
- Shall we...
- No. Let's go.

2035
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,940
- Let's go.
- Let's wait.

2036
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:50,980
- Let's wait.
- Wait.

2037
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:53,180
Let's wait and go on the next one.

2038
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:54,420
Wait. Check the beat.

2039
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:58,290
Green light...

2040
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,890
(One, two, three)

2041
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,590
(Run.)

2042
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:03,420
(DinDin's camera)

2043
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:07,160
(Let's charge!)

2044
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,160
- Red light.
- It worked.

2045
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,870
(Clicking)

2046
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:13,400
- It worked!
- We're here.

2047
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,540
- It worked.
- It worked.

2048
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:24,210
- It worked.
- It worked!

2049
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:26,050
We did it!

2050
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:29,280
(They almost didn't make it.)

2051
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,150
Well done.

2052
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:33,190
- We did it.
- It worked!

2053
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,990
I told you it would work.

2054
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,560
I told you so.

2055
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,960
- Well done.
- Good.

2056
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,360
- It's...
- This was Joon's idea.

2057
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,830
He said we could just run.

2058
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:45,070
This is fun.

2059
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:46,200
We did it, right?

2060
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,370
Let's make this...

2061
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:50,100
our signature game.

2062
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,970
This is really fun.

2063
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,540
- This is amazing.
- Sleep indoors.

2064
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:55,540
Nice.

2065
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:57,040
Success!

2066
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,280
(They succeeded today's
Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.)

2067
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,550
- Okay.
- Well done.

2068
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:01,250
- But...
- No, this...

2069
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,880
Joon gave us the idea.

2070
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,220
Joon and Sae Ho's idea did this.

2071
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:06,950
- Good!
- Good.

2072
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,920
- How did you come up with this?
- But we almost failed...

2073
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:10,520
at the end.

2074
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,430
- It was close.
- I thought we were caught.

2075
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:14,700
As a result of today's
Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors,

2076
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,760
everyone will sleep indoors.

2077
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,870
- Yes!
- It's been a while.

2078
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:22,040
We had the first birthday party
and succeeded in this.

2079
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,400
- It was nice.
- It was nice.

2080
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,970
We all slept indoors...

2081
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,570
- when we first came too.
- That's right.

2082
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:29,080
We grabbed teamwork today.

2083
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,980
You just have to wake up
tomorrow morning...

2084
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,280
- when the wake-up song plays.
- Okay.

2085
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,420
Get some good rest,
and we'll see you tomorrow.

2086
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:37,950
- Okay.
- Okay!

2087
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:39,890
One-year anniversary.
You all did great work.

2088
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:41,590
Let's grab some sleep now.

2089
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,920
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

2090
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,630
(They head to sleep.)

2091
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:49,030
(It's time to go to bed.)

2092
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,930
(The members will be sleeping here.)

2093
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:54,200
There are six of us.

2094
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,970
- Do we have to lay the blankets?
- Let's do that. Here.

2095
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:58,570
(They miraculously managed
to all sleep indoors.)

2096
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,270
What is this?

2097
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,550
- What is it?
- Let's look at it together.

2098
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:05,710
I think it's an album.

2099
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,080
(They're confused.)

2100
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,350
Is it going to be touching?

2101
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:12,120
What is that?

2102
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,790
- What is it?
- We got an album.

2103
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:14,860
What album?

2104
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:16,420
- Let's see.
- What is that?

2105
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,390
We got a gift.

2106
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:19,630
Are you sure that's a gift?

2107
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:21,300
- We got a gift and a letter.
- Isn't it a bomb?

2108
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,630
(There's a letter inside.)

2109
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:23,630
- Read it out loud.
- What does it say?

2110
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:26,670
"Dear members."

2111
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,200
"It's already been a year
since Sae Ho joined,"

2112
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,270
"Joon joined,"

2113
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:33,270
"and we started our journey
with six members."

2114
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:36,780
"Thank you so much for being
with us for the past year."

2115
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,150
"Let's do our best..."

2116
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:40,510
"to continue the journey
next year..."

2117
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,350
- "and the next as well."
- This is touching.

2118
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:43,380
This is touching.

2119
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,450
"We always cheer for you."

2120
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,890
- They wrote it well.
- It's very...

2121
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,420
- It's a good handwriting.
- calm...

2122
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:53,830
- That time.
- This is crazy.

2123
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:55,830
This was a year ago?

2124
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:57,700
(A photo album with the memories
of the past year)

2125
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:00,470
(It starts with the pictures
of when they met Sae Ho and Joon.)

2126
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:02,000
This is crazy.

2127
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,340
Goodness.

2128
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:04,970
I remember this time.

2129
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:06,840
Mount Daedun.

2130
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,980
- Right.
- Joon's face is blank.

2131
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,540
It really is blank.

2132
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,310
I remember this time.

2133
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,980
You took off your shirt
for the first time here.

2134
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,020
Right.

2135
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:16,950
He started taking his shirt off
from this time.

2136
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,050
- Feel good?
- Feel good.

2137
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:19,590
- What does it mean?
- Good?

2138
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:20,650
Right.

2139
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,790
This was the haunted house.

2140
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:24,290
I remember this.

2141
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:25,930
- We went to catch an octopus.
- Right.

2142
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,390
We had a gathering.

2143
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,630
(It was saved in the folder
called "Memories.")

2144
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,530
- This.
- The bridal shower.

2145
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:31,700
This day was really nice.

2146
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,030
- I remember this.
- Happy Winter Training Holiday.

2147
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,070
Our calendar. I use this at home.

2148
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,470
- Me too.
- I have it too.

2149
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:39,340
- This seems recent, doesn't it?
- This was the squid fishing game.

2150
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:40,440
- You injured your leg after this.
- Yes.

2151
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,740
Se Yoon didn't understand
the game that day.

2152
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:43,740
Right.

2153
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:45,550
I earned many things instead.

2154
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:48,420
- Six Jong Mins.
- Six Jong Mins.

2155
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:49,880
- It's already Jong Min's wedding.
- Jong Min's wedding?

2156
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,880
(The day they congratulated
Jong Min getting married)

2157
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,790
Bivouac.

2158
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:54,320
- It was tough.
- It's Jeju.

2159
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,020
- Jeju.
- Jeju.

2160
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,460
It's been a month
since we went to Jeju.

2161
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:59,660
- It all seems like yesterday.
- The opening.

2162
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,400
That's right. This one.

2163
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:03,830
- The friends.
- The friends episode.

2164
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,070
- The grandmothers.
- Grandmothers.

2165
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:08,700
- Gosh.
- We...

2166
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,500
Many things happened
during the year.

2167
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,510
Right.

2168
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:13,440
- Gosh.
- Time flies.

2169
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,740
- Why is this so touching?
- Time really flies.

2170
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:18,450
(One year passed by so quickly.)

2171
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:22,350
Let's start with Sae Ho.

2172
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,990
(I'm very grateful I got to join.)

2173
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,290
(I'll do my best...)

2174
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:30,290
(so I can make you laugh
with happiness.)

2175
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,560
(A truthful talk
without exaggeration)

2176
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,500
(Talks without lies.)

2177
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,560
(Please look forward to that.)

2178
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,170
(They started off...)

2179
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:40,700
(with such bold ambitions.)

2180
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:46,670
(But they experienced
a variety of new struggles.)

2181
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:49,680
(A weird journey...)

2182
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,750
(that lacks everything)

2183
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,920
(But...)

2184
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,890
(there are weirder people...)

2185
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:00,890
(who are very serious
about this journey.)

2186
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,660
(Welcome to 2 Days and 1 Night.)

2187
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,700
(They came to resemble each other
after spending time together.)

2188
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,670
(Talent: Blaming others)

2189
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:14,870
(Future dream:
Being the only one to succeed)

2190
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,940
(They quarrel every time
for these reasons.)

2191
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,880
(I'll use this...)

2192
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,980
(to send Lee Joon indoors.)

2193
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:26,780
(But sometimes,
they hold each other's hand.)

2194
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:28,780
(For Kim Jong Min.)

2195
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,120
(They cared for each other
with all their heart.)

2196
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:37,260
(They suffered a lot
during the year,)

2197
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:41,760
(but they also bonded as much.)

2198
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:47,170
This isn't just for these two.

2199
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:48,340
It was a year for all of us.

2200
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,700
Yes.

2201
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:51,940
(It leaves a strong impression.)

2202
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,440
- This is touching.
- This is amazing.

2203
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:55,680
- Well...
- Look at the time.

2204
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:57,980
I had a phone call with Gyu Ri.

2205
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:59,510
- You talked with her too, right?
- Yes.

2206
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:03,350
She asked,
"How was the year with the members?"

2207
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,750
And there was a lot
to be grateful for.

2208
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:08,260
I've been in this industry
for a long time,

2209
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,790
- but joining a show later...
- Right.

2210
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,430
- did make me feel pressured.
- Right.

2211
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,790
That was why I wondered
how it would be.

2212
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,330
After the first shoot,

2213
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,400
my wife,
who was my girlfriend at that time,

2214
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,130
asked how the shoot was.

2215
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:22,970
"It felt comfortable as the members
treated me so well."

2216
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,640
I remember saying that to her.

2217
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:28,280
That is why I feel really grateful
to our members.

2218
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,280
It's the same for me.

2219
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,650
Even to the closest people
around me,

2220
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:34,380
I say that I'm closest to
the 2 Days and 1 Night members...

2221
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:35,950
- when I get asked who I'm close to.
- Me too.

2222
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,850
You guys are the only people...

2223
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:40,920
- that I share everything with.
- Right.

2224
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,160
We know all of your secrets.

2225
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,760
- We have no secrets between us.
- Right.

2226
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,960
How is it like this when we have
been together for just a year?

2227
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,230
You guys know a lot more about me
than the ones I've known for longer.

2228
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,860
It just naturally became like that.

2229
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,270
- It's because...
- You feel comfortable with us.

2230
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:54,330
We've been together for a year.

2231
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:57,340
- We have two shoots every month.
- Right.

2232
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,470
- Right.
- We've gathered 24 times.

2233
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:00,310
We've slept together
in the same place 24 times.

2234
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:03,080
- Right.
- Meeting someone 20 times a year...

2235
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,380
- is a really difficult thing.
- That never happens.

2236
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,650
- That never happens.
- Meeting someone 20 times a year?

2237
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,010
That's hard even for family members.

2238
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:08,220
Right.

2239
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:11,550
We find it hard to say things
that are cringy.

2240
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:13,490
We barely compliment each other too.

2241
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:14,560
But after looking through
the photo album,

2242
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,690
- I felt emotional.
- Exactly.

2243
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:17,360
When asked when we felt the happiest
throughout the year,

2244
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,060
you know how we weren't able
to answer each other, right?

2245
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,560
- Right.
- Looking through the photo album,

2246
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,260
- all the days felt happy.
- Right.

2247
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,200
I believe that...

2248
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:27,270
joy was a given for us...

2249
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,970
- because of these two.
- Right.

2250
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,700
- You're right.
- You're right.

2251
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,710
I couldn't think of anything
before looking through this.

2252
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:34,980
- But every day felt equally happy.
- Right.

2253
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,440
- I was surprised by that.
- Right.

2254
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,550
(Sae Ho can't take his eyes off
of the photo album.)

2255
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,850
You start speaking
from your heart voluntarily.

2256
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:43,250
Those things are always hard to say.

2257
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,790
- You said it was fine.
- Right.

2258
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,190
It was precise.

2259
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:48,390
What are you taking a picture of?

2260
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:50,890
No. Jong Min.

2261
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,130
(He's taking a picture of Jong Min.)

2262
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,860
- And...
- Gosh, even at this age,

2263
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,130
he's doing his best
to grab the money.

2264
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:00,930
(Passionate old member)

2265
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:04,000
All right. Shall we get some sleep
to fill up tomorrow?

2266
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,370
- Sure.
- Pictures of tomorrow.

2267
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:06,740
- Sure.
- Sure.

2268
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:09,480
No. This touching moment...

2269
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,910
can't end like this.

2270
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:12,180
Right. We should carry on
for two more hours.

2271
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:14,650
Right. We should carry on
for two more hours.

2272
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:17,050
He was taking pictures,
but I saw pictures of my wife.

2273
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:18,690
- I was surprised.
- I wondered why he had...

2274
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:20,350
pictures of my wife on his phone.

2275
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:23,090
(There was a big misunderstanding
after forgetting lending it to him.)

2276
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:24,990
I got so surprised.

2277
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:26,630
(Jong Min's phone)

2278
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,000
(A truly surprised face)

2279
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:31,600
(He couldn't believe his eyes.)

2280
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,570
- I couldn't believe it.
- Is this okay?

2281
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,370
He went through the pictures,
and I saw my wife.

2282
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,140
"But why?"

2283
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,940
I said that I was going to
take some pictures with your phone.

2284
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:41,840
This guy must really not listen
to what others say.

2285
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,210
- Let's go to bed.
- Right.

2286
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:45,280
- Let's go to bed.
- It's time to sleep.

2287
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,680
(The touching night ends
in a 2 Days and 1 Night fashion.)

2288
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:50,620
(The rain that will cool off
the heat through the night falls.)

2289
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:54,050
(Morning comes
drenched in rainwater.)

2290
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:59,790
(The members are still fast asleep
even when the sun is up.)

2291
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,400
(The wake-up song plays.)

2292
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:06,230
(Flinching)

2293
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:09,570
(They excitedly get up
to the exciting beat.)

2294
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:10,640
This is our song.

2295
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:12,910
- Right.
- I love the song.

2296
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:14,610
("Call Me" by KOYOTE)

2297
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:16,510
- It's "Call Me."
- Gosh.

2298
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:18,210
All right. The lights will come on.

2299
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:19,710
(Lights on)

2300
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,110
(Lights off)

2301
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:22,920
Okay.

2302
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:26,390
(Dancing)

2303
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:28,720
He's amazing.
He's dancing right after waking up.

2304
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,360
No, I mean...

2305
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,560
(He's amazing.)

2306
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:36,730
(He heads out first
with his overflowing energy.)

2307
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,800
(He cleans the sand in his eyes
like a cat.)

2308
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:43,800
- Hello.
- Welcome.

2309
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,210
- Did you sleep well?
- I did.

2310
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:49,040
(The others excitedly
head to the cafeteria.)

2311
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,980
(Dancing)

2312
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,180
They must be giving us food.

2313
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:56,820
(They all gather together.)

2314
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,290
You all slept well, right?

2315
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:00,590
- Yes.
- Yes.

2316
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:02,320
I got some good sleep.

2317
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,890
- The wake-up song was really nice.
- Right.

2318
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:06,490
(Call me)

2319
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:08,160
- You memorized it already.
- Right.

2320
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,130
Is it a Space A song?
Whose song is it?

2321
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,700
(It's KOYOTE's new song, "Call Me.")

2322
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:16,240
As it's the first anniversary
for Sae Ho and Joon,

2323
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:19,310
breakfast will be served
to everyone.

2324
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:20,970
- What?
- Why?

2325
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,210
- Don't do that.
- It's a special treat.

2326
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,640
That makes us feel
even more anxious.

2327
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:25,350
What? Gosh.

2328
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:26,580
Why be like that?

2329
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:28,720
Tripe soup or hangover soup.
Choose one.

2330
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:30,780
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2331
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,420
I'm being serious.

2332
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,420
Can we really choose one?

2333
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:35,660
- Yes.
- What?

2334
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,190
Can you bet your future on this?

2335
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:39,060
Why would I go that far?

2336
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,190
You should try doing that today.

2337
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,430
- It'll be fine.
- Even with your future on the line?

2338
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,300
- It's just free breakfast served?
- Really?

2339
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,800
- Yes.
- Gosh.

2340
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,770
Then I'll go for hangover soup.

2341
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:50,370
I'll have the tripe soup.

2342
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:51,510
- Without any games?
- I'll go for hangover soup.

2343
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:52,970
Hangover soup.
What about you, Seon Ho?

2344
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,210
- I'll go for hangover soup.
- Okay.

2345
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,350
- Is no one getting tripe soup?
- I am.

2346
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,850
- I'll go for hangover soup.
- Hangover soup.

2347
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:03,120
Five hangover soups
and one tripe soup.

2348
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,620
Sae Ho will get
dragged somewhere today.

2349
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:07,190
It's my fate
if I get dragged somewhere,

2350
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:09,320
but shouldn't I eat comfortably
as he said it will be fine?

2351
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:14,160
- I'll get hangover soup.
- Gosh.

2352
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,860
You can have the tripe soup.

2353
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:18,300
- One tripe soup...
- I'll have the tripe soup.

2354
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,330
and five hangover soups.

2355
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:21,570
Something feels off right now.

2356
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:23,470
He's giving up everything
if his future is on the line.

2357
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:25,540
But now that I think about it,
after feeding us,

2358
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:27,970
he could go,
"My future is over, to be honest."

2359
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,040
(Laughing)

2360
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,310
"Now that I think about it,
I am someone with no future."

2361
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:33,780
What could we say to that?

2362
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:35,080
"I live only for today."

2363
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,090
(Breakfast arrives
while teasing Director Joo.)

2364
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:39,950
- Gosh, it looks good.
- It's just served like this?

2365
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:41,350
It looks really good.

2366
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,720
Gosh, what is this?

2367
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,830
- I think it's beef hangover soup.
- What?

2368
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,330
I think it'll be good.

2369
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,130
- It looks amazing.
- It's beef hangover soup.

2370
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:51,830
I'm the only one with tripe soup.

2371
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:52,970
(Tripe soup with its
clean and rich taste)

2372
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:56,300
(He starts by taking a sip
of the soup.)

2373
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,370
Gosh, the soup is quite spicy.

2374
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,210
My gosh.

2375
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:04,910
(The soup tastes refreshing.)

2376
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:06,550
The soup tastes nice. Gosh.

2377
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:09,150
That must be nice
as it's new every time.

2378
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,190
Gosh, this is nice.

2379
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,590
Gosh, it's nice.

2380
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:15,220
- It's nice.
- This place serves great food.

2381
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,520
(A happy breakfast for everyone)

2382
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:19,790
It's free food.

2383
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,630
He called it free food.

2384
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,530
As it's free anyway,
ask if I can try the tripe soup too.

2385
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:26,570
(Whispering)

2386
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:28,800
Could we get one more tripe soup?

2387
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,540
Se Yoon asked if we could get
one more tripe soup...

2388
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:32,970
as it's free anyway.

2389
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,940
- Just to taste it.
- Gosh.

2390
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,780
- Sure.
- Of course.

2391
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:39,850
Gosh, why is another bowl served?

2392
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:41,680
It's really served.

2393
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:43,580
Why are they being like this?

2394
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,850
(Their kindness feels suspicious.)

2395
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,090
Why aren't you making us
do anything?

2396
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,890
Why are you just watching us?

2397
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:52,030
It's because you're eating.

2398
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:55,300
When will you tell us
what we're doing...

2399
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:56,600
after we're done eating?

2400
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:58,370
- The next activity?
- Yes.

2401
01:19:58,370 --> 01:19:59,870
Right now.

2402
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:01,800
Gosh, that was great timing.

2403
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,870
Perfect timing.

2404
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:05,670
You all enjoyed the food
that was served, right?

2405
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:08,140
Must we make up for our food?

2406
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:11,340
It has been a year...

2407
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:13,380
since these six members
have been together, right?

2408
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:16,320
To thank our viewers for their love
throughout the year...

2409
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:18,690
and to ask for
their continuous support,

2410
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:22,260
we are planning to promote our show
before getting off work.

2411
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:24,490
Where?

2412
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:26,460
We went to the amusement park
yesterday, right?

2413
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,830
Yes. Are we going there again?

2414
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:30,330
There will be a water festival.

2415
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,330
- Water?
- Yes.

2416
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:34,570
Our team will appear
at the last moment...

2417
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:35,940
as a surprise.

2418
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,010
The plan is to sing "Our Dream"
before getting off work.

2419
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:40,070
What?

2420
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:42,380
- "Our Dream?"
- None of us can sing that.

2421
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,180
- Shinji isn't here.
- What?

2422
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,780
I can't sing that song
without Shinji.

2423
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,420
- CG?
- Shinji.

2424
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:49,920
- CG?
- Shinji.

2425
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,980
(Laughing)

2426
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,550
It's not CG. It's Shinji.

2427
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,060
Why bring up CG all of a sudden?

2428
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,760
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2429
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,230
You didn't see his lips, did you?

2430
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:02,760
(The best at teasing Director Joo)

2431
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,830
His lips looked so funny.

2432
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:05,600
Shinji is needed for this song.

2433
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,670
Just like the WATERBOMB,

2434
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:09,100
Joon should take off his shirt.

2435
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,100
But...

2436
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,440
(I want to stop
taking off my shirt.)

2437
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,770
Of course. You must take off
your shirt for water festivals.

2438
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:14,770
You have to.

2439
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,780
Do this for "tough winds."
"Tough winds!"

2440
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:20,510
Gosh, no.

2441
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:21,980
That's a bit...

2442
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:24,520
"The tall waves!"
Tear up the buttons.

2443
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:25,920
- But...
- What does that have to do...

2444
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,720
- with "tough winds?"
- Since there are six of us,

2445
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,320
let's vote if we want Joon
to take off his shirt at that part.

2446
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,490
Close your eyes, everyone.

2447
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:32,560
Raise your hand
if you want that to happen.

2448
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,130
(We want his shirt to be taken off.)

2449
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,760
That's my best friend.

2450
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,300
I want him
to take off his pants too.

2451
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:41,570
(Trust is the mother of deceit.)

2452
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,940
He should be in just his underwear
for the water festival.

2453
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,670
Just his underwear.

2454
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:47,340
He should be in just his underwear
for the water festival.

2455
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:49,380
This is your chance.

2456
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,780
This is a special episode for you.

2457
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,320
You may finish up your meal first.

2458
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,620
We will practice
for the performance...

2459
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:59,650
- before heading out.
- Okay.

2460
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:01,550
- That will be the plan.
- Okay.

2461
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,020
(It's time to practice
after filling up their stomachs!)

2462
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:06,390
(Around 3 hours before
the performance)

2463
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:09,160
(The singers warm up
their voices first.)

2464
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,160
(Mooing)

2465
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,430
(Se Yoon warms up his voice
like a cow.)

2466
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:13,470
(Vocalizing)

2467
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,300
(Roaring)

2468
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:18,410
I'll do the highlight.

2469
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:20,470
- I heard this by chance
- Gosh, the notes are high.

2470
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,580
- During my childhood
- Gosh.

2471
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:23,840
- It was
- Gosh.

2472
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,850
This part sounds
great every single time.

2473
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:27,680
(Only Jong Min can sing this part.)

2474
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,650
I'll sing the 1st 2 lines.

2475
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,690
I have to check your tone.

2476
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,150
You should each take turns to sing.

2477
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:35,390
That first part?

2478
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:37,190
- How does this sound?
- Tell us.

2479
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,860
Jong Min will take the 1st 2 lines.

2480
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:42,130
Joon will take the next two lines.

2481
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:43,900
The next part...

2482
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:44,930
will be given to Joon.

2483
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,970
Sae Ho should try
the "tough winds" part.

2484
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:48,600
- Okay.
- Right.

2485
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:50,770
The second verse should start
with Seon Ho or DinDin.

2486
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:52,640
- Seon Ho or DinDin sings the part.
- Okay.

2487
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,740
Then I'll sing Shinji's part.

2488
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,710
I'll use the front teeth technique.
Like taking a short break.

2489
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,150
- Okay.
- Good idea.

2490
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,980
(Let's challenge together)

2491
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:04,380
We can sing together.

2492
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,820
- Showing the front teeth.
- Sing together.

2493
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:08,860
(An improvised duet
by the Front Teeth Brothers)

2494
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,230
(By holding each other's hands)

2495
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:16,160
(And collecting all our dreams)

2496
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:18,800
(Hitting high notes
with the front teeth)

2497
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,930
Good. That was nice.

2498
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:23,540
(Tough winds)

2499
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,640
(Tough winds)

2500
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,340
(A somewhat shocking voice)

2501
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:30,440
(Feeling dizzy)

2502
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:33,410
(The chorus
is sung by a husky voice.)

2503
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:34,980
It's not bad.

2504
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:37,280
(Really?)

2505
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,090
- Is it okay?
- I think you can sing the part.

2506
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:40,320
- Right.
- It's good.

2507
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,720
- It sounds good.
- You do sound tough.

2508
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:42,990
You can sing like that.

2509
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:44,320
The kids won't cry, will they?

2510
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,330
Is it okay?

2511
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:47,460
When we sing "tough winds,"

2512
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:49,160
why don't we try
some simple dance moves?

2513
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,260
Shall we do that?

2514
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:51,870
- Something like this.
- What?

2515
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:54,200
- Something cute.
- We can do something like this.

2516
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,100
- It says "tall waves," so...
- The vibe of waves.

2517
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,100
(Tough winds)

2518
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,140
Good.

2519
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:01,370
- Good.
- Like waves.

2520
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,440
- I like that.
- Okay.

2521
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,110
Can you do that while singing?

2522
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:07,310
(Tough winds)

2523
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:09,620
Of course, I can do that.

2524
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,250
Should we do things like this?

2525
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,750
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

2526
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,350
- That's a good one.
- Tall waves

2527
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:16,590
- Okay.
- Just as expected.

2528
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:18,960
One, two, three, four!

2529
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:22,960
(After assigning the parts
and working on the choreography,)

2530
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:27,470
(they continue
with intense practice.)

2531
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:30,740
- All our dreams
- All our dreams

2532
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:33,110
- Tough winds
- Good.

2533
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,040
(Doing their best
for the best performance)

2534
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,410
- Good.
- There you go.

2535
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:37,510
(Collecting)

2536
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:40,350
(Ripping)

2537
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,880
Together, 2 Days!

2538
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,380
- And 1 Night!
- And 1 Night!

2539
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:46,250
Okay. We will wash up and get ready.

2540
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:49,190
All right.
Let's show them what we've got.

2541
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:53,560
(Off to the venue)

2542
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,930
(Meanwhile,
at the venue in the amusement park)

2543
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,000
(Popping)

2544
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:03,670
(Living up to the nickname,
"Waterbomb Festival for Kids,")

2545
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:08,810
(about 200 people are here
to cool off from the hot summer.)

2546
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:13,750
(This is where
the members will perform.)

2547
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:16,750
(The water festival
has already begun.)

2548
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:19,450
(After driving for a while,)

2549
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:21,520
(they have neared the venue.)

2550
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,260
(15 minutes left)

2551
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:32,400
(The official event
is reaching its climax.)

2552
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:36,140
(The members are going backstage.)

2553
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:38,000
I'm excited
to be at a festival like this.

2554
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:44,840
(What they were most curious about
was the scale of the festival.)

2555
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:53,250
(It's bigger than I thought.)

2556
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:55,860
Be careful on the stairs
when you come out.

2557
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:58,790
(They have a brief meeting
about the route.)

2558
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:00,430
Sae Ho, you should go up first.
Our captain.

2559
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:02,460
Okay. Tough winds

2560
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:05,630
Everyone,
you know it's not over yet, right?

2561
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:06,830
(5 minutes left
before the surprise performance)

2562
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:10,870
(The members are waiting backstage.)

2563
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:14,210
All right. A round of applause!

2564
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,680
There are a lot of people.

2565
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:19,110
- It looks nice.
- There are so many people.

2566
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:20,650
- Gosh, what is this?
- What?

2567
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,620
There are too many people.

2568
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:24,020
I can't do this.

2569
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,950
This is totally different
from what I imagined.

2570
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:28,090
(Anxious)

2571
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:29,390
Let's see.

2572
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:32,760
(People think
this is the last song.)

2573
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:38,230
(Dancing)

2574
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:43,670
(Feeling nervous
in an unexpected situation)

2575
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:47,970
(Sae Ho looks quite serious too.)

2576
01:26:47,970 --> 01:26:50,280
