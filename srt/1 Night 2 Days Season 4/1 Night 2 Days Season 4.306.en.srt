1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:03,046
(The grand finale to 2025)

2
00:00:03,516 --> 00:00:06,485
(The Year-End Hardship Settlement Race)

3
00:00:06,486 --> 00:00:07,606
- We get paid?
- That's fun.

4
00:00:07,946 --> 00:00:10,285
(Get reimbursed...)

5
00:00:10,286 --> 00:00:12,156
(and increase the amount.)

6
00:00:12,556 --> 00:00:13,686
(At the end of the trip)

7
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,856
(Winter diving)

8
00:00:16,256 --> 00:00:18,226
(The scarily cold winter sea)

9
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:24,296
(Both teams fight hard...)

10
00:00:24,536 --> 00:00:27,506
(to get reimbursed.)

11
00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:28,836
Don't back out!

12
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:30,435
(Full forearm workout)

13
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:31,436
(Gained 50 cents)

14
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:33,906
(In the quiz to win more money, )

15
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:35,745
(Joon and Jong Min...)

16
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:37,246
(performed incredibly well.)

17
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,586
(Team Kim Jong Min won.)

18
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:43,586
(They swap what they have with the other team.)

19
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:45,455
(39 dollars 50 cents, 12 dollars)

20
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:47,386
(It was a disaster.)

21
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:50,526
(Meanwhile, Se Yoon and Seon Ho are on Gulseom.)

22
00:00:50,996 --> 00:00:53,195
(They shucked...)

23
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:55,536
(and shucked some more.)

24
00:00:56,636 --> 00:00:58,836
(Welcome to Gulseom.)

25
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:01,866
(They reconvene at the final location.)

26
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:05,156
(Who will be the last person this year to jump into the water?)

27
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:09,475
(2 Days 1 Night)

28
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:11,446
I'm just standing still and I feel cold.

29
00:01:11,816 --> 00:01:13,886
Where are Se Yoon and Seon Ho?

30
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:15,885
- They just arrived.
- Oh, really?

31
00:01:15,886 --> 00:01:18,286
- What happened?
- The sun's going down.

32
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:21,786
(They're too ashamed to face Seon Ho.)

33
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:24,226
- They're here.
- We're done for.

34
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:25,695
Is this where we dive in?

35
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:26,926
Hurry up!

36
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,196
Are you all right?

37
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:30,195
- Will you see my clothes?
- What?

38
00:01:30,196 --> 00:01:31,765
- We're just a bit dirty.
- What's this?

39
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:33,336
What's wrong? What happened?

40
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:35,106
- Oysters.
- Did something happen to you?

41
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,536
What's with your dirty pants?

42
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:38,806
- Well...
- You worked all this while?

43
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:41,105
(They won the honor...)

44
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:42,215
(to shuck oysters for money.)

45
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:43,316
(2.5 dollars for 100 grams)

46
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:45,146
(Seafood lover Seon Ho lost control...)

47
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:50,856
(and inhaled his oysters nonstop.)

48
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:55,525
(He filmed a joyous reimbursement eating show.)

49
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:57,496
- It's cold.
- The sea looks beautiful.

50
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:59,326
My hands hurt from all that shucking.

51
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:01,825
This is the last stop on our Year-End Hardship...

52
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:04,396
Settlement Race that follows the south coast.

53
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:07,165
This is Namhae-gun in South Gyeongsang Province.

54
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,606
- Namhae?
- Yes.

55
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:12,175
This is Sangju Silver Sand Beach,

56
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:14,176
the best-known beach on the coast.

57
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,015
(A beach covered in fine, silver sand...)

58
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:20,886
(with a lovely forest in the back.)

59
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:24,416
(Don't forget Namhae's amazing scenery.)

60
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:27,555
This is where we'll carry out the diving ceremony.

61
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:29,456
- "Diving ceremony."
- That sounds grand.

62
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:31,726
Okay, everyone.

63
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:34,696
I'll reveal your current amount.

64
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,465
(Clenched hands and a foodie)

65
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:37,766
Team No Pain No DinDin.

66
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:40,036
- You have 57 dollars.
- What?

67
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:42,706
Guys. I shucked and shucked oysters.

68
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:44,535
I worked quicker than an otter.

69
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:46,405
- What?
- I shucked and shucked.

70
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:47,966
- How much did you make?
- I shucked...

71
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:49,616
and I earned 17.5 dollars.

72
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:52,985
That is how much I made.

73
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:54,285
- We have over 50 now.
- Gosh.

74
00:02:54,286 --> 00:02:56,155
So, how much did you make, Seon Ho?

75
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:58,986
I get a feeling I'll be greatly rebuked.

76
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:00,625
- No.
- Let's see.

77
00:03:00,626 --> 00:03:02,395
- You tell us first.
- I guarantee you.

78
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:04,226
You'll rebuke them more, so tell them.

79
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:07,266
- No.
- You go first.

80
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:08,935
- Why this pose?
- Did we win?

81
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:10,376
Why are your hands behind your back?

82
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:12,095
What did you do while I was gone?

83
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:13,336
How much did I earn?

84
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:14,965
I have 8.75 dollars.

85
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:17,036
- You did really well, Se Yoon.
- Yes.

86
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:19,306
Team Kim Jong Min...

87
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:21,675
has 20.75 dollars.

88
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:25,116
(Team Kim Jong Min, 20.75 dollars)

89
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:26,746
Has 20.75 dollars.

90
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:31,016
No, wait. Time out.

91
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:33,185
We had 37 dollars.

92
00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:35,226
- What happened? You lost money?
- We won.

93
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:36,755
We didn't lose once.

94
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:38,125
- Only you...
- That's the truth.

95
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:39,195
Did your part well.

96
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:40,796
I was the smart one.

97
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:43,995
Yes. Joon kept telling me...

98
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:46,335
- we should swap.
- You're changing the story.

99
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:47,635
- Guess why we swapped.
- Why?

100
00:03:47,636 --> 00:03:48,836
We were curious.

101
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:50,976
(Laughing)

102
00:03:52,076 --> 00:03:53,775
- You'd want to know.
- They wouldn't tell.

103
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,175
Why won't they tell us anything?

104
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:57,315
- We wanted to know. We had to see!
- We were curious.

105
00:03:57,316 --> 00:03:58,316
(In disbelief)

106
00:03:58,317 --> 00:03:59,922
- That's crazy.
- Our curiosity was satisfied.

107
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:01,715
- They were curious.
- Not anymore.

108
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:03,286
This is the current situation.

109
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:06,425
This is where you'll take part in the last mission of the race.

110
00:04:06,426 --> 00:04:07,886
- What, there's more?
- Yes.

111
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:09,125
Please don't be disheartened.

112
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:10,795
- There's more?
- There's one more.

113
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:11,825
We'll win.

114
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:12,925
- Yes.
- Everyone.

115
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:14,225
Stand on either side of the cloth.

116
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:15,226
- The cloth?
- What's this?

117
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:16,235
What's this?

118
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:18,696
It's not over yet. I celebrated for no reason.

119
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:20,635
Uncover the cloth.

120
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,106
(The cloth is removed.)

121
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:23,776
What is this?

122
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:26,075
What is all this?

123
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,476
(What did they just see?)

124
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:30,446
The last mission is called...

125
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:34,916
Namhae Beach Transport.

126
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:37,155
You have six minutes...

127
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:39,056
to move as many tires...

128
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:40,655
and sandbags to your camp.

129
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,326
The team with more wins.

130
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:45,326
There are 150 sandbags that weigh 5kg each,

131
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:48,766
and 15 tires that weigh 10kg each.

132
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,135
After the time is up,

133
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:51,765
we'll calculate the difference in weight...

134
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:54,305
and pay the winning team...

135
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:55,936
fifty cents per extra kilogram.

136
00:04:56,736 --> 00:04:58,805
- You could throw up.
- I actually want to.

137
00:04:58,806 --> 00:04:59,905
(The last chance to win money.)

138
00:04:59,906 --> 00:05:02,675
Each sandbag weighs 5kg.

139
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:04,246
- It's 2.5 dollars.
- Yes.

140
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:06,785
- Just four equals ten dollars.
- That's right.

141
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:08,185
(10kg tire, 5 dollars)

142
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:10,816
We need ten more than them.

143
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:13,656
Right? We must move ten more than them.

144
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:15,026
Okay, everyone.

145
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:18,896
You start one-on-one, and after 100 seconds,

146
00:05:19,126 --> 00:05:20,825
- We swap?
- one more person goes in.

147
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:23,066
One person has to compete from start to finish?

148
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:24,436
- For six minutes?
- Yes.

149
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,465
- If nothing's left in the middle, - Yes?

150
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:28,536
You can steal from your opponents.

151
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:31,305
- Only once everything's gone?
- Only then.

152
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:32,575
- Not before then?
- No.

153
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:33,876
We won't back down.

154
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:36,875
This mission decides who goes diving,

155
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:39,585
so we prepared some items to assist you.

156
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,346
- What are they?
- Bring them in.

157
00:05:43,086 --> 00:05:44,355
Swim fins are a no.

158
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:46,926
What if we get refractive glasses or swim fins?

159
00:05:47,326 --> 00:05:49,455
- Do we buy them for the other team?
- Yes.

160
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:51,326
These are bad. You can't see a thing.

161
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:53,326
Oh, shoot.

162
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,026
These glasses...

163
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:56,966
- I feel dizzy.
- Okay.

164
00:05:57,436 --> 00:05:58,835
- First...
- Just one each.

165
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:00,435
- One of these.
- The refractive glasses.

166
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:01,666
Okay. Who are they for?

167
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:04,436
So he can ramp up his fashion sense...

168
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:05,846
Here you go.

169
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:07,445
Gosh, you guys.

170
00:06:07,446 --> 00:06:09,045
You need to try hard, though.

171
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:10,445
Hey, this feels weird.

172
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,345
(He can only see the ground.)

173
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:13,516
It's so weird.

174
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:15,786
This goes on Seon Ho's head.

175
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,486
- What?
- Stockings.

176
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,355
- Put it on.
- He has a small head,

177
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:20,556
so it might not work as well.

178
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:24,596
- There's space to spare.
- That's it.

179
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:25,966
Gosh.

180
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:27,966
You look a bit...

181
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,335
I'm pretty jealous.

182
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,766
- For Sae Ho.
- Why me?

183
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:34,266
I need to join the fight last.

184
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:35,765
(Swim fins)

185
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:36,835
Just a short try made me feel nauseous.

186
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:39,146
Here you go, Se Yoon. Swim fins.

187
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:41,505
Okay. It's our turn, right?

188
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:43,476
(Se Yoon must wear swim fins.)

189
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:46,285
Here are another pair of swim fins.

190
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:47,286
(Fine, give me them.)

191
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,646
- Yes.
- He knows.

192
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:50,855
I knew.

193
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:52,526
(The two aces are given swim fins.)

194
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:55,226
This is madness.

195
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:57,856
Why don't you start first?

196
00:06:58,196 --> 00:06:59,395
I'll join after 100 seconds.

197
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:01,195
I don't mind starting first at all,

198
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:02,596
but we need to think carefully.

199
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,365
I'll start.

200
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,006
- Can you manage?
- I think so.

201
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,335
See if you can run in those.

202
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:08,906
- Okay. I'll have a go.
- Yes.

203
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:12,676
It should be you.

204
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:14,675
(Even the swim fins can't stop him.)

205
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:15,676
Yes, good.

206
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:18,776
(Feels reassured)

207
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:21,616
Let's do this. Let's turn the tables.

208
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:24,056
Go to your camps!

209
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,356
DinDin.

210
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:28,126
- Is your zipper undone?
- It's not!

211
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:29,525
Sorry, my bad.

212
00:07:29,526 --> 00:07:31,256
Why do you keep bothering me?

213
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:33,026
It's so cold.

214
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,526
We'll die in the water.

215
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:36,665
It's getting colder.

216
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,935
(First in, DinDin and Joon)

217
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:38,936
(Second in, Se Yoon and Seon Ho)

218
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:40,205
The second and third participants...

219
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:41,905
must wait behind the squares!

220
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:43,146
(Third in, Sae Ho and Jong Min)

221
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:45,876
Here goes! Another person goes in after every 100 seconds!

222
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:47,776
Ready!

223
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:50,245
(A lot rests on the first participants' shoulders.)

224
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:52,446
(Can Team Kim Jong Min come back from behind?)

225
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:56,056
Go, Joon!

226
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:59,956
(The ace dashes out right away.)

227
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:03,555
(How well will DinDin do against Joon?)

228
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:05,795
(Joon's camera)

229
00:08:05,796 --> 00:08:07,766
(DinDin's camera)

230
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:09,096
Go!

231
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:10,435
(Plus 10kg, 10kg)

232
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:11,536
Show of strength.

233
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:14,866
(DinDin takes a surprising lead.)

234
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:16,306
Nice show of strength.

235
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:19,306
(Team No Pain No DinDin 20kg, Team Kim Jong Min 0)

236
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:22,046
(Joon goes for the sandbags.)

237
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:24,875
- Yes!
- You're doing good.

238
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:26,516
(Saved 25kg)

239
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:28,685
(During that time, DinDin...)

240
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:29,715
(got more tires.)

241
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:31,516
He's doing pretty well.

242
00:08:31,756 --> 00:08:34,656
- Oh, sorry.
- Put them down.

243
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:36,495
(The tires are heavier, )

244
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:37,595
(but they're easier to carry.)

245
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:39,396
Spread them out for him. Okay.

246
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:41,195
(Team No Pain No DinDin leads by obtaining the tires first.)

247
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:42,426
Good. That's a good strategy.

248
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:45,796
Spread them out on the ground. Okay.

249
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:48,005
(Carrying 4 5kg sandbags is the same as carrying 2 10kg tires.)

250
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:49,205
(Carrying 4 5kg sandbags is the same as carrying 2 10kg tires.)

251
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:51,736
(But sandbags are hard to carry.)

252
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:54,446
(Team Kim Jong Min: 45kg)

253
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:56,876
We might be better off carrying the tires. Joon.

254
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:58,775
Grabbing the tires might be better.

255
00:08:58,776 --> 00:08:59,986
(Only 9 tires remain now.)

256
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,415
Grabbing the tires might be better.

257
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,416
(Realizing his mistake)

258
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:05,086
- We should grab the tires.
- Grab the tires.

259
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,455
(He goes after the tires, rather late.)

260
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:10,095
- This is better.
- Yes, this is better.

261
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:11,096
(Team Kim Jong Min: 65kg)

262
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:13,366
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 80kg)

263
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:16,166
Let's grab all the tires first.

264
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:18,342
(At this rate, he might not end up with a lot of tires.)

265
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:19,635
There's only one left.

266
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:21,565
(He'll grab all three tires at once?)

267
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:22,635
(Lifting three tires at once)

268
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:23,675
- That's it.
- He's good.

269
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:24,876
- Great.
- He's good.

270
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:26,176
Great, Joon.

271
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:28,476
You got this! I can't see well.

272
00:09:28,906 --> 00:09:31,446
(The powerful ace tries to create a chance to take the lead.)

273
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:32,816
He's good.

274
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:34,315
- We're winning.
- Great.

275
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:35,815
- DinDin, you're great.
- It's been a minute!

276
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:36,816
- What did you say?
- It's been a minute.

277
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:37,855
A minute?

278
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:38,956
Gosh, I'm tired.

279
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:43,126
(Only the sandbags remain now.)

280
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:45,916
- We'll run out of them fast.
- We'll run out of them fast.

281
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,426
(Panting)

282
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:51,066
(Unlike DinDin who's getting tired...)

283
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:52,765
Gosh, Joon is carrying a lot.

284
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:54,536
My gosh. Let's go!

285
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:57,136
- When can we join him?
- At the 100-second mark.

286
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:59,305
Joon, you're doing a great job now.

287
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:01,476
- You're killing it.
- Joon, you're great.

288
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:03,745
DinDin, you're deciding the results of this game.

289
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:05,352
The first player's performance will affect the whole game.

290
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:06,545
- Three, - Let's go!

291
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:08,016
Two, one.

292
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,856
- Go!
- Good luck.

293
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:13,986
(A massive bottom)

294
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:17,456
(He sets out with a serious look on his face.)

295
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:19,226
Seon Ho, you must do your best.

296
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,996
Keep going back and forth. You must be quick.

297
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:24,096
Good luck.

298
00:10:24,097 --> 00:10:25,912
(The ace of Team No Pain No DinDin is on the move.)

299
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:27,365
Don't overdo it. Take your time.

300
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:28,912
Just bring a lot in one go. Take your time.

301
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:31,775
(Se Yoon grabs a whole bunch of sandbags.)

302
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:33,475
(Slipping)

303
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:36,116
(Brimming with greed)

304
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:38,075
You can take your time, Se Yoon. Don't run.

305
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:39,116
Okay.

306
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,645
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 230kg)

307
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:43,986
Seon Ho, you must help out more.

308
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:48,656
(Will Se Yoon be able to close the gap?)

309
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:50,195
(Team Kim Jong Min speeds up to turn the tables around.)

310
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:52,455
(Team Kim Jong Min: 330kg)

311
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:55,396
(Team Kim Jong Min: 350kg)

312
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,966
(They are gradually reaching their physical limit.)

313
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:03,106
(Everyone starts to slow down.)

314
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:07,506
(As DinDin was the 1st player, he's visibly more tired.)

315
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:10,445
(He can only move 3 sandbags at a time.)

316
00:11:10,446 --> 00:11:11,446
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 265kg)

317
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:13,285
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 280kg)

318
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:16,386
(The gap between the two teams begins to widen.)

319
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,456
(Someone is breathing heavily.)

320
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:26,056
(Joon, the ace, is tired too.)

321
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:27,996
Joon is tired. We must hurry.

322
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:30,536
(Is that so?)

323
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:32,395
(Se Yoon moves 6 sandbags at once.)

324
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:34,336
(Waddling)

325
00:11:34,536 --> 00:11:35,665
Hurry.

326
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,175
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 310kg, Team Kim Jong Min: 350kg)

327
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:39,546
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 325kg, Team Kim Jong Min: 370kg)

328
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:42,876
(In no time, the pile of sandbag is almost gone.)

329
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:45,245
Hey, this is tough.

330
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,086
(Se Yoon grabs 6 sandbags again.)

331
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:50,115
It's been three minutes.

332
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:53,055
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 355kg, Team Kim Jong Min: 370kg)

333
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:54,455
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 355kg, Team Kim Jong Min: 400kg)

334
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:55,985
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 355kg, Team Kim Jong Min: 420kg)

335
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:58,267
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 385kg, Team Kim Jong Min: 420kg)

336
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,526
- I might throw up.
- My neck hurts like crazy.

337
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:02,566
Players Three. Get ready.

338
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:05,936
Five, four,

339
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:08,966
three, two, one.

340
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:10,606
Go.

341
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:13,546
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

342
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:21,146
(The other members already took the rest of the sandbags.)

343
00:12:21,386 --> 00:12:24,356
(Fumbling)

344
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:26,785
(Are these the sandbags?)

345
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:27,786
(Screaming)

346
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:31,626
(Jong Min grabs three sandbags!)

347
00:12:31,926 --> 00:12:35,195
(On the other hand, Sae Ho is hesitant.)

348
00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:36,196
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 385kg, Team Kim Jong Min: 420kg)

349
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:37,835
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 385kg, Team Kim Jong Min: 440kg)

350
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:40,436
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 420kg, Team Kim Jong Min: 440kg)

351
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,836
Jong Min, go after their stuff now.

352
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:45,112
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 385kg, Team Kim Jong Min: 475kg)

353
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:48,846
(Joon takes the last sandbag.)

354
00:12:49,046 --> 00:12:50,515
- Can we start now?
- Hey, mister.

355
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,245
Yes. You can steal each other's sandbags and tires now.

356
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:53,492
(The middle section is empty now.)

357
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:57,016
(They can now steal each other's sandbags and tires.)

358
00:12:57,456 --> 00:12:59,737
(They must steal as many sandbags and tires as they can.)

359
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:01,126
Hey, mister.

360
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:03,295
(Spotting his chance to steal)

361
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:04,926
- You can't do that.
- Come on.

362
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:08,666
(DinDin steals Team Kim Jong Min's tires.)

363
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:13,865
(Joon blocks DinDin with his whole body.)

364
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:15,335
(But his grip gets loose.)

365
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,436
I'm so dizzy.

366
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:19,005
(DinDin manages to steal 20kg.)

367
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,445
(The tires are being moved back and forth.)

368
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:22,446
(Seon Ho)

369
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:23,776
Seon Ho. Run!

370
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:26,516
(I'm going to steal them too.)

371
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:29,446
(Se Yoon approaches Team Kim Jong Min's pile.)

372
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,786
(Shocking)

373
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:39,766
(Se Yoon tosses their tires away.)

374
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,766
(Team Kim Jong Min is losing 10kg per tire.)

375
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:46,335
(Se Yoon's strategy is to reduce their weight.)

376
00:13:46,336 --> 00:13:47,466
Protect ours.

377
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:50,346
(But Team No Pain No DinDin is facing the same problem.)

378
00:13:51,136 --> 00:13:52,805
Go and protect yours.

379
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:53,806
(Tossing)

380
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:57,145
(The sandbags are getting pulled away like radishes.)

381
00:13:57,146 --> 00:14:00,046
(Stop it.)

382
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,485
(Tossing)

383
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:05,686
(Seon Ho moves quickly.)

384
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,355
(He's faster than Se Yoon at reducing the weight.)

385
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:09,356
(He's faster than Se Yoon at reducing the weight.)

386
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:12,855
(I must get rid of 1kg more.)

387
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,765
You have ten seconds left.

388
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,566
(10 seconds until time's up)

389
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:21,506
(Struggling to steal at least 1kg more)

390
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,835
Hey, I'm so dizzy.

391
00:14:22,836 --> 00:14:24,636
(Throwing himself to protect their pile)

392
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:27,475
(Those who want to protect their pile...)

393
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:30,116
Five, four, three,

394
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:32,276
two, one.

395
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:34,985
(Time's up.)

396
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:36,046
That's it.

397
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:39,856
(I gave it my all.)

398
00:14:40,056 --> 00:14:42,756
(They don't even have energy to get up.)

399
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:43,956
(Exhausted)

400
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:45,096
I'm so dizzy!

401
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:49,126
(Team No Pain No DinDin, Team Kim Jong Min)

402
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:51,696
Having a good strategy was crucial at the end.

403
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:53,836
- Right.
- It never crossed my mind.

404
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:56,066
DinDin. How did I do?

405
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:57,475
(A thumbs-up)

406
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:59,075
- You were amazing.
- I was pretty smart today, right?

407
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:00,476
- You killed it.
- Right?

408
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:02,205
- Gosh.
- Throwing them away was the answer.

409
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:03,876
Yes. That was the right strategy.

410
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:06,416
Everyone, we're going to count now.

411
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:09,545
Could you all stand...

412
00:15:09,546 --> 00:15:11,255
behind your pile?

413
00:15:11,256 --> 00:15:12,662
(They'll be paid 50 cents for every 1kg difference.)

414
00:15:12,686 --> 00:15:15,426
Each tire counts as 10kg, right?

415
00:15:15,826 --> 00:15:17,996
Let's remove one tire at a time.

416
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:19,825
One.

417
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:23,295
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 1 tire, Team Kim Jong Min: 1 tire)

418
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:24,365
Two.

419
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:27,136
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 2 tires, Team Kim Jong Min: 2 tires)

420
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:29,336
- Three.
- Three.

421
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:31,876
- I think we have more.
- We do.

422
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:33,476
I think we have more.

423
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:36,246
- You threw away a lot.
- That was the right move.

424
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:38,706
- Hey, that was a good strategy.
- Yes.

425
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:40,316
- Here.
- Three.

426
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,446
Both teams have three tires.

427
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:43,815
Gosh, we could've had more.

428
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:44,955
(They're tied with 3 tires for now.)

429
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:46,756
I think they have a lot of sandbags. Darn it.

430
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:48,826
Let's do five bags.

431
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:50,855
Can you move these?

432
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:52,456
- Keep going until we have five.
- Yes.

433
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:53,726
No.

434
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:54,996
- Okay.
- Yes.

435
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:56,846
- Give me next set of five, please.
- Okay.

436
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:58,496
Twenty for them too.

437
00:15:58,636 --> 00:15:59,735
Thirty-three.

438
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:01,106
- Thirty-five.
- You guys too.

439
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,536
- They have a lot more.
- Give me five more.

440
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:06,336
We might lose by a close margin.

441
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:08,946
They might win.

442
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:11,015
Five more?

443
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:13,346
(Both teams are struggling to predict the outcomes.)

444
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:14,745
This could be anyone's game!

445
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:16,026
(Se Yoon grabs the last 2 bags.)

446
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:17,755
(Team No Pain No DinDin has a total of 47 bags.)

447
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:19,085
Exclude the last two.

448
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:21,386
(Please let us win.)

449
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,826
How many do you have left?

450
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:26,596
Two. One, two.

451
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,266
Three.

452
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,065
That's a huge difference.

453
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,436
It could be anyone's game!

454
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,006
We won!

455
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,942
- So 50 cents per 1kg?
- We beat them at the last minute.

456
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:37,176
- So 50 cents per 1kg?
- Yes.

457
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:40,446
So 50 cents per 1kg?

458
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:42,745
That means it's 2.5 dollars per bag. That's a huge gap.

459
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:43,945
(A 5kg bag would yield 2.5 dollars.)

460
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:45,746
(The number of extra bags will be important.)

461
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:48,816
- That's 16 bags.
- You have 16 bags left?

462
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:50,155
(So 80 times 50 cents is...)

463
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:51,215
That's 80kg.

464
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:52,956
- That's 40 dollars.
- It's 40 dollars.

465
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:55,432
- Hey, this is amazing.
- What just happened?

466
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:56,925
Did we beat them or what? What happened?

467
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:58,525
- We must calculate it.
- Hey.

468
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:00,406
We might have a chance to win. What's going on?

469
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:02,676
I told you not to give up. See? We could do it.

470
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:05,672
- Team No Pain No DinDin...
- They had 50-something dollars.

471
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:07,406
Has 52.9 dollars.

472
00:17:07,636 --> 00:17:08,765
We have 52.9 dollars.

473
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:10,782
- You have 52.9 dollars.
- That's our current balance?

474
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:12,005
Team Kim Jong Min...

475
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:13,526
(Team Kim Jong Min earned 40 dollars.)

476
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:15,646
has 56.65 dollars.

477
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:17,345
We beat them at the end.

478
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:19,715
- Team Kim Jong Min is winning.
- We did it.

479
00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:21,715
All right. See? We can't give up on this show.

480
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:22,892
Right. We must try to the end.

481
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,015
Hard work pays off.

482
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:25,285
(52.9 dollars versus 56.65 dollars)

483
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:26,315
All right.

484
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:28,385
- It's a four-dollar difference.
- It's not a big gap.

485
00:17:28,386 --> 00:17:29,585
- If you didn't switch earlier, - Earlier...

486
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:30,725
- it would've been crazy.
- Right.

487
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:32,332
- We would've had a big gap.
- I bet we had a fortune then.

488
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:34,025
I told you having more money...

489
00:17:34,026 --> 00:17:35,465
- would be advantageous for you.
- Yes.

490
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:36,706
Wait. Is it the spinning wheel?

491
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:38,426
- Okay.
- It's the spinning wheel?

492
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:39,936
What is this? It's a random draw.

493
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:41,605
- If I knew it'd be a random draw, - Okay.

494
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:43,605
I would've had two more oysters.

495
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:44,876
It's all about luck.

496
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:46,876
It's all up to our luck.

497
00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:49,445
Guys, the highlight of our show...

498
00:17:49,446 --> 00:17:50,945
- is the random draw.
- That's right!

499
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,776
- Okay.
- It's all up to our luck.

500
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:55,115
You can trade your money...

501
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,715
- the money with the lottery balls.
- Okay.

502
00:17:56,716 --> 00:17:58,515
Each lottery ball...

503
00:17:58,516 --> 00:18:00,455
- is 2.5 dollars.
- Okay.

504
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:01,725
Team No Pain No DinDin...

505
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:03,355
- can have 21 balls.
- We have 21 balls.

506
00:18:03,356 --> 00:18:05,595
- Team Kim Jong Min...
- How much money do we have?

507
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:06,766
- We have 22.
- can have 22.

508
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:08,425
- The difference is only one ball.
- Yes.

509
00:18:08,426 --> 00:18:09,626
Well, it's anyone's game then.

510
00:18:09,726 --> 00:18:13,036
The team who wins the random draw...

511
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,065
- They'll go into the water?
- won't have to go into the water.

512
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:16,605
- They won't have to?
- They're the winners.

513
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:18,375
- I see. It will decide everything?
- To win, you must win the draw.

514
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:19,376
- Yes.
- My gosh.

515
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:20,505
- We just need to be lucky once.
- This is pretty tough.

516
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:21,775
This is crazy. It's a big one.

517
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:23,975
- It's all up to our luck.
- We'll put in the balls.

518
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:25,016
Let's do this.

519
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,245
Joon, you put them in. You're killing it today.

520
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:28,985
You counted the balls correctly, right?

521
00:18:28,986 --> 00:18:30,785
- Come and count.
- The police officers must be...

522
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:32,616
present during the lottery draw.

523
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:34,925
(Se Yoon wants to count them.)

524
00:18:34,926 --> 00:18:36,185
- That's ours.
- Don't touch them.

525
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:37,955
- Don't touch me - Don't touch them.

526
00:18:37,956 --> 00:18:39,395
- Don't touch them.
- I'll put...

527
00:18:39,396 --> 00:18:41,172
- Team Kim Jong Min's balls first.
- Twenty-one.

528
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:43,436
- Eighteen.
- What are you doing?

529
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:45,676
(Team No Pain No DinDin's balls)

530
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:47,806
(He openly cheats after everything he said.)

531
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:49,335
They're sensitive.

532
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,706
(Laughing)

533
00:18:51,536 --> 00:18:53,075
(At that moment...)

534
00:18:53,076 --> 00:18:54,506
Can you check Jong Min's pockets?

535
00:18:56,946 --> 00:18:58,015
Oh, no.

536
00:18:58,016 --> 00:18:59,246
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

537
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:02,486
- Can we check your pockets?
- Why?

538
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:03,816
Wait.

539
00:19:03,817 --> 00:19:05,055
- What?
- What?

540
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,886
- Hold on.
- Have you lost your mind?

541
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:09,155
- We won't let it slide.
- Why?

542
00:19:09,156 --> 00:19:10,495
- Where is it?
- This isn't going to be funny.

543
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:11,926
- We won't laugh it off.
- What?

544
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:14,125
- I guess you were wrong.
- What?

545
00:19:14,126 --> 00:19:15,566
What do you mean? Who was it?

546
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:17,565
Who accused me of stealing?

547
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:18,995
(Who made a false accusation?)

548
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:20,665
- Who was it?
- No, it was nothing.

549
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,665
- I need to catch him.
- This kind of thing happens.

550
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,505
- So he suspected you.
- How dare he suspect me?

551
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:26,136
(How dare he suspect me?)

552
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:27,546
I'm sorry.

553
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:30,675
- Be nice to people.
- Am I that bad?

554
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:31,776
(Did I disappoint you?)

555
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:34,016
- Shall we begin now?
- Yes.

556
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,385
Director Hyun Woo will do the draw.

557
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:38,115
- Our team name has to be on it.
- We can do this.

558
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:39,216
We can do this.

559
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:41,125
- We can do it.
- If it's our name, we're free.

560
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:42,886
I don't think it will be us. Don't worry.

561
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,156
I'm not worried.

562
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:46,425
- I believe in Joon.
- I don't even believe it.

563
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:47,725
- I'm just watching. That's it.
- Okay.

564
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:48,865
If our name is on it, we can just go into the water.

565
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:50,095
If not, they'll do it.

566
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:51,395
- We've been winning the whole day.
- We'll begin.

567
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:52,765
- Let's go.
- It's 50-50.

568
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:54,265
The odds are pretty much even.

569
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:55,936
- Let's begin the draw.
- Please.

570
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:57,336
- Our...
- Gosh.

571
00:19:58,076 --> 00:19:59,175
Hyun Woo.

572
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:00,905
- Spin them a little more.
- Please keep spinning them.

573
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:02,876
- Please. Is it going to come up?
- One more.

574
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:04,645
Please! Today...

575
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:05,975
- Should I do it now?
- No.

576
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:07,445
It will be the last dive of the year.

577
00:20:07,446 --> 00:20:08,986
(It's hard to watch.)

578
00:20:09,286 --> 00:20:11,155
(A heart-stopping moment)

579
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:12,315
- Please.
- Ten seconds.

580
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:13,425
- There it goes.
- Ten seconds.

581
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:14,685
- Let's all count together.
- I can't watch.

582
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:16,796
- Go. Ten, nine, - Ten, nine,

583
00:20:17,156 --> 00:20:18,456
- eight, seven, - eight, seven,

584
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:21,066
- six, five, four, - six, five, four,

585
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:23,536
- three, two, one.
- three, two, one.

586
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:24,996
- Let's go.
- That's it.

587
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,965
- Grab it.
- Okay.

588
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:28,006
Hold on.

589
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:31,105
(The ball has been chosen.)

590
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,475
Hold on. Director Hyun Woo.

591
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:33,675
(The ball has to say...)

592
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:35,605
(the name of our team.)

593
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:37,620
Just like that. Hurry up and say it like on "Immortal Songs."

594
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:38,813
That's how it will be done.

595
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,143
- This team won't have to dive.
- Like that.

596
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:41,483
- They won't have to dive.
- Whoever is picked won't have to.

597
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:42,953
- It's either us or them.
- I...

598
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:43,983
Please.

599
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:45,784
Go ahead and announce it.

600
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,200
- They have to do it, not us.
- Which team survived the mission?

601
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:49,284
Announce it.

602
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:50,954
- I'll announce it.
- Do it!

603
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:53,824
- The surviving team is...
- Tell us!

604
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:56,294
Team No Pain...

605
00:20:57,494 --> 00:20:58,763
- It's Team Kim Jong Min!
- Yes!

606
00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:00,503
(Team Kim Jong Min is exempted from going into the water.)

607
00:21:00,504 --> 00:21:01,564
I can't believe this!

608
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:03,214
- It's Team Kim Jong Min!
- Yes!

609
00:21:04,374 --> 00:21:06,033
(This is amazing!)

610
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,174
This is crazy.

611
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:08,673
- It's Team Kim Jong Min!
- Yes!

612
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:11,214
(Team Kim Jong Min is exempted from going into the water.)

613
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:13,343
(We're the winners!)

614
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:14,713
- I told you we got this!
- My gosh.

615
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:15,994
- It's Team Kim Jong Min!
- Yes!

616
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:19,523
(Team No Pain No DinDin will have to dive into the water.)

617
00:21:19,524 --> 00:21:21,453
- I told you, didn't I?
- We actually won?

618
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,423
- I can't believe this.
- We actually won?

619
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:25,344
(An unbelievable turnaround for the losing team)

620
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:27,764
(After switching the envelopes, )

621
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:31,194
(they thought they were doomed.)

622
00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:34,063
(But as they didn't give up...)

623
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:38,204
(and with incredible determination, )

624
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:44,344
(they finally won!)

625
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:47,013
We did it because we didn't give up.

626
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,313
I told you we could do it.

627
00:21:48,314 --> 00:21:50,530
Everyone, you can totally turn the tables around at the end.

628
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:52,253
- Gosh, I can't believe this.
- I told you not to give up.

629
00:21:52,254 --> 00:21:53,384
Just do it.

630
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:56,083
- Seriously.
- We really did it.

631
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:57,393
- This is crazy.
- Hey.

632
00:21:57,394 --> 00:21:59,593
- Guys.
- It paid off even more.

633
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:01,763
Let's begin the diving ceremony.

634
00:22:01,764 --> 00:22:03,763
- Let's go.
- Please get ready.

635
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:05,134
- This is crazy.
- Go and dive.

636
00:22:05,564 --> 00:22:06,964
(Sighing)

637
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:09,034
- It's right in front of you.
- Gosh.

638
00:22:09,574 --> 00:22:11,133
(They move the Jimmy Jib to film the diving ceremony.)

639
00:22:11,134 --> 00:22:12,573
Keep walking straight.

640
00:22:12,574 --> 00:22:14,073
- Let's keep walking straight.
- Keep going.

641
00:22:14,074 --> 00:22:15,103
Film this.

642
00:22:15,104 --> 00:22:17,214
- I'm filming it now.
- Did you get it?

643
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:19,013
Let's do it down there.

644
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:21,614
(Everything is fun now that he's exempted from diving.)

645
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:25,084
This is too close. Do we have to move down more?

646
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:27,084
- Lower it?
- Lower it.

647
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:28,953
(He's having fun bossing them around.)

648
00:22:28,954 --> 00:22:30,693
Should we lower it? Did you put it down?

649
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:33,123
- Sae Ho.
- I'll put it down too.

650
00:22:33,124 --> 00:22:35,004
- I'll put it down.
- Yes, you can put it down.

651
00:22:35,864 --> 00:22:37,933
Let me go and check the temperature of the water.

652
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:38,993
(Staying busy)

653
00:22:38,994 --> 00:22:40,503
I bet it's really cold.

654
00:22:40,504 --> 00:22:42,544
(All of a sudden, he checks the water temperature.)

655
00:22:44,234 --> 00:22:47,143
(Screaming in pain)

656
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:48,344
Gosh, it's cold.

657
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:50,264
Gosh. How are they going to do it?

658
00:22:51,174 --> 00:22:52,774
- This is too harsh.
- Are you for real?

659
00:22:53,044 --> 00:22:54,144
It's freezing.

660
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,054
Jong Min really knows how to rub it in. My gosh.

661
00:22:57,854 --> 00:23:00,683
(He can only smile.)

662
00:23:00,684 --> 00:23:02,354
The water will be cold.

663
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:05,923
(And this guy is annoyed at Director Joo.)

664
00:23:05,924 --> 00:23:08,223
(Chuckling)

665
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:09,893
Hey, I was with James Cameron...

666
00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:11,594
- only three days ago.
- Really?

667
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:14,234
I took a selfie with James Cameron.

668
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:15,664
That was just three days ago.

669
00:23:16,204 --> 00:23:17,833
(James Cameron, born in 1954)

670
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:19,503
(Director of "The Terminator," "Titanic," and "Avatar")

671
00:23:19,504 --> 00:23:22,774
(A dreamlike meeting with a world-class director)

672
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:27,984
(His reality now is he must dive into the winter sea.)

673
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:32,583
(Se Yoon warms up diligently too.)

674
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:33,654
It's so cold.

675
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:38,224
(Off to the freezing-cold sea)

676
00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:40,024
It's all about getting good energy.

677
00:23:40,064 --> 00:23:42,794
Think of it as a way to ward off bad luck for the year.

678
00:23:43,094 --> 00:23:44,933
Accept the new year, 2026.

679
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:46,133
(Warming up in a desperate attempt to stay alive)

680
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,464
Ward off any bad luck.

681
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,663
(It's understandable as it's cold enough to see their breath.)

682
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:49,904
No. Let's do it.

683
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:51,703
- All right.
- Are you ready?

684
00:23:51,704 --> 00:23:53,143
The three of us should go in together. That's only fair.

685
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:54,144
Let's do this.

686
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,074
- Gosh, it must be so cold.
- All right.

687
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,173
- Guys.
- Okay.

688
00:23:58,174 --> 00:23:59,313
Thank you for your hard work.

689
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,543
- Good luck.
- Good job!

690
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:02,183
The last dive of the year!

691
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:04,984
Guys, may only happy occasions fill your 2026!

692
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:06,683
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

693
00:24:06,684 --> 00:24:07,924
(The colleagues root for them.)

694
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:09,954
(The youngest captures the moment.)

695
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:11,204
I'm a thoughtful celebrity!

696
00:24:14,164 --> 00:24:16,834
(Se Yoon steps back, startled by the water temperature.)

697
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:19,434
- Did you go in?
- Yes.

698
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:21,003
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

699
00:24:21,004 --> 00:24:22,104
Hey, wait up.

700
00:24:22,634 --> 00:24:24,134
- Give me your hand.
- Hurry up.

701
00:24:24,374 --> 00:24:25,534
It's so cold.

702
00:24:25,704 --> 00:24:28,074
(They hold hands once again.)

703
00:24:28,604 --> 00:24:33,543
(Team No Pain No DinDin moves forward one step at a time.)

704
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:34,683
All right.

705
00:24:34,684 --> 00:24:36,484
- Seriously.
- Leave behind 2025!

706
00:24:37,654 --> 00:24:39,514
(They're amazing.)

707
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:43,123
(The only thing that remains now is to dive in.)

708
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:45,123
- All right.
- Hurry up.

709
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:46,463
Thank you...

710
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:48,394
for supporting our show in 2025.

711
00:24:48,594 --> 00:24:51,694
I hope I can count on your support for 2026 too.

712
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,133
- All right.
- 2 Days...

713
00:24:53,134 --> 00:24:54,134
- 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

714
00:24:54,135 --> 00:24:55,264
Let's go!

715
00:24:58,074 --> 00:25:00,004
(Amazed)

716
00:25:00,774 --> 00:25:02,974
(After powerfully shouting out his message...)

717
00:25:03,214 --> 00:25:05,074
- 1 Night! Let's go!
- 1 Night!

718
00:25:05,614 --> 00:25:07,483
(Diving in)

719
00:25:07,484 --> 00:25:08,484
Let's go!

720
00:25:08,814 --> 00:25:11,584
(A clean dive...)

721
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:12,914
Let's go!

722
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:15,153
(to wrap up 2025!)

723
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:16,184
My gosh.

724
00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:17,593
Let's go!

725
00:25:17,594 --> 00:25:19,423
(Impressed)

726
00:25:19,424 --> 00:25:20,564
Let's go!

727
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:24,633
(You know what, though?)

728
00:25:24,634 --> 00:25:25,634
Oh, no.

729
00:25:25,635 --> 00:25:26,795
(The water is freezing cold!)

730
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:29,664
(Screaming)

731
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:31,633
(Running out as soon as diving in)

732
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:32,674
- It's so cold.
- My gosh.

733
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,194
(You can see how cold it is just by looking at them.)

734
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:38,214
What's going on? What are they doing?

735
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:40,154
You guys looked so cool when you dove in.

736
00:25:40,944 --> 00:25:43,344
(Forget about looking cool. We're about to freeze to death.)

737
00:25:45,614 --> 00:25:47,853
Hurry up. Just spread the towel.

738
00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:49,283
- I want the blanket.
- Hurry.

739
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:50,393
The blanket.

740
00:25:50,394 --> 00:25:52,794
- Hurry up. It's so cold.
- I want a blanket too.

741
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,993
(Here comes the blanket, Sae Ho.)

742
00:25:54,994 --> 00:25:56,324
It's so cold.

743
00:25:56,994 --> 00:25:58,364
Give it to me.

744
00:25:58,594 --> 00:26:00,304
All right. Everyone.

745
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:01,833
- Are you okay?
- It's over?

746
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,180
(They almost lose their mind after taking a dip in the sea.)

747
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:05,934
Are you that cold?

748
00:26:07,944 --> 00:26:09,584
Why do you have a blanket over your body?

749
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:12,444
- Here you go.
- Gosh.

750
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:15,664
Make it look like you edited out my diving clip.

751
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:20,454
(The ones who actually went into the water are speechless.)

752
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:22,253
- Are you okay?
- I was with James Cameron...

753
00:26:22,254 --> 00:26:24,024
only three days ago.

754
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:28,594
(Forget about Hollywood now.)

755
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:30,633
- You guys were great.
- Gosh, it was cold.

756
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:31,794
You were so cool.

757
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:34,134
- Gosh, it's cold.
- Really?

758
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,733
(They're speechless after going into the water.)

759
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:41,573
- Are you okay?
- My gosh, it felt good.

760
00:26:41,574 --> 00:26:43,104
- Really?
- Actually,

761
00:26:43,544 --> 00:26:44,813
it washed away my fatigue.

762
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:45,913
Really?

763
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:47,113
(That's amazing.)

764
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:48,283
They must be so awake now.

765
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:49,783
- Seriously.
- I might pass out in three minutes.

766
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:50,813
(I was lying.)

767
00:26:50,814 --> 00:26:51,814
Right.

768
00:26:51,815 --> 00:26:54,124
We had to run in the morning too. Right?

769
00:26:54,854 --> 00:26:56,554
- Today was tough.
- Gosh.

770
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:59,670
- I can't believe you guys won.
- Right. I can't believe it either.

771
00:26:59,694 --> 00:27:01,494
It wasn't about going into the water.

772
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:03,193
I can't believe we actually won...

773
00:27:03,194 --> 00:27:04,293
- That's crazy, right?
- at the last minute.

774
00:27:04,294 --> 00:27:06,093
I've been on the show for four years.

775
00:27:06,094 --> 00:27:08,054
It gave me the biggest dopamine rush for winning.

776
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:10,673
I thought my heart was going to explode.

777
00:27:10,674 --> 00:27:11,804
Right? It was crazy earlier.

778
00:27:12,574 --> 00:27:16,004
(They arrive at the base camp.)

779
00:27:16,944 --> 00:27:19,143
(They take a short break while warming their bodies.)

780
00:27:19,144 --> 00:27:20,644
- Are you guys resting up?
- Yes.

781
00:27:21,144 --> 00:27:22,813
- It's the end of the year.
- Right.

782
00:27:22,814 --> 00:27:24,214
These are the letters,

783
00:27:24,614 --> 00:27:26,884
- addressed to our show.
- I see.

784
00:27:27,054 --> 00:27:28,883
- Really?
- The viewers sent us letters.

785
00:27:28,884 --> 00:27:29,994
- Gosh.
- I see.

786
00:27:30,094 --> 00:27:31,453
- Gosh.
- Hey, these letters...

787
00:27:31,454 --> 00:27:33,123
- This is touching.
- We have to read them.

788
00:27:33,124 --> 00:27:34,894
- I didn't know people sent letters.
- Gosh.

789
00:27:35,194 --> 00:27:36,634
I'm so grateful.

790
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:40,664
We selected a few from many letters.

791
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,303
There's also a letter from abroad.

792
00:27:43,304 --> 00:27:44,733
- From Poland?
- It's from Poland.

793
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:46,004
- Poland?
- Let me see it.

794
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:47,743
- Could you read it out loud?
- I see.

795
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:50,614
"2 Days 1 Night."

796
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:53,074
- Is it written in English?
- Yes.

797
00:27:54,684 --> 00:27:58,214
"You gentlemen are amazing."

798
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:00,724
(Hesitating)

799
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:02,854
(Quietly)

800
00:28:03,494 --> 00:28:04,953
(That's as far as I can go.)

801
00:28:04,954 --> 00:28:06,923
What? What's wrong?

802
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:08,564
(We knew it.)

803
00:28:08,724 --> 00:28:09,724
Let me take a look.

804
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:11,934
If it's too hard, I'll pass it to someone else.

805
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:16,504
"You gentlemen are amazing entertainers."

806
00:28:17,474 --> 00:28:19,634
You gentlemen.

807
00:28:20,044 --> 00:28:21,273
You're very amazing...

808
00:28:21,274 --> 00:28:23,143
- You don't have to translate that.
- Okay.

809
00:28:23,144 --> 00:28:24,543
What's wrong with you?

810
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:26,614
"Your show makes my day..."

811
00:28:27,114 --> 00:28:28,143
Okay.

812
00:28:28,144 --> 00:28:29,984
"every single time."

813
00:28:30,754 --> 00:28:33,824
"With best greetings from Poland..."

814
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:37,554
- Poland?
- "to you and your families."

815
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:40,293
Does this show get aired in Poland?

816
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:41,764
- Does it get aired?
- On KBS WORLD.

817
00:28:41,964 --> 00:28:43,463
On KBS WORLD?

818
00:28:43,464 --> 00:28:44,894
That's amazing.

819
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:47,833
- We have many from children.
- Seriously.

820
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,994
- Children also wrote to us.
- Some are from children.

821
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,504
That's so cute.

822
00:28:52,204 --> 00:28:53,604
This is adorable.

823
00:28:54,004 --> 00:28:57,614
(Warm words from children)

824
00:28:58,374 --> 00:29:00,214
Look, isn't it so cute?

825
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:02,313
- It was drawn...
- "2 Days 1 Night."

826
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:04,013
- by a child.
- "Mr. Lee Joon."

827
00:29:04,014 --> 00:29:06,453
Each student in the same class at the elementary school...

828
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:08,383
- wrote a letter and made a drawing.
- Really?

829
00:29:08,384 --> 00:29:09,923
It's written to Se Yoon.

830
00:29:09,924 --> 00:29:12,524
(The members' 1 year captured through the eyes of children)

831
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:15,523
- "Lee Joon, 2 Days 1 Night."
- That's so cute.

832
00:29:15,524 --> 00:29:16,764
- Here it is.
- "Moon Se Yoon."

833
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,594
It says, "I'm getting married."

834
00:29:19,794 --> 00:29:20,864
Yes.

835
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:23,134
Someone drew me when I announced my marriage.

836
00:29:23,264 --> 00:29:24,904
- Isn't it nice?
- It's so cute.

837
00:29:25,874 --> 00:29:31,144
(A group performance at the Waterbomb Festival)

838
00:29:31,474 --> 00:29:36,884
(Squid Fishing Game)

839
00:29:37,754 --> 00:29:43,754
(On the day of the ride around Gyeongpo Lake)

840
00:29:44,054 --> 00:29:45,493
- He's in elementary school.
- Is it by a child?

841
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:46,523
He's in third grade.

842
00:29:46,524 --> 00:29:48,294
- It's cute.
- That's cute.

843
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:51,764
When we visited the old ladies in Chilgok,

844
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,863
- it was sent by Ye Joon.
- It worked.

845
00:29:53,864 --> 00:29:55,333
- Do you remember the car game?
- Yes.

846
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:56,604
(A race game made by Ye Joon)

847
00:29:57,374 --> 00:29:58,873
- Ever since then, - Do they send games?

848
00:29:58,874 --> 00:30:00,873
Children have been sending us games.

849
00:30:00,874 --> 00:30:02,773
- Really?
- Thank you, children.

850
00:30:02,774 --> 00:30:04,514
- I'm so thankful.
- Ye Joon.

851
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,384
(Moved)

852
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:10,784
(Touched)

853
00:30:11,654 --> 00:30:14,384
It looks like this one is from an elderly.

854
00:30:14,554 --> 00:30:16,453
"Hello, members of 2 Days 1 Night."

855
00:30:16,454 --> 00:30:18,324
"I respect and love all of you."

856
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:23,094
"I hope that 2 Days 1 Night continues endlessly."

857
00:30:23,264 --> 00:30:24,934
- "Even at the age of 80,"
- What?

858
00:30:25,294 --> 00:30:26,733
- "I'm grateful..."
- At the age of 80?

859
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:28,933
"that you keep showing such honest, fun,"

860
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:31,604
"and thrilling performances."

861
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:34,604
"You make an old woman laugh."

862
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:36,603
"I wait for it all week long,"

863
00:30:36,604 --> 00:30:37,943
"2 Days 1 Night is amazing."

864
00:30:37,944 --> 00:30:39,174
We should work really hard.

865
00:30:39,474 --> 00:30:41,813
"Lastly, I wish you health."

866
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:43,784
"I will watch it no matter what."

867
00:30:44,414 --> 00:30:46,384
This is very moving.

868
00:30:46,954 --> 00:30:50,123
In today's world...

869
00:30:50,124 --> 00:30:54,264
where the generational gap is huge,

870
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,523
there aren't many shows...

871
00:30:56,524 --> 00:30:57,933
that integrate everyone.

872
00:30:57,934 --> 00:30:59,694
I agree. There are less and less these days.

873
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:01,903
It's probably our show that makes...

874
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:05,703
everyone laugh a few times when an entire family watches it.

875
00:31:05,704 --> 00:31:07,273
You're right. I agree.

876
00:31:07,274 --> 00:31:08,780
- Who else wants to read it?
- Read one of them.

877
00:31:08,804 --> 00:31:10,413
- I'll read this one.
- Please read it out loud.

878
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:11,514
With a good voice.

879
00:31:11,814 --> 00:31:14,784
"Hello, I'm a viewer who loves 2 Days 1 Night."

880
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:19,014
"I never expected myself to become a fan of 2 Days 1 Night."

881
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:22,424
"Two years ago, when I suddenly fell ill,"

882
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,294
"I was engulfed by pain,"

883
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:27,064
"fatigue, and despair."

884
00:31:27,294 --> 00:31:30,024
"You brought me laughter, joy, and energy."

885
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:33,503
"The only thing that made me forget my difficulties for a while..."

886
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:36,464
"was 2 Days 1 Night."

887
00:31:37,374 --> 00:31:39,133
"The joy you gave me once a week..."

888
00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:41,073
"became one of the reasons..."

889
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:42,604
"to endure each day of my life."

890
00:31:42,874 --> 00:31:45,214
- "Thank you very much."
- It gave me goosebumps.

891
00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:46,713
"Who are we?"

892
00:31:46,714 --> 00:31:48,383
- 2 Days 1 Night.
- 2 Days 1 Night.

893
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:50,383
"I will support you until the end. Keep it up."

894
00:31:50,384 --> 00:31:52,284
- Keep it up.
- It gave me goosebumps.

895
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:54,683
I'm so grateful that he wrote us despite being ill.

896
00:31:54,684 --> 00:31:57,624
Reading these makes me feel reassured.

897
00:31:58,554 --> 00:32:00,164
- Are you crying?
- What's the matter?

898
00:32:00,394 --> 00:32:02,894
I think he's very moved.

899
00:32:03,694 --> 00:32:05,993
- He's very sensitive.
- He's emotionally sensitive.

900
00:32:05,994 --> 00:32:07,563
He has a lot of affection for 2 Days 1 Night...

901
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:08,833
- more than other shows.
- Right.

902
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:09,864
Right.

903
00:32:13,374 --> 00:32:20,114
(Overwhelmed with emotions, they stay quiet.)

904
00:32:20,984 --> 00:32:21,984
What is it?

905
00:32:21,985 --> 00:32:24,084
Here's what makes me sad.

906
00:32:25,914 --> 00:32:27,634
Sometimes, it's difficult during the shoot.

907
00:32:28,084 --> 00:32:30,394
It could get stressful or annoying.

908
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,193
When I hear people say that...

909
00:32:32,194 --> 00:32:34,394
they get through their week thanks to our show,

910
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:37,963
I feel both sorry and grateful.

911
00:32:37,964 --> 00:32:39,394
What have we done really?

912
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:43,463
I'm grateful that we can give hope to someone...

913
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:46,874
so that he can get through his week.

914
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,874
It makes me realize that we should work harder.

915
00:32:51,714 --> 00:32:54,644
I thought that I should make more of an effort.

916
00:32:54,944 --> 00:32:56,590
- Even the 80-year-old lady.
- These are...

917
00:32:56,614 --> 00:32:58,883
- from those in their 80s...
- And elementary school students.

918
00:32:58,884 --> 00:33:01,023
Including children who are 5 or 7.

919
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:04,123
Everyone is rooting for us.

920
00:33:04,124 --> 00:33:05,623
Yes, it's huge.

921
00:33:05,624 --> 00:33:06,893
- This is really...
- We should reflect on ourselves.

922
00:33:06,894 --> 00:33:08,623
- a miracle.
- We should...

923
00:33:08,624 --> 00:33:11,094
- Let's go in the water again.
- Again?

924
00:33:11,534 --> 00:33:13,193
- Can you do it again right now?
- What?

925
00:33:13,194 --> 00:33:14,363
Can you do it right away?

926
00:33:14,364 --> 00:33:16,603
I bet he can do it with this much energy.

927
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:17,733
Seriously.

928
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:19,603
My passion will die down on my way there.

929
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:20,643
(Laughing)

930
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:23,044
- Gosh.
- Every time you come to the shoot,

931
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:24,973
keep this close to your heart.

932
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:26,843
- Carry this with you.
- Right.

933
00:33:26,844 --> 00:33:28,444
Carry the letter from the lady with you.

934
00:33:29,244 --> 00:33:31,754
(To our viewers who have always been with us)

935
00:33:32,214 --> 00:33:35,153
For the end of the year 2025,

936
00:33:35,154 --> 00:33:38,853
you wrote us heartwarming letters. Thank you very much.

937
00:33:38,854 --> 00:33:40,093
(Thank you very much.)

938
00:33:40,094 --> 00:33:41,464
To return your love,

939
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:43,594
we will fill you with healthy laughter.

940
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,694
To make you laugh even more...

941
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:47,534
We will continue to work hard.

942
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,664
It gives me a sense of duty.

943
00:33:49,764 --> 00:33:51,603
We will return what you've given us.

944
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:53,234
Show us a lot of your love.

945
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:56,374
With gratitude in our hearts,

946
00:33:56,944 --> 00:33:58,243
let's go and run breathlessly.

947
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,573
- Let's go.
- Why would we be breathless again?

948
00:33:59,574 --> 00:34:00,983
Isn't it over yet?

949
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:03,213
- You're just using our emotions.
- By the way...

950
00:34:03,214 --> 00:34:05,383
You really are people in the TV industry...

951
00:34:05,384 --> 00:34:07,454
- You're mean.
- when I think about it.

952
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:09,153
Let's go and play Dinner Game.

953
00:34:09,154 --> 00:34:10,323
- Let's go.
- Yes.

954
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:11,970
(Let's go and play Dinner Game to make people laugh again.)

955
00:34:11,994 --> 00:34:13,423
(He enters right away.)

956
00:34:13,424 --> 00:34:14,424
(He notices something.)

957
00:34:14,425 --> 00:34:16,793
- Will you keep the food next to us?
- Yes.

958
00:34:16,794 --> 00:34:17,933
It's marinated shrimp.

959
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:19,633
- Soy sauce marinated crab.
- Marinated crab?

960
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:21,334
It's a meal of my favorite food.

961
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:24,174
All the side dishes are perfect with rice.

962
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:27,543
Aren't you eager to work hard right now?

963
00:34:27,544 --> 00:34:29,804
Of course. Our fans are waiting for us.

964
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:32,513
We feel very moved, so we must start immediately.

965
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:36,044
Here's your last dinner of the year 2025.

966
00:34:36,314 --> 00:34:38,014
It's Namhae specialty set meal.

967
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:39,613
My goodness.

968
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:41,824
Generously filled with top quality anchovies,

969
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,384
anchovy ssambap.

970
00:34:43,554 --> 00:34:45,354
Anchovies are a must.

971
00:34:45,454 --> 00:34:47,663
It's from a tasty restaurant in Goseong,

972
00:34:47,664 --> 00:34:49,493
the largest scallop-producing region in the country.

973
00:34:49,494 --> 00:34:50,734
It's marinated red scallops.

974
00:34:51,734 --> 00:34:52,894
Soy sauce marinated crab.

975
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:55,503
We also prepared marinated shrimp.

976
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:56,634
It's a combination of three.

977
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:58,533
A set meal of delicacies.

978
00:34:58,534 --> 00:34:59,673
(A set meal of delicacies from Namhae)

979
00:34:59,674 --> 00:35:00,973
It would be incredible in a wrap.

980
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,373
- Of course.
- The anchovies.

981
00:35:02,374 --> 00:35:04,473
- The food looks amazing.
- A combination of three.

982
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:06,544
- What can we do to eat?
- Goodness.

983
00:35:06,644 --> 00:35:08,913
To wrap up the year that was meaningful and fun,

984
00:35:08,914 --> 00:35:10,513
tonight's Dinner Game is called...

985
00:35:10,514 --> 00:35:12,114
Level Up Together.

986
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:13,983
- "Level Up Together?"
- It's a group game.

987
00:35:13,984 --> 00:35:15,153
- It's a group game.
- Level Up?

988
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,453
It's a group challenge where you can earn the food...

989
00:35:17,454 --> 00:35:19,854
only by completing each mission per level.

990
00:35:20,394 --> 00:35:22,223
When you succeed, you may choose...

991
00:35:22,224 --> 00:35:23,763
whether to attempt the next level.

992
00:35:23,764 --> 00:35:25,204
Everyone moves up to the next level.

993
00:35:25,694 --> 00:35:28,503
If your attempt fails,

994
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:31,203
you must start over from Level One.

995
00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:32,403
(When you fail, you lose the food and return to Level 1.)

996
00:35:32,404 --> 00:35:34,803
You get a total of five chances.

997
00:35:34,804 --> 00:35:36,244
In other words, you have five lives.

998
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,413
Your dinner will depend on the result...

999
00:35:38,414 --> 00:35:39,713
of your last mission.

1000
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:41,783
- So please decide wisely.
- Okay.

1001
00:35:41,784 --> 00:35:43,983
If we fail all of them, will we get nothing?

1002
00:35:43,984 --> 00:35:45,114
Of course.

1003
00:35:45,254 --> 00:35:47,323
That's really harsh.

1004
00:35:47,324 --> 00:35:48,353
Everyone.

1005
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,323
- Level One Mission is...
- Yes?

1006
00:35:50,324 --> 00:35:52,493
United Gonggi.

1007
00:35:52,494 --> 00:35:54,223
- You know how good I am at gonggi?
- Yes.

1008
00:35:54,224 --> 00:35:55,793
- I'm also good at it.
- As you know,

1009
00:35:55,794 --> 00:35:57,463
the fifth and the last level of gonggi is the twist.

1010
00:35:57,464 --> 00:35:58,464
- Yes.
- Yes.

1011
00:35:58,465 --> 00:36:00,063
The six of you will do the twist...

1012
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:02,134
- in a relay.
- In a relay?

1013
00:36:02,364 --> 00:36:05,173
If you catch a total of 24 or more,

1014
00:36:05,174 --> 00:36:06,203
- you will succeed.
- Twenty-four?

1015
00:36:06,204 --> 00:36:08,173
- That's four stones per person.
- Right.

1016
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:09,203
- Okay.
- We can...

1017
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:10,303
- do it.
- Let's start right away.

1018
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:11,943
- This won't make me nervous.
- Try it, Joon.

1019
00:36:11,944 --> 00:36:13,843
I don't need to practice.

1020
00:36:13,844 --> 00:36:15,313
- Just go.
- I'm not nervous.

1021
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:16,583
It's a piece of cake.

1022
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:17,913
- Let's just start.
- Here I go.

1023
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:19,753
- I will start.
- If we fail at this level...

1024
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:21,383
- Well done.
- What is he doing?

1025
00:36:21,384 --> 00:36:22,554
If we fail at this level...

1026
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:24,804
(He was full of confidence, but he dropped two.)

1027
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:25,893
(He feels quite embarrassed.)

1028
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:27,053
This has never happened to me.

1029
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:28,993
(Ice-cold)

1030
00:36:28,994 --> 00:36:31,094
What's wrong with him? I told you to practice.

1031
00:36:31,194 --> 00:36:32,633
You'd better catch them.

1032
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:34,703
- Joon, catch them first.
- I can catch them easily,

1033
00:36:34,704 --> 00:36:35,933
- but...
- What are you doing, Joon?

1034
00:36:35,934 --> 00:36:37,103
This is my first time.

1035
00:36:37,104 --> 00:36:38,704
Why did you open your fingers?

1036
00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:40,033
You should keep them close to each other.

1037
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:42,073
It's my first time doing a bad job on my date of birth...

1038
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,404
What am I saying?

1039
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,113
Your date of birth?

1040
00:36:45,114 --> 00:36:47,943
- I meant in my life.
- Your date of birth?

1041
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:49,513
It's your first time on your date of birth?

1042
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:50,613
What are you talking about?

1043
00:36:50,614 --> 00:36:52,584
I was also shocked because it was my first time.

1044
00:36:52,814 --> 00:36:53,853
- Here I go.
- Okay.

1045
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:55,614
You have to make up for it by catching five.

1046
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:57,124
(Like Joon, he dropped two.)

1047
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,193
It's not bad.

1048
00:36:58,194 --> 00:36:59,293
My goodness.

1049
00:36:59,294 --> 00:37:00,323
(A serious look)

1050
00:37:00,324 --> 00:37:02,464
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

1051
00:37:02,894 --> 00:37:04,894
What are they doing?

1052
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,034
- I got them.
- In that case...

1053
00:37:07,604 --> 00:37:08,963
We have to catch at least...

1054
00:37:08,964 --> 00:37:10,573
- How many are we?
- We have to catch them all.

1055
00:37:10,574 --> 00:37:12,433
Take it seriously.

1056
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:14,643
- What are they doing?
- Be serious. Don't play around.

1057
00:37:14,644 --> 00:37:15,973
It's okay.

1058
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:18,313
- He got it.
- That's right.

1059
00:37:18,314 --> 00:37:19,314
See? We got 11.

1060
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:20,513
He has to catch five.

1061
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:21,944
- Hey.
- Oh, come on.

1062
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:24,153
- Take it easy.
- That's right.

1063
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:25,353
What are you doing?

1064
00:37:25,354 --> 00:37:26,753
- Right now...
- We're doing well so far.

1065
00:37:26,754 --> 00:37:29,154
- Sae Ho.
- We have 16 so far.

1066
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:31,353
- Gosh.
- That's right.

1067
00:37:31,354 --> 00:37:32,793
I just need to catch three.

1068
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:33,964
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Wait.

1069
00:37:34,264 --> 00:37:35,824
Keep your hand perfect for gonggi.

1070
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:38,433
(If he misses at least one, they will fail.)

1071
00:37:38,434 --> 00:37:40,294
(Catch them all!)

1072
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:42,403
That's it.

1073
00:37:42,404 --> 00:37:43,973
(They clear Level 1 Mission.)

1074
00:37:43,974 --> 00:37:45,803
- Nice job.
- See? We made it.

1075
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:47,903
- We gave you guys a chance.
- You should reflect on yourselves.

1076
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,543
We gave you a chance. There was no tension.

1077
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:50,573
- It was to motivate you.
- Forget it.

1078
00:37:50,574 --> 00:37:52,043
(They got steamed rice.)

1079
00:37:52,044 --> 00:37:53,743
- We will definitely keep going.
- Of course.

1080
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:55,213
- Level Two.
- It's definitely yes.

1081
00:37:55,214 --> 00:37:57,353
We will move up. We have to try all of them once.

1082
00:37:57,354 --> 00:37:58,884
Level Two Mission is...

1083
00:37:59,284 --> 00:38:01,283
Kimchi with Your Eyes Covered.

1084
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:03,023
- What's that?
- In this mission,

1085
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:04,553
one of you on behalf of the group will play.

1086
00:38:04,554 --> 00:38:06,553
- It has to be Se Yoon.
- It's like taking a picture?

1087
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:09,063
While wearing the blindfold, guess three types...

1088
00:38:09,064 --> 00:38:11,994
of kimchi correctly by smelling them.

1089
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:14,403
This is difficult.

1090
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:16,280
- How can you guess by smelling?
- It's difficult.

1091
00:38:16,304 --> 00:38:20,173
- Se Yoon's favorite food is kimchi.
- It's kimchi.

1092
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:21,903
- If he fails, - But...

1093
00:38:21,904 --> 00:38:24,574
he has to give back all the money he earned by eating.

1094
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:26,213
- That's right.
- I'm serious.

1095
00:38:26,214 --> 00:38:28,044
That'd be money I earned during two years.

1096
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:29,944
- Se Yoon, would you like to go?
- Wait.

1097
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:31,913
Take out the chili powder in your teeth.

1098
00:38:31,914 --> 00:38:32,983
I can smell it.

1099
00:38:32,984 --> 00:38:34,544
(His pig nose working at full capacity)

1100
00:38:34,684 --> 00:38:35,853
Your molar on the left.

1101
00:38:35,854 --> 00:38:37,053
(That's the spirit.)

1102
00:38:37,054 --> 00:38:38,653
- You can do it.
- Please bring it.

1103
00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:40,693
- You can do it.
- Make your nose sensitive.

1104
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,794
- He'll be able to guess them.
- Se Yoon...

1105
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:44,563
(Sniffing)

1106
00:38:44,564 --> 00:38:45,763
He'll guess them correctly.

1107
00:38:45,764 --> 00:38:47,663
It's impossible for Se Yoon to fail.

1108
00:38:47,664 --> 00:38:49,934
- I'll give it to him 1 by 1.
- Okay.

1109
00:38:50,434 --> 00:38:53,734
(Se Yoon is known to be a lover of kimchi.)

1110
00:38:54,444 --> 00:38:55,743
You eat kimchi without any rice?

1111
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:00,273
(The warrior who likes kimchi more than rice)

1112
00:39:00,274 --> 00:39:02,784
(Actually, he's a kimchi warrior.)

1113
00:39:03,214 --> 00:39:06,283
If he fails to guess them, he should resign from "Tasty Guys."

1114
00:39:06,284 --> 00:39:08,284
This is number one.

1115
00:39:09,284 --> 00:39:10,284
(Sniffing)

1116
00:39:10,285 --> 00:39:11,653
- He definitely recognizes it.
- This is number one.

1117
00:39:11,654 --> 00:39:13,094
(He identifies it in 2 seconds.)

1118
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:14,893
(He's definitely the deity of food.)

1119
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,023
This is number two.

1120
00:39:16,024 --> 00:39:17,184
(Identifying kimchi number 2)

1121
00:39:19,794 --> 00:39:21,504
It's impossible for him to fail.

1122
00:39:21,604 --> 00:39:23,734
Number two is very mature.

1123
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:25,034
(Lastly, identifying kimchi number 3)

1124
00:39:25,035 --> 00:39:27,034
- It's number 3.
- All 3 of them are different.

1125
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:28,974
They smell clearly different.

1126
00:39:29,774 --> 00:39:31,473
- The national team player.
- I'll guess number one.

1127
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:33,644
- Okay.
- It has a strong refreshing smell.

1128
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:35,314
Cucumber kimchi.

1129
00:39:36,144 --> 00:39:39,784
It has a strong spicy smell of green onions.

1130
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:40,854
It's green onion kimchi.

1131
00:39:42,084 --> 00:39:44,124
(So far, he answered two correctly.)

1132
00:39:44,554 --> 00:39:45,794
Here's my guess for number two.

1133
00:39:46,124 --> 00:39:48,123
(What about number 2 that was confusing?)

1134
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:50,194
It's mature exactly the way I like it.

1135
00:39:50,394 --> 00:39:51,833
Actually, this is...

1136
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:52,834
(Sighing)

1137
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:55,464
It becomes mature during the kimchi making season.

1138
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:57,474
It could either be young radish kimchi...

1139
00:39:57,674 --> 00:40:00,233
or regular kimchi. I'll choose between the two.

1140
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:01,503
Today...

1141
00:40:01,504 --> 00:40:02,504
(What will be the kimchi lover's choice?)

1142
00:40:02,505 --> 00:40:04,713
It's more likely to be ripe kimchi.

1143
00:40:04,714 --> 00:40:05,773
(He chooses cabbage kimchi.)

1144
00:40:05,774 --> 00:40:07,914
(Is cabbage kimchi correct?)

1145
00:40:08,014 --> 00:40:09,083
Please.

1146
00:40:09,084 --> 00:40:10,790
(He's nervous because his pride is on the line.)

1147
00:40:10,814 --> 00:40:12,713
- Take off...
- Please.

1148
00:40:12,714 --> 00:40:13,714
- the blindfold.
- Take it off.

1149
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:14,930
(He takes off the blindfold and checks the answer.)

1150
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,354
Please!

1151
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,353
- Okay.
- What was that about?

1152
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:22,693
- Why...
- Why was there a dilemma?

1153
00:40:22,694 --> 00:40:23,763
This is your favorite food.

1154
00:40:23,764 --> 00:40:25,763
I have young radish kimchi at home...

1155
00:40:25,764 --> 00:40:27,463
with the same amount of maturity.

1156
00:40:27,464 --> 00:40:28,464
(A dilemma caused by having too many samples)

1157
00:40:28,465 --> 00:40:30,104
You cleared Level Two Mission.

1158
00:40:30,204 --> 00:40:32,533
You earned a plate of kimchi.

1159
00:40:32,534 --> 00:40:33,803
- Okay.
- Would you like...

1160
00:40:33,804 --> 00:40:35,073
- to try the next level?
- Of course.

1161
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:36,603
- Yes.
- We must play until the end.

1162
00:40:36,604 --> 00:40:38,814
- Let's see.
- Level Three Mission is...

1163
00:40:39,274 --> 00:40:41,843
- Count-up Naming Game.
- "Count-up?"

1164
00:40:41,844 --> 00:40:44,313
You succeed when you say words that match the theme...

1165
00:40:44,314 --> 00:40:46,184
in the order of your sitting.

1166
00:40:46,214 --> 00:40:47,253
(If the theme is movies)

1167
00:40:47,254 --> 00:40:49,153
("The Ring," "Jaws,")

1168
00:40:49,154 --> 00:40:50,824
("New World")

1169
00:40:51,724 --> 00:40:52,853
This is difficult.

1170
00:40:52,854 --> 00:40:54,693
If you succeed Level Three,

1171
00:40:54,694 --> 00:40:57,934
you'll win sweet and salty stir-fried dried anchovies.

1172
00:40:58,334 --> 00:41:00,703
Everyone, let's get started.

1173
00:41:00,704 --> 00:41:04,203
Korean song titles. One, two...

1174
00:41:04,204 --> 00:41:05,404
"Wa."

1175
00:41:05,974 --> 00:41:08,073
One, two...

1176
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:09,074
"Love Song."

1177
00:41:09,874 --> 00:41:12,074
- One, two...
- "APT."

1178
00:41:13,144 --> 00:41:15,313
One, two...

1179
00:41:15,314 --> 00:41:16,344
"I Miss You."

1180
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:19,414
One, two...

1181
00:41:20,614 --> 00:41:21,884
Honestly...

1182
00:41:22,454 --> 00:41:24,193
- What? Wrong.
- Wait a minute.

1183
00:41:24,194 --> 00:41:26,093
When you asked me a four-character song title, I said, "I Miss You."

1184
00:41:26,094 --> 00:41:28,094
You should've told me a five-character song title.

1185
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,533
(While the players in the front are guessing)

1186
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:33,254
(What's a song title with four characters?)

1187
00:41:33,294 --> 00:41:35,063
("I Miss You")

1188
00:41:35,064 --> 00:41:36,064
(Okay, thank you.)

1189
00:41:36,065 --> 00:41:38,004
(What about me?)

1190
00:41:38,334 --> 00:41:39,703
You can't do that to me.

1191
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:40,704
You had so many options.

1192
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:42,643
I asked for your help in return,

1193
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:44,614
but all you cared about was yourself.

1194
00:41:44,974 --> 00:41:46,743
That hurts my feelings.

1195
00:41:46,744 --> 00:41:47,884
Did you give me a look?

1196
00:41:48,044 --> 00:41:49,443
- Of course I did.
- I missed it.

1197
00:41:49,444 --> 00:41:50,613
- I apologize.
- My goodness.

1198
00:41:50,614 --> 00:41:53,154
Your first attempt failed.

1199
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:55,083
We have to start from the beginning.

1200
00:41:55,084 --> 00:41:56,724
Sae Ho is terrible at playing games.

1201
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:58,824
- Everyone.
- We have to start from Level One.

1202
00:41:58,924 --> 00:42:00,763
You have four chances left.

1203
00:42:00,764 --> 00:42:01,764
Let's hurry up.

1204
00:42:01,765 --> 00:42:02,965
- I'll do my best.
- Hurry up.

1205
00:42:02,994 --> 00:42:04,593
- Again...
- Shouldn't we practice?

1206
00:42:04,594 --> 00:42:06,993
- I'll just do it.
- Keep your fingers together.

1207
00:42:06,994 --> 00:42:08,104
- Okay.
- Okay.

1208
00:42:08,134 --> 00:42:09,214
This is how I usually play.

1209
00:42:09,304 --> 00:42:10,304
- Okay.
- Okay.

1210
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:11,533
- Don't make me play.
- This is how I usually play.

1211
00:42:11,534 --> 00:42:12,534
It's over now.

1212
00:42:12,804 --> 00:42:14,004
Don't make me play.

1213
00:42:14,604 --> 00:42:15,844
He got it.

1214
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:18,514
Get the blindfold ready.

1215
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:22,084
Give us the blindfold now. Okay.

1216
00:42:22,344 --> 00:42:23,544
Give us the blindfold.

1217
00:42:26,014 --> 00:42:27,213
- It's over soon.
- Do you want to try?

1218
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:28,224
No.

1219
00:42:28,554 --> 00:42:30,523
(The members got the hang of it.)

1220
00:42:30,524 --> 00:42:32,624
- That's it.
- We can make it.

1221
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,824
- That's it.
- We can make it.

1222
00:42:36,794 --> 00:42:40,494
(He missed one of the stones.)

1223
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:43,034
(DinDin got 0.)

1224
00:42:43,964 --> 00:42:45,634
Wait, I can't do it.

1225
00:42:46,804 --> 00:42:48,174
Why not?

1226
00:42:48,704 --> 00:42:50,673
- There's too much pressure.
- You just need to catch four.

1227
00:42:50,674 --> 00:42:51,844
You just need to catch four.

1228
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,043
This is the worst situation.

1229
00:42:53,044 --> 00:42:54,114
- Wait.
- Goodness.

1230
00:42:54,384 --> 00:42:56,083
I feel so much pressure all of a sudden.

1231
00:42:56,084 --> 00:42:57,853
Jong Min's hand is so sweaty.

1232
00:42:57,854 --> 00:42:59,554
All of a sudden...

1233
00:42:59,654 --> 00:43:00,823
Jong Min, do some practice.

1234
00:43:00,824 --> 00:43:03,084
Why does my wrist hurt so suddenly?

1235
00:43:03,254 --> 00:43:04,393
Calm down.

1236
00:43:04,394 --> 00:43:06,793
- I can't do it.
- One, two. Okay.

1237
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:07,911
My wrist isn't working well.

1238
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:08,975
Jong Min, you can't do it?

1239
00:43:09,091 --> 00:43:10,921
- Jong Min.
- Stay calm.

1240
00:43:12,061 --> 00:43:13,531
(Jong Min gives it a try.)

1241
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:17,331
Why you...

1242
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:20,771
(2 stones are out.)

1243
00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:23,300
Why you...

1244
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,100
(They fail to go up a level.)

1245
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:27,011
- My goodness.
- Why you...

1246
00:43:27,641 --> 00:43:29,440
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm so sorry.

1247
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:30,740
Everyone did so well.

1248
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,740
- I should've caught it like this.
- Listen up.

1249
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:33,750
Today,

1250
00:43:33,751 --> 00:43:35,410
we're one team, so let's not criticize each other.

1251
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:36,581
He deserves to be criticized.

1252
00:43:37,421 --> 00:43:40,221
- Usually, he's...
- How could you...

1253
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:42,190
Why do you keep spreading your fingers?

1254
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:45,521
All right. Your attempt failed.

1255
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:47,860
Okay, let's try it one more time.

1256
00:43:47,861 --> 00:43:49,560
You have three chances left.

1257
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:51,201
(Remaining lives)

1258
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:52,760
- Okay, I'll start.
- I mean...

1259
00:43:52,761 --> 00:43:53,800
I will go now.

1260
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:54,970
If it's three again...

1261
00:43:54,971 --> 00:43:56,171
What is going on here?

1262
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,001
(Dropping)

1263
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:01,440
- What?
- What's the matter with him?

1264
00:44:01,441 --> 00:44:03,811
- Okay.
- It's amazing that he caught them.

1265
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:07,081
Don't be arrogant or conceited.

1266
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:09,880
There you go. You got it.

1267
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:10,921
Goodness.

1268
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,821
- I'm sorry.
- I'll take my time.

1269
00:44:13,121 --> 00:44:14,691
- I'll take my time.
- Nine.

1270
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,421
What's wrong with everyone?

1271
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:20,201
What's the matter with you?

1272
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:22,171
What's the matter with you?

1273
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:24,500
- What?
- Is he crazy?

1274
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:26,431
(Se Yoon got 0.)

1275
00:44:26,561 --> 00:44:27,777
- Goodness.
- What's the matter?

1276
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:29,770
Do all of them have to catch five?

1277
00:44:29,771 --> 00:44:30,970
All of you have to catch five.

1278
00:44:30,971 --> 00:44:32,240
(All 3 of them have to catch 5.)

1279
00:44:32,241 --> 00:44:33,301
What's wrong with you?

1280
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,071
This is impossible.

1281
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:36,541
Nice.

1282
00:44:37,611 --> 00:44:39,811
Sae Ho, you have a chance to make up for your mistakes.

1283
00:44:41,451 --> 00:44:42,451
Okay.

1284
00:44:42,452 --> 00:44:43,680
- Lee Joon.
- Joon.

1285
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,890
Joon, since your date of birth,

1286
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:48,620
you said that you've never missed level five of gonggi.

1287
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:49,891
(A huge pressure at the end)

1288
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:52,391
- What are you...
- I feel so pressured.

1289
00:44:52,761 --> 00:44:54,630
You have to do it under pressure.

1290
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:56,071
You need to feel a little pressured.

1291
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:58,260
Just throw them towards the sky.

1292
00:44:58,261 --> 00:45:00,061
(The warriors' fate depends on Joon's hands.)

1293
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:02,131
- He got it.
- He got it.

1294
00:45:03,371 --> 00:45:04,670
This is...

1295
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:05,870
- What? This is...
- Well done.

1296
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:06,970
Well done.

1297
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:08,510
- I felt so nervous.
- It happens.

1298
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:09,840
- Goodness.
- It happens.

1299
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:11,180
What were you doing?

1300
00:45:11,181 --> 00:45:12,911
We made it in the end.

1301
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,450
- That's true.
- We succeeded.

1302
00:45:14,451 --> 00:45:15,451
Let's move on quickly.

1303
00:45:15,452 --> 00:45:17,150
- We lost a chance during gonggi.
- I'm so hungry.

1304
00:45:17,151 --> 00:45:19,257
- We should eat when we want.
- Kimchi with Your Eyes Covered.

1305
00:45:19,281 --> 00:45:21,521
(Warrior Se Yoon tries it again.)

1306
00:45:21,891 --> 00:45:22,891
(Different types of kimchi arrive.)

1307
00:45:22,892 --> 00:45:24,360
- This is easy.
- It's so difficult.

1308
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:26,060
Se Yoon, this is number one.

1309
00:45:26,061 --> 00:45:27,460
- Number one.
- He'll definitely get it right.

1310
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:30,061
(Identifying the kimchi starts.)

1311
00:45:30,201 --> 00:45:31,201
What's next?

1312
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:32,922
- His guess will be accurate.
- Number two.

1313
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:34,271
Please.

1314
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:35,701
Okay.

1315
00:45:36,531 --> 00:45:38,341
Put it closer to his nose.

1316
00:45:38,441 --> 00:45:39,640
- So that the smell is strong.
- Okay.

1317
00:45:39,641 --> 00:45:40,840
He recognizes it by 100 percent.

1318
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:42,270
- What's number 1?
- I'll start with number 3.

1319
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,481
- Number 3.
- Okay, number 3.

1320
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:46,211
(Se Yoon's choice, kimchi number 1, 2, 3)

1321
00:45:46,212 --> 00:45:47,510
- Number three's green onion kimchi.
- Okay.

1322
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,681
- I'll guess number 2.
- This is number 2.

1323
00:45:50,451 --> 00:45:51,780
- It's cucumber kimchi.
- Okay.

1324
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:54,290
I think number one changed. Number one is...

1325
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:55,620
(Number 2: Cucumber kimchi, Number 3: Green onion kimchi)

1326
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:56,720
It's mustard greens kimchi.

1327
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:58,960
(Number 1: Mustard greens kimchi)

1328
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:01,131
- One, two, three.
- Okay.

1329
00:46:02,031 --> 00:46:03,290
- We got it.
- Let's go.

1330
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:05,861
(Correct!)

1331
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:08,370
(Everyone passed Level 2 and won kimchi.)

1332
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:10,070
- He's the king of kimchi.
- You made up for your mistake.

1333
00:46:10,071 --> 00:46:11,201
That's right. We got it.

1334
00:46:12,371 --> 00:46:14,411
Everyone, please look to the front.

1335
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:16,741
Let's pass this level.

1336
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:18,681
Here we go.

1337
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:21,811
Female singers, including groups and disbanded groups.

1338
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:25,050
- Does that include everyone?
- One, two...

1339
00:46:25,051 --> 00:46:26,150
Byul.

1340
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:28,250
- One, two...
- Yangpa.

1341
00:46:28,251 --> 00:46:29,750
- One...
- Noh Sa Yeon.

1342
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:32,560
- One, two, three.
- Red Velvet.

1343
00:46:32,561 --> 00:46:35,431
- One, two...
- Baby V.O.X.

1344
00:46:35,631 --> 00:46:36,631
- One, - We got this.

1345
00:46:36,632 --> 00:46:38,860
- Two.
- SAY MY NAME.

1346
00:46:38,861 --> 00:46:40,431
- Okay.
- That's correct.

1347
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,470
They work with Kim Jae Joong's agency.

1348
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:43,770
- SAY MY NAME.
- The one run by Kim Jae Joong.

1349
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:46,070
- How did you know?
- Is Joon the ace?

1350
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:47,840
- I'm the ace, you know.
- How did you know?

1351
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:50,110
- All right. Everyone.
- That was unexpected.

1352
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,941
- I said the correct answer.
- I'm impressed.

1353
00:46:52,481 --> 00:46:55,511
(Level 4, anchovy ssambap)

1354
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:02,790
(Anchovy ssambap is unlocked.)

1355
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:04,920
- Will you try the next level?
- We should eat ssambap.

1356
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:05,921
- Let's eat ssambap.
- Right. We should go for it.

1357
00:47:05,922 --> 00:47:07,790
Does anyone want to stop here? None does, right?

1358
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,090
- We should go for it.
- Let's go for it.

1359
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:11,011
- We'll do it.
- We still have a few lives left.

1360
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:15,501
The game on Level Four you'll play to gain anchovy ssambap...

1361
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:17,477
which is one of the delicacies of Namhae is...

1362
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:21,211
Hit the Drum, Head, and Belly in the Room.

1363
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:22,871
Oh, no. I'm not good at this game.

1364
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,440
(The name of the game alone makes every member worry.)

1365
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:27,211
"Hit the drum, head, and belly." That game?

1366
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:29,741
(The last time they played the game...)

1367
00:47:29,851 --> 00:47:31,481
(Except for Se Yoon and Sae Ho, )

1368
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:33,480
(all members...)

1369
00:47:33,481 --> 00:47:35,121
(failed.)

1370
00:47:35,191 --> 00:47:36,920
- I'm...
- Please set it up.

1371
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:38,561
- I'm the worst at it.
- Gosh, seriously.

1372
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:40,930
We prepared the indoor version of the game.

1373
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:42,790
This time, you shake your shoulders while playing the game.

1374
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:45,300
Left, left

1375
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:47,701
- Left, left - Left, left

1376
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:49,131
When I say, "Hit the drum,"

1377
00:47:49,831 --> 00:47:52,270
you have to hit the pot with the spoon.

1378
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:54,140
- Hit the drum.
- The drum.

1379
00:47:54,141 --> 00:47:55,581
- When I say, "Hit the head,"
- Yes?

1380
00:47:55,771 --> 00:47:57,940
Lift up the pot and hit your head with it.

1381
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:58,941
Oh, like this?

1382
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:00,857
- What about the belly?
- When I say, "Hit the belly,"

1383
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:03,210
hit your belly with the spoon.

1384
00:48:03,211 --> 00:48:04,650
- Like this?
- Okay. Got it.

1385
00:48:04,651 --> 00:48:06,480
All members play together,

1386
00:48:06,481 --> 00:48:08,790
and you have to succeed five times to move up.

1387
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:11,391
- Can you make it 3 times?
- You'll have 3 attempts.

1388
00:48:12,621 --> 00:48:14,830
Three attempts? Let's practice five times.

1389
00:48:14,831 --> 00:48:16,390
- Okay.
- Ready, go.

1390
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:18,730
- Left, left - Left, left

1391
00:48:18,731 --> 00:48:20,601
(Left, left)

1392
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:23,100
Hit the head. Hit the drum. Hit the drum. Hit the head.

1393
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:25,447
- Hit the head, drum, drum, head.
- Hit the head, drum, head, head.

1394
00:48:25,471 --> 00:48:28,740
Left, left

1395
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:30,840
Hit the head. Hit the drum. Hit the drum. Hit the head.

1396
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,117
- Hit the head, drum, drum, head.
- Hit the head, drum, drum, head.

1397
00:48:33,141 --> 00:48:34,150
All right.

1398
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:35,281
What do you think?

1399
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:37,581
- Seon Ho...
- You're just an idiot.

1400
00:48:38,151 --> 00:48:40,391
You should've practiced the game...

1401
00:48:40,821 --> 00:48:42,290
- at home.
- Can you do this? One, two, three,

1402
00:48:42,291 --> 00:48:43,760
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1403
00:48:43,761 --> 00:48:44,761
Try it.

1404
00:48:44,991 --> 00:48:46,390
One, two, three, four, five,

1405
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:47,951
- six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
- Gosh.

1406
00:48:48,031 --> 00:48:49,690
He has such poor hand-eye coordination.

1407
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:51,360
Have you ever fallen off a high place before?

1408
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,037
(Yoo Seon Ho is the biggest variable on Level 4.)

1409
00:48:53,061 --> 00:48:55,001
- I have an idea, Director Joo.
- What is it?

1410
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:58,301
We take turns, and all six of us have to pass.

1411
00:48:58,641 --> 00:49:00,570
- That's not a bad idea.
- That doesn't sound bad.

1412
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:01,641
More than you think...

1413
00:49:02,011 --> 00:49:05,010
Then let's make it simple. You'll have only one attempt.

1414
00:49:05,011 --> 00:49:06,657
- Right.
- You have to do it in your turn.

1415
00:49:06,681 --> 00:49:08,757
- You can pass if you do it once.
- Let's give it a try.

1416
00:49:08,781 --> 00:49:10,450
- Seon Ho, you...
- You go first.

1417
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:11,920
- If he fails, and if you feel bad, - Jong Min.

1418
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:12,951
Switch seats with him.

1419
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:16,120
One, two, three, four.

1420
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:17,390
Left

1421
00:49:17,391 --> 00:49:19,660
(Left, left)

1422
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:21,131
- Left - Don't do that.

1423
00:49:21,331 --> 00:49:24,101
- Stop doing that, will you?
- Why would you do that?

1424
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:26,101
But I find it so fun.

1425
00:49:26,901 --> 00:49:29,270
This is the most fun part of the game.

1426
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:30,600
- In that case...
- You can do it later.

1427
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:31,740
But...

1428
00:49:31,741 --> 00:49:33,871
Left, left

1429
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:36,310
Hit the drum. Hit the head. Hit the belly.

1430
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:37,380
It's so much fun.

1431
00:49:37,381 --> 00:49:38,440
(No singing "left")

1432
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:41,080
- What's so difficult about this?
- One, two, three, four.

1433
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:43,410
Hit the head. Hit the drum. Hit the head. Hit the drum.

1434
00:49:43,411 --> 00:49:45,550
- Head, drum, head, drum.
- Good.

1435
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:47,821
(The biggest variable Seon Ho passed!)

1436
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:49,590
- Left - Left

1437
00:49:49,591 --> 00:49:50,591
- Left - Don't.

1438
00:49:50,661 --> 00:49:53,320
Hit the belly. Hit the belly. Hit the drum. Hit the head.

1439
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:55,390
Hit the belly. Hit the belly. Hit the drum. Hit the head.

1440
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:57,760
- Left, left - Left

1441
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,100
Hit the drum. Hit the belly. Hit the drum. Hit the head.

1442
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:02,200
Hit the drum. Hit the belly. Hit the drum. Hit the head.

1443
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:04,570
- Left, left - Left, left

1444
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:06,770
Hit the head. Hit the drum. Hit the belly. Hit the head.

1445
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:07,931
- Hit the head.
- You failed.

1446
00:50:08,941 --> 00:50:10,040
Seriously!

1447
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,180
Why did you sing it?

1448
00:50:12,181 --> 00:50:13,380
Seriously!

1449
00:50:13,381 --> 00:50:15,981
(They failed to move up to the next level.)

1450
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:20,321
Are you here to have fun?

1451
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:24,321
That's why I said I wanted to sing it from the start.

1452
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:26,767
I sang it late, so I didn't have enough time to warm up.

1453
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:27,990
- I mean...
- Why...

1454
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,900
- Why do you have to sing it?
- Holding it back distracted me.

1455
00:50:30,901 --> 00:50:32,000
Holding back from singing?

1456
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:34,271
- Why must he...
- You should've let me sing.

1457
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:36,831
It's my routine.

1458
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,041
I've never failed in this game before.

1459
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:41,011
I know what you mean, but...

1460
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:44,041
- Se Yoon, listen. It's not right.
- Your third attempt failed.

1461
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:45,711
You have two attempts left.

1462
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:48,380
Hold on. We all have to focus.

1463
00:50:48,381 --> 00:50:50,251
- Or it'll be our last chance.
- Exactly.

1464
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:52,850
(They passed Level 1.)

1465
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:55,050
(They passed Level 2.)

1466
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:57,561
(They passed Level 3.)

1467
00:50:58,721 --> 00:51:02,291
(They moved up to Level 4 together!)

1468
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:05,061
- Okay. Let's begin.
- I'm really bad at this game.

1469
00:51:05,731 --> 00:51:06,931
- Here we go.
- Okay.

1470
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,000
One, two, three, four.

1471
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:12,470
Left, left

1472
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:14,740
- Left, left - Left, left

1473
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:17,010
Hit the drum. Hit the drum. Hit the head. Hit the head.

1474
00:51:17,011 --> 00:51:19,010
Hit the drum. Hit the drum. Hit the head. Hit the head.

1475
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:20,410
- Left - Left

1476
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,610
(He passed.)

1477
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:22,850
Left

1478
00:51:22,851 --> 00:51:25,150
Hit the head. Hit the drum. Hit the drum. Hit the head.

1479
00:51:25,151 --> 00:51:27,320
Hit the head. Hit the drum. Hit the drum. Hit the head.

1480
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:29,650
- Left, left - Left, left

1481
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:31,860
Hit the head. Hit the drum. Hit the belly. Hit the drum.

1482
00:51:31,861 --> 00:51:34,531
Hit the head. Hit the drum. Hit the belly. Hit the drum.

1483
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:37,030
Left, left

1484
00:51:37,031 --> 00:51:39,430
Hit the belly. Hit the drum. Hit the belly. Hit the head.

1485
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:41,530
Hit the belly. Hit the drum. Hit the belly. Hit the head.

1486
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,301
- Left, left - Hang on.

1487
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:46,771
Wait. What's wrong? What's the matter?

1488
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:48,240
- I hit myself too hard.
- You startled me.

1489
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:49,340
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

1490
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:50,710
- Let's start now.
- Okay.

1491
00:51:50,711 --> 00:51:51,880
- One, two, - Wait. Drum...

1492
00:51:51,881 --> 00:51:53,810
- Drum, head, and belly. Okay.
- three...

1493
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:54,910
(The momentum is paused.)

1494
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,910
One, two, three, four.

1495
00:51:56,911 --> 00:51:59,280
Left, left

1496
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:01,750
Hit the head. Hit the belly. Hit the drum. Hit the head.

1497
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,050
(Hit the head. Hit the belly.)

1498
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:04,160
(Hit the drum. Hit the head.)

1499
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:06,621
- That's good.
- Left, left

1500
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:09,190
Hit the drum. Hit the belly. Hit the drum. Hit the head.

1501
00:52:09,191 --> 00:52:10,800
(Hit the drum. Hit the belly. Hit the drum. Hit the head.)

1502
00:52:10,801 --> 00:52:11,801
- We passed.
- Yes!

1503
00:52:13,201 --> 00:52:14,470
- You did a great job.
- I was so scared.

1504
00:52:14,471 --> 00:52:16,830
- Left, left - I couldn't hear the last one.

1505
00:52:16,831 --> 00:52:18,140
Left

1506
00:52:18,141 --> 00:52:20,101
- All right.
- This is really hard.

1507
00:52:20,741 --> 00:52:23,011
- Let's stop here.
- I have a headache.

1508
00:52:23,711 --> 00:52:28,480
You have gained anchovy ssambap.

1509
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:30,411
We can have a hearty meal. That's enough for us.

1510
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:34,051
(Even if they stop here, they'll have quite a hearty meal.)

1511
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:38,221
(Right then, a new quest appears in front of the players!)

1512
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:42,031
(Marinated crab, scallop, and shrimp are unlocked.)

1513
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:44,200
You will try Level Five, right?

1514
00:52:44,201 --> 00:52:45,300
(Will you continue playing the game to gain marinated trio?)

1515
00:52:45,301 --> 00:52:46,961
- Let's go for it!
- Let's do it!

1516
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,607
- We still have one chance left.
- It's year-end. Let's go for it.

1517
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:52,101
If we fail this time, let's stop at Level Four next time.

1518
00:52:52,941 --> 00:52:56,041
The long-awaited game on Level Five is...

1519
00:52:58,411 --> 00:53:00,110
Table Tennis on a Dining Table.

1520
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:01,651
- Please set it up.
- What game is it?

1521
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:04,581
I guess we have to hit the target.

1522
00:53:05,221 --> 00:53:06,720
That yogurt drink bottle must be the target.

1523
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:08,420
Oh, we have to hit the bottle?

1524
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:09,767
(Finally, the final boss shows itself.)

1525
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:12,790
Hit a table tennis ball with a plate...

1526
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:15,330
and with it, hit the ball at the end of the table...

1527
00:53:15,331 --> 00:53:16,431
to complete the mission.

1528
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,600
- How many attempts do we have?
- It won't be easy.

1529
00:53:18,601 --> 00:53:21,070
Each of you will take turns, and you have only one attempt.

1530
00:53:21,071 --> 00:53:22,071
Just once?

1531
00:53:22,601 --> 00:53:24,877
Even if only one of you succeeds, you'll complete the mission.

1532
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,271
I'm sure one of us will succeed.

1533
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:28,141
Even if only one of you succeed,

1534
00:53:28,511 --> 00:53:32,240
we'll give you marinated crab, scallop, and shrimp.

1535
00:53:32,241 --> 00:53:33,281
You'll have them all.

1536
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,251
We need to practice once.

1537
00:53:35,511 --> 00:53:37,320
- Okay.
- Hurry up and try it.

1538
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:38,401
- Shall I do it now?
- Yes.

1539
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:39,921
Okay.

1540
00:53:40,281 --> 00:53:41,450
We have a few attempts, right?

1541
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:42,891
Jong Min is good at games like this.

1542
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:44,061
Oh, he's not good at it.

1543
00:53:44,261 --> 00:53:45,461
That's it?

1544
00:53:45,591 --> 00:53:46,760
- That's it.
- Really?

1545
00:53:46,761 --> 00:53:48,037
(They're allowed to practice only once!)

1546
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:49,690
(Next up is DinDin.)

1547
00:53:49,691 --> 00:53:51,011
We'll have a few attempts, right?

1548
00:53:51,531 --> 00:53:53,107
- You can't practice more than once.
- You have to hit it this way.

1549
00:53:53,131 --> 00:53:55,171
You should hit it roughly. You can't calculate it.

1550
00:53:55,971 --> 00:53:57,231
(Joon tries it.)

1551
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:58,770
(He failed.)

1552
00:53:58,771 --> 00:53:59,901
I'll go next.

1553
00:54:00,201 --> 00:54:01,371
(Sae Ho tries it.)

1554
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:03,940
I don't think we'll succeed. We won't succeed.

1555
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:05,110
- It's a little bit...
- You should move slowly...

1556
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:06,541
(Worried)

1557
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:08,151
I don't think we'll succeed.

1558
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:11,350
The one who passes this game will be our hero.

1559
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:13,027
- He'll be a superstar.
- Let's give it a try.

1560
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:14,051
It'll be a good way to end this year.

1561
00:54:14,052 --> 00:54:15,692
- Next year will be a good year.
- Right.

1562
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:17,471
This will determine our luck in next year.

1563
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:20,360
- I'll start.
- The staff are rooting for us too.

1564
00:54:20,361 --> 00:54:21,890
- That's right.
- Give us a round of applause.

1565
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,191
That's right.

1566
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,500
That's good. Let's make this a fantastic end of the year.

1567
00:54:26,501 --> 00:54:27,730
- Let's do this.
- Let's get some good energy.

1568
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,000
(They will succeed if they hit the final boss.)

1569
00:54:29,001 --> 00:54:31,671
- DinDin, succeed in one go.
- So that we won't have to do it.

1570
00:54:31,941 --> 00:54:33,841
(DinDin will try.)

1571
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:38,880
- It was too...
- It's okay.

1572
00:54:38,881 --> 00:54:40,810
You can't pull this off even if you practice.

1573
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:42,181
We have one life left. It's okay.

1574
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:43,511
Sae Ho, let's go!

1575
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:45,581
He'll make it.

1576
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:46,951
- That was close.
- You can't...

1577
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:49,090
You can't calculate the angle or anything to hit the target.

1578
00:54:49,091 --> 00:54:50,331
- It's hard.
- The ball curves.

1579
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:52,331
Just look at the target and hit the ball.

1580
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:54,390
An I hit the target without making the ball bounce?

1581
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,890
- Yes, you can.
- Of course. Why not?

1582
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:57,161
You're good at baseball.

1583
00:54:58,031 --> 00:54:59,300
Think that you swing a baseball bat.

1584
00:54:59,301 --> 00:55:00,360
Seon Ho, finish the game.

1585
00:55:00,361 --> 00:55:02,481
(As if you swing a baseball bat, hit the final boss.)

1586
00:55:04,671 --> 00:55:06,340
- Can I try it?
- Yes, go ahead.

1587
00:55:06,341 --> 00:55:07,640
- Do it in your own way.
- Joon, can I try it?

1588
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:08,940
- Do it as you want.
- Try whatever you want.

1589
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:10,041
We're behind you.

1590
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:11,711
We're behind you.

1591
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:14,081
We're behind you.

1592
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,311
- Hey.
- That was just weird.

1593
00:55:16,451 --> 00:55:18,421
- Hey.
- That was just weird.

1594
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,820
(He was confident, but the result is not good at all.)

1595
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:22,221
- What was that?
- What did you do?

1596
00:55:22,351 --> 00:55:23,650
- It's okay.
- I shouldn't try this again.

1597
00:55:23,651 --> 00:55:24,760
What was that?

1598
00:55:24,761 --> 00:55:25,820
How many of you are left?

1599
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:28,961
Se Yoon, Jong Min, and Joon are left.

1600
00:55:29,091 --> 00:55:30,091
- You see...
- That's right.

1601
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:33,961
(Se Yoon, who did the best when practicing, will try it.)

1602
00:55:34,071 --> 00:55:35,200
- You see...
- You'll hit it diagonally?

1603
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:37,440
- You can't hit it straight.
- But earlier...

1604
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:38,900
- It's supposed to go like this.
- That's right.

1605
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:39,941
This is only right.

1606
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,040
Se Yoon, you're right. It's a good strategy.

1607
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:44,410
This is only right. The angle doesn't make sense.

1608
00:55:44,411 --> 00:55:45,717
- They do this in table tennis.
- Absolutely.

1609
00:55:45,741 --> 00:55:47,310
Let's sing the song to cheer for Se Yoon.

1610
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:51,751
(Left, left)

1611
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:53,250
- The ball will go...
- Left

1612
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:56,250
(Left, left)

1613
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:58,020
- Left, left - Left

1614
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,691
(Se Yoon will try it.)

1615
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:03,161
(He's practically the only hope they have.)

1616
00:56:05,861 --> 00:56:07,671
Let's go. You'll be a superstar.

1617
00:56:08,571 --> 00:56:09,851
Let's go. You'll be a superstar.

1618
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:11,601
That was close.

1619
00:56:12,571 --> 00:56:13,840
- That's the right angle.
- That was close.

1620
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:15,410
- Yes, that's right.
- You should hit diagonally.

1621
00:56:15,411 --> 00:56:16,470
- That's the right angle.
- Yes, that's right.

1622
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:18,080
(The probability of passing Level 5 is close to 0 now.)

1623
00:56:18,081 --> 00:56:19,211
Joon, you go next.

1624
00:56:19,481 --> 00:56:21,080
(The remaining players are only two, Joon and Jong Min.)

1625
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:22,150
Jong Min should go last.

1626
00:56:22,151 --> 00:56:24,097
Jong Min is lucky when it comes to games like this.

1627
00:56:24,121 --> 00:56:26,851
(Nervous)

1628
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:29,820
- Please.
- Joon has been so lucky lately.

1629
00:56:29,821 --> 00:56:30,821
(Joon will try it.)

1630
00:56:30,822 --> 00:56:31,990
- I'll start.
- All right.

1631
00:56:31,991 --> 00:56:33,160
(If they fail to kill the final boss, )

1632
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:35,561
(they'll go back to Level 1.)

1633
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:37,131
You have to get it, Joon!

1634
00:56:39,231 --> 00:56:40,301
You have to get it, Joon!

1635
00:56:41,371 --> 00:56:42,431
I'll focus.

1636
00:56:53,211 --> 00:56:55,581
(Warrior Joon did it.)

1637
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:01,951
(Neatly cleared the mission)

1638
00:57:13,231 --> 00:57:15,230
- What was that? It's amazing.
- Left

1639
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:17,770
- Left, left - Left, left

1640
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:19,571
- What was that?
- You!

1641
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:23,010
- You did it.
- My goodness.

1642
00:57:23,011 --> 00:57:24,587
(An unbelievable victory against all odds)

1643
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:27,211
- Goodness, Joon.
- That was crazy.

1644
00:57:27,981 --> 00:57:30,080
- What was that, Joon?
- Goodness.

1645
00:57:30,081 --> 00:57:31,580
- What? Goodness.
- Thank you, Joon.

1646
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:32,727
- What was that?
- Thank you.

1647
00:57:32,751 --> 00:57:34,080
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

1648
00:57:34,081 --> 00:57:35,350
- I don't know.
- Hey...

1649
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,620
(Impressed)

1650
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:38,760
- That was crazy, goodness.
- How did you even do that?

1651
00:57:38,761 --> 00:57:39,761
I have no idea.

1652
00:57:40,461 --> 00:57:41,931
Super star, Joon.

1653
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:45,531
Joon made it, congratulations.

1654
00:57:45,961 --> 00:57:47,100
I can't believe I did it.

1655
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:48,870
That was incredible.

1656
00:57:48,871 --> 00:57:52,101
(Marinated trio)

1657
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,340
- This is more than enough.
- Let's just enjoy what we have.

1658
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:58,941
- Sure.
- Let's eat.

1659
00:57:59,411 --> 00:58:01,010
Okay, let's enjoy our meal.

1660
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,511
- Let's eat.
- That was amazing.

1661
00:58:02,951 --> 00:58:04,520
- We'll prepare your meal.
- Okay.

1662
00:58:04,521 --> 00:58:05,821
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1663
00:58:06,021 --> 00:58:07,081
Great.

1664
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,491
(Meal preparation in progress)

1665
00:58:10,551 --> 00:58:11,990
Your meal is ready.

1666
00:58:11,991 --> 00:58:12,991
(Meal is ready to serve.)

1667
00:58:12,992 --> 00:58:14,491
- This is great.
- You're the ace.

1668
00:58:15,231 --> 00:58:16,660
Thanks to Joon...

1669
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:17,941
(A long-overdue dinner together)

1670
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,731
(Underneath the blue sea of Namhae)

1671
00:58:20,231 --> 00:58:23,671
(Full of fresh seafood)

1672
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:26,240
(Brought treasures of the sea to your table)

1673
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:27,940
He has done it because he reassured himself.

1674
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:29,310
- I know.
- Right.

1675
00:58:29,311 --> 00:58:30,311
We were so desperate.

1676
00:58:30,312 --> 00:58:32,410
- These crabs are amazing.
- Joon is treating this.

1677
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:33,411
(The perfect balance of sweet and salty, marinated crabs)

1678
00:58:33,412 --> 00:58:35,280
- Goodness, look at this.
- Thank you for this.

1679
00:58:35,281 --> 00:58:36,951
This is crazy, gosh.

1680
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,721
Joon is treating this.

1681
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:42,021
There is a lot of crab roe.

1682
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:45,090
- Isn't this huge?
- Yes.

1683
00:58:45,091 --> 00:58:49,331
(The rich, mouth-filling flavor of soy-marinated crab)

1684
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:50,791
This marinated crab tastes amazing!

1685
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:53,291
- Goodness, this is so delicious.
- So good.

1686
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,777
This is not salty at all. It tastes so good.

1687
00:58:56,801 --> 00:58:58,301
Right, it's not salty at all.

1688
00:58:59,641 --> 00:59:01,270
Look how DinDin mixes rice in the shell.

1689
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,810
(Mixing rice into the crab shell is a must.)

1690
00:59:02,811 --> 00:59:04,841
Goodness, look.

1691
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:08,551
(This is it.)

1692
00:59:08,881 --> 00:59:09,881
Is the scallop good?

1693
00:59:09,882 --> 00:59:11,257
- I haven't tried it yet.
- You haven't?

1694
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,181
(Chewy, sweet-and-salty soy-marinated scallops)

1695
00:59:13,351 --> 00:59:14,991
Why is this scallop so small?

1696
00:59:15,021 --> 00:59:17,141
Red scallops are usually small and have a nice smell.

1697
00:59:17,761 --> 00:59:18,791
How did you know that?

1698
00:59:18,991 --> 00:59:20,890
Red scallops are delicious.

1699
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:24,531
(Is what Seon Ho said true?)

1700
00:59:25,231 --> 00:59:27,100
- Scallops taste amazing.
- Red scallops are delicious.

1701
00:59:27,101 --> 00:59:28,870
- It smells so good.
- This is perfect.

1702
00:59:28,871 --> 00:59:29,871
(Feeling proud)

1703
00:59:30,301 --> 00:59:31,941
Soy-marinated shrimp.

1704
00:59:36,371 --> 00:59:38,081
(Touched)

1705
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:39,721
This marinated trio is splendid.

1706
00:59:40,111 --> 00:59:41,180
It tastes so good.

1707
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:42,427
(Namhae marinated seafood trio that goes well with steamed rice)

1708
00:59:42,451 --> 00:59:43,951
How do we eat anchovy ssambap?

1709
00:59:44,451 --> 00:59:47,181
I lost my voice because I shouted so much when I cheered for Joon.

1710
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:49,891
(DinDin must have been so happy.)

1711
00:59:49,991 --> 00:59:51,721
How do we eat anchovy ssambap?

1712
00:59:52,621 --> 00:59:53,790
(This is how you eat anchovy ssambap.)

1713
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,607
(For those who haven't seen anchovy ssambap before: DinDin)

1714
00:59:55,631 --> 00:59:59,130
Put this on top of the vegetable.

1715
00:59:59,131 --> 01:00:00,330
(Putting a plump piece of anchovy on top of the vegetable wrap)

1716
01:00:00,331 --> 01:00:02,531
Then add a clove of garlic on top.

1717
01:00:03,101 --> 01:00:04,130
This is anchovy ssambap.

1718
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:05,851
(Local delicacy of Namhae, anchovy ssambap)

1719
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:08,571
(Taking a big bite)

1720
01:00:08,741 --> 01:00:10,140
It smells so good and tastes amazing.

1721
01:00:10,141 --> 01:00:11,501
(Savoring it along with its aroma)

1722
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:14,041
(Enjoying anchovy ssambap)

1723
01:00:14,981 --> 01:00:16,911
- Isn't it delicious?
- It's excellent.

1724
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:20,380
This anchovy tastes like mackerel pike.

1725
01:00:20,381 --> 01:00:21,450
(Plump, saury-like fresh anchovies)

1726
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,450
- The texture is...
- And the taste is...

1727
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:24,660
The texture is amazing.

1728
01:00:24,661 --> 01:00:26,021
Goodness, anchovy ssambap.

1729
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:28,030
Having anchovy ssambap in Namhae...

1730
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,791
(Rich and savory with no fishy smell at all)

1731
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:32,800
(It's perfect even for DinDin the Kid's palate.)

1732
01:00:32,801 --> 01:00:33,961
It tastes like a mackerel.

1733
01:00:35,931 --> 01:00:38,171
(This is the true flavor of Namhae.)

1734
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:39,500
Thank you, Joon.

1735
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:40,670
(Thanking Joon for so many times)

1736
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:42,970
Joon has become the ace of the team.

1737
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:45,110
He beat all the games since this morning.

1738
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:46,681
- Right.
- He won all the games.

1739
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:49,751
(When he had to carry the bags)

1740
01:00:50,581 --> 01:00:54,920
(When he worked on dinosaur quizzes)

1741
01:00:54,921 --> 01:00:55,921
That is correct.

1742
01:00:55,922 --> 01:00:58,691
(Joon's performance shined every single time.)

1743
01:00:58,991 --> 01:01:01,031
How do you know so much about dinosaurs, Joon?

1744
01:01:01,361 --> 01:01:03,261
Joon knows everything.

1745
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:04,600
Right.

1746
01:01:04,601 --> 01:01:06,631
(Tremendous praise)

1747
01:01:06,901 --> 01:01:09,300
I never thought I'd hear this in my life.

1748
01:01:09,301 --> 01:01:10,870
Joon knows everything.

1749
01:01:10,871 --> 01:01:11,941
I know, my bad.

1750
01:01:12,141 --> 01:01:13,200
That was really great.

1751
01:01:13,201 --> 01:01:15,087
(They got to taste the delicacies of Namhae thanks to Joon.)

1752
01:01:15,111 --> 01:01:17,392
I want to sleep right here after putting the table aside.

1753
01:01:17,471 --> 01:01:19,911
I can just push it over there and sleep here.

1754
01:01:20,611 --> 01:01:21,880
That sounded very primal.

1755
01:01:21,881 --> 01:01:26,221
(After having dinner)

1756
01:01:26,681 --> 01:01:30,291
(Night has quietly fallen over the base camp.)

1757
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:41,701
(Surveillance cameras beginning to turn on one by one)

1758
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:45,371
(They are taking a break in their room.)

1759
01:01:45,441 --> 01:01:46,971
It's very cold outside.

1760
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:50,571
Right. It's cold. It's so warm inside. I love it.

1761
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:54,341
(Looking calm and carefree with no idea what lies ahead)

1762
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:57,051
(The production crew somehow looks very busy.)

1763
01:01:57,151 --> 01:01:59,580
So when they do that, we will shoot right away.

1764
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:01,251
(What are they planning?)

1765
01:02:07,061 --> 01:02:08,460
Anyone wants to use the bathroom?

1766
01:02:08,461 --> 01:02:10,391
- No, we are good.
- All right.

1767
01:02:10,531 --> 01:02:12,460
- What's going on?
- You're wearing eye masks now.

1768
01:02:12,461 --> 01:02:13,960
- Why?
- What's going on?

1769
01:02:13,961 --> 01:02:15,130
- No.
- Eye masks? No.

1770
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:16,830
That doesn't sound right.

1771
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,571
- It's scary.
- That scares me.

1772
01:02:19,701 --> 01:02:21,547
- Do we wear them now?
- Yes, you can wear them now.

1773
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,470
- No.
- No.

1774
01:02:23,471 --> 01:02:24,610
I can't see anything.

1775
01:02:24,611 --> 01:02:26,910
(Feeling anxious)

1776
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:28,111
We'll get going now.

1777
01:02:29,681 --> 01:02:31,051
Left.

1778
01:02:31,151 --> 01:02:34,690
(Left foot, left foot)

1779
01:02:34,691 --> 01:02:35,950
- Be careful.
- Left foot.

1780
01:02:35,951 --> 01:02:37,591
- I don't see the threshold.
- Left foot.

1781
01:02:38,061 --> 01:02:40,160
- I don't see the threshold.
- Left foot.

1782
01:02:40,161 --> 01:02:41,161
I can't see anything.

1783
01:02:41,162 --> 01:02:42,661
That's what eye masks do.

1784
01:02:42,891 --> 01:02:44,160
I can't see the floor.

1785
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:45,881
- Hold on.
- That's why we're wearing them.

1786
01:02:46,431 --> 01:02:47,900
- What? You're opening the door?
- Yes.

1787
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:49,000
Do we get in?

1788
01:02:49,001 --> 01:02:50,230
- Yes.
- We're in a room.

1789
01:02:50,231 --> 01:02:51,540
- Let me know when there's a step.
- We're in a room.

1790
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:52,541
There is a step right in front of you.

1791
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:53,541
Where?

1792
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:55,182
- We're in a room.
- Gosh, this is scary.

1793
01:02:55,411 --> 01:02:58,410
All right, you turn right now.

1794
01:02:58,411 --> 01:02:59,411
- Yes.
- To the right.

1795
01:02:59,411 --> 01:03:00,411
Turn right.

1796
01:03:00,412 --> 01:03:02,250
- Please sit cross-legged.
- We are sitting here?

1797
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:03,310
Yes.

1798
01:03:03,311 --> 01:03:04,350
(To be continued shortly)

1799
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:05,751
Goodness.

1800
01:03:05,821 --> 01:03:06,821
Gosh, it's cold.

1801
01:03:06,921 --> 01:03:08,421
(The director has left the room.)

1802
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:09,591
What is this?

1803
01:03:10,151 --> 01:03:11,160
What's this?

1804
01:03:11,161 --> 01:03:13,561
(Only the team members are here. Why are they even here?)

1805
01:03:15,328 --> 01:03:17,568
Can you hear me?

1806
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:19,638
Please take off your eye masks.

1807
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:21,708
What's going on?

1808
01:03:21,709 --> 01:03:23,884
(Taking their eye masks off as per the director's guide)

1809
01:03:23,908 --> 01:03:25,838
(Spotting something)

1810
01:03:25,978 --> 01:03:28,408
(A walkie-talkie and a sheet of paper)

1811
01:03:28,678 --> 01:03:29,907
"Complete the passcode..."

1812
01:03:29,908 --> 01:03:31,254
- "after finding the balloon."
- What is it?

1813
01:03:31,278 --> 01:03:33,718
- "Happy?"
- This is...

1814
01:03:33,918 --> 01:03:36,087
This is like that escape room game.

1815
01:03:36,088 --> 01:03:37,357
(Complete the passcode after finding the balloon.)

1816
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:40,858
(What on earth is happening?)

1817
01:03:41,558 --> 01:03:44,098
- Do we bring this out?
- Tonight's sleeping game is...

1818
01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:46,657
The Great Midnight Escape.

1819
01:03:46,658 --> 01:03:48,997
(Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors, The Great Midnight Escape)

1820
01:03:48,998 --> 01:03:51,097
- This is the answer.
- Right, you got that.

1821
01:03:51,098 --> 01:03:53,767
You have to get out of this building within 15 minutes.

1822
01:03:53,768 --> 01:03:55,108
It's a group mission.

1823
01:03:55,468 --> 01:03:57,278
There is only one way out.

1824
01:03:57,538 --> 01:04:00,248
The door only opens when you complete the passcode.

1825
01:04:01,178 --> 01:04:03,648
- You all got a photo, right?
- Yes.

1826
01:04:05,218 --> 01:04:07,858
Sneak past the surveillance cameras in the second-floor terrace...

1827
01:04:08,418 --> 01:04:10,188
to find three keys.

1828
01:04:11,088 --> 01:04:14,428
You can stick the alphabets hidden in the room onto the window.

1829
01:04:14,888 --> 01:04:16,688
We have to look for "Happy New Year."

1830
01:04:16,788 --> 01:04:18,297
So we have to look for "Happy New Year," right?

1831
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:20,468
(As they stick all the alphabet balloons, )

1832
01:04:20,698 --> 01:04:23,598
(the locked exit door opens.)

1833
01:04:23,638 --> 01:04:25,337
For your reference,

1834
01:04:25,338 --> 01:04:27,738
the surveillance cameras take photos every five seconds.

1835
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:30,207
Those whose photos are taken...

1836
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:32,708
get eliminated right away.

1837
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:35,248
Where are the surveillance cameras?

1838
01:04:35,478 --> 01:04:38,348
Did you see the photo? It's taken by the surveillance camera.

1839
01:04:39,018 --> 01:04:41,588
So we can't be in the photo.

1840
01:04:42,848 --> 01:04:43,887
(Where the team is)

1841
01:04:43,888 --> 01:04:45,817
(They should complete the passcode while avoiding the camera.)

1842
01:04:45,818 --> 01:04:48,357
(Exit)

1843
01:04:48,358 --> 01:04:50,297
(They have to get out through the exit on the 1st floor.)

1844
01:04:50,298 --> 01:04:53,727
Everyone in the team gets to sleep indoors...

1845
01:04:53,728 --> 01:04:56,167
even only one person completes the mission with the time limit.

1846
01:04:56,168 --> 01:04:58,314
So we all get to sleep indoors even if only one person gets it.

1847
01:04:58,338 --> 01:05:00,538
- So we have to make this.
- When the siren rings,

1848
01:05:01,008 --> 01:05:04,408
the 15-minute timer starts. I wish you all good luck.

1849
01:05:05,338 --> 01:05:09,278
(Can they get out of the building in just 15 minutes?)

1850
01:05:09,408 --> 01:05:11,747
(Strategy time)

1851
01:05:11,748 --> 01:05:13,724
You should say a word as you're the leader of "The Great Escape."

1852
01:05:13,748 --> 01:05:15,218
- Focus now.
- Look.

1853
01:05:15,718 --> 01:05:19,018
We have to look for a place where we can hide in five seconds.

1854
01:05:19,188 --> 01:05:21,657
- We have to lie face down.
- Right, whether you do that...

1855
01:05:21,658 --> 01:05:24,727
We have to look for a place to hide within five seconds.

1856
01:05:24,728 --> 01:05:26,898
- We can only move there.
- Right.

1857
01:05:27,598 --> 01:05:29,467
(Surveillance camera simulation)

1858
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:31,237
- Five seconds...
- "Click."

1859
01:05:31,238 --> 01:05:33,097
- Like this.
- We have to move really fast.

1860
01:05:33,098 --> 01:05:34,107
Hiding within five seconds.

1861
01:05:34,108 --> 01:05:35,644
- We have to move really fast.
- Right.

1862
01:05:35,668 --> 01:05:37,407
DinDin should stick the balloons.

1863
01:05:37,408 --> 01:05:39,608
Jong Min doesn't know the spelling of "Happy New Year."

1864
01:05:40,178 --> 01:05:43,107
- Okay?
- I'm not sure with "year."

1865
01:05:43,108 --> 01:05:45,077
- Actually, me too. It's hard.
- "Year" is hard.

1866
01:05:45,078 --> 01:05:47,288
- Does "a" come first or "e?"
- As much as possible...

1867
01:05:47,418 --> 01:05:50,318
It's also dangerous here because of the stairs.

1868
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:51,988
It's taken on the stairs as well.

1869
01:05:52,488 --> 01:05:55,127
You have to be safe and go in deeper.

1870
01:05:55,128 --> 01:05:56,358
- Deep inside here.
- Right.

1871
01:05:56,528 --> 01:05:58,027
You have to climb up the stairs quickly.

1872
01:05:58,028 --> 01:05:59,698
You have to lie down.

1873
01:05:59,798 --> 01:06:02,128
Let's first go to the room and get the balloons.

1874
01:06:02,828 --> 01:06:04,897
Let's find the key, then the balloons.

1875
01:06:04,898 --> 01:06:06,367
(To do list: 1. Find the key, 2. Bring the balloons, )

1876
01:06:06,368 --> 01:06:08,208
(3. Stick the balloons, 4. Escape)

1877
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:10,337
Shall we cheer for ourselves and head out?

1878
01:06:10,338 --> 01:06:12,078
(What will happen to the members?)

1879
01:06:12,178 --> 01:06:14,107
- We're here now.
- Yes.

1880
01:06:14,108 --> 01:06:15,208
We're here.

1881
01:06:15,508 --> 01:06:17,147
- Where?
- We're here now.

1882
01:06:17,148 --> 01:06:18,317
- There are no cameras here.
- Let's save one person.

1883
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:20,198
- We're here.
- Let's save at least one person.

1884
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:21,518
Be careful.

1885
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,187
Don't try to be clever and crouch for no reason.

1886
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:24,457
- Just lie down.
- But...

1887
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:25,657
you have to go to the center and go down.

1888
01:06:25,658 --> 01:06:27,087
I can't lie down because I'm wearing white.

1889
01:06:27,088 --> 01:06:28,487
It doesn't matter.

1890
01:06:28,488 --> 01:06:29,488
I'm wearing white clothes.

1891
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:30,598
(Siren blaring)

1892
01:06:31,428 --> 01:06:33,188
(The siren signals the start of the escape.)

1893
01:06:33,828 --> 01:06:36,298
(The 15-minute timer starts.)

1894
01:06:36,968 --> 01:06:38,168
Go.

1895
01:06:39,138 --> 01:06:40,197
Go.

1896
01:06:40,198 --> 01:06:42,568
(Running)

1897
01:06:42,868 --> 01:06:45,978
(The 6 escapees quickly leave the room.)

1898
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,018
(Lying down)

1899
01:06:54,018 --> 01:06:55,048
Nice.

1900
01:06:58,888 --> 01:07:02,828
(Searching for escapees)

1901
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:05,928
(It's all clear.)

1902
01:07:06,328 --> 01:07:10,298
(They'll be captured if they get spotted even once.)

1903
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,868
- We shouldn't move now.
- We shouldn't move.

1904
01:07:15,338 --> 01:07:18,277
(The 5-second count starts again.)

1905
01:07:18,278 --> 01:07:19,638
Lie down!

1906
01:07:21,148 --> 01:07:22,608
Lie down!

1907
01:07:24,078 --> 01:07:26,548
(The 6 escapees quickly hide before the picture is taken.)

1908
01:07:26,648 --> 01:07:28,717
It goes 5 times. The clock ticks 5 times.

1909
01:07:28,718 --> 01:07:30,388
(Their current location)

1910
01:07:30,518 --> 01:07:32,258
(When they hear the ticking, )

1911
01:07:32,358 --> 01:07:35,827
(they run...)

1912
01:07:35,828 --> 01:07:38,328
(and disappear.)

1913
01:07:38,528 --> 01:07:40,357
(Ticking)

1914
01:07:40,358 --> 01:07:41,427
Lie down!

1915
01:07:41,428 --> 01:07:43,298
(Se Yoon's camera)

1916
01:07:43,568 --> 01:07:45,038
Why aren't you getting down?

1917
01:07:45,498 --> 01:07:48,438
(A breathless escape scene of repeated running and hiding)

1918
01:07:48,568 --> 01:07:50,238
There are balloons on the ceiling.

1919
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:52,078
It could be one of these.

1920
01:07:52,478 --> 01:07:54,307
- Where?
- Wouldn't there be a hint?

1921
01:07:54,308 --> 01:07:55,508
There's a key there.

1922
01:07:56,108 --> 01:07:57,418
Right. It's over there.

1923
01:07:57,578 --> 01:07:59,278
(Among the many balloons, )

1924
01:07:59,318 --> 01:08:01,588
(they find the key.)

1925
01:08:02,048 --> 01:08:05,088
(The key to the chrysanthemum room is stuck to the ceiling.)

1926
01:08:05,318 --> 01:08:06,487
- Where?
- Right. It's up there.

1927
01:08:06,488 --> 01:08:08,087
Get the key quickly.

1928
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:09,387
(Jumping)

1929
01:08:09,388 --> 01:08:10,497
Lie down.

1930
01:08:10,498 --> 01:08:13,658
(They don't have enough time to get the key.)

1931
01:08:14,668 --> 01:08:15,967
I'll get it.

1932
01:08:15,968 --> 01:08:17,128
Get it.

1933
01:08:17,368 --> 01:08:19,398
You have to move, Jong Min. Who are you?

1934
01:08:19,598 --> 01:08:20,638
Are you Joon?

1935
01:08:22,438 --> 01:08:23,938
(Seon Ho jumps.)

1936
01:08:25,278 --> 01:08:26,308
(He gets the key.)

1937
01:08:28,278 --> 01:08:32,718
(DinDin runs to the other side in the mean time.)

1938
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:35,288
Where is the chrysanthemum room?

1939
01:08:36,288 --> 01:08:38,057
(DinDin's camera)

1940
01:08:38,058 --> 01:08:39,788
It's here. Throw it.

1941
01:08:40,258 --> 01:08:42,288
- Where are you?
- I'm here. Throw it here.

1942
01:08:42,858 --> 01:08:43,998
Where?

1943
01:08:44,698 --> 01:08:46,798
(He passes the key.)

1944
01:08:48,998 --> 01:08:51,268
(It comes right in front of him.)

1945
01:08:51,338 --> 01:08:52,397
(DinDin's camera)

1946
01:08:52,398 --> 01:08:53,567
(Ticking)

1947
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:54,767
(He quickly gets the key.)

1948
01:08:54,768 --> 01:08:56,468
- Go downstairs, Seon Ho.
- Okay.

1949
01:08:57,308 --> 01:08:59,738
(He safely gets to the chrysanthemum room.)

1950
01:09:00,008 --> 01:09:04,648
(Chrysanthemum room)

1951
01:09:04,948 --> 01:09:09,288
(Moving quickly and accurately)

1952
01:09:13,258 --> 01:09:17,798
(Meanwhile, Sae Ho and Joon ran to the 1st floor first.)

1953
01:09:17,928 --> 01:09:19,857
(He stops in the middle.)

1954
01:09:19,858 --> 01:09:21,098
It's fine.

1955
01:09:21,598 --> 01:09:22,628
Wait. Stop.

1956
01:09:26,438 --> 01:09:28,507
(They get to the dangerous stair section...)

1957
01:09:28,508 --> 01:09:31,578
(they worried about during the strategy meeting.)

1958
01:09:31,638 --> 01:09:32,777
I'll go down this time...

1959
01:09:32,778 --> 01:09:34,607
- and get down.
- Where is the chrysanthemum room?

1960
01:09:34,608 --> 01:09:36,248
(Sae Ho's camera)

1961
01:09:36,778 --> 01:09:39,278
(With the ticking sound, he runs down.)

1962
01:09:41,988 --> 01:09:45,518
(He makes it there safely by throwing himself down.)

1963
01:09:45,688 --> 01:09:49,258
(Going back and forth)

1964
01:09:50,028 --> 01:09:52,028
(Joon is left alone.)

1965
01:09:55,928 --> 01:09:59,198
(He lands by throwing himself down like Sae Ho.)

1966
01:09:59,498 --> 01:10:01,968
(His timing to hide was a bit off.)

1967
01:10:02,038 --> 01:10:04,037
(The security camera shot)

1968
01:10:04,038 --> 01:10:05,907
(Joon was spotted.)

1969
01:10:05,908 --> 01:10:07,377
Lee Joon captured.

1970
01:10:07,378 --> 01:10:08,408
What?

1971
01:10:11,078 --> 01:10:12,478
Lee Joon captured.

1972
01:10:12,578 --> 01:10:13,578
What?

1973
01:10:16,348 --> 01:10:17,358
What?

1974
01:10:18,588 --> 01:10:19,618
What happened?

1975
01:10:20,488 --> 01:10:21,928
Lee Joon captured.

1976
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:22,958
What?

1977
01:10:24,528 --> 01:10:29,468
(Joon was trusted, but he goes out early.)

1978
01:10:31,738 --> 01:10:32,798
What?

1979
01:10:33,838 --> 01:10:35,567
(He's taken away immediately.)

1980
01:10:35,568 --> 01:10:37,267
Sae Ho. This makes no sense.

1981
01:10:37,268 --> 01:10:40,508
(He's taken away immediately.)

1982
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:43,777
What is this?

1983
01:10:43,778 --> 01:10:45,577
(He can't believe it.)

1984
01:10:45,578 --> 01:10:46,648
This...

1985
01:10:47,278 --> 01:10:49,618
(Lee Jun captured at 12 minutes 30 seconds.)

1986
01:10:49,748 --> 01:10:51,217
Lee Joon captured.

1987
01:10:51,218 --> 01:10:52,358
- What?
- What?

1988
01:10:52,788 --> 01:10:53,817
What?

1989
01:10:53,818 --> 01:10:56,234
(People on the 2nd floor are shocked by Joon's early capture.)

1990
01:10:56,258 --> 01:10:57,457
Where did he get captured?

1991
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:58,758
Don't get flustered.

1992
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:01,198
- You have to go down.
- Okay.

1993
01:11:01,468 --> 01:11:02,927
I'm at the stairs. I'll go.

1994
01:11:02,928 --> 01:11:03,928
Should I go?

1995
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:05,797
No. Se Yoon can go.

1996
01:11:05,798 --> 01:11:06,898
I'll go.

1997
01:11:08,408 --> 01:11:11,838
(Se Yoon comes to help the 1st floor.)

1998
01:11:12,278 --> 01:11:14,107
(DinDin's quick judgment clears the confusion.)

1999
01:11:14,108 --> 01:11:15,508
I found one here.

2000
01:11:16,178 --> 01:11:17,778
Where is it? Where is the key?

2001
01:11:18,178 --> 01:11:19,248
Where is the key?

2002
01:11:19,478 --> 01:11:21,288
Do you see it there? Over there.

2003
01:11:21,518 --> 01:11:23,448
The karaoke room. We have to open this one.

2004
01:11:23,618 --> 01:11:26,858
(The karaoke room key is attached.)

2005
01:11:26,988 --> 01:11:30,328
(But it's outside the window.)

2006
01:11:30,388 --> 01:11:31,658
- We have to open this.
- Okay.

2007
01:11:33,258 --> 01:11:36,868
(Time to move)

2008
01:11:37,468 --> 01:11:41,768
(Seon Ho calmly opens the window first.)

2009
01:11:42,168 --> 01:11:46,138
(DinDin opens the chrysanthemum room door.)

2010
01:11:47,948 --> 01:11:49,048
Is there something inside?

2011
01:11:49,178 --> 01:11:50,548
- Happy.
- Okay.

2012
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:54,948
(They get the balloons for "Happy.")

2013
01:11:57,618 --> 01:11:59,718
(He also easily gets the karaoke room keys.)

2014
01:11:59,818 --> 01:12:01,257
Where is the karaoke room?

2015
01:12:01,258 --> 01:12:03,958
(Thanks to their work, the 2nd-floor mission is going smoothly.)

2016
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:07,198
(At the same time)

2017
01:12:10,468 --> 01:12:12,097
(Sae Ho was left alone on the 1st floor...)

2018
01:12:12,098 --> 01:12:13,297
It's not here.

2019
01:12:13,298 --> 01:12:14,938
(after Lee Joon's capture.)

2020
01:12:15,308 --> 01:12:19,478
(He finds the keys on the restaurant floor.)

2021
01:12:19,508 --> 01:12:23,408
(A bunch of keys labeled "linen room")

2022
01:12:24,778 --> 01:12:27,748
(He quickly takes it.)

2023
01:12:29,088 --> 01:12:30,617
Where is the linen room?

2024
01:12:30,618 --> 01:12:32,017
Linen room.

2025
01:12:32,018 --> 01:12:33,088
It's upstairs.

2026
01:12:33,918 --> 01:12:35,728
Se Yoon captured.

2027
01:12:36,488 --> 01:12:37,688
I guess your head was spotted.

2028
01:12:37,898 --> 01:12:38,898
Why?

2029
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:44,028
(He threw himself down the stairs to help Sae Ho.)

2030
01:12:44,498 --> 01:12:46,637
(A 120kg dive)

2031
01:12:46,638 --> 01:12:48,567
(The security camera shot)

2032
01:12:48,568 --> 01:12:51,338
(His entire body was captured.)

2033
01:12:53,608 --> 01:12:55,708
(Running away)

2034
01:12:56,008 --> 01:12:59,418
(I need to help my friend Sae Ho!)

2035
01:12:59,978 --> 01:13:00,988
Sae Ho!

2036
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:02,648
Stay alive!

2037
01:13:02,948 --> 01:13:04,158
You should stay alive!

2038
01:13:04,688 --> 01:13:06,287
Where is the linen room?

2039
01:13:06,288 --> 01:13:07,628
(The lone hunter is alone again.)

2040
01:13:07,988 --> 01:13:09,288
Why are you here?

2041
01:13:09,588 --> 01:13:12,098
(It's an emergency.)

2042
01:13:12,328 --> 01:13:14,968
(In this large building, )

2043
01:13:16,198 --> 01:13:17,698
(the only codes they acquired...)

2044
01:13:18,738 --> 01:13:20,908
(are "Happy.")

2045
01:13:21,568 --> 01:13:22,637
Sae Ho!

2046
01:13:22,638 --> 01:13:25,108
(They only have 10 minutes left.)

2047
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:31,478
(DinDin found the balloons in the chrysanthemum room.)

2048
01:13:31,948 --> 01:13:33,518
Where is it?

2049
01:13:35,118 --> 01:13:36,817
(To find the place to stick the balloons...)

2050
01:13:36,818 --> 01:13:38,018
It wasn't here.

2051
01:13:39,258 --> 01:13:40,258
(He joins the others.)

2052
01:13:40,259 --> 01:13:41,388
Where is the key?

2053
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,427
Go inside that room.

2054
01:13:43,428 --> 01:13:45,157
- There was "Happy" there.
- Okay.

2055
01:13:45,158 --> 01:13:46,727
I brought "h" and "a."

2056
01:13:46,728 --> 01:13:48,498
Right. Should I bring the rest?

2057
01:13:48,968 --> 01:13:50,798
(Jong Min)

2058
01:13:50,838 --> 01:13:52,138
(Jong Min's camera)

2059
01:13:52,938 --> 01:13:54,138
(Laughing)

2060
01:13:54,368 --> 01:13:56,138
(Banging)

2061
01:13:56,268 --> 01:13:59,038
(He reached the chrysanthemum room without getting caught!)

2062
01:13:59,278 --> 01:14:00,278
Sae Ho!

2063
01:14:01,308 --> 01:14:03,847
(He starts looking for the place...)

2064
01:14:03,848 --> 01:14:05,748
(to stick the balloons.)

2065
01:14:06,548 --> 01:14:07,718
Sae Ho!

2066
01:14:08,188 --> 01:14:10,188
Look for the linen room.

2067
01:14:10,218 --> 01:14:11,288
It's here. Why?

2068
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:12,517
I found the keys.

2069
01:14:12,518 --> 01:14:14,318
I found a key as well. We found all the keys.

2070
01:14:14,388 --> 01:14:17,527
(Linen room keys, karaoke room key)

2071
01:14:17,528 --> 01:14:19,497
Did you find where the linen room is?

2072
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:20,798
We found all the keys.

2073
01:14:21,328 --> 01:14:25,168
(We'll reveal it to the viewers first.)

2074
01:14:25,268 --> 01:14:27,867
(The linen room is on the 2nd floor and the karaoke room on the 1st.)

2075
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:31,837
(Linen room key: first floor, karaoke room key: second floor)

2076
01:14:31,838 --> 01:14:35,508
(They both have to go to different floors.)

2077
01:14:35,978 --> 01:14:38,347
(They have to go through the tough staircase section.)

2078
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:40,518
Do you have the keys, Seon Ho?

2079
01:14:41,218 --> 01:14:42,387
Throw the karaoke room keys downstairs.

2080
01:14:42,388 --> 01:14:43,518
Sae Ho.

2081
01:14:43,548 --> 01:14:44,957
Throw the karaoke room keys downstairs.

2082
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:46,788
(Sae Ho asks for the karaoke room keys.)

2083
01:14:47,118 --> 01:14:50,898
(When Lee Joon got caught, )

2084
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:54,197
(Sae Ho looked around the 1st floor.)

2085
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,628
(As Joon was being dragged out...)

2086
01:14:58,068 --> 01:15:01,038
(Sae Ho found the signboard.)

2087
01:15:01,738 --> 01:15:05,178
(Why is there a karaoke room here?)

2088
01:15:05,978 --> 01:15:07,438
You can just throw it here.

2089
01:15:08,808 --> 01:15:10,977
(Seon Ho heads to meet him immediately.)

2090
01:15:10,978 --> 01:15:12,147
Throw it!

2091
01:15:12,148 --> 01:15:13,718
- Where are you? Okay.
- Here.

2092
01:15:13,778 --> 01:15:14,818
You can throw it.

2093
01:15:15,488 --> 01:15:17,147
(He passes it.)

2094
01:15:17,148 --> 01:15:18,888
(He catches it.)

2095
01:15:21,788 --> 01:15:22,788
Sae Ho.

2096
01:15:23,188 --> 01:15:24,698
- Yes?
- What keys do you have?

2097
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:26,028
Linen room.

2098
01:15:26,198 --> 01:15:27,598
- Linen?
- Yes.

2099
01:15:28,698 --> 01:15:31,838
(Look for the linen room!)

2100
01:15:36,138 --> 01:15:37,708
(Peeking)

2101
01:15:39,408 --> 01:15:41,347
(Linen room)

2102
01:15:41,348 --> 01:15:43,848
(Is it over there?)

2103
01:15:44,778 --> 01:15:47,148
(Sae Ho was crawling around looking for the karaoke room.)

2104
01:15:48,088 --> 01:15:50,588
(He made it to the front of the karaoke room signboard.)

2105
01:15:51,058 --> 01:15:53,558
(The karaoke room is deep inside.)

2106
01:15:55,388 --> 01:15:59,857
(Sae Ho's camera)

2107
01:15:59,858 --> 01:16:01,728
(Sighing)

2108
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:10,438
(He got down a bit late!)

2109
01:16:10,568 --> 01:16:13,908
(The ones who were watching...)

2110
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:15,438
You have to duck down, Sae Ho!

2111
01:16:16,248 --> 01:16:18,117
- Gosh!
- Gosh.

2112
01:16:18,118 --> 01:16:19,348
Gosh, Cho Sae Ho.

2113
01:16:19,718 --> 01:16:22,118
He got caught. I'm 100 percent certain.

2114
01:16:22,148 --> 01:16:23,587
(However...)

2115
01:16:23,588 --> 01:16:25,187
(Karaoke room)

2116
01:16:25,188 --> 01:16:27,287
(CCTV photo)

2117
01:16:27,288 --> 01:16:30,728
(Sae Ho didn't get caught as he got down late!)

2118
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,104
- He didn't get caught?
- Sae Ho didn't get caught.

2119
01:16:33,128 --> 01:16:34,728
All right. Go.

2120
01:16:35,168 --> 01:16:36,168
Go!

2121
01:16:37,428 --> 01:16:38,697
(He tries to open the karaoke room once again.)

2122
01:16:38,698 --> 01:16:40,138
- Get down!
- Get down!

2123
01:16:43,038 --> 01:16:46,237
(Sae Ho obtains the NEW balloons.)

2124
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:48,608
(Sae Ho's camera)

2125
01:16:49,078 --> 01:16:52,048
(He must pick up the balloons...)

2126
01:16:54,178 --> 01:16:56,717
(and go up to the 2nd floor to put them up!)

2127
01:16:56,718 --> 01:16:59,458
(Sae Ho cam)

2128
01:16:59,488 --> 01:17:00,558
Get down!

2129
01:17:02,128 --> 01:17:03,858
- Seon Ho!
- Yes?

2130
01:17:04,028 --> 01:17:05,157
I found the balloons!

2131
01:17:05,158 --> 01:17:06,298
I'll be there.

2132
01:17:06,928 --> 01:17:07,967
Seon Ho!

2133
01:17:07,968 --> 01:17:11,338
(The three idiots are still looking for the linen room.)

2134
01:17:11,468 --> 01:17:13,238
- Go down, Seon Ho.
- Okay.

2135
01:17:15,108 --> 01:17:17,778
(He heads to the 1st floor at Sae Ho's call.)

2136
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:23,247
Get down!

2137
01:17:23,248 --> 01:17:24,378
(Plopping down)

2138
01:17:25,148 --> 01:17:26,148
It's "NEW."

2139
01:17:26,418 --> 01:17:27,448
Okay.

2140
01:17:27,818 --> 01:17:28,938
You have to go up this time.

2141
01:17:29,448 --> 01:17:30,547
Okay. What do I take with me?

2142
01:17:30,548 --> 01:17:31,617
- All three of them?
- Yes.

2143
01:17:31,618 --> 01:17:32,778
(Seon Ho takes the balloons.)

2144
01:17:32,888 --> 01:17:34,288
- You missed it?
- I missed it.

2145
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:36,028
You don't need the key to the linen room?

2146
01:17:36,358 --> 01:17:37,388
It's right back there.

2147
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,197
- Really?
- I'll take it. You go up.

2148
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:42,428
(Sae Ho will take the key to the linen room.)

2149
01:17:42,928 --> 01:17:45,198
(Seon Ho)

2150
01:17:46,568 --> 01:17:48,008
(Slipping)

2151
01:17:48,108 --> 01:17:50,708
(He slipped!)

2152
01:17:54,778 --> 01:17:57,178
(Picking up the linen room key)

2153
01:17:57,818 --> 01:17:59,818
Sae Ho, the linen room is to the left upstairs.

2154
01:18:00,548 --> 01:18:01,687
- What?
- Go up...

2155
01:18:01,688 --> 01:18:03,348
and go to the left for the linen room.

2156
01:18:04,418 --> 01:18:06,718
(They head to the 2nd floor.)

2157
01:18:11,128 --> 01:18:12,527
(That hurts.)

2158
01:18:12,528 --> 01:18:13,627
Did you get it?

2159
01:18:13,628 --> 01:18:14,897
- You go first.
- Okay.

2160
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,468
(Sae Ho heads to the linen room first.)

2161
01:18:19,538 --> 01:18:20,737
But why are there so many keys?

2162
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:21,908
Gosh, what?

2163
01:18:23,108 --> 01:18:26,178
(They finally notice the different keys!)

2164
01:18:27,108 --> 01:18:30,308
(There are only 6 minutes left.)

2165
01:18:30,478 --> 01:18:31,518
Why aren't you going?

2166
01:18:36,648 --> 01:18:38,988
(They join DinDin.)

2167
01:18:40,358 --> 01:18:42,088
- We got everything. The balloons.
- Right.

2168
01:18:42,228 --> 01:18:43,828
(Please!)

2169
01:18:45,758 --> 01:18:46,857
We got everything, right?

2170
01:18:46,858 --> 01:18:47,897
(The 1st attempt at opening the linen room is a failure.)

2171
01:18:47,898 --> 01:18:48,928
Here.

2172
01:18:53,898 --> 01:18:54,938
Get down.

2173
01:18:55,708 --> 01:18:57,067
Why are there so many keys?

2174
01:18:57,068 --> 01:18:58,277
(The 2nd attempt at opening the linen room is a failure.)

2175
01:18:58,278 --> 01:19:00,438
Gosh, what do we do with the keys?

2176
01:19:02,048 --> 01:19:03,447
(They should start with putting up the balloons they got.)

2177
01:19:03,448 --> 01:19:04,677
Should we try to use all of them?

2178
01:19:04,678 --> 01:19:07,277
(They should start with putting up the balloons they got.)

2179
01:19:07,278 --> 01:19:08,947
- Hold on.
- Where are the sticky notes?

2180
01:19:08,948 --> 01:19:11,288
Is there a sticky note there, Seon Ho?

2181
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:13,117
I'll check. I'll look for it.

2182
01:19:13,118 --> 01:19:14,757
- I don't know which one it is.
- I'll look.

2183
01:19:14,758 --> 01:19:16,027
(Seon Ho looks for the starting point for the balloons.)

2184
01:19:16,028 --> 01:19:17,788
Hey, did you find all of the letters?

2185
01:19:18,028 --> 01:19:19,728
- It's right here. H is here.
- Get down.

2186
01:19:19,898 --> 01:19:21,468
(Seon Ho's camera)

2187
01:19:22,228 --> 01:19:23,698
(He spots it.)

2188
01:19:24,768 --> 01:19:26,538
- It's right here. H is here.
- Get down.

2189
01:19:26,968 --> 01:19:28,408
- Is H there?
- Yes.

2190
01:19:30,438 --> 01:19:31,637
- Is H there?
- Yes.

2191
01:19:31,638 --> 01:19:33,107
You put it up. I'll open the linen room.

2192
01:19:33,108 --> 01:19:34,807
- How do I put it up?
- Bring that, Jong Min.

2193
01:19:34,808 --> 01:19:36,207
- Put up H.
- There.

2194
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:38,477
- It's right there.
- Okay.

2195
01:19:38,478 --> 01:19:41,718
(DinDin tries to open the linen room.)

2196
01:19:42,188 --> 01:19:43,548
- That's we'll do.
- Right.

2197
01:19:43,688 --> 01:19:45,357
- You have to come here, Jong Min.
- Right.

2198
01:19:45,358 --> 01:19:46,594
(He checks the keys carefully.)

2199
01:19:46,618 --> 01:19:47,988
H and A are here?

2200
01:19:48,188 --> 01:19:50,858
(He tries putting in one of the keys.)

2201
01:19:52,198 --> 01:19:53,627
It went in!

2202
01:19:53,628 --> 01:19:54,928
You can come. It's okay.

2203
01:19:55,168 --> 01:19:56,568
- Should I go up higher?
- Yes.

2204
01:19:57,398 --> 01:19:59,838
(The linen room has opened.)

2205
01:20:00,938 --> 01:20:02,108
Gosh, who is it?

2206
01:20:02,938 --> 01:20:04,167
- Like this.
- Okay.

2207
01:20:04,168 --> 01:20:05,807
(Jong Min's camera)

2208
01:20:05,808 --> 01:20:07,377
- P.
- What's this?

2209
01:20:07,378 --> 01:20:08,498
It's out of air. What is it?

2210
01:20:09,308 --> 01:20:13,278
(DinDin finds the balloons for YEAR.)

2211
01:20:13,418 --> 01:20:15,147
I think it should go up higher.

2212
01:20:15,148 --> 01:20:16,418
- Should I go up higher?
- Yes.

2213
01:20:17,088 --> 01:20:18,158
Gosh, who is it?

2214
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:20,118
- Like this.
- Okay.

2215
01:20:21,058 --> 01:20:22,227
(The position for H is off!)

2216
01:20:22,228 --> 01:20:23,628
Give me P.

2217
01:20:29,068 --> 01:20:30,428
It's too short.

2218
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:34,738
(Focused to the max)

2219
01:20:34,868 --> 01:20:36,068
How much time do we have left?

2220
01:20:37,068 --> 01:20:39,037
(Thrown from the inside...)

2221
01:20:39,038 --> 01:20:41,648
(and put up from the outside)

2222
01:20:41,808 --> 01:20:45,548
(CCTV photo)

2223
01:20:49,218 --> 01:20:50,317
(They manage to get all of the balloons.)

2224
01:20:50,318 --> 01:20:51,388
Here.

2225
01:20:52,218 --> 01:20:53,698
- Gosh.
- We have to get out as well.

2226
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:58,228
(The password must be completed.)

2227
01:20:58,229 --> 01:21:00,298
H, A, P, P...

2228
01:21:01,798 --> 01:21:02,828
What?

2229
01:21:02,898 --> 01:21:04,428
Just finish "YEAR."

2230
01:21:04,598 --> 01:21:06,638
Y after the space.

2231
01:21:06,738 --> 01:21:08,537
Here. Go across.

2232
01:21:08,538 --> 01:21:09,867
Hurry!

2233
01:21:09,868 --> 01:21:11,808
(Seon Ho is in charge of YEAR.)

2234
01:21:11,838 --> 01:21:14,607
Where is the space before YEAR?

2235
01:21:14,608 --> 01:21:16,478
- Y?
- APP.

2236
01:21:16,608 --> 01:21:18,448
- Space, NEW, space, YEAR.
- Y.

2237
01:21:18,678 --> 01:21:19,777
It's there after moving over one.

2238
01:21:19,778 --> 01:21:21,848
- Here?
- The one next to that.

2239
01:21:21,988 --> 01:21:24,088
(He almost put it up in the wrong position!)

2240
01:21:24,248 --> 01:21:25,858
- N.
- Hold on.

2241
01:21:26,488 --> 01:21:27,688
I think this is N.

2242
01:21:28,858 --> 01:21:29,958
N, E.

2243
01:21:30,528 --> 01:21:34,197
(The three do their best to sleep indoors.)

2244
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:35,328
Sae Ho.

2245
01:21:35,898 --> 01:21:36,927
(Sae Ho finishes up to W with NEW.)

2246
01:21:36,928 --> 01:21:38,338
- Down!
- Gosh!

2247
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:43,468
(The only letters left are Seon Ho's YEAR!)

2248
01:21:45,438 --> 01:21:46,638
Just put up R now.

2249
01:21:48,448 --> 01:21:50,347
You have to go now!

2250
01:21:50,348 --> 01:21:51,417
Done.

2251
01:21:51,418 --> 01:21:53,217
You have to go now!

2252
01:21:53,218 --> 01:21:54,218
Done.

2253
01:21:54,478 --> 01:21:55,518
Go!

2254
01:21:56,118 --> 01:21:57,488
Watch out.

2255
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:58,987
N!

2256
01:21:58,988 --> 01:22:01,358
(N is put up incorrectly.)

2257
01:22:02,888 --> 01:22:03,927
N!

2258
01:22:03,928 --> 01:22:06,227
(The problematic N is spotted even from prison.)

2259
01:22:06,228 --> 01:22:07,328
N!

2260
01:22:07,658 --> 01:22:09,867
- Sae Ho. N.
- N?

2261
01:22:09,868 --> 01:22:12,267
- Okay.
- N to the other side.

2262
01:22:12,268 --> 01:22:14,444
(He sends the message right away after hearing from Joon.)

2263
01:22:14,468 --> 01:22:15,538
The exit!

2264
01:22:15,668 --> 01:22:19,738
(It's still wrong when flipped by 180°.)

2265
01:22:19,878 --> 01:22:23,108
(Sae Ho feels rushed.)

2266
01:22:23,808 --> 01:22:25,648
It fell. It can't be helped.

2267
01:22:25,718 --> 01:22:28,317
(His desperate figure gets caught in the photo.)

2268
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:29,348
Hold on!

2269
01:22:29,588 --> 01:22:30,948
- Sae Ho is arrested.
- Sae Ho!

2270
01:22:32,418 --> 01:22:33,657
I'll just put it up here.

2271
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:35,728
(He makes a disappointing leave at the very end.)

2272
01:22:36,028 --> 01:22:37,258
It's falling off.

2273
01:22:37,428 --> 01:22:40,297
(Who knew N would cause this much trouble?)

2274
01:22:40,298 --> 01:22:41,368
Hold on.

2275
01:22:41,628 --> 01:22:44,027
- You did well.
- You did well.

2276
01:22:44,028 --> 01:22:45,597
- You did well.
- Look at all your sweat.

2277
01:22:45,598 --> 01:22:47,297
I found everything from the linen room and karaoke room.

2278
01:22:47,298 --> 01:22:48,938
- You did more than enough.
- Right.

2279
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:50,408
You did more than enough.

2280
01:22:51,268 --> 01:22:53,008
But what is Jong Min doing?

2281
01:22:53,438 --> 01:22:55,807
(Where on earth is Jong Min?)

2282
01:22:55,808 --> 01:22:57,248
Is Jong Min alive?

2283
01:22:58,918 --> 01:23:00,648
Hey, Seon Ho!

2284
01:23:00,778 --> 01:23:03,448
(What are you doing?)

2285
01:23:03,848 --> 01:23:06,918
(After delivering the last set of balloons)

2286
01:23:07,288 --> 01:23:09,588
One person must survive, at least.

2287
01:23:09,758 --> 01:23:11,758
One person should hide in here. What do you think?

2288
01:23:12,358 --> 01:23:13,498
It's like safety insurance.

2289
01:23:13,858 --> 01:23:15,468
- Will you stay in here then?
- Sure.

2290
01:23:15,598 --> 01:23:17,997
Put up the balloons. Tell me when you get caught.

2291
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:19,314
(Jong Min decided to go with survival.)

2292
01:23:19,338 --> 01:23:20,468
Are you doing well?

2293
01:23:24,568 --> 01:23:26,238
Where's the exit?

2294
01:23:27,508 --> 01:23:31,108
(Cheap Jong Min)

2295
01:23:32,818 --> 01:23:33,917
Okay. Let's look for it.

2296
01:23:33,918 --> 01:23:35,147
Right. Let's look for the exit.

2297
01:23:35,148 --> 01:23:37,117
- Where are you though?
- I'm in the room.

2298
01:23:37,118 --> 01:23:38,257
(The current locations of the survivors)

2299
01:23:38,258 --> 01:23:40,858
(The password is complete if N is put up.)

2300
01:23:42,388 --> 01:23:44,128
It must be on the first floor, right?

2301
01:23:44,798 --> 01:23:46,058
Come out for now.

2302
01:23:46,428 --> 01:23:47,458
Hey!

2303
01:23:47,658 --> 01:23:48,767
(DinDin put up the N correctly.)

2304
01:23:48,768 --> 01:23:49,828
Nice one!

2305
01:23:50,498 --> 01:23:53,368
(The balloon password is finally complete.)

2306
01:23:53,698 --> 01:23:55,668
- You have to come out, Jong Min.
- Okay.

2307
01:23:55,938 --> 01:23:58,068
All right. The exit is open.

2308
01:23:58,578 --> 01:24:00,237
So that's how it's done.

2309
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:03,448
(It's finally time for the exit to open.)

2310
01:24:03,908 --> 01:24:05,017
Where could it be?

2311
01:24:05,018 --> 01:24:06,317
(The CCTV gets turned off as the exit opens.)

2312
01:24:06,318 --> 01:24:07,677
We don't know where the exit is.

2313
01:24:07,678 --> 01:24:09,648
I think it's on the first floor.

2314
01:24:09,848 --> 01:24:11,418
I get that,

2315
01:24:11,818 --> 01:24:13,317
but will we be able to see it?

2316
01:24:13,318 --> 01:24:15,288
I think it's pretty clear where it is.

2317
01:24:16,028 --> 01:24:17,128
I'll take a look.

2318
01:24:17,728 --> 01:24:19,427
(DinDin, Jong Min, Seon Ho)

2319
01:24:19,428 --> 01:24:20,797
I see it. Get down.

2320
01:24:20,798 --> 01:24:21,897
- Can you see it?
- Where is it?

2321
01:24:21,898 --> 01:24:23,128
- Yes.
- Where is it?

2322
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:24,327
Go, Seon Ho.

2323
01:24:24,328 --> 01:24:27,098
(It's all about speed now.)

2324
01:24:28,408 --> 01:24:29,467
(Before the time limit is reached, )

2325
01:24:29,468 --> 01:24:31,037
- Hey!
- Here!

2326
01:24:31,038 --> 01:24:33,378
(find your way out as soon as possible.)

2327
01:24:34,038 --> 01:24:35,408
Okay!

2328
01:24:36,578 --> 01:24:38,007
Did we make it?

2329
01:24:38,008 --> 01:24:39,017
What? Did we make it?

2330
01:24:39,018 --> 01:24:40,154
- Did we make it?
- Let's go!

2331
01:24:40,178 --> 01:24:41,787
You have managed to escape.

2332
01:24:41,788 --> 01:24:42,887
(Seon Ho, DinDin, and Jong Min have managed to escape.)

2333
01:24:42,888 --> 01:24:43,994
- What about the time limit?
- Nice job.

2334
01:24:44,018 --> 01:24:45,217
- Did we do well?
- Did we make it?

2335
01:24:45,218 --> 01:24:46,457
We will check the time.

2336
01:24:46,458 --> 01:24:48,428
- What? Did we make it?
- What happened?

2337
01:24:48,488 --> 01:24:50,088
- All right, everyone.
- Did we make it?

2338
01:24:50,128 --> 01:24:51,928
- You have managed to escape.
- Right.

2339
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:53,627
Isn't it a matter of time?

2340
01:24:53,628 --> 01:24:55,698
- It's a matter of time.
- It was very close.

2341
01:24:55,868 --> 01:24:57,628
- Hold on. Time out. Jong Min!
- Yes?

2342
01:24:58,028 --> 01:24:59,668
Why didn't you come out from the room?

2343
01:24:59,768 --> 01:25:02,838
I made sure I was left if all of you got caught.

2344
01:25:03,338 --> 01:25:05,878
You ran down here after doing nothing in the room?

2345
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:08,348
- Yes.
- Does insurance money move around?

2346
01:25:08,678 --> 01:25:09,778
(Laughing)

2347
01:25:09,978 --> 01:25:11,348
Well done, everyone.

2348
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:14,317
You were all told the time limit was 15 minutes, right?

2349
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,188
- Yes.
- You all have made it...

2350
01:25:16,518 --> 01:25:19,017
- What's our record?
- in 13 minutes and 32 seconds.

2351
01:25:19,018 --> 01:25:20,018
Okay!

2352
01:25:20,258 --> 01:25:22,327
See? We almost used all 15 minutes.

2353
01:25:22,328 --> 01:25:23,357
We almost used up all of the time.

2354
01:25:23,358 --> 01:25:26,027
- Nice one.
- Time went by so quickly.

2355
01:25:26,028 --> 01:25:28,527
(Successfully escaped)

2356
01:25:28,528 --> 01:25:29,767
Three people have survived...

2357
01:25:29,768 --> 01:25:31,738
and you all have cleared the mission.

2358
01:25:32,398 --> 01:25:33,567
All of you get to sleep indoors.

2359
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,838
Nice. In this weather.

2360
01:25:35,538 --> 01:25:38,038
Thank you for your hard work today.

2361
01:25:38,378 --> 01:25:40,007
Hurry and go to bed now.

2362
01:25:40,008 --> 01:25:41,037
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2363
01:25:41,038 --> 01:25:42,247
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2364
01:25:42,248 --> 01:25:44,477
This is great. Thank you.

2365
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:45,817
We get to sleep indoors.

2366
01:25:45,818 --> 01:25:47,348
Get some rest. This is nice.

2367
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:00,428
My goodness. It's been a long day.

2368
01:26:01,328 --> 01:26:03,798
Seriously, since the morning,

2369
01:26:04,398 --> 01:26:05,598
things have been tough, right?

2370
01:26:05,998 --> 01:26:07,597
It's been a long time since we all slept together.

2371
01:26:07,598 --> 01:26:09,008
It's been a really long time.

2372
01:26:09,138 --> 01:26:11,138
We've barely slept together...

2373
01:26:11,468 --> 01:26:13,278
- in 2025.
- Right. It rarely happens.

2374
01:26:14,008 --> 01:26:16,108
Now, we are about to end...

2375
01:26:16,548 --> 01:26:17,848
the last night of 2025.

2376
01:26:17,978 --> 01:26:19,817
Let's get a good energy from the sunrise tomorrow...

2377
01:26:19,818 --> 01:26:22,347
and make the year 2026 more enjoyable...

2378
01:26:22,348 --> 01:26:24,124
- with 2 Days 1 Night.
- That sounds great. Let's do that.

2379
01:26:24,148 --> 01:26:25,718
- Goodnight.
- Let's sleep.

2380
01:26:25,988 --> 01:26:27,687
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

2381
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:28,688
Goodnight.

2382
01:26:30,088 --> 01:26:34,358
(The last night of 2 Days 1 Night in 2025 deepens.)

2383
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:37,767
(The members are still deep in their dreams.)

2384
01:26:37,768 --> 01:26:39,098
(Rattling)

2385
01:26:39,268 --> 01:26:41,168
(Surprised)

2386
01:26:42,268 --> 01:26:45,608
Everyone, wake up.

2387
01:26:45,908 --> 01:26:48,108
(One by one, they begin to wake up.)

2388
01:26:48,678 --> 01:26:51,548
Jong Min, you can't be like this. Wake up.

2389
01:26:51,878 --> 01:26:53,648
(Is it morning already?)

2390
01:26:54,078 --> 01:26:55,148
What?

2391
01:26:55,848 --> 01:26:57,247
Jong Min gets up like a dad.

2392
01:26:57,248 --> 01:26:58,818
Seon Ho, let's go and wash up.

2393
01:26:59,288 --> 01:27:01,187
It's still night.

2394
01:27:01,188 --> 01:27:02,628
(Current time: 5:50am)

2395
01:27:03,088 --> 01:27:06,028
(What are they doing up so early?)

2396
01:27:06,398 --> 01:27:07,398
(Sighing)

2397
01:27:07,828 --> 01:27:10,968
(They woke up again after only 4 hours of sleep.)

2398
01:27:11,098 --> 01:27:14,037
Now, we're going to watch the sunrise.

2399
01:27:14,038 --> 01:27:15,038
- Okay.
- My goodness.

2400
01:27:15,638 --> 01:27:18,138
(We woke them up early to see the sunrise.)

2401
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:19,707
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

2402
01:27:19,708 --> 01:27:21,178
Let's go, guys.

2403
01:27:22,148 --> 01:27:24,278
The moon is truly round today.

2404
01:27:25,118 --> 01:27:27,747
- It's a full moon.
- It looks like it.

2405
01:27:27,748 --> 01:27:29,064
(A full moon as round as the sun)

2406
01:27:29,088 --> 01:27:32,388
(Jong Min is practically sleeping while walking.)

2407
01:27:32,458 --> 01:27:35,158
I think I can sleep here right away.

2408
01:27:35,558 --> 01:27:36,958
- Are you that sleepy?
- Yes.

2409
01:27:37,188 --> 01:27:38,828
If I lay down here, I could fall asleep.

2410
01:27:39,098 --> 01:27:41,428
Then, you might end up waking up somewhere else.

2411
01:27:41,558 --> 01:27:43,527
- Seriously...
- You can't fall asleep.

2412
01:27:43,528 --> 01:27:44,968
(So, wake up, Jong Min.)

2413
01:27:45,068 --> 01:27:46,768
The sun is coming up over there.

2414
01:27:47,338 --> 01:27:49,808
- My goodness.
- It's rising.

2415
01:27:50,168 --> 01:27:51,308
We should hurry.

2416
01:27:51,908 --> 01:27:53,077
(The sky has already taken on a red tinge.)

2417
01:27:53,078 --> 01:27:54,307
It's pretty. Look.

2418
01:27:54,308 --> 01:27:57,407
(They should hurry and go up before the sun rises.)

2419
01:27:57,408 --> 01:27:58,418
It's pretty.

2420
01:27:58,648 --> 01:27:59,648
(Groaning)

2421
01:28:00,248 --> 01:28:02,487
(The path is steeper than they thought.)

2422
01:28:02,488 --> 01:28:03,488
(Groaning)

2423
01:28:04,818 --> 01:28:08,458
(All they can hear is the sound of heavy breathing.)

2424
01:28:09,188 --> 01:28:10,957
- We keep going up.
- We're going up again.

2425
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:13,527
(As they keep going up...)

2426
01:28:13,528 --> 01:28:14,658
I think it's there.

2427
01:28:14,858 --> 01:28:15,928
Boriam.

2428
01:28:16,498 --> 01:28:18,798
This is amazing.

2429
01:28:20,798 --> 01:28:25,838
(They can't help but exclaim the moment they see it.)

2430
01:28:26,638 --> 01:28:29,608
(Boriam Hermitage)

2431
01:28:30,148 --> 01:28:31,777
(Boriam Hermitage is located at the summit of Mount Geum.)

2432
01:28:31,778 --> 01:28:34,247
Everyone, this is where King Taejo Yi Seong Gye...

2433
01:28:34,248 --> 01:28:37,547
came to pray before founding the Joseon Dynasty.

2434
01:28:37,548 --> 01:28:38,887
- Really?
- At this place?

2435
01:28:38,888 --> 01:28:41,118
- He came a long way.
- Yes.

2436
01:28:41,288 --> 01:28:43,987
That's because it is a wonderful place.

2437
01:28:43,988 --> 01:28:45,897
- Right.
- The place has good energy.

2438
01:28:45,898 --> 01:28:49,297
They say if you make one wish here, it will definitely come true.

2439
01:28:49,298 --> 01:28:51,998
Like how Taejo Yi Seong Gye prayed for the founding of Joseon.

2440
01:28:52,068 --> 01:28:53,398
Only one wish comes true?

2441
01:28:53,668 --> 01:28:55,148
- Can I make 2 wishes?
- Just make 1.

2442
01:28:55,668 --> 01:28:57,637
(Let's get good energy, watching the sunrise at Boriam Hermitage.)

2443
01:28:57,638 --> 01:28:58,978
This is so cool.

2444
01:28:59,608 --> 01:29:02,077
(The members are waiting for the sun to rise.)

2445
01:29:02,078 --> 01:29:04,147
- This is great.
- It's pretty.

2446
01:29:04,148 --> 01:29:06,147
What's that thing in the back? Is it a cloud?

2447
01:29:06,148 --> 01:29:08,018
That thing over there? Ocean fog.

2448
01:29:08,048 --> 01:29:09,817
This is my first time seeing ocean fog.

2449
01:29:09,818 --> 01:29:11,217
Are you serious?

2450
01:29:11,218 --> 01:29:12,218
(The South Sea covered in ocean fog)

2451
01:29:12,219 --> 01:29:14,857
- They are not clouds?
- It's ocean fog.

2452
01:29:14,858 --> 01:29:16,327
It looks amazing.

2453
01:29:16,328 --> 01:29:18,627
My goodness. Look at that. It looks magnificent.

2454
01:29:18,628 --> 01:29:20,308
(DinDin captures the ocean fog on camera.)

2455
01:29:20,498 --> 01:29:23,028
(The sea is dyed red even before the sun rises.)

2456
01:29:23,398 --> 01:29:24,528
It's coming up.

2457
01:29:24,768 --> 01:29:27,368
This is really annoying.

2458
01:29:27,598 --> 01:29:28,667
It's rising.

2459
01:29:28,668 --> 01:29:31,778
(The sun, which they are waiting for, is not rising yet.)

2460
01:29:31,978 --> 01:29:34,978
(While Se Yoon plays with his flash)

2461
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:38,378
- It's here.
- I can see it.

2462
01:29:38,718 --> 01:29:39,747
(The sun is really rising this time.)

2463
01:29:39,748 --> 01:29:41,177
It's rising quickly.

2464
01:29:41,178 --> 01:29:42,417
- My goodness.
- That's true.

2465
01:29:42,418 --> 01:29:43,587
It's beautiful.

2466
01:29:43,588 --> 01:29:45,387
This is amazing.

2467
01:29:45,388 --> 01:29:47,557
(The sun is breaking through the clouds.)

2468
01:29:47,558 --> 01:29:48,787
This is insane.

2469
01:29:48,788 --> 01:29:52,057
(They watch the sunrise together in the South Sea.)

2470
01:29:52,058 --> 01:29:54,198
My goodness. It's coming up so quickly.

2471
01:29:54,258 --> 01:29:56,868
- Is it already this high?
- It's going up quickly.

2472
01:29:57,428 --> 01:29:58,937
(The sun is already halfway up in an instant.)

2473
01:29:58,938 --> 01:30:01,438
It's rising so quickly. Isn't too fast?

2474
01:30:03,108 --> 01:30:04,968
- I can't capture it.
- You can't.

2475
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:07,107
I can't capture the beauty.

2476
01:30:07,108 --> 01:30:08,548
You can't capture it on camera.

2477
01:30:08,908 --> 01:30:10,648
It can't be captured on screen.

2478
01:30:11,848 --> 01:30:18,348
(They capture this moment with their eyes and heart instead.)

2479
01:30:18,658 --> 01:30:19,887
This is beautiful.

2480
01:30:19,888 --> 01:30:21,688
(Impressed)

2481
01:30:23,858 --> 01:30:25,198
This place is so cool.

2482
01:30:26,058 --> 01:30:28,898
(Soon, the sun rises completely.)

2483
01:30:29,028 --> 01:30:31,127
It looks like a burning tangerine, right?

2484
01:30:31,128 --> 01:30:33,768
I know. It's truly dazzling.

2485
01:30:34,268 --> 01:30:35,767
This is legendary bright.

2486
01:30:35,768 --> 01:30:37,038
It's really bright.

2487
01:30:37,338 --> 01:30:39,037
- It's so bright.
- It really is.

2488
01:30:39,038 --> 01:30:41,078
- The sun is...
- It's unbelievably bright.

2489
01:30:41,278 --> 01:30:43,777
I see an aura-like thing around it.

2490
01:30:43,778 --> 01:30:46,618
(The overwhelmingly strong presence of the sun)

2491
01:30:46,948 --> 01:30:48,747
This is the brightest sun I've ever seen.

2492
01:30:48,748 --> 01:30:50,687
- Why is it so bright?
- I know.

2493
01:30:50,688 --> 01:30:53,117
The sun has incredibly positive energy.

2494
01:30:53,118 --> 01:30:54,357
I know. I can feel the energy.

2495
01:30:54,358 --> 01:30:56,327
I've never seen such a bright sun before.

2496
01:30:56,328 --> 01:30:58,158
The year 2026 will be bright.

2497
01:30:58,258 --> 01:30:59,927
It's so bright.

2498
01:30:59,928 --> 01:31:01,127
I think everything will go well.

2499
01:31:01,128 --> 01:31:02,998
- That's true.
- It means things will go well.

2500
01:31:03,428 --> 01:31:04,898
I should feel the energy.

2501
01:31:05,698 --> 01:31:08,038
(While they are at it, they make a New Year's wish.)

2502
01:31:09,638 --> 01:31:13,607
(The members pray with their sincere heart.)

2503
01:31:13,608 --> 01:31:16,177
I believe if I pray here, it will come true.

2504
01:31:16,178 --> 01:31:17,178
(It really feels like anything can come true.)

2505
01:31:17,179 --> 01:31:18,278
It's pretty.

2506
01:31:19,018 --> 01:31:20,348
Did you make a wish?

2507
01:31:20,848 --> 01:31:22,018
- Yes.
- I did.

2508
01:31:22,648 --> 01:31:24,147
But your wish won't come true if you say it out loud.

2509
01:31:24,148 --> 01:31:25,458
Joon, you go first and tell us.

2510
01:31:25,558 --> 01:31:26,817
- Really?
- Yes.

2511
01:31:26,818 --> 01:31:28,658
(If that's the case...)

2512
01:31:28,788 --> 01:31:30,127
What wish did you make?

2513
01:31:30,128 --> 01:31:31,557
It's a secret.

2514
01:31:31,558 --> 01:31:32,857
You can't do that. This is a TV show.

2515
01:31:32,858 --> 01:31:34,618
Then you should've kept this shoot a secret.

2516
01:31:34,758 --> 01:31:36,267
- You have a point.
- Yes.

2517
01:31:36,268 --> 01:31:37,908
- He has a point.
- It can't be a secret.

2518
01:31:38,068 --> 01:31:39,598
Tell us about your wish.

2519
01:31:40,168 --> 01:31:42,638
I wished for a sudden fortune.

2520
01:31:42,768 --> 01:31:43,808
Try again.

2521
01:31:44,108 --> 01:31:45,378
What was your wish?

2522
01:31:45,908 --> 01:31:47,277
I wished for good health.

2523
01:31:47,278 --> 01:31:48,848
- Good.
- All right.

2524
01:31:49,178 --> 01:31:51,548
(He quickly changed it to a model answer.)

2525
01:31:51,848 --> 01:31:52,848
- Jong Min.
- Me?

2526
01:31:52,849 --> 01:31:54,677
As our representative, why don't you wish our viewers...

2527
01:31:54,678 --> 01:31:56,317
a good end of 2025...

2528
01:31:56,318 --> 01:31:58,317
and say something nice for 2026?

2529
01:31:58,318 --> 01:32:00,818
He's been thinking only about good words since last night.

2530
01:32:01,288 --> 01:32:04,288
(Jong Min's words to the viewers)

2531
01:32:05,158 --> 01:32:08,198
Dear viewers, this phrase comes to mind...

2532
01:32:08,498 --> 01:32:10,268
about the year 2025.

2533
01:32:10,728 --> 01:32:13,738
"Let's forget everything that happened in the past."

2534
01:32:14,268 --> 01:32:16,037
Please forget...

2535
01:32:16,038 --> 01:32:18,467
all the bad memories and hardships.

2536
01:32:18,468 --> 01:32:21,307
We, 2 Days 1 Night, hope...

2537
01:32:21,308 --> 01:32:24,977
that only good things will happen in the new year of 2026.

2538
01:32:24,978 --> 01:32:27,017
- Thank you.
-Nice. Let's be happy.

2539
01:32:27,018 --> 01:32:28,788
- Please be happy.
- Thank you.

2540
01:32:29,888 --> 01:32:35,788
(The year 2025, where we've been working hard)

2541
01:32:36,258 --> 01:32:41,927
(Sometimes we laughed, )

2542
01:32:41,928 --> 01:32:46,438
(and sometimes we cried.)

2543
01:32:47,098 --> 01:32:54,008
(We filled the precious moments together.)

2544
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:56,778
Thank you for your love in 2025.

2545
01:32:57,148 --> 01:33:00,178
We will keep trying our best in 2026.

2546
01:33:00,818 --> 01:33:03,318
- Please stay healthy, everyone.
- Nice.

2547
01:33:04,248 --> 01:33:06,487
(Just how we've been until now, )

2548
01:33:06,488 --> 01:33:09,288
(we will continue to be together with you.)

2549
01:33:09,358 --> 01:33:13,298
- 2 Days 1 Night!
- 2 Days 1 Night!

2550
01:33:17,368 --> 01:33:19,268
(Next episode)

2551
01:33:19,538 --> 01:33:21,368
(To celebrate the New Year, )

2552
01:33:21,468 --> 01:33:23,668
(the production crew prepared plans for the year 2026.)

2553
01:33:23,968 --> 01:33:25,237
(Extreme wilderness on a deserted island)

2554
01:33:25,238 --> 01:33:26,307
(Outdoor in the freezing cold of winter)

2555
01:33:26,308 --> 01:33:27,948
(Winter training to fight cold with cold)

2556
01:33:27,978 --> 01:33:29,248
(Fishing on the vast ocean)

2557
01:33:29,748 --> 01:33:31,308
(A round-the-clock shoot with no sleep)

2558
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:34,247
(The members are not pleased.)

2559
01:33:34,248 --> 01:33:36,318
So, the theme of today's trip we prepared is...

2560
01:33:36,988 --> 01:33:38,748
(The 2026 New Year's Plan Manipulation Team)

2561
01:33:39,358 --> 01:33:41,988
(With more brutal...)

2562
01:33:42,488 --> 01:33:45,088
(and difficult missions, )

2563
01:33:45,428 --> 01:33:46,874
(they ask for another chance, just like always.)

2564
01:33:46,898 --> 01:33:48,828
(Merciless)

2565
01:33:49,768 --> 01:33:53,298
(They can't just stand by and do nothing.)

2566
01:33:53,838 --> 01:33:57,468
(Those who try to manipulate the New Year's plans...)

2567
01:33:57,508 --> 01:34:00,578
(and those who want to protect them confront each other.)

2568
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:02,748
(They are being watched.)

2569
01:34:03,608 --> 01:34:07,178
(Under even more intense surveillance, )

2570
01:34:07,378 --> 01:34:10,188
(will they be able to foil the production crew's plan?)

2571
01:34:10,548 --> 01:34:12,387
- I'll give you five seconds.
- Five seconds? Stay still.

2572
01:34:12,388 --> 01:34:13,558
(See you next week.)
