1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,410
- This is a lava path?
- Yes.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,880
You'll see at last...

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,010
why we're wearing these suits.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,450
- We'll leave through this hole.
- What?

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,980
Through this hole.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,220
I think I'll fit.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,490
Not Se Yoon, though.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,060
It might be a squeeze for him.

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,330
You can get through.

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,590
(The cameraman goes first.)

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,700
- Se Yoon can't do this.
- What?

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,270
- Se Yoon won't fit.
- I won't fit?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,340
You'll fit no problem.

14
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,300
Will you have captions saying,
"Here lies Se Yoon?"

15
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,770
(Moon Se Yoon, Died stuck in a cave)

16
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,870
In Bengdui Cave.

17
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,910
It's pretty wide.

18
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,980
It's wide.

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,780
- It's not wide.
- It's fine.

20
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,010
(It's wide for you.)

21
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,550
(Crawling)

22
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,060
(Even DinDin's getting squeezed.)

23
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,390
Watch your knees.

24
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,060
- Okay.
- DinDin's through.

25
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,160
To think I'd envy someone
who's 150cm tall.

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,400
Okay. I'll climb in now.

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,140
- This opening is narrow.
- It's narrow.

28
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,970
- It's narrow.
- Se Yoon won't fit.

29
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,210
I don't think Se Yoon can come.

30
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,970
Hang on. It's narrow even for me.

31
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,440
(Joon's camera)

32
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,980
- Hang on. This...
- I won't fit?

33
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,980
(Joon's camera)

34
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,080
Gosh, this space...

35
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,750
(I don't think Se Yoon can come.)

36
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,220
- Where are you?
- I feel competitive.

37
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,320
- Hang on. This...
- Everyone's saying I won't fit.

38
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,790
- Gosh, this space...
- But...

39
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,960
even I think I won't fit.

40
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,760
Should I attempt it?

41
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,860
- Everyone.
- Okay.

42
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,630
I sweated a lot,

43
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,700
so I think I currently weigh 120kg.

44
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,500
If I can get through, so can you.

45
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,970
(Groaning)

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,440
There are jewels.

47
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,670
(Exploring caves is hard work.)

48
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,710
(Look! Treasure!)

49
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,810
There are jewels.

50
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,010
I found treasure.

51
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,210
(He found the treasure
on the other side.)

52
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,450
Se Yoon, you must come over.
The treasure's here.

53
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,050
- You found the treasure?
- Yes, it's here.

54
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,050
Where?

55
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,090
The hope of the obese.
The number one obese guy.

56
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,720
I'll get through.

57
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,790
Make my bottom look small.

58
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,460
I mean it.

59
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,960
(Can he get through?)

60
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,000
This is madness.

61
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,500
It's smaller than I thought.
It was hard even for me.

62
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,540
(A bottom that wants out.)

63
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,900
- You can manage?
- With my arms.

64
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,070
- I'll pull myself through.
- I see.

65
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,640
(Se Yoon's camera)

66
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,140
- You can manage?
- With my arms.

67
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,680
Se Yoon, you need to know
that we must go back.

68
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,350
- What?
- We must get back out.

69
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,350
From here?

70
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,880
From here.

71
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,520
(He pulled himself through
with his arms.)

72
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,920
I did it. I'm through.

73
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,860
(Fat folks, I did it.)

74
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,890
That's amazing.

75
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,160
This is the smallest cave
I've been in.

76
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,690
- Hey!
- My gosh. What?

77
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,700
- The treasure.
- We found it.

78
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,660
- Wait. Don't touch it.
- Why not?

79
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,730
- I touched it.
- No!

80
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,170
- I touched it.
- Why can't we touch it?

81
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,570
We suffered to get here.

82
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,200
(Yelping)

83
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,310
- What's wrong?
- Look at this guy.

84
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,170
Give it to us.

85
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,710
- Give it to us.
- Let us see it.

86
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,940
Let's open the box.

87
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,650
The box. Just a moment.

88
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,020
I'll explain the mission.

89
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,020
- There's another mission?
- Getting here was a mission.

90
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,490
It was a mission for Se Yoon.

91
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,690
From here all the way to the exit,

92
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,890
there are
a total of three treasure boxes.

93
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,660
You can select just 1 of those 3.

94
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,030
For your information,
1 box has 0 gold coins.

95
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,940
The other 2 boxes
contain up to 20 gold coins.

96
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,640
It's a random pick.

97
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,980
You must now decide
whether or not you will take...

98
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,610
- this box with you.
- That's why we couldn't touch it.

99
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,810
It's totally random.

100
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,710
- Have you chosen?
- Not yet.

101
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,420
Which...

102
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,750
(He smacks the box.)

103
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,820
Oh, dear.

104
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,020
I say we take the next one, or...

105
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,520
- He's nasty.
- Me too.

106
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,930
When did that happen?
It was a mistake.

107
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,330
- It was. I saw it.
- Hey.

108
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,330
- Yes.
- Hey.

109
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,100
- Put it where it was.
- No.

110
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,560
- Put it back!
- You can't touch it.

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,600
- Should I?
- Yes.

112
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,870
- Don't touch it.
- Come on.

113
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,400
- Why did you do that?
- It's not right.

114
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,500
Can we put it back?

115
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,300
- We should.
- Yes, we should.

116
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,040
- Put it back.
- Can we put it back?

117
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
I say Number 2 or 3. What about you?

118
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,380
(It didn't sound like
there were 20 gold coins.)

119
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,610
I think...

120
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,050
Let's go. Move it.

121
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,350
I really... Sorry.

122
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,350
(Sorry.)

123
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,680
It was a mistake.

124
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,520
It's okay
if you apologize sincerely.

125
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
He'll forgive you.

126
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
We'll pass on Number One.

127
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,090
- It's usually Number Three.
- We'll go this way.

128
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,400
We'll walk like ducks again.

129
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,500
(The path to Number 2
is narrow too.)

130
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,170
- Watch your heads.
- Se Yoon.

131
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,670
Gosh,
this path is really narrow too.

132
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,970
My goodness. Save me.

133
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,810
(The hope of the obese
meets another obstacle.)

134
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,210
(DinDin and Joon go first.)

135
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,810
(DinDin's camera)

136
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,880
(Groaning)

137
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,050
It's easier than before.

138
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,220
- I found the box.
- It's easier than before.

139
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,360
(Contrary to what he said,
his breath is uneven.)

140
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,690
I found the jewels.

141
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,860
- The treasure.
- This was easier.

142
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,090
My legs are about to give way.

143
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,560
I envy DinDin.

144
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,300
- DinDin.
- Gosh.

145
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,100
My legs are about to give way.

146
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,370
(He pulls himself through again
to reach the treasure.)

147
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,480
Is it there?

148
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,780
- The treasure's here.
- It's there?

149
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,650
I want to touch it.

150
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,150
- My hunch tells me that...
- Yes?

151
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,820
this is the one.

152
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,750
I think the energy
of the universe...

153
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,360
- I think...
- is gathered here.

154
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,290
You read our fortunes in the car.
What did yours say?

155
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,230
Do you meet someone today or what?

156
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,370
(You meet someone special
after a long time...)

157
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,000
(Joon's fortune was auspicious.)

158
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,170
(Number 2 selected by Joon
with the good fortune?)

159
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,410
I think it's Number Three.

160
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,970
- Number Three?
- Yes.

161
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,810
For a long time,
I believed in three.

162
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,250
My name is Se Yoon.
"Se" sounds like "three."

163
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,720
And Koreans
love the numbers 1, 3, 5, 10.

164
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,350
When you gift someone money,

165
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,450
it's always 10, 30, and 50 dollars.

166
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,660
In general,
most people like the number three.

167
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,960
The majority is right.

168
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,290
- Number 3.
- We'll go with 3.

169
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,390
- Then we'll skip this one.
- Yes.

170
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,130
(The director picks up the box.)

171
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,000
- Hang on.
- Are you okay?

172
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,200
Are you okay?

173
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,900
(There's an extraordinary sound.)

174
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,840
I said I had good fortune!

175
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,070
- Director!
- It's okay.

176
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,140
- The feeling...
- We don't know.

177
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,880
There could be 20 in the other box.

178
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,810
Yes. This could have ten inside.

179
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,480
(The last box is before the exit.)

180
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,420
- There it is.
- The cave.

181
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,220
The treasure's here.

182
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,590
We got it.

183
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,490
Is this the box we chose?

184
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,530
We have to pick this one.

185
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,700
(Exclaiming)

186
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,460
Does it feel good?

187
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,530
(DinDin, you feel it.)

188
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,830
(Excited)

189
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,640
What's this? It feels good.

190
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,040
(Are there 20 gold coins inside?)

191
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,980
You can see the results
out in the open.

192
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,580
(They leave the precious time behind
to check the treasure.)

193
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,520
We're back in reality.

194
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,980
This is the real life.

195
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,160
(They exit Bengdui Cave.)

196
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,830
- Are you back safely?
- Yes.

197
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,860
Yes.

198
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,800
It was an amazing experience.

199
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,300
- Totally.
- Are you glad you came?

200
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,100
Until this lifetime ends,

201
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,040
I don't think
I'll visit a cave this incredible.

202
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,340
It was the pinnacle of nature.

203
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,880
From what I heard,
you chose the third box.

204
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,510
(3 treasure boxes
with 0 to 20 gold coins)

205
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,820
(Among them, they picked
Treasure Box Number 3.)

206
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,650
(How many gold coins
will there be in this box?)

207
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,490
Please open it.

208
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,690
What if there are stones
or a frog inside?

209
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,460
(Is it 0 or 20?)

210
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,030
- There are 5.
- There are 5.

211
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,470
Then you obtained 5 gold coins.

212
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,940
We brought the boxes
that you didn't pick.

213
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,940
- Is that Number 1?
- Just 1 box...

214
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,070
It had a stone inside.

215
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,340
- We made a good choice.
- This is Number One.

216
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,780
- Right.
- We knocked it over by mistake.

217
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,880
In that case...

218
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,580
I told you that I had good fortune.

219
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,610
Goodness.

220
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,480
You obtained five gold coins.

221
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,820
Why did you give up
in the middle of it?

222
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,050
You should have insisted
until the end.

223
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,990
We should follow
the majority decision.

224
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,390
- No, this is your fault.
- You should follow your instinct.

225
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,430
- Is this my fault?
- Goodness.

226
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,660
- This is your fault.
- How so?

227
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,260
You should've been more stubborn.

228
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,530
(And...)

229
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,130
Based on its appearance,
it looks venomous.

230
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,800
- My foot fell in the mud.
- Get away, everyone.

231
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,130
I don't like how it looks.

232
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,170
It doesn't look good at all.
Get out of there.

233
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,670
I used to dream
of becoming a veterinarian.

234
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,380
Hey, isn't this a viper?

235
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,310
- It's a venomous snake.
- It's a venomous snake.

236
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,380
I know.

237
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,850
(It doesn't look like he's lucky.)

238
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,820
Goodbye. Take care.

239
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,450
- Was it eating a centipede?
- It was eating a centipede.

240
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,050
It's not that hot today.

241
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,460
It's because we came outside
not so long ago.

242
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,690
Is that so?

243
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,760
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

244
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,160
We're departing now.

245
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,530
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

246
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,500
This was my first time...

247
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,830
(Exclaiming)

248
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,130
seeing a cave like that.
It was a magnificent view.

249
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,940
- It was quite mysterious.
- Yes.

250
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,540
It made me realize
that I should cherish each day.

251
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,540
- Of course.
- What?

252
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,870
We don't know
what will happen tomorrow.

253
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,280
In 10,000 years...

254
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,840
- We can't even live 100 years.
- We should enjoy ourselves.

255
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,910
I will cherish today with you guys.

256
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,920
Okay, so you should
sleep outdoors tonight.

257
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,520
I don't cherish that.

258
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,980
(Firm)

259
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,950
Didn't we win more gold coins
than we expected?

260
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,050
- Right.
- Right?

261
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,920
- You're right.
- The other team should win...

262
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,930
- at least ten coins.
- In my opinion...

263
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,190
If we clear 3 missions,
we could win 60 coins.

264
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,500
- Yes, 60 coins.
- It's doable.

265
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,230
In my opinion,

266
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,100
the other team probably won
3 or 4 coins.

267
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,370
We should've picked Number Two.

268
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,070
It was better
than picking the stone.

269
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,670
The cave was nice.
I've loved caves...

270
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,480
- ever since I was a child.
- Really?

271
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,080
If my dad had brought me to a cave,
I would have loved it.

272
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,880
Can you sleep inside a cave?

273
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
I can.

274
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
It's quite nearby.

275
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,120
(Glancing)

276
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,760
(Looking around)

277
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,860
Right.

278
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,220
Do you hear us in the back?

279
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,630
The GPS says that
this is our destination.

280
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,830
This is our destination?

281
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,070
(What's going on?)

282
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,600
- What's that?
- What is it?

283
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,070
What's the matter? Are we here?

284
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,240
Is this our destination?

285
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,370
What's going on? Where are we?

286
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,340
What's this place?
There's only grass.

287
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,380
(The current location)

288
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,210
This is a journey
off the beaten path.

289
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,650
- Shall we go, everyone?
- Shall we go?

290
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,050
Is this a path?

291
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,990
Where are we going?

292
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,590
Are we going somewhere to eat?

293
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,520
What's this place?
Is this another cave?

294
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,930
It's another cave.

295
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,130
(Their third exploration takes place
deep in the forest.)

296
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,400
What's this place?

297
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,570
(The path is hidden
between the thick forest.)

298
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,770
- This is really amazing.
- It's incredible.

299
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,370
Gosh, what's this?

300
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,400
It looks like a jungle.

301
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,040
(A winding, maze-like space)

302
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,780
How come their clothes are clean?

303
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,320
How did you get so dirty?

304
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,080
I heard that you were inside
a small cave.

305
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,250
Se Yoon almost got...

306
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,290
- My feet.
- stuck in the cave.

307
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,450
- Seriously?
- Yes.

308
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,820
That would've been funny.

309
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,690
My friend,
you could've been a group of five.

310
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,160
Really?

311
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,830
- I could've been stuck.
- If he had gotten stuck,

312
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,530
no one could have rescued him.

313
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,800
They would have to break the cave,

314
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,670
but they wouldn't break something
that's 10,000 years old.

315
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,840
Doesn't this remind you
of "Indiana Jones?"

316
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,370
It's an exploration.

317
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:17,180
(The actual sound at this place)

318
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,050
Do you hear the birds?

319
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,920
Is someone playing the sound?

320
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,890
Are they really birds? What a sound.

321
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,360
- Be careful going down here.
- It's dark.

322
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,990
There are no lights.

323
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,360
Someone is over there.

324
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,230
- Who?
- It's Indiana Sang Su.

325
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,230
It's our instructor.

326
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,030
- Hello.
- Welcome.

327
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,530
(Exclaiming)

328
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,440
- What is it?
- What is it?

329
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,000
- What's the matter?
- What is it?

330
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,540
(Impressed)

331
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,610
- What is it?
- What is it?

332
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,870
- Is this the place?
- Oh, my.

333
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,480
(Exclaiming)

334
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,040
- What's this?
- What's this?

335
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,750
(What they find in front of them)

336
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,380
(When you follow the steep path,)

337
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,220
(a breathtaking view unfolds
before you.)

338
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,130
(A wonder of nature
shaped over eons)

339
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,590
I didn't know
such a place existed on Jeju Island.

340
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,300
Look at this tree.

341
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,330
It looks like a movie set.

342
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,900
(A majestic scene
made by the breath of lava)

343
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,370
What is this place?

344
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,710
This is Lave Bridge.

345
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,780
- That's amazing.
- Is this a bridge?

346
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,150
Yes, it's shaped like a bridge.

347
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,150
How is it maintained like this?

348
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,680
On top of it, there was a lava cave.

349
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,080
- On top of it?
- You saw...

350
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,620
- the caves a moment ago.
- Yes.

351
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,620
Lava that erupted from
Geomunoreum Lava Tube...

352
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,820
flowed 14km,
all the way to the coastline.

353
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,630
- Fourteen kilometers?
- It formed eight lava tubes...

354
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,700
that have been designated
as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

355
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,170
This is 1 of the 8 lava tubes.

356
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,830
A cave was formed.

357
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,140
Then the surface
of the cave collapsed.

358
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,340
As it's shaped like a bridge,

359
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,180
- this is called Lava Bridge.
- "Lava Bridge."

360
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,540
We can see the tree roots.

361
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,210
It's two stories.

362
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,910
There's one bridge inside.

363
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,880
- It's fascinating.
- There's another one here.

364
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,050
You can see traces of flowing lava.

365
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,590
Exactly.
These are tracks of lava flow.

366
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,720
Yes, these are the traces.

367
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,690
It looks like "Jumanji."

368
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,220
It became a world on its own.

369
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,730
It really looks like a movie set.

370
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,190
I can't believe such a place existed
on Jeju Island.

371
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,730
Gosh, look at this tree.

372
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,700
- Take a look at the wall.
- The trees are...

373
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,630
Do you see the trees stuck
on the rock?

374
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,030
- Yes.
- They're stuck on the wall.

375
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,970
People in Jeju say,
“Trees rely on rocks."

376
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,340
"Rocks rely on trees.”

377
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,570
- Pardon?
- What?

378
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,540
- What's "nang?"
- “Nang” means trees...

379
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,540
in Jeju dialect.

380
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,150
Trees rely on rocks to live.

381
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,450
- They rely on them?
- Yes.

382
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,180
- And the rocks?
- Rocks endure by relying...

383
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,550
on trees.

384
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,620
That's why they didn't collapse.

385
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,950
Trees in this region...

386
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,460
represent the difficult lives...

387
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,290
- Do they represent them?
- of the people in Jeju.

388
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,260
Despite the barren land,
Jeju people have relied on each other...

389
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,460
like the trees and the rocks.

390
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,230
- We should rely on each other.
- The traces still remain.

391
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,530
Yes, that's important.

392
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,870
(We can estimate the period of reliance
based on the tree size.)

393
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,710
- This reminds me...
- Yes?

394
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,110
- of Se Yoon.
- How so?

395
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,780
His family relies on Se Yoon.

396
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,010
Se Yoon relies on his family.
Don't you think so?

397
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,150
(Moved)

398
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,180
You're right.

399
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,150
- The tree reminds me of Se Yoon.
- On 2 Days and 1 Night,

400
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,550
this tree represents
the big brother.

401
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,920
- Right.
- Yes.

402
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,290
Everyone is hanging onto you.

403
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,690
No, it's me who's hanging onto you.

404
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,060
But it looks precarious.

405
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,090
It looks like Jong Min,

406
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,260
- but it looks precarious.
- Precarious?

407
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,600
- We might fall off soon.
- It looks precarious.

408
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,030
- It looks precarious.
- He might fall off,

409
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,430
but he's still hanging on.

410
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,070
- Of course.
- It's like a four-character idiom.

411
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,500
- Rocks rely on trees.
- Rocks rely on trees.

412
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,270
- Trees rely on rocks.
- Trees rely on rocks.

413
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,210
- That's great.
- It will stay in my memory.

414
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,510
This is managed by...

415
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,380
Jeju World Natural Heritage Center.

416
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,310
As it's open to the public
during the World Heritage Festival,

417
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,680
this place became...

418
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,950
- a popular spot for photos.
- Right.

419
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,950
- A popular spot?
- Yes.

420
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,750
- May I take some photos?
- Sure.

421
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,150
You saw the lava tubes today.

422
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,120
To promote
World Natural Heritage Sites in Jeju,

423
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,660
please work hard.
That's it for today.

424
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,660
Thank you.

425
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,660
(Indiana Sang Su's
energetic goodbye)

426
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,130
- That was charismatic. He's cool.
- He's amazing.

427
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,070
- He hasn't done it in a while.
- I see.

428
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,840
Let's take photos
while posing like explorers.

429
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,070
- Okay.
- Let's pose.

430
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,610
(Shall we pose?)

431
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,640
That looks nice.

432
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,540
Like we're going forward
to search for treasures.

433
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,880
(They look very much
like explorers.)

434
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,050
(Charismatic)

435
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,780
In 1, 2, 3.

436
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,590
Tamra Treasure Island.

437
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,320
In the middle
of the volcanic island of Jeju.

438
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,320
We shout at Lava Bridge.

439
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,530
A real adventure variety show.

440
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,890
Who are we?

441
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,160
2 Nights...

442
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,860
- 1 Day.
- 1 Day.

443
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,270
I don't think
I can come back here ever.

444
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,070
- I can't come back here.
- Of course not.

445
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,310
That was really incredible.

446
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,440
- Where are we going now?
- Are we going to eat?

447
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,480
We're now going to a restaurant.

448
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,580
- Okay.
- That's great.

449
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,940
Let's eat.

450
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,410
Recently, I appeared
in Se Yoon's music video.

451
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,180
- Are you releasing another album?
- Yes.

452
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,280
(So?)

453
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,590
For the album that I recorded
with HANHAE,

454
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,360
- Yoo Seon Ho plays the lead...
- Really?

455
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,060
- in the music video.
- It's me.

456
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,260
He made an appearance.

457
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,400
(Seon Ho playing the lead
who's full of fresh beauty)

458
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,930
(Se Yoon, the supporting actor
who's the scene-stealer)

459
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,440
(Se Yoon,
the sorrowful ballad singer)

460
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,870
(Seon Ho)

461
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,610
- It turned out very well.
- That's great.

462
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,910
- I had boxed meals with Se Yoon...
- Yes.

463
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,350
and HANHAE.

464
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,720
The 3 of us finished 6 boxed meals.

465
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,920
- Really?
- Yes.

466
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,290
So three other people were starving.

467
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,820
(So three other people
were starving.)

468
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,160
We should go to a cafe
since we're in Jeju.

469
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,290
- By 100 runs a cafe here.
- Right.

470
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,260
Can we sleep outdoors tonight
at By 100's cafe?

471
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,430
- Let's go and sleep there.
- Let's go there.

472
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,770
We were talking about celebrities
living on Jeju Island.

473
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,470
- There's Choi Hong Man.
- Right.

474
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,770
Ryu Seung Soo also lives here.

475
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,800
(Residents of Jeju Island)

476
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,110
You didn't know
that Yu Ri lived here, did you?

477
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,810
- Which Yu Ri?
- Yu Ri of Girls' Generation.

478
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,980
Does she live here?

479
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,180
How do you know that?

480
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,750
- I just know.
- How?

481
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,910
- You aren't close.
- You aren't close to her at all.

482
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,980
I'm not.

483
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,680
- He must've heard it on TV.
- Exactly.

484
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,980
(Bingo.)

485
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,390
Won't you tell us...

486
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,350
how many gold coins we won?

487
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,490
Let's do this.

488
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,220
Thumbs-up if you have ten or more.

489
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,990
Thumbs-down
if you have fewer than ten.

490
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,730
- You tell us 1st.
- Us? In 1, 2, 3.

491
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,760
- Thumbs-up.
- Thumbs-up? Goodness.

492
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,560
- Us? In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

493
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
- Thumbs-down.
- Thumbs-down.

494
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,970
Our prediction was correct,
wasn't it?

495
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,970
How many did you win?
We won 12.

496
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,500
- Twelve.
- I see.

497
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,940
You still did a good job.

498
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,570
- Please tell us.
- Like what?

499
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,270
What we will be doing next.

500
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,380
- From now on?
- Yes.

501
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,640
Here's what I expect
on 2 Days and 1 Night.

502
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,650
It's Joon.

503
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,520
We came to Jeju Island
after a long time.

504
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,550
Joon analyzes the show...

505
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,120
- and writes scripts at home.
- Let's hear from Joon.

506
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,750
They prepared something unusual.

507
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,750
- What could it be?
- Is that your conclusion?

508
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,390
What's an example
of something unusual?

509
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,990
Why are you so unusual every week?

510
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,390
(Feeling guilty)

511
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,590
- He's not normal either.
- Here's what I think.

512
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,730
There are so many things to do
on Jeju Island.

513
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,300
There's the sea.
There are mountains,

514
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,670
including Mount Halla.

515
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,470
They could make us do everything.

516
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,000
Are you saying that
you want to suffer or not?

517
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,210
I don't want to suffer today.

518
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,140
- All of a sudden?
- What's gotten into you?

519
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,380
Usually, I'm up for suffering,

520
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,010
but now that we're in Jeju,
I'd like to travel.

521
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,910
- There are horses.
- Where?

522
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,380
Wouldn't it be so much fun
to ride a horse?

523
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,480
Are you good at riding horses?

524
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,190
- You think he'd be good at it?
- I can't ride a horse.

525
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,250
He just talks too much.

526
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,620
(Laughing)

527
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,960
I've ridden a horse
while wearing a horse mask.

528
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,890
The horse got startled. Seriously.

529
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,160
Horses get angry
when they're carrying someone heavy.

530
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,230
- Really?
- Yes, really.

531
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,100
- It's time to eat.
- Let's eat.

532
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,770
- Okay.
- I'm hungry.

533
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,970
- Now...
- Let's eat.

534
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,570
Today, the trip is okay overall.

535
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,840
- It's nice.
- You explored the caves.

536
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,080
Yes, the exploration went well.

537
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,340
You may order lunch
with the gold coins...

538
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,550
that you won.

539
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,380
- I'll spend them all.
- Here's the menu.

540
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,520
I'll use them all here.

541
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,090
- Here you go.
- We have 17 gold coins.

542
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,390
(Will they be able to buy
something with 17 gold coins?)

543
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,550
We have 17.

544
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,360
(They take a look at the menu.)

545
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,690
What, 300 coins?

546
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,630
- Oh, come on.
- What?

547
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,260
(Among normal prices...)

548
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,560
(5 for a Korean set menu,
1 for bowl of rice, etc.)

549
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,260
(300 for braised hairtail,
300 for grilled hairtail)

550
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,000
(The main dishes are
very expensive.)

551
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,670
Grilled hairtail costs 300 coins?

552
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,670
Braised or grilled hairtail costs
300 each.

553
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,900
They're basically telling us
not to eat it.

554
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,340
Even if we order a Korean set meal,
the total is 30 coins for 6 people.

555
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,440
It's impossible to eat.

556
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,940
You're right.

557
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,250
There must be a way.

558
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,410
Isn't it better to leave
some treasures?

559
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,150
- Since we don't have many...
- We don't have much.

560
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,280
- All right.
- Okay, let's just eat.

561
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,620
- Let's just spend them all.
- That sounds good.

562
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,590
We should have
our first meal at least.

563
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,620
Two Korean set menu,
four bowls of rice,

564
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,690
and one additional side dish.

565
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,190
Order five bowls of rice.
Let's spend them all.

566
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,330
- Yes.
- He and I'll eat half a bowl more.

567
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,360
- Okay.
- Okay.

568
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,500
We'll spend all 17.

569
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,930
- Let's do that.
- Yes.

570
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,970
I'm so hungry.

571
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,570
- I'd love some braised hairtail.
- Kimchi...

572
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,370
(We came all the way to Jeju,)

573
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,210
(but we can't eat...)

574
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,450
(braised hairtail
or grilled hairtail.)

575
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,550
- Jeju hairtail is also called...
- I want some noodles.

576
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,250
"silver treasure on Jeju Island."

577
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,360
If you don't get to eat it,
wouldn't you feel upset?

578
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,790
We have to eat one this big.

579
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,230
We came all the way to Jeju.

580
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,530
I always had hairtail
on Jeju Island.

581
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,630
I'd be upset.

582
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,530
From summer to autumn,
they get quite plump...

583
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,930
- because they're in season.
- Exactly.

584
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,970
- They're more savory and tasty.
- They're savory.

585
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,400
They're also more oily.

586
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,140
While the food is getting ready,

587
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,140
we will give you a quiz.

588
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,340
- Okay.
- Okay.

589
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,410
The three who answer the most.

590
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,450
Really?

591
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,710
They'll get grilled hairtail...

592
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,120
- Both of them?
- and braised hairtail.

593
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
Three people only?

594
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,180
- Three people?
- Yes.

595
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,890
The game you will play is...

596
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,090
(The game to determine the lucky 3)

597
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,260
(Where you can explore
animals and nature)

598
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,530
Quiz Expedition Hairtail World.

599
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,130
I see.

600
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,630
(Quiz Expedition)

601
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,230
(Automatically playing
the nostalgic opening theme)

602
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,970
After listening to the question,

603
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,540
please write down your own answer.

604
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,870
- Jong Min, don't cheat.
- I won't.

605
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,610
Here's the question.

606
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,180
Everyone,
this is your first question.

607
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,950
- I have to eat some hairtail.
- All right.

608
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,050
Your first question.

609
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,450
Yellowtail clownfish live...

610
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,390
in a strict matriarchal society.

611
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,490
When the head female dies,

612
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,430
to preserve the species,

613
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,760
the male does this.

614
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,760
What does the male do?

615
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,730
(What does the male do
when the female dies?)

616
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,500
- I know the answer.
- What?

617
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,640
- Really?
- Yes.

618
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,070
When the head female dies,

619
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,310
- to preserve the species,
- Seriously...

620
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,970
the male does this.

621
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,180
You don't know the answer to this?

622
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,310
- This is...
- What does the male do?

623
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,880
This is just common sense.
Everyone should know this.

624
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,980
For him, when he knows the answer,
it's an easy question.

625
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,950
When he doesn't know,
it's a very hard question.

626
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,420
Something that the male does?

627
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,050
What does it do?

628
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,260
Five. Just write anything down.

629
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,790
Four, three, two, one.

630
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,960
- Time's up.
- Show us the answer.

631
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,830
In 1, 2, 3.

632
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,830
(What did everyone write?)

633
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,670
- Sex change.
- I wrote that too.

634
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,670
- That's my answer too.
- Mine too.

635
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,870
- I also wrote sex change.
- Can we use this?

636
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,870
Sex change.

637
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,040
(Three people wrote
the same answer.)

638
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,270
- Can we use this?
- Can we use this?

639
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,580
- Sex change surgery.
- Surgery? No way.

640
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,810
Isn't surgery possible?

641
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,610
Sex change surgery?

642
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,980
For a fish?

643
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,950
- It's not surgery.
- For a fish?

644
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,150
- The fish chromosomes change.
- When they change,

645
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,350
they get fertilized.

646
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,090
The male gets fertilized
into a female.

647
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,460
It's not fertilized.

648
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,490
The sex change.

649
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,730
- Joon wrote "ingestion."
- "Ingestion?"

650
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,760
- "Ingestion?"
- Ingest what?

651
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,800
What's that?

652
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,530
- For the first question.
- Fertilization.

653
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,330
(What's the answer
to the first question?)

654
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,240
(When the head female
yellowtail clownfish dies,)

655
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,110
(the male next in line
changes sex...)

656
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,370
(and leads the group.)

657
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,780
(Answer: Sex change)

658
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,480
- Yes!
- Really?

659
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,510
- Is the answer sex change?
- I got it.

660
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,780
How is it possible?
Do they get surgery?

661
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,850
Sex change.

662
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,550
- That's ridiculous.
- Sex change is correct.

663
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,550
(Shocked)

664
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,920
I had given up, but I got it right.

665
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,160
Oh, my.

666
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,960
- Mine was close.
- Okay.

667
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,760
- Here's your second question.
- Yes.

668
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,830
- This is fascinating.
- All right, everyone.

669
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,300
Primates such as humans,
monkeys, and gorillas...

670
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,200
have fingerprints.

671
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,670
(What primates have in common:
Fingerprints)

672
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,440
What is the only
non-primate animal...

673
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,310
that has developed fingerprints
to help consume leaves,

674
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,250
its main diet?

675
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,890
(Which animal could it be?)

676
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,990
- I know the answer.
- How do you know?

677
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,130
I don't think the fingerprints
are on the hands.

678
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,960
- It's not a primate?
- I get it.

679
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,160
Does it live in the sea?

680
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,360
Jong Min, as I told you,

681
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,700
its main diet is leaves.

682
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,530
- Leaves?
- Yes.

683
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,600
You're out of time.

684
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,900
- It feeds on leaves?
- Five.

685
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,940
Okay.

686
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,570
Let's do it.
I feel like this is the answer.

687
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,680
Let's go. It can't be helped
if you don't know.

688
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,410
- I have absolutely no idea.
- Three,

689
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,950
two,

690
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,580
- one.
- Write it down.

691
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,720
Show us your answer.

692
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,050
- It's confusing.
- In 1, 2, 3.

693
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,920
As far as I know, oxen have
fingerprints on their tongue.

694
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,020
Isn't the answer zebra?

695
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,560
Zebras have fingerprints
on their skin.

696
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,260
- Which animal?
- On their stripes...

697
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,890
I wrote koala.

698
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,630
I have no idea.

699
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,530
- I guessed carelessly.
- Fingerprints on their skin.

700
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,630
(Butterfly)

701
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,400
(Its main diet is leaves.)

702
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,570
- "Pelicana?"
- Is this correct?

703
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,300
- Is it a type of snake?
- You mean the fried chicken brand?

704
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,540
Does anyone have the right answer?

705
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,840
- One of your answers is correct.
- Which one?

706
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,310
- All of us have different answers.
- Right.

707
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,080
(Only one of them is correct.)

708
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,210
Is the answer one syllable?

709
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,310
(Who is correct?)

710
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,080
- What?
- Sae Ho's koala is correct.

711
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
(Answer: Koala)

712
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,220
(Cho Sae Ho is correct.)

713
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,620
- Really?
- Yes.

714
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,620
Really?

715
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,850
(Isn't the answer ox?)

716
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,890
- Really?
- How did you know?

717
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,760
He said that it feeds on leaves.

718
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,530
I didn't even know
that koalas ate leaves.

719
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,860
- Is koala the answer?
- In order to pick...

720
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,130
leaves that are less toxic,

721
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,970
koalas must have paws
that are very sensitive.

722
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,200
That's why their paws
have developed fingerprints.

723
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,540
(Koala, Human)

724
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,570
(Their fingerprints are
very similar to humans'.)

725
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,640
Koala is difficult to guess.

726
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,580
That's unbelievable.

727
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,080
Here's your next question.

728
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,380
According to recent research,

729
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,820
the cuttlefish, known as...

730
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,820
a highly intelligent
marine animal, is found...

731
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,160
to use its arms to communicate...

732
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,660
- in a form of sign language.
- What?

733
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,060
Herrings have
an exceptional sense of hearing.

734
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,500
How do they communicate?

735
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,200
(How do herrings communicate?)

736
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,200
My goodness.

737
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,300
Herrings have
an exceptional sense of hearing.

738
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
- How do they communicate?
- Do they really communicate?

739
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,970
- Are you sure they communicate?
- Yes.

740
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,880
- Would you like a hint?
- Yes.

741
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,980
- No.
- Don't.

742
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,080
We need a hint.

743
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,950
(Their opinions differ.)

744
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,680
Raise your hand if you want a hint.
I do.

745
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,120
- Okay.
- Give us a hint.

746
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,380
- It's 4 against 2.
- Really?

747
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,620
The hint is...

748
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,590
- Moon Se Yoon.
- Moon Se Yoon?

749
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,620
(Hint: Moon Se Yoon)

750
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,790
Moon Se Yoon?

751
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,260
(I'm the hint?)

752
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,060
With fat?

753
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,530
(Do they communicate
with their fat?)

754
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,330
- Goodness.
- Three, two,

755
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,470
(What do herring and Se Yoon
have in common?)

756
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,500
one.

757
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,600
Could this be it?

758
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,770
- Did you all write it down?
- Yes.

759
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,770
Show us the answer. In 1, 2, 3.

760
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,940
- This is it.
- Mooing.

761
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,010
Farting.

762
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,040
- By farting.
- By mooing.

763
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,980
Herrings wouldn't make this sound.

764
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,780
I bet herrings fart underwater.

765
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,390
It's either farting, or...

766
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,920
- Se Yoon's snoring?
- snoring.

767
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,190
- Do they snore?
- Farting or snoring.

768
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,660
By rubbing their bodies.

769
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
(Ultrasound?)

770
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,590
- No one's answer is convincing.
- Did anyone guess it?

771
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,300
Sae Ho is correct.

772
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,030
- What was your answer?
- Farting.

773
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,630
Farting.

774
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,630
Do herrings fart?

775
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,700
When a predator approaches,
herrings release air bubbles...

776
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,070
from the anus that produce
unique sounds to alert...

777
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,640
other herrings of danger.

778
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,110
(They release air bubbles
to alert other herrings of danger.)

779
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,680
That's incredible.

780
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,210
I keep guessing correctly.

781
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,820
- Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho got it.

782
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,450
Sae Ho is in the lead.

783
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,590
- That's incredible.
- Farting?

784
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,390
They gave my name
as a hint for farting.

785
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,790
- Everyone.
- The answer was farting.

786
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,960
Next is an O-X quiz.

787
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
Okay.

788
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,990
(50 percent chance of winning)

789
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,030
Here's the question.

790
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,230
When lightning strikes the sea,

791
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,230
(Lightning striking the sea)

792
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,300
fish can also get electrocuted.

793
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,770
(When lightning strikes the sea,
fish can also get electrocuted.)

794
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,870
(This is confusing.)

795
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,370
- This is confusing.
- When lightning strikes the sea,

796
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,340
fish can also get electrocuted.

797
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,450
I'm sure of it.
I finally know the answer.

798
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,050
(I finally know the answer.)

799
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,180
- Really?
- Yes.

800
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,250
How are you so sure?

801
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,620
I know things like this.

802
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,060
Do they get electrocuted?

803
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,090
This damages my sense of pride.

804
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,130
I can't stop looking
at Sae Ho's answer.

805
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,700
(The model student
for quizzes on animals)

806
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,770
Jong Min is looking
straight at his answer.

807
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,930
- I already wrote down my answer.
- All right.

808
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,570
In 1, 2, 3.

809
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
O.

810
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,970
You wrote O or X?

811
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,070
- I wrote X.
- I wrote X.

812
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,640
Sae Ho's answer is O.

813
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,110
(His answer is different
from Ace Sae Ho's.)

814
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,510
I don't know either.

815
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,010
All right.

816
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,710
- Electric eels live in freshwater.
- Yes.

817
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,850
When they discharge electricity,
they can kill other fish.

818
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,950
Lightning strikes...

819
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,190
- lakes a lot.
- Right.

820
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,390
Then dead fish should float
in the water,

821
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,560
but they don't.

822
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,790
With lightning striking so fiercely,

823
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,390
whales and sharks
wouldn’t stand a chance.

824
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,490
But they're deep in the water.

825
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,700
Those deep in the water are safe.

826
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,600
- Those on top...
- Fish on top would get surprised...

827
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,830
- and electrocuted.
- Exactly.

828
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,400
Fish can get electrocuted,

829
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,140
- but do some of them survive?
- So they can get electrocuted.

830
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,640
The answer is definitely O.

831
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,810
- The answer is X.
- Really?

832
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,810
The answer is X.

833
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,240
(Joy, Sorrow)

834
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,780
- How?
- That's right.

835
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,850
How so?

836
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,480
When lightning strikes the sea,

837
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,020
the electric current
stays on the surface.

838
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,580
It doesn't penetrate underwater.

839
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,720
- That's right.
- That's right.

840
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,990
My victory would've been certain
if I had gotten it right.

841
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,860
I should've gotten it right.

842
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,220
Joon didn't get any right.

843
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,460
Jong Min changed his answer
at the last minute.

844
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,460
Yes.

845
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,700
Everyone, here's the next question.

846
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:20,070
(Rattlesnake)

847
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:24,340
Rattlesnakes make louder rattling
sounds when they're bigger.

848
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,580
(Rattlesnakes make louder rattling
sounds when they're bigger?)

849
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,680
- Okay.
- The questions are...

850
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,280
- tricky.
- I agree.

851
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,250
Okay, let's hurry and write it down.

852
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,090
- Rattlesnakes.
- In 1, 2, 3.

853
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,150
- X.
- X.

854
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,250
- Gosh.
- Mine is O.

855
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,890
Who else wrote O?

856
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,120
- No one.
- What's your answer?

857
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,720
- Mine is X.
- Mine too.

858
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,790
Don't rattlesnakes make sounds
by rubbing something?

859
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,430
- They have something in their tail.
- Right.

860
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,800
That doesn't depend on its size.

861
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,170
- Right.
- It's impossible.

862
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,840
Let's say
a baby rattlesnake is born.

863
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,070
It can't make the same sound
as its mother.

864
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,210
That's impossible, but...

865
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,880
(A baby can't make this sound.)

866
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,940
Can my son make a louder sound
than me? No way.

867
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,610
I'm sure of this.

868
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,180
Good things come in small packages.

869
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,420
A smaller rattlesnake would make...

870
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,320
- a concentrated sound.
- Right.

871
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,090
Let's become the hero.

872
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,660
The answer is...

873
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,760
- The answer is O.
- What?

874
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,130
- The answer is O.
- What?

875
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,300
Is it O?

876
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,130
(Se Yoon is the only one correct.)

877
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,170
The answer is O?

878
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,300
- The answer is O.
- I was accurate.

879
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,770
Snakes shed their skin periodically.

880
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,810
- As more layers...
- Right.

881
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,040
- of old skin remain on the tail,
- Right.

882
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,240
the rattling sound becomes louder.

883
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,180
That's right.

884
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,410
(Happy)

885
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,150
That's right. Okay.

886
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,650
(Quiz Expedition Hairtail World,
Interim Check)

887
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,020
(Se Yoon 3, Sae Ho 3,)

888
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,390
(DinDin 2, Jong Min 1,)

889
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,550
(Seon Ho 1, Joon 0)

890
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,160
I still have a chance.

891
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,820
You only finished half of the quiz.

892
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,960
It's fine as long as...

893
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,460
your answer isn't
the same as Joon's.

894
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,530
Your answer should be
different from his.

895
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,770
Joon hasn't answered
any of them right.

896
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,370
Joon, how do you do that?

897
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,670
He has no common sense.

898
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,970
Let's copy the opposite
of Joon's answer.

899
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,840
All right, everyone.
This is your sixth question.

900
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,540
- It's only the sixth?
- Yes.

901
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,080
Everyone.

902
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,780
A human's gestation
is about ten months.

903
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,780
Of course.

904
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,120
A dog's gestation
is about two months.

905
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,020
A dolphin's gestation
is about 12 months.

906
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,460
A giraffe's gestation
is about 15 months.

907
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,730
In that case,

908
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,800
which mammal has...

909
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,330
the longest gestation on Earth?

910
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,200
- Mammal?
- Yes.

911
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,670
Aren't there many types of mammals?

912
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,110
There are lions, tigers,
and leopards.

913
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,310
It's a type of mammal that you know.

914
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,880
How long is this animal's gestation?

915
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,150
Please tell us that first.

916
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,410
- Its gestation is...
- Is it 20 months?

917
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,750
almost two years.

918
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,180
- What?
- Almost two years.

919
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,480
It must be bigger than a giraffe.

920
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,220
Okay, I got it.

921
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,190
Which animal is bigger
than a giraffe?

922
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,660
Is it a dinosaur?

923
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,290
(Sighing)

924
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,730
In 1, 2, 3.

925
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,930
I wrote rhinoceros.

926
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:00,960
(Rhinoceros)

927
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,900
- Elephant.
- Is that correct?

928
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,130
I wrote rhinoceros.

929
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,870
(The answer is split
into two teams.)

930
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,510
But the elephant is way too simple.

931
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,080
- The answer is...
- Please let it be elephant.

932
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,480
(What is the answer?)

933
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
Elephant.
(Answer: Elephant)

934
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,580
I almost wrote elephant.

935
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,050
Joon, be happy.
You got the first character correct.

936
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,620
I got it wrong because
it was the same as Joon's.

937
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,850
- You didn't look at his answer?
- No.

938
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,660
Joon, you're impressive.

939
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,060
(The next question)

940
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,690
(Pheasant)

941
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,200
The male pheasant
is called a rooster.

942
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Right.

943
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,770
The female pheasant is called a hen.

944
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,070
That should've been the question.

945
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,170
Then what's
the baby pheasant called?

946
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,240
- Okay.
- Okay.

947
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,280
I've heard of this.

948
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,110
Number one, kkeobeong.

949
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,180
Number two, kkabeong.

950
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,510
Number three, kkeobyung.

951
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,350
Number four, jangtoori.

952
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,790
This is difficult.

953
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,420
- We'll hold it up.
- Show us the answer.

954
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,520
In 1, 2, 3.

955
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,520
Mine is number three.

956
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,790
What's Joon's answer?

957
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,190
His answer is number four,
jangtoori.

958
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,000
(He has the same answer as Joon.)

959
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,130
- I got it wrong.
- I almost picked number four.

960
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,770
Why would you think that?
We don't know the answer yet.

961
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,000
- My answer is the same as his.
- Is there a reason?

962
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,840
Okay, number three has...

963
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,270
a chance of being correct. Let's go.

964
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,310
The answer is...

965
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,480
(What is the answer?)

966
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,580
(Will he be incorrect again?)

967
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,650
- Is it number 1?
- Number 3, kkeobyung.

968
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,550
Okay. It's kkeobyung.

969
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,120
The name of a baby pheasant...

970
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,490
turned into kkeobyung, a chick.

971
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,060
Okay, it's kkeobyung.

972
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,960
(He got it wrong again.)

973
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,860
What's the score of my teammates?

974
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,590
I got 4, and Se Yoon got 5.

975
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,900
- How about you?
- I got three.

976
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,660
Joon, will you keep trying...

977
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,430
or take a break?

978
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,170
Joon is really impressive.

979
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,200
I'll let Joon...

980
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,040
pick a quiz he wants.

981
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
- Sure.
- Okay.

982
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,140
- The O-X quiz.
- The O-X quiz?

983
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,740
- The O-X quiz?
- Let's go with Joon's choice.

984
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,380
- Joon picked...
- Can I decide...

985
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,450
my answer based on Joon's answer?

986
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,080
It should be the opposite of Joon's.

987
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,650
Joon, what's your answer?

988
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,080
If he picks X, we'll write O.

989
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,320
If Joon is okay with it.

990
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,390
- What do you think?
- That sounds good.

991
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,690
- Okay.
- Joon's answer.

992
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,720
All right.

993
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,820
(Joon's sense of pride
is on the line.)

994
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,960
Here's the question.

995
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,660
Bats are the only mammals
that can fly.

996
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,200
(Does Joon know the answer?)

997
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,030
- This is so easy.
- What's the answer?

998
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,040
- What's the answer?
- It's X.

999
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,110
Please explain why.

1000
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,840
There are so many mammals that fly.

1001
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,440
Flying squirrels also fly.

1002
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,780
We can't say that
flying squirrels fly.

1003
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,550
This is very confusing.

1004
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,950
There's no need to be confused.

1005
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,550
I'll give the rest of you
five seconds.

1006
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,350
- Joon, is your answer X?
- Mine is X.

1007
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,490
- I'll go with the opposite.
- Two.

1008
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,020
I'm sorry, Joon.

1009
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,390
- What?
- I went the opposite.

1010
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,420
But why?

1011
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,630
(What? Why?)

1012
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,060
In 1, 2, 3.

1013
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,700
- I said the opposite.
- Me too.

1014
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,030
- Me too.
- Is everyone's answer O...

1015
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,130
except Joon?

1016
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,500
(Everyone else picked O
unlike Joon.)

1017
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,540
That hurts.

1018
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,570
Let Joon get one right.

1019
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,040
We did it
so that you can get one right.

1020
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,980
- Thank you. I'd like to.
- The answer is...

1021
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,010
The answer is...

1022
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,480
(What's the answer?)

1023
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,850
- Could it be O?
- No way.

1024
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,380
Is it X?

1025
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,080
(Bats are the only mammal
that can fly.)

1026
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,080
- It's O.
- Gosh!

1027
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,150
(Answer: O)

1028
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,290
- It's O.
- Gosh!

1029
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,590
- It's O.
- Gosh!

1030
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,220
You have no common sense at all.

1031
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,260
Joon has no common sense at all.

1032
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,430
He's not even lucky.

1033
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,560
Don't I have a 50 percent chance
like the others?

1034
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,370
Flying squirrels don't count.

1035
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,800
I meant flight, not just gliding.

1036
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,840
(Bats are the only mammals
capable of true flight.)

1037
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,610
We have a very good chance
of eating.

1038
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,480
- I'll probably get to eat.
- We have five points.

1039
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,340
- But we must be wary.
- We must be wary of Jong Min.

1040
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,180
Jong Min can't catch up to us.

1041
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,780
Everyone,
you have two questions left.

1042
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,450
Shall I increase the number
of points for these two?

1043
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,320
- No.
- What are you talking about?

1044
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,550
Let it be 100 points.

1045
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,760
What are you talking about?

1046
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Let it be 100 points!

1047
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,990
I don't mind either way.

1048
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,660
This is what recreation is about.

1049
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,560
- I'd love that.
- This is 2 Days and 1 Night.

1050
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,730
Okay.

1051
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,800
I'll accept it.

1052
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,400
Why would you accept that?

1053
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,970
Just accept it.

1054
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,870
- I'll agree with the first place.
- Accept it.

1055
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,600
- This is a variety show.
- Then let's do this.

1056
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,870
- For five points.
- It's a short-answer question.

1057
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,610
The next one is
a multiple-choice question.

1058
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,080
- Okay.
- I accept it.

1059
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,210
- I also accept it.
- Me too.

1060
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,510
- I accept it.
- Okay, go.

1061
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,580
- Go.
- Okay.

1062
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,320
Joon, if you get both of them right,
you'll win four points.

1063
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,780
You still won't get to eat.

1064
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,850
Goodness.

1065
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,850
You won't get to eat any hairtail.

1066
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,120
Joon has no hope.

1067
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,520
Joon, you won't win. Just do it.

1068
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
All right.

1069
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,020
- Wait, how about this?
- Yes?

1070
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,330
Make them 2 and 3 points.

1071
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,830
Is everyone okay
with 2 and 3 points?

1072
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,360
If Joon gets the 1st one correct,
we'll make the next worth 3 points.

1073
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,900
- What do you think?
- Okay.

1074
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,300
If Joon gets the first one correct.

1075
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,370
Get the two-point question correct.

1076
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,470
- Okay.
- If he gets it right.

1077
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,500
- If not, it won't change.
- It's a short-answer question.

1078
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,670
- Okay.
- This one is worth two points.

1079
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,670
Okay.

1080
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,610
(If he gets the next one wrong,
it will be over for him.)

1081
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,010
Thanks to its exceptional
physical abilities,

1082
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,820
which insect has
the highest hunting success rate?

1083
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,790
For your reference,

1084
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,160
its hunting success rate is
97 percent.

1085
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,130
It's known as
the natural predator of mosquitoes.

1086
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,290
(An insect known as
the natural predator of mosquitoes?)

1087
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,030
An insect known as
the natural predator of mosquitoes.

1088
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,430
I know the answer.

1089
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,270
Hurry up and guess.

1090
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,570
Show your answer. In 1, 2, 3.

1091
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,540
- What is it?
- Mantis.

1092
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,510
- Isn't it dragonfly?
- Isn't it dragonfly?

1093
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,280
- Is it mantis?
- Isn't it mantis?

1094
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
Joon, what's your answer?

1095
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,080
(What they're curious about
the most is Joon's answer.)

1096
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,180
(What is Joon's answer?)

1097
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,020
His answer is mantis.

1098
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,350
(That means...)

1099
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,520
It must be dragonfly.

1100
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,820
- It must be dragonfly.
- Joon's answer is mantis.

1101
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,060
(Thank you, Joon.)

1102
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,060
The answer is dragonfly.

1103
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,390
It's a short-answer question
for two points.

1104
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,660
- The answer is...
- It must be dragonfly.

1105
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,360
- Is anyone correct?
- The answer is dragonfly.

1106
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,670
- It's dragonfly.
- Goodness.

1107
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
(Shouting with joy)

1108
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,970
(Jong Min and Seon Ho are correct.)

1109
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,910
Joon, you're really impressive.

1110
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,240
(9 losses out of 9 rounds)

1111
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,150
- I turned the tables.
- What's your score now?

1112
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,480
- It's 6 points.
- I have 6 points now.

1113
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,250
I'm doomed.

1114
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,780
We don't know who will get to eat.

1115
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,620
If you answer the next one,
you'll get to eat.

1116
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,950
- Right.
- Yes.

1117
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,890
- Except Joon,
- Who will win?

1118
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,860
no one knows the result.

1119
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,690
- It's the last question.
- It's the last multiple-choice...

1120
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,460
question for two points.

1121
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,030
Isn't it for three points?

1122
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,630
- It's worth three points.
- Only when Joon got it right.

1123
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,400
Whoever gets this one right
will get to eat.

1124
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,470
I want to play too.

1125
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,440
- Go ahead.
- Just play alone.

1126
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,140
Like you're watching
a quiz show on TV.

1127
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,140
(An automatic spectator mode)

1128
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,110
Please give us the question.

1129
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,410
All right.

1130
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,380
- Among the following animals,
- The following animals?

1131
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,650
which one runs the fastest?

1132
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,090
This one is so easy.

1133
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,360
Last time, I...

1134
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,820
It's so easy...

1135
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,230
that even kindergarteners
would know.

1136
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,130
Number one, ostrich.

1137
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,930
Number two, African elephant.

1138
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,370
(Which animal is the fastest?)

1139
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,170
Number three, cheetah.

1140
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,170
Number four, coyote.

1141
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,070
Coyote?

1142
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,870
(1. Ostrich, 2. African elephant,
3. Cheetah, 4. Coyote)

1143
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,580
The animal with
the fastest top speed.

1144
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,940
I used to dream
of becoming a veterinarian.

1145
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,780
You must distinguish between...

1146
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,520
short distance or long distance.

1147
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,220
- The fastest instantaneous speed?
- Yes.

1148
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,190
This is way too easy.
If you don't know this...

1149
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,690
It's too easy.

1150
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,160
(The talkative spectator
who got eliminated early)

1151
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,660
- What's your answer?
- My dream was to become a vet.

1152
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,190
- So which number?
- Number one.

1153
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,300
The answer is definitely ostrich.

1154
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,230
Okay, that's a relief.

1155
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,370
Number three.

1156
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,400
(He's sure of number 3, cheetah.)

1157
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,900
You're the ostrich,
and I'm the cheetah.

1158
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,070
Cheetahs get tired very quickly,
so they aren't as fast.

1159
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,810
(You're the ostrich,
and I'm the cheetah.)

1160
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,640
(Cheetahs get tired very quickly,
so they aren't as fast.)

1161
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,480
I haven't done this in a while.

1162
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,350
I'll risk my food
by taking Joon's answer.

1163
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,820
Ostrich is the answer.

1164
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,890
Ostriches are faster than cheetahs.

1165
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,890
(Certainty in his eyes)

1166
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,190
It's true that ostriches are fast.

1167
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,960
(They're waving due to
the certainty in Joon's eyes.)

1168
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,390
Gosh, could it be ostrich?

1169
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,830
- Wait a minute.
- Ostriches are really fast.

1170
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,970
- Show your answer. In 1, 2, 3.
- Ostrich? Wait.

1171
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,200
- Ostrich? Wait.
- Time up.

1172
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,840
- Wait.
- You can't write anything.

1173
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,610
- Hands off.
- But...

1174
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,270
Who wrote cheetah?

1175
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,010
- Me.
- Cheetah.

1176
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,840
- Who wrote ostrich?
- Ostrich.

1177
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,980
If the answer is ostrich,
you two will get to eat.

1178
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,250
If the answer is cheetah,

1179
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,620
- the three of you will get to eat.
- Exactly.

1180
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,620
I might get to eat.

1181
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,920
(One man who's in spectator mode)

1182
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,820
(He's deep in thought.)

1183
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,130
- Actually, cheetah is correct.
- No, because...

1184
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,500
Cheetah is correct.

1185
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,900
What are you doing?

1186
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,400
The speed of an ostrich
is about 60km per hour.

1187
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Yes, it's 50 to 60km per hour.

1188
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,270
- Cheetah is 80km per hour.
- Right.

1189
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,870
I read it somewhere.

1190
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,070
I shouldn't have listened to Joon.

1191
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,140
All right, everyone.

1192
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,210
- I just remembered the video.
- The answer is...

1193
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,510
Is the answer number one?

1194
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,320
(Ostrich...)

1195
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,050
(or cheetah?)

1196
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,750
- Number three, cheetah.
- Okay!

1197
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,750
(Answer: Number 3, cheetah)

1198
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,190
Number three, cheetah.

1199
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,960
(I'm doomed.)

1200
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,830
- What?
- What is he doing?

1201
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,390
Wasn't it your dream
to become a veterinarian?

1202
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm glad that you didn't study
to be a vet.

1203
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,560
If you did,
all the animals would be dead.

1204
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,700
Jong Min and Se Yoon both won
8 points, and DinDin won 7 points.

1205
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,910
As a result,
you'll be given the hairtail set.

1206
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,070
(DinDin, Jong Min, and Se Yoon
won the hairtail set.)

1207
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,910
Let's give a bite to Joon.

1208
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,940
He got everything wrong.

1209
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,510
I've never seen anyone score zero.

1210
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,520
(Sighing)

1211
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,320
Seon Ho and DinDin.

1212
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,190
- Please switch seats.
- Okay.

1213
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,420
Everyone, here is your food.

1214
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,820
(Feeling bitter)

1215
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,890
We can eat the side dishes.

1216
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,830
Of course.
I can eat the hairtail later.

1217
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,300
(Glaring)

1218
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,530
What was the ostrich about?
What happened?

1219
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,070
- I can't believe he got zero.
- Okay.

1220
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,270
Look at the side dishes.

1221
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,370
- My goodness.
- Here you go.

1222
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,740
The side dishes look amazing.

1223
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,270
They look very nice.

1224
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,770
This is enough to be grateful for.

1225
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,210
- It's seaweed soup with uni.
- Look at the uni.

1226
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,410
Is this for the three of us?

1227
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,950
That's right.

1228
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,480
To make it clean...

1229
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,390
Let's decide after one sip.

1230
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,390
Okay.

1231
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,150
Try it.

1232
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,990
(Piled up)

1233
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,690
Hey, take only the broth.
Only one of us might get it.

1234
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,790
Just try the broth.

1235
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,130
Gosh, it's insanely delicious.

1236
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,170
We should all eat it.
Let's share it.

1237
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,500
Let's share it.

1238
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,900
The seaweed soup is to die for.

1239
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,540
Look at the uni in the seaweed soup.

1240
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,440
The seaweed soup is excellent.

1241
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,110
(As you warm your stomach with
a bowl of seaweed soup full of uni,)

1242
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,880
It's coming.

1243
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,720
(the main dish finally appears.)

1244
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,150
It must be hairtail from Jeju.

1245
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,350
Of course. It can't be hairtail
from Senegal all of a sudden.

1246
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,920
Gosh, the hairtail is huge.

1247
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,430
(Grilled hairtail...)

1248
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,990
We have braised hairtail
and grilled hairtail.

1249
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:31,990
(and braised hairtail)

1250
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,530
(Look at that.)

1251
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,600
My goodness.

1252
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,470
Do you know how to remove the bones?

1253
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,730
Ma'am, could you help them?

1254
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,640
- Welcome.
- Yes.

1255
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,940
- You remove them with a fork.
- Yes.

1256
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,510
(The hairtail meat
comes off easily.)

1257
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,880
Ma'am, that's enough.

1258
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,220
It looks so good.

1259
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,990
My goodness.

1260
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,160
Please give it to me
so I can show them.

1261
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,460
Do you want some?

1262
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,090
Give it to me.

1263
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,130
That's for you.

1264
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,500
(They obtained another side dish.)

1265
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,170
- That should be...
- Thank you, ma'am.

1266
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,170
Thank you.

1267
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,670
We can eat now. Shall I serve you?

1268
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,340
(How does the Jeju hairtail taste?)

1269
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,540
Gosh, it's so delicious.

1270
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,070
(In awe)

1271
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,980
The hairtail tastes like
some kind of fried food.

1272
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,680
(The skin is crunchy like a fry.)

1273
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,680
This is a real tasty restaurant.
(The meat inside
is savory and moist.)

1274
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,380
- It tastes excellent.
- Look at the meat.

1275
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,620
(It's the best
when eaten on top of rice.)

1276
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,320
You aren't in Jeju
until you've tasted this hairtail.

1277
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,090
Right?

1278
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,630
(Hairtail)

1279
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,860
The seasoning is...

1280
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,600
made perfectly.

1281
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,060
(Infinite love for hairtail)

1282
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,200
(Eating)

1283
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,440
The hairtail is amazing.

1284
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
(While the winning team is
in love with grilled hairtail)

1285
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,810
Don't you have any sense of pride?

1286
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,910
(What sense of pride?)

1287
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,080
Eat while smelling this.

1288
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,280
- Joon, come closer.
- I can smell it.

1289
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,350
Seon Ho, come closer.

1290
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,420
- The smell is nice.
- It's nice to eat while smelling.

1291
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,590
- Wait a minute.
- Try it.

1292
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,060
And eat.

1293
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,560
(After smelling it,
take a huge bite of the rice.)

1294
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,960
You have to smell it now.

1295
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,300
It's really nice.

1296
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,200
Se Yoon, the hairtail is amazing.
Try some.

1297
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,600
- Se Yoon, have some.
- Okay.

1298
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,040
(Let's eat some braised hairtail.)

1299
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,140
Try the broth.

1300
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,310
(Taking a spoonful of broth first)

1301
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:26,810
The braised hairtail is amazing too.

1302
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,310
- Isn't the seasoning great?
- Yes.

1303
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,310
It tastes better
because it's braised in the broth.

1304
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,710
It's neither salty nor spicy.

1305
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,520
It's not very sweet.
It's just perfect.

1306
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,580
(The ultimate braised hairtail
with perfect seasoning)

1307
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,750
(The meat is easily separated
from the bones.)

1308
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,290
(Slurping)

1309
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,760
The radish is very well seasoned.

1310
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,600
(Radish that's seasoned
with the marinade)

1311
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,470
The radish tastes good.

1312
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,670
(Glancing)

1313
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,570
Can you give me a bite
of the radish? I'd like to try it.

1314
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,670
- I'm sorry.
- Really?

1315
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:01,140
(I'll enjoy the sweet
and spicy radish on your behalf.)

1316
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,480
(Exclaiming)

1317
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,980
(Depressed)

1318
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,090
Let's be honest.

1319
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,590
- Joon set a record.
- Right.

1320
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,760
I've never seen anyone
on 2 Days and 1 Night...

1321
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,920
get zero points on a quiz.

1322
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,590
Honestly, I've never seen anyone
like him at school either.

1323
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,360
Getting zero points
is almost impossible.

1324
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,460
(Zero Point Man, Joon)

1325
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,500
Joon.

1326
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,370
This is a present
from the three of us.

1327
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,440
(No way.)

1328
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,140
It's up to you to decide
whether to share it or not.

1329
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,740
(Braised hairtail as a medal
bestowed upon the maker of history)

1330
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,640
I've never seen
anyone get zero points...

1331
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,810
- on a variety show.
- This is very rare.

1332
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,010
Let's give this to one person.

1333
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,780
Let's just share it.

1334
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,780
We'll play a game.

1335
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,250
Which game do you want to play?

1336
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,250
(With a plate of braised hairtail
at stake)

1337
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,490
Can you give us another O-X quiz?

1338
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,760
Another O-X quiz?

1339
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,590
I just want to let Joon eat it.

1340
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,560
Even if I win, I'll give you some.

1341
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,590
It should be fair.

1342
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,730
The number of corn kernels is...

1343
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,070
equal to the number
of corn silk threads.

1344
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,140
I have to guess no matter what.

1345
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,400
- I have no idea.
- It's X.

1346
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,070
- Is your answer X?
- Yes.

1347
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,210
Then mine is O.

1348
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,580
I'll go with O
and make it clear-cut.

1349
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,610
Did you say X for a reason?

1350
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,380
- No.
- He followed his hunch.

1351
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,580
- It's based on my hunch.
- Okay.

1352
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:13,950
The answer is...
(What will be the result?)

1353
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,920
Will Joon get to eat?

1354
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,290
(Will the man with 10 wrong answers
break free from the 0 point curse?)

1355
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:19,290
(The number of corn kernels equals
the number of corn silk threads.)
It's O.

1356
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,560
It never worked out for him.

1357
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,660
(He remains as Zero Point Man.)

1358
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,100
- Let's share it.
- I said it from the beginning.

1359
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,100
Let's share.

1360
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:28,630
I suggested sharing it
from the start.

1361
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:31,030
- What's wrong with him?
- Let's share it.

1362
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,070
Have some.

1363
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:34,400
(Sae Ho and Seon Ho show mercy.)

1364
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:36,610
We worked hard together.

1365
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,040
(Heartwarming)

1366
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,640
All right, everyone.

1367
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,410
Your exploration must continue,
and so...

1368
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,610
Right, we were exploring.

1369
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,720
You will choose
the next adventure destination.

1370
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,280
- Everyone.
- Yes?

1371
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,090
Each has room for three people.
Please choose.

1372
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,090
(Life vest, Seasickness medication)

1373
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,490
It's just two boats.

1374
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,790
- I have severe motion sickness.
- Me too.

1375
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,790
I pick life vest.

1376
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,290
- I pick life vest.
- Me too.

1377
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,300
- I pick seasickness medication.
- Me too.

1378
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,200
Sae Ho, my specialty is being lucky.

1379
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,300
(Zero Point Man Joon
is full of confidence again.)

1380
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,970
Seriously.

1381
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,370
Life vest for the three of us.
Seasickness medication for them.

1382
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,210
- Okay.
- I'll pick seasickness medication.

1383
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,240
Good. Trust me. I'm always lucky.

1384
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,080
I'll trust you for the last time.

1385
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,080
- Okay.
- Really.

1386
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,450
If I turn out to be wrong
and let you down...

1387
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,050
What should I do then?

1388
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,020
- Apologize to me.
- Okay. I'll apologize on my knees.

1389
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,420
You don't have to get on your knees.

1390
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,420
(Where could be their destination?)

1391
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,620
Let's check our destination first.

1392
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,930
Wait. What?

1393
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,160
We're not going to the sea.

1394
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:32,960
What? It's a mountain.

1395
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,360
A mountain?

1396
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,470
There's a ranch and a hill...

1397
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:37,500
I think we'll ride a horse.

1398
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,670
Oh, horse riding?
Hence seasickness medication?

1399
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,840
What does it have to do
with horse riding?

1400
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,710
- A horse shakes too.
- It can cause nausea.

1401
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,570
(If that's the case...)

1402
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,940
- Are you good at it?
- We're so lucky.

1403
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,440
- What could be their mission?
- Are we?

1404
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,450
(What could be
Team Life Vest's mission?)

1405
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,050
Seon Ho, ask them.

1406
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,580
Se Yoon.

1407
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:57,620
Hey, where's your destination?

1408
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,220
- I don't know.
- Check it.

1409
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,890
(Glancing)

1410
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,790
Tell him we're going to the sea.

1411
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,830
We're going to the sea.
Where are you guys going?

1412
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,960
Us too.

1413
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,760
Let's stay safe until we meet again.

1414
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,670
- They're going to the sea?
- Yes.

1415
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,500
(Happier than ever)

1416
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,740
They're going to the sea.

1417
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,870
We chose the better one.

1418
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,840
I don't think it was a lie.

1419
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,470
- He sounded sincere.
- Right?

1420
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,140
Trusting Joon paid off.

1421
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,150
We chose the seasickness medication.

1422
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,180
(Team Seasickness Medication set off
in a good mood.)

1423
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,620
Oh, my. Look at this road.

1424
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,780
- Look at the wet fog.
- Nice.

1425
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,450
(You can enjoy a beautiful landscape
while driving on Jeju Island.)

1426
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,090
This is
what roads on Jeju Island are like.

1427
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,560
Look at the long, straight road.

1428
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,630
Make an acrostic poem
with "seasickness medication." S.

1429
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,390
Sae Ho, can you do it for us?

1430
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,430
- I'll do whatever you want.
- Okay.

1431
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:40,930
S.

1432
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,300
So what will you drink?
Hurry up and tell me.

1433
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,870
- S.
- Just drink a mixed grain drink.

1434
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,370
- M.
- With some yakgwa.

1435
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,840
That's a good one.

1436
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,300
- I can do that. But...
- That was really good.

1437
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,740
- He's really talented.
- Indeed.

1438
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,870
- I can never do as well as he does.
- You see...

1439
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,380
I'll try to make a good one.
Give me a word.

1440
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,040
Let's pick
something like "hairtail."

1441
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,050
- H.
- H.

1442
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:59,010
(Hairtail)

1443
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,050
H...

1444
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:04,490
- I can't do it.
- I told you, he's talented.

1445
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,090
You should always decide
the last phrase first.

1446
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,160
- You should decide it in advance?
- Yes. Give me any word.

1447
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,590
- Tree.
- Tree? Okay.

1448
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,360
Then I'll finish the acrostic poem
with "athlete's foot."

1449
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,100
- T.
- It's so itchy.

1450
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,400
- R.
- I think I have athlete's foot.

1451
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,600
- So you make the last phrase first.
- Yes, you should do that.

1452
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,300
I see.
You make the last phrase first.

1453
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,370
- Ocean. O.
- At the ocean...

1454
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,410
- C.
- You can see many divers.

1455
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,610
Right. You did well.

1456
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,880
- But it's not funny.
- That's right.

1457
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,510
Right. Then I'll try it.
Give me the letters.

1458
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,210
- O.
- Oh, buckets.

1459
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,620
- C.
- Are you okay?

1460
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,620
It doesn't make sense,
but it's funny.

1461
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,590
- Confidence is the key?
- Right.

1462
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:39,290
- My, he's so good at it.
- He's good at it.

1463
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:40,460
Of course.

1464
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,660
Let's make one with "Paris." P.

1465
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,860
- Shall I try it this time?
- P.

1466
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,630
What's the capital of Paris?

1467
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,060
- R.
- Isn't it Lisbon?

1468
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,070
- Yes, that's how it should be done.
- That was good.

1469
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,070
- Was it good?
- Yes.

1470
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,670
- That was funny. Yes.
- Was it good?

1471
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:54,670
(Paris is a capital. It's charming
as it's illogical and dumbfounding.)

1472
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,970
Jeju. J.

1473
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,070
- Is he...
- J.

1474
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,110
Director Joo Jong Hyun?

1475
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,310
- This one is...
- That's good. You're good at it.

1476
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,940
So are they really going to the sea?

1477
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,450
- I don't know.
- I think they are.

1478
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,850
I think he told me the truth.

1479
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,580
Are we Team Life?

1480
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,550
- I mean, Team Life Vest?
- Yes, we're Team Life Vest.

1481
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,250
Where is our destination?

1482
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:13,560
- The sea.
- The sea?

1483
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,560
Yes.

1484
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,360
Both teams are going to the sea.
That's a fact, right?

1485
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,230
We'll just get on different boats.

1486
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,830
Then why should we wear a life vest
and they take medication?

1487
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,600
But isn't the sea rough now?

1488
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,140
I don't think boats can make it out
because of the heavy rain.

1489
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,570
- We should talk to the staff.
- This isn't doable.

1490
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,970
(Chuckling)

1491
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,580
You say nothing is doable
every single week.

1492
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,940
(He refuses habitually.)

1493
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,180
You refuse everything every week.

1494
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,950
We're going to the sea
and have to wear a life vest.

1495
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,620
(Their destination still remains
a mystery.)

1496
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,820
Are we going fishing?

1497
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,290
Oh, are we?

1498
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,020
- Maybe we'll catch hairtail.
- Hairtail?

1499
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,690
- Because we ate hairtail?
- We'll exchange it for gold coins.

1500
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,090
- We have to find treasure.
- That's correct.

1501
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,130
Perhaps, we'll have to fish
and find treasure under the sea.

1502
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,160
What do you think?

1503
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,560
If so, we need to take medicine
for seasickness too.

1504
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,200
I mean, we'll have to ride a boat.

1505
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,770
(No, that's not the case.)

1506
00:49:58,770 --> 00:49:59,940
I have absolutely no idea.

1507
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,570
We chose the bad one.

1508
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:05,570
(He's sure that
they made a bad choice.)

1509
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:06,840
Look at the fog.

1510
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,780
(Driving in the fog,
the premonition grows stronger.)

1511
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,910
We chose the bad one.
I'm getting a bad feeling.

1512
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,050
I need something to connect them
to each other.

1513
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,820
What?

1514
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,390
I suddenly have a bad feeling
about this.

1515
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,150
I don't think we'll ride a horse.
Where are we?

1516
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,590
- I suddenly have a bad feeling.
- It's taking us on a weird road.

1517
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,590
Where are we?

1518
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:22,960
Something feels off.

1519
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,390
The remaining distance is 2.8km.

1520
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,260
What? Hey, we're almost there.

1521
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,100
That's our destination.
What is that thing?

1522
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,230
- What's that?
- Hold on. What is that?

1523
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,270
- What's Big Ball Land?
- What's that?

1524
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,640
- "Big Ball Land?" What's that?
- What's this?

1525
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,670
(What could be the reason
they're surprised?)

1526
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:40,040
(On the vast plain...)

1527
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,980
(There's a large ball?)

1528
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:47,550
Oh, I get it.
We're going to ride it.

1529
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,350
- We'll ride that?
- I'll get motion sickness.

1530
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:51,590
That is fun, though.

1531
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:53,020
It's easy.

1532
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,390
(Blown in the wind)

1533
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,460
(That's not all.
The wind blows strongly here.)

1534
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,930
Hello.

1535
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,330
- Hello.
- Hello.

1536
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:01,430
(What kind of adventure
will they experience here?)

1537
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,600
Oh, my. What is this place?

1538
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,100
- Did you enjoy your meal?
- Yes.

1539
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,100
You want us to get nauseous?

1540
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,300
- Right after eating lunch?
- We might vomit right away.

1541
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,840
It's one of the virtues
of an explorer...

1542
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,640
to take risks and willingly embark
on a challenging adventure.

1543
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,050
So it's time
for us to take a risk...

1544
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:19,480
- and go on a challenging adventure?
- Correct.

1545
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,750
(Now is the time
for a challenging adventure?)

1546
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:24,390
So you're going to enjoy
an extreme sport.

1547
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,060
But I really like extreme sports.

1548
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,520
- I see. I'm glad to hear that.
- Yes.

1549
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,890
The mission you have to complete here
to gain gold coins is...

1550
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,990
The Ball Is Rolling.

1551
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,400
There will be three rounds.

1552
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:39,500
Two of you will get
into a large ball.

1553
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,340
While the ball is rolling down,

1554
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,610
the remaining member
has to run fast...

1555
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:47,110
in order to get to the finish line
before the ball does.

1556
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:48,310
(The remaining member must get
to the finish line before the ball.)

1557
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,180
The first round is very simple.

1558
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,550
While running down the hill,

1559
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:56,450
you pick up as many gold coins
as you can.

1560
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,590
Hold on.
So while running down the hill...

1561
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,920
There are gold coins...
Do you see the people sitting there?

1562
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,830
There's a gold coin
in front of each of them.

1563
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,660
Then the running member picks up
the coins?

1564
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,970
Please decide who will run.

1565
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:12,000
Which of us should run?

1566
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:13,570
I can't run...

1567
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,100
- at full speed.
- Right. It shouldn't be Sae Ho.

1568
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,200
I think I should ride the ball.

1569
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,640
- I think I can run, but...
- Then you do it.

1570
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,140
- Because I ran 15km yesterday...
- Why did you go for a run?

1571
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,310
Why did you go for a run?

1572
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,310
It's fun.

1573
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,210
I mean, he came here yesterday...

1574
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,250
Then Joon,
will you run in this round?

1575
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,050
Yes, I'll run.

1576
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,150
Okay. Joon will be our first runner.

1577
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,620
- If it doesn't work, I'll run next.
- Okay.

1578
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,090
- I'll warm up for 30 minutes.
- Right.

1579
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:38,460
Who runs 15km the day before the shoot
for 2 Days and 1 Night?

1580
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:41,060
There's another one
called Lim Cheol.

1581
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,160
Gosh, seriously.

1582
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,160
(Going up the hill while telling off
the youngest member,)

1583
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:46,330
(they arrive at the destination.)

1584
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:49,040
(Struggling)

1585
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,870
Also, it's hot in here.

1586
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,070
- It's humid too, right?
- Yes. I'm scared.

1587
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,910
When I blow the whistle,
you can start running.

1588
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,010
(The runner starts
in front of the ball.)

1589
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:59,750
(They can gain gold coins
through this mission.)

1590
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:03,120
(The number of gold coins
they can gain is 4.)

1591
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,990
- If you're ready, we'll begin.
- Okay.

1592
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,890
(These two are about to experience
the extreme sport.)

1593
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,260
I'm more scared
than when I bungee jumped.

1594
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,860
- If you're ready, we'll begin.
- Okay.

1595
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,290
(Getting ready)

1596
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:15,100
Two, three!

1597
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,900
(Round 1 starts.)

1598
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,600
(Joon runs fast.)

1599
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,140
(The large ball chases after him.)

1600
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,640
- Oh, my gosh.
- Goodness.

1601
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,740
My gosh. This is scaring me.

1602
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,340
It's rolling. My gosh.

1603
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,480
(The ball rolls fast.)

1604
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:39,820
(He must run faster than the ball.)

1605
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,660
(Joon came close to a gold coin.)

1606
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,130
(He gained 1 gold coin.)

1607
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,260
(He gained 2 gold coins in a row.)

1608
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,170
I guess
we should hold out like this.

1609
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,030
(The ball is close behind Joon.)

1610
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,840
(The other members are experiencing
a new world.)

1611
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,910
What's this?

1612
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,340
(Joon already gained 4 gold coins.)

1613
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,210
(All he has to do is get to
the finish line before the ball.)

1614
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,720
(If he fails to do so,
they can't have the gold coins.)

1615
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:14,320
(They successfully completed
Round 1.)

1616
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:19,230
Do we just have to wait?

1617
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:20,900
(The ball stopped while rolling
because of the headwind.)

1618
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,830
(The ball is rolling.)

1619
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,400
- I made it.
- You made it?

1620
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,270
- Yes. I collected all of them.
- Really?

1621
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,340
(Team Big Ball has gained
4 gold coins so far.)

1622
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:32,710
- Good job.
- I collected all the gold coins.

1623
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:34,610
- Did we succeed?
- Yes.

1624
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:35,710
He collected all four coins too.

1625
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,710
(They got 4 gold coins
thanks to Joon.)

1626
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,210
As for the second round,

1627
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,950
for you,
who are hungry for gold coins,

1628
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,650
we prepared the same game
with different rules.

1629
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:43,790
That means we'll have to do well.

1630
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,320
(It's a rare chance
to gain more gold coins.)

1631
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,390
In the second round,

1632
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:51,160
you have to bet the gold coins...

1633
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,190
that you just obtained.

1634
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,860
(They have 4 gold coins now.)

1635
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:57,570
The member who runs down the hill
picks up the gold coins.

1636
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,100
You will find a four-digit
passcode on the gold coin.

1637
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,470
It will have one number
on each coin.

1638
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:03,470
(If this is what it says
on the gold coins...)

1639
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,940
Before the big ball arrives,

1640
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,210
you have to unlock the box.

1641
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,610
Then you will get
twice of what you bet.

1642
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,850
You will have to return
the gold coins...

1643
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:15,450
- if you fail to unlock.
- Okay, let's start.

1644
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,190
- All right. Four gold coins.
- That's quite tough.

1645
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,020
(Joon is getting inside
instead of Seon Ho this time.)

1646
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:22,520
I'm scared.

1647
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,490
(Seon Ho, the runner, is ready.)

1648
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,160
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1649
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,500
I'm scared...

1650
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,330
of squirrel wheels.

1651
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,570
We'll start when you're ready.

1652
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,540
(Ready)

1653
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,140
(They can get 8 gold coins
if they succeed.)

1654
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,880
- I'm scared.
- It's all right. It will flip soon.

1655
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,880
It's fun.

1656
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,120
(Round 2 has started.)

1657
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,150
(Seon Ho is running at full speed.)

1658
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,350
(Laughing)

1659
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,590
(It's fun.)

1660
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,860
(While the extreme sport
is unfolding in the ball,)

1661
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,330
(Seon Ho quickly widens the gap.)

1662
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:07,140
What is this? My goodness.

1663
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,400
(Getting 1 gold coin)

1664
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,210
(He even has the time to turn back.)

1665
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,640
(The gap is so big
that he can take his time.)

1666
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,280
(He grabbed the last gold coin
in no time.)

1667
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:29,590
(Is he done with Round 2?)

1668
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:32,030
(However, at that moment...)

1669
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:36,260
(Seon Ho's approaching slowly
as he's showing his celebration?)

1670
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,800
- Are you okay?
- My goodness.

1671
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,070
- You have to unlock this.
- What?

1672
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:41,970
- You have to unlock it.
- Really?

1673
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:45,010
(Rushing to open the lock)

1674
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:52,780
(The ball is rolling.)

1675
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,680
(Mission failed)

1676
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,220
- What is this?
- I told you to unlock it.

1677
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,220
I didn't hear it.

1678
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,460
It's better than I thought.

1679
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,660
Is Seon Ho here?

1680
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:05,190
I'm not sure.

1681
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:09,160
(They have no idea what happened.)

1682
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,200
Seon Ho, don't say anything.

1683
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,670
(Excited)

1684
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,000
(Be quiet.)

1685
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,010
Did you unlock it
before we got here?

1686
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,070
(Excited)

1687
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,810
- What happened?
- Gosh, I'm all dizzy now.

1688
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,150
- My goodness.
- So he got the coins.

1689
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:26,350
I'm all dizzy.

1690
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,750
This is the result of Round Two.

1691
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,550
(Excited)

1692
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,050
- You failed the mission.
- Really?

1693
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,290
Hold on a second.

1694
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,490
Did you know that
we had to open the lock?

1695
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,720
They told us to unlock it
with the passcode.

1696
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,360
What are you doing?

1697
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,730
I got here without rushing.

1698
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,500
Then why didn't you unlock it?

1699
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,730
I didn't know we had to unlock it.

1700
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,100
Even I understood the mission.

1701
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,270
(Seon Ho,
even I understood the mission.)

1702
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,500
- What do we do?
- So we failed?

1703
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,310
Your gold coins are all gone.

1704
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,010
I got here with so much time left.

1705
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,980
What were you doing
when you had so much time?

1706
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,350
What do we do now?

1707
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,050
- What do I do?
- So no last chance for Round Three?

1708
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,280
Let's do it one more time.

1709
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:02,550
This is just ruining the mood.

1710
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,190
This is what we'll do.

1711
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,660
All right, okay.

1712
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:08,960
- Let's do it one more time. Sorry.
- Let's go.

1713
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,090
I really had no idea.

1714
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:11,830
Are we there yet?

1715
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,390
We're almost there.

1716
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,760
What? Look at the waves.

1717
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,870
The sea looks so scary here.

1718
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,000
(Foggy gray sea welcoming them)

1719
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,070
I can't see the sea at all.

1720
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:22,300
So we're getting in the sea?

1721
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,570
I think we have to wear life vests.

1722
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,240
- What is this?
- We must wear life vests.

1723
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,710
You can all stand here.

1724
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,940
- What's this place?
- What is it?

1725
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,110
This place is called Taeutgae.

1726
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,880
- Taeutgae?
- Yes. This place is where...

1727
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,750
the seawater and spring water
co-exist.

1728
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,020
It's a swimming pool for the locals.

1729
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,490
- Right, it looks like one.
- It's Taeutgae.

1730
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,330
- Taeutgae.
- The weather here is usually good.

1731
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:46,060
And the color of the seawater
is beautiful.

1732
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,060
A lot of people come here,
it's a nice attraction.

1733
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,470
It would have been amazing
if the weather were clearer.

1734
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,740
- You chose life vests, right?
- Yes.

1735
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,870
Do you know what parasailing is?

1736
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,010
- What we do in the sky?
- Parasailing?

1737
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,570
- You're letting us do that?
- You hang on to the parachute...

1738
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:00,170
as the boat drives.

1739
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,640
Parasailing? Right.

1740
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,280
We were going to do that.

1741
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,380
- My goodness.
- But the weather isn't so...

1742
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,580
But the weather isn't so nice.

1743
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:07,880
I won't be lifted anyway.

1744
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,550
That's why we changed our activity.

1745
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,920
(Very relieved)

1746
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,120
What do we have to do now?

1747
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,590
As you're explorers
who enjoy adventures,

1748
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:17,030
you went on a cave exploration.

1749
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,730
You will go on
an underwater exploration this time.

1750
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:20,500
Let's get inside then.

1751
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,660
You should get changed first.

1752
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,970
What kind of suits are we wearing?

1753
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,400
It's not good to get in the water
right after eating.

1754
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,100
My mom told me not to do it.

1755
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,900
- "You won't be able to digest!"
- She would say stuff like that.

1756
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,270
My mother warned me.

1757
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:33,210
We have no choice but to do it.
They worked on it for two weeks.

1758
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:35,510
- What's wrong with him?
- He rushed to take medication.

1759
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,980
(Did he take any medication
to soothe his anger?)

1760
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,850
We'll meet again here
after you get changed.

1761
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:39,980
Let's get changed.

1762
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,450
- Are you all ready?
- Yes.

1763
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,390
The gold coin mission here is...

1764
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,250
Treasure Hunt Under the Sea.

1765
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,390
I'm good at this.

1766
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,260
You will find a treasure box...

1767
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,360
under the water 1 by 1.

1768
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,090
- Then you collect the gold coins.
- Right.

1769
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,630
You have five minutes.

1770
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,760
The front runner brings
the treasure box.

1771
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,330
He puts it on the table,
and then the next runner gets going.

1772
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,100
You take turns like that.

1773
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,270
All three can go together
in the last minute.

1774
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:07,780
We'll check the treasure boxes...

1775
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,980
- you find all together at the end.
- Okay.

1776
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,650
For your information, there are
many treasure boxes down there.

1777
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:15,550
The one that contains the most
number of gold coins...

1778
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:16,620
has about 20 coins.

1779
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:17,950
That's nice.

1780
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:19,490
(We have to find that one.)

1781
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,390
- Okay.
- Decide on who will go first.

1782
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:22,490
Jong Min said he would go first.

1783
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,330
Be cool and get in the water
since you got married.

1784
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,730
You have to show how you changed
after your honeymoon trip.

1785
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:27,800
It's fine even if the water's cold.

1786
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,930
But I don't like waiting for long
after I get out.

1787
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:33,530
- Then you stay in the water.
- Then stay there.

1788
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,270
- You can play under the water.
- It would be too cold.

1789
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:36,770
Do it in the order of age.

1790
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:37,840
- All right.
- We're ready then.

1791
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,540
Show us what you've got
for once and for all.

1792
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,440
You can't get in the water now.
Try wetting yourself first.

1793
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,640
Wet your bodies.

1794
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:45,210
(Checking the water temperature)

1795
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,580
It's so cold.

1796
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,850
- Is it cold?
- It's so cold.

1797
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:49,880
It is cold.

1798
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:51,920
I see something red over there.

1799
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,490
Gosh, it's so cold! Stop.

1800
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:54,720
How are you getting in the water?

1801
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,490
How is Jong Min getting in the water
when he finds it so cold?

1802
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:58,930
- Gosh, it's so cold.
- Get inside right now.

1803
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:00,360
Stop it. I'll wet my body.

1804
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,930
You will freeze
without wetting your body.

1805
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:03,230
- Gosh, it's cold.
- It's actually nice.

1806
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,270
- Are you all ready?
- Yes!

1807
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,100
- Jong Min will go first.
- Let's go.

1808
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,110
Check the farthest spot
and scan the place.

1809
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,040
I'm sure the one in
the farthest spot is the best one.

1810
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,380
Ready? Start.

1811
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,480
- My goodness.
- Get in right now.

1812
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,420
- It's so cold!
- Get in.

1813
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:22,550
We don't have to time for that.

1814
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,620
We don't have time.

1815
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:24,920
Get in the water and look!
What are you doing?

1816
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,090
Submerge yourself!

1817
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:27,890
- Get in the water.
- We're running out of time.

1818
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:28,920
(Jong Min carefully dives in
as they rush him.)

1819
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,490
(He spotted a treasure box
right below his feet.)

1820
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,960
(Lucky!)

1821
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,930
He must have found one.

1822
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:36,860
(Jong Min quickly gets back.)

1823
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,730
Don't just get out right now.

1824
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:40,940
I don't care. It's so cold.

1825
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,870
(Bragging)

1826
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,410
Put it up there. You go now.

1827
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,510
Se Yoon, go!

1828
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,380
(The 2nd runner, Se Yoon,
is on his way.)

1829
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,150
(He's a good swimmer
like a sea lion.)

1830
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:52,280
It's warmer outside.

1831
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,150
(Thoroughly searching)

1832
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:58,050
(Spotting a treasure box)

1833
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,920
That doesn't look like one.
(Quickly picking it up)

1834
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,090
(Se Yoon wakes up
in the cold water.)

1835
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,260
(Laughing)
(I told you it was cold.)

1836
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,730
DinDin can go
only when you put that on the table.

1837
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,830
Is it cold? Is it?

1838
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,470
- It's so cold.
- I see something down there.

1839
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:13,570
(The 3rd runner, DinDin,
is on his way.)

1840
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,770
(Moving forward as he dives)

1841
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,380
Gosh, it's so cold.

1842
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,840
(It's not easy to explore the sea
when the water is so cold.)

1843
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,310
You have to go deeper.
There is one treasure box there.

1844
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:25,310
(Jong Min rushes DinDin
to go deeper and farther.)
Okay.

1845
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,680
(Looking around)

1846
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:29,250
Okay.

1847
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,190
I found one.

1848
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:32,990
(Collecting the treasure box
after taking a breath)

1849
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:35,020
- Gosh, it's so cold.
- What are you doing?

1850
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,260
(Quickly getting back)

1851
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,790
Isn't this a power bank?

1852
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:38,830
(It looks oddly heavy.)

1853
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:40,030
Go straight and you will find one.

1854
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:41,060
(Jong Min gets back into the water.)

1855
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:43,760
Keep going straight.
You will see one there.

1856
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:47,740
(Jong Min spots another one
right in front.)

1857
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,170
Get out now.

1858
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,770
(Rushing)

1859
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:53,570
You will see something
on the right end.

1860
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:54,640
Swim and find one.

1861
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:55,940
We have a lot of boxes.

1862
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,250
(Se Yoon is on his way again.)

1863
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:58,250
It's on the right end.

1864
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,250
- Swim toward the right.
- Se Yoon, it's right there.

1865
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,180
- Swim toward the right.
- Se Yoon, it's right there.

1866
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,050
He's just like a water bear.

1867
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,760
(Picking up another treasure box
as soon as he gets in)

1868
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,760
(Moving to the right end
to find another treasure box)

1869
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,920
Do you see it there?

1870
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:11,830
Hurry up, Se Yoon.

1871
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,130
- The water isn't salty at all.
- No, it's not salty.

1872
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,170
(Spotting another one
on the right end)

1873
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,300
Hurry up!

1874
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,140
(Quickly collecting the box)

1875
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:24,270
A water bear.

1876
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:25,710
Hurry up, now.

1877
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,280
You have to bring one box at a time.

1878
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,510
Don't put it back.

1879
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,240
(Throwing to the nearest spot)

1880
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,680
Run!

1881
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,550
Swim back.

1882
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,620
We found many boxes.

1883
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:37,890
You have one minute.

1884
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:39,090
(They have 1 minute left,
so everyone enters.)

1885
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,660
(Swimming)

1886
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,890
(Quickly searching)

1887
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,400
(Finding 2)

1888
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,100
(Picking up quickly)

1889
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,870
Put these two on the table.

1890
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:56,770
Put them there.
(They only have 1 minute now,
so they can pick up 2.)

1891
01:03:57,770 --> 01:04:00,210
(Se Yoon finds the last box.)

1892
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:07,420
(They quickly pick up treasure boxes
as they're running out of time.)

1893
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:12,820
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

1894
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:16,960
six, five, four, three,

1895
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,590
two, one!

1896
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:22,060
(Time is up.)

1897
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,860
(Exhausted)

1898
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,970
- Gosh, it's cold.
- Goodness.

1899
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:28,070
(As they worked hard together
to collect the treasure boxes)

1900
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:30,710
- I think we collected a lot.
- Right, you collected a lot.

1901
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:32,510
The water is so clean, though.

1902
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:35,140
It's so clean and not salty.

1903
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,180
We should open the treasure box,
starting from this side.

1904
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,610
I'll open it now.

1905
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:41,520
- Okay.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1906
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:43,050
What are you doing?

1907
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,490
Isn't it a basalt?

1908
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,890
What are you doing?

1909
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,060
No wonder. This should contain
another rock then.

1910
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,190
This must be a rock.

1911
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:52,660
- Three?
- Three gold coins.

1912
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,460
Is this just a heavy box?

1913
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:57,130
It has to be heavy
since it has to sink.

1914
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,230
What is this?

1915
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:59,700
(It's a dud.)

1916
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,740
This is funny.

1917
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,900
They did this on purpose
so we would go far.

1918
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:03,900
Please!

1919
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,140
One.

1920
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,710
Treasures aren't found so easily.

1921
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,280
What's wrong?

1922
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,080
(It's a dud.)

1923
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,150
- What is this?
- There are only rocks.

1924
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:17,950
(They open 3 more duds in a row.)

1925
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,320
There's nothing.

1926
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,720
- There's nothing.
- You said we could find many.

1927
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,360
We struggled so much to find them.

1928
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,830
What are you doing?

1929
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:26,460
- Check that one, Jong Min.
- Okay.

1930
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,460
The last one. Please.

1931
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,870
Twenty. Please let it have twenty.

1932
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,500
Please!

1933
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,640
(Will a miracle happen
with the last box?)

1934
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:40,240
- Please.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1935
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,610
(They get 20 coins
from the last box.)

1936
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,980
(What is going on?)

1937
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,520
- They've come at the end.
- What is this?

1938
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,720
It's amazing.

1939
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:53,250
- It came at the end.
- What is this?

1940
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,820
(Feeling great)

1941
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,120
- Everyone.
- Awesome.

1942
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,790
As a result of
the treasure hunt the sea,

1943
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:00,090
you've earned 24 gold coins.

1944
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,600
How many were there?

1945
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,960
- In total.
- There were about 30.

1946
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,500
- We found many.
- We found many.

1947
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,300
You found the big one.

1948
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:10,840
I think this is a great spot.

1949
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,970
It's so nice.

1950
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:13,840
The water isn't salty too.

1951
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,280
- Families could come here to swim.
- Yes

1952
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,610
Let's play some more
since we're already wet.

1953
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:18,680
What?

1954
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,680
- We're already wet.
- When it gets a bit warmer.

1955
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,920
Let's find the rest of the coins.

1956
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,490
Let's move on to the second half...

1957
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,050
- of the trip.
- Okay.

1958
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:27,420
We have 24 gold coins.
We found many of them.

1959
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,660
- Yes. We found many.
- No one can find more than us.

1960
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,130
Get it together.

1961
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:33,130
(Meanwhile,
Team Big Ball is still quarreling.)
I understand.

1962
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:36,700
- Relatively...
- Did you all hear about the lock?

1963
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,570
- We all heard it.
- Even I understood.

1964
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,770
We'll let you do this.

1965
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:44,710
We had something for Round Three.

1966
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:47,980
(But there is a condition.)

1967
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:49,780
(The condition for Round 3)

1968
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,150
- We'll fill some water in the ball.
- Okay.

1969
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,550
The member who runs down the hill...

1970
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,580
will look
at the first letter hints...

1971
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,490
written on the earned coins...

1972
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,820
and unlock the lock.

1973
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,320
But the lock should be unlocked
with numbers.

1974
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:06,230
I'll give you this hint.
It's in English.

1975
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:09,200
(If it says "apple" in Korean
on the gold coins,)

1976
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,070
(they must enter
"apple" to unlock it.)

1977
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:16,540
(We'll still give you 4 gold coins
even if you fail.)

1978
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:17,740
(You did well, Joon.)

1979
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:19,710
If you succeeded in this mission,
we were going to...

1980
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:20,710
give you a big opportunity.

1981
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:23,510
Round Three was a chance
to quadruple your coins.

1982
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:25,080
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

1983
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:27,080
(They could have earned
32 gold coins.)

1984
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,580
- How many do we get now?
- We thought you would succeed.

1985
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:29,580
Eight?

1986
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:31,450
Yes. If you succeed this time,

1987
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:33,450
we'll double your coins.

1988
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,120
You're good at English, right?

1989
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,460
- Yes...
- Student.

1990
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,530
- Student.
- What's the spelling?

1991
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:38,560
S, T, U, D, E, N, T.

1992
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:39,660
- Okay.
- Succeeded.

1993
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,630
(Thumbs-up)

1994
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,400
(Sae Ho and Joon
enter the water ball.)

1995
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:47,740
(Seon Ho will run
in front of the ball.)

1996
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,600
This is nice.

1997
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,470
Let's go if you're ready.

1998
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:54,780
(They have to open the lock
with the letters...)

1999
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:55,840
(written on the gold coins
to succeed.)

2000
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,280
(Ready)

2001
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,450
(Let's earn at least 8 gold coins.)

2002
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:07,120
(Round 3 starts.)

2003
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:12,660
- We're moving.
- It's going.

2004
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,630
(The water ball
has a different charm.)

2005
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:15,860
What is this?

2006
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:17,730
What is this?

2007
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:23,100
(The older brothers are paying
the price for failing Round 2.)

2008
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,910
(Seon Ho reaches
the gold coin zone.)

2009
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:38,390
(The big ball runs after him.)

2010
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,560
(It's as if they're in
a front-loading washer.)

2011
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:46,190
(It came closer.)

2012
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,100
- Run!
- Run!

2013
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,430
Run!

2014
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,270
(H, U)

2015
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,740
(The ball moves ahead.)

2016
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:01,610
(Seon Ho speeds up.)

2017
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:03,080
Good.

2018
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,250
- Run!
- Run!

2019
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,650
(Will they succeed in Round 3?)

2020
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:10,850
What do I do?

2021
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,320
(Mission failed)

2022
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,860
I still don't know. What is this?

2023
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:27,300
(The human laundry
entered the spin cycle.)

2024
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,200
(They're exhausted.)

2025
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:33,170
I don't think he got it.

2026
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,480
- There wasn't enough time.
- He didn't get it.

2027
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,710
This came faster.

2028
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:37,310
It came faster than me.

2029
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,810
- Did you get the code?
- I still don't get it.

2030
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:41,450
- What is this?
- Let me see.

2031
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:43,380
What's "huben?"

2032
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:45,690
Huben?

2033
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:48,720
It's beach! B, E, A, C, H!

2034
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,260
I couldn't have done it anyway.
It came faster than me.

2035
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:54,760
(It was beach not huben.)

2036
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,530
- I couldn't outrun it.
- Unfortunately,

2037
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:58,430
you failed in your last attempt.

2038
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,170
As a result,

2039
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,000
- you earned four gold coins.
- Four.

2040
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,970
- Let's freshen up and go.
- Let's go.

2041
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:07,810
- Okay.
- Well done.

2042
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:08,880
Well done!

2043
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:11,010
(They earned 28 gold coins
in total.)

2044
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:13,050
(They need 60 gold coins
for everyone to sleep indoors.)

2045
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,850
We did well.

2046
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:16,750
- So well.
- We earned 24 gold coins.

2047
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,720
Do we have 26 gold coins?

2048
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,390
- We have 24.
- We have 24?

2049
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,490
This should be evaluated relatively.

2050
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,790
- That's right.
- If the other team got 16 coins,

2051
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:27,900
- we should just take one of them.
- The rest should be left out.

2052
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,030
Right. One of them.

2053
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:31,730
I wonder how it went with them.

2054
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,530
Should we call them?

2055
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,800
Yes. Call them.
Maybe they're still rolling.

2056
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,370
Seon Ho.

2057
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:39,870
- Yes.
- Are you done?

2058
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,740
We're moving to the next spot.

2059
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:44,680
How was it?

2060
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,480
It was hard.

2061
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,650
It was hard?

2062
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:49,780
What did you do? I heard you rolled.

2063
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:53,190
We had to roll 300m down a hill...

2064
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:55,320
in a ball.

2065
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,220
That would have been fun.

2066
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,690
(He just laughs.)

2067
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:01,000
Do you know what we did?

2068
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,330
What did you do?

2069
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,860
We went into the water.

2070
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,000
- That's better.
- I heard you went into the water.

2071
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:09,440
(We went into the water too.)

2072
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,510
We should keep this short.

2073
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:15,240
So, how did it go?

2074
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,140
Well...

2075
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:20,550
Did you get more than ten?
Is it up or down?

2076
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:23,280
Up, of course.

2077
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:24,750
Congratulations.

2078
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:26,520
- Congratulations.
- What?

2079
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,720
(He's startled.)

2080
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:30,260
Is it down for you?

2081
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,460
There's a story behind it.

2082
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:34,230
We'll tell you later.

2083
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,100
Forget the story.

2084
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,130
- Tell them not to come.
- Tell them not to come.

2085
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:39,800
Tell them we'll see them
after eating.

2086
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,770
- Really?
- We were hurt.

2087
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,970
They're telling me to tell you
that one of you got eliminated.

2088
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:46,940
The eliminated person...

2089
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,780
will know that he was eliminated.

2090
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,710
- Really?
- Yes.

2091
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:52,980
Okay.

2092
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,750
- Talk to you later.
- Okay.

2093
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:00,250
I don't think Joon is helpful
to our team.

2094
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,320
How is he like this?

2095
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,360
(They think Joon was at fault.)

2096
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,660
Zero points, and...

2097
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:06,160
- It was fun.
- Right.

2098
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,160
(It wasn't Joon's fault this time.)

2099
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:08,860
What do we do?

2100
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:11,230
We should sleep outdoors.

2101
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:16,200
But it was a really good experience.

2102
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:18,540
It was so fun.

2103
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:23,240
(They keep driving.)

2104
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:26,650
- Look at the fog.
- It's very foggy.

2105
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:28,480
Right.

2106
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,850
Are we going to the base camp?

2107
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:32,620
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

2108
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:34,690
But this is...

2109
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,490
scary.

2110
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:40,330
It looks like there will be ghosts.

2111
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,060
It's like they will come at us.

2112
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,530
(The place they're heading to
through the fog)

2113
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:47,740
(The final expedition...)

2114
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:49,400
(will take place here.)

2115
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,500
Do you hear me? Over.

2116
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:53,870
"Find the mint-colored
container building..."

2117
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,310
"that has the last treasure box."

2118
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:57,910
Is it there?

2119
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:58,950
- Jong Min!
- Run!

2120
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:00,550
- Over here!
- Run quickly!

2121
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,050
- What is that sound?
- It's here. Come with me.

2122
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:03,250
What is that sound?

2123
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:08,590
(It begins now.)

2124
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:12,790
(Team Taeutgae pushed through
the fog and arrived first.)

2125
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,700
(Hold on.)

2126
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:19,600
(They enter under
the security team's directions.)

2127
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:23,240
It really feels like
a haunted house.

2128
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,640
It's not scary at all.

2129
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,670
(He's bluffing.)

2130
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:26,840
What's here?

2131
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,510
This is intense.

2132
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:31,080
(They nervously park the car
at the entrance.)

2133
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,480
Come out of the car.

2134
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,110
Where are we?

2135
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,280
What?

2136
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,750
Let's go.

2137
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:40,290
Where are we?
Is it "Jumanji" again?"

2138
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:42,490
- What is this place?
- What is it?

2139
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:43,820
Where are we?

2140
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,560
It really is
as if we're filming a movie.

2141
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:48,360
- We...
- We want to film an adventure.

2142
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,260
- The soil is red too.
- What is this?

2143
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,530
It's like red clay.

2144
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:54,740
Well done.

2145
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,640
- Well done.
- Your clothes...

2146
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,040
Take a look around.

2147
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,370
What is this place?

2148
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:01,540
It looks more mysterious
because of the fog.

2149
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:05,180
The weather...

2150
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:07,650
It feels like there would be
a dinosaur. It's really cool.

2151
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,720
- Now...
- You can't see anything.

2152
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,720
Let's go.

2153
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,750
- Where?
- Where?

2154
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:13,150
There's a huge tunnel here.

2155
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:15,190
- Where are we going?
- I think that's where we're going.

2156
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:16,790
- What?
- You startled me.

2157
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,660
- What? You startled me.
- What is this?

2158
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,030
- Wait.
- What is this?

2159
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:21,860
- I thought they were hitting us.
- Why the blindfold?

2160
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,400
Why must we wear a blindfold?

2161
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,460
(Everyone wears a blindfold.)

2162
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,730
- Why...
- Do what you're told to do.

2163
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:26,870
- All of us?
- Why?

2164
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:28,500
- All of us?
- Just me?

2165
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,570
(Shocked)

2166
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,000
Is this the haunted house?

2167
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,870
- I love it.
- The haunted house?

2168
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,710
- Who do we go with?
- There's a car.

2169
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:37,780
They made the blindfold well.

2170
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:38,810
Where did you get it?

2171
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:40,310
I can't see anything.

2172
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:41,950
You can't see anything, right?

2173
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:43,250
- They won't hit and run, right?
- Let's go.

2174
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,090
Let's all move.

2175
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:47,320
- Okay.
- Where?

2176
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:48,420
What?

2177
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,790
- Don't take off your blindfolds!
- Where?

2178
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,090
- Follow me.
- I really can't see anything.

2179
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:53,130
Hold on.

2180
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,360
- Are we getting in a car?
- Yes.

2181
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,070
Where are we going
with our eyes covered?

2182
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:59,170
There's no one in front of me.

2183
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:01,640
(All members are forced
to get in the car.)

2184
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,670
- Do we sit here?
- Yes.

2185
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:04,100
- Do we put on the seatbelt?
- Push them in!

2186
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:05,440
- What?
- This is the seat?

2187
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,540
- Yes.
- Gosh.

2188
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,040
What's wrong with the seat?

2189
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,140
(Se Yoon is the last one
to get seated.)

2190
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:12,250
- What's going on?
- Do we just go like this?

2191
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,080
Are they going to
push us off a cliff?

2192
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:15,650
Let's go, everyone!

2193
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:17,050
Bye.

2194
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:18,850
- Gosh.
- Gosh, this is scary.

2195
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:19,950
Where are we going?

2196
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,560
- Nice.
- What's going on?

2197
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,990
(The car sets off
without any explanation.)

2198
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:25,430
What is going on right now?

2199
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:26,990
But I love these moments.

2200
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:29,500
- I feel great.
- This is crazy.

2201
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:30,530
Where are we going?

2202
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:32,470
The production crew
made a lot of preparations.

2203
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:33,530
I love these things.

2204
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,400
- What?
- I'm scared.

2205
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,300
- We're already here?
- What's going on?

2206
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,940
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

2207
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,940
- We didn't move much.
- We have to get off?

2208
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:41,980
Get off?

2209
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:43,780
What? Who are you?

2210
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:45,180
(The security team takes Se Yoon.)

2211
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:47,350
- We're getting off?
- What? Se Yoon is getting off.

2212
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:49,150
What? Is everyone getting off?

2213
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,250
- Is it some kind of maze?
- What?

2214
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,620
- What's going on?
- What?

2215
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:54,420
Why is it just me getting off?

2216
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:56,920
- Why did I get off?
- What?

2217
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,130
We must have to find each other
after being scattered.

2218
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,430
- What's going on?
- It must be some kind of maze.

2219
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,130
- We lost Se Yoon.
- This is too much.

2220
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,700
Gosh, I'm scared.

2221
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,300
It feels scary with my eyes covered!

2222
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,670
Why did I get off first on my own?

2223
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:11,670
(He disappeared into the woods.)

2224
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,510
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

2225
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:15,040
- Hey!
- What? Who is that?

2226
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:17,040
- It's not Se Yoon.
- Who is it?

2227
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,250
- Who is it?
- What's going on?

2228
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:23,250
(Another person
is forced to get off.)

2229
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,550
Take it slow.

2230
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:26,390
What? Did Seon Ho get off?

2231
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:27,960
- Seon Ho!
- Seon Ho is missing!

2232
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:30,760
- This is thrilling, though.
- Right.

2233
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,390
And it smells like the forest
when the door opens.

2234
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:34,530
It feels like we've fallen
into a strange place.

2235
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:36,400
What if there are snakes?

2236
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:37,700
What is all this?

2237
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,670
I think there will be
something grand inside.

2238
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:41,370
(They head into the heavier fog.)

2239
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:42,400
We've arrived at the next spot.

2240
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,240
- Bye.
- Bye. I'll be back.

2241
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,740
I don't have a clue what's going on.

2242
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,510
The floor feels different.

2243
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,440
Gosh, we're gradually moving down.

2244
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,680
It's an unpaved road.

2245
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,810
It's an unpaved road.

2246
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:54,050
(The shaking continues.)

2247
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:55,680
Hold on. Isn't this a cliff?

2248
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,120
No?

2249
01:16:58,550 --> 01:16:59,690
You're so cold.

2250
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:03,860
Gosh, we're turning.

2251
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,930
- Right. We're turning left.
- Right.

2252
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:07,460
Why are we going so far away?

2253
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,900
We're so far away now.

2254
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,400
We're here.

2255
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,200
- Good luck, Jong Min.
- Okay.

2256
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:15,140
- Gosh.
- I have no idea where we are.

2257
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:17,700
(In a jungle in Jeju,)

2258
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:23,380
(the production crew abandoned
the members separately.)

2259
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:26,250
Isn't this a cliff? They might be
planning to push me off.

2260
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:29,080
They're going to push me off
for being here for too long.

2261
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,380
(His imagination becomes extreme
with his eyes covered.)

2262
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,390
Are we heading inside somewhere?

2263
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:35,460
(With Jong Min as the last one,)

2264
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,560
I can't see a thing.

2265
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,790
(they are all led into
a mysterious forest.)

2266
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,700
(Tamra Treasure Island)

2267
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,730
(Tamra Treasure Island,
Final Mission)

2268
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:46,370
You can take off your blindfold now.

2269
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,240
My blindfold? Okay.

2270
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,400
I can take it off?

2271
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,940
(Groaning)

2272
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:53,370
There we go.

2273
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:55,480
Gosh, what is this?

2274
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:00,650
Where am I?

2275
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,520
Gosh, what is this?

2276
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:09,690
(The timer starts as soon as
they take off their blindfolds.)

2277
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:12,890
We're deep in the forest.

2278
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:15,400
(The cameraman in charge
hands over something.)

2279
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,630
Gosh, the light is blinding my eyes.

2280
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:18,670
(The cameraman in charge
hands over something.)

2281
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:20,370
"Find the mint-colored
container building..."

2282
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:22,200
"that has the last treasure box."

2283
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,870
"You succeed when all members
arrive in less than 10 minutes..."

2284
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:26,110
"and the flag is lifted."

2285
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:27,870
"You get 50 gold coins
when the mission is cleared."

2286
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:30,540
"Upon failure, 10 coins will be
deducted every 2 minutes."

2287
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:31,950
Gosh.

2288
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:33,080
(In the forest
that is 990,000m² big,)

2289
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,280
We're doing all sorts of things.

2290
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,580
This is a totally new experience.

2291
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,690
(find the mint-colored container.)

2292
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:39,750
Starting from now?

2293
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:40,750
(Starting from now?)

2294
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:42,620
I don't see a thing.

2295
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:44,390
Mint-colored container.

2296
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:46,260
Hold on.

2297
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:49,060
We came this way,
so this side was the sea.

2298
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:50,600
We came this way. I'll go this way.

2299
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,130
I'll go this way.

2300
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:53,500
No. It's this way.

2301
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,340
Right. Am I wrong?

2302
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,070
Is it that way?

2303
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:00,540
I definitely was dragged from there.

2304
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:02,140
I was placed here like this.

2305
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,380
(He struggles to depart
even after a minute has gone by.)

2306
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:05,550
Where am I?

2307
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:08,280
A mint-colored container?

2308
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,380
(Se Yoon starts walking.)

2309
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:12,220
We're in the jungle.

2310
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:13,690
Mint-colored container.

2311
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:14,960
What?

2312
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:17,390
Someone must've started here.
There's a flag here.

2313
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:22,900
(Se Yoon finds
someone's starting spot.)

2314
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:25,370
- Can I move now?
- Yes.

2315
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:26,430
A mint-colored container?

2316
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:29,140
How am I supposed to
find this place?

2317
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,940
(Sae Ho left around 40 seconds ago
before Se Yoon got here.)

2318
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:35,240
(Sae Ho missed something.)

2319
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,480
Se Yoon!

2320
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,310
Cheol!

2321
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:39,510
(Did you spot it?)

2322
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:40,710
Joon!

2323
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,520
Mint-colored container?
I don't think it's over there.

2324
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,120
(At the place Sae Ho walked by,)

2325
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,620
Cheol!

2326
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,790
(there was the treasure box!)

2327
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:56,200
(Hidden items for the members)

2328
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,760
(Telescope, compass,
transparent film,)

2329
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,070
(walkie-talkie 1, walkie-talkie 2,
forest map, megaphone)

2330
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:02,800
(There are items hidden
in the forest...)

2331
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,640
(that will help you
with the mission.)

2332
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,770
(Find the hidden item
in the treasure box.)

2333
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:09,680
Where are you?

2334
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,580
(Se Yoon also missed
the treasure box under the pillar.)

2335
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:14,580
I don't see a thing.

2336
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,020
Anyone there?

2337
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,220
(While Sae Ho and Se Yoon
went different ways,)

2338
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,290
What is this?

2339
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:22,020
(the treasure box
was totally missed.)

2340
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,290
Let's follow the light.

2341
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:25,960
(There's a light
that can be seen from afar?)

2342
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,090
(Jong Min found the main path
while struggling for a while.)

2343
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:29,560
Mint-colored container.

2344
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:30,930
(Jong Min found the main path
while struggling for a while.)

2345
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:32,300
Mint-colored container.

2346
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:35,970
What? There's a door here.

2347
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:38,100
What? There's a treasure box.

2348
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:39,310
(The treasure box is finally found.)

2349
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:40,910
Was I supposed to find
a mint-colored treasure box?

2350
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,140
What was I told to find?
It was a container.

2351
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:44,680
(We were told to find
the container.)

2352
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,680
"Find the mint-colored
container building..."

2353
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,750
"that has the treasure box."

2354
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:48,450
What's this then?

2355
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,450
(He still checks what's inside.)

2356
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:52,720
What is this?

2357
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,290
Am I allowed to touch this?

2358
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:58,490
(Jong Min has acquired the compass.)

2359
01:20:58,490 --> 01:20:59,630
A compass?

2360
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:01,130
(Compass:
The container can be found quickly...)

2361
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:02,860
(when used with the map.)

2362
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,970
Am I allowed to touch this?

2363
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,670
Am I not allowed?

2364
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:12,270
(Jong Min has acquired the compass
and has thrown it away!)

2365
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:13,810
(Please use me.)

2366
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:15,780
I think it's this way.

2367
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,110
(It seems like he's going to be
a big nuisance for this mission.)

2368
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:18,710
I must follow the light
no matter what.

2369
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:19,810
(He gets farther away
from Se Yoon and Sae Ho.)

2370
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:21,310
I just need to follow my senses.

2371
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,350
All members must arrive in time.

2372
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:25,620
(Joon was abandoned
at the most secluded spot in the forest.)

2373
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:27,150
We've already started.

2374
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:28,560
- We've already started?
- Yes.

2375
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,690
What? How do I turn this on?

2376
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:32,130
(He's struggling already
with just the flashlight.)

2377
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:33,190
Okay.

2378
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:34,630
Mint-colored container?

2379
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:36,760
(He calmly looks around the area.)

2380
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:38,830
We're deep in the forest!

2381
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:41,530
I just need to find
the mint-colored container, right?

2382
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:44,970
Hooray!

2383
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:48,070
Hooray!

2384
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,140
What? Is this a bomb? Gosh!

2385
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,510
What is this?

2386
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:54,750
(Joon finds the treasure box!)

2387
01:21:55,050 --> 01:22:00,850
(Joon has acquired the megaphone.)

2388
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:02,960
(Megaphone: Members nearby
can be found with the loud noise.)

2389
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,690
Okay. Nice one. All right.

2390
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:08,090
Here we go. Hello?

2391
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,230
Where are you?

2392
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:13,170
(Seon Ho was the closest one
to Joon.)

2393
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:15,000
Hey! Here!

2394
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:17,300
Where are you?

2395
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:19,910
What?
Where is that sound coming from?

2396
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:21,570
(He changes direction
toward the sound!)

2397
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:23,640
I can't see a thing with the fog.

2398
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,480
Se Yoon!

2399
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:26,950
(The two get closer.)

2400
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:28,110
DinDin!

2401
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:29,650
Hey!

2402
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,250
Who is that?

2403
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,490
Who is it?

2404
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:35,990
It's Seon Ho!

2405
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,060
Who am I?

2406
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:41,330
Is it you, Joon?

2407
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:42,600
Correct.

2408
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:45,000
Hey, Joon. What do we do?

2409
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,270
We're doomed.

2410
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:47,430
- Did you find it?
- I couldn't.

2411
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:48,440
(Joon and Seon Ho get together
after 2 minutes and 40 seconds.)

2412
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,840
- Follow me.
- Okay.

2413
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:52,110
I still found one member.
I feel a lot more relieved.

2414
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,810
I'm a person who has no fear.

2415
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,810
- But this place...
- Where did you get this?

2416
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:59,280
This? I did well to find it.

2417
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:01,410
Call the others.

2418
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:02,450
(They attempt to call the others.)

2419
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:03,450
How?

2420
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:05,750
Hey!

2421
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:09,890
(The others are too far away!)

2422
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:10,960
Will they be able to hear this?

2423
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:13,490
What is this place?

2424
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,860
Gosh, this place is huge.

2425
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,900
(Sae Ho is at a place where
Joon's voice can't be reached.)

2426
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:22,270
(It's the same with DinDin.)

2427
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:24,140
This must've been
someone's starting point.

2428
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:26,110
I think I'm heading in somewhere.

2429
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:27,870
I'm terrible at finding places.

2430
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:29,840
It's going in even more?

2431
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:31,540
I don't even know where I'm going.

2432
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,710
I might really get lost
at this rate.

2433
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:35,750
(Sae Ho, Jong Min, DinDin)

2434
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:36,950
(Se Yoon, Joon, Seon Ho)

2435
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:41,490
(No one was able to find
the mint-colored container.)

2436
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:44,120
(We will reveal it
to the viewers first.)

2437
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,230
(Container)

2438
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:51,630
(Joon and Seon Ho
are near the container.)

2439
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:53,570
By the way...

2440
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,640
You know what?

2441
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:59,210
It's a mint-colored container.

2442
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:00,640
I bet it's big.

2443
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,110
That's what I'm saying.

2444
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:04,440
I wonder if it is placed high up.

2445
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,550
It would cost a lot to do that.

2446
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:08,580
- Right?
- Yes.

2447
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:11,480
And there's the rental fee.

2448
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,990
The rental fee of the place.

2449
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:16,590
- Hang on. So...
- Yes?

2450
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:18,120
instead of a narrow space like this,

2451
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,160
it's more likely to be placed
in a wide space.

2452
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:21,190
Shall we go then?

2453
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,600
- We should split up.
- No, we can't do that.

2454
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:26,300
- In one minute...
- Are we meeting up here?

2455
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,500
We will meet here in one minute.

2456
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,600
What if you don't show up?

2457
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:29,970
I'll come in one minute.

2458
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:31,400
- You have to come. Remember this.
- Okay.

2459
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,810
I'll remember this place.
In one minute.

2460
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,110
Okay. All right. Start.

2461
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,050
Wait. Why are you going this way?

2462
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:41,710
- I'll go this way.
- No, you should go that way.

2463
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:42,920
- Why?
- Well...

2464
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,820
- You're a spy.
- No, I'm not a spy.

2465
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,150
- Go that way.
- You have another mission, right?

2466
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:47,450
No, I don't!

2467
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:49,690
We have no time to waste. Just go.

2468
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:55,860
Seon Ho!

2469
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:58,030
- What? Why?
- Come here. Hurry.

2470
01:24:58,030 --> 01:25:01,730
- I found it.
- Why?

2471
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:03,240
- Isn't this it?
- Who?

2472
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,270
(He found the container?)

2473
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:06,910
There's another way.

2474
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:08,680
(At the same time, Sae Ho is...)

2475
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:10,410
I should go this way.

2476
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,710
(Relying only on his hunch,)

2477
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:15,920
(he runs over and over again.)

2478
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,320
This is a good exercise.

2479
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,590
There must be something here.

2480
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:23,420
What is this?

2481
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,760
Is this it?

2482
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,460
(It seems like
Sae Ho discovered something.)

2483
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,460
I think this is it.

2484
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:32,430
Isn't this it?

2485
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:35,940
(Which member
discovered the container?)

2486
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,000
- I found it.
- Why?

2487
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,470
- Isn't this it?
- Who?

2488
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,610
It's me. Isn't this it?

2489
01:25:41,610 --> 01:25:42,880
(It's not mint-colored
nor a container.)

2490
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,480
What color is this?

2491
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:46,480
I don't know much about colors.

2492
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,280
I don't think this is mint.

2493
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,680
I don't know the names of colors.

2494
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,920
Let's go in anyway.

2495
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:51,920
I think this is it.

2496
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,050
(What about Sae Ho?)

2497
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:55,590
Isn't this it?
The mint-colored container.

2498
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:56,590
(Sae Ho, Container)

2499
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:58,060
What is this?

2500
01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:59,590
(He found the container.)

2501
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:01,190
Hey, this is it!

2502
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:02,560
It's over here!

2503
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,300
- You shouldn't be loud, Sae Ho.
- Why not?

2504
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:07,170
Now that you're here,
you should just wait.

2505
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:08,230
Really?

2506
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:10,240
But I should shout.

2507
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,940
This isn't fair.

2508
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:14,740
- Am I the first one to be here?
- Yes.

2509
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:15,740
- Really?
- Yes.

2510
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,640
(Energizer Cho found it
only by walking.)

2511
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,880
(Whistling desperately)

2512
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,210
- That much is acceptable.
- Okay.

2513
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,950
- I'll make a sound with my mouth.
- Okay.

2514
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,450
Did you find it?

2515
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:26,720
(Lee Joon and Seon Ho
were running hard in vain.)

2516
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:28,390
Go up.

2517
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,390
- What sound is this?
- Follow me. Go.

2518
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:32,160
- What sound is this?
- Follow me.

2519
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,860
- What is the sound behind us?
- What?

2520
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,560
(Water tank, Lee Joon and Seon Ho,
Sae Ho, container)

2521
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,770
(Actually, the water tank
is near the container.)

2522
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:40,670
(Whistling)

2523
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:41,870
It's over there.

2524
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:45,370
(They are closing in on it.)

2525
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:51,440
All the members should be here.

2526
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,880
- Where is it?
- Is there nothing?

2527
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,050
Where's the mint-colored thing?

2528
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:56,520
(At 9 minutes and 1 second,
Joon and Seon Ho found the container.)

2529
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,180
It's here!

2530
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:00,620
Those who have arrived
are not supposed to shout.

2531
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:01,620
- Really?
- After getting here.
Can we go and bring them?

2532
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:06,190
(However)

2533
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:08,830
- I heard the whistle.
- You did?

2534
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:09,900
Guys.

2535
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,030
It's been ten minutes.

2536
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:16,040
Now you can go
and bring the members.

2537
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:18,640
- Can we shout to them?
- Yes.

2538
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:20,410
It's over here!

2539
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:22,880
This is the destination!

2540
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,540
What if we get lost?

2541
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:25,750
That might happen.

2542
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:29,050
Hey! Se Yoon!

2543
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:30,350
(Sae Ho is shouting
near the container.)

2544
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:31,420
It's here!

2545
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,520
- What?
- It's here!
(And...)

2546
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:35,620
Did you find it?

2547
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,720
(Se Yoon was wandering
around the container at the moment.)

2548
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,860
- It's here!
- Where?

2549
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:40,630
- Here!
- Over here!

2550
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:41,630
- Is it there?
- Yes.

2551
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:42,930
- Come on up.
- Did you find it?

2552
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,500
- Yes. Where's Jong Min?
- I don't know.

2553
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,830
It's over there.

2554
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:46,900
- Se Yoon.
- That's the destination.

2555
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:52,940
Im Cheol!

2556
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:55,340
Jong Min!

2557
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:57,080
Jong Min!

2558
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,710
Over here!

2559
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:00,780
Jong Min!

2560
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,420
(Where on earth
are Jong Min and DinDin?)

2561
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,020
Over here!

2562
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:05,120
I see you.

2563
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,620
Okay. Come here.

2564
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:07,890
Okay.

2565
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:09,690
You're here. Where's Jong Min?

2566
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,620
- Isn't Jong Min here?
- No.

2567
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,890
- Jong Min!
- I heard Jong Min's voice.

2568
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:14,960
- Take this.
- Okay.

2569
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:16,160
What?

2570
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:17,930
I'll go and bring Jong Min.

2571
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,500
Okay. I'll stay here.

2572
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:21,130
Jong Min!

2573
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:22,470
(It's been 12 minutes.)

2574
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:23,740
Jong Min!

2575
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,770
I can't hear you. Where are you?

2576
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:28,370
Jong Min!

2577
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:29,510
(Jong Min is completely lost
in the forest.)

2578
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:30,580
Yes?

2579
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,210
Hey!

2580
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:33,810
I can't see anything here.

2581
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,880
- Hey.
- Jong Min, come here.

2582
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:37,280
Jong Min, over here.

2583
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:40,590
I see Jong Min.

2584
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:41,890
(Sae Ho sends a signal.)

2585
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,160
- Okay.
- We should run.

2586
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,190
(He found Sae Ho's signal.)

2587
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,760
(He starts running,
leaving the cameraman behind.)

2588
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,830
Okay.

2589
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,670
One minute.

2590
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:58,570
Come toward the light.

2591
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,110
Gosh, I'm sorry.

2592
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:02,180
- Hurry.
- How did you get here?

2593
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:04,810
Come toward the light. Run.

2594
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:06,680
(The members completed the mission
with their great teamwork.)

2595
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:08,410
Come here.

2596
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,980
(What is their final record?)

2597
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:13,120
Everyone is here.

2598
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:14,750
- This is so cool.
- I brought him.

2599
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,690
- He's here.
- Once you pull out the flag...

2600
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:18,260
- Hurry.
- Run.

2601
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:20,330
- One, two...
- Jong Min.

2602
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:21,490
- Three.
- Yes!

2603
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,330
(All the members have arrived
at the mint-colored container.)

2604
01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:24,360
It's 13 minutes.

2605
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,600
Please.

2606
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:27,300
You guys are amazing.

2607
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:29,640
- Your record is...
- Yes?

2608
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,340
- It's 13 minutes and 20 seconds.
- Okay.

2609
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:34,440
- Okay.
- We did a good job.

2610
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,040
- Hey, it was really hard.
- All right.

2611
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,340
How did you find this?

2612
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:38,540
- I don't know.
- Actually,

2613
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,850
I just found it
while wandering around.

2614
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:41,480
- You just did it without anything?
- I came without anything.

2615
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,620
I just got here without any items.

2616
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:45,320
- So...
- What's the mint-colored container?

2617
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,990
- This is it.
- You can't see it, can you?

2618
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:48,150
I can't see it.

2619
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:49,790
I found these.

2620
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:51,260
- What are they?
- They were...

2621
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:53,130
- A compass.
- a huge hint.

2622
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,730
- What is it?
- I had no idea.

2623
01:29:54,730 --> 01:29:55,800
They are...

2624
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,030
What matters is the result, anyway.

2625
01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:00,400
Why did you, of all people, find it?

2626
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:01,870
All right. Everyone.

2627
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:04,300
Here's the result
of the Tamra Treasure Island Trip...

2628
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,440
where you went out to find
hidden treasures of Jeju Island.

2629
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:11,910
You earned 68 gold coins.

2630
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,110
Do we get to sleep indoors?

2631
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:14,810
All of you
will get to sleep indoors.

2632
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:16,420
- Yes!
- Really?

2633
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:17,520
- All of us?
- We don't have to...

2634
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,290
- That's amazing.
- We're sleeping indoors.

2635
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,320
It's been a long time.

2636
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:22,420
- I know.
- It's been a really long time.

2637
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,360
Se Yoon, if we were 30 seconds late,

2638
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,490
- then...
- I'd have to sleep outdoors.

2639
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:27,930
One of us
would have to sleep outdoors.

2640
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:29,530
- It was so close.
- I feel like...

2641
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:30,560
I'm in a game.

2642
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,100
Isn't this where
"Narco-Saints" was filmed?

2643
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:33,470
- That's right.
- Is it? I knew it.

2644
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:35,100
Was "Narco-Saints" filmed here?

2645
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,340
This place is famous as the
filming location for "Narco-Saints."

2646
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:37,500
- Is this it?
- Yes.

2647
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,270
I thought it was filmed in Surinam,
but it was here.

2648
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:41,240
- They filmed it on Jeju Island.
- Right.

2649
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,340
The view was amazing.

2650
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,750
Seriously,
it was like a scene from a movie.

2651
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:47,280
We did a good job.

2652
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,920
- All right. Now,
- The base camp.

2653
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:49,920
we will go to the base camp.

2654
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:50,980
- Yes.
- Okay.

2655
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:52,020
Can I use this while sleeping?

2656
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:53,020
- You can use it to sleep.
- Okay.

2657
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:54,290
Good work, everyone.

2658
01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:56,720
- We had a good exploration today.
- I know.

2659
01:30:56,890 --> 01:30:58,790
- All the spots we visited today...
- It was fun.

2660
01:30:58,790 --> 01:31:00,760
- were like movie spots.
- Right.

2661
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,500
I'm glad that we found it.

2662
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,160
- We did a good job.
- We did.

2663
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,700
If we had failed,
you all would've slept outdoors.

2664
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,230
I can't believe
we all are sleeping indoors.

2665
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:09,840
- It's unbelievable.
- We are all sleeping together.

2666
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,170
(Everyone is excited
to sleep indoors together.)

2667
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,640
(But their exploration
isn't over yet.)

2668
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:16,680
(Next episode)

2669
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,150
(A mysterious island, Tamra)

2670
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:21,550
(The countless adventures...)

2671
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:23,450
(that unfolded on the island)

2672
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:26,190
(From caves filled
with the majesty of nature...)

2673
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:28,620
(to the refreshing ocean...)

2674
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,960
(and the vast forests)

2675
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,460
Hurry, Sae Ho!

2676
01:31:32,890 --> 01:31:36,400
(The explorers who set out
in search of true treasure)

2677
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:40,570
(And the journey has not ended yet.)

2678
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:44,300
(They desperately
search for something.)

2679
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,210
We should go over there.

2680
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:49,140
(At the moment,
they find something?)

2681
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,280
(What is the treasure
they are looking for?)

2682
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,620
(A thick fog has settled.)

2683
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:58,280
(The rain is getting heavier.)

2684
01:31:59,150 --> 01:32:01,890
(They set out on their way
in the bad weather.)

2685
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:04,290
(It is not easy
to become explorers.)

2686
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:06,460
(Are they giving up like this?)

2687
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:08,930
(Finally!)

2688
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,460
I came here to see you.

2689
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,370
(How will this journey end?)

2690
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:15,800
I want to go back!
