1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:01,640
(Who will go on the 3-Day-2-Night trip?)

2
00:00:01,641 --> 00:00:03,281
(They play ghost leg to decide.)

3
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:07,850
(The lucky winners are Joon...)

4
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:09,121
(and Se Yoon.)

5
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:13,391
(A luxury cruise to Ulleung Island)

6
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:16,090
(They take over a coin karaoke booth...)

7
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:19,161
(to film their own "Music Bank" on a cruise.)

8
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:23,531
(They enjoy the winners' privileges.)

9
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:26,071
(The dud members left the next day.)

10
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:27,917
(I've never been this happy about a dud.)

11
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:30,971
(The Se Yoon and Joon quiz for snack allowance)

12
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,181
(They take pride in...)

13
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:36,511
(their chillingly accurate guesses and moving sentiments.)

14
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:39,851
(Just when they were beginning to miss the other two, )

15
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:42,151
(Se Yoon and Joon face a decision.)

16
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:44,020
(Joon chooses Up.)

17
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:45,191
(Se Yoon chooses Down.)

18
00:00:45,591 --> 00:00:48,761
(The other members choose as well.)

19
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:51,861
(The members' ship appears in the distance, )

20
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:54,631
(and the Ulleung Island choir puts on a great show.)

21
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:59,101
(The 2 Days 1 Night team is complete at last.)

22
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,040
(What will the six members write...)

23
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,541
(in their Ulleung Island Notes?)

24
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:05,470
(2 Days 1 Night)

25
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:07,610
(Ulleung Island Up, Down)

26
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:08,710
- Okay.
- It's time...

27
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,310
to pick a travel agency.

28
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:11,650
Welcome, Team Down.

29
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:13,681
Welcome, Team Up.

30
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:14,881
Welcome.

31
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:17,220
We're on the same tour.

32
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:19,590
- Hello.
- Hello.

33
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:20,790
- Hello.
- You're in charge.

34
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,690
Yes, it seems so.

35
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:26,091
(Team Standing: Team Up versus Team Down)

36
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:28,730
We'll start the trip, then.

37
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:31,730
Those two. It's their first time on Ulleung Island.

38
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:32,900
Joon, have you been here?

39
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:34,270
- I have.
- When?

40
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:35,371
Yesterday.

41
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:37,370
We landed early this morning.

42
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:39,371
- I'm almost a local.
- Are you?

43
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,840
I feel like it.

44
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:43,051
The theme of this trip is...

45
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,511
My Ulleung Island Notes.

46
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:47,220
- My Ulleung Island Notes.
- Yes.

47
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:48,950
We'll travel around the island...

48
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:51,820
and taste the beautiful Ulleung Island...

49
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,361
as well as make lasting memories.

50
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:58,531
(From morning to night, )

51
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:04,671
(every moment is the island's most prettiest.)

52
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:09,810
(We'll begin the Ulleung Island trip.)

53
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,911
That's more than enough.

54
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:13,810
We'll start the first schedule right away.

55
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:15,681
- Okay.
- We waited a long time.

56
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:18,411
Shall we set off to each location?

57
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:20,121
What does Up and Down mean?

58
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:24,190
(What a sight.)

59
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:26,591
(It's amazing.)

60
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:31,791
(An island that looks like it was gifted by the deities)

61
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:34,830
(On Ulleung Island)

62
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:36,130
Grin, smile, smirk...

63
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:39,670
(Real)

64
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:40,671
What is this?

65
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:44,371
(Wild)

66
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:46,041
How do you catch that by hand?

67
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:51,651
(Road variety)

68
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:55,150
What fun things will happen on Ulleung Island?

69
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:57,450
Look forward to it. Shall we set off now?

70
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:58,451
2 Days...

71
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:00,390
- 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

72
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:01,720
(2 Days 1 Night)

73
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:04,461
The weather's amazing whenever we come here.

74
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:07,961
- Here we go, everyone.
- Yes.

75
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:10,231
Thank you for making the long trip.

76
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:12,800
We always chose Ulleung Island as the destination...

77
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,241
- we wanted to revisit.
- Right.

78
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:18,571
That's why when I heard that we were coming to Ulleung Island,

79
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:20,210
I wasn't annoyed by that.

80
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:21,911
- I couldn't wait to come here.
- Right.

81
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,610
I had good memories on Ulleung Island.

82
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:25,350
- Right. Food here is great too.
- Yes.

83
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:26,481
How beautiful.

84
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,650
It's beautiful to see how there's nothing here.

85
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:29,691
(Amazed)

86
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:31,650
(The coastal road stretches out extensively.)

87
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:32,891
Look at the open sea.

88
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:36,461
- Oh, my.
- The scenery is stunning here.

89
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,490
The color of the ocean reminds me of a sports drink.

90
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:41,037
(Visiting here is always a delight. What kind of day is ahead of us?)

91
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:44,200
(He's quite captivated by the scenery.)

92
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,031
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

93
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:48,841
It looks like we're going under the sun.

94
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:52,671
- We're going up quite high.
- Why are we going up so high?

95
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:54,071
We're supposed to go down, not up.

96
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:55,640
My ears are starting to feel muffled.

97
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:56,650
(In no time, the view of the ocean vanishes.)

98
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:58,650
(Here comes an uphill road instead.)

99
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:00,350
What if we have to jump down all of a sudden?

100
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:01,451
- Under the sky...
- Hey.

101
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:04,150
You know the thing where we have to rush down?

102
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,091
(Where is Team Down headed?)

103
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:09,761
- We should also...
- How beautiful. That's big.

104
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:12,491
I'm seeing a lot more people and cars than I expected.

105
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:15,831
Ulleung Island has seen significant development.

106
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:19,570
It's also on the rise as a popular travel destination.

107
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:21,471
So there are many construction projects here.

108
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:25,371
Moreover, Ulleung Island is famous for thistles.

109
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,340
- What?
- I learned a lot yesterday.

110
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:28,510
(He shows off his knowledge by mentioning thistles.)

111
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,010
So we're divided into Teams Up and Down.

112
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:32,280
Do you know what each team is doing, Joon?

113
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:34,921
It's so obvious to me. So I kind of regret it.

114
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,180
Why? What is it?

115
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:37,390
We're going up, right?

116
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:38,520
- Yes.
- Are we going hiking?

117
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:40,797
I bet we're going hiking, and they're going to the ocean.

118
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,030
You see, I came here yesterday, a day before you guys.

119
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:45,391
So I have a good feeling about my guess.

120
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,631
Well, I like hiking.

121
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,871
Right. But Ulleung Island is famous for its ocean.

122
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:52,130
I hear the ocean here is beautiful.

123
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:54,341
Right. So many people go to the beach here.

124
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,040
My gosh. But we're going up way too high.

125
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,041
(The uphill road continues.)

126
00:04:58,042 --> 00:04:59,371
I wonder where we're going.

127
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:01,857
- Why do we keep going up?
- You don't need this, right?

128
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:03,911
Come on. Director Joo is there.

129
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:06,462
- We're going hiking.
- If he's here, we're going hiking.

130
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,220
We're going hiking. My gosh. I knew it.

131
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:09,341
(The hiking lover shows up.)

132
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,491
- We've arrived.
- Let's go.

133
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:13,621
- What are we doing? Let's go.
- Okay.

134
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:16,260
We're at Bongnae Waterfall on Ulleung Island.

135
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:18,101
- Bongnae Waterfall. Yes.
- Bongnae Waterfall.

136
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:22,030
We're going to hike up to Bongnae Waterfall.

137
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,131
Sounds good.

138
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:26,201
- Hey, the weather is amazing today.
- It's amazing.

139
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:27,740
- It's not that hot either.
- Right.

140
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:28,901
It was hot earlier.

141
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:31,141
I bet Team Down got a better deal.

142
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:32,871
They'll probably go to the ocean.

143
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:36,211
- This is lovely.
- The air feels so fresh.

144
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:38,657
- The air is really nice here.
- I can smell the phytoncides.

145
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,161
- It's the scent of mountain air.
- The scent of mountain air.

146
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:43,351
Gosh, what's this?

147
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:46,351
- I've never seen this tree before.
- Right.

148
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:48,091
I've never seen this tree in Seoul.

149
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,461
There are many wild plants,

150
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:52,090
native to this island.

151
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:53,530
- Really? I can see that.
- Yes.

152
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:55,530
(Intrigued)

153
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:57,031
Gosh, they're wild plants.

154
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:01,571
(Ulleung Island has preserved its original natural ecosystem.)

155
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:04,671
(A volcanic island with fertile land)

156
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:07,981
(An isolated island embracing nature in its pure form)

157
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,480
(With fewer natural predators, )

158
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:11,110
(rare plants thrive all over the island.)

159
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:13,721
This place is the best when it comes to showing...

160
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:15,821
- Right.
- the magnificence of nature.

161
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:18,050
- The splendor of nature.
- Exactly.

162
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:20,131
(I can feel the breath of Mother Nature every step.)

163
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,990
The vibe here reminds me of Mount Bukhan.

164
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:23,130
(Let's go and check out the plants of Ulleung Island.)

165
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:26,030
There are many wild plants here.

166
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:28,031
- I said its vegetation was diverse.
- Right.

167
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,030
We invited an expert...

168
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:31,371
- Really?
- to teach us.

169
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:32,670
My gosh, hello.

170
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:35,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

171
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:36,740
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Cho Sae Ho.

172
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:38,440
- I'm Kim Tae Won.
- Hello.

173
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,640
- Hello, sir.
- Hello. I'm Lee Joon.

174
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:42,181
- I'm Yoo Seon Ho.
- I'm Kim Tae Won.

175
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:44,281
Pay attention to his commentary...

176
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,780
- Shall we start our walk?
- while walking to our destination,

177
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:46,820
- Bongnae Waterfall.
- Okay.

178
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:47,821
Yes.

179
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:49,080
Shall we get going together?

180
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:50,220
Before we go up,

181
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:51,720
I'd like to point out...

182
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,190
- two types of plants here.
- Sure.

183
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:55,890
Let's head up after we observe these first.

184
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:57,291
- Sure.
- This plant is...

185
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,151
- Up close...
- Isn't this just a weed?

186
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:00,930
- That's...
- I've seen this at my house.

187
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:03,430
- That's...
- Yes. This is a weed. Right.

188
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:05,901
- Right?
- But every plant has a name.

189
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:07,340
- I see.
- This is...

190
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:09,341
- I've seen it at a tennis court.
- By the time...

191
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:11,740
this one blooms flowers and bears fruits,

192
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:14,210
sticky liquid seeps out here.

193
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,780
- The name of this plant is...
- A sticky tree?

194
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:17,780
Hairstalk St. Paul's wort.

195
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:18,781
- Hairstalk St. Paul's wort.
- Hairstalk St. Paul's wort.

196
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:20,497
- I think...
- Hairstalker St. Paul's wort?

197
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:22,380
- Isn't it hairstalk?
- Yes. Right here...

198
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,290
- Hairstalker?
- Hairstalk.

199
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,320
- Hey.
- Hairstalk.

200
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,360
- I think we have to memorize this.
- Yes. Let's memorize it.

201
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:29,591
- They might ask us later.
- Can we write this down?

202
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:31,830
- Sure.
- Let's write it down.

203
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:34,030
- All right. Come this way.
- Hairstalk St. Paul's wort.

204
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:35,200
I can memorize it without writing it down.

205
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:36,361
No, you can't.

206
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:39,030
- What do you mean about me?
- I know you well.

207
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:40,871
- I said I could do it.
- That tree...

208
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:42,700
This plant is similar to what we just saw.

209
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:44,170
- It looks like the same one.
- An oak tree.

210
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:46,310
Isn't this the same flower we saw earlier?

211
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:48,151
- It looks exactly the same.
- It does, right?

212
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:49,480
- It looks the same.
- But...

213
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,380
when you look at this,

214
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,080
- the stalk...
- I bet this will be a question.

215
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,851
- is quite hairy, right?
- Yes.

216
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:57,890
So this one is called glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort.

217
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:59,090
- What?
- Glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort.

218
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:01,260
- It's stalk, right?
- Yes.

219
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:02,660
How is it different from hairstalk St. Paul's wort?

220
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:05,130
- This one is just a bit hairy?
- It's very hairy.

221
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:07,600
- So the name of this plant is...
- The hairstalk St. Paul's wort...

222
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:09,561
- isn't hairy?
- Right. It's not hairy at all.

223
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:12,000
- Glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort.
- This one is very hairy.

224
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:13,500
- Memorize it as Cheol the Stalker.
- That's the difference.

225
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:14,540
- Stalk.
- Okay.

226
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,770
We can memorize it that way.

227
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,017
Glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort.

228
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,110
We heard there are many wild plants here. Is that correct?

229
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:20,581
Right. On our way up,

230
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:25,450
when I spot them, I'll explain them to you right away.

231
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:27,250
- Okay.
- Sae Ho, try to memorize them.

232
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:28,280
Okay.

233
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:29,720
Hairstalk St. Paul's wort.

234
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:30,790
- Glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort.
- Glandular...

235
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,020
- Glandular...
- You're so bad at memorizing.

236
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:33,467
- I can't seem to memorize them.
- Seriously.

237
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:35,460
- What was the second one?
- Glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort!

238
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:38,091
- Glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort.
- What's wrong with you?

239
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,460
There's another cool plant here.

240
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:42,900
- This plant is only found...
- Here?

241
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,831
On this island in the entire world.

242
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:47,200
You can only see it here.

243
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:49,100
- It's a special plant to the area.
- Okay.

244
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:50,670
- Gosh, it looks like...
- All right.

245
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:52,240
- Can I guess what it is?
- corn.

246
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,681
- Sure.
- Isn't that a bitter melon?

247
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:55,340
It's not a bitter melon.

248
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:57,481
It's called a jack-in-the-pulpit.

249
00:08:57,981 --> 00:08:59,581
It belongs to the Arisaema triphyllum.

250
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:01,350
Let me tell you the history about this plant.

251
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:03,691
A long time ago during the Joseon Dynasty,

252
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:06,720
kings interrogated people regarding crimes.

253
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,461
- Right.
- "Do you know what you've done?"

254
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:10,130
- When kings accused them of crimes, - Yes.

255
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:11,360
They were punished with poisonous tonic.

256
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:12,730
(The criminals were ordered to drink the poisonous tonic.)

257
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:13,800
Did they make the tonic with that?

258
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,500
It was one of the plants used to make the poisonous tonic.

259
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,570
- Then if we eat that...
- My gosh.

260
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:18,600
- You could die.
- Really?

261
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:19,870
You could die from that.

262
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,240
- Then is that a poisonous herb?
- Are they separate?

263
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:22,570
- It's a poisonous herb?
- It's poisonous.

264
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:24,771
- Arisaema triphyllum.
- Gosh, this...

265
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:26,411
This is fun.

266
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:29,240
It's my first time here.

267
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:30,250
- Really?
- Yes.

268
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:31,550
- Come often.
- Yes.

269
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:33,871
Now that I'm here, I can see how beautiful this island is.

270
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:35,320
You can see the spiky parts.

271
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:36,321
- Spiky.
- Spiky.

272
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:37,350
- Spiky.
- Spiky.

273
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:38,351
Spiky.

274
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:40,061
- This is called...
- Spiky flowers.

275
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:42,190
Loose-spike smartweed.

276
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:44,461
- I see. Loose-spike smartweed.
- Loose-spike smartweed.

277
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:48,201
The locals here call this wooden pokers.

278
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:50,071
- Wooden pokers.
- Wooden pokers.

279
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:52,630
This is called island thistle.

280
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:53,841
- Island thistle.
- I see.

281
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:55,840
- Probably...
- I had that this morning.

282
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:57,240
- The thistle soup.
- Right?

283
00:09:57,241 --> 00:09:58,810
- You can find it at restaurants.
- It was so tasty.

284
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:01,010
You'll find this at every restaurant here.

285
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:02,380
It's so good.

286
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:03,481
- Right, it's good.
- Yes.

287
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:07,280
There are no thorns on the stems.

288
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,150
Right. You don't need to do anything.

289
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,321
- Right.
- You can just add it to the soup.

290
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:13,420
- I studied before you got here.
- Really?

291
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:14,890
- I'm serious.
- You learned a lot.

292
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:16,691
Of course. I'm a local here.

293
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:19,690
(The members learned several plants for 30 minutes on their way up.)

294
00:10:19,691 --> 00:10:22,330
(Hairstalk St. Paul's wort, glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort, )

295
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,630
(jack-in-the-pulpit, loose-spike smartweed, )

296
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:24,970
(island thistle, Bongnae Waterfall)

297
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:26,270
(Then they learned about a few more plants.)

298
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:27,817
(Ulleung maple, Ulleung bluegrass, rowan, cedar)

299
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:31,271
(Their lecture on native plants is over.)

300
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:34,140
The view here is stunning.

301
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:35,311
(Then they face...)

302
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:38,881
You could totally practice the three-level high notes.

303
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:45,321
(Bongnae Waterfall)

304
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:49,260
(Known as the lifeline of Ulleung Island...)

305
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:52,261
(with waterfalls flowing over 3,000t)

306
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:57,000
(A 3-tiered waterfall with a 30m drop)

307
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:58,731
(1st tier, 2nd tier, and 3rd tier)

308
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:01,740
(A beautiful sight of white torrents breaking down in the virgin forest)

309
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:02,771
It's cool here.

310
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:05,011
It's cool.

311
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:09,241
The waterfall is coming down into three tiers from the top.

312
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:13,251
(Shouting)

313
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:16,220
What a magnificent view, isn't it?

314
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:17,250
- It's stunning.
- Right.

315
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:19,051
(They're captivated by the picturesque view.)

316
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:20,960
(Meanwhile, Team Down arrives at the beach.)

317
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,767
- I guess we're going to the beach.
- It's Hakpo Beach.

318
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,960
I guess we're going to the beach.

319
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:25,790
Didn't we come here to catch something?

320
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,300
- Right. We went snorkeling here.
- Yes.

321
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:29,860
- There...
- We ate some food over there.

322
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:32,430
- That vacation home reminded me.
- The birds kept circling around.

323
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,541
- Right.
- Yes.

324
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:37,110
The beautiful emerald ocean stands out here at Hakpo Port.

325
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:38,170
I love it.

326
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:39,570
(Hakpo Port, embracing the emerald-colored ocean)

327
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,380
The shape of the mountain resembles a crane perching here.

328
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:44,480
That's why it was named Hakpo Port.

329
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:45,481
I see.

330
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:48,050
(The verdant, dense mountain...)

331
00:11:48,051 --> 00:11:49,971
(and the clear-watered ocean surround the port.)

332
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:54,061
(It's also famous as the beach with many pebbles.)

333
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:57,490
This is a popular snorkeling spot on Ulleung Island.

334
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:59,091
It's also the fishing spot of the ocean.

335
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,660
- Right?
- Yes, I remember everything.

336
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:05,000
(The 3 of them went into the water 5 years ago.)

337
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:07,340
- Why are we here again?
- Are we revisiting our old spots?

338
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:08,900
I got my hair done. I can't go into the water.

339
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:10,111
- But...
- Are we...

340
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:13,040
Have you heard of bare hand fishing for blenny?

341
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,110
- What?
- Yes, I know about that.

342
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,111
- That's...
- What's that?

343
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:17,081
(Say what?)

344
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:19,181
- Were you guys not here?
- I don't know.

345
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:20,450
What's bare hand fishing?

346
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:22,350
You just catch fish with your bare hands.

347
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:23,590
- Catch fish?
- Yes, fish.

348
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:24,920
- With bare hands?
- Yes.

349
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:26,561
- Isn't that common in the Amazon?
- I...

350
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:30,021
(It was 3 years ago around this time of the year.)

351
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,560
(Jong Min had to catch fish as a penalty.)

352
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:35,160
Did you catch loaches here?

353
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:36,161
Right. The loaches.

354
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:37,731
- You caught them here?
- Yes.

355
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:39,970
As you said, blenny is nicknamed...

356
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:42,741
the sea loach. It's a saltwater fish.

357
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:45,341
Many of them inhabit right here at Mongdol Beach.

358
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,911
Wasn't it fun when you tried it last time?

359
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:50,081
- When you touch them, - What?

360
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:51,780
- it feels so gross.
- Why? How does it feel?

361
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:53,110
They keep moving.

362
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:54,550
Wait. I don't get it.

363
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:55,750
- How do you catch that?
- You catch them with bare hands.

364
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:56,751
Catch loaches?

365
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:58,550
Yes. You have to catch loaches with bare hands.

366
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:00,121
Do we have any bait for them?

367
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:01,361
There is some bait.

368
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,120
We must catch them with our hands? But they're slippery.

369
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:05,030
- Why don't we go and try that out?
- Sure.

370
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:06,190
Jong Min has done it. Let's follow his lead.

371
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:07,200
Yes, I've done it before.

372
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:09,560
But we have to catch them with our hands without any tools?

373
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:10,870
It looks like there's no fish here.

374
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:13,230
But there's a ton of fish here. It's crazy. I was surprised too.

375
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:15,070
- I thought, "What can I catch?"
- Right here...

376
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:16,670
- You can't see anything, right?
- Right.

377
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,711
Watch.

378
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:19,911
Grab some squid here.

379
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,241
Grab the squid.

380
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:24,651
Grab it and pound it with a pebble.

381
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:26,580
- What?
- Target the end.

382
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,150
(Grab a pebble around you and flatten the tentacle.)

383
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:29,220
Flatten it.

384
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:30,450
(Grab a pebble around you and flatten the tentacle.)

385
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:32,851
- I see. Make it wide?
- Yes, make it wide.

386
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,690
Great. This will be easy to eat.

387
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,297
- It's easy to eat for the fish.
- What next?

388
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:37,591
- Look.
- Okay.

389
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:38,931
My gosh.

390
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:40,730
- I don't see anything.
- There's no fish here.

391
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:42,051
(Are you sure there's fish here?)

392
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:44,670
- Gently lift the pebble.
- Okay.

393
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:46,230
Stick it in between the pebbles.

394
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:48,040
(When a puddle forms after removing the pebble, )

395
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,541
(put in the squid and wait.)

396
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:50,771
Stick it in between the pebbles.

397
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:53,611
(What's the result of Master Kim's bare hand fishing?)

398
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:58,011
- What?
- My gosh. I got a crab.

399
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:00,380
(He caught something as soon as he put in the squid?)

400
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,651
- What?
- My gosh. I got a crab.

401
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:03,750
What's this doing here?

402
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:05,050
- We're not catching that?
- No!

403
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:06,590
- Not that?
- We have to catch blennies.

404
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,190
(I'm just a crab.)

405
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:10,261
No! Go away.

406
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:12,330
- That's not a blenny.
- Not that?

407
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:13,431
It scared me.

408
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:15,700
- I thought I got one.
- I thought that was it.

409
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:18,301
No! Go away.

410
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:19,671
Grab it and eat it.

411
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:22,840
- That's how it goes?
- That startled me.

412
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,071
(That startled me.)

413
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:28,491
- Kim Jong Min is amazing.
- There are so many crabs here.

414
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,480
Look between the pebbles. My gosh.

415
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:31,611
You can catch it right away?

416
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,350
(Screaming)

417
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:35,581
- What? That's huge.
- Oh, my!

418
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:39,800
(Did he actually catch one?)

419
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:40,974
(Screaming)

420
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:43,069
- What? That's huge.
- Oh, my!

421
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:47,869
(Did he actually catch one?)

422
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:51,578
(It's quiet under the water.)

423
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:54,879
(The blenny emerges out.)

424
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:57,819
- Crabs keep coming out.
- There are so many crabs.

425
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:01,488
- What? That's huge.
- Oh, my!

426
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:02,789
- My gosh.
- My goodness.

427
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:07,459
(Biting hard)

428
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:11,329
(Flapping around)

429
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:15,199
(What did we just see?)

430
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:16,999
Where did it come from?

431
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:18,469
My gosh!

432
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:20,108
What was that?

433
00:15:20,109 --> 00:15:22,009
(Shocked)

434
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:24,809
After that, you have to grab it with your hand.

435
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,009
- Gosh.
- No way.

436
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,009
(They still can't believe what they just witnessed.)

437
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,378
What is this? An eel just came out.

438
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:32,148
There can't be any hiding space under that.

439
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:33,448
Hold on. Let me try again.

440
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:35,589
(Great. I know what to do now!)

441
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,958
Here.

442
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,489
(He catches it.)

443
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,529
- I got two.
- My gosh. Over there.

444
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,229
(He catches two blennies at once.)

445
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:47,698
(Yes, this was the thrill of the catch.)

446
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:48,969
I want to try it.

447
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,069
(Unlike DinDin who tries it right away...)

448
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:53,739
I can't do it. I'm too scared.

449
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:56,039
This is really scaring me.

450
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,039
- How do they look?
- Here.

451
00:15:58,509 --> 00:15:59,709
They look like loaches, right?

452
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:01,609
(Screaming)

453
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:03,378
- Catch that.
- Hey, there...

454
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,278
(He misses it.)

455
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,889
The thrill of the catch is amazing.

456
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:08,549
There's the thrill.

457
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:11,759
(Let's start fishing now.)

458
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:15,629
(Shouting)

459
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:17,159
It's so scary. I can't do it.

460
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:19,819
How can I catch it with my bare hands?

461
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:23,799
(Feeling the bite at the same time)

462
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:27,639
(He still manages to put it in the bucket.)

463
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,879
That's it. Put some water in the bucket.

464
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,448
(I'm pulling it up.)

465
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:37,169
I'm sorry. Let that go. No, you can eat it.

466
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:39,989
(I'm sorry. Let that go. No, you can eat it.)

467
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,488
Gosh, it's eating a lot.

468
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:42,948
(He catches one after sacrificing the squid.)

469
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:44,189
It keeps on eating.

470
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,219
Pull it up.

471
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:47,689
Gosh, I can't do it.

472
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:50,999
(He catches another one as he whines.)

473
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:53,128
Hey, this one is taking my squid.

474
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,699
(Enjoying the thrill in the emerald ocean)

475
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:57,938
(Screaming)

476
00:16:57,939 --> 00:16:59,838
It took my squid! Hey.

477
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,969
- Look at that.
- Catch it.

478
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:04,709
(Jong Min's camera)

479
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,648
(A mysterious fish steals the squid.)

480
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,948
- Catch it. Hurry.
- It was this big.

481
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,395
- Hurry up and catch it.
- It took my squid.

482
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:15,048
- I told you to snatch it up again.
- Look!

483
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:16,688
- Catch it!
- Hey.

484
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:18,018
(It shows up again.)

485
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:20,058
- Look! Hey.
- Catch it.

486
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:21,659
(Terrified)

487
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,758
- Hurry up. It was huge.
- Catch it.

488
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,669
- Catch it.
- How can I catch that?

489
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,599
- Hey.
- Hey. That was so big.

490
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,239
It was so big, right? Wait, this is a crab.

491
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:33,438
- You'll do a group mission...
- Yes?

492
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,709
- for your lunch.
- Okay!

493
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:37,039
This is a bonus game.

494
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:39,179
I'll give you five minutes.

495
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,849
The one with the most blennies...

496
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:43,478
- will get steamed conch.
- What?

497
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,018
- The winner gets steamed conch.
- Steamed conch.

498
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:47,588
Only the winner will get steamed conch.

499
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:49,419
- It's an extra dish, not our meal.
- Right.

500
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:51,849
This will be an extra dish, and only the winner can eat it.

501
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:56,459
(Who will take the steamed conch from Ulleung Island?)

502
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:58,458
I'll give you five minutes.

503
00:17:58,459 --> 00:17:59,969
- Five minutes?
- Yes.

504
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:00,999
(The match begins.)

505
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:01,999
Okay.

506
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,269
(The match begins.)

507
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:07,909
(Only the winner will get the steamed conch.)

508
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,909
Can I get a glove for my left hand?

509
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,408
- Help me out.
- Time is ticking.

510
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:14,378
(While the ace, Jong Min, looks for a glove...)

511
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:15,609
Okay.

512
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:17,919
(DinDin catches one from the get-go.)

513
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,219
Okay.

514
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:22,118
One.

515
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,618
(Se Yoon catches up with a blenny.)

516
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:24,818
No. My gosh, it's a crab.

517
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:26,289
(No. My gosh, it's a crab.)

518
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,988
(He keeps on flipping the stones.)

519
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:30,259
This isn't a good spot.

520
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:32,198
Okay.

521
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,569
(DinDin pushes forward.)

522
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:37,598
Okay. I got it.

523
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,969
(Se Yoon quietly catches up.)

524
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:41,309
(Then he fishes out another one.)

525
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:43,739
Let go!

526
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:45,509
Let it go now.

527
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:47,348
What?

528
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:49,525
(There's Se Yoon Blenny who doesn't let go of the food.)

529
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,349
(This is so scary.)

530
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:56,088
(Its size is massive at a glance.)

531
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:57,719
Gosh, it's a crab. Go away.

532
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:00,759
(Meanwhile, Jong Min finally gets settled.)

533
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,788
Okay.

534
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:05,128
(He calmly tries to catch up.)

535
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:06,799
(Se Yoon catches another one.)

536
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:09,398
(He catches another one as he screams out loud.)

537
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,169
Okay.

538
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:12,539
(Impressed)

539
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:14,639
- What?
- I got two.

540
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,039
(4 blennies, 4 blennies, and 2 blennies)

541
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:19,939
There are so many crabs here.

542
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:21,648
Gosh, I only see crabs.

543
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:22,885
(What's the result of the bare hand fishing battle?)

544
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:24,779
It's been 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

545
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:26,279
Already?

546
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:28,189
Okay.

547
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:30,458
No! My gosh. Let me catch it again.

548
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:32,159
(Focused)

549
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:35,629
Darn it. I had it.

550
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:39,058
(DinDin and Se Yoon keep on losing their fish.)

551
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,499
I'm sorry. Eat this again.

552
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:42,998
(Meanwhile, Jong Min focuses on catching fish away from them.)

553
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:43,999
Okay.

554
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:46,669
- What?
- No.

555
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:48,709
Okay.

556
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:50,539
Okay.

557
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:54,109
(The number of his blennies goes up in no time.)

558
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:55,878
(The experienced fisherman gets the hang of it...)

559
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:57,418
(and tries hard to catch up.)

560
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,019
Okay. You have 30 seconds left.

561
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,189
(Their last-minute effort to catch more fish)

562
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:06,689
(Who will take the steamed conch?)

563
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:08,228
- Hold on.
- My gosh.

564
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:09,229
(Game over)

565
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:10,958
There are so many crabs here.

566
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,719
I couldn't catch a lot because of the crabs.

567
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:15,769
Tell me how many each one of you caught.

568
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:17,739
You didn't catch a lot.

569
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:19,438
I got six.

570
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:20,509
(Jong Min caught 6.)

571
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:22,368
I could've caught a lot more.

572
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:24,138
But I was scared in case I caught a crab.

573
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,679
I have 5, but 1 of them is huge.

574
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:29,308
(Showing off his blenny that could be as big as 2)

575
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:30,949
The size doesn't matter, the number does.

576
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,459
- Really?
- Sorry to break it to you.

577
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:35,449
Okay. Jong Min is in first place for now.

578
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,889
(Please...)

579
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,259
I have five.

580
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:41,958
(Jong Min wins by one.)

581
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,259
I won by one fish!

582
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,699
I'll give you the steamed conch during lunch.

583
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,798
Give me a lot.

584
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,129
(Chuckling)

585
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:51,098
- Experience does make a difference.
- You're indeed experienced.

586
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:52,099
Of course.

587
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,908
- Did you have fun fishing?
- Yes.

588
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:55,115
(Feeling life at my fingertips was thrilling and exhilarating!)

589
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:56,808
- Did you enjoy the waterfall?
- Yes.

590
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:58,008
Gosh, it's so cool here.

591
00:20:58,009 --> 00:20:59,338
- This is nice!
- This is putting me in a good mood.

592
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:00,348
All right.

593
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:02,778
- Let me tell you what we're doing.
- Okay.

594
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:04,618
- You'll have lunch soon.
- Yes.

595
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:06,519
- We memorized everything.
- Yes.

596
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:07,649
(In a tight spot)

597
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,188
- We're pretty smart.
- We're smart.

598
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:10,218
- We're not like the others.
- We're not.

599
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:11,888
- Seriously.
- Your lunch is at stake on this.

600
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:13,889
What was it? An aster? Right.

601
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:15,388
It's called Relay Jackpot Race.

602
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:16,689
- Gosh. What?
- We'll begin now.

603
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:20,058
- I'll give you ten minutes.
- Okay.

604
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:22,169
You will take turns and then take pictures...

605
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,239
of the plants in the ecosystem.

606
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,579
If you complete the mission within your time limit,

607
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:29,609
you can have all the dishes we prepared for you.

608
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:32,138
If you go over the time limit...

609
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:33,955
Will you take away a dish for every minute we go over?

610
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:37,479
We'll take away a dish for every minute you go over.

611
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:39,978
(They can't eat anything if they go over 15 minutes.)

612
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,619
If you take pictures of incorrect plants,

613
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:44,358
you must go back and take the pictures again.

614
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,718
Why did I choose Up? Team Down got a better deal.

615
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,189
No. Listen.

616
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:50,598
A crisis can turn into a chance. So...

617
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,198
A crisis is a crisis. How is that a chance?

618
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,398
No. You guys know this.

619
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,528
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

620
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:56,929
- Okay. Let's do that.
- All right.

621
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:01,608
(They focused and studied the plants more intently than before.)

622
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:02,708
- Glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort.
- Yes.

623
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:03,978
- What was that?
- Loose...

624
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:08,009
(How much will they remember about 10 types of plants?)

625
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,848
- You'll get hurt.
- Are you ready?

626
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:11,218
Go slowly. Jog instead of running.

627
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:12,459
I'll pick one before the start.

628
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:13,848
Get ready.

629
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:16,389
(Will they remember what they learned?)

630
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:18,359
Set, go.

631
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:21,088
It's glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort. Run.

632
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,188
- This is good.
- It's good. You know what it is.

633
00:22:23,189 --> 00:22:24,228
(Question for Seon Ho, glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort)

634
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:25,698
(Rushing)

635
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:27,059
- All right.
- I feel bad for him.

636
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:31,568
(Where they saw the glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort)

637
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:32,969
The name of this plant is...

638
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:37,709
(The rest area at the entrance of the waterfall path)

639
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:39,708
He has to go to the entrance.

640
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:43,149
(The round trip takes over 5 minutes even if you run.)

641
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:46,919
(Of all places, it's the farthest spot.)

642
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:48,649
This is an emergency.

643
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:51,389
I got the farthest one. The glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort.

644
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:54,829
(What do I do when I climb up?)

645
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:57,635
The glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort. It's a yellow plant.

646
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:58,959
Was there any on our way here?

647
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,799
Was there any on the way?

648
00:23:03,129 --> 00:23:04,769
Do I really have to go all the way there?

649
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:07,739
Let's go, Seon Ho.

650
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:11,179
Seon Ho, you have to go farther.

651
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,949
Seon Ho, you have to go all the way down.

652
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:15,948
- We can tell from here.
- Sir.

653
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:18,069
As the glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort is everywhere,

654
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:19,709
Seon Ho is taking a photo of something.

655
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:21,018
- Really?
- Yes.

656
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:22,789
(Already?)

657
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:24,618
(Where they learned about it is much farther away.)

658
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,058
Do I really have to go all the way there?

659
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:28,419
(From Bongnae Waterfall to glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort)

660
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:31,529
Here it is.

661
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:33,098
I found it.

662
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,699
(Yellow flowers in the fallen heap)

663
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:37,738
I found it. This is it.

664
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:39,538
(He is sure of it and runs back.)

665
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,269
- Was there hair on it?
- Yes.

666
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:43,878
He found it.

667
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:44,879
Seriously?

668
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:49,709
(Steps full of confidence)

669
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:52,078
- Hurry up.
- This is easy.

670
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,218
- This is a windfall.
- Are you sure?

671
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:55,319
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

672
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,519
Here you go.

673
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,458
Gosh, I'm tired.

674
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:00,189
(No way)

675
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:01,988
This is correct. Success.

676
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:03,029
(This is correct.)

677
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:05,529
- Seriously?
- Here I go.

678
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,799
This is correct. Success.

679
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:10,869
(Seon Ho succeeded in 1 minute.)

680
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:12,299
Sir.

681
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,338
- Wait.
- It's loose-spike smartweed.

682
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:16,769
- It's right below us.
- Let's go.

683
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:19,979
(Why is it right below us?)

684
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,349
This plant is...

685
00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:24,948
(Pretty loose-spike smartweed that resembled grains)

686
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:26,589
- Loose-spike...
- Loose-spike smartweed.

687
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:30,519
(It was also quite far away.)

688
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:34,889
(Is it right below?)

689
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:38,129
(The cameraman in charge takes his place.)

690
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:40,428
(Is Sae Ho not coming?)

691
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:42,469
(What's going on?)

692
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:46,699
(Sae Ho is going back up.)

693
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,709
Actually, it was under the bridge.

694
00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:51,439
(Laughing)

695
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:53,579
(What?)

696
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:57,179
(10 minutes ago at the bridge in front of the waterfall)

697
00:24:57,549 --> 00:24:58,879
What was this called?

698
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:01,179
- Loose-spike smartweed.
- Loose-spike smartweed.

699
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:03,449
No... That one?

700
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,058
Is that loose-spike smartweed?

701
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:06,119
You're right.

702
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:08,529
It was under the bridge.

703
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:10,159
I hope that he's wrong.

704
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,759
Is it correct? Okay.

705
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,629
- I got it.
- All right.

706
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:15,998
- We studied hard.
- Here I go.

707
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,939
(Loose-spike smartweed is correct.)

708
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:22,109
(We expected them to take time being lost in the thick forest.)

709
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:25,338
(2 people succeeded in 2 minutes.)

710
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:26,579
- Here I go.
- Okay.

711
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:27,909
Here I go.

712
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:29,878
- Jack-in-the-pulpit.
- Jack-in-the-pulpit.

713
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:30,879
- That one is...
- No.

714
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,278
- It's a little farther away.
- Hurry.

715
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,089
- I'll be back.
- Bitter melon.

716
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:36,149
- You know which one it is?
- I do.

717
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:40,629
(The plant for the mission is quite far away.)

718
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,029
Jack-in-the-pulpit.

719
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:46,029
Pulpit.

720
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:47,928
Pulpit.

721
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:49,798
(A plant that was used to make poisonous tonic)

722
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,099
This one is quite far away.

723
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:53,099
Joon, you have to go down farther.

724
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:55,709
I think it was farther.

725
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:57,279
You have to keep going.

726
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,508
(From Bongnae Waterfall to jack-in-the-pulpit)

727
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:01,708
(Joon descends while looking around carefully.)

728
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:02,709
Pulpit.

729
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,018
(The jack-in-the-pulpit is nowhere to be seen.)

730
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:05,649
Jack-in-the-pulpit.

731
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:08,649
It's far.

732
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:11,518
I bet Joon spotted it.

733
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,089
Right. He definitely knows.

734
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,879
- You know what it looks like.
- Yes, like a bitter melon.

735
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:17,729
Poisonous tonic.

736
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:19,359
Jack-in-the-pulpit.

737
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,668
This must be rare because it's poisonous.

738
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:23,989
It was made into poisonous tonic.

739
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,198
I don't want to go down farther.

740
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,538
(He has no choice but to keep going down.)

741
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:28,609
Jack-in-the-pulpit.

742
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:31,739
I'm so unlucky.

743
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:33,239
Seriously.

744
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:36,078
I have to keep going down.

745
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,019
(It always happens to me only.)

746
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:41,288
I came down very far.

747
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:42,418
(He's forced to descend.)

748
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:43,619
Why isn't Joon back yet?

749
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,289
We have four minutes left. He needs to come back.

750
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:48,979
- How many minutes do we have?
- We have four minutes left.

751
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:50,729
Jack...

752
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,858
(He also needs time to go back up.)

753
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:52,859
It's not here.

754
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,099
I know what that is, but...

755
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:58,499
I found it. Here it is.

756
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,039
(Did he find it?)

757
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,108
Okay.

758
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:02,308
This is tiresome.

759
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:04,779
(He takes a photo of something and returns to the waterfall.)

760
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:08,779
(Rough uphill)

761
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:11,049
- I found it.
- You need to hurry.

762
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,149
I found it.

763
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:14,149
- He found it.
- This is still hard.

764
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:16,889
Hurry up.

765
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:20,319
We won't know if he gets it wrong.

766
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:22,658
- What?
- We won't know if he gets it wrong.

767
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:23,828
- Right.
- I'm definitely right.

768
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:25,529
If he's wrong, I'll leave this team.

769
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:28,129
- Is this jack-in-the-pulpit?
- I'm a graduate student.

770
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:33,399
(A plant that was used to make poisonous tonic)

771
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:36,439
(Did Joon remember it?)

772
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:42,079
(What will be the result?)

773
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:44,978
- You can do it.
- We can do it.

774
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:46,479
We can do it.

775
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,788
(Jack-in-the-pulpit is correct.)

776
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:50,918
- That was easy.
- As you explained to us so well,

777
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,358
we could remember it easily.

778
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,458
- It was so easy.
- It was my honor.

779
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:54,528
Thank you.

780
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:56,489
- I'll remember it forever.
- Thank you.

781
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,028
- Loose-spike.
- I will remember...

782
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:00,528
glandular-stalk St. Paul's wort forever.

783
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:02,628
Before the opening segment next week,

784
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:04,299
we'll forget all about it. I know us.

785
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,439
Thank you.

786
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,200
- I'll forget tomorrow morning.
- All right.

787
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:09,639
- We'll go to the restaurant now.
- Okay.

788
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,839
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

789
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:16,249
All right, let's get going.

790
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:21,349
We will play the Random Lunch Game.

791
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,788
It's called Foot Fishing Fisherman.

792
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,358
- Foot Fishing?
- What's foot fishing?

793
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:27,429
- What is it?
- It will be a team game.

794
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:29,628
In three minutes,

795
00:28:29,629 --> 00:28:31,829
- you must catch 20 fish.
- What?

796
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,629
What kind of fish is there?

797
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:36,199
- Please bring in the fish.
- Control yourself.

798
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:38,098
This looks nice.

799
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:39,498
(The fish appear.)

800
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:44,638
(Dozens of fish swimming in the wide sea)

801
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,879
One member will hold fishing rods with both of his feet.

802
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,348
The remaining two members will catch the fish...

803
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:51,719
by moving the legs of the one holding the fishing rods.

804
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:53,148
In three minutes,

805
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,829
- you must catch 20 fish.
- Catch 20 fish?

806
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:56,148
That's so many.

807
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:59,518
Every time you succeed, you'll get one portion.

808
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,559
We need to know the menu to feel motivated.

809
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:03,358
The menu is perfect for today's weather.

810
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,439
Is it something refreshing?

811
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:05,929
Is it cold sashimi soup?

812
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,399
(Correct)

813
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,298
(Mixing fresh raw fish from the clean sea by Ulleung Island...)

814
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:13,739
(with cool and tangy seasoning)

815
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,808
(The mission with Ulleung Island cold sashimi soup at stake)

816
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:20,038
The cold sashimi soup here is incredible.

817
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,885
Cold sashimi soup from Ulleung Island. You know that, right?

818
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:22,979
It sounds good.

819
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:25,048
I should hold the fishing rods.

820
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:26,878
My legs are the lightest.

821
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:28,348
It'll be easier for you to move them.

822
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,548
They're also the shortest, so we can stay near the fish.

823
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:32,659
(You're right.)

824
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:34,459
- So I agree with you.
- Okay.

825
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,988
Once you're ready, let's get started.

826
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:37,999
- Okay.
- Okay.

827
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:41,198
- It's best to stick them here.
- Like that?

828
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:42,199
(His grip of the fishing rods looks stable.)

829
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,469
It's up to you. How about doing it like this?

830
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,298
This is totally possible.

831
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:48,108
- Can you back up a little?
- Shall I lie down?

832
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:49,508
Let's start with the ones with big mouths.

833
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:51,109
- Okay.
- Yes.

834
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,778
- The ones with small mouths...
- Do you have to wait...

835
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:54,778
until the fish closes its mouth?

836
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:57,308
You have to snatch them up after hooking onto them.

837
00:29:57,309 --> 00:29:58,679
This could work too.

838
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:02,488
(Will they be able to eat cold sashimi soup?)

839
00:30:02,489 --> 00:30:03,689
- Get ready...
- Here it is.

840
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:05,918
(Start)

841
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:06,959
Okay.

842
00:30:08,689 --> 00:30:11,898
(They catch one as soon as they start.)

843
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:13,529
- I'm going to relax.
- Relax.

844
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,199
Hurry up. We don't have time.

845
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,699
What are you doing, Se Yoon?

846
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:18,138
What are you doing, Se Yoon?

847
00:30:18,139 --> 00:30:19,238
- What are you doing?
- I got it.

848
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,738
- What are you doing?
- Be quiet.

849
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:22,209
- Don't talk to me.
- Okay.

850
00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:23,509
Be quiet.

851
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:24,739
That's it.

852
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:26,139
Push it off.

853
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:28,208
- I pulled out my foot.
- What are you doing?

854
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,278
Relax.

855
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,918
- I'll move the ankle.
- Se Yoon, you're terrible.

856
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:32,119
What are you doing, Se Yoon?

857
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:34,449
This is harder than you think.

858
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:36,548
(Extremely serious)

859
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:38,489
What's going on? I got it now.

860
00:30:39,189 --> 00:30:40,929
I got it. This is it.

861
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:42,759
- I got it.
- Yes, I caught it.

862
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:44,458
I got the hang of it.

863
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:45,898
(The fishing ace got the hang of the foot fishing.)

864
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,258
Jong Min is good at it.

865
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:48,429
(Jong Min is the best.)

866
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:49,699
(Se Yoon, on the other hand...)

867
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,899
This one didn't work.

868
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:54,309
(He only caught one.)

869
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:56,008
- Why are you so bad at it?
- This isn't easy.

870
00:30:56,009 --> 00:30:57,168
Don't move.

871
00:30:57,169 --> 00:30:58,278
I'm not moving.

872
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,409
Don't move.

873
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:01,249
Okay.

874
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:03,478
Get out of the way. Don't move.

875
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:05,279
(The rascal is only disturbing them.)

876
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,549
Se Yoon, what are you doing?

877
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:09,049
What are you doing?

878
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:10,758
You have to wait.

879
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,688
- Keep it inside and wait.
- Okay.

880
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:14,729
(Jong Min caught another one.)

881
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:16,459
Jong Min and Se Yoon, you must wait.

882
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:17,659
That's it.

883
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:20,768
Isn't it better to catch the ones in the middle?

884
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:22,798
The ones on the side have small mouths.

885
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:23,899
I know.

886
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,268
- Okay.
- Jong Min is good at it.

887
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:28,109
- Goodness.
- Okay, I got it.

888
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:32,379
(Even at a glance, it's a considerable pile of fish.)

889
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,478
- Five, four, - Their mouths...

890
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:37,248
- three, two, one.
- No, don't move.

891
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:38,448
(It's over.)

892
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:39,878
- All right.
- He's amazing at it.

893
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:42,019
Jong Min is really good at it.

894
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:44,048
- How did you do it?
- I will count.

895
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:46,559
- It'd be better without you.
- Two, four,

896
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:48,788
- six, eight, ten, - I was just filling the spot.

897
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:50,228
Twelve, fourteen,

898
00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:52,429
sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-two.

899
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,429
- We got it.
- We made it.

900
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,128
Jong Min did an amazing job.

901
00:31:56,129 --> 00:31:57,769
- It's a success.
- Okay.

902
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,068
- What?
- Did you mean that you were...

903
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:00,909
- good at this kind of fishing?
- Exactly.

904
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:03,408
- You're good at this fishing.
- Did you not like the fish?

905
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:05,039
- Right?
- Yes.

906
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:06,179
I'm experienced.

907
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,548
Okay.

908
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:09,278
- It's Se Yoon's turn.
- Se Yoon.

909
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,918
- Let's start.
- How will I lift his leg?

910
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,819
(It's finally time for Se Yoon's fishing rods.)

911
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:14,889
His one leg weighs 40kg.

912
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:17,318
What's this?

913
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,558
Don't do it like that.

914
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,889
(Heavy)

915
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:23,429
(His own legs are too heavy for him.)

916
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:25,228
Se Yoon, move up.

917
00:32:25,229 --> 00:32:26,299
(Screaming)

918
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,798
(It's so heavy.)

919
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,798
It's so heavy.

920
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,269
(Who told you to get fat?)

921
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:34,049
- You could've caused trouble.
- Goodness.

922
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:36,968
- Get ready...
- Wait.

923
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:39,478
- Stop moving.
- Stop moving.

924
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:40,709
Hold onto his ankles.

925
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:44,819
Okay.

926
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:46,779
- Okay.
- Gosh, it's so heavy.

927
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:48,488
It's really heavy.

928
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:50,549
- It's hard to control the rod.
- My goodness.

929
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:51,919
(Upset)

930
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,089
It's so heavy.

931
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:54,289
What's going on?

932
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:55,789
You're doing well.

933
00:32:56,589 --> 00:32:58,099
Stop moving.

934
00:32:58,459 --> 00:32:59,459
Goodness.

935
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:00,459
I can't lift it.

936
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,229
My wrist is hurting.

937
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:03,898
(Is he happy?)

938
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:04,968
Stop moving.

939
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:06,739
I got one. Okay.

940
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,209
You're good.

941
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:10,538
It's heavy. Stay still.

942
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:11,609
My lower back hurts.

943
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:12,978
Gosh, this is...

944
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:15,299
- My lower back hurts so much.
- Lose weight on your legs.

945
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:16,509
(Time of pain and patience passed by.)

946
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,118
Stay still.

947
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,919
I'm fishing, and my lower back hurts so much.

948
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:23,349
(Time is up.)

949
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:24,918
That was so hard.

950
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,819
(They're injured.)

951
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:29,488
(Please give me back my lower back.)

952
00:33:29,489 --> 00:33:30,528
What's wrong?

953
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:31,598
(Is cold sashimi soup this hard to get?)

954
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,599
That was so hard.

955
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:34,799
What's wrong? We had fun.

956
00:33:36,569 --> 00:33:38,169
It was like catching a shark.

957
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:40,169
Let's count.

958
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:41,569
We didn't catch many.

959
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:42,909
Two fish?

960
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:44,678
Two, four,

961
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:46,409
six, eight.

962
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:49,848
- We're short on 2.
- You caught 18 fish.

963
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:51,978
With 18 fish, you failed.

964
00:33:51,979 --> 00:33:54,079
(They fail Round 2.)

965
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:55,748
My goodness.

966
00:33:55,749 --> 00:33:56,848
(So far, they won 1 portion.)

967
00:33:56,849 --> 00:33:58,818
Here we go again. Get ready.

968
00:33:58,819 --> 00:33:59,819
(Their last attempt)

969
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,728
(Start)

970
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:03,628
You don't have to pull it hard. Take your time.

971
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:05,535
(Their last chance to win Ulleung Island's cold sashimi soup)

972
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:06,659
- Okay.
- That's it.

973
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,929
(He's still struggling.)

974
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:11,939
When it closes its mouth, pull it out. That's it.

975
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:13,898
Pull it out when it closes, Se Yoon.

976
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:14,969
- I got it.
- That's it.

977
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:16,208
DinDin, what are you doing?

978
00:34:16,209 --> 00:34:17,209
(Desperate)

979
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,338
(1 minute passed.)

980
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:19,438
Fishing is about waiting.

981
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:20,509
One minute passed.

982
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:23,009
(Under the pouring sunlight on Ulleung Island)

983
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:25,148
- Okay.
- Wait. You should wait.

984
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:26,248
Bite it.

985
00:34:26,249 --> 00:34:27,818
(We just need to catch a few more fish.)

986
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:30,418
Wait.

987
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:31,488
- Okay.
- That's it.

988
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,919
(Let's go.)

989
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,459
This is good.

990
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,259
We have a good chance.

991
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:37,529
(The pile of fish is quite big.)

992
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,759
Be patient. Don't rush.

993
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:40,358
From now on, it's about concentration.

994
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:41,828
We only have a few, so we must concentrate.

995
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:42,899
(What will be the result?)

996
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,228
(Time is up.)

997
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:46,198
- All right. Your time is up.
- We got a lot.

998
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,398
- Yes, we caught a lot.
- Let's see.

999
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:48,469
We caught a lot.

1000
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:49,768
(If it's more than 20, they'll succeed.)

1001
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:52,238
- Two, four, - We're veterans.

1002
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,239
Six, eight, ten,

1003
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,008
twelve, fourteen, sixteen...

1004
00:34:57,009 --> 00:34:58,226
(Please let it be over 20.)

1005
00:34:58,236 --> 00:34:59,079
(If it's more than 20, they'll succeed.)

1006
00:34:59,103 --> 00:35:01,372
- Two, four, - We're veterans.

1007
00:35:01,373 --> 00:35:03,642
Six, eight, ten,

1008
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:07,182
twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty.

1009
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:08,442
- Twenty-three.
- Okay.

1010
00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:09,542
- I'll take out three.
- Wait...

1011
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:12,512
(They caught 23 fish and cleared the mission.)

1012
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:13,713
I will take out three.

1013
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,952
(Humiliated)

1014
00:35:16,953 --> 00:35:18,852
You won lunch for two people.

1015
00:35:18,853 --> 00:35:19,853
(They won lunch for 2 people.)

1016
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:20,963
Shall we go and eat?

1017
00:35:21,763 --> 00:35:22,763
I'm hungry. Let's go.

1018
00:35:22,763 --> 00:35:23,763
Wash your hands.

1019
00:35:23,763 --> 00:35:24,763
(They worked hard to win their precious lunch.)

1020
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:25,933
Okay.

1021
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,893
I'm sitting here. The conches are mine.

1022
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:29,163
Goodness.

1023
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:31,102
The conches are mine.

1024
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:33,209
They gave us two bowls. The conches are yours, right?

1025
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:34,272
There are many conches.

1026
00:35:34,273 --> 00:35:35,772
- Share with us.
- Then you can share them with us.

1027
00:35:35,773 --> 00:35:36,773
I'm sorry.

1028
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:38,072
Today's lunch menu is...

1029
00:35:38,073 --> 00:35:40,753
cold seasonal sashimi soup from a popular restaurant on the Island.

1030
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:44,313
(Various types of fish living in the clean sea)

1031
00:35:45,153 --> 00:35:49,123
(A bowl of Dokdo's red seaperch and vegetables)

1032
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:53,223
(Fresh cold sashimi caught in the sea by Ulleung Island)

1033
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:55,322
We also served you steamed conch.

1034
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:57,483
(Jong Min won steamed conch that's full of sea scent.)

1035
00:35:58,093 --> 00:36:01,962
(The ultimate chewy texture)

1036
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:03,662
There are many conches.

1037
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:05,172
- Share with us.
- Then you can share them with us.

1038
00:36:05,173 --> 00:36:06,232
I'm sorry.

1039
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:07,842
Then I won't give you any chopsticks.

1040
00:36:07,843 --> 00:36:09,202
- We won't share our food with you.
- No.

1041
00:36:09,203 --> 00:36:10,472
Why not?

1042
00:36:10,473 --> 00:36:12,773
I won't let you eat anymore.

1043
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:15,482
Jong Min, that dish is for you.

1044
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:16,582
You cannot share it with others.

1045
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:17,713
Really? I can't?

1046
00:36:18,183 --> 00:36:20,013
(That's even better.)

1047
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:21,683
Then eat them all.

1048
00:36:22,353 --> 00:36:24,329
- Eat the shells too.
- Don't leave any leftovers.

1049
00:36:24,353 --> 00:36:25,693
The shell is part of the conch.

1050
00:36:26,293 --> 00:36:28,423
- Enjoy your food.
- Gosh, thank you.

1051
00:36:28,723 --> 00:36:31,192
There's a way to enjoy the cold sashimi soup.

1052
00:36:31,193 --> 00:36:32,393
I'll explain it briefly.

1053
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:36,362
Add a big spoonful of gochujang to the cold sashimi soup.

1054
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:38,103
Mix them with a spoon for over two minutes.

1055
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:39,602
Over two minutes?

1056
00:36:39,603 --> 00:36:41,602
You have to mix them for over two minutes...

1057
00:36:41,603 --> 00:36:44,373
for the juice to come out from the vegetables, making it better.

1058
00:36:45,213 --> 00:36:46,573
Suddenly, it's clumping together.

1059
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:51,852
(Applying the seasoning to crunchy vegetables)

1060
00:36:51,853 --> 00:36:54,083
We should eat half of it on the rice?

1061
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:55,283
This is healthy.

1062
00:36:57,323 --> 00:36:58,323
(Plentiful)

1063
00:36:58,323 --> 00:36:59,323
This is...

1064
00:37:01,563 --> 00:37:04,993
(Taking a big bite)

1065
00:37:08,163 --> 00:37:10,733
(Jong Min also tries a spoonful.)

1066
00:37:12,103 --> 00:37:13,432
It has the scent of the sea.

1067
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:16,843
(Sweet and sour cold sashimi soup spreads over the palate.)

1068
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:20,642
(A pleasant moment for the eyes and the mouth)

1069
00:37:20,643 --> 00:37:21,643
(Humming)

1070
00:37:21,644 --> 00:37:22,682
Gosh, it's good.

1071
00:37:22,683 --> 00:37:24,563
It tastes like sashimi bibimbap with gochujang.

1072
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:28,193
Juice has to come out from the vegetables.

1073
00:37:28,283 --> 00:37:29,952
- It became slightly sweet.
- It's sweet.

1074
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:32,593
The oil in the gochujang makes it savory.

1075
00:37:32,993 --> 00:37:34,863
It's savory, sweet, and tangy.

1076
00:37:35,323 --> 00:37:36,462
- This?
- No.

1077
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:40,063
(He can't stop eating.)

1078
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:41,662
- Should I pour it in?
- Yes.

1079
00:37:41,663 --> 00:37:42,903
- All of it?
- All of it.

1080
00:37:43,563 --> 00:37:45,432
(2. Leave half of it and add broth and thin noodles)

1081
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:46,473
All right.

1082
00:37:46,673 --> 00:37:47,702
Thin noodles.

1083
00:37:47,703 --> 00:37:49,073
It's also good with thin noodles.

1084
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:51,112
It looks so delicious.

1085
00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:52,713
(Noodles soaked with a lot of broth)

1086
00:37:54,543 --> 00:37:56,943
(Se Yoon scoops up a lot of thin noodles and eats.)

1087
00:38:00,983 --> 00:38:02,082
- It's refreshing.
- It's amazing.

1088
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,083
It's refreshing.

1089
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:04,522
The taste is just right.

1090
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:05,523
I don't need any beverage.

1091
00:38:05,524 --> 00:38:06,952
- I agree.
- When you savor it...

1092
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:07,962
(Refreshing broth with the right amount of sweetness)

1093
00:38:07,963 --> 00:38:10,463
I'll mix the remaining rice in it.

1094
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:16,503
(3. Mix it with the leftover rice and finish it off)

1095
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:20,742
It tastes really good with rice.

1096
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:22,543
Yes. It tastes excellent with rice.

1097
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,573
(Slurping)

1098
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:29,683
(You always have to finish it with rice.)

1099
00:38:31,513 --> 00:38:32,683
The view is beautiful too.

1100
00:38:34,623 --> 00:38:35,743
This is the best restaurant.

1101
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:37,792
It deserves that title.

1102
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:40,492
(The one and only restaurant created by the nature on Ulleung Island)

1103
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:42,063
- Is this how we ate it?
- No.

1104
00:38:43,463 --> 00:38:44,493
(Humming)

1105
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:47,433
(Turning)

1106
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:50,563
(What is he doing all of a sudden?)

1107
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:53,533
(DinDin won Coke during a side game.)

1108
00:38:54,803 --> 00:38:56,042
(Bragging about winning Coke exclusively)

1109
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:57,043
This is it.

1110
00:38:58,413 --> 00:39:00,042
Gosh, this is it.

1111
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:01,343
Can I share these with him?

1112
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:03,412
(Jong Min tries to barter with him.)

1113
00:39:03,413 --> 00:39:04,713
- You want one?
- Sure.

1114
00:39:05,353 --> 00:39:07,453
- I'll give you a sip in return.
- Okay.

1115
00:39:07,623 --> 00:39:08,983
This one is obviously the biggest.

1116
00:39:09,453 --> 00:39:10,823
- Okay.
- Leave it here.

1117
00:39:13,193 --> 00:39:14,492
- One sip.
- You only get one.

1118
00:39:14,493 --> 00:39:15,563
(Smiling)

1119
00:39:16,893 --> 00:39:18,132
You're so greedy.

1120
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:19,133
(Full of greed)

1121
00:39:19,663 --> 00:39:21,733
(He spilled everything.)

1122
00:39:22,003 --> 00:39:24,303
(I knew it.)

1123
00:39:24,373 --> 00:39:25,632
You're unbelievable.

1124
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:27,703
- Why are you so greedy?
- That was refreshing.

1125
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:30,502
I knew that it'd happen.

1126
00:39:30,503 --> 00:39:31,543
(The result of his greed)

1127
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:34,513
- Were these really caught today?
- Yes.

1128
00:39:35,983 --> 00:39:37,423
Yes, it was definitely caught today.

1129
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:42,153
(Fresh and taut murex)

1130
00:39:42,553 --> 00:39:43,683
Can you give me one?

1131
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:45,853
(Desperate)

1132
00:39:46,023 --> 00:39:47,493
I'm sorry. I'd love to.

1133
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:49,993
(It looks so good.)

1134
00:39:50,193 --> 00:39:51,563
(In that case...)

1135
00:39:51,663 --> 00:39:52,693
Seagulls.

1136
00:39:53,633 --> 00:39:55,903
Could you throw me a murex too?

1137
00:39:56,403 --> 00:39:57,633
Please take pity on me.

1138
00:39:57,933 --> 00:39:59,333
(What?)

1139
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,773
- What?
- Thank you.

1140
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:05,842
What?

1141
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:07,512
(Confused)

1142
00:40:07,513 --> 00:40:08,543
What happened?

1143
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:10,983
This is amazing. The seagull...

1144
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:12,213
(Exclaiming)

1145
00:40:13,213 --> 00:40:15,483
This is crazy. A seagull gave it to me.

1146
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:16,852
- What?
- This is crazy.

1147
00:40:16,853 --> 00:40:18,423
(Dumbfounded)

1148
00:40:18,553 --> 00:40:19,722
I have all of mine.

1149
00:40:19,723 --> 00:40:21,693
(This is the right number.)

1150
00:40:23,623 --> 00:40:25,533
The last rule on 2 Days 1 Night.

1151
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:28,503
Never close your eyes when you barter.

1152
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:31,933
You're so greedy.

1153
00:40:31,934 --> 00:40:34,033
(Moon Se Yoon's hand is faster than the eyes.)

1154
00:40:34,503 --> 00:40:35,873
(Quickly)

1155
00:40:36,873 --> 00:40:38,513
(Feeling proud)

1156
00:40:39,113 --> 00:40:40,343
Aren't you a gangster?

1157
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:41,743
(Laughing)

1158
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:43,812
He's a gangster.

1159
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:46,313
(All that matters is that it tastes good.)

1160
00:40:46,783 --> 00:40:48,252
- As it's been a while, - It's crunchy.

1161
00:40:48,253 --> 00:40:50,183
- it's nice and tasty.
- It's crunchy.

1162
00:40:50,923 --> 00:40:53,793
Once you're done with your meal, let's join the other members.

1163
00:40:53,923 --> 00:40:55,363
- Okay.
- Okay.

1164
00:40:55,563 --> 00:40:58,562
(Team Up arrived at a restaurant in the mountain.)

1165
00:40:58,563 --> 00:40:59,663
What's this?

1166
00:41:00,763 --> 00:41:02,833
Is it bibimbap in a brass bowl?

1167
00:41:03,163 --> 00:41:04,802
- My, it's nice.
- I see pumpkin sikhye.

1168
00:41:04,803 --> 00:41:05,803
(Amazed)

1169
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:07,572
- This is so nice.
- There's seasoned deodeok too.

1170
00:41:07,573 --> 00:41:09,443
- Isn't this crazy good?
- It's so great.

1171
00:41:09,773 --> 00:41:10,812
This is crazy good.

1172
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:14,482
The dish that Seon Ho is looking at is seasoned goat's beard.

1173
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:15,483
(You can have seasoned goat's beard only on Ulleung Island.)

1174
00:41:15,484 --> 00:41:17,383
- Is this goat's beard?
- Goat's beard...

1175
00:41:17,653 --> 00:41:20,752
tastes like beef, ginseng, and fatsia shoots at the same time.

1176
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:22,399
(You can enjoy the tastes of beef, ginseng, and fatsia shoots at once.)

1177
00:41:22,423 --> 00:41:23,882
The one in front of you is seasoned deodeok.

1178
00:41:23,883 --> 00:41:25,869
(Seasoned deodeok, the perfect harmony of crispness and sourness)

1179
00:41:25,893 --> 00:41:28,092
You will also have acorn jelly and mung bean bindaetteok.

1180
00:41:28,093 --> 00:41:29,439
(Mung bean bindaetteok, acorn jelly)

1181
00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:30,463
And pumpkin sikhye.

1182
00:41:30,464 --> 00:41:33,092
Yes, this is pumpkin sikhye, the specialty of Ulleung Island.

1183
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:34,902
(And even pumpkin sikhye, the specialty of Ulleung Island)

1184
00:41:34,903 --> 00:41:36,602
Among all meals we've had on 2 Days 1 Night,

1185
00:41:36,603 --> 00:41:38,573
I think this has the best combination of dishes.

1186
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:40,149
- Oh, my. But...
- Can you give me a spoon?

1187
00:41:40,173 --> 00:41:44,212
We expected some food that we usually grill or stir-fry.

1188
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:46,513
- Yes?
- I mean, some kind of meat.

1189
00:41:47,013 --> 00:41:48,442
We don't get any meat.

1190
00:41:48,443 --> 00:41:49,782
- These dishes...
- But that one tastes like meat.

1191
00:41:49,783 --> 00:41:50,783
- Does it?
- Yes.

1192
00:41:50,784 --> 00:41:52,212
Chicken soup with sarcodon mushroom, for example.

1193
00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:53,682
I also expected to have a dish like that.

1194
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:55,259
This is why they say that greed is never-ending.

1195
00:41:55,283 --> 00:41:56,452
They're complaining when we have so much food here.

1196
00:41:56,453 --> 00:41:59,022
- You said we'd have five dishes.
- Yes.

1197
00:41:59,023 --> 00:42:00,023
Let's check.

1198
00:42:00,024 --> 00:42:01,362
- One, two, three, four...
- The seasoned vegetable and...

1199
00:42:01,363 --> 00:42:02,523
And there's pumpkin sikhye.

1200
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,032
Oh, including pumpkin sikhye? Thank you.

1201
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:06,362
May I try a sip of the sikhye?

1202
00:42:06,363 --> 00:42:07,932
- Sure.
- This is definitely my favorite.

1203
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:10,033
This is crazy good. I love it.

1204
00:42:11,203 --> 00:42:12,732
It relieves stress.

1205
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:13,733
Oh, my. This is so good.

1206
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:14,979
(With thin ice, it gets rid of the tiredness after hiking.)

1207
00:42:15,003 --> 00:42:16,302
This sikhye is really good.

1208
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:17,303
(I'll try a sip too.)

1209
00:42:17,304 --> 00:42:19,013
This is what I want from 2 Days 1 Night.

1210
00:42:19,143 --> 00:42:20,812
I'm sorry for complaining. This is so delicious.

1211
00:42:20,813 --> 00:42:22,819
(After tasting it, he stops complaining about the food.)

1212
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:26,053
This is a popular place that locals recommend.

1213
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:29,022
- What is this? This is amazing.
- Yes.

1214
00:42:29,023 --> 00:42:30,459
I'd be happy even if I drink only this sikhye.

1215
00:42:30,483 --> 00:42:31,492
This is crazy good.

1216
00:42:31,493 --> 00:42:32,969
(Joon fell in love with the pumpkin sikhye.)

1217
00:42:32,993 --> 00:42:34,893
The restaurant owner made it by himself.

1218
00:42:35,593 --> 00:42:36,862
- Oh, my. I'll try it.
- Okay.

1219
00:42:36,863 --> 00:42:38,132
- Isn't it amazing?
- It's so good.

1220
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:40,432
- When I saw this from afar, - Yes.

1221
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:43,103
It looked like meat in jangjorim.

1222
00:42:43,503 --> 00:42:45,032
I thought it was beef that was torn in strips.

1223
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:47,273
- It's really...
- My, the fresh scent of a mountain.

1224
00:42:47,803 --> 00:42:49,003
It's chewy and nice.

1225
00:42:50,703 --> 00:42:52,073
- You're lying.
- Try it.

1226
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,613
(Having a doubt)

1227
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,895
- It must be refreshing.
- I tried it for the first time.

1228
00:42:57,543 --> 00:42:58,612
It's not bad, right?

1229
00:42:58,613 --> 00:42:59,953
(My gosh. This is really good.)

1230
00:43:00,283 --> 00:43:02,322
- It has a texture of meat.
- It does have a texture of meat.

1231
00:43:02,323 --> 00:43:03,622
(It's hard to believe, but it feels like meat.)

1232
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,952
- Nice. And the seasoned deodeok...
- I like deodeok.

1233
00:43:05,953 --> 00:43:07,523
- Deodeok... Hey, be careful.
- Thanks.

1234
00:43:09,023 --> 00:43:10,023
(Exclaiming)

1235
00:43:10,293 --> 00:43:11,293
My, this is good.

1236
00:43:11,294 --> 00:43:12,739
(The taste of it makes you exclaim in awe.)

1237
00:43:12,763 --> 00:43:15,363
Because Ulleung Island is a volcanic island,

1238
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:17,232
deodeok is unusually crispy.

1239
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:19,873
(The crispy, bitter taste makes Ulleung Island's deodeok special.)

1240
00:43:19,903 --> 00:43:21,242
Ulleung Island's deodeok is unusual in a nice way, right?

1241
00:43:21,243 --> 00:43:22,372
- It's so tasty.
- Indeed.

1242
00:43:22,373 --> 00:43:23,603
(Satisfied)

1243
00:43:23,873 --> 00:43:26,813
It has a different texture from the deodeok we usually have.

1244
00:43:27,073 --> 00:43:28,813
- It's crispier.
- Exactly.

1245
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:32,013
The acorn jelly is so plump, bouncy,

1246
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:33,583
and chewy. It's tasty.

1247
00:43:33,584 --> 00:43:35,504
(The scent of mountain spreads in their mouths.)

1248
00:43:36,023 --> 00:43:37,182
This acorn jelly is also so good.

1249
00:43:37,183 --> 00:43:38,999
(The nutty, aromatic, and clean taste fills the mouth.)

1250
00:43:39,023 --> 00:43:41,623
I guess we really did a great job.

1251
00:43:42,063 --> 00:43:43,639
They must've thought it'd be very difficult for us.

1252
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,862
I haven't had a normal meal on this show in a long while.

1253
00:43:45,863 --> 00:43:47,103
- Exactly. Me neither.
- Right.

1254
00:43:49,063 --> 00:43:51,673
When people make bibimbap in here, what do they put in?

1255
00:43:52,373 --> 00:43:56,173
I heard it was good with goat's beard and deodeok.

1256
00:43:56,643 --> 00:43:57,643
Okay. I'll try it.

1257
00:43:57,644 --> 00:44:00,643
This is my first time trying this dish.

1258
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:02,313
It's amazing.

1259
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:03,942
It has such an interesting texture.

1260
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:05,152
Isn't this one fascinating?

1261
00:44:05,153 --> 00:44:06,353
It has an interesting texture.

1262
00:44:07,183 --> 00:44:08,582
Oh, my. I really love this one.

1263
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:10,629
(Adding nutty sesame oil, the key ingredient of bibimbap)

1264
00:44:10,653 --> 00:44:11,722
My, it looks so tasty.

1265
00:44:11,723 --> 00:44:12,852
(Ulleung Island-style bibimbap with various flavors is done.)

1266
00:44:12,853 --> 00:44:13,993
- I'll try it.
- Okay.

1267
00:44:14,293 --> 00:44:15,323
It looks good.

1268
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:17,192
You're enjoying it properly.

1269
00:44:17,193 --> 00:44:19,033
(Rolling his eyes)

1270
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:25,333
(Giggling)

1271
00:44:25,973 --> 00:44:28,373
You'll regret it if you don't try it. Just try one bite.

1272
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,142
- For the rest of my life?
- You'll regret it so much.

1273
00:44:30,143 --> 00:44:32,312
- Can I have one bite?
- Give me a second.

1274
00:44:32,313 --> 00:44:34,272
(Is it that good?)

1275
00:44:34,273 --> 00:44:35,543
- Try it.
- Hold on.

1276
00:44:35,713 --> 00:44:37,483
- Thank you.
- Put it all in your mouth.

1277
00:44:43,523 --> 00:44:45,352
(Choking)

1278
00:44:45,353 --> 00:44:47,352
You may think it's too much for one bite,

1279
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:50,222
but once you start chewing the food,

1280
00:44:50,223 --> 00:44:51,262
(You can enjoy the flavor properly when you have a big bite.)

1281
00:44:51,263 --> 00:44:53,503
you can taste the deodeok and goat's beard all together.

1282
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:54,933
Oh, my. This is...

1283
00:44:55,463 --> 00:44:57,063
I do feel the taste of the mountain.

1284
00:44:58,503 --> 00:44:59,602
- This is really good.
- Yes.

1285
00:44:59,603 --> 00:45:01,043
- It fills your mouth, right?
- Yes.

1286
00:45:01,603 --> 00:45:02,802
(My dear Seon Ho, you should have a bite too.)

1287
00:45:02,803 --> 00:45:05,243
It tastes even better since we're eating outside.

1288
00:45:07,013 --> 00:45:08,493
You'll regret it if you don't eat it.

1289
00:45:11,283 --> 00:45:12,652
It tastes different from regular bibimbap.

1290
00:45:12,653 --> 00:45:14,213
- It's totally different, right?
- Yes.

1291
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:16,952
(He already finished pumpkin sikhye.)

1292
00:45:16,953 --> 00:45:18,393
Can I have some more pumpkin sikhye?

1293
00:45:19,193 --> 00:45:20,322
- Can I...
- Would you like some more?

1294
00:45:20,323 --> 00:45:21,622
- Yes, please.
- Me too.

1295
00:45:21,623 --> 00:45:23,662
It's so good. Why did you ask for it when you still have some left?

1296
00:45:23,663 --> 00:45:25,392
Because it's good. I was saving it.

1297
00:45:25,393 --> 00:45:26,493
- I see.
- How about we...

1298
00:45:27,133 --> 00:45:29,633
- play a simple quiz game...
- Yes?

1299
00:45:30,563 --> 00:45:33,172
- with pumpkin sikhye on the line?
- Okay.

1300
00:45:33,173 --> 00:45:34,442
- Okay.
- How much will you give us?

1301
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:38,442
- It's about Ulleung Island.
- Okay.

1302
00:45:38,443 --> 00:45:40,273
There are three correct answers.

1303
00:45:40,973 --> 00:45:43,743
We'll give the winner a large amount of pumpkin sikhye.

1304
00:45:43,983 --> 00:45:46,312
- Okay. I'll win. I'll do well.
- Okay.

1305
00:45:46,313 --> 00:45:47,453
(Blazing enthusiasm)

1306
00:45:47,923 --> 00:45:51,622
Ulleung Island is known to have 5 things and not to have 3 things.

1307
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,153
- Five things?
- It has five things.

1308
00:45:53,353 --> 00:45:54,939
- And it doesn't have three things.
- Got it.

1309
00:45:54,963 --> 00:45:58,532
There are a lot of juniper trees, beautiful women,

1310
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:01,133
wind, water, and rocks...

1311
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,063
on Ulleung Island.

1312
00:46:04,233 --> 00:46:07,572
What are the three things that are not on Ulleung Island?

1313
00:46:07,573 --> 00:46:09,619
(What are the 3 things that are not on Ulleung Island?)

1314
00:46:09,643 --> 00:46:10,643
- Joon.
- Go ahead.

1315
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:12,443
- Should we say all three answers?
- Yes.

1316
00:46:13,013 --> 00:46:14,113
Snakes.

1317
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:16,543
Thieves.

1318
00:46:16,544 --> 00:46:19,152
(Snakes, thieves)

1319
00:46:19,153 --> 00:46:20,153
And rats.

1320
00:46:21,683 --> 00:46:23,383
Joon, your answer is incorrect.

1321
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,392
Shall I tell you how many of them are correct answers?

1322
00:46:25,393 --> 00:46:26,713
- Yes, please.
- I got two right.

1323
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:28,792
- That's correct.
- I came here yesterday.

1324
00:46:28,793 --> 00:46:30,492
So I'm half a local here.

1325
00:46:30,493 --> 00:46:31,593
- Oh, my.
- Yes.

1326
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:34,233
That's why I know the answers. Had I come today, I wouldn't know.

1327
00:46:34,393 --> 00:46:35,463
- Seon Ho.
- Go ahead.

1328
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:37,063
- Snakes, - Yes.

1329
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:38,973
Thieves, and wild animals.

1330
00:46:39,803 --> 00:46:41,103
- Wild animals?
- Yes.

1331
00:46:41,303 --> 00:46:43,203
- I don't think that's correct.
- Incorrect.

1332
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:46,372
- Snakes, thieves, - Yes. Correct.

1333
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:47,773
And greed.

1334
00:46:48,383 --> 00:46:50,263
- Incorrect. Do you want a hint?
- Yes, please.

1335
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:51,653
The sky.

1336
00:46:51,953 --> 00:46:53,453
- Joon.
- Joon, go ahead.

1337
00:46:53,753 --> 00:46:55,123
Snakes, thieves, and airplanes.

1338
00:46:56,723 --> 00:46:57,893
("V" for victory)

1339
00:46:59,453 --> 00:47:00,852
- Incorrect.
- Why?

1340
00:47:00,853 --> 00:47:01,962
There are no airplanes here.

1341
00:47:01,963 --> 00:47:03,022
There has been none of this on the island since the past...

1342
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:04,792
- before airplanes were invented.
- Since the past?

1343
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:06,563
The Wright brothers lived in the past.

1344
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:08,213
They lived a very long time ago.

1345
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:10,262
While we were walking here,

1346
00:47:10,263 --> 00:47:12,003
we all said that this was so good.

1347
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:14,473
Yes, we said the air was clear.

1348
00:47:15,703 --> 00:47:17,673
- Sae Ho.
- Go ahead.

1349
00:47:17,873 --> 00:47:19,042
Snakes, thieves, and pollution.

1350
00:47:19,043 --> 00:47:20,472
(Snakes, thieves, pollution)

1351
00:47:20,473 --> 00:47:22,112
- Correct.
- Okay.

1352
00:47:22,113 --> 00:47:24,012
Shall I enjoy drinking up the sikhye?

1353
00:47:24,013 --> 00:47:26,383
(Sae Ho gained pumpkin sikhye.)

1354
00:47:26,953 --> 00:47:29,883
(As the island of peace, there are no thieves and pollution.)

1355
00:47:30,253 --> 00:47:33,693
(And unusually, there are no snakes on Ulleung Island.)

1356
00:47:34,253 --> 00:47:36,062
(Rumor has it that juniper trees drive snakes away, )

1357
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:37,933
(but it's still a mystery.)

1358
00:47:39,293 --> 00:47:41,902
(Every moment on Ulleung Island is special and precious.)

1359
00:47:41,903 --> 00:47:43,143
We can hear the birds chirping.

1360
00:47:43,633 --> 00:47:45,673
The food is good. Everything here makes me happy.

1361
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:47,942
I love the scent of the mountain.

1362
00:47:47,943 --> 00:47:49,272
(The scent of Ulleung Island spread in my mouth.)

1363
00:47:49,273 --> 00:47:50,879
(It wasn't fancy, but it will remain in my memory for a long time.)

1364
00:47:50,903 --> 00:47:52,272
(Hakpo Port, Bongnae Waterfall, Tonggumi Fishing Port)

1365
00:47:52,273 --> 00:47:53,489
Are we going in the right direction?

1366
00:47:53,513 --> 00:47:55,413
Did we come this way before? Oh, we did.

1367
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,953
The tourists must be excited. The weather is perfect.

1368
00:47:58,013 --> 00:47:59,013
Of course.

1369
00:47:59,113 --> 00:48:00,712
- It's perfect for some water fun.
- And the breeze is cool.

1370
00:48:00,713 --> 00:48:02,222
(They're on their way to meet their friends again.)

1371
00:48:02,223 --> 00:48:04,183
- It's beautiful.
- It's a bit scary though.

1372
00:48:05,053 --> 00:48:06,552
There are so many blennies on the island.

1373
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:08,599
- Yes. You can catch them so easily.
- I was surprised.

1374
00:48:08,623 --> 00:48:09,723
It's so fascinating.

1375
00:48:10,823 --> 00:48:11,993
How is that possible?

1376
00:48:12,763 --> 00:48:14,802
What's funnier is that you can't see any of them.

1377
00:48:14,803 --> 00:48:15,863
Exactly.

1378
00:48:16,763 --> 00:48:18,073
I caught two of them at once.

1379
00:48:18,673 --> 00:48:21,803
(There were a lot of blennies, but they were hiding under rocks.)

1380
00:48:22,503 --> 00:48:25,043
I think the other team harvested victory onion.

1381
00:48:25,813 --> 00:48:27,642
You have to go to a mountain to pick victory onion, right?

1382
00:48:27,643 --> 00:48:29,183
- Yes.
- Then I guess you're right.

1383
00:48:29,643 --> 00:48:31,289
Ulleung Island is famous for victory onion.

1384
00:48:31,313 --> 00:48:32,782
We had cold sashimi soup.

1385
00:48:32,783 --> 00:48:34,783
What do you think they had with victory onion?

1386
00:48:35,053 --> 00:48:37,183
- Meat?
- No way.

1387
00:48:37,823 --> 00:48:38,853
It smells different.

1388
00:48:39,653 --> 00:48:40,793
I don't smell dust at all.

1389
00:48:41,493 --> 00:48:43,063
Roll down the window, Joon.

1390
00:48:44,523 --> 00:48:45,693
Did you feel this yesterday?

1391
00:48:46,263 --> 00:48:49,433
Nice. It feels the same way I felt yesterday.

1392
00:48:50,363 --> 00:48:52,302
- Hey, what were those things...
- Yes?

1393
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:54,402
That aren't on this island? Thieves,

1394
00:48:54,403 --> 00:48:55,642
- Thieves, snakes, - pollution,

1395
00:48:55,643 --> 00:48:56,779
- and pollution.
- and snakes.

1396
00:48:56,803 --> 00:48:59,173
I can see that there's no pollution on the island.

1397
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:01,112
Exactly. Isn't the air sweet here?

1398
00:49:01,113 --> 00:49:02,212
Oh, my. It's really refreshing.

1399
00:49:02,213 --> 00:49:04,089
- The air is different here.
- It feels delicious to the lungs.

1400
00:49:04,113 --> 00:49:05,312
You can see it as soon as we go down the mountain.

1401
00:49:05,313 --> 00:49:07,282
The sea looks magnificent from this downhill road.

1402
00:49:07,283 --> 00:49:08,283
Exactly.

1403
00:49:09,253 --> 00:49:10,422
The mountain is beautiful.

1404
00:49:10,423 --> 00:49:11,852
I thought it was the sea that made the island beautiful,

1405
00:49:11,853 --> 00:49:14,152
but the mountains are beautiful on Ulleung Island.

1406
00:49:14,153 --> 00:49:15,293
I didn't expect that.

1407
00:49:15,793 --> 00:49:17,699
Most people think of the sea when they hear Ulleung Island.

1408
00:49:17,723 --> 00:49:19,392
- I was one of them.
- Exactly.

1409
00:49:19,393 --> 00:49:21,832
But when I saw the mountains, I was amazed.

1410
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,779
The place we just visited was really beautiful too.

1411
00:49:23,803 --> 00:49:24,903
- I agree.
- Right.

1412
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,133
Is there any song about Ulleung Island?

1413
00:49:27,473 --> 00:49:28,572
- Yes, there is.
- Ulleung Island

1414
00:49:28,573 --> 00:49:29,602
(He starts singing the song automatically.)

1415
00:49:29,603 --> 00:49:31,513
- That's "Dokdo Is Our Land."
- Oh, right.

1416
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:33,172
Is there a song that talks about Ulleung Island?

1417
00:49:33,173 --> 00:49:34,213
(Then what song is there?)

1418
00:49:34,343 --> 00:49:35,482
I'll play the song.

1419
00:49:35,483 --> 00:49:37,742
(A melody comes out of Sae Ho's phone.)

1420
00:49:37,743 --> 00:49:39,613
Oh, right. I forgot about this song. Yes.

1421
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:41,522
Isn't this a really old song?

1422
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:43,883
(It's an unfamiliar song for Seon Ho who was born in 2002.)

1423
00:49:44,553 --> 00:49:46,953
(Singing along)

1424
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:50,162
(Sae Ho chose "Ulleung Island Twist" by Lee Sisters.)

1425
00:49:50,163 --> 00:49:52,033
I haven't heard this song in a very long time.

1426
00:49:53,793 --> 00:49:56,233
(The perfect song to listen to while enjoying the scenery)

1427
00:49:57,003 --> 00:49:59,533
(The clear, pleasant harmony resonates across Ulleung Island.)

1428
00:50:00,803 --> 00:50:01,803
(Pumpkin malt candy)

1429
00:50:02,473 --> 00:50:04,342
- Right. "Pumpkin malt candy."
- "Pumpkin malt candy."

1430
00:50:04,343 --> 00:50:05,873
(The catchy, cute lyrics)

1431
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:08,413
Old songs are very lovely.

1432
00:50:08,613 --> 00:50:09,982
- Indeed.
- It's so lovely.

1433
00:50:09,983 --> 00:50:11,712
- And the lyrics are romantic.
- Yes.

1434
00:50:11,713 --> 00:50:13,313
(The members are in love with the song.)

1435
00:50:13,383 --> 00:50:16,083
I have a feeling that we'll get a question about this song.

1436
00:50:17,323 --> 00:50:18,323
At least once.

1437
00:50:18,823 --> 00:50:21,093
A question about the lyrics of this song.

1438
00:50:21,593 --> 00:50:24,192
There will be a question about a song about Ulleung Island, right?

1439
00:50:24,193 --> 00:50:25,193
(They're sure that there will be a song mission.)

1440
00:50:25,194 --> 00:50:28,703
- Sure. A song about Ulleung Island.
- I'll sing the song for you.

1441
00:50:28,863 --> 00:50:29,903
Okay.

1442
00:50:29,963 --> 00:50:32,773
(Team Up starts studying properly.)

1443
00:50:33,473 --> 00:50:35,703
(Sae Ho's singing class begins.)

1444
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:39,143
(Listening carefully)

1445
00:50:39,513 --> 00:50:41,342
(Ulleung Island is beautiful)

1446
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:42,483
It's simple.

1447
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:48,953
(Could their guess be right?)

1448
00:50:50,283 --> 00:50:54,593
(While singing the song, they arrive at the next location.)

1449
00:50:55,323 --> 00:50:57,292
The water seems so clean.

1450
00:50:57,293 --> 00:50:58,862
- I want to dive in.
- Me too.

1451
00:50:58,863 --> 00:50:59,863
(The six friends gathered after a long time.)

1452
00:50:59,864 --> 00:51:01,162
- I'm amazed. Sae Ho, - Can you feel it?

1453
00:51:01,163 --> 00:51:02,433
Look at the color of the water.

1454
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:03,643
You have to check this out.

1455
00:51:03,703 --> 00:51:04,703
Shall I take a look?

1456
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:06,749
- Look at the color of the water.
- Goodness.

1457
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:07,903
It's your first time here.

1458
00:51:09,273 --> 00:51:10,402
You can see all the way to the bottom of the sea.

1459
00:51:10,403 --> 00:51:12,172
The color of the water is so pretty.

1460
00:51:12,173 --> 00:51:13,572
- I want to get in.
- It's so pretty.

1461
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:16,843
(The color of the sea is so clear that you can see all the way down.)

1462
00:51:17,383 --> 00:51:21,113
(This spot is famous for diving and snorkeling too.)

1463
00:51:21,353 --> 00:51:24,823
This is Ulleung Island's only natural harbor.

1464
00:51:25,223 --> 00:51:27,622
- It's Tonggumi Fishing Port.
- Tonggumi Fishing Port.

1465
00:51:27,623 --> 00:51:28,762
- Right.
- Tonggumi.

1466
00:51:28,763 --> 00:51:30,292
The name of the village is Tonggumi.

1467
00:51:30,293 --> 00:51:32,562
They started calling the place that because the valleys...

1468
00:51:32,563 --> 00:51:35,703
on both sides are deep and narrow like a fishing trap.

1469
00:51:36,233 --> 00:51:38,472
Also, some say that the turtle-shaped rock...

1470
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:41,202
looks like it's going inside the village,

1471
00:51:41,203 --> 00:51:43,173
hence the name.

1472
00:51:44,373 --> 00:51:45,813
It's so cool, look behind.

1473
00:51:46,313 --> 00:51:47,943
This is a famous spot.

1474
00:51:47,973 --> 00:51:48,982
(This is a painting painted by nature, not humans.)

1475
00:51:48,983 --> 00:51:50,212
I want to swim here.

1476
00:51:50,213 --> 00:51:51,612
It's great scenery.

1477
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:53,413
- It's great scenery indeed.
- Right.

1478
00:51:53,953 --> 00:51:55,523
The next place we're going...

1479
00:51:55,783 --> 00:51:57,382
It's located a bit higher than where we are.

1480
00:51:57,383 --> 00:51:58,952
- Are we climbing up again?
- What's happening?

1481
00:51:58,953 --> 00:52:00,713
But we just got down. Are we going up again?

1482
00:52:02,063 --> 00:52:03,769
You will have a different mode of transportation...

1483
00:52:03,793 --> 00:52:05,362
depending on the result of your missions.

1484
00:52:05,363 --> 00:52:06,532
(They will have different modes of transportation.)

1485
00:52:06,533 --> 00:52:08,053
Let's hear the mode of transportation.

1486
00:52:08,203 --> 00:52:12,032
You can go up there by a cable car if you clear the mission.

1487
00:52:12,033 --> 00:52:13,872
- We have a cable car?
- If you fail to clear it,

1488
00:52:13,873 --> 00:52:16,242
you have to walk up with your legs.

1489
00:52:16,243 --> 00:52:17,572
(They have to walk up 30 minutes if they fail the mission.)

1490
00:52:17,573 --> 00:52:19,743
It must be very high if we have to get on a cable car.

1491
00:52:19,843 --> 00:52:22,082
- A cable car...
- We're here near the sea!

1492
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,912
Why do we have to climb up the mountains?

1493
00:52:23,913 --> 00:52:25,413
We're right next to the sea.

1494
00:52:25,483 --> 00:52:27,852
Your mode of transportation will be decided by your mission's results.

1495
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,822
It's called Toy Hammer Karaoke.

1496
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,053
- Toy Hammer Karaoke?
- Yes.

1497
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:33,793
- It's Toy Hammer Karaoke.
- Yes!

1498
00:52:33,953 --> 00:52:35,722
(They're getting excited.)

1499
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:36,762
It has been a while since we played this.

1500
00:52:36,763 --> 00:52:38,843
(The long-lost karaoke mission has made a comeback.)

1501
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,532
We'll have toy hammers on top of our heads.

1502
00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:44,039
(They're playing with toy hammers instead of the old versions.)

1503
00:52:44,063 --> 00:52:45,303
You sound like old people.

1504
00:52:46,273 --> 00:52:47,553
Here's the song for the mission.

1505
00:52:48,133 --> 00:52:50,642
Don't tell me the song is "Ulleung Island Twist."

1506
00:52:50,643 --> 00:52:52,112
We listened to the song the entire journey here.

1507
00:52:52,113 --> 00:52:53,413
Right, it must be that.

1508
00:52:53,543 --> 00:52:54,882
I don't know the lyrics.

1509
00:52:54,883 --> 00:52:57,013
(Is "Ulleung Island Twist" really the mission song?)

1510
00:52:57,313 --> 00:52:59,182
- The song for the mission is...
- It has to be a song I know...

1511
00:52:59,183 --> 00:53:00,489
(Today's song for Toy Hammer Karaoke is...)

1512
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:02,753
- It's "Ulleung Island Twist."
- Goodness.

1513
00:53:02,853 --> 00:53:04,022
It's "Ulleung Island Twist."

1514
00:53:04,023 --> 00:53:05,223
(Goodness)

1515
00:53:05,723 --> 00:53:07,223
(Really?)

1516
00:53:07,293 --> 00:53:09,162
We studied the lyrics during our journey.

1517
00:53:09,163 --> 00:53:10,462
- Goodness.
- Really?

1518
00:53:10,463 --> 00:53:11,862
(Today's mission song)

1519
00:53:11,863 --> 00:53:12,893
No way.

1520
00:53:13,293 --> 00:53:15,532
(It's a must-listen song when we talk about this place.)

1521
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:18,602
("Ulleung Island Twist" by Lee Sisters)

1522
00:53:18,603 --> 00:53:22,643
(This is the mission song.)

1523
00:53:23,103 --> 00:53:24,103
(A few minutes ago in the van)

1524
00:53:24,104 --> 00:53:26,104
It has been so long since I listened to this song.

1525
00:53:26,243 --> 00:53:28,882
I feel like it could be the song for our mission or something.

1526
00:53:28,883 --> 00:53:30,212
(They thought that this song could be the song for the mission.)

1527
00:53:30,213 --> 00:53:31,773
They will play this song at least once.

1528
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:33,582
I should have memorized the lyrics.

1529
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:34,813
You sang the song.

1530
00:53:34,853 --> 00:53:36,823
- I know this.
- We all know.

1531
00:53:36,883 --> 00:53:37,922
- I know this song.
- Are we playing this song?

1532
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,652
- Just the first verse, right?
- Right.

1533
00:53:39,653 --> 00:53:41,562
I'm sure you all know the first verse.

1534
00:53:41,563 --> 00:53:43,323
We'll go for the second verse.

1535
00:53:43,993 --> 00:53:45,192
I don't know the second verse.

1536
00:53:45,193 --> 00:53:46,553
The first verse is the famous one.

1537
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:47,992
I don't know the lyrics at all.

1538
00:53:47,993 --> 00:53:49,993
You don't want us to sit on the cable car, do you?

1539
00:53:50,163 --> 00:53:51,973
This will be a group mission.

1540
00:53:52,173 --> 00:53:54,272
You will listen to the song we play.

1541
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,603
You have to sing the song with the accurate lyrics.

1542
00:53:57,273 --> 00:54:00,072
You have a total of five times to go for the mission.

1543
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:02,142
You have three chances.

1544
00:54:02,143 --> 00:54:03,943
- Okay.
- We shouldn't swap seats.

1545
00:54:04,383 --> 00:54:06,552
- We can do this.
- Let's go!

1546
00:54:06,553 --> 00:54:07,952
We can do this, come on.

1547
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,122
- Just memorize your part.
- Memorize your part, it's easy.

1548
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:12,693
I won't let it slip if you don't memorize it.

1549
00:54:13,093 --> 00:54:16,362
We'll play "Ulleung Island Twist" now.

1550
00:54:16,363 --> 00:54:18,192
- You have to listen carefully.
- When the song ends,

1551
00:54:18,193 --> 00:54:20,362
- you cannot discuss.
- I got it.

1552
00:54:20,363 --> 00:54:23,033
You'll pick your seats after listening to the song.

1553
00:54:23,233 --> 00:54:24,463
This will confuse us.

1554
00:54:24,633 --> 00:54:25,702
- We have to listen...
- Let's start.

1555
00:54:25,703 --> 00:54:28,172
- The song isn't so hard.
- It's not.

1556
00:54:28,173 --> 00:54:29,672
My generation listened to this song a lot.

1557
00:54:29,673 --> 00:54:32,012
- These young boys don't know this.
- Don't get nervous.

1558
00:54:32,013 --> 00:54:33,149
(It could be quite new to the younger generation.)

1559
00:54:33,173 --> 00:54:35,259
It will be okay as long as we listen carefully to the song.

1560
00:54:35,283 --> 00:54:36,642
It's fine as long as we get one letter wrong.

1561
00:54:36,643 --> 00:54:37,912
Let's start then.

1562
00:54:37,913 --> 00:54:39,482
Please play the song.

1563
00:54:39,483 --> 00:54:40,483
(Today's song: "Ulleung Island Twist")

1564
00:54:40,484 --> 00:54:41,512
Let's start.

1565
00:54:41,513 --> 00:54:43,283
(Today's song: "Ulleung Island Twist")

1566
00:54:43,983 --> 00:54:46,453
- Don't interrupt while it plays.
- All right.

1567
00:54:48,593 --> 00:54:49,593
(I told you not to interrupt.)

1568
00:54:49,594 --> 00:54:50,962
- Don't interrupt.
- Let's go.

1569
00:54:50,963 --> 00:54:52,163
(I told you not to interrupt.)

1570
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:58,133
(Verse)

1571
00:55:06,943 --> 00:55:08,013
Okay.

1572
00:55:20,753 --> 00:55:22,433
- What?
- You pointed to the wrong person.

1573
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:34,672
(All together)

1574
00:55:34,673 --> 00:55:36,872
He intentionally made it confusing.

1575
00:55:36,873 --> 00:55:38,002
What was that?

1576
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:39,642
You just confused us with that pointer.

1577
00:55:39,643 --> 00:55:41,472
You changed the pointer when a sentence wasn't done.

1578
00:55:41,473 --> 00:55:43,482
- We were all confused.
- You changed it too fast.

1579
00:55:43,483 --> 00:55:45,012
You moved the pointer when the verse wasn't done.

1580
00:55:45,013 --> 00:55:47,053
- Right.
- You got us confused.

1581
00:55:47,213 --> 00:55:48,822
This is either this or that.

1582
00:55:48,823 --> 00:55:50,783
We go into the water or listen to the song again.

1583
00:55:51,453 --> 00:55:53,552
- You have to be clear.
- I did make it clear.

1584
00:55:53,553 --> 00:55:54,652
This is...

1585
00:55:54,653 --> 00:55:56,362
You changed the pointer and made it confusing.

1586
00:55:56,363 --> 00:55:58,833
- So we don't know which part...
- Let's pick the spoons.

1587
00:55:59,293 --> 00:56:00,333
- What?
- This can't be...

1588
00:56:00,763 --> 00:56:01,862
This is...

1589
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:04,039
- We'll get it wrong anyway.
- Right, we have to try it.

1590
00:56:04,063 --> 00:56:05,673
- Give me that.
- That was so not clear.

1591
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:07,832
You know you did it wrong, yes?

1592
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,102
No, I made it very clear.

1593
00:56:09,103 --> 00:56:10,819
How can you sing the next verse while singing?

1594
00:56:10,843 --> 00:56:12,143
It has to be verse-by-verse.

1595
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:14,412
This is my seat.

1596
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:15,842
- This is my part anyway.
- You'll stay here?

1597
00:56:15,843 --> 00:56:16,843
(Changing seats)

1598
00:56:16,943 --> 00:56:18,983
(This was their first seat arrangement.)

1599
00:56:19,153 --> 00:56:20,612
I have no idea what the lyrics were.

1600
00:56:20,613 --> 00:56:22,183
Let's just go for it anyway.

1601
00:56:22,423 --> 00:56:23,522
- Sure.
- We won't get it this time.

1602
00:56:23,523 --> 00:56:24,752
- Right.
- Let's discuss after this.

1603
00:56:24,753 --> 00:56:27,792
Let's see how many times we'll try to clear the mission.

1604
00:56:27,793 --> 00:56:30,492
We'll have our first go.

1605
00:56:30,493 --> 00:56:32,392
Please play the music.

1606
00:56:32,393 --> 00:56:33,393
Let's go!

1607
00:56:33,633 --> 00:56:35,132
Tell us the names.

1608
00:56:35,133 --> 00:56:36,339
("Ulleung Island Twist" by Lee Sisters)

1609
00:56:36,363 --> 00:56:38,433
(First attempt)

1610
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:43,303
(How far would they go on their first attempt?)

1611
00:56:43,343 --> 00:56:44,343
Joon.

1612
00:56:44,344 --> 00:56:46,412
(The rolling, winding road of Ulleung Island)

1613
00:56:46,413 --> 00:56:47,572
Jong Min.

1614
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:50,042
(Missing the ferry)

1615
00:56:50,043 --> 00:56:51,113
Wrong. You failed.

1616
00:56:51,813 --> 00:56:53,152
Okay, I got it.

1617
00:56:53,153 --> 00:56:54,712
- What do you mean?
- The ferry's worn out.

1618
00:56:54,713 --> 00:56:57,029
- He doesn't know the lyrics at all.
- Missing the ferry...

1619
00:56:57,053 --> 00:56:59,492
"Even the ferry’s utterly worn out."

1620
00:56:59,493 --> 00:57:02,299
- Even the ferry’s utterly worn out.
- Even the ferry’s utterly worn out.

1621
00:57:02,323 --> 00:57:04,323
- What was your part again?
- Dizzy, staggering...

1622
00:57:04,393 --> 00:57:05,592
We're in big trouble.

1623
00:57:05,593 --> 00:57:06,792
- Who was in charge of Part Three?
- It's me.

1624
00:57:06,793 --> 00:57:08,193
- What?
- You should have listened.

1625
00:57:08,293 --> 00:57:09,933
It's your part. You should have listened.

1626
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:11,702
(Dizzy)

1627
00:57:11,703 --> 00:57:14,133
(Staggering, Ulleung Island road)

1628
00:57:14,703 --> 00:57:17,602
I don't think I heard the word "Dizzy."

1629
00:57:17,603 --> 00:57:19,412
- No, dizzy.
- Dizzy

1630
00:57:19,413 --> 00:57:20,442
Dizzy.

1631
00:57:20,443 --> 00:57:22,142
Dizzy, staggering

1632
00:57:22,143 --> 00:57:23,212
(Is this even right?)

1633
00:57:23,213 --> 00:57:24,612
- Staggering?
- What are you doing?

1634
00:57:24,613 --> 00:57:25,753
What's wrong with you?

1635
00:57:26,413 --> 00:57:27,913
I mean... What's wrong with you?

1636
00:57:28,623 --> 00:57:30,422
(Taking out on him)

1637
00:57:30,423 --> 00:57:31,952
You should have listened to your part.

1638
00:57:31,953 --> 00:57:33,023
(This is going crazy.)

1639
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:35,792
(Dizzy, staggering, Ulleung Island road)

1640
00:57:35,793 --> 00:57:37,192
(This is Ulleung Island)

1641
00:57:37,193 --> 00:57:38,223
That must be correct.

1642
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:41,333
- That's my part.
- Right.

1643
00:57:41,393 --> 00:57:42,502
And next, you...

1644
00:57:42,503 --> 00:57:45,732
(Your whole life...)

1645
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:48,402
Is it the next verse?

1646
00:57:48,403 --> 00:57:50,272
Should we give you a hint without the words?

1647
00:57:50,273 --> 00:57:51,542
(Shall we give them a hint without the lyrics?)

1648
00:57:51,543 --> 00:57:54,942
(Giving them a hint)

1649
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,912
(Giving them a hint)

1650
00:57:56,913 --> 00:57:57,942
This is how it goes.

1651
00:57:57,943 --> 00:57:59,013
What's next?

1652
00:57:59,213 --> 00:58:01,082
(Singing)

1653
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,122
(Singing)

1654
00:58:02,123 --> 00:58:03,882
(What is that?)

1655
00:58:03,883 --> 00:58:05,553
Wrong. You failed.

1656
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,122
This is too hard.

1657
00:58:08,123 --> 00:58:09,662
- What is this?
- We have no clue.

1658
00:58:09,663 --> 00:58:11,622
- Let's use our chance.
- Let's do that.

1659
00:58:11,623 --> 00:58:13,592
- Who needs it?
- Seon Ho.

1660
00:58:13,593 --> 00:58:14,732
You're the youngest one, go for it.

1661
00:58:14,733 --> 00:58:16,502
(Seon Ho, the youngest one, picks the card.)

1662
00:58:16,503 --> 00:58:19,023
- I'll pick the yellow one.
- Even the ferry’s utterly worn out

1663
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:20,603
This is how we do it.

1664
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:22,073
(Will they get it?)

1665
00:58:22,173 --> 00:58:23,502
(The first chance is very important to them right now.)

1666
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:26,343
- One, two, three.
- Let me see.

1667
00:58:26,613 --> 00:58:27,872
We get to listen to the whole song again.

1668
00:58:27,873 --> 00:58:29,389
(The first chance: Listen to the whole song again)

1669
00:58:29,413 --> 00:58:30,582
(He picked the best one there.)

1670
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:31,952
- We got this.
- You all memorize your parts.

1671
00:58:31,953 --> 00:58:34,582
- Just listen to your own part.
- Goodness.

1672
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:35,882
- Just listen to your own part.
- Okay.

1673
00:58:35,883 --> 00:58:37,482
This is the best one we can get.

1674
00:58:37,483 --> 00:58:38,552
Please play the music.

1675
00:58:38,553 --> 00:58:40,252
- Okay.
- Let's listen now.

1676
00:58:40,253 --> 00:58:41,552
- Let's go.
- Start.

1677
00:58:41,553 --> 00:58:42,562
(Re-play starts now.)

00:58:42,563 --> 00:58:44,693

(All together)

1680
00:59:22,003 --> 00:59:23,733
- Let's fall in love - Let's fall in love

1681
00:59:24,203 --> 00:59:26,132
- Let's go.
- You can't discuss.

1682
00:59:26,133 --> 00:59:27,409
We have to get it right this time.

1683
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:29,703
This would be our second attempt.

1684
00:59:30,643 --> 00:59:31,873
Please start the music.

(Singing)

1687
00:59:37,413 --> 00:59:39,612
- We'll get it.
- I feel like we'll get it.

1688
00:59:39,613 --> 00:59:41,482
- Come to Ulleung Island.
- Let's go!

- What?
- Wrong. You failed.

1694
00:59:52,893 --> 00:59:54,662
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

1695
00:59:54,663 --> 00:59:56,962
- What's wrong with you?
- Why are you doing this?

1696
00:59:56,963 --> 00:59:59,573
- Come on, why did you get it wrong?
- How can you get it wrong?

00:59:59,703 --> 01:00:01,502
- Jong Min.
- Give me one more chance.

1699

1701

1711
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:29,832

1714
01:00:37,173 --> 01:00:38,842
Plenty? Was there such a word?

1715
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:39,872
I know, give me an example.

1716
01:00:39,873 --> 01:00:41,713
(DinDin didn't get to listen to the 7th part.)

1717
01:00:41,873 --> 01:00:43,942
- Much?
- How does it even fit?

1718
01:00:43,943 --> 01:00:45,903
It's something like, "Enjoying plenty of planes."

1719
01:00:46,213 --> 01:00:47,512
Gosh, we're in trouble.

1720
01:00:47,513 --> 01:00:49,352
- I told you!
- This isn't easy.

1721
01:00:49,353 --> 01:00:51,029
How can we not know when we listened to the song?

1722
01:00:51,053 --> 01:00:52,922
- More than trains - I know.

1723
01:00:52,923 --> 01:00:54,352
(You can still enjoy plenty of planes better than trains)

1724
01:00:54,353 --> 01:00:55,722
- That's right.
- Yes! That's it.

1725
01:00:55,723 --> 01:00:56,792
"Plenty" is correct.

1726
01:00:56,793 --> 01:00:59,192
(Just going with it thanks to the lyrics that popped up)

01:01:00,293 --> 01:01:02,032
(Still enjoy plenty of planes)

1729
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,362
Okay. Can we do it?

1730
01:01:03,363 --> 01:01:04,462
(Smiling)

1731
01:01:04,463 --> 01:01:06,002
(Smiling, grinning)

1732
01:01:06,003 --> 01:01:08,902
(Smiling, grinning)

1733
01:01:08,903 --> 01:01:10,573
(Smiling, grinning, young men and women)

1734
01:01:10,843 --> 01:01:15,013
(Come on, grandpa, dance with us)

1735
01:01:15,143 --> 01:01:17,542
(Squid's a big catch today, twist)

1736
01:01:17,543 --> 01:01:19,183
(Let's fall in love)

1737
01:01:19,283 --> 01:01:20,752
- Let's all do it once.
- Let's all do it once.

1738
01:01:20,753 --> 01:01:23,082
- Ready...
- What was mine? Smiling

1739
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,652
"Smiling, grinning."

1740
01:01:24,653 --> 01:01:26,152
- Wait. What?
- Good, let's go!

1741
01:01:26,153 --> 01:01:28,822
"Smiling, grinning."

1742
01:01:28,823 --> 01:01:30,063
(Frustrated and sighing)

1743
01:01:30,693 --> 01:01:31,822
Good, let's go!

1744
01:01:31,823 --> 01:01:33,433
"Smiling, grinning."

1745
01:01:33,493 --> 01:01:34,593
Uri Geller.

1746
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:37,332
Grinning

1747
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:38,802
"Smiling, grinning!"

1748
01:01:38,803 --> 01:01:40,103
He's good.

1749
01:01:40,373 --> 01:01:41,673
Jong Min Geller.

1750
01:01:41,933 --> 01:01:44,343
(Joon Geller also joins.)

1751
01:01:44,573 --> 01:01:47,713
(They're all doing what they want to do.)

1752
01:01:48,113 --> 01:01:49,312
He's good.

1753
01:01:49,313 --> 01:01:51,213
Please focus!

1754
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,353
Please focus!

1755
01:01:53,953 --> 01:01:56,953
(He gets scolded in the end.)

1756
01:01:57,153 --> 01:01:58,522
(Focusing)

1757
01:01:58,523 --> 01:01:59,592
Grinning

1758
01:01:59,593 --> 01:02:01,323
It's smiling.

1759
01:02:01,493 --> 01:02:03,123
Aren't you mad?

1760
01:02:03,463 --> 01:02:04,963
He's really something.

1761
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:06,562
Is he trying to be funny or what?

1762
01:02:06,563 --> 01:02:08,133
If you get it wrong this time,

1763
01:02:08,463 --> 01:02:09,862
you should get hit with a spoon.

1764
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:11,532
- Here.
- At the back of your head.

1765
01:02:11,533 --> 01:02:13,102
- You'll get hit like this.
- Not the back of the head.

1766
01:02:13,103 --> 01:02:14,302
- Here on the front.
- Here.

1767
01:02:14,303 --> 01:02:15,642
- Here.
- Let's do it.

1768
01:02:15,643 --> 01:02:17,002
You've never listened to this song, have you?

1769
01:02:17,003 --> 01:02:18,872
- It's my first time hearing it.
- That's why.

1770
01:02:18,873 --> 01:02:22,313
We'll start the third attempt.

1771
01:02:22,643 --> 01:02:23,813
Give us...

1772
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:25,753
- the music.
- Let's go!

1773
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:26,953
Let's go!

1774
01:02:27,013 --> 01:02:29,853
"Even the ferry’s utterly worn out."

1775
01:02:30,253 --> 01:02:32,793
Is it, "Dizzy, staggering?"

1776
01:02:33,123 --> 01:02:34,423
"Dizzy, staggering."

1777
01:02:34,653 --> 01:02:37,063
(Jong Min Geller is still here.)

1778
01:02:37,123 --> 01:02:41,862
(The rolling, wobbly road of Ulleung Island)

1779
01:02:41,863 --> 01:02:44,962
(Even the ferry’s utterly worn out)

1780
01:02:44,963 --> 01:02:48,532
(Dizzy, staggering, twist around)

1781
01:02:48,533 --> 01:02:51,342
(This is Ulleung Island, right here!)

1782
01:02:51,343 --> 01:02:52,542
- Nice!
- Nice!

1783
01:02:52,543 --> 01:02:55,682
(Even if you live your whole life)

1784
01:02:55,683 --> 01:02:59,282
(Without ever seeing a train)

1785
01:02:59,283 --> 01:03:02,983
(You can still enjoy plenty of planes)

1786
01:03:03,483 --> 01:03:04,853
- Why?
- What?

1787
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:06,152
- What was wrong?
- It wasn't "plenty."

1788
01:03:06,153 --> 01:03:07,222
- It wasn't that.
- What was it?

1789
01:03:07,223 --> 01:03:09,022
But you moved on.

1790
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:10,992
No. DinDin got it wrong

1791
01:03:10,993 --> 01:03:12,862
- It's not "plenty"
- It's "all you want."

1792
01:03:12,863 --> 01:03:14,762
- DinDin got it wrong.
- No, but this is...

1793
01:03:14,763 --> 01:03:16,402
- It's "all you want."
- It's not my fault.

1794
01:03:16,403 --> 01:03:18,062
- I didn't get this wrong.
- Then who got it wrong?

1795
01:03:18,063 --> 01:03:19,932
- I sang what we knew well.
- You're supposed to get hit.

1796
01:03:19,933 --> 01:03:21,532
- You got it wrong.
- You should get hit.

1797
01:03:21,533 --> 01:03:23,142
But this isn't the same.

1798
01:03:23,143 --> 01:03:25,303
One, two, three.

1799
01:03:25,543 --> 01:03:26,612
- Hold on.
- It's "all you want."

1800
01:03:26,613 --> 01:03:28,172
- It's "all you want."
- It's "all you want."

1801
01:03:28,173 --> 01:03:30,882
- Better than trains all you want - Okay.

1802
01:03:30,883 --> 01:03:33,512
- We have two chances left.
- Let's use a hint.

1803
01:03:33,513 --> 01:03:34,812
We have two hints left.

1804
01:03:34,813 --> 01:03:36,322
- If we get "Exchange spots,"
- No.

1805
01:03:36,323 --> 01:03:37,323
- things get tricky.
- Sae Ho.

1806
01:03:37,324 --> 01:03:39,452
But it doesn't matter even if we exchange spots.

1807
01:03:39,453 --> 01:03:41,052
- No. It matters.
- I know nothing.

1808
01:03:41,053 --> 01:03:42,222
I only know mine.

1809
01:03:42,223 --> 01:03:43,793
But we're not sure...

1810
01:03:44,163 --> 01:03:45,732
about Se Yoon's line.

1811
01:03:45,733 --> 01:03:47,232
- We have to make it clear.
- This is the last...

1812
01:03:47,233 --> 01:03:49,302
- Let's pick one. DinDin...
- No.

1813
01:03:49,303 --> 01:03:50,932
No. If we get "Exchange spots," we're done.

1814
01:03:50,933 --> 01:03:52,202
- We won't get "Exchange spots."
- It would be the end.

1815
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,509
- We won't get "Exchange spots."
- We can learn the lyrics.

1816
01:03:54,533 --> 01:03:56,402
- It would be the end.
- It has to come now if it should.

1817
01:03:56,403 --> 01:03:58,343
It would be the end. Please.

1818
01:03:58,973 --> 01:04:00,513
- What is this?
- What is it?

1819
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:02,843
"Fan eyesight, showing one line."

1820
01:04:03,313 --> 01:04:04,613
What's a "fan eyesight?"

1821
01:04:04,743 --> 01:04:06,129
- What is that?
- Will they show it on a fan?

1822
01:04:06,153 --> 01:04:08,453
Tell us the line you need.

1823
01:04:08,613 --> 01:04:10,552
- Let's see mine.
- Okay.

1824
01:04:10,553 --> 01:04:11,952
We'll see Se Yoon's line.

1825
01:04:11,953 --> 01:04:13,793
- We'll see Se Yoon's line.
- Okay.

1826
01:04:14,753 --> 01:04:18,463
(What would "fan eyesight" be?)

1827
01:04:18,523 --> 01:04:20,933
Ready, go!

1828
01:04:23,603 --> 01:04:24,733
"Thinking."

1829
01:04:25,873 --> 01:04:26,972
"Live."

1830
01:04:26,973 --> 01:04:28,149
(The lyrics just pass by in the blink of an eye.)

1831
01:04:28,173 --> 01:04:30,573
(Would they have seen the lyrics?)

1832
01:04:30,643 --> 01:04:31,842
- "All you want."
- "All you want."

1833
01:04:31,843 --> 01:04:33,012
"Better than trains all you want."

1834
01:04:33,013 --> 01:04:34,712
- "Better than trains all you want."
- "Better than trains all you want."

1835
01:04:34,713 --> 01:04:36,013
(What would it be?)

1836
01:04:36,713 --> 01:04:38,512
(They read it well.)

1837
01:04:38,513 --> 01:04:39,912
It's "better than trains all you want."

1838
01:04:39,913 --> 01:04:40,982
What about "enjoy it all you want?"

1839
01:04:40,983 --> 01:04:42,382
(7: You can still enjoy planes 8: Better than trains all you want)

1840
01:04:42,383 --> 01:04:44,183
(But it had to go on Part 7.)

1841
01:04:44,223 --> 01:04:47,592
(You can still enjoy planes)

1842
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:49,592
(Better than trains all you want)

1843
01:04:49,593 --> 01:04:50,722
It's "enjoy."

1844
01:04:50,723 --> 01:04:51,992
"Enjoy planes."

1845
01:04:51,993 --> 01:04:53,532
- Was it?
- "All you want." I'm sure.

1846
01:04:53,533 --> 01:04:54,592
I'm sure.

1847
01:04:54,593 --> 01:04:55,762
Don't discuss.

1848
01:04:55,763 --> 01:04:58,003
We did all the discussions.

1849
01:04:58,763 --> 01:05:01,932
You'll get hit if you get it wrong.

1850
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:03,703
We don't have many chances left.

1851
01:05:03,773 --> 01:05:07,273
Let's start the fourth attempt.

1852
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:11,483
("Ulleung Island Twist" by Lee Sisters)

1853
01:05:11,813 --> 01:05:13,512
(Please...)

1854
01:05:13,513 --> 01:05:15,753
(Let's succeed this time.)

1855
01:05:17,453 --> 01:05:18,482
Joon!

1856
01:05:18,483 --> 01:05:21,592
(The rolling, wobbly road of Ulleung Island)

1857
01:05:21,593 --> 01:05:24,592
(Even the ferry’s utterly worn out)

1858
01:05:24,593 --> 01:05:28,832
(Dizzy, staggering, twist around)

1859
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:31,833
(This is Ulleung Island right here)

1860
01:05:32,233 --> 01:05:36,003
(Finally, it's DinDin's turn again.)

1861
01:05:36,273 --> 01:05:39,813
(Would they be able to pass this time?)

1862
01:05:40,022 --> 01:05:43,091
(The rolling, wobbly road of Ulleung Island)

1863
01:05:43,092 --> 01:05:46,162

01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:53,013
(This is Ulleung Island right here)

1866
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,809
(Even if you live your whole life)

1867
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:57,109
(Ever without)

1868
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,169
Incorrect!

1869
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:00,239
- What is that?
- What are you doing?

1870
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,410
(It's DinDin again.)

1871
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,060
- What is that?
- What are you doing?

1872
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,720
(They're flustered.)

1873
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:08,971
(They failed the fourth attempt.)

1874
01:06:08,972 --> 01:06:10,602
What's "ever without?"

1875
01:06:10,972 --> 01:06:12,402
- "Ever without?"
- What happened?

1876
01:06:12,812 --> 01:06:13,812
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1877
01:06:13,813 --> 01:06:15,612
You meddled with ours so much.

1878
01:06:15,712 --> 01:06:17,981
What are you doing? You scolded me earlier.

1879
01:06:17,982 --> 01:06:20,251
It was getting out of tune so much,

1880
01:06:20,252 --> 01:06:21,611
so I thought I should bring it back.

1881
01:06:21,612 --> 01:06:23,121
I messed up the lyrics while thinking about the tune.

1882
01:06:23,122 --> 01:06:24,781
Why would you think about the tune?

1883
01:06:24,782 --> 01:06:26,251
- Why would the tune be important?
- Why's the tune important?

1884
01:06:26,252 --> 01:06:27,951
- Why is the tune important?
- I'm a singer.

1885
01:06:27,952 --> 01:06:29,792
- Are you the original singer?
- Goodness.

1886
01:06:29,822 --> 01:06:31,521
We blew up this chance so easily.

1887
01:06:31,522 --> 01:06:32,661
For nothing.

1888
01:06:32,662 --> 01:06:35,791
Let me pick the hint.

1889
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:36,931
- I'll take responsibility.
- No.

1890
01:06:36,932 --> 01:06:38,561
It's better not to pick it now.

1891
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:40,601
- There could be "Exchange spots."
- Right.

1892
01:06:40,602 --> 01:06:41,602
- It could be dangerous.
- Let's just go like this.

1893
01:06:41,603 --> 01:06:43,001
- Okay.
- Is this our last chance?

1894
01:06:43,002 --> 01:06:44,071
- Yes.
- It's the last chance.

1895
01:06:44,072 --> 01:06:45,171
I'll take responsibility.

1896
01:06:45,172 --> 01:06:46,311
I can surely do it.

1897
01:06:46,312 --> 01:06:47,411
Trust me.

1898
01:06:47,412 --> 01:06:49,041
- Can you be responsible?
- Trust me. I'll be responsible.

1899
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:50,681
If you get "Exchange spots," we're done.

1900
01:06:50,682 --> 01:06:52,851
- I'll pick one!
- What's wrong with you?

1901
01:06:52,852 --> 01:06:53,852
Don't do it.

1902
01:06:53,852 --> 01:06:54,852
- Why?
- I'll pull out your front tooth...

1903
01:06:54,853 --> 01:06:56,053
if you pull out the wrong one.

1904
01:06:56,552 --> 01:06:58,381
I'll pull out your front tooth.

1905
01:06:58,382 --> 01:07:00,252
- Okay.
- No.

1906
01:07:00,422 --> 01:07:01,921
If you're so certain, go for it.

1907
01:07:01,922 --> 01:07:03,461
- Do it since it's a variety show.
- Yes.

1908
01:07:03,462 --> 01:07:04,961
- But...
- What's wrong with him?

1909
01:07:04,962 --> 01:07:07,131
We know all the lyrics.

1910
01:07:07,132 --> 01:07:09,562
(There are two chance papers.)

1911
01:07:09,702 --> 01:07:12,362
(One of the two is Exchange spots.)

1912
01:07:12,802 --> 01:07:14,001
- Really?
- Yes.

1913
01:07:14,002 --> 01:07:15,872
(The pressure is on him.)

1914
01:07:16,142 --> 01:07:17,801
- This...
- Can you take the responsibility?

1915
01:07:17,802 --> 01:07:18,841
Didn't you pick?

1916
01:07:18,842 --> 01:07:21,242
- Can you take the responsibility?
- Why...

1917
01:07:21,372 --> 01:07:22,912
You should take the responsibility.

1918
01:07:24,742 --> 01:07:26,611
(He chose one after a long thought.)

1919
01:07:26,612 --> 01:07:28,151
There's his front tooth.

1920
01:07:28,152 --> 01:07:29,621
You can take the responsibility, right?

1921
01:07:29,622 --> 01:07:30,622
(He's very pressured.)

1922
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:32,221
(DinDin holds their fate in his hands.)

1923
01:07:32,222 --> 01:07:34,292
If you picked the wrong one, we're done for.

1924
01:07:35,622 --> 01:07:37,122
(Making a fuss)

1925
01:07:37,922 --> 01:07:39,892
(Replay the entire song at double speed.)

1926
01:07:40,232 --> 01:07:42,461
- What's that?
- Double speed.

1927
01:07:42,462 --> 01:07:43,631
You picked a good one.

1928
01:07:43,632 --> 01:07:44,831
- It's a relief.
- It's a relief.

1929
01:07:44,832 --> 01:07:47,031
I had the feeling.

1930
01:07:47,032 --> 01:07:48,401
Okay. Your front tooth stays.

1931
01:07:48,402 --> 01:07:50,271
- You have to focus.
- Okay!

1932
01:07:50,272 --> 01:07:51,441
We know our parts well.

1933
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,141
- You three need to focus.
- Right.

1934
01:07:53,142 --> 01:07:56,311
Honestly, Part Five is the hardest.

1935
01:07:56,312 --> 01:07:57,741
What do you mean? It's the same for everyone.

1936
01:07:57,742 --> 01:07:58,881
It's the same.

1937
01:07:58,882 --> 01:08:01,081
After listening to this, you won't get to discuss.

1938
01:08:01,082 --> 01:08:02,251
- Okay.
- You know it, right?

1939
01:08:02,252 --> 01:08:03,721
It would be crazy if we got this one wrong.

1940
01:08:03,722 --> 01:08:05,851
- It's over when we get it wrong.
- Don't use more chances.

1941
01:08:05,852 --> 01:08:07,151
We just need to focus once.

1942
01:08:07,152 --> 01:08:08,321
Just focus.

1943
01:08:08,322 --> 01:08:09,591
- Don't make jokes.
- I'll play it.

1944
01:08:09,592 --> 01:08:12,762
(Playing at double speed)

1945
01:08:13,232 --> 01:08:14,832
- What are you doing?
- I can't hear it.

1946
01:08:30,142 --> 01:08:31,212
"Enjoy."

1947
01:08:36,482 --> 01:08:38,351
(Parts)

1948
01:08:38,352 --> 01:08:39,391
- It's here.
- Okay.

1949
01:08:39,392 --> 01:08:40,992
You can't discuss.

1950
01:08:42,092 --> 01:08:43,961
(I need to memorize it, no matter what!)

1951
01:08:43,962 --> 01:08:45,161
The last attempt!

1952
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,162
Hurry!

1953
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:48,231
This is the last attempt.

1954
01:08:48,232 --> 01:08:49,361
- Yes.
- You have to focus.

1955
01:08:49,362 --> 01:08:50,761
Think of it as a CSAT.

1956
01:08:50,762 --> 01:08:52,101
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1957
01:08:52,102 --> 01:08:53,801
Play the music.

1958
01:08:53,802 --> 01:08:55,131
Our lives are on the line.

1959
01:08:55,132 --> 01:08:56,932
(The last attempt that their lives depend on)

1960
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:59,542
(They could take a cable car comfortably...)

1961
01:09:00,172 --> 01:09:02,542
(or walk up with difficulty.)

1962
01:09:03,842 --> 01:09:07,012
(What would their fate be?)

1963
01:09:07,412 --> 01:09:10,922
(They're nervous.)

1964
01:09:13,022 --> 01:09:14,022
Joon!

1965
01:09:14,023 --> 01:09:16,921
(The rolling, wobbly road of Ulleung Island)

1966
01:09:16,922 --> 01:09:19,861
(Even the ferry’s utterly worn out)

1967
01:09:19,862 --> 01:09:23,761
(Dizzy, staggering, twist around)

1968
01:09:23,762 --> 01:09:27,171
(This is Ulleung Island right here)

1969
01:09:27,172 --> 01:09:31,001
(Even if you live your whole life)

1970
01:09:31,002 --> 01:09:34,411
(Without ever seeing a train)

1971
01:09:34,412 --> 01:09:37,941
(You can still enjoy planes)

1972
01:09:37,942 --> 01:09:41,482
(Better than trains all you want)

1973
01:09:42,452 --> 01:09:44,882
(They passed through the most challenging section.)

1974
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:46,992
(They got through one hurdle.)

1975
01:09:47,222 --> 01:09:50,292
(It's Seon Ho's turn now.)

1976
01:09:50,862 --> 01:09:54,132
(Would Seon Ho be able to make it?)

1977
01:09:54,692 --> 01:09:58,101
(Better than trains all you want)

1978
01:09:58,102 --> 01:10:01,532
(Smiling, grinning, young men and women)

1979
01:10:01,932 --> 01:10:04,902
(Seon Ho sings his part without trouble as well.)

1980
01:10:04,942 --> 01:10:08,271
(Come on, grandpa, dance with us)

1981
01:10:08,272 --> 01:10:11,441
(Squid’s a big catch today, twist)

1982
01:10:11,442 --> 01:10:14,982
(Let’s fall in love)

1983
01:10:15,082 --> 01:10:17,451
- Let's fall in love - Let's fall in love

1984
01:10:17,452 --> 01:10:20,651
(Toy Hammer Karaoke, pass)

1985
01:10:20,652 --> 01:10:21,652
- We did it!
- Yes!

1986
01:10:21,653 --> 01:10:23,261
I completely lost it toward the end!

1987
01:10:23,262 --> 01:10:24,461
- Gosh!
- Nice one.

1988
01:10:24,462 --> 01:10:26,962
I completely lost it toward the end!

1989
01:10:28,062 --> 01:10:30,662
(They barely manage to pass with their last attempt.)

1990
01:10:30,832 --> 01:10:32,971
Gosh, I was about to go crazy.

1991
01:10:32,972 --> 01:10:34,212
Why struggle so much with this?

1992
01:10:35,002 --> 01:10:36,002
(Their hearts are still shaking like crazy.)

1993
01:10:36,003 --> 01:10:37,142
Gosh, I felt so nervous.

1994
01:10:37,472 --> 01:10:39,711
- Toy Hammer Karaoke.
- I felt so scared.

1995
01:10:39,712 --> 01:10:41,872
Congratulations, you have made it through.

1996
01:10:41,972 --> 01:10:43,681
Out of all of the missions we did,

1997
01:10:43,682 --> 01:10:45,841
- this was the most nerve-wracking.
- I was fine during the third try.

1998
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:47,251
- At the fourth try, - It felt tense.

1999
01:10:47,252 --> 01:10:49,682
- my heart shook like crazy.
- Right. That's how it is.

2000
01:10:49,782 --> 01:10:51,821
We will move with the cable car.

2001
01:10:51,822 --> 01:10:53,252
- Okay!
- Yes!

2002
01:10:53,852 --> 01:10:55,822
Let's take a picture. It's amazing here.

2003
01:10:56,922 --> 01:11:00,232
- One, two, three!
- We have to take a picture.

2004
01:11:00,732 --> 01:11:05,362
(In front of Turtle Rock)

2005
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:07,332
Gosh, Ulleung Island is great.

2006
01:11:08,002 --> 01:11:10,102
Staying here one night isn't enough.

2007
01:11:10,372 --> 01:11:11,818
You have to stay here for at least three nights.

2008
01:11:11,842 --> 01:11:13,602
I want to stay here for around half a month.

2009
01:11:14,442 --> 01:11:16,712
(They have all fallen for the charms of Ulleung Island.)

2010
01:11:17,312 --> 01:11:19,652
The roads of Ulleung Island are beautiful.

2011
01:11:20,382 --> 01:11:21,881
Look to the right.

2012
01:11:21,882 --> 01:11:23,281
- Exactly.
- It's just amazing.

2013
01:11:23,282 --> 01:11:25,251
The color of the sea is unreal.

2014
01:11:25,252 --> 01:11:27,491
Right. Gosh, look at that.

2015
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:29,022
(A picturesque tone of blue)

2016
01:11:29,922 --> 01:11:31,392
Gosh.

2017
01:11:31,922 --> 01:11:33,091
I'm loving the vibes.

2018
01:11:33,092 --> 01:11:35,092
(Ulleung Island's scenery full of great vibes)

2019
01:11:35,232 --> 01:11:37,831
The seagull of Ulleung Island looks quite determined.

2020
01:11:37,832 --> 01:11:40,702
(The seagull of Ulleung Island looks quite determined.)

2021
01:11:41,432 --> 01:11:44,272
(After driving with the view of the sea, )

2022
01:11:46,442 --> 01:11:48,271
(they soon arrive at the next destination.)

2023
01:11:48,272 --> 01:11:49,342
We have to go up.

2024
01:11:49,412 --> 01:11:51,342
We almost had to walk up this.

2025
01:11:51,912 --> 01:11:53,352
My goodness.

2026
01:11:54,752 --> 01:11:56,382
There's the cable car for the view.

2027
01:11:57,722 --> 01:12:00,051
The cable car must be a lot of fun.

2028
01:12:00,052 --> 01:12:02,052
- It would've been bad to miss this.
- Why?

2029
01:12:02,122 --> 01:12:04,062
It looks so exciting.

2030
01:12:04,422 --> 01:12:05,962
This will have great vibes.

2031
01:12:06,732 --> 01:12:08,052
It will feel like an actual trip.

2032
01:12:08,692 --> 01:12:11,862
(They've earned a comfortable move through their success.)

2033
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:15,131
(To get to the observatory...)

2034
01:12:15,132 --> 01:12:17,542
- This is for the observatory.
- Nice!

2035
01:12:17,602 --> 01:12:19,572
- I should've walked up.
- This is amazing.

2036
01:12:20,172 --> 01:12:21,312
- Gosh.
- This is amazing.

2037
01:12:21,612 --> 01:12:22,742
Gosh, this is too scary.

2038
01:12:23,042 --> 01:12:24,142
- Gosh!
- Gosh.

2039
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:27,302
I'm not like this for no reason. It feels shaky.

2040
01:12:28,182 --> 01:12:30,121
- Gosh, hold on!
- We're moving.

2041
01:12:30,122 --> 01:12:31,821
Gosh, it's stable now.

2042
01:12:31,822 --> 01:12:32,891
It feels refreshing.

2043
01:12:32,892 --> 01:12:35,722
How is this much weight handled with just one line?

2044
01:12:35,922 --> 01:12:37,291
- Should I get up?
- Gosh!

2045
01:12:37,292 --> 01:12:39,792
(The cable car looks stable than ever.)

2046
01:12:40,032 --> 01:12:42,432
Hold on. I feel a bit scared too. Why am I feeling this way?

2047
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:45,101
- I was going to tease Jong Min.
- Check out the view of the area.

2048
01:12:45,102 --> 01:12:46,502
- Ulleung Island.
- It looks great!

2049
01:12:47,202 --> 01:12:49,742
(What is this?)

2050
01:12:50,442 --> 01:12:53,972
(They turn to see Ulleung Island at dusk.)

2051
01:12:56,012 --> 01:12:59,982
(It's a shelter for many.)

2052
01:13:01,112 --> 01:13:03,821
Ulleung Island can be seen here...

2053
01:13:03,822 --> 01:13:06,691
along with Dokdo. It's the Dokdo Sunrise Observatory.

2054
01:13:06,692 --> 01:13:08,251
Gosh, Dokdo can be seen here?

2055
01:13:08,252 --> 01:13:11,522
(Ulleung Island and Dokdo can be seen here.)

2056
01:13:12,592 --> 01:13:14,831
When the weather is clear,

2057
01:13:14,832 --> 01:13:16,261
Dokdo can be seen.

2058
01:13:16,262 --> 01:13:19,102
- The weather has to be clear?
- It's slightly foggy.

2059
01:13:19,262 --> 01:13:20,832
It can't be seen.

2060
01:13:21,072 --> 01:13:22,972
- It's too foggy to see it.
- It can't be seen.

2061
01:13:23,502 --> 01:13:25,101
- There's a bit of sea fog.
- Right.

2062
01:13:25,102 --> 01:13:26,711
We could see it when we visited before the shoot.

2063
01:13:26,712 --> 01:13:27,812
- Really?
- Yes.

2064
01:13:28,312 --> 01:13:31,742
(Dokdo can be seen when the weather is clear.)

2065
01:13:32,012 --> 01:13:33,851
The trip to Ulleung Island.

2066
01:13:33,852 --> 01:13:35,411
- How was it until now?
- It was great.

2067
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:36,621
- It was always great.
- Right.

2068
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:38,451
- I really wanted to come here.
- Right.

2069
01:13:38,452 --> 01:13:40,622
I'm happy to be able to visit through this experience.

2070
01:13:40,722 --> 01:13:41,951
- I believe it will be...
- Right.

2071
01:13:41,952 --> 01:13:43,591
A meaningful trip.

2072
01:13:43,592 --> 01:13:45,921
This is the biggest thing I felt...

2073
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,091
- after coming here.
- Okay.

2074
01:13:48,092 --> 01:13:49,561
The air smells really nice.

2075
01:13:49,562 --> 01:13:51,861
Right. It feels different here.

2076
01:13:51,862 --> 01:13:53,571
It's beautiful inside the water.

2077
01:13:53,572 --> 01:13:54,631
- Gosh.
- Right.

2078
01:13:54,632 --> 01:13:57,041
- With the diving suits.
- Right.

2079
01:13:57,042 --> 01:13:59,178
(The clear sea makes you want to dive in at any time.)

2080
01:13:59,202 --> 01:14:01,172
I really do want to experience it.

2081
01:14:01,912 --> 01:14:04,342
Everyone, unfortunately...

2082
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:05,942
- What? Unfortunately?
- What?

2083
01:14:06,012 --> 01:14:08,781
My Ulleung Island Notes ends here.

2084
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:10,698
- What? Are we going to Dokdo?
- What? We can go home now?

2085
01:14:10,722 --> 01:14:11,962
We can go home on the same day?

2086
01:14:12,582 --> 01:14:14,451
We're told to go home on our own after coming this far?

2087
01:14:14,452 --> 01:14:16,091
- What?
- Doesn't that feel worse?

2088
01:14:16,092 --> 01:14:17,761
Could it be that our base camp is in Pohang...

2089
01:14:17,762 --> 01:14:19,461
or Mokpo?

2090
01:14:19,462 --> 01:14:21,432
- What?
- We would have to move.

2091
01:14:21,492 --> 01:14:23,161
- It's a one-day trip?
- Right.

2092
01:14:23,162 --> 01:14:24,962
- No way.
- From now on,

2093
01:14:25,432 --> 01:14:28,031
we are about to start a special trip.

2094
01:14:28,032 --> 01:14:29,572
- What?
- What?

2095
01:14:29,672 --> 01:14:31,672
Someone is here...

2096
01:14:31,802 --> 01:14:34,111
- to join in on our trip.
- What?

2097
01:14:34,112 --> 01:14:35,871
- What?
- There's a guest?

2098
01:14:35,872 --> 01:14:37,182
- There's a guest?
- Right.

2099
01:14:37,342 --> 01:14:39,341
- Please come out!
- Is it a guest or what?

2100
01:14:39,342 --> 01:14:41,982
- To join My Ulleung Island Notes?
- A guest was brought this far?

2101
01:14:44,952 --> 01:14:47,121
- Professor!
- Hello!

2102
01:14:47,122 --> 01:14:48,292
It's Professor Seo!

2103
01:14:48,792 --> 01:14:51,922
(Why is the professor here?)

2104
01:14:53,062 --> 01:14:55,531
- Have you been doing well?
- Hello.

2105
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:56,601
(Welcome.)

2106
01:14:56,602 --> 01:14:57,901
It's Professor Seo Kyoung Duk.

2107
01:14:57,902 --> 01:14:59,432
- Right.
- Hello.

2108
01:14:59,502 --> 01:15:00,632
My goodness.

2109
01:15:02,102 --> 01:15:04,602
(He's Korea's global ambassador...)

2110
01:15:04,802 --> 01:15:07,842
(and works hard to consistently promote Dokdo.)

2111
01:15:08,342 --> 01:15:11,412
(Dokdo's Guardian, Professor Seo Kyoung Duk)

2112
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:13,381
Hello. It's great to see you.

2113
01:15:13,382 --> 01:15:16,781
I share Korea's culture and history around the world.

2114
01:15:16,782 --> 01:15:19,063
- I am Professor Seo Kyoung Duk.
- It's great to see you.

2115
01:15:19,252 --> 01:15:21,921
- He does a lot of great work.
- Right.

2116
01:15:21,922 --> 01:15:25,662
Before I met Professor Seo,

2117
01:15:25,762 --> 01:15:28,032
I barely knew anything about Korea's history.

2118
01:15:28,332 --> 01:15:29,862
After learning from him,

2119
01:15:30,302 --> 01:15:32,402
I really enjoyed it and even shed tears.

2120
01:15:33,002 --> 01:15:34,531
- I learned so much from him.
- Gosh.

2121
01:15:34,532 --> 01:15:36,771
- As I worked with you, - Right.

2122
01:15:36,772 --> 01:15:38,171
- I learned a lot as well.
- I see.

2123
01:15:38,172 --> 01:15:41,011
He corrects any false information from abroad regarding our history.

2124
01:15:41,012 --> 01:15:43,141
- Right.
- He fights for us and leads us.

2125
01:15:43,142 --> 01:15:45,181
So Professor Seo helped you a lot with Historian Kim's knowledge.

2126
01:15:45,182 --> 01:15:47,212
- Definitely.
- You got a lot of help from him.

2127
01:15:47,412 --> 01:15:50,722
October 25 is coming up.

2128
01:15:50,882 --> 01:15:52,882
- October 25?
- Do you know what day it is?

2129
01:15:53,022 --> 01:15:54,522
- October 25?
- Yes.

2130
01:15:54,622 --> 01:15:55,721
October 25?

2131
01:15:55,722 --> 01:15:56,992
(October 25?)

2132
01:15:57,162 --> 01:15:58,961
- It's Ulleung Island.
- Right.

2133
01:15:58,962 --> 01:16:00,591
We are reminded of Dokdo when we see him.

2134
01:16:00,592 --> 01:16:01,661
- Right.
- Dokdo Day?

2135
01:16:01,662 --> 01:16:03,331
- Right.
- So it's Dokdo Day.

2136
01:16:03,332 --> 01:16:04,332
Right.

2137
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:06,902
We have all come all the way to Ulleung Island.

2138
01:16:07,372 --> 01:16:09,401
Of course, it would be important...

2139
01:16:09,402 --> 01:16:10,641
to learn about different facts about the area,

2140
01:16:10,642 --> 01:16:12,901
but it must be entertaining to the viewers.

2141
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,672
- Right.
- Right. It has to be fun.

2142
01:16:14,712 --> 01:16:18,481
A lot of shocking experiences have been prepared.

2143
01:16:18,482 --> 01:16:19,851
(A lot of shocking experiences have been prepared.)

2144
01:16:19,852 --> 01:16:22,452
What could be shocking? Will we get there on a chug boat?

2145
01:16:26,752 --> 01:16:31,062
(The splendor of Dokdo you cannot take your eyes off of)

2146
01:16:31,862 --> 01:16:37,402
(The glorious sight even feels touching to the heart.)

2147
01:16:38,702 --> 01:16:41,702
(The beautiful sight that guards the end of the East Sea.)

2148
01:16:42,902 --> 01:16:44,902
(It makes everyone clench their fists.)

2149
01:16:46,612 --> 01:16:49,742
(It's not about us today. Dokdo must be filmed well.)

2150
01:16:51,612 --> 01:16:52,641
It's amazing.

2151
01:16:52,642 --> 01:16:56,781
(We are heading to Dokdo.)

2152
01:16:56,782 --> 01:16:58,522
It looks like a painting.

2153
01:16:59,482 --> 01:17:01,791
I have a question for you, Professor Seo.

2154
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:02,851
We surely know that...

2155
01:17:02,852 --> 01:17:04,098
- Dokdo is our territory.
- Right.

2156
01:17:04,122 --> 01:17:06,631
There must be a reason why this must be remembered.

2157
01:17:06,632 --> 01:17:08,631
Right. This is the most important part.

2158
01:17:08,632 --> 01:17:10,531
Since it is our territory,

2159
01:17:10,532 --> 01:17:13,771
we must visit Dokdo ourselves often.

2160
01:17:13,772 --> 01:17:15,671
That is the most important method...

2161
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:17,141
- of protecting our territory.
- Right.

2162
01:17:17,142 --> 01:17:18,571
That is why I decided to visit...

2163
01:17:18,572 --> 01:17:20,342
- with the 2 Days 1 Night team.
- Right.

2164
01:17:20,912 --> 01:17:23,341
- It was to remind everyone...
- That's meaningful.

2165
01:17:23,342 --> 01:17:25,311
Of the true meaning of Dokdo Day.

2166
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:27,311
- That is the plan.
- We're going to Dokdo.

2167
01:17:27,312 --> 01:17:28,751
- First of all, - Yes?

2168
01:17:28,752 --> 01:17:31,181
Why was October 25 chosen to be...

2169
01:17:31,182 --> 01:17:32,381
- Dokdo Day?
- Dokdo Day?

2170
01:17:32,382 --> 01:17:33,791
Right. Why October 25?

2171
01:17:33,792 --> 01:17:35,251
October 25.

2172
01:17:35,252 --> 01:17:37,021
- October 25.
- Right.

2173
01:17:37,022 --> 01:17:38,321
October 25.

2174
01:17:38,322 --> 01:17:39,992
(What could be the reason?)

2175
01:17:40,232 --> 01:17:42,331
- Could we get a hint?
- A hint.

2176
01:17:42,332 --> 01:17:44,702
- A hint?
- A hint will make it obvious.

2177
01:17:44,732 --> 01:17:46,631
Well, first of all...

2178
01:17:46,632 --> 01:17:48,272
- Why was it that day?
- Right.

2179
01:17:49,472 --> 01:17:50,542
Gojong.

2180
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:53,212
- Historian Kim should know this.
- Right.

2181
01:17:53,272 --> 01:17:54,811
- Gojong.
- Right. Gojong.

2182
01:17:54,812 --> 01:17:56,882
- DinDin!
- Yes?

2183
01:17:56,912 --> 01:18:00,712
In "The Veritable Records of King Sejong,"

2184
01:18:00,852 --> 01:18:03,321
October 25 was the first time Dokdo was recorded as our territory.

2185
01:18:03,322 --> 01:18:05,382
We'll get to that a bit later.

2186
01:18:05,752 --> 01:18:07,521
- What? Don't get ahead of yourself.
- Right.

2187
01:18:07,522 --> 01:18:08,991
You went a bit too far off.

2188
01:18:08,992 --> 01:18:10,491
We'll get to that later.

2189
01:18:10,492 --> 01:18:12,462
I have a lot of knowledge based on Dokdo.

2190
01:18:13,092 --> 01:18:17,002
On October 25, 1900,

2191
01:18:17,102 --> 01:18:20,302
Emperor Gojong proclaimed...

2192
01:18:20,402 --> 01:18:23,901
Imperial Decree No. 41 of the Korean Empire.

2193
01:18:23,902 --> 01:18:26,541
That was when Dokdo...

2194
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:28,911
was announced as a related island of Ulleung Island.

2195
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:32,041
- To celebrate that moment, - On October 25.

2196
01:18:32,042 --> 01:18:36,351
A private organization designated that day to be Dokdo Day.

2197
01:18:36,352 --> 01:18:38,681
- October 25.
- So that day was October 25.

2198
01:18:38,682 --> 01:18:39,921
That became Dokdo Day.

2199
01:18:39,922 --> 01:18:41,321
It is said that you see as much as you know...

2200
01:18:41,322 --> 01:18:43,692
and you feel as much as you see.

2201
01:18:43,862 --> 01:18:47,462
We prepared a heartfelt trip...

2202
01:18:47,732 --> 01:18:50,502
so that you can feel a lot closer to Dokdo.

2203
01:18:50,862 --> 01:18:54,272
From now on, it will be Our Dokdo Notes.

2204
01:18:55,132 --> 01:18:57,201
We will start our trip in earnest.

2205
01:18:57,202 --> 01:18:59,171
- I'm excited.
- Gosh.

2206
01:18:59,172 --> 01:19:00,212
(Full of excitement)

2207
01:19:00,642 --> 01:19:02,642
- It's a grand feeling.
- Right.

2208
01:19:02,912 --> 01:19:04,341
(The end of Ulleung Island, the start of Dokdo)

2209
01:19:04,342 --> 01:19:06,281
(The excitement inside of me is starting to bloom.)

2210
01:19:06,282 --> 01:19:09,382
(Se Yoon)

2211
01:19:09,512 --> 01:19:13,051
Gosh, it won't be easy to drive on Ulleung Island.

2212
01:19:13,052 --> 01:19:14,852
- Right. They're all mountain roads.
- Right.

2213
01:19:15,352 --> 01:19:19,191
Since when were you interested in what you do?

2214
01:19:19,192 --> 01:19:22,161
This was what I thought when I was young.

2215
01:19:22,162 --> 01:19:25,102
- "It's our territory."
- Right.

2216
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:28,271
"Why do they keep insisting it's their territory?"

2217
01:19:28,272 --> 01:19:30,441
I questioned...

2218
01:19:30,442 --> 01:19:34,242
their false claims.

2219
01:19:34,542 --> 01:19:37,041
- I'm quite cautious today.
- Okay.

2220
01:19:37,042 --> 01:19:39,381
I wrote a song on Dokdo,

2221
01:19:39,382 --> 01:19:41,052
so I studied a lot on Dokdo.

2222
01:19:41,582 --> 01:19:44,181
- I consider myself a master.
- That's how much you studied?

2223
01:19:44,182 --> 01:19:46,891
- I know a lot about Dokdo.
- I see.

2224
01:19:46,892 --> 01:19:48,721
I'll try to maintain the balance.

2225
01:19:48,722 --> 01:19:50,191
- Okay.
- Okay.

2226
01:19:50,192 --> 01:19:52,921
- Gosh, he's boasting again.
- You might be surprised.

2227
01:19:52,922 --> 01:19:55,861
Then I should test you a bit.

2228
01:19:55,862 --> 01:19:57,361
- Right.
- I'm sure...

2229
01:19:57,362 --> 01:19:58,601
- there will be time for that.
- Right.

2230
01:19:58,602 --> 01:19:59,761
Decide on who is better.

2231
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:00,872
Sure.

2232
01:20:00,972 --> 01:20:02,972
When we have other guests,

2233
01:20:03,202 --> 01:20:05,072
we usually try to take care of them,

2234
01:20:05,202 --> 01:20:07,071
but we'd rather want to rely on Professor Seo.

2235
01:20:07,072 --> 01:20:08,671
Of course. We should learn from him.

2236
01:20:08,672 --> 01:20:10,381
Please tell us everything you know.

2237
01:20:10,382 --> 01:20:12,981
Sure. More importantly, we should have fun.

2238
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:14,111
That would be great.

2239
01:20:14,112 --> 01:20:16,351
I hear he is the honorary ambassador to Ulleung Island.

2240
01:20:16,352 --> 01:20:18,481
He must know a lot of good restaurants.

2241
01:20:18,482 --> 01:20:19,751
Of course, I do.

2242
01:20:19,752 --> 01:20:21,921
If we were to have dinner with you,

2243
01:20:21,922 --> 01:20:23,191
it would be great.

2244
01:20:23,192 --> 01:20:25,291
When you come to Ulleung Island,

2245
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:27,492
what dish do you think you must eat?

2246
01:20:27,632 --> 01:20:29,961
First, I'd like to have...

2247
01:20:29,962 --> 01:20:31,308
Everyone has different personal tastes,

2248
01:20:31,332 --> 01:20:33,301
but I really like seasoned squid and pork belly.

2249
01:20:33,302 --> 01:20:34,848
- Seasoned squid and pork belly?
- I really like it.

2250
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:36,001
You should try it yourself.

2251
01:20:36,002 --> 01:20:37,741
- Because they have good squid here?
- Sure.

2252
01:20:37,742 --> 01:20:38,971
- I see.
- That sounds great.

2253
01:20:38,972 --> 01:20:40,312
It's really good.

2254
01:20:40,872 --> 01:20:42,171
Restaurant? Okay.

2255
01:20:42,172 --> 01:20:43,342
What? Are we eating?

2256
01:20:43,882 --> 01:20:45,211
My gosh, today...

2257
01:20:45,212 --> 01:20:47,372
(It seems like they're doing something before dinner.)

2258
01:20:47,582 --> 01:20:49,702
Professor Seo says this restaurant offers great food.

2259
01:20:50,322 --> 01:20:51,322
(That's true.)

2260
01:20:51,323 --> 01:20:53,421
All right. Before we get into learning...

2261
01:20:53,422 --> 01:20:55,222
about Dokdo,

2262
01:20:55,592 --> 01:20:57,091
eating should come first.

2263
01:20:57,092 --> 01:20:58,721
- Yes!
- That's right!

2264
01:20:58,722 --> 01:21:01,131
This place is said to be famous for its dishes...

2265
01:21:01,132 --> 01:21:02,791
featuring Ulleung Island's specialties,

2266
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:05,801
squid, Amur wallflower, and victory onion.

2267
01:21:05,802 --> 01:21:07,102
(Seasoned squid and pork belly)

2268
01:21:07,302 --> 01:21:09,502
(Pickled victory onion)

2269
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:12,242
(Amur wallflower rice)

2270
01:21:12,572 --> 01:21:14,671
- It must be delicious.
- We have Professor Seo today.

2271
01:21:14,672 --> 01:21:16,881
So, at least today, we don't want...

2272
01:21:16,882 --> 01:21:18,341
to make things too harsh.

2273
01:21:18,342 --> 01:21:19,682
- What?
- What?

2274
01:21:20,052 --> 01:21:21,951
- Seriously?
- So, we will give you dinner.

2275
01:21:21,952 --> 01:21:23,682
- My goodness.
- That's amazing.

2276
01:21:24,182 --> 01:21:25,451
Then...

2277
01:21:25,452 --> 01:21:26,892
It's okay to make things harsh.

2278
01:21:27,422 --> 01:21:28,751
- Why...
- Why would you say that?

2279
01:21:28,752 --> 01:21:29,822
(It should never happen!)

2280
01:21:29,852 --> 01:21:31,691
- However, - So, that's how it goes.

2281
01:21:31,692 --> 01:21:34,392
They have seasoned squid and pork belly on the menu,

2282
01:21:35,092 --> 01:21:37,931
and that will only be served to the professor.

2283
01:21:37,932 --> 01:21:39,131
- What?
- Why?

2284
01:21:39,132 --> 01:21:40,731
- And...
- That's what we have to eat.

2285
01:21:40,732 --> 01:21:42,432
He should be with us.

2286
01:21:42,802 --> 01:21:44,442
Professor Seo should...

2287
01:21:44,672 --> 01:21:46,772
- So...
- We have rules here.

2288
01:21:47,112 --> 01:21:50,441
We are going to select the members who will eat with Professor Seo.

2289
01:21:50,442 --> 01:21:51,981
(The members to join Professor Seo will be selected.)

2290
01:21:51,982 --> 01:21:52,982
- Again?
- Then...

2291
01:21:52,983 --> 01:21:54,011
- So...
- What is going on?

2292
01:21:54,012 --> 01:21:56,012
If this isn't harsh, what is?

2293
01:21:56,252 --> 01:21:58,322
- Aren't I right?
- This is really harsh.

2294
01:21:58,482 --> 01:22:00,391
- Why would we...
- It'd be nice to eat all together.

2295
01:22:00,392 --> 01:22:01,621
- Right?
- Of course.

2296
01:22:01,622 --> 01:22:02,768
(A chance to join Professor Seo for dinner)

2297
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:05,222
So, we prepared some quizzes.

2298
01:22:05,492 --> 01:22:08,032
- We have to solve the quizzes.
- Gosh, quizzes.

2299
01:22:08,092 --> 01:22:11,961
Fascinating and Useful Dokdo Encyclopedia That You Should Know.

2300
01:22:11,962 --> 01:22:13,831
- It's called...
- This is crazy.

2301
01:22:13,832 --> 01:22:15,352
- I'm going to eat everything.
- FUDE.

2302
01:22:15,402 --> 01:22:19,502
Professor Seo will give you eight questions about Dokdo.

2303
01:22:20,542 --> 01:22:23,711
Only the top three members with the most correct answers...

2304
01:22:23,712 --> 01:22:25,641
will be able to eat seasoned squid and pork belly.

2305
01:22:25,642 --> 01:22:28,552
DinDin studied a lot when writing a song about Dokdo.

2306
01:22:28,812 --> 01:22:30,952
Apparently, he read all the books about Dokdo.

2307
01:22:31,122 --> 01:22:33,251
You guys should've studied. Why did you not study?

2308
01:22:33,252 --> 01:22:36,251
- Let's see how it goes.
- All right.

2309
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:37,822
(Looking forward to it)

2310
01:22:37,922 --> 01:22:39,792
I will play fair and square today.

2311
01:22:40,162 --> 01:22:42,131
I can see Professor Seo's laptop now.

2312
01:22:42,132 --> 01:22:43,392
Please turn it a little.

2313
01:22:43,562 --> 01:22:46,002
- I can see what's on his laptop.
- Okay.

2314
01:22:46,132 --> 01:22:47,431
He already saw that.

2315
01:22:47,432 --> 01:22:48,631
- I didn't.
- He saw the answers.

2316
01:22:48,632 --> 01:22:50,371
I swear on Dokdo I didn't see it.

2317
01:22:50,372 --> 01:22:51,471
- I see.
- My goodness.

2318
01:22:51,472 --> 01:22:52,942
How dare you swear on Dokdo?

2319
01:22:53,812 --> 01:22:55,411
Do you think you have the right to do that?

2320
01:22:55,412 --> 01:22:57,042
I'm a citizen of South Korea.

2321
01:22:57,312 --> 01:22:58,312
All right.

2322
01:22:58,313 --> 01:23:00,982
Professor Seo, let me tell you one thing.

2323
01:23:01,382 --> 01:23:02,952
Our knowledge level is at rock bottom.

2324
01:23:03,722 --> 01:23:05,482
- It's horrible.
- Okay.

2325
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:08,251
I carefully chose the questions to match your level.

2326
01:23:08,252 --> 01:23:09,798
- That's not good.
- Then, it's worth a try.

2327
01:23:09,822 --> 01:23:11,862
- That's not good.
- All right.

2328
01:23:11,962 --> 01:23:14,191
- It's doable.
- I want college-level questions.

2329
01:23:14,192 --> 01:23:15,631
You don't have to worry.

2330
01:23:15,632 --> 01:23:16,961
- Okay.
- All right.

2331
01:23:16,962 --> 01:23:19,231
Those who are watching may wonder...

2332
01:23:19,232 --> 01:23:20,831
why we don't know such things,

2333
01:23:20,832 --> 01:23:22,731
- but we'll try our best to learn.
- Right.

2334
01:23:22,732 --> 01:23:24,402
- Of course.
- You're right.

2335
01:23:24,572 --> 01:23:26,072
- Here's the first question.
- Okay.

2336
01:23:26,572 --> 01:23:28,842
Since it's the first question, it is like a warm-up.

2337
01:23:29,072 --> 01:23:32,212
I will give you a really easy question.

2338
01:23:32,342 --> 01:23:35,552
It's a question about Ulleung Island and Dokdo.

2339
01:23:35,712 --> 01:23:37,821
What is the distance between these two islands?

2340
01:23:37,822 --> 01:23:39,182
- DinDin.
- Seon Ho.

2341
01:23:39,352 --> 01:23:42,322
- Seon Ho was faster.
- It's 87.4km.

2342
01:23:43,392 --> 01:23:44,561
(Is it correct?)

2343
01:23:44,562 --> 01:23:47,132
Shouldn't it be accurate down to the decimal point?

2344
01:23:47,232 --> 01:23:49,592
It is correct up to the decimal point.

2345
01:23:50,302 --> 01:23:52,101
- It was written somewhere.
- Right.

2346
01:23:52,102 --> 01:23:53,161
Hang on.

2347
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:55,331
This is just a warm-up.

2348
01:23:55,332 --> 01:23:57,101
- Right. It's a warm-up.
- Okay.

2349
01:23:57,102 --> 01:24:00,371
- So it doesn't count. Okay.
- No.

2350
01:24:00,372 --> 01:24:02,241
(Why are you doing this to me?)

2351
01:24:02,242 --> 01:24:04,581
When we went to the observatory,

2352
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:05,911
it was written there.

2353
01:24:05,912 --> 01:24:07,651
Professor Seo, please make your decision.

2354
01:24:07,652 --> 01:24:10,521
Since everyone wants it...

2355
01:24:10,522 --> 01:24:12,081
They all are my enemies.

2356
01:24:12,082 --> 01:24:14,491
You got it so fast. I was surprised.

2357
01:24:14,492 --> 01:24:16,151
- It's 87.4km.
- We know that much.

2358
01:24:16,152 --> 01:24:18,561
When the weather is nice, you can see Dokdo with the naked eye.

2359
01:24:18,562 --> 01:24:20,431
- Yes.
- That's what's important.

2360
01:24:20,432 --> 01:24:21,491
It's important.

2361
01:24:21,492 --> 01:24:25,131
Unfortunately, you couldn't see it because of the fog today.

2362
01:24:25,132 --> 01:24:26,201
Right. We couldn't see it.

2363
01:24:26,202 --> 01:24:28,672
I'll show you photos...

2364
01:24:28,902 --> 01:24:32,241
of Dokdo that I took myself on a nice day...

2365
01:24:32,242 --> 01:24:34,271
- from Ulleung Island.
- You took photos?

2366
01:24:34,272 --> 01:24:35,341
(A clear image of Dokdo captured on camera)

2367
01:24:35,342 --> 01:24:36,742
- We can see it.
- Yes.

2368
01:24:36,982 --> 01:24:38,981
You've probably heard of the Oki Islands,

2369
01:24:38,982 --> 01:24:40,812
which are often mentioned in Japan.

2370
01:24:41,082 --> 01:24:44,121
It's about 157km away...

2371
01:24:44,122 --> 01:24:45,351
- from Dokdo.
- Right. It's much farther away.

2372
01:24:45,352 --> 01:24:46,851
- It's far.
- From Japan.

2373
01:24:46,852 --> 01:24:48,451
You can never see Dokdo with the naked eye from there.

2374
01:24:48,452 --> 01:24:49,628
(It's too far to see it with the naked eye.)

2375
01:24:49,652 --> 01:24:52,121
This is evidence that Dokdo is...

2376
01:24:52,122 --> 01:24:53,961
an island belonging to Ulleung Island.

2377
01:24:53,962 --> 01:24:55,991
- Exactly.
- Because we can see it.

2378
01:24:55,992 --> 01:24:59,401
The fact that we can see it with the naked eye is important.

2379
01:24:59,402 --> 01:25:00,571
That's really important.

2380
01:25:00,572 --> 01:25:01,601
(Dokdo is our territory, as proven by geographical facts, )

2381
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:02,771
Now, it's the main question, right?

2382
01:25:02,772 --> 01:25:04,101
Yes. It's the main question.

2383
01:25:04,102 --> 01:25:05,801
- Listen carefully.
- But I got it right.

2384
01:25:05,802 --> 01:25:09,242
One of Dokdo's old names...

2385
01:25:09,512 --> 01:25:11,441
- is Gaji Island.
- Gaji Island?

2386
01:25:11,442 --> 01:25:12,711
Yes. Gaji Island.

2387
01:25:12,712 --> 01:25:15,381
This name was given...

2388
01:25:15,382 --> 01:25:17,382
because Dokdo is abundant with these.

2389
01:25:17,482 --> 01:25:19,621
- Guess what this is.
- Seon Ho.

2390
01:25:19,622 --> 01:25:20,852
Seon Ho.

2391
01:25:21,022 --> 01:25:22,452
Is it barnacles?

2392
01:25:23,322 --> 01:25:24,791
No. You're out.

2393
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:26,222
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min.

2394
01:25:27,562 --> 01:25:28,632
Seagulls.

2395
01:25:29,862 --> 01:25:31,431
Even I didn't say that.

2396
01:25:31,432 --> 01:25:33,131
- You're out.
- Okay.

2397
01:25:33,132 --> 01:25:34,632
Lean back.

2398
01:25:34,832 --> 01:25:36,771
- DinDin.
- Se Yoon.

2399
01:25:36,772 --> 01:25:37,901
- DinDin.
- DinDin.

2400
01:25:37,902 --> 01:25:38,942
Eared seals.

2401
01:25:39,502 --> 01:25:41,811
- Oh, eared seals.
- I was going to say that.

2402
01:25:41,812 --> 01:25:43,342
(I knew it too.)

2403
01:25:43,512 --> 01:25:44,812
Correct!

2404
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:46,741
(The answer is eared seals.)

2405
01:25:46,742 --> 01:25:49,652
- I forgot about that.
- Eared seals.

2406
01:25:53,182 --> 01:25:54,291
(When I got to Gaji Island, )

2407
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:55,691
(four or five eared seals jumped up in surprise.)

2408
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:57,012
(They resembled water buffaloes.)

2409
01:25:58,222 --> 01:26:00,762
(Eared seals filmed in 1938)

2410
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:06,861
(Eared seals were so abundant on Dokdo...)

2411
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:09,272
(that the island was called Gaji Island.)

2412
01:26:09,672 --> 01:26:12,702
The thing is, in the early 1900s,

2413
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:15,811
Japan illegally hunted...

2414
01:26:15,812 --> 01:26:18,382
- eared seals on Dokdo.
- Right.

2415
01:26:18,582 --> 01:26:21,652
During that time,

2416
01:26:21,752 --> 01:26:24,521
they caught so many of them...

2417
01:26:24,522 --> 01:26:26,721
- that their population plummeted.
- I see.

2418
01:26:26,722 --> 01:26:31,262
In fact, it's no exaggeration to say that they drove them to extinction.

2419
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:34,331
Of course, they sold the eared seals...

2420
01:26:34,332 --> 01:26:37,461
for financial gain, but that wasn't the only reason.

2421
01:26:37,462 --> 01:26:39,332
They also used them as war materials.

2422
01:26:39,602 --> 01:26:42,671
They used their skin and fat...

2423
01:26:42,672 --> 01:26:45,442
of eared seals for war.

2424
01:26:45,502 --> 01:26:47,772
Actually, I recently...

2425
01:26:48,212 --> 01:26:50,842
- visited Tokyo.
- Okay.

2426
01:26:51,142 --> 01:26:53,952
There's a museum called Territory and Sovereignty Exhibition Hall.

2427
01:26:54,382 --> 01:26:56,781
It is to falsely claim...

2428
01:26:56,782 --> 01:26:59,452
that the island is their territory.

2429
01:26:59,752 --> 01:27:02,692
They are the ones who drove eared seals to extinction.

2430
01:27:03,022 --> 01:27:05,222
But they have stuffed eared seals there.

2431
01:27:05,992 --> 01:27:07,731
- In the museum?
- Yes. And...

2432
01:27:07,732 --> 01:27:10,862
they created various eared seal characters...

2433
01:27:11,062 --> 01:27:14,332
so children could learn about Dokdo.

2434
01:27:14,532 --> 01:27:17,142
- For the purpose of education.
- To educate them.

2435
01:27:17,502 --> 01:27:19,801
After driving eared seals to extinction,

2436
01:27:19,802 --> 01:27:22,171
they revived them in such a way...

2437
01:27:22,172 --> 01:27:24,411
to distort history.

2438
01:27:24,412 --> 01:27:26,811
I found it very upsetting.

2439
01:27:26,812 --> 01:27:30,111
Actually, the government is...

2440
01:27:30,112 --> 01:27:34,251
currently working to restore the eared seals now,

2441
01:27:34,252 --> 01:27:36,951
but with no living seals remaining,

2442
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:38,661
restoration is challenging.

2443
01:27:38,662 --> 01:27:40,931
- Right.
- However, if we successfully...

2444
01:27:40,932 --> 01:27:42,961
turn the eared seals...

2445
01:27:42,962 --> 01:27:45,101
into a symbol of Dokdo,

2446
01:27:45,102 --> 01:27:47,431
I believe they could become...

2447
01:27:47,432 --> 01:27:49,201
a valuable icon,

2448
01:27:49,202 --> 01:27:52,442
- further promoting Dokdo.
- Right.

2449
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:57,942
(Remembering eared seals is the beginning of protecting Dokdo.)

2450
01:27:58,582 --> 01:27:59,611
This is really fun.

2451
01:27:59,612 --> 01:28:01,812
Learning is really fun.

2452
01:28:02,712 --> 01:28:04,751
You got the questions right very quickly.

2453
01:28:04,752 --> 01:28:05,951
This is how good we are.

2454
01:28:05,952 --> 01:28:07,991
I think you can raise the level of the questions a bit.

2455
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:09,752
So, you got one question right.

2456
01:28:10,152 --> 01:28:11,261
Take it easy.

2457
01:28:11,262 --> 01:28:13,222
Shouldn't you check Lee Joon's microphone?

2458
01:28:13,962 --> 01:28:15,561
Say something.

2459
01:28:15,562 --> 01:28:16,562
(Putting himself on mute)

2460
01:28:16,563 --> 01:28:18,731
Say "Eared seals."

2461
01:28:18,732 --> 01:28:20,801
I raised my hand, but I was late.

2462
01:28:20,802 --> 01:28:21,872
You raised your hand?

2463
01:28:22,132 --> 01:28:25,102
(He did try raising his hand.)

2464
01:28:25,172 --> 01:28:27,442
(But he was too late.)

2465
01:28:27,512 --> 01:28:29,111
- All right.
- Okay.

2466
01:28:29,112 --> 01:28:30,941
So we've solved two questions.

2467
01:28:30,942 --> 01:28:33,211
- Now we have 6 questions left.
- We have 6 questions?

2468
01:28:33,212 --> 01:28:35,151
- What is it?
- This is too fast.

2469
01:28:35,152 --> 01:28:36,781
The six questions...

2470
01:28:36,782 --> 01:28:39,752
You should hurry with this question.

2471
01:28:40,282 --> 01:28:41,891
Then it means...

2472
01:28:41,892 --> 01:28:43,961
You've heard of "History of the Three Kingdoms," right?

2473
01:28:43,962 --> 01:28:45,362
Darn it. I can't answer it.

2474
01:28:46,122 --> 01:28:49,061
- I'm not good at it.
- I didn't study it.

2475
01:28:49,062 --> 01:28:50,862
According to "History of the Three Kingdoms,"

2476
01:28:51,332 --> 01:28:54,802
Dokdo is said to have been first conquered...

2477
01:28:55,602 --> 01:28:57,132
by this person...

2478
01:28:57,802 --> 01:29:02,171
during the reign of King Jijeung of Silla in 512 as Usanguk.

2479
01:29:02,172 --> 01:29:03,641
Usanguk? Right. It was called Usanguk.

2480
01:29:03,642 --> 01:29:05,412
I think I saw it on YouTube.

2481
01:29:05,612 --> 01:29:08,151
Who was this person...

2482
01:29:08,152 --> 01:29:10,311
- Who is it?
- who first incorporated Usanguk...

2483
01:29:10,312 --> 01:29:13,451
into Korean history and developed maritime territory?

2484
01:29:13,452 --> 01:29:15,122
- Silla?
- Jong Min.

2485
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:16,452
Yes.

2486
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:20,192
(Is Historian Kim finally stepping up?)

2487
01:29:21,292 --> 01:29:22,332
Queen Seondeok?

2488
01:29:23,962 --> 01:29:25,031
Queen Seondeok?

2489
01:29:25,032 --> 01:29:26,992
(I said it was during the reign of King Jijeung.)

2490
01:29:27,502 --> 01:29:28,871
- You're out.
- Okay.

2491
01:29:28,872 --> 01:29:30,642
- Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho.

2492
01:29:31,172 --> 01:29:33,072
I think he was...

2493
01:29:33,202 --> 01:29:35,172
- a maritime general.
- Yes!

2494
01:29:35,272 --> 01:29:36,342
Jang Bo Go.

2495
01:29:37,982 --> 01:29:39,441
- Wrong.
- Seon Ho.

2496
01:29:39,442 --> 01:29:40,612
Yes, Seon Ho.

2497
01:29:40,782 --> 01:29:41,982
Gwanggaeto the Great.

2498
01:29:42,612 --> 01:29:43,711
Hey!

2499
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:45,282
He was the king of Goguryeo.

2500
01:29:46,052 --> 01:29:47,082
That's so...

2501
01:29:47,422 --> 01:29:49,251
- Professor, this is who we are.
- That's...

2502
01:29:49,252 --> 01:29:50,791
You guys must know...

2503
01:29:50,792 --> 01:29:52,622
the song, "Dokdo Is Our Land."

2504
01:29:53,392 --> 01:29:54,992
You all know the song.

2505
01:29:55,762 --> 01:29:57,662
Why don't you try singing it?

2506
01:29:58,132 --> 01:30:01,532
(A lonely island, the home of birds)

2507
01:30:01,702 --> 01:30:03,502
Kim Yu Sin who beheaded his horse.

2508
01:30:04,572 --> 01:30:07,102
Why would you mention a beheaded horse here?

2509
01:30:08,342 --> 01:30:11,081
(The answer is in the song.)

2510
01:30:11,082 --> 01:30:14,512
(If you insist, that's a big problem)

2511
01:30:16,412 --> 01:30:18,352
(Laughing in the underground)

2512
01:30:19,182 --> 01:30:21,652
(Who laughed in the underground?)

2513
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:23,451
- Jong Min!
- Gwan Chang.

2514
01:30:23,452 --> 01:30:24,592
It's a general, right?

2515
01:30:26,092 --> 01:30:27,121
Yes!

2516
01:30:27,122 --> 01:30:28,232
(Yes, him!)

2517
01:30:28,792 --> 01:30:31,262
(What is Historian Kim's answer?)

2518
01:30:31,532 --> 01:30:33,102
Silla general Yisabu.

2519
01:30:33,602 --> 01:30:35,902
- Silla general Yisabu. Yes, right.
- He's right.

2520
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:37,302
Correct!

2521
01:30:38,702 --> 01:30:40,542
(Impressed)

2522
01:30:40,672 --> 01:30:43,311
If you sing the whole song...

2523
01:30:43,312 --> 01:30:44,481
- Right now...
- He sang it.

2524
01:30:44,482 --> 01:30:45,541
Sing it, then.

2525
01:30:45,542 --> 01:30:48,382
(Silla general Yisabu, laughing in the underground)

2526
01:30:48,512 --> 01:30:50,251
(Dokdo is our land)

2527
01:30:50,252 --> 01:30:51,621
Let's sing it later.

2528
01:30:51,622 --> 01:30:53,121
Okay.

2529
01:30:53,122 --> 01:30:55,091
(We believed in you, Historian Kim.)

2530
01:30:55,092 --> 01:30:59,222
General Yisabu was the first person in Korea's history...

2531
01:30:59,322 --> 01:31:01,831
to include Usanguk in our territory.

2532
01:31:01,832 --> 01:31:03,731
Usanguk refers to...

2533
01:31:03,732 --> 01:31:06,062
Ulleung Island and Dokdo.

2534
01:31:06,202 --> 01:31:10,571
Remember him as the first person to conquer...

2535
01:31:10,572 --> 01:31:12,971
the territories at sea.

2536
01:31:12,972 --> 01:31:15,972
I think that would be pretty nice.

2537
01:31:17,582 --> 01:31:19,411
(The Usanguk people are fierce and hard to conquer by force, )

2538
01:31:19,412 --> 01:31:21,281
(so it would be better to use a ploy.)

2539
01:31:21,282 --> 01:31:23,442
(The Chronicles of the Three States, Yisabu's Records)

2540
01:31:23,752 --> 01:31:28,622
(Yisabu's plan was to threaten them with wooden lions.)

2541
01:31:29,922 --> 01:31:34,032
(He managed to subdue Usanguk without bloodshed.)

2542
01:31:34,692 --> 01:31:36,191
(Yisabu's record of taking over Usanguk...)

2543
01:31:36,192 --> 01:31:37,961
(is the most important piece of proof...)

2544
01:31:37,962 --> 01:31:40,232
(with which we claim sovereignty over the territory.)

2545
01:31:40,362 --> 01:31:44,202
You answered three questions.

2546
01:31:44,342 --> 01:31:45,801
- As you can see, - There are three left?

2547
01:31:45,802 --> 01:31:49,642
There's one word, a keyword, isn't there?

2548
01:31:50,012 --> 01:31:51,911
- There's a keyword.
- A keyword?

2549
01:31:51,912 --> 01:31:53,942
- "Distance."
- "Distance."

2550
01:31:54,012 --> 01:31:55,481
Then there was "Eared seal."

2551
01:31:55,482 --> 01:31:57,282
- "Eared seal." "Yisabu."
- "Yisabu."

2552
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:59,651
I'm using those keywords...

2553
01:31:59,652 --> 01:32:02,091
- to relay a message.
- Okay.

2554
01:32:02,092 --> 01:32:04,321
- Keep that in mind.
- Let's go!

2555
01:32:04,322 --> 01:32:06,961
That might make the quiz more educational.

2556
01:32:06,962 --> 01:32:08,792
(Next episode)

2557
01:32:09,432 --> 01:32:13,432
(Only awed exclamations fill the space.)

2558
01:32:13,962 --> 01:32:16,371
(We face our territory at last.)

2559
01:32:16,372 --> 01:32:18,972
(Dokdo)

2560
01:32:19,342 --> 01:32:21,812
- It's so amazing.
- It's really something.

2561
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:25,411
(They look in a silent trance...)

2562
01:32:25,412 --> 01:32:28,552
(at the beautiful island.)

2563
01:32:29,012 --> 01:32:31,782
(We invite you to this incredible place.)

2564
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:35,921
(The easternmost point of the Republic of Korea, )

2565
01:32:35,922 --> 01:32:38,062
(Dokdo)

2566
01:32:38,592 --> 01:32:40,621
(Everything you look at...)

2567
01:32:40,622 --> 01:32:42,792
(shines like a special present.)

2568
01:32:43,062 --> 01:32:47,202
(If you brave the slightly turbulent waters, )

2569
01:32:47,832 --> 01:32:50,432
(the Korean flag Taegukgi welcomes you.)

2570
01:32:51,172 --> 01:32:54,272
(Where abundant natural life resides)

2571
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:58,282
(Dokdo is our precious island.)

2572
01:32:59,112 --> 01:33:02,112
(The second story, Our Dokdo Notes)

2573
01:33:02,352 --> 01:33:07,282
- 2 Days 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

2574
01:33:07,382 --> 01:33:08,992
(See you next week.)
