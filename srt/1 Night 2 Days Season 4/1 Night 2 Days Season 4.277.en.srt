1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,310
- Everyone. This time,
- I'm so mad

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,040
- Is it...
- the song is from the 2000s.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
- Okay. Great.
- Okay.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,710
- We got this.
- If we win this round,

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,250
we'll sleep indoors. Let's go.

6
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,750
- Let's...
- Check out the song.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,790
- I got it.
- Okay.

8
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,850
- I got it.
- I got it.

9
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,050
Three,

10
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,160
- two,
- What aren't you answering?

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
- Do you not know what it is?
- one.

12
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,590
- He just called for it.
- You're out of time.

13
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,460
I got it.
"Love and Remember" by god.

14
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
Correct.

15
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,200
- Correct.
- Joon is great today.

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,500
(The king of excitement
has descended.)

17
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,900
- I listened to it this morning.
- Joon is having fun today.

18
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,200
He's on a roll today.

19
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,110
What is this?

20
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,310
(The performance of god
in January of 2000)

21
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,440
(He nails the vibe from 2000.)

22
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,680
He's having too much fun.

23
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,210
- For you
- You're feeling great today.

24
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,580
("Love and Remember" by god)

25
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,010
(It ranked 1st place for 2 weeks
in January of 2000.)

26
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,010
Let's lip-sync.

27
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,690
(You must be happy)

28
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,450
- Gosh, we have a shot.
- Yes.

29
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,660
- Did you know the song?
- No, I didn't.

30
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,460
(It doesn't look like
they have a shot.)

31
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,760
- All right.
- Let's check out the song.

32
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,500
- I got it.
- I got it.

33
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,900
No, Se Yoon was faster.

34
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,230
- It's possible.
- Ready or not...

35
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,400
- It's Hong Kyung Min's song.
- Okay.

36
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,230
"Shaky Friendship."

37
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,570
- Gosh, how did you know?
- Oh, my.

38
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,840
- Right.
- Correct.

39
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,270
My gosh.

40
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,870
(My friend)

41
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,480
("Shaky Friendship"
by Hong Kyung Min)

42
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,610
(It ranked 1st place for 2 weeks
in September of 2000.)

43
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,710
(The men born in the 1980s
explode in excitement.)

44
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,880
- You don't know the song, do you?
- I know this song.

45
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,150
- I see.
- I recognize the melody.

46
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,150
(I guess our friendship
isn't strong enough)

47
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,790
(My friend, cut me some slack)

48
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,930
(For almost letting
our friendship go)

49
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,030
My gosh. Joon is having a blast.

50
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,130
(The song stops playing.)

51
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,960
I'll play the next song
a little longer.

52
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,160
- I'll play the next one longer.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

53
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,730
- Could you do that here?
- Okay.

54
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,770
Joon, I'll take you
to a coin karaoke next week.

55
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,870
- My gosh.
- Each team has three people left.

56
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,870
- It was the 2000s.
- All right.

57
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,310
- I'm struggling with the 2000s.
- Same here.

58
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,740
- Let's go.
- What?

59
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,910
- Play...
- They're fast.

60
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,410
the next song.

61
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,550
- I got it.
- I got it.

62
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,550
- Jong Min.
- I got it.

63
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,320
- You don't know the song, right?
- Hurry.

64
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,580
- Three,
- It's Jo Sung Mo's song.

65
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,720
- He'll know for sure. That's it.
- "Do You Know."

66
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,620
- Correct.
- That's it.

67
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,190
- Lip-sync the song.
- Why

68
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,160
("Do You Know" by Jo Sung Mo)

69
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,130
(It ranked 1st place for 3 weeks
in September of 2000.)

70
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,660
(Sorrowful)

71
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,630
(A mega hit song of Jo Sung Mo,
the crown prince of ballad songs)

72
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,370
(He even brings back
the green plum drink commercial.)

73
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,150
(The guy who's not done having fun
shows up again.)

74
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,620
(Film only me.)

75
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,680
(Remain clueless)

76
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,690
"Remember."

77
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,360
(Remember us just like you do now)

78
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,490
- He's good.
- My gosh, hey.

79
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,230
- "And me."
- "And me."

80
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,070
(He even tears up
for the performance.)

81
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,300
Great.

82
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
- Great.
- Good.

83
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,570
(The end of Joon's "Do You Know")

84
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,740
He even showed us some tears.

85
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,310
- All right. Let's begin.
- Let's do this.

86
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,110
Play the next song.

87
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,610
(What is the next song
that will play next?)

88
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,610
- There it is.
- This is so easy.

89
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,650
- I got it.
- Yes.

90
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,650
- DinDin.
- I figured it out too.

91
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
- Three.
- It's by Turtles.
- My gosh.
- "Airplane."

92
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
- Gosh.
- Wait. That's not it?

93
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,180
Wrong!

94
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,450
- Gastroscopy. Enteroscopy.
- I got it.

95
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,350
- Darn it.
- "Squid Alien" by Eagle Five.

96
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,890
- Wrong.
- That's not it?

97
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,460
- Can we listen to it?
- Would you like to listen to it?

98
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,230
- Okay. Let's listen to it.
- Gastroscopy. Enteroscopy.

99
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,530
Be quiet.

100
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,330
- I got it.
- This is so easy.

101
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,700
- Gastroscopy. Enteroscopy.
- Gosh.

102
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,070
- "Cinderella" by Seo In Young!
- That little...

103
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,270
- Wrong.
- I got it.
I got it.

104
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,440
(What is Joon doing all by himself?)

105
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,910
- I got it.
- I got it.

106
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,080
They don't recognize this song?

107
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,680
They don't know this song?
Look what I'm doing.

108
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,450
(What is the song that comes to mind
based on this dance move?)

109
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,150
(It was called the ET dance move
with two fingertips touching.)

110
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,920
(It's "One More Time" by Jewelry.)

111
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,660
(It ranked 1st place
for 7 weeks in 2008.)

112
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,090
- Yes. Go ahead. Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho.

113
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,230
"One More Time" by Jewelry.

114
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,700
- No, the title is wrong.
- Right.

115
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,060
("One More Time" by Jewelry)

116
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,300
- No, it's correct.
- Correct.

117
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,570
Isn't it "Baby One More Time?"

118
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,870
(If it's not, I'll just dance.)

119
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,000
- Isn't it "Baby One More Time?"
- One more time

120
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,440
(Everyone dances in sync.)

121
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,610
Gosh, what is that?

122
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,910
(Swinging)

123
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,580
(He's good.)

124
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,820
(Laughing)

125
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,920
- My gosh.
- "Baby One More Time?"

126
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,580
Gosh, that was so easy.

127
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,590
Hey, I gave you a hint.
Gastroscopy. Enteroscopy.

128
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,620
I didn't get it.
What was that about?

129
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,420
Gastroscopy. Enteroscopy.
They meet in the middle.

130
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,060
- I'll play the next song now.
- That's...

131
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,230
- That was so easy.
- Play...

132
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,390
- Right?
- the next song.

133
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,400
There it is!

134
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,070
(Is he dancing salsa or samba?)

135
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,200
- I got it.
- Sae Ho.

136
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,800
"Dash" by Baek Z Young.

137
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,670
- Correct.
- That's it. Let's go.

138
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,910
(His wild dancing is back!)

139
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,380
Jong Min. Let's go, come on.

140
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,380
("Dash" by Baek Z Young)
(It ranked 1st place for 2 weeks
in June of 2000.)

141
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,550
(A triple stack is assembled.)

142
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,420
(A dance-filled night in Yeosu)

143
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,990
(Turning off the power)

144
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,390
You didn't know the song, right?

145
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,530
- Well, I would've known...
- I would've known.

146
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,700
- had I listened to it more.
- All right.

147
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,600
I would've known
had we listened to the singing part.

148
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,030
If Team Sang Yi gets this one,

149
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,400
- this round is over.
- Gosh, there's one left.

150
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,870
- All right.
- We'll go to the 1990s next.

151
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,040
- We have to listen to the song.
- If we win this round,

152
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,140
we can win the whole thing.

153
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,340
- Play...
- It's the momentum.

154
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,410
- the next song.
- DinDin isn't good at this.

155
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,540
- I got it.
- There it is.

156
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,580
- I got it.
- That signature line...

157
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,580
- shows up in so many songs.
- I got it.
- DinDin was faster.
- I was faster.

158
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,710
- What will you do then?
- He was faster.

159
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,750
Brave sound

160
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,980
- Three,
- Hold on.

161
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,980
- Take a guess.
- two,

162
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,450
- "Crazy" by Son Dam Bi.
- one.

163
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,450
I got it.

164
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,850
- Wrong.
- I got it.

165
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,720
Sang Yi. It's his turn.

166
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,520
- That shows up in so many songs.
- Right.

167
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,720
- It's Son Dam Bi's song.
- Son Dam Bi.

168
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,230
- "On a Saturday Night."
- That's good.

169
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,660
All right. Let's go.

170
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,930
- I got it.
- Let's listen to his answer too.

171
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,060
- Listen to his answer.
- Listen to it?

172
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,570
- Bo Gum.
- What's your answer then?

173
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,970
"How Come" by Brown Eyed Girls.

174
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,270
- "How Come." Okay.
- My gosh.

175
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,540
- Their answers sound right.
- That must be it.

176
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,670
- They all sound right.
- Did one of them get it right?

177
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,070
("How Come"
versus "On a Saturday Night")

178
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,110
(This is Sang Yi's answer.)

179
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,410
(This is Bo Gum's answer.)

180
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,450
(Both of the songs begin
with "Brave Sound.")

181
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,580
(Did Sang Yi get it right?
Or did Bo Gum get it right?)

182
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,650
(What is the song
the staff prepared?)

183
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,920
That shows up in so many songs.

184
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,460
- "On a Saturday Night."
- Sang Yi is correct.

185
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,890
(Sang Yi gets it right)

186
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,960
Oh, no!

187
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,890
What?

188
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,990
Sang Yi is correct.

189
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,060
(Oh, no!)

190
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,200
What?

191
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,900
- We only knew the signature line.
- My broken heart

192
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,070
("On a Saturday Night"
by Son Dam Bi)

193
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,200
(It ranked 1st place for 2 weeks
in April of 2009.)

194
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,970
- That's it. Seon Ho, you got it.
- This is it.

195
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,880
(Body roll)

196
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,280
That's it. Seon Ho, you got it.

197
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,780
(He perfectly pulls off
Son Dam Bi's signature dance.)

198
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,880
That's it, Seon Ho.

199
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,520
(The mash-up of
"On a Saturday Night" and "Crazy")

200
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,750
- That's it.
- That's for "Crazy."

201
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,820
- That's for "Crazy."
- He's so cute.

202
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,020
- My gosh.
- With that,

203
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,460
- the score is 1 to 1.
- Yes!

204
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,160
- Let's keep going.
- That shows up in so many songs.

205
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,630
- You saved this game.
- Seriously.

206
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,900
- That was amazing.
- Gosh.

207
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,270
- My gosh.
- You saved it.

208
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,270
Seriously.

209
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,240
"How Come" was a nice try, though.

210
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,570
- It was a nice try.
- What a pity.

211
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,410
(The night in Yeosu deepens.)

212
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,880
(Which team
will get to sleep in this tent?)

213
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,980
(Who will get to experience sleeping
outdoors for the first time?)

214
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,580
- If we win, we'll sleep indoors.
- Let's go with the 1970s.

215
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,550
Right.
The team that loses this round...

216
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,320
will sleep outdoors.

217
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,620
"They will sleep outdoors."

218
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,630
So it all comes down to this round.
If you know, go for it right away.

219
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,230
- If you know, go for it.
- You won't do it?

220
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,290
- Seriously.
- Yes.

221
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,730
It's Fin.K.L's song.

222
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,260
- "To My Boyfriend."
- Yes, that's the one.

223
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,230
It goes like this. "Hey, look at me"

224
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,330
- "Tell me I'm pretty"
- That's it.

225
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,470
- That's it.
- Correct.

226
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,270
- Correct.
- Okay.

227
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,740
"Magnetic" by ILLIT.

228
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,810
(Team Bo Gum answers
3 questions in a row.)

229
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,780
You

230
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,480
- Magnetic
- Correct.

231
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,350
(Well done, Team.)

232
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,480
(We're losing,
but we should still dance.)

233
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,820
Hey, he knows all the choreography.

234
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,920
(A cute...)

235
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,390
(pair)

236
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,690
(Sang Yi,
this isn't the time to dance.)

237
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,930
(Team Sang Yi still has
4 members remaining.)

238
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,500
(Team Bo Gum has
only 1 member remaining.)

239
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,400
(The 1-on-4 battle is on.)

240
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,600
Bo Gum is
the only one remaining now.

241
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,000
- He's the weakest link.
- But...

242
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
(They start to get worried.)

243
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,970
Is that your designated seat?
How come you're always in your seat?

244
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,740
- I'm sorry.
- That's not your designated seat.

245
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,780
- It's not.
- What's going on?

246
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,240
- I'm sorry.
- Right. This is...

247
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,450
- It'd be crazy if we lose this.
- Okay.

248
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,180
- Hey, let's turn the tables around.
- Okay.

249
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,420
- Let's do this.
- You can do this, Bo Gum.

250
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,450
- Okay.
- Let's go, Bo Gum.

251
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,990
- Let's...
- Check out the song.

252
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,390
There it is!

253
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,820
(What?)

254
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,690
- I got it.
- Me!

255
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,760
- I got it.
- What is it?

256
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Sae Ho will go first. Two...

257
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,560
- "Twist King" by Turbo.
- That's it.

258
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
Correct.
(In a tight spot)

259
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,330
("Twist King" by Turbo)

260
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,100
(It ranked 1st place for 3 weeks
in September of 1996.)

261
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,500
- Did I get it right?
- Yes.

262
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,810
(Sang Yi goes to Bo Gum
and dances with him...)

263
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,210
(to cheer him up.)

264
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,910
Hey, we can totally win this.
We can turn the tables around.

265
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,450
Bo Gum, if you stay there longer,
you'll end up catching a carp.

266
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,150
- Okay. I'll do better.
- Okay.

267
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,720
- If you cheat...
- All right.

268
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,120
- Play the next song.
- Okay.

269
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,620
(It's 1 against 3 now.
What song will play next?)

270
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,220
- My gosh. This song...
- I got it.

271
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,960
"Traffic Light" by Lee Mu Jin.

272
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,260
- What?
- What did you say?

273
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,500
- Correct.
- Okay.

274
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,330
("Traffic Light" by Lee Mu Jin)

275
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,940
(It ranked 1st place
in September of 2021.)

276
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,910
(It's a green light,
suitable for dancing.)

277
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,010
(Hopping)

278
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,480
(Floundering)

279
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,380
(Jumping)

280
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,450
(Bo Gum is our lucky charm.)

281
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,450
It's over.

282
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,020
(Sang Yi steps out
as he names the song right.)

283
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,350
- Great. It's 2 against 1.
- Bo Gum.

284
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,390
- Gosh, we can do this.
- Bo Gum.

285
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,420
- Let's go. We can do this.
- Yes!

286
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,150
- That was a recent song.
- Bo Gum.

287
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,020
Focus.

288
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,060
- Play...
- We must end it here.

289
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,060
(Bo Gum versus Jong Min and Joon)
the next song.

290
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,190
- I got it.
- Okay.

291
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,830
This is so easy.

292
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,130
- "Tell Me" by Jinusean.
- Three...

293
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,400
("Tell Me" by Jinusean)

294
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
- I knew it too.
- Correct.

295
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,440
- Hold on. We need to strategize.
- All right.

296
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
- A timeout.
- A timeout.

297
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,740
Hold on. Could you come here?

298
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,810
Come here. Let's all squat down.

299
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,680
- What's going on with you?
- What do we do?

300
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,240
- Are you...
- Do you want attention?

301
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,310
- Or...
- No, not at all.

302
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,810
Are you allergic...

303
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,880
- to indoor ticks?
- No.

304
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,020
- No. I can beat Joon.
- If we lose this one, it's over.

305
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,280
- I think I can beat Joon.
- Really?

306
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
I think I can beat him.

307
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,890
Okay. He said
he could at least beat Joon.

308
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,320
- If we lose this one, it's over.
- Let's continue the momentum.

309
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,820
- Joon. Continue the momentum.
- My gosh.

310
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,090
(Bo Gum and Joon are so nervous
that their heart might explode.)

311
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,330
- Forget it. I don't know...
- You know what? Bo Gum...

312
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,330
- any song from the 2020s.
- must be more nervous than you.

313
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,260
No. Joon doesn't know many songs
from the 2020s.

314
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,370
- I really don't.
- Is the next song from the 2020s?

315
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,800
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Jong Min, feel it.

316
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
- All right.
- Gosh, seriously.

317
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,340
(Checking his heart)

318
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,270
- Hey, Bo Gum is so nervous.
- It's beating fast, right?

319
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,540
- You know what?
- Really?

320
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,240
He's under so much pressure.

321
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,110
Both of you, stay focused.

322
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,910
- Please.
- Play the song.

323
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,080
- I got it.
- I got it.

324
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,480
- Bo Gum.
- Bo Gum.

325
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,080
- Bo Gum.
- Go away.

326
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,390
- You're about to tell him.
- What are you doing?

327
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,620
(He stays super focused
in the midst of chaos.)

328
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,620
- Go away.
- I didn't tell him anything.

329
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,760
- Go away.
- Three...

330
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,360
It's a song by BTS.

331
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,190
"Boy With Luv."

332
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,530
("Boy With Luv" by BTS)

333
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,300
- Is it right?
- I think it's right.

334
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,500
("Boy With Luv" by BTS)

335
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,800
- Correct.
- Yes!

336
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,970
Bo Gum!
- It's right.
- I think it's right.

337
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:32,970
- Correct.
- Yes!

338
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,940
(Bo Gum gets it right!)

339
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,970
- I was so nervous.
- You did it.

340
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,340
I can't even remember the dance.

341
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,540
("Boy With Luv" by BTS)

342
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,550
How did it go?

343
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,550
- Doesn't it go like this?
- Is that it?

344
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,780
- I don't know.
- That's it?

345
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,450
(It seems he's still nervous.)

346
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,550
- We did it.
- We won.

347
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,350
Gosh, he did it.

348
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,090
- This shows he's born to be a star.
- My gosh.

349
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,520
- He kept us on our toes to the end.
- My gosh.

350
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,560
- That was crazy.
- My gosh.

351
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,990
Here's the result
of Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

352
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,160
- We did it.
- Okay.

353
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,830
- Team Bo Gum will sleep indoors.
- We won everything.

354
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,500
Team Sang Yi will sleep outdoors.

355
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,230
- Well done.
- My gosh.

356
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,400
- I'm sorry.
- Well done.

357
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,370
- It was really nerve-racking.
- He was under a lot of pressure.

358
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,840
(Team Sang Yi will sleep outdoors.)

359
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,270
(Out of energy)

360
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,510
And...

361
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,880
I have a suggestion.

362
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,250
- What is it?
- Why don't we let...

363
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,750
Sae Ho sleep indoors?

364
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,750
- I'm sorry.
- Then...

365
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,790
(I'm sorry.)

366
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,290
(Laughing)

367
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,320
Okay. I got it.

368
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,620
- If you let me sleep indoors today,
- Yes.

369
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,430
- I'll sleep outdoors...
- Yes.

370
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,830
the next time I win
Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

371
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,490
Then someone should switch with you.

372
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,200
- Someone must help you out.
- Well...

373
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,960
- No. That's not right.
- Bo Gum should sleep indoors.

374
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,800
If Bo Gum switches with me,

375
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,640
I can't stay in Korea
for three years.

376
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
(Laughing)

377
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,070
- Why?
- No, if you go abroad...

378
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,710
- You should hug one of us.
- Okay.

379
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,580
- All of us want to help him out.
- Right.

380
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,410
- It rained a lot.
- Cheol.

381
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,080
- What?
- What's going on?

382
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,980
(Sang Yi blurts out a name
after observing the situation.)

383
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,480
(What?)

384
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,990
- What?
- What's going on?

385
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,220
- He wants to sleep with his peer.
- Hey.

386
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,290
He wants to sleep with his peer.

387
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,590
- Sang Yi suddenly called him.
- Yes.

388
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,960
That's odd. It came out of nowhere.

389
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,990
- Should Sang Yi pick someone?
- Yes.

390
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,460
Why don't we just go camping
another day?

391
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,000
Why now?

392
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,730
Should the guest pick someone?

393
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,100
- Why? We can meet up later.
- Okay.

394
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,130
- Then...
- All right.

395
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,540
- Sang Yi.
- Seriously.

396
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,940
- Sang Yi. I think...
- No. He doesn't want to do it. Why?

397
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,540
- Are you guys close?
- So...

398
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,010
We've gotten close.

399
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,610
- I was going to pick myself.
- Close your eyes!

400
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,150
- We have guests today.
- Close your eyes.

401
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,180
- We should let him pick.
- Right.

402
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,710
- He should get special treatment.
- This...

403
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,250
- Close your eyes.
- This is funny.

404
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,620
Well, we have guests
joining us this week.

405
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,820
- Close your eyes.
- I snore a lot.

406
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,520
- My snoring is like...
- Close your eyes.

407
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,490
Seriously.
I'm going to punch you in the chin.

408
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,890
- You...
- He'll punch Sang Yi in the chin.

409
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,390
I'll really do it. I'm serious.

410
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,800
I think he hugged someone.

411
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
He did?

412
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,500
(Who did Sang Yi pick?)

413
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,170
I think he hugged someone.

414
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,740
He did?
(Peeking through half-opened eyes)

415
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,940
DinDin is chosen.

416
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,040
(DinDin will sleep outdoors.)

417
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,280
Come here, Sae Ho. Join us.

418
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,910
Come here.

419
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,050
What's wrong with you?
Why did you pick me?

420
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,850
- You know what?
- What's wrong with you?

421
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,450
- I'll switch with you another day.
- Yes.

422
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,880
Why did you pick me?

423
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,550
This is fun.

424
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,120
(The 1st encounter
of these 2 peers was awkward.)

425
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,390
(Sit next to him.
He's the same age.)

426
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,800
(As they were shy around each other,
it wasn't easy.)

427
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,970
- Are you going to cheat?
- What? No.

428
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:24,110
(The two of them became close
as they bickered at each other.)

429
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,510
Join our tent.

430
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,920
- My gosh.
- In place of Sae Ho,

431
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,390
DinDin will sleep outdoors.

432
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,420
But the next time DinDin
has to sleep outdoors,

433
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,460
- Sae Ho will switch, right?
- Yes, anytime.

434
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
Great job today, everyone.

435
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,690
- Good work.
- Good work.

436
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,860
- Good work.
- Sleep tight.

437
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Good job.

438
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
This is fun.

439
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,000
- You two look great together.
- Yes.

440
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
- You look good together.
- Hey.

441
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,770
You guys should do a high-five
for the slate clap.

442
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,210
- Do a high-five.
- You two are the same age.

443
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,770
One, two, three.

444
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,510
(We hope
you guys bond more tonight.)

445
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,710
What a lovely sight.

446
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,310
You know that DinDin gives
good massages when going to sleep.

447
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,880
(The night in Yeosu is
coming to an end.)

448
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,120
We need to cut some slack
for the mosquitoes.

449
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,250
They're sucking a lot of blood.

450
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,420
(Bo Gum took a shower upstairs.)

451
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,660
That's amazing.

452
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,760
(This handsome guy's hobby
is doing a face mask.)

453
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,960
The face mask can cover...

454
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,160
your entire face.

455
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,200
Sometimes, we have to use two.

456
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,570
(Fascinated)

457
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,970
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

458
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,700
- Okay. I'll turn off the light.
- Bye.

459
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,740
- Bye.
- Goodnight.

460
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,080
(Pressing)

461
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,040
(He presses on his face
with the face mask on.)

462
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,480
(He frugally uses the serum
to hydrate his arms too.)

463
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,190
(This is how an actor of 14 years
takes care of his skin.)

464
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,590
Good job today.

465
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,020
- Good work.
- Good job.

466
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,590
It was fun.

467
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,460
- This is the entrance?
- Yes.

468
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,200
That's the entrance.
Where do you think it would be?

469
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,800
(Team Outdoors
gets ready to sleep too.)

470
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,240
Is it better
to go into the sleeping bag?

471
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,010
Here's the thing.
Personally, I open it up like this.

472
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,880
In winter, I usually go into it.

473
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,550
But now, it's uncomfortable.

474
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,550
(He shares a useful tip
with the newbie.)

475
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,580
So I just do this.

476
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,020
(Grunting)

477
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,220
- Will you give me your number?
- Yes.

478
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,220
(Hesitant)

479
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,760
- Is this our first time meeting?
- Yes, it is.

480
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,960
I'll do it.

481
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,390
Will you join us again if we ask?

482
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,930
I think it will be fun.

483
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,460
That's the thing.
Once some time passes by,

484
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,530
you think to yourself,
"That was pretty fun."

485
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,040
- What is this?
- What?

486
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,400
(The oldest member enters
the tent too.)

487
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,240
- Are you wearing a padded jacket?
- Yes.

488
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,110
- Why?
- In case it gets cold.

489
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,580
- If it's hot, I can take it off.
- Okay.

490
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,980
- But if it gets cold,
- My gosh.

491
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,050
- Really?
- I can't put on the jacket.

492
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,550
Gosh, today's tent is nice.

493
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,250
It's like having two bedrooms.

494
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,780
- This is nice. Why is it so nice?
- This is a nice tent.

495
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,880
(They are happy
to get a spacious tent.)

496
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,350
- Great job, everyone.
- Well done.

497
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,390
- Good work.
- Sleep tight.

498
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,520
Let's go to sleep.

499
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,220
We're all going to pass out.

500
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
(Perhaps, everyone
will go to sleep happily tonight.)

501
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,760
(Snoring)

502
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,630
(Se Yoon's snoring is
louder than usual.)

503
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,340
(Moving away)

504
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,640
(Luckily, Sae Ho and Bo Gum
are sleeping soundly.)

505
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,080
(Meanwhile, there's a man
snoring away in the tent too.)

506
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,180
(Sang Yi must've been very tired.)

507
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,460
(Distancing)

508
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,260
(The night deepens in the midst
of the snoring symphony.)

509
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,930
(The dawn has broken.)

510
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,370
(It's 5:32 a.m.)

511
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,370
(Startled)

512
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,910
(Cover Bo Gum with a blanket.)

513
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,680
Bo Gum, go under the blanket.

514
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,220
(Bo Gum, go under the blanket.)

515
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,990
(Let's sleep a little longer.)

516
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,560
(Meanwhile, Sang Yi wakes up alone
after a good night's sleep.)

517
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,270
(His rooster hairstyle exudes
a wild vibe this morning.)

518
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,870
(Bo Gum wakes up first
just like Sang Yi.)

519
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,270
(Could they be soulmates?)

520
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,380
(Raising his leg)

521
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,520
(Stiff Bo Gum)

522
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,020
(Spacing out)

523
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,990
(Speeding up the footage by 5 times)

524
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,160
(He must be awake now.
He's tidying up the bedding.)

525
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,000
(But he lies down again?)

526
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,270
(Flopping down)

527
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,340
(Just five more minutes.)

528
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:56,810
(Shortly after that, a song starts
playing at the base camp.)

529
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,320
(He gets ready
to go out right away.)

530
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,990
(Rushing)

531
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,060
(Faster than anyone else)

532
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,460
(More agile than anyone else)

533
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,200
Good boy

534
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,730
(I, who wakes up early,
am a good boy.)

535
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,840
Where should I go?

536
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,400
Which way should I go?

537
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,800
(He doesn't know the way,
but he doesn't stop walking.)

538
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,940
(The Sang Yi look-alike
comes out too.)

539
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,480
(Staggering)

540
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,010
(What?)

541
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,050
Good morning.

542
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,150
It was unexpectedly nice
to sleep outside.

543
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,190
Really?

544
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,590
Because it wasn't cold.

545
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,990
(Because it wasn't cold outside.)

546
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,960
I see that it's stopped raining.

547
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,930
- It's a relief, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

548
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,030
(He enjoys watching the scenery
for now.)

549
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,670
Good morning.

550
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,770
(Joon arrives.)

551
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,940
(Bowing)

552
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,140
- Joon, are you all right?
- Yes.

553
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,210
You're not okay?

554
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,710
Well, I'm fine, I guess.

555
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,710
(He doesn't look all right.)

556
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,450
- What are we going to eat?
- For breakfast?

557
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,720
- Let's wait until everyone's here.
- You'll tell us then.

558
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,520
(They're busy singing.)

559
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,420
(Where is Bo Gum?)

560
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,030
(Bo Gum has been getting ready
to go out for quite some time.)

561
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,740
(Dancing)

562
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,570
(Let's dance together.)

563
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:32,280
(The hip hop DJ brought a speaker
from somewhere.)

564
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,980
Hello.

565
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,520
(They're going to the place
for the morning mission 1 by 1.)

566
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,320
(These two are still engrossed
in dancing.)

567
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,190
Hey, wait.

568
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,390
We forgot Lymph Node.

569
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,690
(We should take Sae Ho, a patient,
with us.)

570
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,630
- Let's go find Lymph Node.
- "Lymph Node?"

571
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,000
- Hey, Lymph Node.
- Who's Lymph Node?

572
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,660
(Did you call me?)

573
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,130
Let's get going.

574
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,770
(He starts dancing automatically.)

575
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,610
(His upper body is immersed
in the music.)

576
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,780
- He seems fine. Let's just go.
- I'm here.

577
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,410
Let's go.

578
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,950
- You're here.
- You came in third.

579
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,410
Good morning, the third place.

580
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,850
- Good morning.
- Did you sleep well?

581
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,080
Good morning.

582
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,590
(They give each other
a morning hug.)

583
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,850
- Wasn't it cold outside?
- The order of arrival...

584
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,090
- doesn't matter, does it?
- No, it wasn't.

585
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,790
- Why?
- You seemed to be sleeping soundly.

586
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,260
- Me?
- Yes.
(Me?)

587
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,330
(Dumbfounded)

588
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,600
He must've been very tired.

589
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,260
Why? What happened?

590
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,170
Didn't you say you didn't snore?

591
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,200
Did I snore?

592
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
It seemed that
you didn't know much about yourself.

593
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,740
He must have been really tired.

594
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,010
- Tell me what's funny.
- Se Yoon, you're here.

595
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,110
- What's funny?
- I'm so embarrassed.

596
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,110
We were talking about
how he got knocked out.

597
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,710
- Did you sleep well, Bo Gum?
- Yes, I slept well.

598
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,180
- Wasn't Se Yoon too loud?
- No.

599
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,050
Was it tolerable?
I just gave you a sneak peek.

600
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,080
- How was it?
- It was okay.

601
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,150
- Oh, I see.
- Last night...

602
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,990
I mean, at dawn,
I woke up at 5:30 a.m. or 6 a.m.

603
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,090
Yes, he woke up
and went back to sleep.

604
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,490
- The sunlight was shining softly.
- Right.

605
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,060
Bo Gum was sleeping next to me.

606
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,460
- And he looked just so beautiful.
- Hey.

607
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,490
It was a beautiful sight.

608
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,790
- Come on. You're lying.
- While he was sleeping?

609
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,900
- Yes.
- He looked beautiful?

610
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,200
It was like a scene
from a bed commercial.

611
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,800
(His sleeping face like a fairy made
the floor blanket look like a bed.)

612
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,370
It was like a scene
from a bed commercial.

613
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
Look at the view behind you, guys.

614
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,670
That's beautiful.

615
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,310
The sea fog has moved away.

616
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,580
- That green thing is pretty too.
- It's green.

617
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,750
- What's that green thing?
- Exactly.

618
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,890
Did you see that? The color is...

619
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,250
It looks like scattered paint.

620
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,020
Oh, I know. The sun came up,
and it's shining the mountaintop.

621
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,260
I'm glad it's not raining now.

622
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,960
The air is clear and fresh.
It's nice.

623
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,190
It's refreshing.

624
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,060
You all seem to have slept well,

625
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,360
- so I'm relieved.
- Yes.

626
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,970
I'll tell you
about today's morning mission.

627
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,700
Breakfast is on the line.

628
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,670
- I want to eat breakfast.
- I'll be sure to eat.

629
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,570
- I want breakfast.
- You're hungry, aren't you?

630
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,110
We're having the Food Boy special.

631
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,470
- Yes.
- So for breakfast,

632
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,310
we prepared gukbap
from a famous gukbap place...

633
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,280
with 30 years of history
that represents Yeosu.

634
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,580
- Gukbap?
- Right.

635
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,880
I wonder what kind of gukbap it is.
Since it represents Yeosu...

636
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,150
Please bring it here.

637
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,520
Gosh. Look at that.

638
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,890
We'll play a random drink game
that Sang Yi wanted to play.

639
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,360
We thought...

640
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,890
(Surprised)

641
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,000
- A little bit of this too.
- Is that vinegar?

642
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,100
The game we often play
on 2 Days and 1 Night...

643
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,030
- It's salt water.
- Oh, salt water?

644
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,430
Since Sang Yi and Bo Gum would
join us,

645
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,970
we thought it'd be nice
to play our signature game.

646
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,910
- This will be hard.
- Salt water...

647
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,940
It's bad for blood pressure.

648
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,510
How many cups of those
have salt water?

649
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,040
Four of them have plain water...

650
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,350
while the other four have
a different kind of water.

651
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,310
While the other four have
a different kind of water.

652
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,150
(Bo Gum is looking
at the cups actively. "Let me see.")

653
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,150
It's hard to tell.

654
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,650
(Bo Gum is smiling happily?)

655
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,020
(Grinning)

656
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,190
(Did Bo Gum tell salt water
from plain water?)

657
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,130
And then we can give them some tips.

658
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
- I'll go with this one.
- Okay. Let's go.

659
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,570
- I think that's plain water.
- Cheers!

660
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
It must be salty. What?

661
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,240
(Gulping down)

662
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,640
It must be the same thing.

663
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,040
(Just as Bo Gum guessed,
DinDin picked plain water.)

664
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,210
Why did you throw it out?

665
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,910
(Timid)

666
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,910
What?

667
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,950
Because I wanted to.

668
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,420
But still...

669
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,320
Why do you care?
You'll leave after this anyway.

670
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,450
(DinDin the Kid acts tough
while avoiding eye contact.)

671
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,450
It must not be salt water.
I'm jealous.

672
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,590
Hey, what's that?
Have you made your choice?

673
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,490
Yes, he has.
Say "cheers" before you drink up.

674
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,560
I've been lucky my whole life.

675
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,090
- I'll drink it.
- Mr. Lucky Lee.

676
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,600
- It must be salty.
- Mr. Lucky Lee.

677
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,800
Can I go next?

678
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,130
- Now...
- Or will one of the guests go next?

679
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,100
- We have three cups of each left.
- Okay.

680
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,640
You can jump in whenever you want.

681
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,440
- You can just pick a cup.
- Right. There you go.

682
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,670
Okay? You can just pick a cup.

683
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
- Bye, Sae Ho.
- Oh, no. That must be salt water.

684
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,380
(Sae Ho boldly drinks it up.)

685
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,250
(What did Sae Ho choose?)

686
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,680
No, that must be salt water.

687
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,950
I'm 100 percent sure
that it's salt water.

688
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,380
(Sae Ho picked salt water.)

689
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,920
(He's surprised
at what salt water can do.)

690
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,090
- What is it?
- It's too salty.

691
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,590
(It's too salty.)

692
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,190
- Okay. Go ahead.
- You can just jump in.

693
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,260
This one is definitely salt water.

694
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,560
- He should take his medication.
- You think this one is salt water?

695
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,860
- Yes.
- Sae Ho should take his medication.

696
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,360
- He should take his medication.
- Drink it with your medication.

697
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,930
(Glancing)

698
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,260
- Bye.
- You have to pick... What?

699
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,000
(Bo Gum and Sang Yi made
their choices at the same time.)

700
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,600
- What's going on?
- We have two cups left.

701
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,670
I'll pick number four.

702
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,840
- Number 4? I'll go with number 8.
- I have no idea.

703
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,570
Let's start with those who made
their choices first.

704
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,870
- Please step forward to the stage.
- Should I step forward?

705
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,210
- It'll be quite a performance.
- It's because...

706
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,980
You'll need some space
so that you can spit it out.

707
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,910
Thank you all for your hard work
since yesterday.

708
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,980
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

709
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,550
(What could be Sang Yi's fate?)

710
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,450
(Is it plain water?)

711
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,890
(Gulping down)

712
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,660
Can you save some for me?
The salty taste is unbearable.

713
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,130
Thank you.

714
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,460
(Sang Yi picked plain water.)

715
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,560
- Was it plain water?
- Yes.

716
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,400
(That's amazing.)

717
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,900
- Hey, I...
- I was eyeing that one too. Gosh.

718
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,300
How many cups do we have left?
Two cups?

719
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,200
- It's still too salty. Goodness.
- Did he pick plain water?

720
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,840
(I'm nervous.)

721
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,940
All right. Okay.
Let's drink at the same time.

722
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,440
- Cheers.
- That's definitely salt water.

723
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,640
- It's definitely salt water.
- It must be salt water.

724
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,810
- Cheers. This is number 8.
- Number 8 must be salty.

725
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,420
It must be salty.
I bet it's very salty.

726
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,420
- It must be salty.
- It must be plain water.

727
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,720
- Is it plain water?
- Oh, gosh.

728
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,790
It must be really salty.

729
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,420
I bet it's salty.

730
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,690
(Se Yoon picked plain water.)

731
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,460
- There's only 1 cup left.
- We have 1 cup left, right?

732
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,730
- Do we have 1 cup of plain water?
- There's 1 cup of plain water left.

733
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,960
- How about we all drink together?
- Okay.

734
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,200
- They'll drink at the same time.
- All right.

735
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,330
(Seon Ho, Jong Min, and Bo Gum
will drink at the same time.)

736
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,630
Bo Gum,
do you think yours is salt water?

737
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,940
(Looking carefully)

738
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,310
- Oh, what?
- What?

739
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,440
Will you drink it right away?
You won't change it?

740
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,840
- No, I won't change it.
- Do you want mine instead?

741
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,910
No, I don't.

742
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,640
- How about mine?
- I'm good.

743
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,580
- I want yours suddenly.
- No, I refuse to switch cups.

744
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,580
I guess confidence plays a big part.

745
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,650
- Good job, you two.
- I suddenly want to switch cups.

746
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,150
- Okay.
- What's going on?

747
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,290
Ready. One, two, three.

748
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,720
- Drink up.
- Good luck.

749
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,120
(There's only one cup
of plain water left.)

750
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,830
(Could he maintain his honor
as the master of a random drink game?)

751
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,460
(It's Bo Gum's first time playing
this game. Could he be good at it?)

752
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,860
(Seon Ho got the last cup left.
Could he be lucky?)

753
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,270
(How will the fate of these three
turn out?)

754
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,170
(Seon Ho picked salt water.)

755
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,500
Bo Gum is incredible.

756
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,210
- What?
- No way.

757
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,540
(There were 2 cups of salt water,
but only 1 of them spit out?)

758
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,540
(Which one of them
drank salt water?)

759
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,110
(Swallowing)

760
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,810
- What?
- No way.

761
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,280
(Is it Bo Gum
who gulps down the water?)

762
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,550
What is...

763
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,950
- Jong Min, is that salt water?
- No.

764
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,220
- Are you faking it?
- No.

765
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
(It's not salt water?)

766
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,130
- Bo Gum, is that...
- It's salt water.

767
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,990
- How did you drink that?
- How did you drink the salt water?

768
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,160
(Cheerful)

769
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,730
- Hey.
- Unbelievable.

770
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,730
- Are you serious?
- My gosh.

771
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,100
- How did he drink it?
- It's no joke.

772
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,100
- Try a sip, Sang Yi.
- You can't drink it.

773
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,900
You can't drink it.

774
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,270
(This is the normal reaction.)

775
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,510
- I told you, you can't drink it.
- Why did you drink it?

776
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,710
- There's no way. How could he...
- My gosh.

777
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,840
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

778
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,180
(I'm fine.)

779
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,380
Impressive.

780
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,110
Jong Min, DinDin, Sang Yi,
and Se Yoon.

781
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,150
We'll give the four of you
breakfast.

782
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,280
My gosh. That was unbelievable.

783
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,950
Please heat it up
until it's boiling hot.

784
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,920
What kind of gukbap is it?

785
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,790
You'll be surprised when you see it.
I'll explain after that.

786
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,360
- Okay.
- Will it surprise us?

787
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,530
- Is it that impressive?
- I wonder what it is.

788
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,190
Hello.

789
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,700
(They're very surprised.)

790
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,130
(Startled)

791
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,970
- Hello. Here's your food.
- The owner of the restaurant...

792
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

793
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,670
- You brought the food by yourself?
- Oh, my.

794
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,700
- You came here by yourself?
- Thank you.

795
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,900
(The restaurant owner came
by himself during the morning rush.)

796
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,370
So early in the morning...
Oh, my. What's this?

797
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,940
(Amazed)

798
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,040
- What is this?
- I'll put this here.

799
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,510
- Please put it here.
- Here?

800
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,380
- No, sir.
- Here?

801
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,580
- Sir, please put it here.
- No.

802
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,210
- No, sir. It's for us.
- Here.

803
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,280
- Here?
- We're all here.

804
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,350
He seems
to want to give it to Bo Gum.

805
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,420
- I'll put this here.
- No, that's for us.

806
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,520
- He must want to give it to him.
- I'm sorry.

807
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
We won the game.

808
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,090
- I almost got fooled.
- Bo Gum pulled a prank.

809
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,660
It's been a long time.

810
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,330
It's been 12 years
since the last time I saw you.

811
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,630
- Right?
- Yes.

812
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,600
(Jong Min has visited
the restaurant before.)

813
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,000
(The famous local restaurant
with 30 years of history in Yeosu)

814
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,400
I see perilla seeds on top.

815
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,170
It has a lot of whole perilla seeds,
which gives the dish a nutty taste.

816
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,940
Oh, my. What's this?
We got suyuk too.

817
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,250
Suyuk with Yeosu's specialty
Dolsan mustard greens kimchi...

818
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,280
is the best dish of this restaurant.

819
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,720
- Please try the food now.
- This one?

820
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,820
- Everything looks so tasty.
- Thank you.

821
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,150
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

822
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,320
(Se Yoon tastes the broth first.)

823
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,530
(Jong Min tastes the vegetables
in the soup first.)

824
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,790
It tastes the same as before, right?

825
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,800
(Amazed)

826
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,200
The taste hasn't changed at all.

827
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,530
It's good.

828
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,100
The meat is so tender.

829
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,570
(DinDin has a big spoonful of rice
with the broth.)

830
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,140
- Ox head meat? Can I add this too?
- You can put them all in.

831
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,110
- Yes. Okay.
- Like this? Oh, I see. Okay.

832
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,210
- I'll enjoy the food.
- Please enjoy.

833
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,510
- It looks so delicious.
- It's delicious.

834
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
- It's really good.
- I'll try the meat.

835
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,980
(Swallowing saliva)

836
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,320
Did you prepare all this food
for us?

837
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,220
Thank you so much for the food.
We'll enjoy it.

838
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,450
- Go ahead and eat it.
- I'm okay.

839
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,550
- Come on.
- I'm good.

840
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,820
- Go ahead.
- Oh, my. Look at Bo Gum.

841
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,690
(I was just messing with you.)

842
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,990
Did he offer the food
and then take it away?

843
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,760
(DinDin the Brat pranks
the younger one with food.)

844
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,100
- Oh, my. It's so good.
- Ten years ago, I...

845
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,130
This suyuk is so tender.

846
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,630
And the meat is sliced thickly.

847
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,240
Right. The suyuk is amazing, indeed.

848
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,000
- I mean... It's so good.
- It's good.

849
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,070
- It's good.
- Indeed. The meat is so tasty.

850
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,870
Can I make a vegetable wrap
for Bo Gum?

851
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,380
- Exactly. Can he have one?
- Can I give him a wrap?

852
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,510
I'm good.

853
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,150
- It's okay. I'll give it to you.
- Jong Min, you should...

854
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,780
- It's because I feel bad.
- Sure. You can give him that.

855
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,320
I made this for you, Bo Gum.

856
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,320
Here you go. It's really tasty.

857
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,690
- No, it's okay.
- He's not joking around.

858
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,020
- Are you serious, Jong Min?
- Yes. I'm giving it to you.

859
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,090
- Can I eat it, really?
- Bo Gum is hesitating...

860
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,590
Of course, you can eat it.
It's okay.

861
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,590
- Jong Min is giving it to you.
- Try it and tell us how it tastes.

862
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,090
Thank you.

863
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,700
I'm sure
Sang Yi will do the same thing.

864
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,800
I want to give this to Joon
who slept outside with me.

865
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
(Sang Yi picked Joon.)

866
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,070
This is not what I expected.

867
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,640
(Sae Ho feels bitter.)

868
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,610
- Are you happy? Is it tasty?
- Yes. It's good.

869
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,740
Sang Yi is making
another vegetable wrap.

870
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,210
(Hopeful)

871
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,050
(Sang Yi walks up to them again
with a vegetable wrap.)

872
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,080
Sang Yi is coming back. He's coming.

873
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,320
He's going back there.

874
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,650
(Who will Sang Yi choose?)

875
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,690
The youngest one first.

876
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:12,960
Really?

877
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,620
(Sad, happy)

878
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,830
- Poor Sae Ho.
- Exactly.

879
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,990
- This is fun.
- He's such a warm-hearted person.

880
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,000
- He gave it to the youngest one.
- That's it.

881
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,130
What do you mean by that?

882
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,070
Why would you say that?

883
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,270
(Sae Ho gets upset.)

884
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,100
The other four of you
should eat too.

885
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,240
That sounds nice.

886
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,070
It's nurungji. It's great.

887
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,880
- It's perfect for my condition.
- It looks good.

888
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,110
This is so great.

889
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,310
- Thank you.
- I often eat this for breakfast.

890
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,950
(Blowing)

891
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,020
- Thank you for this.
- I'll enjoy this.

892
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,420
Nurungji is good for health.

893
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,020
It's one of the most common dishes
in Korea.

894
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,020
(Glancing)

895
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,120
My, it's good.

896
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,060
It tastes how nurungji should taste.

897
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,060
- Nurungji is good for breakfast.
- It's good for breakfast.

898
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,730
(They put food in their mouths
at the same time.)

899
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,760
(Glancing)

900
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,870
My, it's good.

901
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,870
(His eyes are fixed on the gukbap.)

902
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,230
What would you say...

903
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,540
- if we give one of you gukbap?
- Sounds good.

904
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,210
- We'd be happy.
- Of course, it sounds good.

905
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,240
When you were having dinner
yesterday,

906
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,040
Sang Yi suggested this idea.

907
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,980
- You'll play Lee Sang Yi Game.
- What's that?

908
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,680
Lee Sang Yi, seagull...

909
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,910
Tomato and Yeoksam Station.

910
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,480
You have to say words with the first
and the last syllables...

911
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,680
that are pronounced the same...

912
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,590
- in relays, starting with Bo Gum.
- I see.

913
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,450
From Bo Gum to Seon Ho,
and then back to Bo Gum.

914
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,860
- We can't repeat the same word?
- That's right.

915
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,060
- Do you understand the rules?
- Yes.

916
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,390
- Shall we start with Bo Gum?
- Sounds good. Okay.

917
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,600
Ready. Set. Go.

918
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,730
Lee Sang Yi.

919
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,100
Tomato.

920
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,530
Lee Hyo Ri.

921
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,700
Yeoksam Station.

922
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,800
Switzerland.

923
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,970
- Three.
- Jean Valjean.

924
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,680
Seagull.

925
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,080
Sunday.

926
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,450
Three.

927
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,020
- Two...
- Woo Young Woo.

928
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,450
(Bo Gum is good at this game.)

929
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,150
- Has anyone said "audio?"
- No, but I'm going to.

930
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,520
Oh, I see.

931
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,160
- Audio.
- Nice.

932
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
(Sae Ho snatched the answer.)

933
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,560
Laboratory.

934
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,600
- They're good at this game.
- Three, two, one.

935
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,770
I am me.

936
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,070
You failed.

937
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,000
You failed.

938
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,170
That was cute.

939
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,670
It doesn't count?

940
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,940
- I saved it for later.
- "I am me."

941
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,480
(He failed because it wasn't a noun
or a proper noun.)

942
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,450
You'll be eliminated if you say
any words that were mentioned.

943
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,310
- Okay.
- Ready, go.

944
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,580
Are there any other words like them?

945
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,550
I failed.

946
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,790
There are no more words like them.

947
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,490
Aria.

948
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,930
- As in "celestial aria."
- Aria.

949
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,930
- Joon.
- He came up with another word.

950
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,600
Written oath.

951
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,060
(What has gotten into Joon?)

952
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,470
(Scraping the bowl)

953
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,240
- Three, two...
- Bo Gum is scraping his bowl.

954
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,670
- Do you want gukbap that much?
- One.

955
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,710
(No, I don't.)

956
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,680
You failed.
Joon will get to eat gukbap.

957
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,080
(Joon gained gukbap.)

958
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,340
- Joon is...
- Joon won.

959
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,650
I am becoming the ace of the team.

960
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,480
I am the ace!

961
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,520
(Joon enjoyed gukbap.)

962
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,050
- Did you enjoy your meal?
- Yes.

963
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,990
We'll go to the beach nearby...

964
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,830
and do the last shoot
to wrap up the trip.

965
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,260
- Got it.
- Won't we dive into the water?

966
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,860
- Sorry?
- Stop making unnecessary comments.

967
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,270
Since we're near the beach,
if I were the director...

968
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,430
Start your own YouTube channel
and do that.

969
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,570
Why would you make
such a useless remark?

970
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,540
- Then let's get going now.
- Okay.

971
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,210
- I enjoyed the food.
- Thank you for the food.

972
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,910
What's this smell?

973
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,710
- The scent of phytoncides.
- The scent of the forest.

974
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,980
(The trail to the beach is filled
with phytoncides.)

975
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,310
We can enjoy this scent
whenever we shoot this show.

976
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,950
- The scent of the forest!
- Yes, we enjoy this kind of scent.

977
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,990
(They walk along
the refreshing forest trail.)

978
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,920
(And this is the place
where we'll end our trip.)

979
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,060
Don't you have a bad feeling
about this?

980
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,390
- Right?
- Yes.

981
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,060
- I have a hunch.
- Exactly.

982
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,060
(Only the experienced entertainers
know this feeling.)

983
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,170
I have a feeling that one of us will
have to dive into the water.

984
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,770
Who will that be?

985
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,600
- Joon.
- Why?

986
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,010
- I think he'll go into the water.
- Why me?

987
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,770
Water activities suit Joon
for some reason.

988
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,240
I agree.

989
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,110
Do we have to swim
to that thing on the water?

990
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,720
(Me?)

991
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,250
(Making a V sign)

992
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,520
Oh, my. It's so nice.

993
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,960
(What will be our last activity?)

994
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,590
- You're here.
- Yes?

995
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,260
Joon should be the one
to dive into the water.

996
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,130
- I mean, he...
- He shouldn't have said that.

997
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,060
They were setting up a game
in the assembly hall,

998
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,730
but they suddenly changed the plan
and brought us here.

999
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,000
(DinDin is sure that one of them
will dive into the water.)

1000
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,070
(I'm sorry.)

1001
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,270
The floating object over there is
Ae Sun.

1002
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,140
Swim to Ae Sun.

1003
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,680
(Se Yoon thinks they have to swim
to the floating object?)

1004
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,240
"When Life Soaks You in Water."

1005
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,950
(2 Days and 1 Night Series,
"When Life Soaks You in Water")

1006
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,380
"When Life Makes You
Dive into Water."

1007
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,810
Their original plan was
to make us go into the water...

1008
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,820
- last night.
- By the way...

1009
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,350
There he comes.

1010
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,250
- Mr. Cho Sae Ho is coming.
- Right.

1011
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,520
Mr. Cho Sae Ho...

1012
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,660
(The staff drove Sae Ho here
considering his condition.)

1013
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,890
(Welcome)

1014
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,030
(Laughing)

1015
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,900
Mr. Cho Sae Ho who will
dive into the water today...

1016
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,230
has been standing out in his field
as Lymph Node.

1017
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,140
Let's meet Mr. Cho Sae Ho,
Korea's best entertainer.

1018
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,010
The master
of silly but funny comments.

1019
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,640
Thank you.

1020
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,040
(He appears, wearing his signature hat,
a baby bottle hat.)

1021
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,380
- The staff were considerate of me.
- Yes.

1022
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,410
Thanks to you,

1023
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,120
I feel much better
than I did at 8 a.m., an hour ago.

1024
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,790
- Really? I'm glad to hear that.
- Yes.

1025
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,820
(I'm infinitely grateful.)

1026
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,820
Are you wearing
a green tea flavored baby bottle?

1027
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,930
- It's a matcha flavored one.
- Oh, I see.

1028
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,260
That's right.

1029
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,600
- We only have one last activity.
- Yes.

1030
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,440
During the last shoot,
we made a promise.

1031
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,740
The two guests...

1032
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,800
- must not know about it, obviously.
- Right.

1033
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,810
(Sang Yi and Bo Gum didn't know.)

1034
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,040
(Sae Ho was chosen to be the one
to dive into water at the opening.)

1035
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,450
- Is it okay to tell the guests?
- About what?

1036
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,550
Can we tell them that we decided to
make guests dive into water?

1037
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,280
That's mean.

1038
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,190
(Be quiet.)

1039
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,290
Bo Gum,
I guess we've become quite close.

1040
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,190
You brat.

1041
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,060
He hit me.

1042
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,190
(Feeling good)

1043
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,060
- We are family, right?
- Who are family?

1044
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
- Who?
- You see...

1045
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,070
Sae Ho, who's our family member,

1046
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,700
had surgery recently.

1047
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,000
So we'll select one member
to substitute for Sae Ho...

1048
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,940
and dive into the water.

1049
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,180
- It'll take us about 18 hours.
- This is...

1050
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,440
- To substitute for Sae Ho...
- I think this is...

1051
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,150
By any chance,
are these two in our family too?

1052
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,580
- Of course, they are.
- Are they our family too?

1053
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,350
- I'm just an acquaintance of yours.
- Are they our family too?

1054
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,020
- Oh, an acquaintance?
- They're our family now.

1055
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,350
- You're our acquaintance?
- He said it so seriously.

1056
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,060
- Just an acquaintance?
- Lee Sang Yi will sing...

1057
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,120
"I'm Just an Acquaintance of Yours."

1058
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,460
(Sae Ho is
just an acquaintance of mine)

1059
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,630
But don't you like new experiences?

1060
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,170
Well, I don't feel like
experiencing a new thing today.

1061
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,400
(He doesn't feel like
experiencing a new thing today.)

1062
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,500
But...

1063
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,470
(Yesterday, you said
you were willing to go into water.)

1064
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,940
Anyway, how will we decide?

1065
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,210
All right. Please bring it here.

1066
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,250
- What's going on? What's that?
- You should've told us before.

1067
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,180
(He's curious what it is.)

1068
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,950
- Will we play a game?
- Oh, we'll spin a roulette.

1069
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,720
- Oh, gosh.
- Okay.

1070
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,420
I'm sure I won't be chosen.

1071
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,920
(Here comes the roulette.)

1072
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,990
Can I divide the roulette wheel
into slots?

1073
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,490
- Then let's...
- How about this?

1074
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,600
Each of our names is written
in three slots...

1075
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,000
while your names are written
in just one slot. What do you say?

1076
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,770
- Just one slot.
- There's no way you'll be chosen.

1077
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,570
- There's no way.
- Bo Gum, you won't be chosen.

1078
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,870
(I would do it if there's one slot
with my name on it.)

1079
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,410
- Okay.
- Okay.

1080
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,510
(Deal!)

1081
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,780
- That one slot will create a twist.
- Should we go into the water?

1082
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,780
(Who will go into the cold sea water
in May?)

1083
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,690
Those people are going
into the water willingly.

1084
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,990
- Going into where?
- Look over there.

1085
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
(Some people want
to go into the sea.)

1086
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,890
They're walking with their feet
in the water, indeed.

1087
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,730
You hired them, didn't you?

1088
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,330
I'm 100 percent sure of it.

1089
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,700
- Don't be ridiculous.
- They must be our staff members.

1090
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,970
It's ridiculous.
They're wearing black.

1091
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,230
I'm sure
they've been hired to do that.

1092
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,540
(It's true that we often wear
black clothes, but...)

1093
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,540
(Anyway, they're not from our team.)

1094
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,080
(Meanwhile, the roulette wheel is
divided into slots.)

1095
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,580
- There are 20 slots, right?
- Yes.

1096
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,840
If one of us is chosen...

1097
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,010
There's no way you'll be chosen.

1098
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,120
But I'm always so unlucky.

1099
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,880
(They're anxious even though
each of them has only one slot.)

1100
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,390
- Gosh, I'm nervous.
- I won't be chosen.

1101
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,450
(Please let it be someone else but me.)

1102
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,090
- This is driving me nuts.
- It'll be either me or Joon.

1103
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,790
- It's done.
- We're ready.

1104
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,160
I'm so nervous.

1105
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
(Everyone's name has been written.)

1106
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,230
(Bo Gum, Sang Yi)

1107
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,340
- Who will spin it?
- It should be Sae Ho.

1108
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,040
- Shall I?
- Sae Ho should spin it.

1109
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,810
Sae Ho, you divided it,
so you should spin it too.

1110
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,710
With my heart full of gratitude,
I will spin this.

1111
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,350
- Wait.
- One.

1112
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,680
- Two.
- Please.

1113
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,580
(The nerve-racking moment)

1114
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,580
- Three.
- Please!

1115
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,890
(The roulette wheel was spun.)

1116
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,090
- Please.
- It's colder to go in alone.

1117
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,760
- You'll feel so lonely too.
- Please.

1118
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,590
(Please....)

1119
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,090
(skip my name.)

1120
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,800
If it's either Sang Yi or Bo Gum...

1121
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,000
That can't be helped.

1122
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,200
It's three seconds
after it stops spinning.

1123
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,900
- We have to consider the wind.
- Please.

1124
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,740
(3 seconds later the wheel stops,
the chosen one goes in the water.)

1125
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,700
- I feel so nervous.
- No, keep spinning.

1126
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,440
That can't be. Where is it?

1127
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,570
- Oh, no.
- It's spinning fast.

1128
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,640
- No.
- Okay.

1129
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,610
- No.
- Oh, no!

1130
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,080
It's dangerous.

1131
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,380
(Seon Ho, DinDin, Bo Gum)

1132
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,650
- Oh, no.
- Goodness.

1133
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,720
(Go away!)

1134
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,790
(Bo Gum)

1135
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,560
(Thankfully, it passes
Bo Gum's name.)

1136
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,130
(DinDin is chosen.)

1137
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,260
It's me.

1138
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,660
(No!)

1139
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,660
One.

1140
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,130
(DinDin)

1141
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,070
- One, two.
- Two.

1142
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,800
(The wheel spins
because of the wind.)

1143
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,210
- My goodness.
- Who will it be?

1144
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,440
(It passes Bo Gum.)

1145
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,380
- Who is it?
- No.

1146
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,410
Seon Ho.

1147
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:34,220
It's Seon Ho. One, two, three.

1148
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,920
It's Yoo Seon Ho.

1149
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,190
- It's Yoo Seon Ho.
- It's Yoo Seon Ho.

1150
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,290
(Yoo Seon Ho will go in the water.)

1151
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,490
(An explosion of dopamine)

1152
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,160
(To be honest, I'm thrilled.)

1153
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,200
Oh, no.

1154
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,670
That was incredible.
How did that happen?

1155
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,830
(Luckily, DinDin narrowly escaped.)

1156
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,500
You're saved.

1157
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,970
- Unbelievable.
- It was like shooting a movie.

1158
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,170
(Thrilled)

1159
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,080
- The wind made it interesting.
- That was fun.

1160
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,140
It's very windy today.

1161
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,510
It's so much fun. That's why...

1162
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,680
- we can't quit diving in the water.
- Let's go.

1163
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,180
It was very nerve-racking.

1164
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,220
When it was pointing at your name.

1165
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,820
(He was almost chosen
to go in the water.)

1166
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,190
Continue your conversation.
I'm going to get warmed up.

1167
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,290
You should go for a jog.

1168
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,790
I didn't expect to play
so many games.

1169
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,360
I didn't expect to get
so little food.

1170
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,960
(Munching)

1171
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,570
I didn't think I'd pass out in bed.
To be honest,

1172
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,040
I thought I'd sleep comfortably.

1173
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,600
You slept more than a newborn
last night.

1174
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
(You slept like a newborn.)

1175
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,010
I'm leaving with
such wonderful memories.

1176
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,040
Thank you.

1177
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,210
With DinDin...

1178
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,210
- They've become friends.
- You became friends with him.

1179
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,410
We exchanged our numbers.

1180
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,010
(Two friends of the same age
with fantastic chemistry)

1181
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,180
- See you.
- Bye.

1182
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,020
(Their friendship forever)

1183
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,260
During the last two days,

1184
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,020
with my beloved Sang Yi...

1185
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,490
and other members on the show,

1186
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:56,370
I ate well. I had a good rest,
and I had a good time.

1187
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,640
Thank you for such great memories.

1188
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,370
- That's well said.
- On our way down here,

1189
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,170
this is what I asked him.

1190
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,710
"Is it possible for you to stay
one more night..."

1191
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,180
"right at this moment?"

1192
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,180
He said, "If there's no problem,
it'd be possible for me."

1193
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,680
- Seriously.
- Was he that positive?

1194
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,520
I hope that he'll come back
next time.

1195
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,050
(We hope that you'll visit
2 Days and 1 Night again.)

1196
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,790
- Do a high five before you start.
- A high five?

1197
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,690
- Good luck.
- There he goes.

1198
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,630
- Say something before you go in.
- All right.

1199
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,130
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1200
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,900
- Let's go.
- Let's go, Seon Ho.

1201
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,270
Oh, no.

1202
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,370
(Going straight into the sea
without hesitation)

1203
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,380
(The youngest goes in more easily
than we thought.)

1204
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,610
- What?
- He's going in easily.

1205
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,210
- He's going in easily.
- I can do it.

1206
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,380
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

1207
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,650
- Go in.
- It's going to make me cry.

1208
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,820
(Splash)

1209
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,420
- Seon Ho, fall on your back.
- Come out.

1210
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,220
Seon Ho, fall on your back.

1211
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,220
(DinDin who raises him tough,
Bo Gum who is worried)

1212
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,060
- On your back.
- Who are we?

1213
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,960
- We are 2 Days and 1 Night.
- 2 Days and 1 Night!

1214
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,930
Well done.

1215
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,700
(From head to toe, he goes
into the water successfully.)

1216
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,400
- Aren't you cold?
- Is the water warm?

1217
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,410
Can you check?

1218
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,810
- Is it cold?
- Is the water cold?

1219
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,310
Goodness.

1220
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,780
Oh, no.

1221
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,510
- Cover yourself.
- The water looks warm.

1222
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,710
- He looks relaxed.
- It's because he looks relaxed.

1223
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,750
It didn't look hard.

1224
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,980
It was cold but amazing.

1225
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,720
- Thank you, everyone.
- Well done.

1226
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,920
(Everyone, well done until the end.)

1227
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,560
What is he doing?

1228
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
(Exploding with charms
with one look on his face)

1229
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,630
(Lying down...)

1230
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,500
(and bouncing around)

1231
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:39,500
(For the last 2 days,
they gave it their all.)

1232
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,470
(Charming Good Boy, Lee Sang Yi)

1233
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,010
(He can play the piano well.)

1234
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,210
It looks like a commercial.

1235
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,580
(He also eats well.)

1236
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,420
(He's good at clearing
the missions.)

1237
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,650
You're my friend.

1238
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:02,360
(For the last 2 days,
his good looks also worked hard.)

1239
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,030
(Good Boy by existence, Park Bo Gum)

1240
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,030
(Memories of 2 Days and 1 Night
in photos)

1241
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,940
(We were happy to spend time
with two Good Boys.)

1242
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,470
- Who are we?
- We're 2 Days...

1243
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,980
- And 1 Night.
- And 1 Night.

1244
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,780
- This is how we do it.
- When we say, "Who are we?"

1245
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,180
we say it with this tone.

1246
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,580
- Who are we?
- Who are we?

1247
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,380
Who are we?

1248
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,450
A trip in Yeosu with Food Boys.

1249
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,120
Don't turn away and leave
if you think it'll be delicious.

1250
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,620
Run to Yeosu right now.

1251
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,730
Please show your love for "Good Boy,"
starring me and Bo Gum.

1252
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,500
The best in Korea.

1253
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,730
A real wild road variety show.

1254
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:45,270
- Who are we?
- We're 2 Days...

1255
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,670
- 1 Night.
- 1 Night.

1256
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,940
That was great.

1257
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,140
Good job.

1258
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,810
- Who are we?
- Who are we?

1259
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,850
(2 Days and 1 Night)

1260
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,980
(One refreshing day in May)

1261
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,450
(We're starting at a different spot,
not the usual main building.)

1262
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,660
- Hello.
- Hello.

1263
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,560
Hello.

1264
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,790
(The members gather with
a lot of luggage in both hands.)

1265
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,930
Hello.

1266
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,390
- Hello.
- Goodness.

1267
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,760
- Hello.
- It's good to see you.

1268
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,760
It's good to see you too.

1269
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,170
We got to meet somewhere close.

1270
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,200
Joon, you look much better.
What happened?

1271
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,340
Tell us about it.

1272
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,640
- I lost some weight.
- My gosh.

1273
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,440
- Didn't you lose muscle?
- I lost some muscle too.

1274
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,080
I heard that he's preparing himself
for a musical.

1275
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,210
When he tried on the school uniform,
he looked like a thug.

1276
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,980
- His deltoids...
- Because of his muscles?

1277
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,480
burst through the school uniform.

1278
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,990
- He didn't think it could work.
- When I put on the school uniform,

1279
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,920
I looked too much like a thug.

1280
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,860
The sleeves were about to burst.

1281
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,630
On top of that,
I play someone very innocent.

1282
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,430
A high school student doesn't have
huge arms.

1283
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,560
- I looked like this.
- As a high school student?

1284
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,600
I had to say, "You don't like me?"

1285
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,130
- I couldn't see anyone liking me.
- With huge arms.

1286
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,400
- Did you look threatening?
- That's exactly right.

1287
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,440
In order to look innocent,

1288
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,270
I'm holding myself from working out.

1289
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,540
My social media algorithms are based
on our members.

1290
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,310
Recently, Seon Ho's video came up
on my account.

1291
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,310
I saw a video of him
playing baseball.

1292
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,950
- He pitches well.
- His velocity is 117km per hour?

1293
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,180
It's 117km per hour.

1294
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:14,760
(Recently, Seon Ho threw
the first ball for Kiwoom Heroes.)

1295
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,430
(His steady posture from being part
of the Little League)

1296
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,800
(His fast velocity of 117km per hour
became the talk of the town.)

1297
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,100
- For an ordinary person,
- About 80km per hour.

1298
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,100
pitching faster than 100km...

1299
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,230
- per hour isn't easy.
- Definitely not.

1300
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,300
I bet you and I pitch
at 70km per hour.

1301
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,140
- Between 60km and 70km.
- You think so?

1302
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,910
- Of course.
- Don't you weigh 130kg?

1303
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,840
- I weigh about 123kg now.
- About 123kg.

1304
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,110
- That's how much I weigh.
- Really?

1305
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,510
You planned it nicely.

1306
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,310
Are you feeling well today?

1307
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,880
Me? Thanks to your love
and consideration,

1308
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,120
I'm much better.

1309
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,880
- Are you okay?
- I can even do this.

1310
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,020
(Bouncing up and down)

1311
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,120
- You recover so quickly.
- Yes.

1312
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,960
Up until now since then,

1313
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,820
- I abstained from drinking.
- Really?

1314
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,690
- I took medicine and slept well.
- You look much better.

1315
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:53,030
This is what made me realize
that Sae Ho is doing well.

1316
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,300
Sae Ho did a photoshoot.

1317
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,800
- This is really...
- He uploaded it.

1318
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,870
I thought I should point it out.

1319
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,170
I wanted to write a comment,
but I didn't.

1320
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,270
- Let me show you.
- Is that it?

1321
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,310
Is it a pharmaceutical commercial?

1322
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:05,810
- Is that Sae Ho?
- It's nothing big.

1323
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:06,810
- He looks amazing.
- Is it really Sae Ho?

1324
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,340
This is ChoNam Zone.

1325
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,510
(Dressed up in a photoshoot
for ChoNam Zone)

1326
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,080
- It's a little...
- He looks 180cm tall.

1327
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,890
The photographer was just amazing.

1328
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,620
- Her name is Young Ju.
- You mean the photographer?

1329
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,030
His body is 6.5 heads tall.

1330
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,030
He's not the Yangbaechu
from the past.

1331
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,600
I look much better than before.

1332
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,130
- Sae Ho, you look...
- How can he look so different?

1333
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,170
- so different from the photo.
- I look exactly the same.

1334
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,300
- You look completely different.
- I look the same.

1335
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,500
Look at that.

1336
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,500
(How Cho Sae Ho changed in 3 stages)

1337
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,440
- But this is...
- The difference is too drastic.

1338
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,410
Aren't people like Jung Woo Sung
in photos like this?

1339
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,580
Look at this.

1340
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,280
- You can't trust any photos now.
- Why not?

1341
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,980
It's way too photoshopped.

1342
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:48,080
In the photo, someone is standing
next to him, right?

1343
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,020
- Right.
- Sae Ho is standing here.

1344
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,760
- This is the photo.
- Here's what's shocking.

1345
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,660
I worked very hard for the shoot.
You even bought the magazine.

1346
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,390
- Of course.
- Do you want my autograph on it?

1347
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,500
Sure.

1348
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,730
- Only if you want.
- Yes.

1349
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,930
- What's your name?
- It's Joo Jong Hyun.

1350
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:06,370
- Mr. Joo Jong Hyun?
- Yes.

1351
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,470
He's a man who appears in magazines.

1352
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,540
Thank you.

1353
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,910
On my way home after the shoot,
Bo Gum sent me a text.

1354
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:14,640
- Didn't everyone get one?
- At first,

1355
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,750
- I thought that it was spam.
- Really?

1356
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,920
He sounded so honest in his message.

1357
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,380
I also called Sang Yi...

1358
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,780
- after the shoot.
- Really?

1359
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,220
Didn't he get scared?

1360
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,550
- What?
- Didn't he get a little scared?

1361
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,590
- Who?
- Sang Yi.

1362
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:27,720
(The relationship
between Sang Yi and Cheol)

1363
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:32,130
(Both born in 1991,
Cheol and Sang Yi are the same age.)

1364
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:34,700
(Strangely, Cheol always felt small
in front of Sang Yi.)

1365
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,900
(Cheol)

1366
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,270
(Just hearing him call his name
made Cheol nervous.)

1367
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,100
(He looks scared.)

1368
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,800
(Lee Sang Yi, DinDin's natural enemy
who appeared after a long time)

1369
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,910
- Who? Lee Sang Yi?
- Yes.

1370
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,070
Call him over.

1371
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,080
(Bluffing)

1372
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,210
He's easy to deal with.

1373
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,350
It was my first time seeing
DinDin look so innocent.

1374
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:52,880
He was like a frightened Chihuahua.

1375
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,420
Once we meet each other three times,
he'll be inferior to me.

1376
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,150
(Acting pretentious
now that Sang Yi is gone)

1377
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,950
You know what surprised me that day?

1378
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,290
Bo Gum was wearing a facial mask.

1379
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:03,630
- Really?
- He takes care of his skin.

1380
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,590
After seeing Bo Gum use
facial masks,

1381
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,160
I started using them too.

1382
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,730
- That's why you look better.
- Really?

1383
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,830
- Do I look okay?
- You're ugly with nice skin.

1384
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,370
(You're ugly,
but you have nice skin.)

1385
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,440
What?

1386
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,310
I mean...

1387
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:19,540
- Still...
- The last part...

1388
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,080
- of his comment is positive.
- At least you have nice skin.

1389
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,110
It's the most insulting comment
I've ever heard.

1390
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,650
- He's the worst.
- Only his skin is nice.

1391
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,650
- What are we doing today?
- Where are we going?

1392
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,390
Recently,

1393
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,820
we spent time
with elders in Chilgok.

1394
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,530
We also spent time
with Bo Gum and Sang Yi.

1395
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,060
- So we didn't have time together?
- Right.

1396
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,800
This time, we'll go on...

1397
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,730
our own country vacation.

1398
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,270
'Country vacation?"

1399
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,800
(The theme of today's trip,
country vacation)

1400
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:53,180
(Vacation you enjoy peacefully
and quietly in the countryside)

1401
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,180
- Then are we just hanging out?
- Yes, we can relax.

1402
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,550
The base camp isn't far
from here either.

1403
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,150
- Really?
- It's a place where you can feel...

1404
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,720
the charm
of a quiet fishing village.

1405
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,820
It's Ganghwa Island, Incheon.

1406
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,290
- Ganghwa Island?
- That's very close.

1407
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,360
- You can find good eels there.
- This is it.

1408
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,490
- That's right.
- Gosh.

1409
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:09,860
We'll go there on our own.

1410
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,030
Your managers will have...

1411
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:14,760
the day off today.
They have been working hard.

1412
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,130
- I heard that he was going home.
- Yes.

1413
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,500
- Really?
- As it's a country vacation,

1414
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,170
we'll enjoy quiet time together
and make good memories.

1415
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,470
- We should make good memories.
- Do you really mean "quiet?"

1416
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,210
There won't be any competitive games
waiting for us, right?

1417
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,440
- We have our own way of doing it.
- Of course.

1418
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,210
Could you show us
what you packed for the trip?

1419
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,320
You asked us beforehand.

1420
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,420
"If there's free time,
what would you want to do?"

1421
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,520
- That's right.
- From that side...

1422
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:38,990
It's nothing big.

1423
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,360
- What did you bring?
- Since I like games very much,

1424
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:42,820
I bought one.

1425
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,160
- You bought a game console?
- On the Internet.

1426
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:46,330
- You bought a game on the Internet?
- On the Internet.

1427
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,530
We always play games
with bottle caps.

1428
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,930
I wanted something fancier.

1429
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,170
- That's why.
- Is there a curling game?

1430
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,140
- I found this.
- For bottle caps?

1431
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,300
It's called Mini Curling Board Game.

1432
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,740
You can play on the board
with different types...

1433
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,810
of bottle caps.

1434
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,680
- Is it Bottle Cap Curling?
- I have this.

1435
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,740
I've been wanting to play it recently,
and I bought it.

1436
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,750
An egg carton?

1437
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,050
- This is...
- What's that?

1438
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,180
- It's Table Tennis Ball Bingo.
- It's an egg carton.

1439
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,450
You throw the balls
of the same color.

1440
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,150
- He really bought games.
- I did.

1441
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,190
Gosh, he's amazing.

1442
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:14,520
I bought them out of my own pocket.

1443
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,460
- And this is...
- What's that?

1444
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,990
(Items keep coming out
from Sae Ho's bag.)

1445
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:19,430
He has so many things.

1446
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,560
Whenever we play Shoe Throw,

1447
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,900
our scores are always ambiguous.

1448
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,470
- That's impressive.
- Unbelievable.

1449
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,740
What is it?

1450
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,200
- Is it for the scores?
- Do they sell things like this?

1451
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,440
When we play Shoe Throw...

1452
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,210
Didn't he go overboard?

1453
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,680
(A target board with numbers
for Shoe Throw)

1454
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,780
This is amazing.

1455
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:39,080
- He's as good as the staff.
- This is amazing.

1456
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,580
- Throw your shoe.
- This is great.

1457
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,720
Try and throw your shoe.

1458
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,350
(He even simulates the game.)

1459
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,320
We don't have to make it.

1460
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,460
- Ten points.
- When it lands here,

1461
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,730
- Is the total 40 points?
- it's 30 points.

1462
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:51,990
- I see.
- Give it a try.

1463
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,900
Sae Ho, have you been very bored?

1464
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,600
- I mean...
- Like this. He won 20 points.

1465
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,630
This is fun.

1466
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,840
- The quality is much higher.
- We can play like this.

1467
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,340
Don't tell us to
pick up our shoes...

1468
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,010
after throwing it.

1469
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:10,010
(Throw your shoe and pick it up.)

1470
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,180
(Still, it's so much fun.)

1471
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,450
If we want to pick someone
to make ramyeon later,

1472
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:16,590
this would be perfect to use.

1473
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,420
- This is of high quality.
- Sae Ho, you're amazing.

1474
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,960
I've been resting at home,
so I had time on my hands.

1475
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:25,290
- Why did you pack so many?
- This one.

1476
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,200
- Toiletries. It's my underwear.
- How many do you have?

1477
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,470
Your underwear? Let me take it.

1478
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,830
- Let me see your underwear.
- What for?

1479
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,200
Let me see how big it is.

1480
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,470
This is a celebrity's...

1481
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,510
(He grabs Se Yoon's underwear.)

1482
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,440
Hey.

1483
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,570
(Making a run for it)

1484
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,540
(A big size)

1485
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,410
(I've never seen this size before.)

1486
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,050
(Bookku Ddoong)

1487
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,450
My underwear.

1488
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,550
A celebrity's What's In My Bag?
An underwear.

1489
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,590
(Fluttering)

1490
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:51,690
Why you...

1491
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,060
(Underwear 1, 2, 3)

1492
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:55,760
How many pairs of underwear
did he bring?

1493
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,890
(A party of big underwear)

1494
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,960
(Making a run for it the 2nd time)

1495
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,130
How many pairs...

1496
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,030
How many pairs of underwear
did he bring?

1497
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,070
All of your underwear is big.

1498
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,640
How many pairs of underwear
did he bring?

1499
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,470
It's as big as my towel
for the face.

1500
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,210
Se Yoon, it's as big
as a towel at my house.

1501
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,370
Let me know
if you don't have enough towels.

1502
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,340
- I can...
- This is cute.

1503
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:16,110
I brought a pair of running shoes.

1504
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,280
- Really? Let's see.
- I brought some massage products.

1505
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,780
Why did you bring a pair of shoes?
Are you going to run?

1506
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,820
- A pair of running shoes.
- What?

1507
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,190
- Running shoes.
- You're serious.

1508
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,750
These are shoes that I run in.

1509
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,320
Why didn't you tell me?
We could've run together.

1510
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,760
I'm running a full marathon
in November.

1511
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,160
- Really?
- Really? A marathon?

1512
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,190
A full marathon?

1513
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,930
This is my foam roller.

1514
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,330
(By the way, DinDin...)

1515
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,530
(We aren't interested
in your running items.)

1516
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:38,600
Also...

1517
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,970
- This is...
- This is DinDin's underwear.

1518
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,170
- What are you doing? No, it's not.
- It's so tiny.

1519
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,740
(A napkin?)

1520
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,980
Only one leg would fit in it.

1521
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,480
- My son.
- Stop it.

1522
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,110
- It's smaller than my son's.
- Stop it.

1523
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,220
(Hopping)

1524
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,120
- Stop it.
- How about hand-me-downs?

1525
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,890
- I'll bring you my son's underwear.
- What's wrong with you?

1526
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,720
- It's smaller than my son's.
- It only fits one leg.

1527
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,360
What age is this for?

1528
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:04,990
- I wear it underneath.
- What's this?

1529
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:05,990
It's for a baby.

1530
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,300
Try these on. These look great.

1531
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,460
(Meanwhile, Sae Ho finds
a new item.)

1532
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:12,700
(For some reason,
he looks familiar.)

1533
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,270
"Where are you going?"

1534
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:18,140
"Let me come with you."

1535
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,440
(7 hours later)

1536
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,810
(He actually ended up
going with him.)

1537
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,050
(DinDin: Shall we speed up a little?)

1538
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,450
(Se Yoon: My calves hurt. Even the shins.)

1539
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,550
(DinDin: That's normal.)

1540
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,360
(Se Yoon: I can't bear it.
DinDin: Yes, you can.)

1541
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:37,530
(Se Yoon and DinDin's running
of the inferno)

1542
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,030
(Coming soon)

1543
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,760
Jong Min, is this your only bag?

1544
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,370
- It's for fishing.
- Fishing?

1545
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,400
I brought it just in case.

1546
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,370
- Isn't there a reservoir?
- Yes.

1547
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,770
Okay, it's KOYOTE underwear
this time.

1548
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,610
- What's KOYOTE underwear?
- What's this?

1549
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,870
I don't know the passcode.

1550
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:53,910
(Shouting)

1551
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,880
- That's incredible.
- What?

1552
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,950
- This is...
- It's a cookie.

1553
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,280
I really think...

1554
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,120
Please confiscate it.

1555
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,590
It's the same one
I had in my pocket last time.

1556
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:07,020
(Jong Min had hidden
a chocolate cookie in his pocket.)

1557
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,060
(Tap)

1558
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,660
(Does he still have it?)

1559
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,700
Is it the same cookie?

1560
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,030
Jong Min, you packed a lot.

1561
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,500
You packed a lot of things.

1562
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,040
He doesn't have underwear either.

1563
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,700
Why isn't there KOYOTE underwear?

1564
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,000
I don't wear underwear.

1565
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,270
(Suddenly, he admits
that he wears no underwear.)

1566
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:26,070
KOYOTE members don't wear underwear.

1567
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,440
(Luggage check is completed
without any KOYOTE underwear.)

1568
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:31,010
You take country vacation to escape
from the busy everyday life...

1569
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,320
and disconnect
from the world to relax.

1570
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,750
Considering that,

1571
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,920
you seem to have
too much worldly luggage.

1572
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,990
There he goes again.

1573
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,820
- But I bought all of these.
- We'll reduce your luggage.

1574
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,330
I don't want to reduce it.

1575
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,630
- What's going on?
- What's this?

1576
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,200
- What's going on here?
- Why should I reduce it?

1577
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,300
He's old enough to carry
what he wants.

1578
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,370
I don't listen to my parents
anymore.

1579
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,400
What does that make Jong Min?

1580
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:55,900
He's almost 50.

1581
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:57,740
I'll take out my things.

1582
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,040
(Kim Jong Min, age 47, listens
to the director.)

1583
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,880
You know the newspaper game, right?

1584
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,610
All the members will stand
on the newspaper.

1585
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,210
You win once you stay on it
for five seconds.

1586
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,020
The game consists of three levels.

1587
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,450
Every time you fail,
we'll take out two people's luggage.

1588
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,950
- Two suitcases.
- You'll remove the entire suitcase?

1589
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:13,990
Yes.

1590
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,360
- This entire suitcase?
- Yes.

1591
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,460
Then how will we wash ourselves?

1592
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,790
What about our underwear?

1593
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,430
Both Se Yoon and DinDin have
underwear.

1594
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:21,830
- I can't wear Se Yoon's underwear.
- Wear someone else's underwear?

1595
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:23,970
I have three extra pairs
of underwear.

1596
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,830
Let's do this first.
Come to the center.

1597
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,140
Let's start with Level One.

1598
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,640
This one is very easy.

1599
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,510
I can stay in the center like this.

1600
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,910
For this one,
we can stand close like this.

1601
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,340
We're ready.

1602
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,710
All right.

1603
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,350
(Huddled)

1604
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,750
- Start.
- Start.

1605
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:47,360
One, two, three, four, five.

1606
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,020
- Okay, we got it.
- Goodness.

1607
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,590
He counted five seconds so slowly.

1608
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,660
Since we made it,
can we get two suitcases?

1609
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,030
- You get back two suitcases.
- This one is critical.

1610
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,070
- Everyone, this is Level Two.
- Let's do it.

1611
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,370
- Six people can't stand on this.
- It's nearly impossible.

1612
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,410
- We can carry 2 on our shoulders.
- You want to go 1st?

1613
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:05,770
With 2 people on our shoulders,
1 of you step on my feet.

1614
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,740
Can I step on your feet like this?

1615
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,680
One of us can hold the balance
while stepping on someone's feet.

1616
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:10,910
I'll be on someone's shoulders.

1617
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:12,610
Seon Ho will get on Se Yoon.

1618
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,580
Joon, put DinDin on your shoulders.

1619
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,850
- Take off your shoes.
- Okay.

1620
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,220
- What about us?
- We will hang onto someone.

1621
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,220
Hang onto someone? Okay.

1622
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,090
When you're fat, you always have
to carry someone on your back.

1623
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,820
When you're fat, you always have
to carry someone.

1624
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,160
When you're short, you always have
to hang onto someone.

1625
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,330
The only advantage is
riding shotgun.

1626
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,860
That's the only one.

1627
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,100
You pay the same price,
but your underwear is bigger.

1628
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,770
- That's true.
- Okay.

1629
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,200
- Let's go.
- We must start when they get up.

1630
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,270
Or it will get too heavy.

1631
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,540
- I'm standing up. Are you ready?
- Yes.

1632
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,910
- One, two, three.
- As expected.

1633
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,540
- It's a leg exercise.
- It's okay now.

1634
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,710
Don't kill the vibe.

1635
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,110
- Hurry up and come up.
- Goodness.

1636
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:46,380
You have to do it right away,
or you'll fall.

1637
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,020
- Okay.
- How will you do it?

1638
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,220
- You have to climb up.
- Stand up.

1639
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,690
Se Yoon, stand up. That's right.

1640
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:53,320
Joon, come forward.

1641
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,790
- I'll get on the newspaper.
- Go ahead.

1642
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,290
- Okay.
- They're in.

1643
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,330
I have no one to hold onto.

1644
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:58,630
Sae Ho, step here.

1645
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:01,730
(It's too narrow
for Sae Ho to step on.)

1646
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:02,730
Stay still.

1647
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:03,770
Sae Ho, step here.

1648
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,600
(He barely puts his foot on it.)

1649
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,340
By the way, if we fall,

1650
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,810
we won't be able to come
to the next shoot.

1651
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,480
- Here we go. We'll start.
- You have to say start.

1652
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,880
- We'll start.
- Yes.

1653
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,680
(Packed)

1654
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,680
- Gosh.
- One, two...

1655
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,720
(Jong Min is hanging in there
only on one foot.)

1656
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,720
three,

1657
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,820
four,

1658
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,590
- five.
- Okay!

1659
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,820
- We did it.
- We did it.

1660
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,220
- Catch me, Jong Min.
- Okay.

1661
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,590
- Hold on.
- I'll put you down.

1662
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:33,090
- I'll put you down.
- Go down.

1663
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,430
- Don't move.
- Go down.

1664
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:35,760
Don't hold.

1665
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,500
The next one is the problem now.

1666
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,630
(Meanwhile, he's very comfortable.)

1667
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,000
Where's Seon Ho?

1668
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,200
Seon Ho?

1669
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,470
- Seon Ho!
- Seon Ho isn't here.

1670
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:45,640
Here's Seon Ho.

1671
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,040
You're amazing.

1672
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,040
(To Se Yoon,
Seon Ho is just a feather.)

1673
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,810
- It's difficult now.
- Next.

1674
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,710
(Stage 3: A quarter of a newspaper)

1675
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,020
The next one is really easy.

1676
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,480
- How is it easy?
- Did you see that?

1677
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,950
"The King and the Clown."

1678
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,550
The tower was three levels high.

1679
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,060
- My goodness.
- It's possible.

1680
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,230
Se Yoon will carry Jong Min
who will carry DinDin.

1681
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,630
You just need to hold each other.
What do you think?

1682
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,500
- Too hard?
- It's not a bad idea.

1683
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,600
- Or something like this.
- This...

1684
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,900
He carried two people
on his shoulders last time.

1685
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,640
- It's the shoulders.
- One on each side.

1686
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,870
DinDin and I can be carried.

1687
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,210
I'll carry both of them,
and you can hang onto them.

1688
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,380
Hang onto them.

1689
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,810
- Yes.
- And the last person...

1690
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,480
- can step on my feet.
- Okay.

1691
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,380
- Step on my feet.
- Okay.

1692
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,880
- Would it work? Let's try.
- But...

1693
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,650
- Hold me.
- One person should go up first.

1694
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:31,890
- I'll go up first.
- Okay.

1695
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,020
Position yourself.

1696
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,160
- Go up.
- Please lift me up.

1697
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,690
- One, two, three.
- Come up.

1698
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,790
I'm going to stand up.

1699
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,260
- Hold on.
- I'm going to stand up.

1700
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,490
- Are you done?
- I'll get up.

1701
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,600
(The upper level is ready.)

1702
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,900
- Okay.
- I'll get up.

1703
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,600
One, two, up.

1704
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:45,600
- Okay.
- It worked.

1705
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,070
- It worked.
- His strength...

1706
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,970
(He stood up!)

1707
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:51,810
- His strength...
- Amazing.

1708
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:53,340
- He's so strong.
- Go on.

1709
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,410
It worked.

1710
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:56,580
(Meanwhile, Seon Ho is terrified.)

1711
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,580
- He's so strong.
- It's crazy.

1712
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,780
(Holding tightly)

1713
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,120
- He's so strong.
- Stand up here.

1714
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,850
Should we have removed
the shoes first?

1715
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,320
(Wobbling)

1716
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,390
I think we should do this quickly.

1717
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:08,390
- Where's the center?
- Hold on.

1718
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:10,830
(He steps on the newspaper.)

1719
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,690
Let's go right away.

1720
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:13,900
We'll go!

1721
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,960
Hold my shoulders.

1722
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,260
We'll go.

1723
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,470
You can lift your feet.

1724
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:19,800
(The newspaper is full
even with one of their feet.)

1725
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,840
- Are you ready, Jong Min?
- Ready,

1726
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm ready.

1727
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,210
start!

1728
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:27,410
Start!

1729
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,880
- One, two,
- It's working.

1730
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,210
three,
(But his foot is unstable.)

1731
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,310
- It's working.
- four,

1732
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,380
(Holding tightly)

1733
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,580
five!

1734
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,420
(They cleared stage 3.)

1735
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,990
Put me down!

1736
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,320
- Be careful.
- Hold me.

1737
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,090
Wait. Step aside.

1738
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,130
Take a picture of us.

1739
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,130
(I should get a picture.)

1740
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,160
Take a picture of us.

1741
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:51,570
(Title: Seyoons, Unshakable Comfort)

1742
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:52,900
Be careful.

1743
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,140
Moon Se Yoon!

1744
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,800
- Moon Se Yoon!
- You're amazing.

1745
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,370
This worked.

1746
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,080
- I think he could carry two more.
- Two adults.

1747
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,140
But he was so stable.

1748
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,210
It was the best.

1749
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:05,650
That's amazing.

1750
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:06,780
- It didn't...
- Did we protect everything?

1751
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,150
- Yes. That's right.
- All right.

1752
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:09,880
It's amazing.

1753
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,050
We'll start the country vacation
in good spirits.

1754
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,020
- Okay!
- Great.

1755
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,590
- Let's get going.
- Okay.

1756
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,290
Goodbye, city.

1757
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,260
(Let's leave for the blue sea)

1758
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,270
(Let's escape this busy city)

1759
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,840
- The past
- Let's go on a country vacation!

1760
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,640
(They head off on a country vacation
with all their luggage.)

1761
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,180
(Everyone's on board.)

1762
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,310
We're going!

1763
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,550
- Let's go!
- You stay in the suffocating city.

1764
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,280
Let's go on a country vacation!

1765
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,450
(We're leaving
on a country vacation.)

1766
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,720
You know we're using
Jong Min's card, right?

1767
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:49,460
(Heading off
on a healing country vacation)

1768
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,590
But do people...

1769
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,960
actually go on a country vacation?

1770
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,830
- They do. Many people do.
- They do.

1771
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,100
Hotel vacation
versus country vacation.

1772
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,900
- Definitely country vacation.
- Really?

1773
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,900
- Definitely.
- It's really relaxing.

1774
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,200
- Really?
- If you...

1775
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,940
really like it so much,

1776
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,440
you could go on a country vacation
as your honeymoon.

1777
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,010
A countryside in France.

1778
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,040
You'll go to the countryside
in France.

1779
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,280
Isn't it next week?

1780
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,350
Next week.

1781
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,380
It's crazy with the news...

1782
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:15,220
that you'll be absent
in 2 Days and 1 Night.

1783
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,390
"How could there be 2 Days and 1 Night
without Kim Jong Min?"

1784
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,820
- This is the one before you go.
- It feels very weird.

1785
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,490
- I know.
- I won't be on the next one.

1786
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,360
Play the sleeping outdoors game
even on your honeymoon.

1787
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,330
- Should we?
- Sleeping outdoors would be nice.

1788
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,730
Who's coming that day?

1789
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,200
They're looking for someone
whose IQ is less than 100.

1790
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,570
Right. The balance must be kept.

1791
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:33,570
You need to bring an animal.

1792
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,340
We have some carps as candidates.

1793
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:38,840
This is today's guest,

1794
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,380
a golden carp.

1795
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,110
Our members...

1796
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,550
are energetic
when we start in Seoul.

1797
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:48,080
- It's really nice.
- I'm grateful.

1798
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,820
Is this going to be a healing trip?

1799
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,320
Right. Let's relax.

1800
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:55,090
What I really want to do
on a country vacation...

1801
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:58,030
is grilling kimchi with pork...

1802
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,460
and eat...

1803
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,200
- something nice.
- That would be amazing.

1804
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,830
Se Yoon grills meat amazingly.

1805
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,570
And we could just chat.
Isn't that right?

1806
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,270
- Right.
- Taking a nap on a wooden bench.

1807
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:07,300
You should lie down
on the wooden bench.

1808
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,400
This weather is perfect...

1809
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,210
- to lie on the wooden bench.
- Right.

1810
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:13,210
- It's the best.
- I think it would be nice...

1811
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:16,110
to walk with you. I want to walk.

1812
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,310
That's relaxing.

1813
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,110
I want to go fishing too.

1814
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,880
Jong Min and DinDin could fish.

1815
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,320
Seon Ho and I could play catch.

1816
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,590
- Catch.
- Catch.

1817
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,920
Se Yoon...

1818
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,320
Shall we take a nap?

1819
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:29,860
Shall we?

1820
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,430
Let's take a nap
after eating some watermelons.

1821
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,090
- That would be nice.
- Yes.

1822
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,500
Let's play some board games too.
We brought some games.

1823
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,800
We've said all these,

1824
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,870
but what if we don't get to do
any of them?

1825
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:40,130
I don't think we'll do any.

1826
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,770
We might do something this time.

1827
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,540
You never know.

1828
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,070
I have a good feeling now, but...

1829
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:46,840
(Let's enjoy it for now!)

1830
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,080
Moonchild.

1831
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,840
Moonchild.

1832
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:53,010
The Moons rock in summer.

1833
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,850
(Moonchild's surname is Moon?)

1834
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:04,930
(That image is fading away now)

1835
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,360
(The thrilling first kiss moment)

1836
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:11,900
(The sun shines in full
beneath the sky)

1837
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,730
(Laughing)

1838
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,970
(It's a horrifying first kiss
no one would want to dream about.)

1839
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:18,540
- I really...
- Can you hear me?

1840
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

1841
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,780
What is it?

1842
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,710
Are you having a fun time?

1843
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,350
Yes. Let's go party time.
We're having fun.

1844
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,080
- What is he trying to do?
- What is it?

1845
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,020
Why don't we play
a light nonsense quiz...

1846
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,350
for the snack money?

1847
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:33,990
- I'd love that.
- That's nice.

1848
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,260
(Nonsense quiz?)

1849
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,960
Good. Do we answer from here?

1850
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:40,960
Somewhere in the car you're in,

1851
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,200
there's a mini safe
with the snack money.

1852
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,730
(Searching right away)

1853
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:47,840
Hold on.

1854
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,900
There's a safe?

1855
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,070
(They've been chatting
without knowing that.)

1856
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,140
- It's here!
- It's here.

1857
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:55,710
(Searching)

1858
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,650
(The mini safe
was in the glove box.)

1859
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:00,880
It has numbers.

1860
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,980
- Let me see it.
- We found it.

1861
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,950
Every time you get
an answer correct,

1862
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,890
we'll tell you one number...

1863
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:08,590
of the 4-digit passcode.

1864
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:10,560
- I'll just open it.
- Okay.

1865
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,290
Don't do that.

1866
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:15,000
You have one chance
to say the answer for each question.

1867
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,630
You can think about it...

1868
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:18,900
and tell me the answer.

1869
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,400
- Okay.
- Okay.

1870
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,600
Give us the question.

1871
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,200
Here's the first question.

1872
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,670
It's a nonsense question.
Let's answer it.

1873
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,170
Please give us an easy one first.

1874
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,050
Who is the person connecting
Lee Chung Yong and Ki Sung Yueng?

1875
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:32,280
- Lee Chung Yong?
- Yes.

1876
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:34,150
The person connecting
soccer players...

1877
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:35,920
Lee Chung Yong and Ki Sung Yueng.

1878
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:37,950
They both have "Yong."

1879
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,150
Yong Yong.

1880
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:42,120
Two Yong, Young Two,
Two Dragon, Two...

1881
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:43,620
Lee Yong.

1882
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,460
We have to be careful.
We have one chance.

1883
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,200
- Lee Yong Sik?
- Yong Da Ri?

1884
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,960
- Lee Yong...
- Lee Yong Jin?

1885
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,270
Is it a soccer player?

1886
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:55,840
Could you tell us
what the person's profession is?

1887
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,070
Please stick to that.

1888
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,410
(Shameless)

1889
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,510
We'll give you one more minute
to discuss.

1890
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:02,110
Please give us a hint.
What genre is it?

1891
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:03,580
Is the person a sportsman?

1892
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,980
You have to be mindful of that.

1893
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,280
You'll be able to figure it out
if you imagine it.

1894
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,220
The person connecting
Lee Chung Yong and Ki Sung Yueng.

1895
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:12,420
Lee Eul Yong!

1896
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:14,490
Lee Eul Yong!

1897
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,290
(That's right. Lee Eul Yong.)

1898
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:20,090
- The answer...
- Okay.

1899
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,400
is Lee Eul Yong.

1900
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,200
(Answer: Lee Eul Yong)

1901
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,070
- That was amazing.
- It's amazing.

1902
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:28,740
- Cho Sae Ho.
- The first answer is correct.

1903
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:31,040
That was nice.

1904
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:32,370
It worked.

1905
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:33,640
That's Cho Sae Ho.

1906
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,140
That makes sense.

1907
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,880
- Lee Eul Yong.
- They should tell us.

1908
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,080
What's the first digit?

1909
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,880
- It's zero.
- Zero.

1910
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,050
- Zero.
- Zero.

1911
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,620
That was great.

1912
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,020
That was funny. Lee Eul Yong.

1913
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,620
Give us the next one!

1914
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,130
- Jay Park.
- Jay Park?

1915
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,260
If Jay Park enters university again,
what do you call that?

1916
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,330
- Jay Park enters university again?
- Jay Park enters university again?

1917
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,630
(It has to be a clear answer
like earlier.)

1918
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:02,570
Jay Park!

1919
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:03,900
- Jay Park.
- Jay Park.

1920
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,210
(They got the answer again!)

1921
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,310
(Why are they so good?)

1922
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:09,610
(It's a clear answer.)

1923
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:12,810
The answer to the second question...

1924
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:14,480
is Jay Park.

1925
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,020
(Jay Park: Readmission)

1926
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,620
- That's right.
- It's amazing.

1927
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,890
- We're good.
- Jay Park.

1928
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,320
Correct!

1929
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,390
It's amazing.

1930
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,390
What's the next digit?

1931
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,460
The second digit is eight.

1932
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,600
Zero, eight.

1933
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,200
Here's the next question.

1934
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:31,300
If a dragon gets surprised,
how do you say that...

1935
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,430
in two syllables?

1936
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,630
- What?
- When a dragon gets surprised?

1937
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,070
When a dragon gets surprised?

1938
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:37,310
- Isn't it ttiyong?
- Ttiyong.

1939
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,040
- There's ttiyong.
- Ttiyong.

1940
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,380
- Ttiyong.
- I think it's ttiyong.

1941
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,340
- I think it's correct.
- Let's go with that.

1942
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:44,380
- It's correct.
- Should we say it right away?

1943
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,350
The answer to the third question...

1944
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:48,550
Let's go party time. Ttiyong.

1945
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,090
Ttiyong is correct.

1946
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:52,420
- What?
- Well done.

1947
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,990
- What?
- What's this? It's so easy.

1948
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,660
- Good.
- It's so easy.

1949
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:01,100
The third digit is one.

1950
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,100
What?

1951
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,100
We'd open it if we try
all the numbers now.

1952
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,730
- Right.
- We already won.

1953
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:06,730
That's right.

1954
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,100
We'll have the last question.

1955
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,970
- Here's the last question.
- Okay.

1956
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:13,410
What's the name of Koong's daughter?

1957
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,380
- What?
- Koong.

1958
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,880
- Koong?
- Like banging your head.

1959
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,980
Koong's daughter.

1960
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,410
- Kungfu.
- Kungfu.

1961
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,850
It has to be a name
for the daughter.

1962
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,050
- Kung...
- Gosh.

1963
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:27,690
- The last name would be Kung.
- Right.

1964
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,520
Oh, it's Sha Bah Rah!
From "Kung Ddari Sha Bah Rah."

1965
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,490
- It's "Kung Ddari Sha Bah Rah!"
- "Kung Ddari Sha Bah Rah!"

1966
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:35,530
(Kung's daughter is Sha Bah Rah?)

1967
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,130
It's "Kung Ddari Sha Bah Rah!"

1968
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:39,200
Gosh!

1969
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:41,740
Kung's daughter is Sha Bah Rah.

1970
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,210
- Sha Bah Rah!
- We got it!

1971
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,310
- That is correct.
- Yes!

1972
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:47,010
(Sha Bah Rah is correct.)

1973
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:50,310
(They easily win the snack money!)

1974
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:51,950
- Gosh, what was that?
- Well,

1975
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:53,610
we're on top of them, aren't we?

1976
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,020
Kung's daughter!

1977
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,520
The fourth number.

1978
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,850
- It's 0818?
- The 4th number is 8.

1979
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:00,960
- Okay.
- It's eight?

1980
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:02,760
This is G-Dragon's birthday.

1981
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,760
- You're right.
- August 18 is his birthday.

1982
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,960
He was born on August 18, 1988.

1983
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,560
What? It's making me wonder.
Could it be him?

1984
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:12,670
After having Park Bo Gum
and Lee Sang Yi as guests.

1985
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,740
Could it be another guest?
That can't be true.

1986
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:15,740
Right.

1987
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,740
Isn't he fishing at Ganghwa Island?

1988
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:18,740
All of a sudden?

1989
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,410
Everyone,

1990
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,980
do you know what
the passcode 0818 refers to?

1991
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:26,210
August 18 was that day.

1992
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,580
- What was it?
- The day of the first episode...

1993
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,790
when our new members joined.

1994
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:32,450
Really?

1995
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:33,450
Right.

1996
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,620
- Really?
- How did you know that?

1997
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:37,560
- You should know this.
- The new members didn't know,

1998
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,660
but DinDin remembered this.

1999
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:39,990
- You should know this.
- Goosh.

2000
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,960
I've opened it.

2001
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,670
- What's inside?
- What? It's ten dollars.

2002
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:46,030
- Come on!
- Come on!

2003
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:47,200
What? It's ten dollars.

2004
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,140
(It's just ten dollars?)

2005
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,470
(Disappointed)

2006
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:52,570
- What? Come on!
- Come on!

2007
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,180
- It's just ten dollars?
- What can we do with that?

2008
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:57,750
- Inflation is serious these days.
- What is going on?

2009
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:00,050
Excuse me,
there are people saying that...

2010
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:01,580
ten dollars is too little.

2011
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,820
- Please...
- All we can get is ice cream.

2012
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,220
discuss this matter...

2013
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:06,850
and come to a conclusion...

2014
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,620
with either 100 or 200 dollars.

2015
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,820
Thank you.

2016
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,830
Giving us ten dollars is so harsh.
We have this many people here.

2017
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:16,160
We can each get
some ice cream with that.

2018
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,430
We can use 1.5 dollars each.

2019
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:20,630
That won't be enough
even for ice cream.

2020
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:21,770
(There's one man who has become
very quiet.)

2021
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,940
(His eyes move quickly.)

2022
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,510
Oh, never mind.

2023
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:31,050
(He suddenly picks up the camera?)

2024
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:33,810
We'll give them a surprise quiz too.

2025
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,120
We prepared a surprise quiz
for you as well.

2026
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,390
The battery of the action cam
has been removed...

2027
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:41,560
and placed into the safe
with a passcode.

2028
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,420
You must guess the passcode
to open the safe...

2029
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,490
and use the action cam. Thank you.

2030
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:49,000
There are no hints for the passcode.

2031
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,360
(Take a taste of your own medicine.)

2032
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,870
There are no hints.

2033
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,000
"There are no hints."

2034
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:56,500
(Flustered)

2035
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,270
You have to film with that.

2036
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,470
You have to use it.

2037
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,210
It has been locked up
with a passcode.

2038
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,380
If you do not raise the money
to 20 dollars,

2039
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,380
the passcode will not be given.

2040
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,120
Please respond right away.

2041
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,220
If there is no response,
it will go up to 30 dollars.

2042
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:12,550
Tell them they will be given
two minutes.

2043
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,990
- You will be given two minutes.
- Is this a hostage situation?

2044
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:16,590
(The camera has been taken hostage
due to the small amount of money.)

2045
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:21,500
No response?
I have opened the window.

2046
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:24,700
You see this, right?

2047
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:27,840
(The level of the threat
goes higher.)

2048
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,540
(You see this well, right?)

2049
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,170
I believe the battery
of the action cam...

2050
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,310
would be a lot more expensive.

2051
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,880
"It will be dropped soon."

2052
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,810
"None of your thoughts..."

2053
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,810
"will be considered."

2054
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:41,820
(An intense confrontation)

2055
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,750
You guys are doing great.

2056
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:47,050
We have our own conditions.

2057
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:48,590
We will give you...

2058
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,060
- another nonsense quiz.
- Okay.

2059
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:52,060
You will be given five dollars more
if you get it right.

2060
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,060
Okay.

2061
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,330
- It should be 10 dollars.
- If it isn't 10 dollars,

2062
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:56,360
I will not tell you
the passcode for the action cam.

2063
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:00,970
What is the game that is
always played with suspicion?

2064
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,140
The game that is always played...

2065
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,340
- with suspicion?
- Suspicion?

2066
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,070
It's definitely the Game of Wits,
but that would be too obvious.

2067
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:09,340
It's something else
as it's a nonsense quiz.

2068
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:11,280
- Does it have "Game" in the answer?
- What could it be?

2069
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:13,410
The game that is always played
with suspicion?

2070
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,580
Hwatu.

2071
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:16,050
Gonggi.

2072
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,220
This one is hard.

2073
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:21,420
- A game played with suspicion?
- I don't have a clue.

2074
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,860
Here's the hint. It's a board game.

2075
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,530
- It's a board game?
- It's a board game?

2076
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:27,230
What was this one called again?
The one you push blocks.

2077
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:31,730
- Jenga! It's Jenga!
- It's Jenga?

2078
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:32,730
As it sounds like,
"Is it that person?"

2079
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:34,130
The answer is Jenga.

2080
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:35,140
Correct.

2081
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:37,940
(They earn 15 dollars in total
for snacks.)

2082
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,670
- Gosh, that was amazing.
- Nice one!

2083
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:41,640
Can we stop by
a convenience store on the way?

2084
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,410
We can use our money
however we want to.

2085
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:45,180
- Right.
- Today...

2086
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,250
We're deep in the countryside.

2087
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,280
(They have almost reached
their destination.)

2088
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,320
We're almost there.

2089
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,520
Aren't there grocery stores
at places like these?

2090
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,590
- Supermarkets.
- Supermarkets.

2091
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:52,890
You have to go to
those kinds of places.

2092
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:55,420
That's the vibe of the countryside.

2093
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:57,490
There's one right here.

2094
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:00,430
- There's a supermarket.
- Right. Let's go there.

2095
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:01,430
(A local supermarket
is spotted right away.)

2096
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,860
We should walk in
after parking the car.

2097
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,030
Right. Let's go.

2098
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:05,930
Let's walk in.

2099
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:08,600
Let's get our snacks first.

2100
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:10,500
This place looks lovely.

2101
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,940
We're deep in the countryside.

2102
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,310
Gosh!

2103
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:15,410
I love the vibes of this place.

2104
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,310
I love these places.

2105
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:20,150
So that is what it's called.

2106
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,320
Gosh!

2107
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,720
(They head to the supermarket
to buy snacks.)

2108
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

2109
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,360
Are you going for ice cream?

2110
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:29,760
Yes.

2111
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,760
I want this one!

2112
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:33,690
- Should I get ice cream too?
- I got mine.

2113
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:35,530
Can I get ice cream?

2114
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,400
- How much is that?
- I don't know.

2115
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:38,830
(Total budget, 15 dollars)

2116
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,300
This shouldn't be...

2117
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,340
- I'll look inside first.
- too expensive.

2118
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,340
I'll look inside.

2119
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,840
What is all this? What's going on?

2120
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:47,940
Are you going wild? What's wrong?

2121
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,410
- It's 4.5 dollars.
- It's 4.5 dollars?

2122
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:52,910
- What's this?
- How much is this one?

2123
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:55,050
- It's 1.4 dollars.
- Right. I can have this, right?

2124
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,780
- You can.
- It's perfect.

2125
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,050
It's a price...

2126
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:59,690
- It can be eaten later.
- that suits me.

2127
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,990
- Hey.
- What are you doing...

2128
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,090
with the ramyeon?

2129
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,220
Are you going to cook some?

2130
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:04,530
- I'm going to eat it raw.
- How much do we have?

2131
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,590
Let's just have other snacks.

2132
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:06,660
I'll yield.

2133
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,630
You have nothing to yield.
You don't have any money.

2134
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,260
The Bravo Cone.

2135
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,870
Should I go for this one
to cheer up?

2136
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:13,730
(Ice cream, 1.4 dollars times 4)

2137
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,300
(DinDin goes for a snack.)

2138
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:21,380
(He can't give up on ramyeon.)

2139
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,880
Well, 15 dollars should be enough.

2140
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,310
It's enough.

2141
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,150
- It's 2.2 dollars.
- How much is this one?

2142
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,680
It's 2 dollars.

2143
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,680
Oh, right.
I can get some ice cream as well.

2144
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,120
There's a reason why
it's loved for a long time.

2145
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,150
(While DinDin heads out
for some ice cream...)

2146
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,760
(Checking on the others)

2147
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,460
I have to get the ice cream.

2148
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:40,860
(Cup ramyeon for 1.2 dollars,
chocolate biscuits for 2.5 dollars)

2149
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,400
What is that?

2150
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:44,570
What?

2151
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,930
Why did you get two?

2152
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:47,940
Why have you become so greedy
for food after getting married?

2153
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:49,800
He got two.

2154
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,800
What?

2155
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,470
We have 1.3 dollars left.

2156
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,140
- That's the most expensive one.
- We have can have more.

2157
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,480
We have money left.

2158
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,910
(Relieved)

2159
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:01,080
Just give me one.

2160
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,080
(Just give me one.)

2161
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,420
(Snack receipt)

2162
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,050
(Finishing it in one bite)

2163
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:09,520
- Have a good day.
- Thank you, sir.

2164
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,820
Shall we get going?

2165
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,160
Will we find a nice house
if we walk down?

2166
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,800
(Eating the raw ramyeon)

2167
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:20,570
Gosh, it's pretty.

2168
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:22,070
We're in the countryside!

2169
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,940
It feels like we're on a trip today.

2170
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:25,810
This is the best!

2171
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,380
Gosh, this is amazing.

2172
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,480
There were a lot of flowers planted.

2173
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:32,010
Right.

2174
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:34,250
It looks like a hanok.

2175
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:36,280
- It's nice.
- It's a hanok.

2176
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:37,820
The house looks so pretty.

2177
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:39,650
The hanok looks amazing!

2178
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:41,290
- It's nice.
- It's nice.

2179
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:42,460
Gosh, what is this place?

2180
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:44,890
- It looks amazing.
- Gosh.

2181
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,260
- It's nice.
- It's nice.

2182
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,700
It's a house in the countryside.
It's a country vacation.

2183
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,900
We're already at the base camp?

2184
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,030
Have we ever arrived
at the base camp this early before?

2185
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:57,240
- Isn't it the first time?
- This is the base camp.

2186
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,310
Gosh.

2187
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:00,410
You can go in right away
and get some rest.

2188
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:01,580
- Gosh!
- Really?

2189
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,410
(We can rest?)

2190
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,410
- We can rest?
- Why are you being like this?

2191
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:06,850
Stop making us feel anxious.

2192
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:08,020
What are we doing at night?

2193
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:09,420
We won't feel anxious,
and we'll trust you.

2194
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,750
Just tell us why
you're being like this.

2195
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:11,990
(Let's hear why.)

2196
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:15,590
We wondered how it would look
for a real country vacation.

2197
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,520
- Us having fun for real?
- Right.

2198
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,760
- Really?
- Yes.

2199
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,960
Really? Let's do as we are told.

2200
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,630
- Let's rest when we are told to.
- Right.

2201
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:24,000
Gosh, this is nice.

2202
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:26,470
- It's nice.
- What is going on?

2203
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:27,530
(Excited)

2204
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,040
This must be the room.

2205
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:30,700
Gosh, this is nice.

2206
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:32,570
It's nice here.

2207
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,110
It's really nice.

2208
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:35,940
Gosh, it's nice!

2209
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:37,480
The house is amazing!

2210
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,880
Gosh!

2211
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:40,680
(Here is the base camp.)

2212
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:43,150
(A cozy living room like from
our grandmother's home.)

2213
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,380
The house is amazing.

2214
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,990
There are many rooms.

2215
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,290
(The main room looks warm.)

2216
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,890
- This is a storage room.
- This place is great.

2217
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,990
The kitchen is modern.

2218
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:57,930
There's only water.

2219
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:58,930
(The refrigerator is
the most important for this person)

2220
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:01,070
There are comfortable clothes here.

2221
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:03,000
- Are the clothes here for us?
- Should we get changed?

2222
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,100
- Comfortable clothes?
- Right.

2223
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,910
(Country vacation outfits
that are essential)

2224
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:07,370
What? There's a guitar too.

2225
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:10,540
(There are many things to play with
as well.)

2226
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,850
This is quite nice.

2227
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:14,410
The front yard is so...

2228
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,980
My gosh. This is nice.

2229
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,290
(The place is full of items
perfect for the country vacation.)

2230
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:19,990
There's a furnace.

2231
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:21,050
Right.

2232
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:22,890
What is all this?

2233
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,660
Hi.

2234
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,630
They even gave us this
so we could go fishing.

2235
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,230
Jong Min.

2236
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:29,500
I think we can fish here.

2237
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,000
I see. We have a map.

2238
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,770
- There's a reservoir.
- Yes.

2239
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:34,640
- Let's go fishing later.
- Okay. Let's go.

2240
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:37,670
This is really nice.

2241
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:38,970
Can we really rest now?

2242
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,310
(The country vacation is prepared
for the members who can't rest.)

2243
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:47,380
(Please don't worry and enjoy it.)

2244
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:52,720
(Blow away all the stress
from the city.)

2245
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,150
It's done.

2246
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:59,390
(You can focus solely on yourself.)

2247
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:03,660
(A time that is like rest)

2248
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,900
(Sweet)

2249
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,370
(Enjoy the beautiful sunset
of the West Sea.)

2250
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,270
(Have dinner full of the vibes
of a night market in the evening.)

2251
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:16,910
(Perfect)

2252
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:19,250
(Relaxing)

2253
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:27,420
(They will build special memories
here for 2 days and 1 night.)

2254
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:32,730
(Shall we enjoy
the country vacation together?)

2255
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:36,700
(Sae Ho unpacks his stuff first.)

2256
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:38,470
- Will you get changed?
- I should unpack.

2257
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:39,930
Yes, let's change
into something comfortable.

2258
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:41,970
What's that?

2259
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,640
(A quilted vest)

2260
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,040
I should hurry and pick a cute one.

2261
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,810
I like the rose one.

2262
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,410
(The perfect outfit
for a country vacation)

2263
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,880
- I think this is...
- Yes.

2264
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,010
I have a bad feeling about this.

2265
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,880
I think some of us will end up
getting dragged to somewhere else.

2266
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,850
I'm sure that will happen.

2267
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:01,090
This can't be the beautiful
country vacation we imagined.

2268
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:02,890
Stop babbling like that.

2269
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:04,090
Are you getting changed?

2270
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,730
- Why?
- Why do you keep grumbling?

2271
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,030
Look? These are comfortable clothes.

2272
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:08,430
Why do you think we're wearing them?

2273
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:09,860
They'll make us work.

2274
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:10,930
Am I right?

2275
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:12,330
You will send us somewhere else.

2276
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:13,330
You'll send us to an island...

2277
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,630
and tell us to survive on our own.

2278
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,840
No, this really is
Our Own Country Vacation.

2279
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,770
- But why the working clothes?
- Just have fun.

2280
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:21,210
You can just not work
in the working clothes.

2281
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:23,110
Come. Let's play Frisbee.

2282
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,380
In the working clothes,
we will play Freebies...

2283
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:26,810
- instead of working?
- Frisbee.

2284
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,320
It's Frisbee, not Freebies.

2285
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,080
Love always comes back!

2286
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,290
(Love is thrown to the ground.)

2287
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:35,360
You should do it like this.
It should go toward you.

2288
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,590
That's it.

2289
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,390
Nice.

2290
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,430
Good.

2291
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,230
I'll catch it with my mouth.

2292
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:45,470
Gosh, I can't do that. It's scary.

2293
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:47,170
(Scared)

2294
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:48,170
I can't do that.

2295
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:50,300
- How would dogs do that?
- You should be far away.

2296
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,510
This is what I imagined.

2297
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:53,270
(Joon can do it
only in his imagination.)

2298
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:55,280
(Meanwhile, Jong Min is...)

2299
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:57,980
(He lies down right away.)

2300
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,180
- Let's get some sleep.
- What?

2301
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,720
- Okay?
- Do you want to sleep?

2302
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,950
I should lie down. It's hot.

2303
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:07,250
This is so relaxing. Look.

2304
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,360
I know.

2305
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:11,890
(Glancing)

2306
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:15,700
(Sae Ho fans Jong Min
so he won't feel hot.)

2307
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:21,500
Se Yoon, it's cool in here.
You can find a pillow there.

2308
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,770
This is nice.

2309
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:26,910
(The members have all gathered.)

2310
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:28,510
- I'll go get it.
- It's cool, isn't it?

2311
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,810
This is peaceful and nice.

2312
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,280
This is really nice.
The weather is good too.

2313
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:36,220
This is a real country vacation.

2314
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,320
Right.

2315
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,790
(They put aside their doubts
and enjoy the vacation for now.)

2316
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,120
How nice.

2317
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,120
It's so peaceful.

2318
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,120
(They are now enjoying
the country vacation properly.)

2319
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:47,690
(Se Yoon suddenly shows up
with a cassette player.)

2320
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,660
I thought it was a wake-up song,
so I was surprised.

2321
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,500
- I was really surprised.
- All right.

2322
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,070
All right. From the right.

2323
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:55,070
(Dancing)

2324
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:56,600
- Kick the ball
- Soccer!

2325
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,240
Kick the ball

2326
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:00,710
- We are the champions
- I'm awake now.

2327
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:02,210
To the right. Cheerfully.

2328
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:04,410
All right. Kick the ball!

2329
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:06,410
(Excited Sae Ho joins him.)

2330
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,420
(The comedians are in sync.)

2331
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,520
I don't understand them.

2332
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,590
- What are you doing? Why?
- Two.

2333
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:17,320
- Why are you doing this?
- To the right.

2334
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:21,530
(Is this supposed
to be a country vacation?)

2335
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:23,730
What are you doing
in the middle of a nap?

2336
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,030
- Good, everyone.
- I must be out of my mind.

2337
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:27,070
I should sleep.

2338
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:28,240
- I can't help it.
- Clap over your heads.

2339
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,710
- Clap your hands.
- Clap.

2340
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:34,410
Shout as you run forward.

2341
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:35,940
(He failed hold back his excitement
and came out again.)

2342
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,710
Raise your hands.

2343
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:39,910
(Make some noise.)

2344
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:41,050
As you walk backward.

2345
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:43,180
(Let's enjoy it together.)

2346
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:44,520
- What are you doing?
- All right.

2347
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:45,820
(You can't resist this.
Red Warriors!)

2348
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:48,560
- Wave the Korean flag
- Wave the Korean flag

2349
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:51,530
- Show the world
- The spirit of Korea

2350
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:54,630
(The fan dance begins.)

2351
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:58,100
(Dopamine rush)

2352
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:01,540
(This is so exciting.)

2353
01:20:01,770 --> 01:20:04,700
(In a trance)

2354
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,180
(Fashion Muscle is
knocked down first.)

2355
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:10,380
All right. Row.

2356
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:14,150
(They enjoy it all together
without anyone left behind.)

2357
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:16,080
(Happy)

2358
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,380
Good.

2359
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:18,490
I'm sweating. Let's stop.

2360
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:19,590
Applaud.

2361
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:20,690
(Clapping)

2362
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:21,990
Let's sleep now.

2363
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:23,760
- We should sleep now.
- Let's rest.

2364
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,030
I'm wide awake now.

2365
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:32,230
(After having a lot of fun,)

2366
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:36,900
(the members are fast asleep.)

2367
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:41,410
(30 minutes later)

2368
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:48,380
(They don't seem to have
any intention of getting up.)

2369
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:53,320
Everyone.

2370
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,260
- What?
- Come on out for a moment.

2371
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:57,390
- What?
- Come on out.

2372
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:59,260
(Half-asleep)

2373
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:01,800
(Stretching)

2374
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:03,460
You guys had a good sleep.

2375
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,770
(A pose of someone
who had a good sleep)

2376
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,740
Jong Min said he wouldn't sleep
two hours ago.

2377
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:11,570
What? No. I was just thinking.

2378
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,240
It's just that we needed
some time to sleep.

2379
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,210
Come on out.

2380
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:20,510
(They come out as they are told.)

2381
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,880
We are here to eat.

2382
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,390
- Shall we have a seat?
- Yes, please sit together.

2383
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:26,520
Let's sit together.

2384
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,460
Are we getting food?

2385
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:32,530
Sae Ho and I couldn't sleep.

2386
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:34,900
We got excited and kept singing.

2387
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,500
Hey, are you here to sleep?

2388
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,430
Tidy up your hair
before saying that.

2389
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,400
Why would you say that
with such disheveled hair?

2390
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,770
I slept so well.

2391
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:45,210
Do you like the country vacation?

2392
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:46,640
- Of course.
- It's great.

2393
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:49,380
- Now...
- We should stop now.

2394
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,710
- Don't say that.
- Why are you saying "now?"

2395
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,250
- Let's just have fun.
- We should just enjoy it.

2396
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:57,050
Now, we will enjoy
the country vacation more properly.

2397
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:59,620
I asked this to Jong Min
the other day.

2398
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:02,760
"Is there anything you want to do
during the shoot?"

2399
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,220
- Don't ask him.
- I asked him.

2400
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:05,460
Does his opinion matter?

2401
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,190
Why do you always ask him?

2402
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:09,530
- What did I say?
- Do you remember what you said?

2403
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:10,560
No.

2404
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:12,370
Jong Min said,

2405
01:22:13,330 --> 01:22:14,670
"I don't want to do anything."

2406
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:15,700
(Jong Min said,
"I don't want to do anything.")

2407
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:17,770
- See?
- My brother.

2408
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,840
- My brother.
- Just listen to him.

2409
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,010
- Now...
- You should listen to him.

2410
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:23,110
Finally, he sounds like a senior.

2411
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:24,640
(He suddenly became a hero.)

2412
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:26,250
So we prepared this.

2413
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:27,680
This mission is...

2414
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,050
a spacing out competition.

2415
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:31,320
- I see.
- That sounds great.

2416
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,350
The person who literally spaces out
for the longest time...

2417
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:36,490
will be given ten dollars...

2418
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:38,360
that can be used freely.

2419
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,790
- My gosh.
- What can we do with ten dollars?

2420
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,760
(If you save up
the allowance you receive,)

2421
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:45,670
(you can go shopping
at the market...)

2422
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,170
(and buy delicious food.)

2423
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,340
(5 dollars and 10 dollars)

2424
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,470
Here are the criteria
for spacing out.

2425
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:54,140
If the look on your face changes...

2426
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:55,610
or if you move, you're out.

2427
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:58,210
If you doze off or talk,
you're out as well.

2428
01:22:58,210 --> 01:22:59,410
Are we not supposed to doze off?

2429
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:00,810
- That's right.
- That's hard.

2430
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:01,820
It's really hard.

2431
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:03,820
Where does it take place?

2432
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:05,920
You can start here right away.

2433
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:06,990
- Really?
- Yes.

2434
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:08,050
Then I should get ready
with a good posture.

2435
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:09,520
Can we keep a comfortable posture?

2436
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,120
Like this?

2437
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:13,860
I should be careful though.

2438
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,300
My arms are moving.

2439
01:23:15,330 --> 01:23:17,100
(Ready)

2440
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,400
All right. Are you ready?

2441
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:21,270
- Ready.
- Wait.

2442
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,140
(Twitching)

2443
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:25,940
Jong Min, we will catch
the twitch of your lips like that.

2444
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:27,540
Really?

2445
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:29,980
- Will you catch that too?
- Yes.

2446
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,880
- We will spot it.
- That's not good.

2447
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:32,880
All right.

2448
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:34,280
- Hang on.
- Okay.

2449
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,980
Let's just start it. Come on.

2450
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:39,120
- Ready.
- It's funny. I might laugh.

2451
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:41,120
Start.

2452
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:44,360
(The spacing out competition
begins.)

2453
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:52,530
(The spacing out competition is on.)

2454
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,820
(The contestants are
properly spacing out.)

2455
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:12,720
(It's a groundbreaking mission
without any sound.)

2456
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:14,720
(Laughing)

2457
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,790
(I must hold out.)

2458
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:22,000
(The spacing out competition is on.)

2459
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
(Snorting)

2460
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:29,570
(Se Yoon fails to hold back
his laughter and is eliminated.)

2461
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:30,640
Se Yoon is out.

2462
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,040
(He failed to get ten dollars.)

2463
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:35,840
(Facing a crisis)

2464
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:37,740
This is all about
holding back laughter.

2465
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:44,550
(Laughter alert)

2466
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:45,550
Jong Min.

2467
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:48,250
Why are you...

2468
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,760
(Jong Min is out.)

2469
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,020
Come on.

2470
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:54,030
(Smiling)

2471
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,530
(Seon Ho is out too.)

2472
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:57,900
Is Seon Ho out?

2473
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,030
(Three of them are eliminated
in a row.)

2474
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:01,200
- Hang on.
- Seriously...

2475
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,470
- You shouldn't make me laugh.
- This is so fun.

2476
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,170
(He starts disturbing them.)

2477
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:07,740
Are you out?

2478
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:10,480
(Twitching)

2479
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:11,880
That was funny.

2480
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,880
(He doesn't move.)

2481
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:13,980
Come on.

2482
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:16,880
Take off his socks.

2483
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:18,490
(Sabotage mode on)

2484
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:19,690
Take off his socks.

2485
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:21,960
Three of you are left.

2486
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,960
(Resolute)

2487
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:30,330
(The survivors are tough.)

2488
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,730
(Just then)

2489
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:38,540
One person can do the bungee jump.

2490
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:40,270
A bungee jump? What?

2491
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:41,810
- The bungee jump?
- Yes.

2492
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:43,310
They want us over there now.

2493
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,840
The bungee jump?

2494
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,710
(Judging the situation)

2495
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:47,710
What should we do?

2496
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:51,020
One person to bungee.
How high is the jump?

2497
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:52,250
- It's 50m.
- It's 50m?

2498
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,250
(I must bungee jump if I lose?)

2499
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:56,760
(This was Joon last summer.)

2500
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,160
Gosh, hang on. Goodness.

2501
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:03,400
(Joon forfeited the bungee.)

2502
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,670
- What should we do?
- A bungee jump?

2503
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,400
Are we going bungee jumping?

2504
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,700
- We're going bungee jumping?
- One person to bungee.

2505
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:15,070
(The other survivors
are flustered too.)

2506
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:16,140
What's going on?

2507
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:18,210
- I'll have them set it up.
- Okay.

2508
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:19,810
Sae Ho, are you all right?

2509
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:23,020
(Giggling)

2510
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:26,020
(They couldn't hold it in.)

2511
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,590
What's this about bungee jumping?

2512
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:31,960
(FYI, everything
that comes up now is a lie.)

2513
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:34,730
Sae Ho would rather skip
the bridge of a song.

2514
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:35,960
(The bungee didn't phase them.)

2515
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:39,070
He looks so ugly right now.

2516
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:41,330
Surprisingly, he's...

2517
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:43,900
quite camouflaged against that wall.

2518
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,940
I thought he was the wall.

2519
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:47,110
(Sae Ho's strong!)

2520
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:49,180
Shall we discuss the next trip?

2521
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,740
- Go ahead.
- Since we have the time.

2522
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,480
- The theme of the episode.
- Yes.

2523
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:55,780
We're thinking of doing
a real summer training show.

2524
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:57,650
- "Real summer?"
- Yes.

2525
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,750
We haven't been to a mountain
in a while.

2526
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:01,150
A mountain...

2527
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:02,790
- Which mountain?
- Also...

2528
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:04,760
- Mount Jiri's nice.
- Mount Jiri.

2529
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,090
Someone mentioned Mount Seorak.

2530
01:27:06,990 --> 01:27:08,230
DinDin won't like that.

2531
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:09,930
DinDin, well...

2532
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,200
If he doesn't object too much.

2533
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,600
- He won't talk.
- Then it'll be fine.

2534
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:18,270
His nickname is Sanmai
because he hikes a lot.

2535
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:20,040
- "Sanmai?"
- Are you Sanmai?

2536
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,270
He hikes a lot.

2537
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:24,010
His nickname is Sanmai
because he hikes a lot.

2538
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:28,550
(Sanmai)

2539
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:29,780
Mountains...

2540
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,420
(DinDin is out.)

2541
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:35,420
- You're Sanmai because you hike.
- Are you serious?

2542
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,490
What on earth is "Sanmai?"

2543
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:38,990
(Meanwhile, behind them...)

2544
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:41,160
"I want to climb mountains.
I'm Sanmai."

2545
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:45,370
(The production crew's hidden card
lies in wait.)

2546
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:49,800
Sae Ho and Joon are still competing.

2547
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,040
It's a close match.

2548
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:54,210
Then the rest of us.

2549
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:56,080
Since we're out,
can we go to the food truck...

2550
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,140
and eat some fried fish
or something?

2551
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,080
Only then, 1 of the 2 will move.

2552
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:02,020
We'll take it out of a pocket...
What's going on?

2553
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:06,850
(Who is the hidden card?)

2554
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:09,420
We had a plan.

2555
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:11,620
It's ruined.

2556
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:12,860
What are you on about?

2557
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:14,790
(Lee Byung Jin,
field team, final boss)

2558
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,730
- What are you on about?
- Originally...

2559
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:18,060
- What's that?
- Painted nails?

2560
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:19,830
- You had your nails done?
- This is what happened.

2561
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:21,570
The original plan
was to take a call...

2562
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:22,670
The call's coming in now.

2563
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:23,800
What are you doing?

2564
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,370
He's not drunk, is he?

2565
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:26,910
I was to take a call like this...

2566
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:28,640
and show off my painted nails.

2567
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,380
- Then I was to show my feet.
- Okay.

2568
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:34,310
I was about to come in,
but I had no service.

2569
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:35,380
- Your phone?
- I see.

2570
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:37,680
This is like watching
a US comedy show.

2571
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:41,420
(Welcome to the Byung Jin Show.)

2572
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:43,590
Yes, hello?

2573
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,530
Yes, I'm sitting down.

2574
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,030
Number two of the monthly design,
the teddy bears.

2575
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,130
Can I get them on my toenails too?

2576
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,040
(Acting with his feet)

2577
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,040
What's this?

2578
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:00,140
Number two of the monthly design,
the teddy bears.

2579
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:03,580
Can I get them on my toenails too?

2580
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:05,480
(About to cry)

2581
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,850
I need the gel removed.

2582
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:09,580
- Cho Sae Ho's out.
- How much for that?

2583
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:10,950
Cho Sae Ho...

2584
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,350
- Okay, I'll be there tomorrow.
- Joon's laughing too.

2585
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:16,560
(This is cheating.)

2586
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:18,990
What are you doing in front of me?

2587
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:21,160
I could see his feet...

2588
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,800
so clearly from this angle.

2589
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,560
- Gosh.
- Well done.

2590
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:26,870
- That was insane.
- Byung Jin.

2591
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:28,100
(He rips up the stage and leaves.)

2592
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:30,640
We... We can't beat Byung Jin.

2593
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:33,640
His phone scene
was like a US comedy sketch.

2594
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:35,240
"It's ruined."

2595
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:37,710
"I was supposed to get a call.
It's ruined."

2596
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:38,950
"It's still a go? Okay."

2597
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,780
Just so you know, Byung Jin...

2598
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:45,420
didn't do a single thing we asked.

2599
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:49,160
What was that about no coverage?

2600
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,320
He was supposed to walk in
talking on the phone.

2601
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,330
There was no signal?

2602
01:29:52,330 --> 01:29:54,430
"My phone didn't ring,
and I was flustered."

2603
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:55,600
I think that's what he meant.

2604
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,900
- That was crazy.
- The spacing out competition...

2605
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,130
ended in Joon's victory.

2606
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:03,170
- You get ten dollars.
- Congratulations.

2607
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,370
- I did well too.
- You lasted a long time.

2608
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:06,410
It was close.

2609
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:08,340
You can pay for your lunch...

2610
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:10,680
with the allowance you have.

2611
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:12,310
The jjamppong across from us...

2612
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:14,850
is a really good place
that the locals vouch for.

2613
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:17,520
(Under ten dollars: Jjajangmyeon,
large jjajangmyeon,)

2614
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,150
(samseon jjajangmyeon,
seafood tray jjajangmyeon,)

2615
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:20,620
(brisket jjamppong,
seafood jjamppong...)

2616
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,620
- I'm jealous of Joon.
- Let's share a jjajangmyeon.

2617
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,420
- Let's share.
- We can split a large.

2618
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:25,890
- Yes.
- Let's go.

2619
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:28,090
Let's get over there
and smell the place first.

2620
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:30,000
We'll get picked radish at least.

2621
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:31,800
Byung Jin was hilarious.

2622
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,000
He was so funny.

2623
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:35,700
I've never been in
a spacing out competition.

2624
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:36,740
It was about trying not to laugh.

2625
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,940
(Next episode)

2626
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:43,310
(A peaceful country vacation)

2627
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:49,950
(With no forewarning...)

2628
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:52,550
(comes bloodshed)

2629
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:54,690
(Darn you)

2630
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,560
(The secret
about the country vacation)

2631
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:59,390
(Preparing dinner)

2632
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:01,330
(Cleaning up)

2633
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,260
(Preparing to go to sleep)

2634
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,230
(Self-sufficient real wild variety)

2635
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:09,670
(Do we have to do that too?)

2636
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,310
(Select the worst worker.)

2637
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:18,210
(If you want free time,)

2638
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:21,350
(do your best.)

2639
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:23,980
(Who will suffer
the country vacation nightmare?)

2640
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:25,890
Come on. Let's share.

2641
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:27,250
Sorry.
