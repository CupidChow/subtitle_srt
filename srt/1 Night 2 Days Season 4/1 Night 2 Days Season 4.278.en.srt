1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,110
I feel hungry now.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,710
Let's go.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,710
Joon can order one jjajangmyeon...

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,750
and four bowls of rice,
and we can take the extra sauce.

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,850
- That's how it works?
- That's perfect.

6
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,850
(Laughing)

7
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,950
(He just laughs.)

8
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,020
Our dear Joon.

9
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,220
- One is one
- One is one

10
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,160
- It's not two
- It's not two

11
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,560
(Everyone but Joon is in agreement.)

12
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,190
(Looking carefully)

13
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,730
Those flowers are really pretty.

14
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,160
What flower is this?

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,370
- A pretty flower.
- They're pretty.

16
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,070
(Flanders poppy flowers
brighten the quiet roadside.)

17
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,540
This is what I like
about the countryside. Its nature.

18
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,440
(Brisket Jjamppong)

19
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,040
- This is it.
- It's brisket jjamppong.

20
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,340
- Gosh.
- What's this?

21
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,540
- My word.
- It's insane.

22
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,110
There's brisket.

23
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,450
Brisket jjamppong?

24
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,880
Brisket jjamppong. That's crazy.

25
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,580
You're the best of all jjamppong

26
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,590
Places like this
don't scrimp on ingredients.

27
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,250
The best of all jjamppong

28
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,520
They don't scrimp.

29
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,090
The jjamppong must be really good...

30
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,220
- because...
- I'll sit here.

31
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,530
it costs ten dollars...

32
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,230
while the tangsuyuk
costs 13 dollars.

33
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,000
- That's the small serving.
- Yes.

34
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,130
That's impossible.

35
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,630
Joon could order a bowl for himself.

36
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,740
(Only Joon will have a full belly.)

37
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,200
Right now,
you have just ten dollars.

38
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,240
- Joon.
- Yes.

39
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,070
Don't be too discouraged.

40
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

41
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,640
We came to a famous restaurant,

42
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,350
- so you deserve a taste.
- That's right.

43
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,680
- We should taste it.
- Yes.

44
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
That's right.

45
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,750
This mission is...

46
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,150
Guess the Song.

47
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,750
- What?
- "Guess the Song?"

48
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,990
What's the title?

49
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,860
Who sang the song?

50
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,690
Is that it? Okay.

51
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,330
"Guess the Song?"

52
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,830
We'll play a song backward.

53
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,870
- Name the song and singer.
- We can't do that.

54
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,240
We'll give you
2.5 dollars per correct answer.

55
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,100
- Do you have like ten songs?
- Yes.

56
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,340
Do we fend for ourselves?

57
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,570
- You're in it alone.
- I see.

58
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,380
If you get two right,
you can only afford makgeolli.

59
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,610
You can have jjajangmyeon too.

60
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,280
Just so you know, the team...

61
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,490
that test-tasted the food here...

62
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,550
"Test-tasted."

63
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,360
- "Test-tasted."
- "Test-tasted."

64
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,090
You test-tasted the food.

65
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,190
Good for you.

66
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,190
(He mastered mocking Jong Min.)

67
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,760
(Now he's mocking the director.)

68
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,030
You're an expert at mocking others.

69
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,730
I am. That short nap...

70
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,030
maximized my energy!

71
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,600
(They're hyped because of
their relatively relaxed schedule.)

72
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,740
- "Guess the Song."
- This is fun.

73
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,170
- All right.
- If I were you, I'd drop him.

74
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,270
Seriously. I really would.

75
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,370
(Drop him from the show, Jong Hyun.)

76
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,810
Why are you putting up
with this kind of treatment?

77
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,550
Hey. It's like...

78
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,910
No!

79
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,950
Don't drop me.

80
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,450
(I don't want to drop out
of the show.)

81
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,590
- Gosh, he's no joke.
- Well...

82
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,260
(Director Joo,
leave Se Yoon's body.)

83
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,890
A while ago, Se Yoon sang...

84
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,360
- Yes.
- IU's song backward.

85
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
- He made it entertaining.
- Yes.

86
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,860
- Which song was it?
- It was "Marshmallow."

87
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,860
How did you sing it?

88
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,870
(Mallow marsh)

89
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,900
Is that how it will go?

90
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,200
(The marshmallow might melt
from the pressure.)

91
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Mallow marsh

92
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,140
(Getting a reality check)

93
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,540
- He's full of energy today
- It love I

94
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,710
(He finishes it
with the perfect ending.)

95
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,250
- Do you want to do a practice run?
- My gosh. "Mallow marsh."

96
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,350
Here's a practice round.

97
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,350
This is a practice round.
Quiet down.

98
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,220
We have songs
from the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s,

99
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,890
and 2020s.

100
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,890
- That's neat.
- Okay.

101
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,690
Whoever wins the practice round...

102
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,760
- will get to choose the era.
- From that era?

103
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,800
- Okay.
- From the 1990s?

104
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,500
How about a dollar for this round?
To get us in good spirits.

105
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,500
- Yes.
- It will keep us in good spirits.

106
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,100
- Yes. We can't use it anyway.
- Yes, you should.

107
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,270
We can't order any food with that.

108
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,410
- We'll give you two dollars.
- Okay.

109
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,710
- Gosh, two dollars.
- Oh, my.

110
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,910
Then Joon will probably know better
and not participate.

111
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,210
- Right. Don't play.
- I'll donate it.

112
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,610
- You can go for it.
- Yes.

113
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,610
- Yes.
- All right.

114
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,250
Play the song.

115
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,680
(The practice round starts.)

116
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,350
(The song sounds a bit strange.)

117
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,850
- I...
- I got it.

118
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,090
- DinDin.
- "Lucifer."

119
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,560
- That's it.
- Whose song is it?

120
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
- I got it.
- SHINee.
That's correct.

121
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,060
Correct.

122
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,660
- Okay.
- That was amazing.

123
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,530
(They were listening to the song
in reverse from the end.)

124
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,000
(What if the song was played
the right way?)

125
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,640
(It's the song we recognize.)

126
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,740
(As DinDin won the practice round,)

127
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,610
(he will pick the era
for the next song.)

128
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,780
- Hey, but...
- I picked up on the synthesizer.

129
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,250
- You recognized the synthesizer.
- Gosh.

130
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,950
- I picked up on that.
- He's a musician, indeed.

131
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,990
Okay. I won two dollars.

132
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,090
- Yes, two dollars.
- That was amazing.

133
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,520
- Okay.
- Gosh, if I win one more dollar,

134
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,560
I can buy makgeolli.

135
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,460
By the way,
it didn't sound completely off.

136
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,090
- It had a similar vibe.
- Yes, it did.

137
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,460
- The melody sounded similar.
- Yes. I got the vibe.

138
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,700
- I just didn't know this song.
- I...

139
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,730
- I can follow my gut.
- All right.

140
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,570
- Which era?
- DinDin, which era will you pick?

141
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,100
- You have 2 dollars now?
- Pick the 2000s.

142
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,570
- I'll pick 2020s.
- You'll pick 2020s?

143
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,740
The 2020s.

144
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,440
- I don't know songs from this era.
- I guess this is my break.

145
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,940
I don't think
I can recognize them in reverse.

146
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,340
All right. Play the song.

147
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,640
(Here's the first question.)

148
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,780
(He doesn't know the song,
but he's getting excited.)

149
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,090
- I got it.
- DinDin.

150
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,490
What song is it?

151
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,620
- I have no idea.
- I have no idea.

152
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,360
- I have no idea.
- I doubt I even know this song.

153
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,860
Three, two,

154
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,490
- I won't say it.
- one.

155
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,800
- I won't say it.
- Out of time.

156
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,900
- Let's keep listening to it.
- We'll keep playing it.

157
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
(Humming)
- I got it.
- I got it.

158
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Darn it.

159
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,470
"Dynamite" by BTS.

160
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,840
- Gosh, that's not it.
- That's it.

161
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,270
- Really? That's...
- Correct.

162
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,010
Yes. I wasn't sure...

163
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,680
(As the lyrics are the same
forward and backward,)

164
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,350
(he figured out the title
right away from this part.)

165
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,490
Yes. I wasn't sure whether or not
this was "Butter" or "Dynamite."

166
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,820
(I got confused with "Butter.")

167
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,090
Gosh,
that was "Dynamite" in reverse?

168
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,690
- Look at him swaying his hips.
- Wasn't that too fast?

169
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,790
Look at his hips.

170
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,000
(His movements are robust
given his medical condition.)

171
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,460
It's the lymph node dance.

172
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
It's the lymph node dance.

173
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,770
- My gosh.
- Check out his lymph node dance.

174
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,400
- There it is.
- Ta-da.

175
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,770
- Great. "Dynamite."
- My gosh.

176
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,040
I won 2.5 dollars. Let's go.

177
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,640
- I can pick the era I want.
- Gosh, I knew it.

178
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,650
Yes.

179
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,480
- Gosh.
- Gosh, I knew it.

180
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,550
- I could've gotten this right.
- Yes.

181
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,980
The era I want is the 1990s.

182
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
- Okay.
- Okay.

183
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,220
- The 1990s.
- Okay. Let's go.

184
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,420
I have to get this right for sure.

185
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,420
(This is the perfect era
for the older members)

186
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,920
- Gosh, this is hard.
- This is it for me.

187
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,090
- It's the 1990s.
- This is fun.

188
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,990
- Ballad songs will be harder.
- All right.

189
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,030
- Right?
- Yes.

190
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,690
Play the song.

191
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,360
(The second question)

192
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,570
(Flinching)

193
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,100
- I got it.
- Se Yoon.

194
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,440
- He recognized the song?
- I got it.

195
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Clon's song.

196
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
- I got it.
- Two...
"First Love."

197
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,810
("First Love" by Clon)

198
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,880
- Wrong.
- He's fixated on Clon.

199
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,180
- No. I'll keep listening to it.
- Wrong.

200
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
What?

201
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,680
- I got it.
- Joon.

202
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,720
- What?
- "Pure Love" by KOYOTE.

203
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,850
Wrong.
- I got it.
- Seon Ho.

204
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,020
"Change" by Lee Jung Hyun.

205
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,260
- Wrong.
- "Change" by Lee Jung Hyun.

206
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,990
- Wrong.
- I got it.

207
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,060
- I got it.
- I got it.

208
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,190
- Sae Ho.
- "Come" by Lee Jung Hyun.

209
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
That's the one.

210
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,730
("Come" by Lee Jung Hyun)

211
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,700
(That's the one.)

212
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,830
- That's it.
- Correct.

213
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,940
(A timid way
of expressing his anger)

214
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,670
- So...
- Hold on. Mister.

215
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,040
- Mister.
- You know what?

216
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,340
- You gave a hint with your face.
- Mister!

217
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,240
"Lee Jung Hyun's..." What was that?

218
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,310
"Change." "Oh, no."

219
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,550
(Director Joo gave a hint
with his facial expression?)

220
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,120
(When Seon Ho's answer was close
to the correct answer,)

221
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,490
(he failed to control
his facial expression.)

222
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,850
(He practically gave away
the answer.)

223
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,160
Are you seriously going to do that?

224
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
(He doesn't care.)

225
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,130
Why did you do that, seriously?

226
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,330
- What was that?
- Mister.

227
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,330
That was so obvious.

228
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,730
- You gave away the answer.
- We just had to read his face.

229
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,230
This game is
about reading your face then.

230
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,270
This game becomes...

231
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,670
- Read Jong Hyun's Face.
- I knew the answer.

232
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,870
(He has no excuse to offer.)

233
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,540
- My gosh. I'll be careful.
- This is...

234
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,440
- Gosh, I was close.
- You know what?

235
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,770
I have enough money
for jjajangmyeon.

236
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,810
- All right.
- That's amazing.

237
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,440
Let me pick the era again.
I'll pick the 2000s.

238
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,110
- You picked the 2000s.
- Okay, the 2000s.

239
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,450
- That's good.
- I'll play a song from the 2000s.

240
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,650
My lips are getting dry now.

241
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,520
- I hope it's from 2001.
- Gosh.

242
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,980
Play the song.

243
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,290
(Here's the third question.)

244
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,890
(What song is this?)

245
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
(This isn't on pause.)

246
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,460
- I got it.
- I got it.

247
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,960
- I got it.
- Sae Ho.

248
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,030
- It's Fin.K.L's song.
- Gosh.

249
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,400
- I got it.
- I got it.

250
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
(He can't remember the title.)

251
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,170
- I got it.
- I got it.

252
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,770
- Three, two, one.
- I got it.

253
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,100
(The runaway engine has returned.)

254
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,540
- I got it.
- I got it.

255
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,210
- Get out of my way.
- I got it.

256
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,440
(Taking over Seon Ho's camera)

257
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
(As he was born in 2002,
he has no idea.)

258
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,510
- I was faster.
- Jong Min said it first.

259
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,580
(Jong Min gets to answer it.)

260
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,680
- I...
- You answer it quickly then.

261
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,980
- This is the only thing I can get.
- He's buying time to think.

262
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,050
- I got it.
- What's the correct answer?

263
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,290
"Now."

264
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,290
- Whose song is it?
- Whose song is it?

265
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,750
- Fin.K.L's song.
- I guess he's wrong.

266
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,360
- Correct.
- It was "Now."

267
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,660
(Disappointed)

268
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,060
One, two, three, four.

269
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,400
My gosh.

270
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
(Bumping)

271
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,670
Stop the song.

272
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,300
My gosh. Great.

273
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,870
Stop the song.
Are you okay, Jong Min?

274
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,540
- Are you okay?
- Stop the song.

275
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,040
- Hey, it's made of steel.
- Where?

276
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,350
- I'm serious, though.
- Hey, it's made of steel.

277
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,480
There was a loud thud.

278
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,350
- Jong Min, you won 2.5 dollars.
- Just like how I imagined

279
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,820
Which era will you pick?

280
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,290
- I'll pick the 1990s.
- The 1990s.

281
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,190
- We can only pick those two.
- He went back.

282
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,030
- Right. The 1990s and 2000s.
- We must answer as many as we can.

283
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,060
All right. Play the song.

284
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,630
(Here's the fourth question.)

285
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:54,440
(Viewers,
try guessing the song with them.)

286
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,440
(What's the correct answer?)

287
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,640
- I got it.
- Joon.

288
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,050
- Three, two,
- It's Baby V.O.X's song.

289
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,050
- one.
- "Get Up."

290
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,280
- I got it.
- Gosh, that's correct.

291
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,190
- Correct.
- That's it.

292
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,590
- He got that right?
- "Get Up."

293
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,820
Gosh, I was going to answer that.

294
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,520
Let's go, Kan Mi Youn.

295
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,460
- Tell me
- Kan Mi Youn.

296
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,730
(Things are getting heated now.)

297
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,360
(Their reaction differs
based on their age groups.)

298
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,100
(They're not excited
as they don't know the song.)

299
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,200
Get up

300
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,500
What did you say? "Giddy up?"

301
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
(Giddy up?)

302
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,340
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

303
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,610
- I can't seem to recognize any.
- Paparazzi

304
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,580
Gosh, how did he figure it out?

305
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,640
(He'll pick recent eras now.)

306
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,810
- What's the era you want, Joon?
- It's the 2000s.

307
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,810
- Okay.
- The 2000s.

308
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,320
Wouldn't the 2010s
be better for you?

309
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,650
- You performed as a singer then.
- No.

310
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,550
- He still listened to songs.
- I want the 2000s.

311
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,720
(It looks like we won't be able
to answer it again.)

312
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,020
Se Yoon and Seon Ho are...

313
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,060
the only ones who haven't gotten
any correct answer.

314
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,560
Play...

315
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,690
- I'm clueless.
- the next song.

316
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,130
(What is it?
I think I might know this one.)

317
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,170
I got it.

318
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
- I got it.
- Sae Ho.
"Pyo Pyo" by UP.

319
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
- Wrong.
- That's not it.
- That's totally wrong.
- I got it.

320
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,010
- Joon.
- "Give to You" by Lee Jung Hyun.

321
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,410
Wrong.

322
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,010
- Wrong.
- I got it.

323
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,110
- Sae Ho.
- "Mallow Marsh." "Marshmallow."

324
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,480
("Marshmallow")

325
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,680
- Whose song is it?
- IU.

326
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,610
Correct.

327
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,120
Mallow marsh

328
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,890
("Marshmallow" sounds
like a traditional folk song.)

329
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,630
(Unlike the melody,
his dance moves are cute.)

330
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,260
(That's cute.)

331
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,630
(Se Yoon puts on a concert
at a Chinese restaurant.)

332
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,170
(Laughing)

333
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,300
- Mallow marsh
- That was crazy.

334
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,240
- How did he get that?
- Mallow marsh

335
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,440
- He helped me.
- You just guessed it, right?

336
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,680
- Singing it earlier...
- That was crazy.

337
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,840
because of DinDin helped me.

338
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,140
(Sae Ho got him to sing it.)

339
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,780
- He must feel great.
- It's a dopamine rush.

340
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,610
- Do you have 2.5 dollars now?
- Yes, I do.

341
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,620
I'm doomed.

342
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,680
(Seon Ho is ranked last.)

343
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,420
All right. Pick the era.

344
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,450
- Okay.
- Let's go with the 2000s.

345
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,450
- Okay. The 2000s.
- The 2000s.

346
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,790
- My gosh.
- I must secure jjajangmyeon.

347
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,020
I must at least secure that.

348
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,190
You need to get things going
for you. Get one song first.

349
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,060
- Yes. I must go over to the 2020s.
- Yes.

350
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,060
You must.

351
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,760
Even Seon Ho might know this song...

352
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,030
- from the 2000s.
- Okay.

353
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,170
All right. Play the song.

354
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,170
(Here's the sixth question.)

355
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,870
- I got it.
- I got it.

356
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,910
- Seon Ho.
- I got it.

357
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,910
(Seon Ho finally goes for it.)

358
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,980
"Sweet Little Kitty"
by Cherry Filter.

359
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,640
That's not it.
"Travel to Me" by Buzz.

360
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,650
- That's the one.
- That's it.

361
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,680
Correct.

362
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,280
- How did you get that?
- My gosh.

363
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,880
You have to put on a performance
with the song.

364
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,290
- Far away
- Use your front teeth.

365
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,520
- Use your front teeth.
- You're my sunshine

366
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,520
(Min Kyung Hoon can sing
with his head voice.)

367
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,090
(I can sing with my teeth.)

368
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,060
- Go for it.
- He's playing it with his teeth.

369
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,370
He's playing the guitar
with his front teeth.

370
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,370
(2 Days and 1 Night Band
has been formed.)

371
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,100
One, two. One, two, three, four.

372
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,270
This is it.

373
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,300
(Satisfied)

374
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,840
This is great. I've got 4.5 dollars.

375
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,880
(The band will be back someday.)

376
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,940
- Tell him the era.
- Yes.

377
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,510
- It's the 2010s.
- The 2010s.

378
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,680
My gosh, it's the 2010s.

379
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,080
- That's not a bad era.
- Yes.

380
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,580
Play...

381
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,580
(Here's the seventh question.)
the song.

382
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,360
This is from the 2010s?

383
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,360
(Is it a ballad song?)

384
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,500
What? It's an English song!

385
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,100
- I got it.
- I got it.

386
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,640
- I got it.
- I got it.

387
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,040
(Sae Ho beats Seon Ho
by a very close call.)

388
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,670
"Red Flavor" by Red Velvet.

389
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,940
- Right.
- I'm curious, honey

390
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,980
- That's it?
- I bet Sae Ho...

391
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,010
- lied about his medical condition.
- Correct.

392
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,910
- Okay.
- He's so good at dancing.

393
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,710
Do the dance by Red Velvet.

394
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,950
(If it means
he can get jjamppong...)

395
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,320
Could you move to the side?

396
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,520
He's putting on a performance.

397
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,820
What's he doing?

398
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,490
- I should've gone for it sooner.
- It goes like this.

399
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,720
How does the song start?

400
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,020
- I knew this one.
- Red flavor

401
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,230
- Red flavor
- How does it start?

402
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,760
- I had a feeling. Seriously.
- I'm curious, honey

403
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,230
(My favorite thing)

404
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,100
(In the world is red)

405
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,100
All right.

406
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,800
Really?

407
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,070
- No?
- You should say, "Brick Flavor."

408
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,900
(He plays along.)

409
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,910
All right.

410
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,270
(It's dry, honey)

411
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,270
(Laughing)

412
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,280
(Feeling proud)

413
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,880
- Which era would you like?
- Oh, the era? The era...

414
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,620
- Can you pick the 2020s?
- I'll pick this for Seon Ho.

415
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,850
I'll pick the 2010s for Seon Ho.

416
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,950
- I'll go with that again.
- Thank you.

417
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,120
- Okay.
- Or do you want the 2020s?

418
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,950
- The 2020s then.
- I'll go with the 2020s.

419
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,120
- The 2020s?
- Yes, the 2020s.

420
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,460
- For Seon Ho.
- My gosh.

421
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,590
Jong Min and I will have to
take a break.

422
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,590
- This...
- I'm sure you all know this song.

423
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
- Okay.
- All right.

424
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,600
Play the song.

425
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,400
(Please let me get this one.)

426
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
I got it.

427
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,270
- Gosh, he knows.
- He got it.

428
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,440
- DinDin.
- ZICO's song.

429
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,040
"Any Song."

430
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,540
("Any Song" by ZICO)

431
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,580
Correct.

432
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,380
("Any Song" by ZICO)

433
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,320
(Playing the piano with his teeth)

434
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,520
(Why do you guys look so down?)

435
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,990
(What's the problem? Say something)

436
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,690
(I know this song too.)

437
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,690
How did you figure it out?

438
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,430
- It's "Any Tooth" by DinDin.
- Yes.

439
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,570
DinDin can order jjajangmyeon too.

440
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,830
I can order jjajangmyeon.

441
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,970
- I'm envious.
- The road to jjamppong...

442
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,070
is quite far.

443
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,400
- Seon Ho.
- Yes?

444
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,610
- I'll go with the 2020s again.
- Thank you.

445
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,740
It's the 2020s.

446
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,640
How about doubling the money
for the last two questions?

447
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Doubling the money.

448
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,210
What do you think
doubling the money?

449
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,980
- Director Joo, we can hear it.
- Really?

450
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,050
We can double it, right?

451
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,780
It means we'll get twice the money.

452
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,290
If you get this one right,
we'll double the money.

453
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,650
- Okay.
- So we can earn five dollars?

454
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,090
- All right, the 2020s.
- The 2020s.

455
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,060
I'm sorry.
We ran out of songs from the 2020s.

456
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
- Let's go with the 2010s.
- Gosh.

457
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,500
The 2010s? Okay.
I'll play a song from the 2010s.

458
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,860
- Please.
- Please.

459
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,300
- Let me just get one right.
- I can double the money.

460
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,600
- This one...
- Let me get jjajangmyeon.

461
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,140
- Play...
- Please let it be a song I know.

462
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,470
the song.

463
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,480
(Viewers, did you figure it out?)

464
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:41,050
(Viewers,
try guessing the song with them.)

465
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,760
- I got it.
- Seon Ho.

466
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,230
"I Am the Best" by 2NE1.

467
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,990
- I think that's it.
- Correct.

468
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,800
("I Am the Best" by 2NE1)

469
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,570
(Seon Ho wins the doubled reward.)

470
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,030
- Gosh, how did you know that?
- That was good.

471
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,970
- Gosh, I did it.
- Seon Ho did a good job with it.

472
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,500
(Feeling proud)

473
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,970
(The brightest smile)

474
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,080
- I did it.
- Better than you!

475
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,280
- I'm the best
- I'm the best

476
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,980
Let me go over the amounts
of money you have now.

477
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,780
Jong Min, you have 2.5 dollars.

478
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,780
- Gosh.
- Se Yoon.

479
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,790
- Do I have 2.5 dollars?
- I can only order rice.

480
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,820
You have 2.5 dollars.

481
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,950
- That's...
- Sae Ho.

482
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,690
- You have 7.5 dollars.
- Okay.

483
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,120
- I have 7.5 dollars.
- Let's pool our money together.

484
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,130
- Gosh.
- Joon.

485
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,290
Excluding the 10 dollars,
you earned 2.5 dollars.

486
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,830
- DinDin, you have 7 dollars.
- Can you give me 2.5 dollars?

487
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,700
- Seon Ho, you have five dollars.
- Gosh.

488
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,370
- With just one question.
- Gosh.

489
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,870
I only got one question right.

490
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,500
But why do I feel like
I got many questions right?

491
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,570
- Because you're having fun.
- Because I'm having fun?

492
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,670
(That's odd.)

493
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,310
It feels like I answered them all.

494
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,780
- All right.
- Sorry. I'll go with the 2010s.

495
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,110
- The 2010s?
- Yes. Sorry.

496
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,950
- Okay.
- I need to have jjamppong.

497
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,950
Okay.

498
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,120
Play...

499
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,550
(Here's the last question.)

500
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,620
the song.

501
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,360
- What?
- I got it.

502
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,690
- DinDin.
- It said something about the feet.

503
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,230
Three, two,

504
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,590
- It said something about the feet.
- one.

505
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,160
Out of time!

506
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
(He runs out of time.)

507
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,840
- I got it.
- I got it.

508
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,910
- I got it.
- Hold on.

509
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,010
I was first. I got it.

510
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,240
- "Growl" by EXO.
- That's it.

511
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,580
- I couldn't remember the title.
- That's correct.

512
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,680
("Growl" by EXO)

513
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
That's it.

514
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,250
- I couldn't remember the title.
- That's correct.

515
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,690
(Is he trying to provoke them?)

516
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,860
Sae Ho...

517
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,190
(Laughing)

518
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,190
Sae Ho is so hyper.

519
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,030
His lymph nodes are swelling

520
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,830
(I'll play along, my friend.)

521
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,340
- Inflammation is building up
- Building up

522
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,770
Gosh, I knew it.

523
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,370
- All right, everyone.
- His lymph nodes are swelling

524
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,670
Let me go over the final results.

525
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,740
- It's ten dollars?
- Gosh.

526
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,780
(Joon: 12.5 dollars,
Seon Ho: 5 dollars,)

527
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,780
(Sae Ho: 12. 5 dollars,
Jong Min: 2.5 dollars,)

528
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,410
(DinDin: 7 dollars,
Se Yoon: 2.5 dollars)

529
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,110
If we combine all of our money,
we have a lot.

530
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,650
- If we pool all of our money...
- How much do we have then?

531
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,620
- Let's add up our money.
- If we do... I have 12.5 dollars.

532
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,220
- I have...
- Joon has 12.5 dollars.

533
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,450
That's 25 dollars.

534
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,360
- We have 42 dollars.
- We have 42 dollars.

535
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,490
- Forty-two dollars? Gosh.
- Forty-two dollars.

536
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,790
Let's order tangsuyuk...

537
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,960
We can increase the size.

538
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,730
We can double our noodles.

539
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,100
Hold on.

540
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,400
How much do we have
if only the rich pooled the money?

541
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
(Oh, no.
He's trying to outsmart us again.)

542
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,040
How much do you have? Seven dollars?

543
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,770
- You're going down the evil path.
- Seven dollars.

544
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,070
- I have 7 dollars.
- We have 12.5 dollars each.

545
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,640
We have 32 dollars then.

546
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,240
- With Seon Ho, we have 37 dollars.
- We have 37 dollars.

547
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,250
Isn't it better to share 37 dollars
with just the 4 of us?

548
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,710
- It's better to have 37 dollars...
- Hey.

549
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,050
- with the four of us instead of...
- Yes.

550
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,980
- sharing 42 dollars with 6 people.
- Yes.

551
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,020
(It's better to pool money
with the rich.)

552
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,890
Don't you agree? Let's be realistic.

553
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,690
They have five dollars together.

554
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,260
- They'll share jjajangmyeon.
- Hey.

555
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,020
You want us to share jjajangmyeon?

556
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,360
- Right?
- We can order small tangsuyuk.

557
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,790
- We can order small tangsuyuk.
- My gosh.

558
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,160
(Are you seriously going to
do this?)

559
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,760
We can do that, right?
It doesn't matter.

560
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
(Yes, we will.)

561
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,330
Come on. Let's share the food.

562
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,970
Come on, you brat.

563
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,040
(Apologizing to the viewers)

564
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,140
- That's enough.
- Gosh.

565
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,740
Hey. Do you want me
to bury you in the countryside?

566
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,880
I saw an empty spot
next to the chili peppers.

567
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,910
- Great.
- We sorted it out.

568
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,910
- Here's our revised plan.
- Yes.

569
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,080
So what are we going to do?

570
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,920
So the four of us...

571
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,520
will order
large seafood tray jjajangmyeon...

572
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,980
and large brisket jjamppong.

573
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,690
- Then it'd cost 22 dollars.
- Okay.

574
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,720
- We'll order small tangsuyuk.
- You didn't hear me.

575
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,190
- No, wait.
- Okay. Go ahead.

576
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,660
- Come on. Let's share the food.
- Jong Min.

577
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,060
You should try to convince us.

578
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,330
We earned the money by working hard
and winning the game.

579
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,400
But why should we share the food
with you?

580
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,970
You should convince us
why it's better for us.

581
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,870
Jong Min. Are you going to cry?

582
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,040
(Is he tearing up?)

583
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,910
If you can convince us,
we'll let you join us.

584
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,210
- Jong Min. Could you...
- I'm hungry.

585
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,310
- You're just hungry?
- Let's share the food.

586
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,310
(I'm doomed.)

587
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,810
- All right.
- Seriously?

588
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,910
(He fails to convince them.)

589
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,210
(The 2 of them will share
1 bowl of jjajangmyeon.)

590
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,380
- You guys should...
- You two should...

591
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,780
- order jjajangmyeon.
- order jjajangmyeon.

592
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,250
- Okay. I'll tell you what.
- We...

593
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,750
- The reward is the jjajangmyeon.
- Okay.

594
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,120
The winner takes it all.

595
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,120
- I'm in!
- Give us a song or something.

596
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,160
- Okay.
- Yes?

597
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,290
- Darn it.
- Nice.

598
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,000
The winner takes jjajangmyeon.
That's it.

599
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,860
- This will be fun.
- This is good.

600
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,330
It's our money.
So let's do whatever we want.

601
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,730
We'll play it when our food is here,
so it's more nerve-racking.

602
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,300
- Okay.
- As soon as it's served.

603
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,270
Our tangsuyuk is ready.

604
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,910
That's a lot of tangsuyuk.

605
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,840
- That way.
- This way, please.

606
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,780
That's the normal portion.

607
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,110
Pour the sauce
or keep it on the side?

608
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,210
No. I want to dip it
in the sauce separately.

609
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,350
- You want to dip it separately?
- Yes.

610
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,050
You keep the sauce on the side?

611
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,320
(But I like to pour the sauce.)

612
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,650
- I'll pour it on just half of it.
- Okay.

613
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,680
(We can go half and half.)

614
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,850
- All good?
- That's great.

615
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,320
(Combining the crispy tangsuyuk
with the sweet and sour sauce)

616
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,390
- Joon, have some food.
- Dig in.

617
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,530
That looks so good.

618
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,530
(I'm so envious.)

619
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,660
Gosh, this is good.

620
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,060
It's so good.

621
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,900
Ma'am, this is so good.

622
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,230
My gosh. I love this.

623
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,470
- Yes. It's so good.
- My gosh. I love this.

624
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,970
- It's so crispy and tasty.
- Yes, it's good.

625
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,410
(We'd love to have a bite too.)

626
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,410
- You guys should at least enjoy it.
- It's so good.

627
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,010
Gosh,
it's much better than I thought.

628
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,850
You disloyal members.

629
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,410
- Jong Min.
- Did you get that?

630
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,780
Gosh, this is so good.

631
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,550
- Really?
- It's so good.

632
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,580
Really?

633
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,150
(Smacking his lips)

634
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,860
(He keeps on eating pickled radish
while waiting for the food.)

635
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,490
Gosh, jjamppong looks legit.

636
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,190
(The jjamppong's portion is big
just like the owner's generosity.)

637
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,330
- Enjoy.
- Oh, my.

638
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,670
- This looks amazing.
- Oh, my.

639
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,770
That looks amazing.

640
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,700
The fat from the brisket
is infused in the broth.

641
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,470
- Right. The fat...
- It's the meaty broth.

642
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,710
- I bet it's thick.
- Look at the noodles.

643
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,310
The noodles look great.
The noodles are cooked nicely.

644
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,140
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy the food.

645
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,140
Enjoy.

646
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,680
(We'll enjoy the food
on your behalf.)

647
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,050
(Inhaling)

648
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,350
I don't eat a lot.

649
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,290
(Loving the noodles)

650
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,320
Is it good?

651
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,260
This jjamppong
tastes like meat soup.

652
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,890
It tastes like meat soup
because it has a lot of brisket.

653
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,060
- This jjamppong is to die for.
- Really?

654
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,360
(Even the light eater, Cheol,
can't help but slurp the noodles.)

655
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,670
It's the best jjamppong
I had recently.

656
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,570
The broth is really rich.

657
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,040
(As the broth is so rich...)

658
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,400
We have to mix rice in this.

659
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,270
(not mixing rice in it
will be a crime.)

660
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,750
(When they have a big bite
of the rice with the beef brisket,)

661
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,750
(the frown of the truth appears.)

662
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,820
- Is it good?
- Yes.

663
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,250
The jjamppong rice
tastes like beef radish soup.

664
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,320
- Totally.
- Yes.

665
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,360
It tastes like spicy gukbap.

666
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,820
- Totally. That's it.
- It's so good.

667
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,630
I'm getting sweaty
because it's spicy.

668
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,230
It's good.

669
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,860
(The two of them
can only have jjajangmyeon.)

670
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,400
- You're open tomorrow, right?
- What is this?

671
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,500
- Let's come here tomorrow and eat.
- Okay.

672
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,400
- We'll eat all of these.
- Okay.

673
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,410
If we just wait today,
it will be tastier.

674
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,540
Exactly. Let's hang in there.

675
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
We're luckier than them.

676
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,980
- It'll be very delicious tomorrow.
- Right.

677
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,580
Jjajangmyeon is here.

678
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,250
Jjajangmyeon is here.

679
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,680
We'll eat some jjajangmyeon.

680
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,180
- Se Yoon.
- I'll flip the coin.

681
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,790
- Where's the coin? Heads or tails.
- I'll flip it.

682
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,550
- Hurry.
- I pick heads.

683
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,420
- Is heads the number?
- No, the crane.

684
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,460
- The crane?
- Yes.

685
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,190
- Okay, I pick tails.
- To Se Yoon.

686
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,790
- All right.
- Here I go.

687
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,360
Hold this side.

688
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,830
If it's the number, I'll eat.

689
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,100
- If it's the crane...
- I'll eat.

690
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,840
- Here I go.
- I win if it's the number.

691
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,870
- Yes.
- Okay.

692
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,940
All right.

693
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,080
(The coin has been tossed.)

694
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,240
It's done. Let's see.

695
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,940
- Wait.
- Wait.

696
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,810
- Please, let it be the number.
- If it's the number,

697
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,950
- will Se Yoon get to eat?
- Yes.

698
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,580
One, two, three.

699
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,690
What is it?

700
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,820
- What is it?
- It's the crane.

701
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,320
(Heads)

702
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,020
(All the jjajangmyeon
goes to Jong Min.)

703
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,490
(How could you, Director Joo?)

704
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,130
(Darn it!)

705
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,700
(I'm sorry.)

706
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Joo Jong Hyun, darn it!

707
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,970
(While Se Yoon is resenting him)

708
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,970
Goodness.

709
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,870
The serving is very generous.

710
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,070
(I can't wait to eat
some jjajangmyeon.)

711
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,510
The serving is huge.

712
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,710
Look at the color.

713
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,410
It looks like
Jong Min will be eating the most.

714
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,710
Guys, look at this.

715
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,120
The noodles are firm and bouncy.

716
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,950
(Slurping noodles violently
right in front of him)

717
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,790
It looks delicious

718
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,960
The jjajangmyeon looks delicious

719
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,060
(I could've eaten
that jjajangmyeon.)

720
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,930
(Groaning)

721
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,130
Let me borrow a dollar!

722
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,770
(No borrowing is allowed.)

723
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,900
I don't mind even if
it splashes on my clothes.

724
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,910
Shouldn't we give
this to Se Yoon, at least?

725
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,540
- The condiment dish?
- This.

726
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,150
- What's that?
- Serve yourself some food on this.

727
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,780
How many times can I serve myself?

728
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,480
- Let's make it clear.
- The black one.

729
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,650
The white one could be pretty.

730
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,320
- What do you think?
- You can get three servings.

731
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,490
(Se Yoon gets his last chance.)

732
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,190
(His hands are moving...)

733
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,060
(faster than the eyes.)

734
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,300
(Possessed by the hungry spirit,
he starts to analyze.)

735
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,300
(He's done shuffling.)

736
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,340
Cho Sae Ho.

737
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,140
You're right-handed.

738
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,710
You're likely to hold heavy things
in your right hand.

739
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,270
(The soy sauce dish
in his right hand)

740
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,240
Since you're right-handed,
you mixed with your right hand.

741
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,940
You're likely to use the muscles.

742
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,250
You might be holding the black dish
in your right hand,

743
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,050
but I can't bet everything on it.
It's on the left.

744
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,880
- Left?
- Left.

745
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,220
(He picks left.)

746
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,520
- Congratulations.
- Seriously?

747
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,560
(Congratulations)

748
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,290
Thank you.

749
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,630
I switched hands at the last moment.

750
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,560
Thank you. Can I get some of this?

751
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,730
Why are you eating my food?

752
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,770
You have the sauce all over you.

753
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,370
You're covered with greed.

754
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,270
Let's see.

755
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,140
Can't I pile some food
including the tangsuyuk?

756
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,070
Go ahead. Take some rice too.

757
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,780
Wait, Jong Min.
I'll bring us some tangsuyuk.

758
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,780
- Okay.
- Just now,

759
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,050
Sae Ho made a huge mistake.

760
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,180
- Why?
- You have no idea...

761
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,450
how much food Se Yoon can pile up.

762
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,620
Is that so? Wait.

763
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,390
(Running away with the entire plate)

764
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,390
This is creative.
You can't do that.

765
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,590
It's creative.

766
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,030
- I've been observing many things.
- It's creative.

767
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,200
- It's creative.
- I put it on my plate.

768
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,030
- You can't deny it.
- This isn't allowed.

769
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,870
- His creativity was good.
- Why not?

770
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,970
This isn't allowed.

771
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,170
I put it on my plate.

772
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,870
- It was nice and creative.
- You can't take the entire plate.

773
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,000
- Only food is allowed.
- I know.

774
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,640
Thank you anyway, my friend.

775
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,740
I'm going to take this. Thank you.

776
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,850
(The familiar taste of jjajangmyeon
that spreads in the mouth)

777
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,420
- It's tasty.
- Se Yoon,

778
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,950
make sure to try some jjamppong.

779
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,620
- What?
- Try some jjamppong.

780
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,860
The jjamppong is excellent here.

781
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,560
When can I eat it?

782
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,360
(I almost forgot.)

783
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,700
- Do you mean tomorrow?
- No, right now...

784
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,960
Really? This is so delicious.

785
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,470
How can it only cost five dollars?

786
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,830
The jjajangmyeon is good,

787
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,000
- but the jjamppong is to die for.
- The jjamppong is excellent.

788
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,700
I'll eat it tomorrow.

789
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,670
Let's eat some tomorrow. It's good.

790
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,170
It's really delicious.

791
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,510
(He's satisfied with jjajangmyeon
and tangsuyuk for today.)

792
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,080
- It's delicious.
- It's really delicious.

793
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,380
Everyone.

794
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,420
After eating Chinese food,

795
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,150
do you crave beverages like Coke?

796
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,150
Definitely. I'm craving some now.

797
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,290
It leaves a heavy aftertaste.

798
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,690
This is called tangsuyuk game.

799
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,690
Yes?

800
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,600
If your team's representative wins...

801
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,800
Our team's representative?

802
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,060
Whom will he play against?

803
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,970
Me.

804
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,130
(Oh, come on.)

805
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,240
Against you, anyone would win.

806
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,140
- Jong Min, you should play.
- Goodness.

807
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,470
I'm sorry, Director Joo.

808
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,810
I laughed at you too much.

809
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,610
I laughed at him too much.

810
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,010
(Director Joo is known
as the worst player.)

811
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,250
Jong Hyun, you must be
quite narcissistic.

812
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:48,050
Is it because you want to give us
some Coke for free?

813
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,920
It'd be unfair to play
against one of us.

814
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,020
You should play against Jong Min.

815
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,220
I'd like you to drink some Coke.

816
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,330
If I play against Jong Min...

817
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,000
(My goodness)

818
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
He's looking down on you.

819
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,900
It's funny to be scorned by you.

820
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,970
(They scorn each other.)

821
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,070
I bet he studied something.

822
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,840
- No, I didn't study.
- Why don't you do it...

823
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,200
- with "jjamjamyeon?"
- How about "fried dumplings?"

824
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,270
Do it with "jjamjamyeon."

825
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,770
- Jjamjamyeon is difficult.
- Jjamjamyeon?

826
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,180
Let's play.

827
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,180
- Here we go.
- Yes.

828
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,210
You start.

829
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,550
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

830
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,810
(The weakest player
versus the weakest player)

831
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,950
- Here we go.
- Yes.

832
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,520
(Who will be the winner?)

833
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,850
- Jjam.
- Ja.

834
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,890
- Myeon.
- Jjam.

835
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,890
- Ja.
- Myeon.

836
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,050
- Jjam.
- Jjam.

837
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,390
- Myeon.
- You lost.

838
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,220
- You won.
- He's the champion.

839
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,460
- Jjam.
- Jjam.

840
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,800
(They figured out who was weaker.)

841
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,600
He lost to Jong Min.

842
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,300
It can be confusing.

843
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,700
- It was very confusing.
- You must've been confused...

844
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,800
because we did it slowly.

845
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
(An unexpected win thrills him.)

846
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,840
I still thought that
Jong Hyun would win.

847
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,770
When you go out,
I'll give you ten dollars.

848
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,580
- All right.
- You won.

849
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,680
(They won ten dollars
thanks to Jong Min's performance.)

850
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,550
I should watch the video again.
I couldn't concentrate.

851
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,550
(The rising fairy of defeat)

852
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,880
Thank you for the food.

853
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,180
- Let's go to the supermarket.
- I want chestnut ice cream.

854
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,120
We have nothing in the fridge
except for water.

855
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Right.
It's starting to rain.

856
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,360
It's raining heavily
all of a sudden.

857
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,330
I can smell the asphalt
because of the rain.

858
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,560
Shouldn't we fish
under an umbrella when it's raining?

859
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,530
- Right.
- We said that we'd go fishing.

860
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,100
If we fish when it's raining...

861
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,300
Some days, you catch a lot of fish.
Other days, you catch none.

862
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,040
Jong Min,
you're stating the obvious.

863
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,580
(The raindrops slowly start
to wet the rural village.)

864
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,020
(Taking a break in their lodging)

865
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,890
("Meeting" by KOYOTE,
the acoustic guitar version)

866
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,490
Who's singing
with such a sweet voice?

867
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,020
Which song is this?

868
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,190
(It's my song.)

869
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,230
Come here.

870
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,790
(It sounds different
with the acoustic guitar.)

871
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,560
Is this a song by Jong Min?

872
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,100
- Right?
- The original is a ballad song.

873
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,270
- Is it?
- It's a cover song.

874
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,330
The original is by Im Ki Hoon.

875
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,000
- Is this a cover song?
- The original sounds like this.

876
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,710
- Jong Min, is this a cover song?
- Yes.

877
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,240
(Genuinely shocked)

878
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,370
Is the original song
also called "Meeting?"

879
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,380
No, I think
it's "The Day I Met You."

880
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,180
(The original song of "Meeting")

881
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,480
("The Day I Met You" by Im Ki Hoon)

882
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,950
("Meeting" is its cover song
turned into a dance song.)

883
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,720
It's raining again today.

884
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,060
(Full of romance)

885
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,230
Jong Min, now that we took a break,

886
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,430
let's enjoy a leisure sport.

887
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,060
- Shall we go fishing?
- It's not raining anymore.

888
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,470
- Sae Ho, do you want to go fishing?
- Yes, let's go fishing.

889
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,600
- I'm going fishing.
- What?

890
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,500
- I'm going fishing.
- Then I'm going to run.

891
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,740
- Se Yoon, let's run together.
- Yes, take all of those.

892
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,810
I didn't hear you.

893
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,340
Let's run together. I'll teach you.

894
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,940
Go and learn how to run.

895
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,180
- You can't teach me how to run.
- Let's go.

896
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,950
You can learn how to run.

897
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,150
(Suddenly, his face turns grim.)

898
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,750
I'll get changed.

899
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,820
Get changed into what?

900
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,450
I don't want to run.

901
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,950
(Cheol, I'm scared.)

902
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,920
- I don't want to run.
- No. You have to.

903
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,030
Where are you guys going?

904
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,560
(Feeling pressed)

905
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,760
- I'm going fishing.
- Who's going?

906
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
- Me.
- Me.

907
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,060
- What about you?
- I'll just work out here.

908
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,530
- By doing what?
- Muscle training.

909
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,270
- Where should I go?
- You have to run with me.

910
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,440
(Pretending not to hear him)

911
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,770
Joon, what is this part called?

912
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,440
- This is no joke.
- This part.

913
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,810
- By the way...
- It's a workout.

914
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,140
That's insane.

915
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,350
He looks like a man...

916
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,950
in his 80s on "Incredible Moment"
who does bodybuilding.

917
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,550
(His tank top marked by age
and experience)

918
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,750
He'd say, "There's nothing special
about working out."

919
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,820
"You just need to eat and sleep well."
He looks just like him.

920
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,160
What are you doing?

921
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,130
That's funny.

922
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,160
(Coming out)

923
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,930
(The country vacation vest
to show off his muscles)

924
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,000
- What?
- What?

925
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,700
- Come out and learn from him.
- Let's just go.

926
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,000
He's here to inflate his muscles.

927
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,970
Which parts will you work out?

928
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:25,970
Let's try it.
- Over here?
- Yes.

929
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,370
While standing here...

930
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,780
(1. Lift up the weights.)

931
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,180
(2. Do push-ups with the weights.)

932
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,480
(The student only observes him.)

933
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,580
(3. On all fours,
lift the weight on each side.)

934
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,620
Is that how it's done?

935
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,250
(1 set of Lee Joon's weight workout)

936
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,250
This is one set.

937
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,790
Se Yoon, save your energy...

938
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,890
- for the run.
- Why would I run?

939
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,030
Why would I...

940
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,060
- What's that?
- What?

941
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,230
What an unpleasant sight.

942
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,460
- I mean...
- Get ready.

943
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,760
(The running instructor appears.)

944
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,830
- What is it?
- What are you doing?

945
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,300
- What are you doing?
- We need to run.

946
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,970
Your skin is too pale.

947
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,870
- You're too pale.
- What's wrong?

948
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,840
- What's wrong?
- What is this?

949
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,010
- Hey.
- What's wrong with your shorts?

950
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,180
- This is normal.
- They look like your underwear.

951
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,340
That's hilarious.

952
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,450
You're not supposed
to wear underwear.

953
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,380
Jong Min's reaction is hilarious.

954
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,680
That looks nice.

955
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,050
Hurry and get ready.

956
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,620
The more I look at him,
the more annoying he looks.

957
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,690
(Just trust and follow me.)

958
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,690
What's wrong?

959
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,990
(Strangely, his outfit is
infuriating to look at.)

960
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,260
- It's infuriating.
- Why?

961
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,290
Can you show us...

962
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,660
how you run while standing still?

963
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,800
When I run for a long time...

964
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,900
(His infuriating walk)

965
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,330
His legs are so pale.

966
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,070
- It's so...
- Usually, I also wear a hat.

967
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,900
Se Yoon, go and run 3km.

968
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,310
I don't know how to run 3km.

969
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,610
You can run 3km without thinking.

970
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,580
After your run,
come to the fishing area.

971
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,080
Come to the fishing area.

972
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,640
Does it not have wheels?
Do I have to carry it?

973
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,750
You have to carry it.

974
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,150
By the way, where's the reservoir?

975
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,380
It takes five minutes by foot.

976
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,980
Fishing is about waiting,

977
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,390
and it's a fight with carp.

978
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,620
Jong Min and I
promised to go fishing...

979
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,490
outside the shoot
when the weather gets warmer.

980
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,930
We get to go today.

981
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,900
I'm a master of freshwater fishing.

982
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,760
- I'm a master.
- Really?

983
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,800
It's over. I'm too good
for a place like this.

984
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,240
- You can find many types of fish.
- It's beautiful.

985
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,340
It's big and beautiful.

986
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,340
(Goryeo Reservoir on Ganghwa Island)

987
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,880
Fishing will be fun.

988
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,250
The carp at this place
will be beautiful.

989
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,250
- Really?
- Of course.

990
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,880
- I saw fish jumping up.
- Did you see that?

991
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,280
(Dreaming of catching a big fish,
they're both excited.)

992
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,880
- It's over there.
- There's a lot of fish.

993
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,920
That's where fish find
things to eat.

994
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
(They get on the same pedestal.)

995
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,490
You haven't seen me fish, have you?

996
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,630
I only talked about it.

997
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,860
You guys are in big trouble.

998
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,100
You just need to pull. Keep pulling.

999
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,430
All you have to do is
lift it lightly.

1000
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,270
Just yank it when the float moves.

1001
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,570
(The endless waiting starts.)

1002
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,640
Hurry up.

1003
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,580
We have to run now.

1004
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,950
- He wants it badly.
- We don't have much time.

1005
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,150
Hang a piece of sausage
on a wooden stick.

1006
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,250
You'll make him run that way.

1007
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,320
I can't run.

1008
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,820
Warming up is important for you.

1009
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,920
Turn your ankles first.

1010
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,060
(Carelessly turning)

1011
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,030
You shouldn't turn them
so carelessly.

1012
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,030
Let's do this first.

1013
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,130
Keep your shoulders down.
After that...

1014
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,530
- Grab your foot.
- That's it for my workout.

1015
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,640
- Do this.
- Seriously.

1016
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,200
- It says that I walked 200m.
- Do this.

1017
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,310
- That hurts my leg.
- You need to breathe.

1018
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,370
(He's forced to warm up.)

1019
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,580
(Groaning)

1020
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,580
It will start as soon as we run.

1021
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,280
- Let's go.
- You can do it, Se Yoon.

1022
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,190
We will start the run from here.

1023
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
Get ready.
(Se Yoon challenges himself
to run for the first time.)

1024
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,520
Get ready.

1025
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,860
(He is running!)

1026
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,830
Keep your arms close to your chest.

1027
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,830
Instead of running,
think of it as walking fast.

1028
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,400
I can't stop burping.

1029
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,700
We only ran 200m so far.

1030
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,470
Have you run while weighing 120kg?

1031
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,970
- No.
- Then be quiet.

1032
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,210
We can run along the reservoir.

1033
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,240
(They arrive at the reservoir
where the fishing team is.)

1034
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,880
I must be out of my mind
to be doing this.

1035
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,280
It's your first run. Isn't it great?

1036
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,420
- How is it? Is it good?
- Isn't it good?

1037
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,990
Did you get the runner's high yet?

1038
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,220
If you continue running
in the future,

1039
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,560
you'll want to thank me.

1040
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,890
That's why I won't.
I don't want to thank you.

1041
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,860
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

1042
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,630
Which parts shall we work out?

1043
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,870
Let's work out the upper body.

1044
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,840
- The upper body?
- Yes, my legs aren't in shape.

1045
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,800
I have weak biceps,
so I need to work them out.

1046
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,240
Do you want to know an exercise
that burns your biceps?

1047
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,480
- It burns your biceps?
- It's extremely painful.

1048
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,540
(Lee Joon runs a gym.)

1049
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,850
(He exposed his upper body 8 times.)

1050
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,180
It's called 777.

1051
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,250
(777 exercise to train the biceps)

1052
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,950
First, lift the weights halfway
and bend at 90 degrees.

1053
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,720
(1. 7 times from the lowest point
up to the chest)

1054
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,490
Next, from the middle.

1055
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,320
(2. 7 times from the chest
to the highest point)

1056
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,390
After that, it's full-out. One...

1057
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,130
(3. 7 times from the lowest
to the highest point)

1058
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,130
Two.

1059
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,230
Three.

1060
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,770
Gosh, good shot.

1061
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,770
- This will be hard.
- One.

1062
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,740
Two, three,

1063
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,670
four. More.

1064
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,340
Slow down a bit. Five.

1065
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,840
Six. Make it firmer.

1066
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,780
- Seven. Do it full out.
- This time...

1067
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,480
- One.
- It's hard.

1068
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
(Inhaling)

1069
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,950
(His biceps are dominated
by 10kg dumbbells.)

1070
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,550
(Screaming)

1071
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,560
Two.

1072
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,820
Three.

1073
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,990
Make it firm. Four.

1074
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,060
(Moaning)

1075
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,830
Hold them there and lift halfway.

1076
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,970
(He can't move the way he wants.)

1077
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,770
(Shaking)

1078
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,140
All right.

1079
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,210
Six. It's the last one.

1080
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,480
(Mr. Joon doesn't go easy on him.)

1081
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,780
(He barely made it.)

1082
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,880
Ten kilograms is heavy.

1083
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,250
Let's take a short break.

1084
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,820
We can take a break.

1085
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,820
Let's see.

1086
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,650
It pumped up my muscles.

1087
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,960
(The surprising pump effect)

1088
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,990
You're a good instructor.

1089
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,060
(Mr. Joon is very competent.)

1090
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,430
Do you know an exercise
for the chest?

1091
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,760
I do. It's something we can do here.

1092
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,270
- How about on the mat?
- You can do it on the mat.

1093
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,400
Let's do it on the mat.

1094
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,470
Touch the ground.

1095
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,670
One.

1096
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,910
(Chest fly)

1097
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,310
(Concentrating)

1098
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,510
Can I watch you do it
without the top?

1099
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,720
I can't see the muscles right now.

1100
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
(Sae Ho asks him to undress
during the demonstration.)

1101
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,550
- Unbutton my vest.
- It's because I can't see them.

1102
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,620
(Fidgeting)

1103
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,690
It's because I can't see them.

1104
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,430
Like this?

1105
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,260
I see.

1106
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,430
I can't see them.

1107
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,570
Straighten.

1108
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,900
- These muscles are rising.
- Straighten.

1109
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,610
(The stimulated muscles are
clearly visible.)

1110
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,340
Straighten like this.

1111
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,780
All right, I'll try.

1112
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,910
(It's the trainee's turn.)

1113
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,550
By the way,

1114
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,710
I have to look at your muscles too.

1115
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,450
- Can I unbutton it?
- Go ahead.

1116
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,380
- But I...
- Just in case.

1117
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,050
This is how workout YouTubers do it.

1118
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,360
(Exposed)

1119
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
Straighten.

1120
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,060
Straighten.

1121
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,030
Don't make ring sounds
with the dumbbells.

1122
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,330
That's it.

1123
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,700
- My chest is getting torn.
- That's good.

1124
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,330
- All right.
- That's good.

1125
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,370
Aren't you getting too close?

1126
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,710
- All right.
- That's good.

1127
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,080
(In search
for his lost chest muscles)

1128
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,340
Raise your hands.

1129
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,750
Grab them.

1130
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,450
- Start right away.
- Okay.

1131
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,450
Let's go.

1132
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,120
No, you have to lower them more.

1133
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,450
Lower them more.
Touch the ground with your elbows.

1134
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,520
Touch the ground
before coming back up.

1135
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:28,060
(What am I doing right now?)

1136
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,860
- Is this correct?
- It's correct.

1137
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,990
(Happy)

1138
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,060
That was great.

1139
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,630
It looks better now.

1140
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,170
In that short time...

1141
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,270
- Please take a photo of me.
- A photo?

1142
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,010
You look very nice. You look good.

1143
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,770
You look great.

1144
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,210
My goodness. I look great.

1145
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,210
(Mr. Joon's chest workout
is awesome.)

1146
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,110
- How about this?
- Yes?

1147
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,520
Why don't you unbutton
a little more?

1148
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,250
Isn't it better to take it off?

1149
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,520
I might as well...

1150
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,790
- I'll just take it off.
- Did you take it off?

1151
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,790
(He took it off.)

1152
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,500
Sae Ho, let's do something fun.

1153
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,560
(Mr. Joon's secret past
that no one knows at the gym)

1154
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,630
Let's do something fun.

1155
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,640
(When he takes off his top,)

1156
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,570
(he gets excited.)

1157
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,070
It will be difficult.

1158
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,440
(Tough)

1159
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,140
(Sae Ho also gets undressed.)

1160
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,750
- Let's start.
- Okay.

1161
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,050
I'm going to stop.

1162
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,450
(The inferno of endless intervals)

1163
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,490
I want to stop.

1164
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,790
(Mr. Joon who's bulking up)

1165
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,920
(And his new member
who's running endlessly)

1166
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,830
What is this?

1167
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,530
Normally, we have to run.

1168
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,530
(High on adrenaline)

1169
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,440
(Trying to run away)

1170
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:48,970
Where are you going?

1171
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,140
(Sir?)

1172
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,340
- Where are you going?
- I'm right here.

1173
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,340
(He fails to run away.)

1174
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,550
(You're free to come in,
but you aren't free to leave.)

1175
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,080
Why am I doing this?

1176
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,850
(How will
the infernal bulking up end?)

1177
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,350
- My heart is in pain.
- When you breathe...

1178
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,360
My heart is in pain.

1179
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,390
Do you see that over there?

1180
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,290
We'll turn around over there
and go back.

1181
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,990
Shall we run a little faster?

1182
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,060
We're running
at our walking pace now.

1183
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,130
My calves are hurting.

1184
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,800
- My shins hurt.
- That's normal.

1185
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,400
- I can't stand it. My back hurts.
- It's okay.

1186
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,500
You can endure it.

1187
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,840
- It's been seven minutes.
- I know.

1188
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,740
- This is crazy.
- Instead of lying down at home,

1189
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,340
you can move for seven minutes
without a break.

1190
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,940
You can do it.

1191
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,310
One. Keep up with this pace.

1192
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,310
(Running step by step
with the instructor's chant)

1193
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,950
We passed 900m.

1194
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,650
The first 1km
in Moon Se Yoon's life.

1195
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,190
You only have 10m left.

1196
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,590
Go up here.

1197
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,760
(Using every ounce of his strength
while gasping for breath)

1198
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,930
Moon Se Yoon finished his 1km.

1199
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,630
You took 9 minutes 33 seconds.

1200
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,700
(I made it!)

1201
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,930
Nice.

1202
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,470
Well done. Get ready.

1203
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,770
We have to go this way.

1204
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,540
We'll walk this way.

1205
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,540
(Pretending not to hear him)

1206
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,340
Carry me on your back.

1207
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,680
No. Then let's go back.

1208
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,610
I run at this speed.

1209
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,810
(The instructor
with sunglasses is merciless.)

1210
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,650
Come. Run.

1211
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,820
(Running with his face)

1212
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,120
Your posture looks good.

1213
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,550
- You have to keep running.
- I'm sorry.

1214
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,550
Keep running.

1215
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,920
The smell of jjajangmyeon.

1216
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,360
- I can't stop burping.
- We're almost there.

1217
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,860
You can run
when you run with someone.

1218
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,230
- My muscles.
- We're almost there.

1219
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,130
Do you see the house?
We're almost there.

1220
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,500
You're the head of the family.
You can endure this much, can't you?

1221
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,970
What does that have to do with this?

1222
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,670
Seon Ho, please cheer for him.
Here's the finish line.

1223
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,810
How many kilometers did you run?

1224
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,940
- We ran 1.6km without a break.
- Yes!

1225
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
(Not interested)

1226
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,580
We ran 1.6km without a break.

1227
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,210
- I'm going to run a little more.
- Go ahead.

1228
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,720
Look how drenched he is in sweat.

1229
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,850
Look how wet his headband is.

1230
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,720
- Go ahead.
- Here I go.

1231
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,720
What's going on?

1232
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,890
(His instructor goes
to enjoy himself.)

1233
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,690
Running 1.6km felt...

1234
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,330
as painful as running 160km.

1235
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,500
Everyone, please run.

1236
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,570
After the run, you'll get to rest
for so long that you'll be bored.

1237
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,640
(Moon Se Yoon's Run, the end)

1238
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,540
(Groaning)

1239
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,170
(He got cramps in his calves
as an aftereffect from running.)

1240
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,370
Joo Jong Hyun! Darn you.

1241
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,640
(Giggling)

1242
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,810
You said we could just rest. Gosh.

1243
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,310
Se Yoon, I'm sure
you've become healthier.

1244
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,520
Oh, my. He's really fast.

1245
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,120
Catch some fish
so we can have some sashimi later.

1246
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,350
- Okay.
- I'm off.

1247
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,260
Take your time. Don't rush it.

1248
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,360
(They're catching time
instead of fish.)

1249
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,920
It's raining quite heavily.

1250
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,790
Why does it rain
when we just got here?

1251
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,230
We should put on a raincoat.
All right. Now...

1252
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,230
I see a fish jumping up.
There are some carp here.

1253
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,800
Why won't any fish bite the bait?

1254
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,040
(No fish have the intention
of getting caught.)

1255
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,570
A fish always bites bait
at an unexpected moment.

1256
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,770
(They've been fishing for 1 hour
and had no bites.)

1257
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,140
Why aren't any fish biting?

1258
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,010
- There it comes.
- Wait.

1259
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,510
- Wait.
- It's biting.

1260
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,950
- Should I keep waiting?
- Yes, you should wait a bit longer.

1261
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,120
Oh, my.
It went down deeply and quickly.

1262
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,290
- I can see it now.
- That's good. You got it.

1263
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,830
(What did Seon Ho catch?)

1264
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,130
- I'm tired.
- Good job. Yes.

1265
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,600
- But I'm not joking.
- Okay.

1266
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,530
- I feel great.
- Right?

1267
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,200
- My arms look great now.
- Indeed.

1268
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,040
- Do you want to try anything else?
- No, I want to take a break.

1269
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,140
- Okay.
- Yes.

1270
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,210
Why don't you put your vests back on
while taking a break?

1271
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,210
All right.

1272
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,740
- I feel good after working out.
- Yes.

1273
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,750
- Right. You feel good after that.
- Yes.

1274
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,120
(He's not satisfied
for some reason.)

1275
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,620
I can also teach you
how to do squats in a fun way.

1276
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,750
I have to burn the calories
of the jjamppong.

1277
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,520
Just show me how to do it
since I can't do it.

1278
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,820
- Shall I show you?
- Yes.

1279
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,390
I'll show you a simple squat workout
you can do easily at home.

1280
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,060
He'll teach you, viewers.

1281
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,660
- It's Lee Joon's Squat Class.
- You see...

1282
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,700
When I work out by myself at home,

1283
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,900
I do squats for ten minutes
before showering...

1284
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,040
to work up a sweat.

1285
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,670
Here's how I do squats.

1286
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,610
Just squat down like you do
when you sit on a toilet.

1287
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,610
(Sitting on a toilet)

1288
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,780
It's simple. You just have to...

1289
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,720
(Panting)

1290
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,750
What's this sound?

1291
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,820
(The breathing sound disturbs
the squat lesson.)

1292
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,120
The next gym member is here.

1293
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,460
Sir, listen to me.

1294
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,120
You did a good job running.

1295
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,190
Usually,
when people do squats at home,

1296
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,100
they set the goal number of squats.
"I'll just do ten squats."

1297
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,230
But the number of squats you do
doesn't matter at all.

1298
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,900
You must maximize the intensity
while doing each of the squats.

1299
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,500
And repeat doing squats
until you can't do it anymore.

1300
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,400
Even seven squats would do.
The number of squats doesn't matter.

1301
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,870
When you've reached your limit,

1302
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,810
don't stop.

1303
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,080
When you think you can't stand up...
This could seem a little funny.

1304
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,980
Put your hands on the floor.

1305
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,380
- One, two, three...
- I see.

1306
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,380
I'm not joking.

1307
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,220
I'm serious. Try this just once.
You'll be exhausted.

1308
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,720
When you feel like
you can't do any more squats,

1309
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,020
push your hips upward.
One, two, three, four,

1310
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,060
- five, six, seven,
- What is he doing?

1311
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,130
- eight.
- What's with him?

1312
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,290
It's a lower body workout. Nine.

1313
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,260
If regular squats
are regular coffee,

1314
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,960
this kind of squat is
a strong type of coffee.

1315
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,930
(I don't care. I'm tired.)

1316
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,040
(Farting)

1317
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,700
What are you doing right now?
You must've lost your mind.

1318
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,910
(What are you doing right now?
You must've lost your mind.)

1319
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,680
- Why?
- He just farted. Unbelievable.

1320
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
(Angry)

1321
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,680
He must've lost his mind.
Why would he do that?

1322
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,280
I can't help it. I'm sorry.

1323
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,150
- How about you try to do squats?
- Sorry?

1324
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,180
Why don't you try to do squats?

1325
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,220
- No, I don't want to do it.
- Just one set.

1326
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,550
One set? Then show me how to do it.

1327
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,850
Just squat down
as you do when you sit on a toilet.

1328
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,820
It'll come out if I do that now.

1329
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,030
I'm sorry. I'll try it later.

1330
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,630
You heard that one just now, right?

1331
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,830
- Until you can't lift them up.
- Try it, Se Yoon.

1332
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,970
We even took off our vests earlier
to do this workout.

1333
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,530
We worked out really hard earlier.

1334
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,200
If I take my shirt off,

1335
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,540
some piglets might come
and try to latch onto my nipples.

1336
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,840
(Mommy)

1337
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,840
Calling me "Mommy."

1338
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,080
I can breastfeed only two of them.

1339
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,010
- Have you finished your workout?
- Yes.

1340
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,710
In any case... Yes, we have.

1341
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,250
(The gym is closed as the members
are not feeling well.)

1342
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,250
They're exhausted, apparently.

1343
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,520
Did you run far?

1344
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,620
- I ran 3km more.
- Really?

1345
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,720
(DinDin, who went for a run alone,
is back too.)

1346
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:38,890
Can you play this song?

1347
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,320
(Singing gibberish)

1348
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,320
What song is that?

1349
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,990
(You mean, a song like this?)

1350
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,930
("Rainy Street" by Lee Seung Hoon)

1351
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:55,840
(We enjoy ourselves with no worries
on Our Own Country Vacation.)

1352
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:01,140
(Happy)

1353
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,250
(The best song choice
for a rainy day)

1354
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:14,790
(Listening to the song comfortably
while lying down)

1355
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,660
Hey, guys!

1356
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,300
What... Did you catch a fish?

1357
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,370
Did you see what we caught?

1358
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,940
- We caught a fish for dinner.
- Really?

1359
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,170
- You'll be surprised.
- Stop lying.

1360
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,210
(He shows them the bucket
with confidence.)

1361
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,940
- I bet there's no fish in there.
- All I can hear is a rock rattling.

1362
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,740
- Gosh. Come on.
- Did you catch no fish?

1363
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,750
(Empty)

1364
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,880
I feel bad for them, though.

1365
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,580
Jong Min has never caught a fish
on 2 Days and 1 Night.

1366
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,120
- Why is there so much water plants?
- There's much of it here.

1367
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,590
- What are you doing?
- Spit it out!

1368
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,860
(He suffers
from a severe aftereffect.)

1369
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,500
(He looks as if he were getting
an electric shock.)

1370
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,930
(Be sure to do warm-ups
before going for a run.)

1371
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:57,930
It hurts. What's the point
of doing this after running?

1372
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,240
That's enough.

1373
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,140
(While they are
having fun together...)

1374
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,970
Everyone, please come out.

1375
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,140
(Come out?)

1376
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,110
- Jong Min, let's go.
- Okay.

1377
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,920
- They want us to be out.
- I'm sleepy now.

1378
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,120
It's really fun to fish in summer.

1379
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,420
(They go out of the house for now.)

1380
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,190
- Gosh, it's hot.
- Oh, what?

1381
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,460
What's going on?
What's with the table tennis table?

1382
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,120
Why? What are we going to do now?

1383
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,060
(He senses that something's wrong.)

1384
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,630
- My gosh. What's this?
- What?

1385
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,230
- Table tennis?
- There must be something wrong.

1386
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,230
- Table tennis?
- What's this?

1387
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,530
- So it has begun finally.
- Are we going to play a game?

1388
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,030
I knew it.
This was never an easy one.

1389
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,200
It has just begun, right?

1390
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,440
Are you enjoying
your country vacation?

1391
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,470
- Yes, this is nice.
- Yes. I'm so excited.

1392
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:37,670
We can have fun and take a nap.

1393
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:40,210
Today, you must prepare dinner,

1394
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,110
tidy up the place,

1395
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,150
- and make a bed by yourselves.
- My goodness.

1396
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,950
But it's not that
all of you have to do the work.

1397
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,020
- Absolutely.
- That's right.

1398
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,620
- Three of us could do all that.
- Okay.

1399
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,490
Sae Ho shared
an idea for a new game with us,

1400
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,820
which we're grateful for.

1401
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,360
- A game?
- Oh, you're talking about that.

1402
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,530
- What is it?
- I see that Sae Ho works hard.

1403
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,530
- What's that idea?
- What is it?

1404
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,600
Sae Ho can't move his legs,

1405
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
but he can use his arms. So...

1406
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,600
- Hey, what are you talking about?
- He can move his legs.

1407
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,000
- He can move his legs.
- His legs are fine.

1408
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,200
- That's not what I meant.
- A game involving leg movements...

1409
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,400
- could be challenging for him.
- He has a problem with his leg.

1410
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,670
- In this part of my leg.
- Yes.

1411
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:12,070
So you're going to play the game
that Sae Ho suggested...

1412
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,210
to select two workers...

1413
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:16,150
who will be
your hands and feet today.

1414
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,180
Two out of the six members?

1415
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,880
I'll explain about the game first.

1416
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,880
Hit as many cups and bottles
as you can...

1417
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,920
with table tennis balls
within 30 seconds.

1418
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,790
- The ones with higher scores win.
- Okay.

1419
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:28,120
The two with the lowest scores
will be the workers, naturally.

1420
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,060
What should the two workers do?

1421
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,230
If you're chosen as a worker,

1422
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,400
you should run small errands
for the other members,

1423
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,800
prepare dinner,

1424
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,870
and make bed for all members.

1425
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:37,970
- The two workers should do those?
- Yes.

1426
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,170
The workers should even
lay out beddings?

1427
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,140
If someone asks for water,
the workers should fetch water?

1428
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,170
- That can be an example.
- This is the worst.

1429
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,370
They'll be slaves for the others.

1430
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,610
"I'm going to fart.
Put your face close to my butt."

1431
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,750
What kind of life are you leading?

1432
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,810
What do you do for fun
alone at home?

1433
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,320
Who would make such a demand?

1434
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
(I was joking.)

1435
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,450
You can decide the order
just as you want.

1436
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,320
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1437
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,420
- Joon, when do you want to do it?
- I'll go last.

1438
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,460
I'll go fifth.

1439
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,490
- Then I'll go 3rd.
- I'll go 2nd.

1440
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,830
Se Yoon will go first.
We'll start with Se Yoon.

1441
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,860
- "You punk."
- That must be his strategy.

1442
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,700
- I'll go with the You Punk Method.
- Get ready.

1443
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,600
- This is nerve-racking.
- Okay. Good.

1444
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,600
- Are you ready?
- "You punk."

1445
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,700
- You've got this!
- You've got this!

1446
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,070
- Let's go!
- Ready.

1447
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,810
- Set.
- Se Yoon!

1448
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,510
Se Yoon, hit the third one!

1449
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:21,840
That's good. You're doing great.

1450
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,350
You're doing an excellent job.
You're amazing.

1451
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,710
Wait. What?

1452
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,850
Oh, my. He's really good at it.

1453
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,120
(After hitting
two 5-point targets...)

1454
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,890
(He only hits 5-point targets.)

1455
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:34,890
(He gains another 5 points.)

1456
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,360
How many five-point targets
has he hit so far?

1457
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,260
Hey, he hit 10 5-point targets.

1458
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:42,060
He can't hit any of the big ones.
Hey, you're doing well.

1459
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:44,470
You're doing just great.

1460
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,170
(He gains 50 points!)

1461
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,200
(Awesome)

1462
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,910
(He hit the 100-point target,
but he failed to make it fall off.)

1463
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:55,480
- What are you doing?
- Se Yoon, keep going.

1464
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,480
(Disappointed)

1465
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,550
- Five, four, three...
- That's good.

1466
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,420
- Nice!
- Se Yoon, what are you doing?

1467
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,920
- One.
- It's over!

1468
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,520
- He did a great job.
- It was harder than I thought.

1469
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:07,690
It seems fun.

1470
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:08,760
- Se Yoon.
- You hit this one.

1471
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,760
- Oh, good.
- It's a 50-point target.

1472
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,590
- Really?
- I hit a 50-point target, at least.

1473
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,060
- You did a very good job.
- Se Yoon's score is 70 points.

1474
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,030
- Okay. That was good.
- That's a high score.

1475
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,030
I think I did well.

1476
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,200
He did better than I expected.

1477
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,500
Had I not gone for a run...

1478
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,600
(He ran out of energy.)

1479
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,910
- Jong Min, are you ready?
- Yes.

1480
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,040
- Hold on. Just in case.
- Ready.

1481
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,640
I'll put this here.

1482
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,710
It might be flown away.

1483
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:28,740
(A spare racket to be used
in case his racket is flown away)

1484
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,750
- You should use just one racket.
- No. You never know.

1485
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,480
- That's not allowed.
- You should use just one racket.

1486
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,250
- I'll cherish it.
- Jong Min, are you ready?

1487
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,220
- Yes.
- Here we go. Ready.

1488
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,220
Please.

1489
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,550
Set.

1490
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,990
Hey, throw it lightly.

1491
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,660
(He missed the targets.)

1492
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,560
(He gains 15 points,
and then he gets another 15 points.)

1493
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,130
(He gains 5 points.)

1494
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,470
(After hitting
three 5-point targets...)

1495
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,940
(Just like Se Yoon,
he only hits 5-point targets.)

1496
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,010
They're all 5-point targets.
That's 5 points too.

1497
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,240
They're all 5-point targets...
Oh, my.

1498
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,580
(He gains 50 points!)

1499
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,350
(No...)

1500
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,750
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

1501
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,780
- He doesn't know how to hit it.
- You have ten seconds left.

1502
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,720
(Maybe he got tired.
He keeps groaning.)

1503
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,990
- No. Please.
- Gosh.

1504
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,220
(Laughing)

1505
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,430
(He feels pity for Jong Min
for some reason.)

1506
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,760
- Three, two, one.
- Aim at Director Joo.

1507
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,230
- Okay.
- It's over.

1508
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,130
- Let's check.
- What's his score?

1509
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,300
- He did well.
- That's 55 points.

1510
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,200
- He hit many targets.
- His score must be high.

1511
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:28,100
Jong Min's score is 105 points.

1512
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,140
(Jong Min gained 105 points.)

1513
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,270
- I did better than Se Yoon.
- That's 20 points.

1514
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,040
- Fifty points.
- I beat him.

1515
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,180
- He did very well.
- I beat Se Yoon.

1516
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,710
- I've got this!
- Here goes the third player.

1517
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,480
- Ready.
- Sae Ho, you can do this!

1518
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,580
Sae Ho, you can... Oh, my.

1519
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,720
(Sae Ho hit a 50-point target
as soon as he started.)

1520
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,890
- He hit no five-point ones.
- What?

1521
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,260
(He gains 15 and 80 points
at the same time.)

1522
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:54,130
- Only five seconds have passed.
- He already got many points.

1523
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,560
You were too hasty.

1524
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,130
That's a 100-point target.

1525
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,230
(He hit the 100-point target,
but it didn't fall off.)

1526
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,340
(Sae Ho hit the 100-point target.)

1527
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,310
Stop it now.
(He lost the will to play.)

1528
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,350
Five, four,

1529
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,850
three, two, one.

1530
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:18,850
I'm sure he practiced this
with his wife.

1531
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,320
No! How could I have practiced this?

1532
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,020
- He practiced it with his wife.
- I'm sure he practiced.

1533
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,460
- He practiced for sure.
- I know.

1534
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,090
- Where would I practice this?
- At your place!

1535
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,430
How can you practice this at home?

1536
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,530
Please check his shopping history.
I'm sure he got the ping-pong table.

1537
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,600
Sae Ho earned 275 points.

1538
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,700
(Sae Ho earned 275 points.)

1539
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,440
I think it will be Se Yoon and Joon.

1540
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,500
(Se Yoon and Joon
will be the workers.)

1541
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,070
You are in last place as well.

1542
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:39,240
But Joon can't score at all.

1543
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,780
So it's Joon then.

1544
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:43,080
- You still have chances.
- Right.

1545
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,650
- It makes me nervous.
- Right, I'm nervous.

1546
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,480
- It's fun.
- Director, be careful.

1547
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,550
(Bluffing)

1548
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:48,580
(What is he saying?)

1549
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,790
You will get 1,000 points
if you make the director fall.

1550
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,220
I should play as I usually do.

1551
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,820
You'll only hit the ball
when you play as you usually do.

1552
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,820
All right, let's start. Ready?

1553
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:56,990
Making it fall off must be hard.

1554
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,130
He hit the 100-point target.

1555
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:00,600
(DinDin hits the 100-point target.)

1556
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,660
(He couldn't make it fall off,
although he hit it right.)

1557
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,200
(Shocked, thinking
DinDin got 100 points)

1558
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,140
- He only hits the 100-point target.
- That's fast. What?

1559
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,370
- Great! You're doing amazing.
- He's good.

1560
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,940
Okay, that's great.

1561
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,440
- Okay, you're doing great.
- You're doing great.

1562
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,710
- All right, hit it again.
- Keep going.

1563
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:17,080
- Look at how he smashes.
- He's really good.

1564
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,080
(He still has only 25 points.)

1565
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,050
(Se Yoon won't be in last place
if DinDin keeps up this way.)

1566
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:23,220
Oh, what's going on? No!

1567
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:26,050
Oh, what's going on? No!

1568
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,320
(DinDin hits the 100-point target.)

1569
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,630
(Then he hits the 50-point target
right after.)

1570
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:35,760
(He saves his life 10 seconds
before the game ends.)

1571
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,800
Ten seconds!

1572
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,870
(10 points earned, 5 points earned)

1573
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:42,040
(Why is he good at it
all of a sudden?)

1574
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,140
What? Why is he good?

1575
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,370
Two, one.

1576
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,010
That's it.
He got the 100-point target.

1577
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,580
Hey, Sae Ho.

1578
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,650
- Suggest such games more. It's fun.
- Great.

1579
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,380
I mean he was leading...

1580
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,450
(Se Yoon remains
in last place again.)

1581
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,350
But DinDin
could have been in big trouble.

1582
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:56,380
I know. It could've been bad.

1583
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,420
You would have lost if it weren't
for the 100-point target.

1584
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,190
- You were flustered, right?
- Yes.

1585
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,060
Let me announce the scores.

1586
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,190
Sae Ho earned 275 points.

1587
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,590
- That's a lot.
- Goodness.

1588
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,930
- DinDin earned 190 points.
- Okay.

1589
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,430
Jong Min earned 105 points.

1590
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:09,560
That's not bad.

1591
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,930
Se Yoon earned 70 points.

1592
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:12,030
(Another worker candidate)

1593
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:13,670
I want to play this again.

1594
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,370
I should make Se Yoon run
if he becomes our slave.

1595
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:18,410
(Laughing)

1596
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:21,010
We can make him get meat
from a store that's 3km away.

1597
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:23,480
- Don't call me a slave.
- No, a worker.

1598
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,380
- A slave.
- Okay, a worker sounds fine.

1599
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,180
We don't know yet.
Their play might be bad.

1600
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,950
All right, it's Seon Ho's turn.

1601
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,250
As long as I get 100 points...

1602
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,420
- I think he won't get it.
- I know.

1603
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,630
- Look at the skinny boy.
- Goodness.

1604
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:37,660
- He's as thin as a toothpick.
- Gosh, his arm.

1605
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:38,660
(His smash looks somewhat weak.)

1606
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,760
- Gosh, that Paper Doll.
- He isn't the important one here.

1607
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,900
(Trying to bribe the helper)

1608
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,130
We don't want to get uncomfortable,
you got that?

1609
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:45,670
Throw it like this.

1610
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:46,870
(Throwing)

1611
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,270
Nobody is going to say anything.
Make yourself at home.

1612
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,110
Hey, come on now. Mister.

1613
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,680
- Let's start now.
- I'll step away a little.

1614
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,080
Start.

1615
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,210
- There you go.
- Great.

1616
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,350
(Missing the ball)

1617
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,710
- There you go.
- Great.

1618
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,480
- You're doing great, Seon Ho.
- There you go.

1619
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,550
(His swing looks unstable
from the start.)

1620
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,990
- What if he hits the 100-point...
- All right! We got this!

1621
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,020
- We got this.
- We got this.

1622
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,890
(The ball won't even reach
the target.)

1623
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,290
(Great, I won't be a worker.)

1624
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:10,360
- We got this! Yes.
- We got this.

1625
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,030
(He finally earned 15 points.)

1626
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,360
(50 points earned, 15 points earned)

1627
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,800
- He beat Se Yoon.
- He will never make it.

1628
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,130
(15 points earned)

1629
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,400
(Seon Ho earned 80 points
in no time.)

1630
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,540
(Se Yoon failed to escape
from being the worker.)

1631
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,740
Oh, no. He's getting it.

1632
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,710
Gosh, he's getting it.

1633
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,240
(Seon Ho beats Jong Min
as he scores another 50 points.)

1634
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,040
- That's more than 100 points...
- One more shot.

1635
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,650
(10 points earned)

1636
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,880
- Hit the 100-point target again.
- Five,

1637
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,450
four,

1638
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:36,120
three, two, one.

1639
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,120
He earned more than 100 points.

1640
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,660
Seon Ho earned 140 points.

1641
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,860
(Seon Ho earned 140 points.)

1642
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,430
- Se Yoon's the worker for sure.
- He is the worker for sure.

1643
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,760
- I am.
- You're the worker now.

1644
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,630
I don't want to do this with him.

1645
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,200
It makes me even angrier
when he teases me.

1646
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,000
All right, I'll start.

1647
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,600
Joon, are you ready?

1648
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,640
(Screaming)

1649
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,570
Let's go!

1650
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,170
Joon, please!

1651
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,840
Joon can never get this.

1652
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,350
I feel like I'm playing
for the Summer Games.

1653
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,720
Please!

1654
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,080
Joon, please.

1655
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:09,920
You can do this. You're strong.

1656
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,120
- Your muscles aren't for fashion.
- Please.

1657
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,950
Please.
I can't stand him teasing me.

1658
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,760
Please let me get a break.

1659
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,060
It's Jong Min versus Joon.

1660
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,130
All right, let's start. Ready?

1661
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,560
- Start.
- Hit it toward the sky.

1662
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,430
- The snap.
- Hit it toward the sky!

1663
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,270
- Hit it toward the sky!
- You're doing great.

1664
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,800
- Oh, great.
- No!

1665
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,900
(His play is different this time.)

1666
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,840
(He hits the 50-point target
as soon as he starts.)

1667
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,480
(Flustered at the high score
from the start)

1668
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,380
- Great. One more time. That's it.
- No!

1669
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,880
(Gym Lover's leading a good start.)

1670
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,410
- There you go.
- He's good.

1671
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:41,050
- You're doing great.
- Hit it hard.

1672
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,020
- You're doing just fine.
- Hit it hard.

1673
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,950
- It has been ten seconds.
- Joon, you're doing just fine.

1674
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:48,290
- Joon, make the target fall off.
- Hit it harder.

1675
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,290
(Screaming)
- Hit it to the ground.
- Die!

1676
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,960
- There you go. To the ground.
- Die!

1677
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,130
- To the ground!
- What's happening?

1678
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,430
(He won't be the worker
if he scores another 45 points.)

1679
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:57,500
- There you go. Good.
- Here!

1680
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,570
Hit it to the ground.

1681
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,200
(Missing)

1682
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,200
The ball only goes through the gaps.

1683
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:12,180
(Interestingly enough, the ball
only goes through the gaps.)

1684
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,980
(This surely is a talent.)

1685
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,320
- Gosh, what's going on?
- No.

1686
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,550
- Great.
- Four, three,

1687
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,520
- two, one.
- Great.

1688
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,420
- You...
- You idiot.

1689
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:22,920
Joon is the worker.

1690
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,030
(He is the worker.)

1691
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,060
- He's so bad at this.
- But his ball was precise...

1692
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,570
He hit it toward the gaps only.

1693
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,670
That means he's a good player.

1694
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,140
He's good at this.

1695
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,870
- He hit it toward the gaps only.
- This is hard.

1696
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,040
I'll tell you the final scores.

1697
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,510
Se Yoon earned 70 points.

1698
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,840
- Joon scored 65 points.
- No.

1699
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,910
You're both workers now.

1700
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,910
(Joon and Se Yoon
are the workers for tonight.)

1701
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:48,280
You will see an ice box up there.

1702
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,450
- Please get me cold water.
- Yes, do that.

1703
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,890
- Joon.
- Will you be going?

1704
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,420
- Clothes for the workers?
- That's right.

1705
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,520
Clothes for the workers.

1706
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,520
(You have clothes for the workers?)

1707
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,890
Give me Se Yoon's too.
Please take off your shirts now.

1708
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:00,130
I'm glad, though.
They might have to cook.

1709
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,430
- Se Yoon is good at cooking.
- He is.

1710
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,830
Here you go.

1711
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:04,430
(Getting changed
into workers' outfits)

1712
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,230
- Joon.
- Yes?

1713
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,400
Please push back your hair.

1714
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,770
- We have to wear this too.
- Right.

1715
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:12,110
- What's that?
- You have to work...

1716
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:13,810
whatever is needed
for the country vacation.

1717
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:16,340
Workers, please make sure...

1718
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,150
to prepare dinner for them.

1719
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:21,380
Today's dinner menu is barbeque...

1720
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,550
that goes well
with the country vacation.

1721
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,250
- That'd be nice.
- Barbeque?

1722
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,620
He's good at this.

1723
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:28,490
(A barbecue is a must
on the country vacation.)

1724
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,730
I'll be providing 200 dollars...

1725
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:33,330
for you to go grocery shopping.

1726
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,530
Is this your last day?

1727
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,130
What's wrong with you?

1728
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,870
- It's like you're being rebellious.
- Are you going somewhere?

1729
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:40,800
There is a supermarket around here.

1730
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,100
There's a seafood market,
as well as many restaurants.

1731
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,270
Should we grill some clams?

1732
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,640
Seafood?

1733
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,880
- Shrimps?
- How about...

1734
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,840
- Get us pen shells and scallops.
- Then...

1735
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,750
Let's get scallops and beef brisket
for a combo meal.

1736
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,280
- Mushrooms.
- Make a good meal.

1737
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,980
Can we have scallops with cheese?

1738
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,620
- Of course.
- Nice.

1739
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,950
Joon, get us water...

1740
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:58,620
from the ice box.

1741
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,160
Four bottles.

1742
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,320
- Four bottles.
- But this is...

1743
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,090
- Sure.
- Sing for us now.

1744
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,390
(Singing right away)

1745
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,030
(We surely have good workers.)

1746
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,630
(We can see the future
of the workers.)

1747
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:11,700
Great.

1748
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,400
- Okay, that was amazing.
- All right.

1749
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,470
He's good.

1750
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:17,540
- Thank you.
- You can go shopping now.

1751
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,640
Do we take a break
until they come back?

1752
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,380
Yes.

1753
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,580
I should take a nap.

1754
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,010
Just because
I wasn't good at table tennis,

1755
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,780
I ended up as a worker.

1756
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:30,080
That's life.

1757
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,290
They don't know how much
it would cost. We have 200 dollars.

1758
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,560
Do you think we should eat
and go back?

1759
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,590
Of course, I thought about that.

1760
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:39,360
- You did? Are you sure?
- Yes.

1761
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,730
Let's check if we can eat something
before we go back.

1762
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:42,860
(The two workers dream
of committing a crime in secret.)

1763
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,030
We can get a glass of slushy
or something.

1764
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,800
Let's just pass out
after we have slushies.

1765
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,640
- We'll pass out after having it.
- Sure.

1766
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,470
We're here at the seafood market.

1767
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,070
Let's get out.

1768
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,610
It looks like we're shooting
"My Hometown at 6pm."

1769
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,840
I know.

1770
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,580
"We're here at a seafood market..."

1771
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,520
"in Oepo-ri, Ganghwa-gun."

1772
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,390
- We can find direct sellers here.
- Right, Oepo Port.

1773
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:05,920
We're here to get seafood
directly from the sellers.

1774
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,220
(Fresh)

1775
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,930
I love seafood smells like this.

1776
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,430
(Going inside the market
feeling excited)

1777
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:15,930
- Goodness.
- Hello.

1778
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,600
- I see crabs.
- Hello.

1779
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,630
(They reached a stall where they
sell different types of seafood.)

1780
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,070
- Hello.
- Do you have scallops?

1781
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:24,110
- We have pen shells.
- How much is it?

1782
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,710
Please give me five pieces.

1783
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,080
She'll steam the scallops for us.

1784
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,640
That would be 40 dollars
for 5 pieces.

1785
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,550
Yes, give us 1kg of it.

1786
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,750
That's all we want.

1787
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,520
Do you happen to have
salted oysters with hot pepper?

1788
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,320
- It surely tastes great.
- Taste it.

1789
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,020
- Does it smell good?
- Goodness.

1790
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,520
We have to get this.

1791
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:47,500
Can we taste it? Thank you.

1792
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,430
We have to get this.
It's so delicious.

1793
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,730
I've never heard of this.

1794
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,670
Should we try it as well?

1795
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,940
The salted oysters with hot pepper
taste really good.

1796
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,270
(They purchase the salted oysters
with hot pepper perfect with rice.)

1797
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:00,210
We can eat rice with just this.

1798
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,240
This is crazy.

1799
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,210
If we grill meat and eat it
with scallops, it's amazing.

1800
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,410
- Right.
- Yes.

1801
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:07,950
(Meanwhile, she's preparing
the pen shells.)

1802
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,250
(Attracting his attention)

1803
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:12,690
(Only the flesh of the thick pen shells
are packed.)

1804
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,360
That looks good.

1805
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,730
(Feeling dizzy)

1806
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:20,260
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1807
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,330
I'll carry one.

1808
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:23,160
- It's okay.
- We have to go this way.

1809
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,470
We should hurry back to cook.

1810
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,730
Thank you.

1811
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:26,940
- Bye.
- Bye.

1812
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,270
Let's go to the supermarket now.

1813
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,710
Are they really relaxing?

1814
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,710
- This is fun.
- It's really healing.

1815
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:35,380
Has it ever been like this before?

1816
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:38,110
Lightly. That's right!

1817
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:39,450
Nice.

1818
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,420
(A recovery massage after a run
is a must.)

1819
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,450
(They had all the fun,
and now it's nap time again.)

1820
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,650
Should we take a cart?

1821
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,090
- Let's do that.
- Yes.

1822
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,930
This is barley.

1823
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:52,960
It's 12 dollars for 2.5kg.

1824
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,730
This is 5 dollars for 4kg.

1825
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,630
- Let's get these two.
- Okay.

1826
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,400
- These two should be enough.
- Okay.

1827
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,970
We have to get kimchi.

1828
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,440
Common kimchi.

1829
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,040
That's enough.

1830
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,110
This one? Wait. It's packed.

1831
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,880
Let's get meat first.

1832
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:09,480
We're five. Okay.

1833
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,250
- This is enough.
- Wait.

1834
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,550
It's more than enough.

1835
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,480
Get some pork jowl if there is any.

1836
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,680
Pork jowl.

1837
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,550
Pork jowl is expensive. Gosh.

1838
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:19,690
I don't like pork neck.

1839
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:20,720
(But he'd make a fuss.)

1840
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,590
Okay. Let's get pork belly
and pork jowl.

1841
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,230
Really? But the money...

1842
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,890
Do we have enough money?

1843
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:27,400
I think it would be fine.

1844
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,560
Let's see how much it is.

1845
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

1846
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,340
- We're curious how much this is.
- Could we...

1847
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,740
- Okay.
- We don't have so much money.

1848
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:39,010
- Take out what you don't need.
- Okay.

1849
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,310
- We'll do that.
- I'm sorry.

1850
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,510
Just put what we really need.

1851
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:44,810
And...

1852
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,350
(Will they have enough money
for the slushy?)

1853
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:47,820
(Purchased Items)

1854
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:48,880
Yes.

1855
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,350
Take a look at the price.

1856
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:52,020
It's okay.

1857
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,860
It's 87 dollars. It's 88 dollars.

1858
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,590
It's 117 dollars. It's 122 dollars.

1859
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,660
- How much do we have?
- We have 130 dollars.

1860
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,690
No!

1861
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,860
(The amount goes over 130 dollars.)

1862
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,630
It's more than 130 dollars.
We can't get slushies.

1863
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,370
We'll remove the pork jowl.

1864
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,240
We'll remove the broth too.

1865
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,240
(They take out
the budae stew broth.)

1866
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,410
We can't get slushies.

1867
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,010
It's 121.7 dollars. It's good.

1868
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:14,210
- Hold on.
- What?

1869
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,640
We should have 5 dollars each.

1870
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:18,650
We'll take this out too.

1871
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,620
We'll be able to eat a lot.

1872
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,820
We'll take these.

1873
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,820
(Final price: 117 dollars)

1874
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,290
I'm sorry.

1875
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,060
Do you have Nonghyup points?

1876
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,190
- Points?
- Yes.

1877
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,330
It's 117.19 dollars.

1878
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:33,260
(They really need the points now!)

1879
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:35,400
Are there points under my name?

1880
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,730
(How many points does Se Yoon have?)

1881
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,070
- How much is there?
- Zero points.

1882
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,040
Okay. Darn it.

1883
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:42,670
Really?

1884
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,640
But you got a 50-cent discount.

1885
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:45,810
How?

1886
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:46,940
Because you're a member.

1887
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,710
I'm a member? All right.

1888
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,350
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1889
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,510
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1890
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:54,120
(Current balance: 13 dollars)

1891
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,680
Let's...

1892
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,020
have some snacks before we go back.

1893
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:01,260
We should get something
to be motivated to work.

1894
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,890
We should eat something sweet.

1895
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,860
There must be something around here.

1896
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:07,900
What about twisted donuts?

1897
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,000
- There...
- There are twisted donuts.

1898
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,070
- Should we go in there?
- Do you want twisted donuts?

1899
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,170
- Let's eat twisted donuts.
- It's for the sake of fun.

1900
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:15,570
- It's for fun.
- Yes.

1901
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,340
If we get nine twisted donuts...

1902
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,940
So 3 times 5 is 15, 3 times 6...
It's 7.5 dollars.

1903
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:20,110
It would be just the right amount.

1904
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,310
Okay.

1905
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:22,610
Hello.

1906
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:24,110
- What's this?
- You startled me.

1907
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:25,910
- It's here.
- This looks good.

1908
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,350
Slushies are two dollars.

1909
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,920
- Let's get one each.
- We could eat this.

1910
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,550
- They had slushies here.
- Let's get them.

1911
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,560
It's...

1912
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,960
It's fascinating that they have
what we so wanted.

1913
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,930
We really wanted slushies,
and they were right here.

1914
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,260
Should we eat some here?

1915
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,400
Let's eat. Can we eat it?

1916
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:50,840
(Joon takes a sip of the slushy,
his soul food.)

1917
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,810
(The refreshing taste of the slushy)

1918
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,940
Where is the donut?

1919
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,010
Let's eat.

1920
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:57,310
(Se Yoon quickly joins
with the twisted donuts.)

1921
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:06,420
(Freshly fried twisted donuts
can't taste bad.)

1922
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,460
Twisted donuts
should be eaten fresh.

1923
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,190
(This is the taste of freedom.)

1924
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,160
This is great.

1925
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,970
(Se Yoon gets a sip
of the slushy too.)

1926
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,730
Hold on. Gosh, my head.

1927
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,810
Have you ever fainted
after drinking a slushy?

1928
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:27,410
- No. You fainted?
- I did when I was in high school.

1929
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:30,310
- You actually fainted?
- Yes.

1930
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:32,280
The machine used to be outside,

1931
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,810
so I could pour myself a cup.

1932
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,880
When it gets full,
you just close the lid and go.

1933
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,120
What I did was...

1934
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:39,020
I suck on the straw
while pulling the lever.

1935
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,520
(He wanted to drink more,)

1936
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,390
(and he fainted.)

1937
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:48,100
When I woke up,
my friends were stepping on me.

1938
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,230
"What are you doing?"
They thought I was joking.

1939
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:53,270
My head hurt.

1940
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:55,000
(Do not try this.)

1941
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,040
Seriously.

1942
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,610
That never happened to me.

1943
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:01,040
(There are still
10 twisted donuts left.)

1944
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,740
Raise your hand
if you want a twisted donut.

1945
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,110
Okay. First letter.

1946
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,280
Quack.

1947
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,020
- Second letter.
- I'm hungry.

1948
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,920
- Third letter.
- Let's energize.

1949
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,150
Amazing.

1950
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,120
I knew it.

1951
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:15,590
Why are you so good?

1952
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,290
- Why are you so good?
- You did great.

1953
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,630
He really...

1954
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,960
What was that?

1955
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,600
Who else wants a twisted donut?

1956
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:27,740
- Thank you.
- Take a bite from here.

1957
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:28,940
Tell us how it tastes.

1958
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:33,040
- Please describe the taste.
- ASMR.

1959
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:35,740
(Teary-eyed)

1960
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,010
Thank you.

1961
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,350
(Laughing)

1962
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:41,650
It's the raw reaction of an amateur.

1963
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:43,580
- It's raw.
- He's good.

1964
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,850
Do you have a girlfriend?

1965
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:46,820
- I have someone I like.
- Someone you like?

1966
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,420
- Hold on.
- Don't say her name.

1967
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,660
(A message for his crush)

1968
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:51,490
Say something to her
while eating the twisted donut.

1969
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:52,830
How are you?

1970
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,470
(He spurts out the slushy.)

1971
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:00,000
(Choking)

1972
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:01,770
(He's confused.)

1973
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,800
Did she go to jail or something?

1974
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:06,240
Why did you ask her
if she's doing well?

1975
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,810
(It looks like
she's quite far away.)

1976
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:09,910
Wait.

1977
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,010
Please continue.
Look at this camera.

1978
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,680
- Jail...
- I don't know if you're listening,

1979
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,250
but I like you so much.

1980
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,120
(I like you so much.)

1981
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,420
I wish you good luck.

1982
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,520
- It will turn out well.
- Okay.

1983
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,120
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1984
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,790
This is nice.

1985
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,190
It was funny
when he asked how she was.

1986
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:28,230
It's 7:20 p.m.

1987
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,460
Should we go back at 8:20 p.m.?

1988
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,770
- No. Let's get going now.
- Now?

1989
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:34,070
You slack off hard, don't you?

1990
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,410
I'll keep an eye on you
when you go on chores.

1991
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,870
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1992
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:42,010
(After eating and having fun,
evening came upon Ganghwa Island.)

1993
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,410
Have you been having fun, friend?

1994
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,550
- You're back.
- Hello.

1995
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,220
Go to the left. To the kitchen.

1996
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,780
You can put the ingredients
in the fridge.

1997
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,390
- We should.
- You're already here?

1998
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:52,820
Goodness.

1999
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,990
Don't take this wrong,
but show me the receipt.

2000
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:57,330
(He pretends not to hear.)

2001
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:58,390
Do you have a receipt?

2002
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:00,730
Let's not do that. We're so tired.

2003
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:04,300
(He takes a bite
of the twisted donut first.)

2004
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,070
- They bought snacks.
- What?

2005
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,170
I think they ate something.

2006
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:10,070
- They must have.
- It's for sure.

2007
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,570
I smell something.

2008
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,040
What smell?

2009
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,980
We even bought twisted donuts.

2010
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,180
Why are you lying down?

2011
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,150
- Why did you take so long?
- Why can't I?

2012
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:20,010
But...

2013
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,620
- Go work.
- I'm so tired.

2014
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:22,720
You should work.

2015
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:27,050
(Se Yoon escapes to the yard
away from the nagging.)

2016
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:30,020
The pork cutlet looked good.
We should eat that.

2017
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,530
People always want to grill meat
when they're out.

2018
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,990
(Workers need rest too.)

2019
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,000
(Should I lie down and rest
for a second?)

2020
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:37,260
Okay.

2021
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:38,670
What are you doing here?

2022
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:39,730
(The first son says a word.)

2023
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:41,740
Why aren't you working?

2024
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,000
What should I do for you?

2025
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,670
They will keep making us work there.

2026
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:47,540
(This was why Joon
didn't want to go back.)

2027
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:49,240
Let me know if you need anything.

2028
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,280
- Se Yoon.
- Yes?

2029
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,410
Please give me a massage.

2030
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:55,020
A massage?
Which bone do you want broken?

2031
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,220
Which one?

2032
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,290
Where do you want to feel pain?

2033
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:00,550
Just the shoulders.

2034
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,160
- You don't mind it being broken?
- Yes. The shoulders.

2035
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:05,490
(A K-massage shop is open.)

2036
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,060
I'm next.

2037
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,100
(Annoying)

2038
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,460
(Screaming)

2039
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:10,770
(Screaming)

2040
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:17,100
(A 0.1ton pressure massage)

2041
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,110
Se Yoon.

2042
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,910
Yes?

2043
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:24,650
I'd like a pineapple slushy.

2044
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,550
That's crazy.

2045
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:32,150
(Lee Joon, you punk...)

2046
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,560
(He sticks next to the master.)

2047
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,360
(It was 5 minutes ago.)

2048
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:41,900
I'll let you rest
if you tell me what you ate.

2049
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,670
We had one slushy.

2050
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:46,070
One slushy?

2051
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:47,670
A two-dollar slushy.

2052
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:50,000
(He confessed in the end
because of the offer.)

2053
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:54,040
(He told him about the taste
and the price.)

2054
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,480
It looked like they sold it
at a nearby store.

2055
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:01,150
(He's shocked
by his best friend Joon's betrayal.)

2056
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:03,120
(He can't say anything.)

2057
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,420
You'd know.

2058
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:07,250
You had a brain freeze
after drinking a pineapple slushy.

2059
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:10,520
(He punishes the betrayer.)

2060
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:12,730
Really? You...

2061
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:14,160
(There are lots of screams tonight
at the country vacation.)

2062
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,200
Who suddenly said that?

2063
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,930
Bring some of your poop later.

2064
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:20,400
I should check.

2065
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,440
(He needs his poop examined now.)

2066
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,540
This is really bad,

2067
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,240
but I really want to check...

2068
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,610
what they ate.

2069
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,010
- Se Yoon.
- Yes?

2070
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:32,350
Please sing us a song
while playing the guitar.

2071
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,550
It was really nice.

2072
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,150
Okay.

2073
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,980
(He has given up.)

2074
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:38,450
Music on!

2075
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:39,650
(The worker's dinner show is on.)

2076
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,020
(Instrument: Se Yoon,
Dance: Lee Joon)

2077
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,560
(A work that expresses
the sorrow of workers)

2078
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,560
It's a sad song.

2079
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,390
He's pretty good.

2080
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,000
He must've been
a great dancer in the past.

2081
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,530
(A great talent that has
experience with dancing)

2082
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,240
(The guitar rhythm
suddenly gets faster.)

2083
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,340
Great! Make it intense!

2084
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:03,280
(The past sorrow gets expressed
through this performance.)

2085
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:09,720
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2086
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:13,620
Se Yoon,
sing "Meeting" by KOYOTE for us.

2087
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,020
I'm sorry. I need to sleep.

2088
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:19,790
- I'm sorry.
- Just this once.

2089
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:21,460
- Sorry?
- Just this once.

2090
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:24,060
- I'm really tired.
- Just this once.

2091
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,070
KOYOTE's "Meeting"

2092
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:28,740
A new "Meeting"

2093
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,010
Gosh.

2094
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:33,910
(Was that a PSY song
or a KOYOTE song?)

2095
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,910
- That was good enough, right?
- Yes.

2096
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,510
That was "Meeting" by KOYOTE.

2097
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:38,910
- Okay.
- That was entertaining.

2098
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:40,250
(Everyone is satisfied
by the worker's talent show.)

2099
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,980
- Let's get some rest.
- Right.

2100
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,650
- Get some rest.
- Okay.

2101
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:48,360
(Se Yoon finally gets to lie down
for the first time.)

2102
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,790
- Everyone.
- What?

2103
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:51,230
Let's head out now.

2104
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,660
I just got to lie down.

2105
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,000
I just got to lie down.
Where do you want us to go?

2106
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,300
- Let's head out now.
- I just got to lie down.

2107
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,900
We have to move onto our next event.

2108
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,130
It seems like
you have rested up quite a bit.

2109
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:01,940
- Where are we going?
- Just out there.

2110
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,100
- We're leaving again?
- Yes.

2111
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,940
(Letting out a sigh)

2112
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:08,410
My gosh. This is...

2113
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:10,950
Why does it feel like
I'm doing things nonstop?

2114
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:11,950
(It feels like there's no end
to his work.)

2115
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:13,250
He wants us to head out.

2116
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,680
- Sae Ho.
- Head out? Let's go then.

2117
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,220
All right. I won.

2118
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,420
- Let's head out.
- Are you all here?

2119
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,290
- Be careful.
- Okay.

2120
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:21,790
Please stand together again.

2121
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,330
Can't we eat now?

2122
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:26,930
Se Yoon and Joon,

2123
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:29,160
you two have gone through a lot
as workers.

2124
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,260
- Right.
- Right.

2125
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,370
From now on,

2126
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:34,100
rank your own appearances.

2127
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:36,170
- What?
- Rank our own appearances?

2128
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:37,640
Get into a discussion...

2129
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:40,870
and decide on the ranks
of your appearances...

2130
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,180
- from 1st to 6th.
- Will this be okay?

2131
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,440
There's an obvious contender
for 6th place.

2132
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:46,350
What?

2133
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,450
(They all look the same way.)

2134
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:48,680
Including the workers?

2135
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,150
- All six including the workers.
- We're people too.

2136
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:53,790
Then let's decide on...

2137
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:55,490
the top ranks starting with
the person in first place.

2138
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:56,520
There are 2 at the top,
3 in the middle,

2139
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,560
and one at the bottom.

2140
01:10:58,230 --> 01:10:59,890
This is what I honestly think.

2141
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,000
- There are two at the top,
- Right.

2142
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,100
one in the middle,
and three at the bottom.

2143
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,330
Will you name the three
that are at the bottom?

2144
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,370
The three at the bottom?
I'm one of them.

2145
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:09,870
- Right.
- There's another one.

2146
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,370
- Right.
- There's another one after him.

2147
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,570
That other person is...

2148
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,070
The person who had
some good news recently.

2149
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,980
(Part of the 3 at the bottom)

2150
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,650
Joon looks handsome.

2151
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:20,780
Joon was at the center...

2152
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,820
- even when he was in MBLAQ.
- Right.

2153
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,150
- Joon has great looks.
- Okay.

2154
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:28,990
Seon Ho has a face
that is liked by...

2155
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:30,920
- the younger generation.
- Really?

2156
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,260
- Can I share my opinion?
- Sure.

2157
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,630
- These two are neck and neck.
- Right.

2158
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:37,000
These two are neck and neck.

2159
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,570
Let's think about these two later.

2160
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:40,370
Right. But I also think that...

2161
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,840
Jong Min's face
has melted down a lot.

2162
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,970
Why would you say that?

2163
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:47,940
- Gosh.
- How could my face melt down?

2164
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:50,240
- Take a look at us.
- Hey!

2165
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,780
- Stand together.
- Move away.

2166
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:55,250
- Gosh.
- Don't laugh!

2167
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:58,490
I just like making others laugh.
I don't have an ugly face.

2168
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:00,720
Why does Se Yoon
look really handsome to me today?

2169
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,060
- Come on.
- But...

2170
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,630
when Se Yoon
played the guitar earlier,

2171
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:06,460
- He's charming.
- I thought that...

2172
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:07,860
- he looked great.
- He's someone that's likable.

2173
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,830
I have a camera with me.

2174
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:11,570
- Let's take ID pictures.
- Right.

2175
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:13,230
- Let's compare them.
- Let's do that.

2176
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:14,370
(Comparing their faces
with ID pictures)

2177
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:16,070
I joined KOYOTE with my appearance.

2178
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,370
His face has melted down.

2179
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,670
Take it like a pictorial.

2180
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:21,240
- I decided on the one that's last.
- What's with his eyes?

2181
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,380
(Candidate 3, Moon Se Yoon)

2182
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,340
All right.
Let's take a look at them now.

2183
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,410
- Right.
- Se Yoon.

2184
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:26,650
Se Yoon looks handsome.

2185
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:28,380
- This is Se Yoon.
- What are you saying?

2186
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:30,520
Let's take a look at Jong Min next.

2187
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:33,320
Come on. I look different, don't I?

2188
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,660
- This is driving me crazy.
- He does look different.

2189
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,190
- Come on.
- There was one with me smiling.

2190
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:38,730
He's a comedian.
I'm the face of my group.

2191
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:39,930
(They check Sae Ho's picture
this time.)

2192
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,300
I told you!

2193
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,900
- What is it?
- Gosh!

2194
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,830
Sae Ho is really ugly.

2195
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:46,070
(His magazine face
has appeared again.)

2196
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,330
The person in last place
has been decided.

2197
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:48,600
It's neck and neck between
4th and 5th place.

2198
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,000
I'm in last place?

2199
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:52,610
- What? I didn't say anything.
- He's just...

2200
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:54,480
(Feeling bitter)

2201
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,840
- But...
- Things have gone completely wrong.

2202
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:57,750
- Joon should just step away.
- Okay.

2203
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:58,980
- Step away.
- I'm in first place?

2204
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:00,810
- First place, stay right there.
- Gosh.

2205
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:01,820
- Are you serious?
- Be honest...

2206
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:02,850
and raise your hand if you think
you are in second place.

2207
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,180
I'll be honest.

2208
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:05,720
Raise your hand if you think
you are in second place.

2209
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,820
Your face? What's wrong with him?

2210
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,720
- Raise your hand for second place.
- Gosh!

2211
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,860
- Gosh.
- You can step away...

2212
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,990
- if you get a majority vote.
- I can't believe this.

2213
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:14,290
Raise your hand if you think
Seon Ho is in second place.

2214
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:15,560
One, two, three.

2215
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,230
He looks better than DinDin.

2216
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,530
- Step away with second place.
- Right.

2217
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:21,640
- We will vote too.
- All right.

2218
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,340
Raise your hand
if you think you are in third place.

2219
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:24,570
- All right.
- Just stop.

2220
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:25,870
- Get back here.
- Get back here.

2221
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:26,940
- Just stop!
- Get back here.

2222
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:29,310
- Look at his mouth!
- Get back here.

2223
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:31,010
I look amazing in person.

2224
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,980
- I'm serious.
- Who said that?

2225
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:35,620
This is the response I get
from people when I walk around.

2226
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,620
- "What?"
- Show us your most confident look.

2227
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,090
But that's true about DinDin.

2228
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:41,260
He doesn't look bad.

2229
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:43,790
People get surprised
to see him with his great looks.

2230
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:46,860
When they ask if he's DinDin,
he goes, "Hello!"

2231
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:48,860
(Feeling annoyed)

2232
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,960
There's one part about you
that's disappointing.

2233
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:51,970
Where?

2234
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,230
Your nose looks really entertaining.

2235
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:55,940
Gosh! I admit it.

2236
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:57,400
I heard that a lot.

2237
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,040
They said I had a nose
that looked like a frog.

2238
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,910
They said it looked like a frog
that was about to jump.

2239
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:03,180
- Right.
- He looked handsome in the past.

2240
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,880
- A frog?
- He looked handsome.

2241
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,480
- A frog that was about to jump?
- Right.

2242
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:08,420
Step away as third place.

2243
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:10,450
That's hilarious.

2244
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:11,820
It's raining so let's hurry up
with the votes.

2245
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:12,820
Raise your hand if you think
you are in fourth place.

2246
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,920
- One, two, three.
- Let's be serious now.

2247
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,320
Raise your hand for Jong Min.
One, two, three.

2248
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,060
Se Yoon, show us your handsome face.

2249
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,730
(Irregular faces will be seen
on the screen for a while.)

2250
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:24,460
(Please be understanding.)

2251
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:26,870
Why do you keep doing this?

2252
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:28,040
I'm trying to cover my nose.

2253
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,340
Raise your hand for Jong Min.
One, two, three.

2254
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,610
I still think Jong Min
looks better than them.

2255
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:32,670
- He only got two votes.
- Yes.

2256
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:34,210
I vote for myself too!
What are you talking about?

2257
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:35,540
- So that's 3 votes. All right.
- That's 3 votes.

2258
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:36,940
- It'll be the same.
- Sae Ho in fourth place.

2259
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:37,950
One, two, three.

2260
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:39,510
(He just gets his own vote.)

2261
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:41,010
Se Yoon in fourth place.
One, two, three.

2262
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:43,180
- I vote for Se Yoon.
- It's over anyway.

2263
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,250
- Fine.
- You saw when I raised my hand, no?

2264
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:46,890
- All right.
- You were just a bit unlucky.

2265
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:48,090
- I'm fine.
- All right then.

2266
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,720
These are the ranks
of your own appearances.

2267
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:51,630
- All right.
- What?

2268
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:54,560
The most good-looking member
will go inside now.

2269
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,630
- What?
- What?

2270
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,530
- What?
- Am I free from being a worker?

2271
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,530
Really?

2272
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:59,770
You can go inside.

2273
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,300
It's raining a little right now,

2274
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,470
- so you should move back.
- What?

2275
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:04,340
Being in sixth place
is upsetting enough. What is this?

2276
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,340
(Joon enters the front yard
of the base camp.)

2277
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,410
I won't be a worker anymore!

2278
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:12,380
(He gets invited to the kitchen.)

2279
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:13,910
Hello, Joon.

2280
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:17,250
We will now begin the Dinner Game.

2281
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,050
Today's Dinner Game is called...

2282
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:22,160
Read the Room and Set the Table.

2283
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:24,260
Did you figure out
how the game works?

2284
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:25,830
No.

2285
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:28,000
Out of the ingredients
that are in front of you,

2286
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:30,300
you can leave after selecting one.

2287
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,900
When more than two people
choose the same ingredient,

2288
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:36,070
that ingredient will be taken back.

2289
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,270
Think about one ingredient...

2290
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:39,340
(The same ingredient
cannot be chosen between them.)

2291
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,010
you wish to choose.

2292
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,440
You may leave after that.

2293
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,540
This is tough.

2294
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,410
We worked hard to buy these.

2295
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:51,850
(Feeling anxious)

2296
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:54,190
Did you make your decision?

2297
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,060
I don't think anyone
will choose this one.

2298
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:57,260
- I'll go with this one.
- Okay.

2299
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,560
- You have chosen seafood.
- Right.

2300
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:02,000
Head outside through this way...

2301
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,560
- and wait. Yes.
- Do I bring it with me?

2302
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,800
(The members that have chosen
get moved inside.)

2303
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:07,230
Please close the door.

2304
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,000
(Sniffing)

2305
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:14,010
(These people are quite hungry.)

2306
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,640
I tasted it, and it was really good.

2307
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,750
I think going in first could be bad.

2308
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,080
- Right.
- That could be true.

2309
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,720
To be honest, Jong Min
would place first if he were young.

2310
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,350
It would be hard to beat Jong Min
if he were young.

2311
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:26,720
- Jong Min was really handsome.
- Jong Min would've placed first.

2312
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,890
- Right.
- This shows...

2313
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:30,090
how much you can drop down
if you don't take care of yourself.

2314
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,330
What do you mean I've dropped down?

2315
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:33,260
He was really handsome
when he was young.

2316
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:36,200
The nose that looks like a frog
about to jump is really funny.

2317
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,500
- Let's see it.
- A frog about to jump.

2318
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,500
Here.

2319
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,070
Who came up with that one?

2320
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:44,140
- Tae Hyun kept saying that.
- Really?

2321
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,640
I think it will jump
if I press it like this.

2322
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,110
It looks exactly like a frog.

2323
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,180
- Seon Ho, please head inside,
- What?

2324
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:51,280
I'll scream inside...

2325
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,450
- if it's something weird.
- Okay.

2326
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:53,750
- Check how it is inside.
- Okay.

2327
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,120
Something feels off.

2328
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,890
(Seon Ho heads into the kitchen
as well.)

2329
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,790
So I have to choose something...

2330
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:02,360
- that Joon hasn't chosen.
- Right.

2331
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,590
All right. Is Joon over there?

2332
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:06,130
Let's think about Joon...

2333
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,660
from what I know about him.

2334
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
He is someone who finds protein
to be very important.

2335
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,800
I think Joon
would have chosen pork belly.

2336
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:16,100
But he might've
made a drastic change...

2337
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:20,110
and went with budae stew.
That thought fills up my head.

2338
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,080
I don't think anyone
will choose this one.

2339
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,440
(I don't think anyone
will choose the seafood.)

2340
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:28,080
(He will end up choosing
the same one as Joon at this rate!)

2341
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:30,520
I like this one better
than these two.

2342
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:34,020
(Seon Ho went with seafood.)

2343
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:36,260
Why didn't you go
with what you would've chosen?

2344
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:38,990
You should've chosen pork belly.

2345
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:40,460
Why must I choose pork belly?

2346
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:44,000
Why did you choose that one?

2347
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,730
I've never made it obvious
about pork belly.

2348
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:49,300
You always talked about
the importance of protein.

2349
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,810
- I was talking about carbs!
- Please keep your voices down.

2350
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:53,310
We can't even fight?

2351
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:55,240
You should've chosen pork belly!

2352
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,680
Why did you choose this?

2353
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,380
- Why did you choose this?
- What about you?

2354
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:00,250
- Because I like this.
- I like it too.

2355
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:02,020
- All right. From now on...
- Pork belly...

2356
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:04,990
Please be quiet, Seon Ho and Joon.

2357
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:06,520
- This is much better!
- I love this.

2358
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,850
I love this more too.

2359
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:10,020
Do not say a word from now on.

2360
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:11,120
Fight without making any sounds
with your mouths.

2361
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,530
We need to fight right now.

2362
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:15,260
Really? I think this will be
a good scene for the show.

2363
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:16,300
They can hear you from inside.

2364
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,760
DinDin is in third place, right?

2365
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:19,370
Yes.

2366
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:21,300
The good-looking ones
will head inside first.

2367
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,970
Sure. See what it's like inside.

2368
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:30,480
Why is he being so annoying?

2369
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,080
- Gosh.
- He thinks he's good-looking?

2370
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:34,710
What is this?

2371
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:37,020
Did you figure it out?

2372
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,620
(This has nothing to do with looks.)

2373
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:42,120
Choose an ingredient
and head outside.

2374
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,290
(He must not choose
what the other members have chosen.)

2375
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,390
Gosh, this is hard.

2376
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,160
(Opening)

2377
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:50,330
(Is it seafood again?)

2378
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:53,100
No way. Don't be like that.

2379
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,300
What did you choose?

2380
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,440
Thank goodness.

2381
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,670
(DinDin chose rice.)

2382
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:57,740
DinDin.

2383
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:01,410
- I thought he'd choose pork belly.
- I don't have any thoughts.

2384
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,340
- Everyone.
- Yes.

2385
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,350
Do you know what this is about?

2386
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:07,280
- Not at all.
- No. What are we doing?

2387
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,720
You guys are...

2388
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:11,350
playing Dinner Game now.

2389
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:12,890
What are we doing?

2390
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:14,250
Then why...

2391
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,690
We don't get to eat?

2392
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:16,690
(Laughing)

2393
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:18,790
- What?
- I won't be eating?

2394
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,390
I...

2395
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:22,660
I bought pen shells.

2396
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,730
And I got scallops.

2397
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:27,170
I had to rack my head at the market.

2398
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:29,700
I bought them
while imagining delicious food.

2399
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,440
- What is this?
- What is this?

2400
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,770
I'm hungry.

2401
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,180
I have no idea what this is about.

2402
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:37,840
Try to guess what you are doing now.

2403
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,280
- Guess?
- I believe it will help.

2404
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,520
So, is this a team game?

2405
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,980
(He remains silent
when he's asked questions.)

2406
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:44,990
I guess not.

2407
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:46,290
I have no idea.

2408
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:47,690
(I have no idea.)

2409
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,420
Jong Min, you should go.

2410
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:50,860
- Okay.
- What's going on?

2411
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:52,030
I guess I get to eat.

2412
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:54,630
(He understood the mission.)

2413
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:56,600
(Surprisingly, he goes
through the bag of vegetables.)

2414
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,300
The vegetables... Hang on.

2415
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,930
I don't think they will eat this
even if I take it.

2416
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:03,470
I will make a bold choice.

2417
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,140
If we keep going like this,

2418
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,440
- we won't get pork belly.
- I know.

2419
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,780
(Kim Frog Nose makes
a creaking entrance.)

2420
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:14,450
I'm sure Jong Min picked ramyeon.

2421
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:18,720
- I was right.
- Jong Min always picks ramyeon.

2422
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:19,950
That's the rule.

2423
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:20,990
- Jong Min picks ramyeon.
- Right.

2424
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:23,560
- I knew he'd pick this.
- And Se Yoon will pick kimchi.

2425
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:25,830
- Se Yoon will get kimchi for sure.
- Listen.

2426
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:27,590
Hang on. If...

2427
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:28,730
(Hang on a second.)

2428
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,100
If Sae Ho picks rice...

2429
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:33,170
and Se Yoon picks this,

2430
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:35,270
- we won't get to eat anything?
- You can't eat.

2431
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:36,600
What kind of game is that?

2432
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,910
Do we have to starve?

2433
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:41,980
We should've eaten
200 dollars worth of twisted donuts.

2434
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:43,010
You're right.

2435
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,040
(They reflect on themselves
right away.)

2436
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,180
We should've bought
200 dollars worth of twisted donuts.

2437
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,620
If they pick the wrong one...
We have an ax here.

2438
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:50,520
(We have an ax here!)

2439
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,150
- Is this the Dinner Game?
- Yes.

2440
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:55,090
- Director Joo.
- Yes.

2441
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:56,260
In a situation like this,

2442
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:58,360
when you say, "Can you guess,"

2443
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:00,030
is there anyone who says yes?

2444
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,530
I'm really curious. What about you?

2445
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:04,500
- Let's say if there's...
- We were just sitting still.

2446
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,800
(He finally realizes
how Director Joo makes a fool of them.)

2447
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,970
He looks at us
as if we are really stupid.

2448
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:09,670
"Can't you still guess what it is?"

2449
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:12,270
That makes me lose my self-esteem.

2450
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:13,670
- This is...
- Why are you doing this?

2451
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:15,180
You just let us
rank our appearances...

2452
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:16,940
and told us to go in.
Then you ask us if we can guess.

2453
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:20,350
How would we even guess?
Does it have to be like a gamble?

2454
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,420
He just looked at us
as if we were pathetic.

2455
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,950
How would we even make a guess?

2456
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:28,260
If there is a disadvantage
depending on the ranking,

2457
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,890
- that's just wrong.
- It's bad. It's horrible.

2458
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,490
Please go in.

2459
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,030
Good luck.

2460
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:37,400
Among the ingredients
in front of you,

2461
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,370
choose one and head outside.

2462
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:41,870
I can't think of anything.
This is driving me crazy.

2463
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,740
If the ingredients overlap,
do we have to return them?

2464
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,340
Do I have to choose what I want?

2465
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:49,980
(He touches the kimchi right away.)

2466
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:52,150
By the way, why is it deflated?

2467
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:55,020
What's this? Who touched my kimchi?

2468
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:56,980
- It's deflated.
- We didn't touch it.

2469
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:58,250
- I know you did.
- We didn't.

2470
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,720
It's supposed to be full of air.
Who touched it?

2471
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,720
Be honest. You saw it, right?

2472
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:03,120
Did you take some?

2473
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:04,620
This is...

2474
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:07,360
This looks totally different.

2475
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:09,930
Are you messing with me?
What are you doing?

2476
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,100
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2477
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:14,500
Hang on.

2478
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,740
Hang on.

2479
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:19,010
Hang on.

2480
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:22,740
(Se Yoon's eyes change.)

2481
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,310
If my guess is right,

2482
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:27,180
the 1st person
would've taken number 1.

2483
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,450
The 2nd person took number 2.

2484
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:31,520
And the 3rd person took number 3.

2485
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:33,890
If they took things
in order like that,

2486
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:35,620
we would get to eat the whole thing.

2487
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:36,620
(Taking the ingredients
in the order of entry)

2488
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,720
(The same number of members
has to come out.)

2489
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,960
One, two, three.

2490
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,700
(During the Read the Room and Escape
in Uljin)

2491
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,730
It's easy. Those on the second floor
should stay inside.

2492
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:45,330
(They came up with the strategy
where they went out in order.)

2493
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:47,230
(Only those
in Rooms 1, 2, and 3 went out.)

2494
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:50,440
- Why did you come out?
- You shouldn't come out.

2495
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:51,870
- Is everyone out?
- This is... My gosh.

2496
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:53,770
(Se Yoon was the only one
who didn't figure it out...)

2497
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:55,040
(and got scolded severely.)

2498
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,510
(Read the room.)

2499
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:57,880
I'm also a member.

2500
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:59,150
(Laughing)

2501
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:03,580
During Read the Room and Escape,
I didn't understand the rules.

2502
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,620
I believe them.
We have been trained.

2503
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:07,790
I should trust them
and do as we were trained.

2504
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:10,960
That's what I should do.

2505
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:14,830
Should I go out now?
Please, my members... Please.

2506
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,960
We had to calculate everything...

2507
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,430
to buy all this.

2508
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:19,470
(Guys, I did it!)

2509
01:23:19,470 --> 01:23:22,000
(He spots the rice
in DinDin's hands.)

2510
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,940
- Really?
- We know what you chose.

2511
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:26,510
He's holding it with one hand.

2512
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:28,310
- That means it's rice or...
- It's kimchi.

2513
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:29,710
- Pork belly.
- It must be 1 of the 3.

2514
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:30,880
Is he holding pork belly vertically?

2515
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:33,810
- Is he holding it vertically?
- Hey! You fools.

2516
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:36,880
The 1st person should pick number 1.

2517
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:38,720
- My goodness.
- I picked number five.

2518
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:40,950
We have to return the rice?

2519
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:42,820
What are we going to eat?

2520
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:46,530
Hey, this is
what we practiced all the time.

2521
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:47,660
You're right.

2522
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:49,030
You fool.

2523
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:51,660
We should've taken things
in order... What's this?

2524
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:54,070
We should've picked them
in order. You fools.

2525
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,740
- My goodness.
- What did you do?

2526
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,370
This is crazy.

2527
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:58,440
(They scolded me
so harshly the other day.)

2528
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,770
Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6!

2529
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:04,140
You scolded me on the balcony.

2530
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:07,280
- My goodness.
- We will just eat budae stew.

2531
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:08,580
Unbelievable.

2532
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,620
- If Sae Ho picks this...
- If he does, it will be over.

2533
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:12,190
My gosh. What do we do?

2534
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:13,420
We will have to skip dinner.

2535
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,950
But Sae Ho is now...

2536
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,660
If he's the ugliest one
and doesn't get to eat,

2537
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,190
he will be really upset.

2538
01:24:18,730 --> 01:24:20,330
Why did we take a vote?

2539
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:22,630
- I know. To begin with...
- We could've done it randomly.

2540
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:25,870
Please.
If Sae Ho picks pork belly here,

2541
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:27,670
- we can eat this with pork belly.
- That would be nice.

2542
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:32,610
(Will Sae Ho be able
to become a hero?)

2543
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:36,040
(He understood the mission.)

2544
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:39,650
I'll rule a few things out first.

2545
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:40,910
- Okay.
- The thing...

2546
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:44,080
I don't have to eat tonight is...

2547
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:46,550
- This would be it.
- You will leave it out.

2548
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:47,720
I'll leave this out.

2549
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:49,390
And this too.

2550
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:50,420
- Rice too?
- Yes.

2551
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,060
It's hard to tell what Joon chose.

2552
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:57,130
Joon could've been simple
and picked pork belly.

2553
01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:00,730
Seon Ho would never choose seafood.

2554
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:04,440
He recently caught norovirus,
so he can't eat seafood.

2555
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:07,610
They said they wanted to eat this.

2556
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:08,640
(All his guesses are wrong.)

2557
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,710
(What's his final choice?)

2558
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:12,450
Sae Ho is coming. He's out.

2559
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:13,510
Don't look.

2560
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:14,980
- Sae Ho.
- Yes.

2561
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,220
- Did you choose one?
- Yes.

2562
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,920
Just tell us this.
Is it 1 of numbers 1, 2, and 3?

2563
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,050
Or is it 1 of numbers 4, 5, and 6?

2564
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,650
- It's 1 of numbers 1, 2, and 3.
- What?

2565
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:22,090
(It's either pork belly,
budae stew, or kimchi.)

2566
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:23,260
Walk over here.

2567
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,720
This is bad.

2568
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:27,030
You can be a star here.

2569
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:28,500
Please.

2570
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:29,560
(It's a chance for him
to become our star!)

2571
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,300
I wish my guess was right.

2572
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,300
Please.

2573
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:35,370
One, two, three.

2574
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:36,400
Pork belly!

2575
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:37,770
Three. Pork belly!

2576
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:40,210
(Sae Ho chose pork belly.)

2577
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:41,670
(Sae Ho did it.)

2578
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:43,880
- Sae Ho! You did it!
- My goodness.

2579
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,350
You're Cha Eun Woo.

2580
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:46,950
- My goodness.
- Cho Eun Woo.

2581
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:48,850
- I did a great job.
- Cho Eun Woo.

2582
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:50,020
Is it a good one?

2583
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,580
- You did well.
- I see.

2584
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,650
My goodness.

2585
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:53,720
This is the best.

2586
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,150
- It's perfect.
- It's amazing.

2587
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,790
I made a guess.

2588
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:57,990
- How?
- How?

2589
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:59,160
With telepathy,

2590
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,900
I thought you let the last member
to pick pork belly.

2591
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,030
- I see.
- So I chose pork belly.

2592
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:06,100
- Good job.
- I thought it would work.

2593
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,830
- You did a great job.
- Well done.

2594
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:09,500
- Really?
- It's good. It's all thanks to you.

2595
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,670
- You did a great job.
- Is this a joke?

2596
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:12,810
- No, we get to eat thanks to you.
- Really?

2597
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:14,170
This feels strange.

2598
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:15,240
(It feels strange
that you guys are praising me.)

2599
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,640
- Okay.
- All right, everyone.

2600
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,610
- I'm so relieved.
- You will eat...

2601
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:20,310
- pork belly and budae stew.
- Thank goodness.

2602
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:21,450
- Okay.
- Yes.

2603
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:22,880
- We got the good ones.
- They are the main dishes.

2604
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,620
- We are eating two main dishes.
- Right.

2605
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,450
We will clean the kitchen now.

2606
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:27,990
- Please wait a moment.
- Okay.

2607
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:29,320
Sae Ho saved us.

2608
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,590
- This feels good.
- You did a good job.

2609
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,390
Guys, let's eat.

2610
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:38,160
The budae stew doesn't have
vegetables in it.

2611
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,570
Anyway, we can make it
salty and spicy.

2612
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:42,440
And grill the meat...

2613
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,540
Why are we grilling the meat?

2614
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:45,710
- I'll do it.
- Joon will do it.

2615
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:47,040
We have workers here.

2616
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,340
- I saw a big pot in there.
- Okay.

2617
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:51,210
Bring it. We will use it
to cook ramyeon.

2618
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:52,210
Then we can grill meat.

2619
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:53,810
Don't tell us what you'll do.
Just do it.

2620
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:55,850
- Have a seat and wait.
- I was like,

2621
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:57,880
"Why is he telling us what to do?"

2622
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,620
- I know.
- This is nice.

2623
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:02,020
Come to think of it...
Have some chat while you wait.

2624
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,020
- My gosh.
- Why did you bring seafood?

2625
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:05,660
- The workers... Gosh.
- Okay.

2626
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:07,390
All right. Shall we begin?

2627
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:08,660
(The workers start cooking.)

2628
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:11,100
For the past four years,

2629
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,700
I've never been so relaxed
during our trips.

2630
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:13,930
- Is it your first time?
- Yes.

2631
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:17,000
- It's strange because I'm relaxed.
- I know.

2632
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,270
Even when things were easy,

2633
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,140
we always had at least one issue.

2634
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:23,340
- But we don't have any now.
- I bet there will be one tomorrow.

2635
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:25,140
This is just nice.

2636
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:27,410
Sae Ho hurt his leg.

2637
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,410
Right.

2638
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,620
Things should be easy
until Sae Ho is fully recovered.

2639
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,420
Sae Ho, you said
it would take about two years.

2640
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:33,890
- Three years.
- Right.

2641
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:36,260
- Including rehabilitation...
- It takes a long time.

2642
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,830
It will take three years until
I can do the One-legged Fight again.

2643
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:40,890
- One-legged Fight?
- And two years until jegichagi.

2644
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,730
If it's that bad,
you should quit this show.

2645
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:44,860
(He should quit the show then.)

2646
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:46,200
Let's wait and see.

2647
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,270
- If it turns out...
- Wait and see?

2648
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:49,970
that I can't do it,
I'll write a letter...

2649
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:52,270
and leave the show.

2650
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,110
Should we go and take a look?

2651
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:55,810
I'll just go and check things.

2652
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:57,310
I want to see.

2653
01:27:57,310 --> 01:28:00,680
I'll see
if there's anything I can eat.

2654
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:02,980
- We will grill the pork belly.
- Let me help.

2655
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,480
I think it will take a long time.

2656
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,590
- No.
- You can cook the meat there.

2657
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:07,650
Where?

2658
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:08,920
What? No, you can't eat it.

2659
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,260
I need to taste it.

2660
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:11,920
- No.
- Why not?

2661
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:13,960
- I can grill meat well.
- It's raw.

2662
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,630
- Is it okay to eat it raw?
- Yes.

2663
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,500
(DinDin also achieved his goal.)

2664
01:28:19,530 --> 01:28:20,700
Do you want me to cook pork belly?

2665
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:23,070
- I'll do it. We can do it together.
- Okay.

2666
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:24,540
I'm good at this.

2667
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:26,770
The color looks nice.

2668
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:28,680
- Turn on the stove.
- Turn it on?

2669
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:31,380
You do it.

2670
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:33,250
- Why? Because it's dangerous?
- Yes.

2671
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:34,450
(Kim Scaredy-cat is scared.)

2672
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,980
If it's dangerous, we all will
die together when it bursts.

2673
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:38,020
- Really?
- Yes.

2674
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:40,090
- But I'm right in front of it.
- I'll do it.

2675
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:41,690
Right. It's more dangerous.

2676
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:43,790
Isn't this how you turn it on?

2677
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:45,260
No. Hang on.

2678
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:47,190
- Is it open?
- You should open it.

2679
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:49,800
Let me do it. I'll do it for you.
It says "open."

2680
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,170
(Keeping his distance)

2681
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:56,240
You must open it some more.

2682
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,640
This is so annoying.

2683
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:58,640
(DinDin has to finish up.)

2684
01:28:58,640 --> 01:28:59,740
That's it.

2685
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:02,040
- It's hot.
- What are you doing?

2686
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:04,810
(These two aren't much help.)

2687
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:06,010
Did you clean this?

2688
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:08,980
(Cooking begins in earnest.)

2689
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,520
Wipe it with some grease.

2690
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,990
(They grease the pan first.)

2691
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:15,150
(Sizzling)

2692
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:16,820
- What nice pork belly.
- Sae Ho.

2693
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:18,060
How many does this serve?

2694
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,960
- This is enough for nine.
- Sounds good.

2695
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,630
One strip is one portion.

2696
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,160
Shall I sprinkle some black pepper?

2697
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,500
- Yes.
- Salt and pepper.

2698
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:28,900
That's it. Lovely.

2699
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,370
It looks great.

2700
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:32,310
I think that's about enough.

2701
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:33,770
- Yes.
- Black pepper is nice.

2702
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:37,310
- Leave some for the other side.
- It looks so good.

2703
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:41,980
- My gosh.
- Look at this.

2704
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:44,350
Just look at the color.

2705
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:46,050
- Gosh.
- It's amazing.

2706
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:48,720
- Sae Ho did us good today.
- Yes.

2707
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,260
We wouldn't have this
if not for him.

2708
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,320
Sae Ho did great.

2709
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,730
I think we chose well.

2710
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,290
Keep it rough and simple.

2711
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,330
There's no need to make it fancy.

2712
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,330
This is just...

2713
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:02,200
(He starts with ham,
the main ingredient.)

2714
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:04,940
(Shaking it out expertly)

2715
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:08,240
(Meticulous slicing)

2716
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:11,040
(Chef Moon doesn't disappoint.)

2717
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:13,810
What do you need me to do?

2718
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:16,950
- Shall we make the base?
- Shall we?

2719
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:18,050
That's done.

2720
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,220
(Estimating the amount of soy sauce)

2721
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:21,850
(Estimating the amount of gochujang)

2722
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,590
We don't have kimchi,
so we need the secret sauce.

2723
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:27,430
(MSG is added.)

2724
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,500
(And some ramyeon powder too.)

2725
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:34,400
(Mix it well.)

2726
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,370
(Mix the sauce base
into beef bone broth.)

2727
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:38,500
It looks good.

2728
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:41,610
- You think so?
- It'll be good enough.

2729
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:43,480
We have only a few ingredients.

2730
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:46,710
It'll taste good
with what little we have.

2731
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:49,950
Let's slice it and fry it.

2732
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:52,390
- We have to cut it.
- Cut it up.

2733
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:54,050
(They cut it to cook it thoroughly.)

2734
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:58,120
It sounds fantastic.

2735
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,260
(Full of juice)

2736
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:00,730
Can I taste this piece?

2737
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:02,300
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

2738
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:05,770
It's incredible. This is great.

2739
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:07,400
- Let's all have a piece.
- Yes.

2740
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:09,670
- Me too. I want a taste.
- Have this piece.

2741
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,610
- Eat one.
- The oil is splashing.

2742
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,040
Can I eat it as is?

2743
01:31:15,410 --> 01:31:16,480
My gosh.

2744
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:22,180
My gosh.

2745
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,880
(What's this noise?)

2746
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:26,420
Are you starting first?

2747
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:29,020
(Next episode)

2748
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:31,620
(A romantic countryside barbecue)

2749
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:34,030
(Are you starting first?)

2750
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:36,600
(Explosive nagging)

2751
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:39,430
(It's not easy being a worker.)

2752
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:42,170
(Whining)

2753
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:45,170
(At last, it's time...)

2754
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:46,870
(to change their status.)

2755
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:48,510
- Hurry up.
- It's close.

2756
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:49,880
(Let your guard down,)

2757
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,110
(and you become a worker.)

2758
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:52,110
Now it's dangerous.

2759
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:53,510
(Please!)

2760
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:55,510
(Anyone but me!)

2761
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,450
(The surface wobbles.)

2762
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:04,660
(Who will be the new worker?)
