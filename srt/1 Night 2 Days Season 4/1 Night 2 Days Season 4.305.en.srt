00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:03,096
(Clear waves...)

2
00:00:03,097 --> 00:00:05,567
(and a peaceful seaside view)

3
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:07,366
(This trip begins in Sacheon.)

4
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:10,336
Look at the sea, guys. Look at it.

5
00:00:10,337 --> 00:00:12,047
(This trip begins in Sacheon.)

6
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:13,947
It looks amazing.

7
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:15,647
It's a grand sight.

8
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:18,616
This year's Entertainment Awards is over.

9
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:20,146
- Se Yoon.
- Congratulations, guys.

10
00:00:20,147 --> 00:00:21,917
- For what?
- Congratulations.

11
00:00:22,117 --> 00:00:23,156
- For what?
- Jong Min.

12
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,957
You danced "Soda Pop" so well.

13
00:00:25,387 --> 00:00:26,826
"My little soda pop."

14
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,633
(Jong Min will perform at the Entertainment Awards.)

15
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:32,026
(They're teasing him over something that hasn't happened yet.)

16
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:33,066
Hello.

17
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,796
- Hello.
- They're talking nonsense.

18
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:35,866
Hello, everyone.

19
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:37,066
"Talk of the town."

20
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,467
"Jong Min's 'Soda Babo.'"

21
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:40,536
I really liked the performance.

22
00:00:40,537 --> 00:00:42,676
You're really amazing.

23
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:44,036
It was tough.

24
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:45,276
I still feel the excitement.

25
00:00:45,277 --> 00:00:46,877
Can you dance for us again?

26
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:50,247
- One, two.
- One, two, three, four.

27
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,086
(He hasn't learned the choreography yet...)

28
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,063
(as it's two weeks before the Entertainment Awards.)

29
00:00:56,087 --> 00:01:00,757
(He smashed it yesterday.)

30
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:03,057
- Se Yoon, you were the host.
- Se Yoon.

31
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:04,927
"Hello, dear viewers."

32
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:06,166
Not bad.

33
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,597
The 2025 KBS Entertainment Awards.

34
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:10,866
Who will win the Grand Award?

35
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:12,237
Would you like to know?

36
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,466
- You sound like him.
- I like the tone.

37
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:15,476
(What a nice tone.)

38
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:17,606
This episode will air the day after...

39
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:18,967
- the Entertainment Awards.
- Yes.

40
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:21,606
- So I'll give you some information.
- What is it?

41
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:22,847
Kim Jong Min...

42
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:25,146
- He won't dance "Soda Pop?"
- is nominated for the Grand Award.

43
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:26,647
(Grand Award nominee Kim Jong Min)

44
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:28,586
(The members weren't aware yet.)

45
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:30,086
Of course he is, for "Soda Pop."

46
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:31,686
You've been nominated almost every year.

47
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:32,926
- Every year.
- Every year.

48
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,696
Was your last solo Grand Award win in 2016?

49
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:36,726
- Yes.
- Gosh.

50
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:38,496
You win every ten years.

51
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:40,177
- Really?
- The entertainment greats, yes.

52
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:46,007
(We're proud of our Celebrity of the Year.)

53
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,636
The Entertainment Awards is huge,

54
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:48,976
but I'm more interested in...

55
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:50,736
my colleague's new TV drama.

56
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:52,276
It's a realistic love story...

57
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:53,946
of a couple surrounding a rating.

58
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,976
- What's that?
- A rating?

59
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:56,176
A five-star guy...

60
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:59,046
ends up being matched with a one-star girl.

61
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:00,246
- Oh.
- It's like...

62
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:02,316
People get a star rating that ranges from 1 to 5.

63
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:03,856
- Really?
- I'm worth five stars.

64
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,886
I don't look like it, right?

65
00:02:04,887 --> 00:02:06,627
- But I got a five-star rating.
- Do you...

66
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:08,526
stutter in that drama like you do here?

67
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:09,856
No, I don't ever stutter there.

68
00:02:09,857 --> 00:02:11,356
- It's because it's cold.
- Is that it?

69
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:14,567
I stutter more and more on 2 Days 1 Night.

70
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,267
Why is that? Do I get hyper?

71
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:19,506
I'm really eloquent in the drama.

72
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,837
You'll hear my perfect diction.

73
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:24,406
It will broadcast on the 24th.

74
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:26,106
- On Christmas Eve.
- Yes.

75
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:29,076
- We'll start today's trip.
- Okay.

76
00:02:29,077 --> 00:02:30,677
- Very well. In Sacheon.
- Yes.

77
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:33,616
You can walk along the Samcheonpo coast...

78
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:35,656
and enjoy the beautiful sunset...

79
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,616
on this Noeul Jeonmanggyo Bridge.

80
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:39,587
- Noeul Jeonmanggyo Bridge.
- It's famous.

81
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:43,157
Today, we'll follow the south coast of South Gyeongsang Province...

82
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:44,826
and visit Sacheon, Goseong,

83
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:46,826
as well as Namhae.

84
00:02:46,827 --> 00:02:48,226
- Goseong?
- Goseong?

85
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:49,667
We'll go to Namhae too?

86
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,767
There's something we must do at the end of each year.

87
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,006
- What?
- We must...

88
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,436
balance all the accounts.

89
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:56,636
- "Balance the accounts?"
- Yes.

90
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:59,277
- Account balancing...
- The theme of this trip is...

91
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:02,376
the Year-End Hardship Settlement Race.

92
00:03:02,377 --> 00:03:03,377
What's that?

93
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:04,946
For a whole year, you couldn't eat...

94
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:06,116
when you were hungry...

95
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:07,986
and you suffered to sleep outdoors...

96
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,586
- in the hot and cold.
- Yes.

97
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:12,057
- Are we repaid for that?
- Please repay us.

98
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:16,926
(Winter)

99
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:19,366

(And now it's winter again.)

103
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:27,736
(Getting left behind, hunger, diving, going topless, )

104
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:29,737
(on the road, getting wet, chases, races, fishing)

105
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:36,977
(Everyone had it tough on this...)

106
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:41,887
(hardcore variety show.)

107
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:45,387

(The 2025 Year-End Hardship Settlement Race)

109
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,127
The more you suffered,

110
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:54,226
the more you shined in the past year.

111
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:55,396
- What?
- Gosh...

112
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:57,267
For all your suffering,

113
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,806
- we'll settle the balance.
- For real?

114
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,237
- For real?
- Do we get something?

115
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:04,207
The most important part of a 2 Days 1 Night trip...

116
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:05,507
is the dinner...

117
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:08,676
and where you sleep and we did some counting.

118
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:09,876
- This is fun.
- Seriously?

119
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:11,416
- First...
- Gosh.

120
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,786
- Jong Min's first.
- Just the top one.

121
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:13,987
One, two, three.

- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

What's this?

127
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:29,266
I ate the least?

128
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,796
No, it's the number of fails.

129
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:32,197
- You ate well.
- Fails...

130
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:33,506
- A big number is bad.
- What?

131
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,166
- It's Se Yoon and me.
- Se Yoon didn't eat much.

132
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,576
Se Yoon and Seon Ho.

133
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,057
- What?
- I missed just five dinners?

134
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:40,676
DinDin. You had the best time.

135
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:41,776
What is this count?

136
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:44,177
DinDin had dinner on all but three trips.

137
00:04:44,447 --> 00:04:45,786
- Gosh.
- Hey, DinDin...

138
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,616
- You had a good life.
- Considering that,

139

- he's always the grumpiest.
- Yes.

"I'm starving!"

141
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,087
Push your front teeth back in. You ate the most.

142
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:54,487
- Look.
- It's not that.

143
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,227
Look at him sticking out his mouth.

144
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:57,696
- Why...
- What?

145
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,597
You couldn't eat because you did poorly.

146
00:04:59,797 --> 00:05:02,366
- No!
- Did you hear what he said?

147
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:03,496
We didn't do poorly.

148
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:05,196
We did our very best for two days...

149
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:06,366

- The next one.
- Let's see the other statistics.

goes to Jong Min. Congratulations.

Give him some applause.

170
00:05:48,877 --> 00:05:50,016
You came first.

171
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,897
- It was really tough.
- You sleep on the road.

172
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:54,016
- You slept outdoors half the time.
- It's that drastic?

00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:09,166
We'll add up the number of times...

180
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:10,866
you missed dinner and slept outdoors...

181
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:12,907
and give you a dollar per count.

182
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:15,167
(That's better than I expected.)

183
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,076
I should've done poorly!

184
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,977
I should've done really poorly!

185
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:21,407
- Here's your money.
- For real?

186
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:23,446
- Jong Min...
- Hey.

187
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:25,477
- I'll share with you.
- It has our names.

188
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:26,917
- Okay.
- Got it.

189
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:29,186
- I'm rich.
- What, 18 dollars?

190
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,417
I can eat well with that.

191
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,657
- Nine dollars?
- Yes.

192
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:34,727
My bad for doing well.

193
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:37,926
We did well considering it's a variety show.

194
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:39,066
- Yes.
- That's exciting.

195
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,566
(Current Balance, Jong Min: 18 dollars, )

196
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,126
(Se Yoon: 17 dollars, Joon: 16 dollars, Sae Ho: 12 dollars)

197
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:43,666
(Seon Ho: 11 dollars, DinDin: 9 dollars)

198
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:44,736
Okay, everyone.

199
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,106
You'll compete in 2 teams of 3.

200
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,107
Good!

201
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,076
Since we're settling the balance for your hardships,

202
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,477
at the end of this trip...

203
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:53,976
awaits a harsh penalty.

204
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:55,976
- It would be really harsh.
- No, wait.

205
00:06:55,977 --> 00:06:58,876
The penalty at the end of the day is always cruel.

206
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,086
- It's the worst.
- Yes.

207
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,187
- It can't be.
- No way.

208
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,917
You'll dive into the sea.

209
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:05,317
- You're insane.
- At night?

210
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:07,786
- When?
- Before nightfall.

211
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:09,497
(We dive in this weather?)

212
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:13,667
(The bitterly cold winter sea)

213
00:07:14,697 --> 00:07:17,897
(They must dive in in the cold of winter.)

214
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:19,106
It's...

215
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:20,107
(Oh...)

216
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:22,706
It's so cold even the fish don't come out nowadays.

217
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,876
- We can't...
- In a few years, Jong Min...

218
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,146
will be on "Incredible Moment..."

219
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:27,906
as an old man who dives.

220
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,647
- He's...
- Seriously.

221
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,846
"Every week for 18 years,"

222
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:33,846
"Mr. Kim has been diving into the sea."

223
00:07:33,847 --> 00:07:36,316
"It's not cold at all."

224
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:37,786
Are there any aftereffects?

225
00:07:37,787 --> 00:07:39,357
You've been diving for 18 years.

226
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:40,487
Are there any side effects?

227
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:42,557
- When I first joined the show, - Yes.

228
00:07:42,857 --> 00:07:44,396
They have to break the ice, so we could go into the water.

229
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,303
- They used to do that?
- Yes. They even broke the ice.

230
00:07:46,327 --> 00:07:47,327
I'll do my best!

231
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:48,996
(His reckless courage in his 20s got him to jump into the icy water.)

232
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:52,397
(His reckless courage in his 20s got him to jump into the icy water.)

233
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:54,777
I used to jump in without hesitation. At one point,

234
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:56,936
I wondered, "Am I going to be okay?"

235
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:58,613
- That crossed my mind.
- Things have changed.

236
00:07:58,637 --> 00:07:59,646
- Gosh, it will be so cold.
- It will be cold.

237
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,506
If that's our penalty, we must do our best.

238
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:03,147
- Seriously.
- Right. I really hate this.

239
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:05,847
Here's how you'll team up. Jong Min got the most money back.

240
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:08,686
The King of Struggle for 2025, Jong Min,

241
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:11,017
will randomly pick two members for his team.

242
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:13,286
Then teaming up with Jong Min is a good thing.

243
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:14,657
He's going to draw the names.

244
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:16,256
Personally, who do you want for your team?

245
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:17,757
- Based on the data, - Yes.

246
00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:19,597
- I want DinDin and Seon Ho.
- Okay.

247
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:20,926
Team YB.

248
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:22,166
Jong Min is strictly following...

249
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,436
- data.
- All right.

250
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:24,966
Of course. It's all about science.

251
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,937
- Jong Min.
- Science matters for TV shows too.

252
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,036
- Who's the winner?
- Jong Min, tell us.

253
00:08:30,037 --> 00:08:31,176
(Did he pick the member he wanted?)

254
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,206
Describe this member.

255
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,207
- On 2 Days 1 Night, he's...
- Go on.

256
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,887
- Is he the youngest?
- the best youngest. Seon Ho!

257
00:08:37,747 --> 00:08:38,877
- Gosh.
- Nice.

258
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:40,286
- Okay.
- You picked the member you wanted.

259
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,887
- This is good.
- We got this, Jong Min.

260
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:43,356
- I'll give it my all today.
- Yes.

261
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,456
- All right. It's Seon Ho.
- This is iffy.

262
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,556
- If you pick...
- Who will be next?

263
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:47,717
DinDin next, you will have gotten everyone you wanted.

264
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,596
- Right. If I pick DinDin...
- Yes.

265
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:50,857
Let's do this.

266
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:52,297
- All right.
- Okay.

267
00:08:52,727 --> 00:08:53,866
- He...
- Say something nice.

268
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,166
- will be the last member...
- Who is it?

269
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:58,636
- to join my team.
- The last spot. Okay.

270
00:08:58,637 --> 00:08:59,766
(Who is the second member to join Jong Min's team?)

271
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:01,487
He will star in a KBS single-episode drama.

272
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:03,377
It's Lee Joon.

273
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:04,777
- Okay.
- Go.

274
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:07,817
- Hold on.
- I have a good feeling about this.

275
00:09:07,877 --> 00:09:09,106
I have a good feeling about this.

276
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:10,346
Hey, you know what? Even if...

277
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:11,616
Joon isn't happy. Something doesn't feel right.

278
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,016
- I'll be good to you.
- Wait.

279
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:14,686
- We're just a group of fools.
- Gosh.

280
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,816
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- I'll be good.

281
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:17,116
Seon Ho, I'll be good to you.

284
00:09:19,757 --> 00:09:21,086
(Jong Min, Joon, Seon Ho: 45 dollars)

285
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:22,567
(Se Yoon, Sae Ho, DinDin: 38 dollars)

286
00:09:23,427 --> 00:09:25,097
Should we pick a name for our team?

287
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:27,873
Let's pick a name that has to do with the struggles we faced.

288
00:09:27,897 --> 00:09:28,926
(They head to the mission spot...)

289
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:30,313
(while thinking about the name for their team.)

290
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,566
(Cawing)

291
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:32,737
Gosh, the crow...

292
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,047
- It's bad luck. Why are there here?
- Gosh, what's going on?

293
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:37,736
This feels ominous.

294
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:39,347
(What kind of mission awaits them?)

295
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,967
- It's over there.
- I guess that's our mission spot.

296
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:44,347
I hope it's a quiz about the turtle ship.

297
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,747
Nice. Something's set up here.

298
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,263
- Are we doing the long jump?
- Gosh, this place...

299
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,386
- I hope it's the long jump.
- Long jump?

300
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:51,156
I don't think this has to do with our mission.

301
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,487
- The lines have been here?
- No.

302
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:54,126
- No, they set this up.
- It must be the long jump.

303
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,007
- It looks like it's the long jump.
- It's new.

304
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,796
- All right.
- The line looks fresh.

305
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:58,856
Okay.

306
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:01,027
By the way, did you pick a name for your team?

307
00:10:01,197 --> 00:10:03,136
- We went with a cute one.
- Okay.

308
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:04,796
DinDin gave us a simple idea.

309
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:06,037
Team No Pain No DinDin.

310
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:07,837
Only my name goes in.

311
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,406
- I was embarrassed...
- No.

312
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:10,506
- after suggesting it.
- No.

313
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:11,576
- It's fine. So what?
- What about us?

314
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,646
- We'll change it...
- Great.

315
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:13,706
- if we get a better one.
- Right.

316
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:15,276
- Team No Pain No DinDin.
- Team No Pain No DinDin.

317
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:16,317
Okay.

318
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:19,347
(Curious)

319
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,216
(Hesitant)

320
00:10:21,217 --> 00:10:22,817
How about Team Kim Jong Min?

321
00:10:23,217 --> 00:10:24,556
Kim Jong Min and the Boys.

322
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,156
- Okay.
- Let's go with Team Jong Min.

323
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:27,856
Team Kim Jong Min and Team No Pain No DinDin.

324
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:29,657
- Okay.
- Let's go with them.

325
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:31,856
I'll give you a chance to gain more money...

326
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,427
for your team before we begin.

327
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,566
Ten dollars are at stake on this.

328
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:37,236
- Ten dollars?
- That's a lot of money.

329
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,413
- Ten dollars.
- That's great.

330
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,606
Hare, Where Are You Going?

331
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,036
I guess we'll have to hop like a bunny.

332
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:43,306
Did you know that Sacheon of South Gyeongsang Province...

333
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:45,877
is the home of the famous story, "The Hare's Liver?"

334
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,377
- Really?
- I see.

335
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:48,647
- "The Hare's Liver."
- Yes.

336
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,046
Like the hare who tried to protect its liver...

337
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:52,517
from the turtle in the story,

338
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:54,917
you must protect your balloon.

339
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,757
The rules are similar to the rules of Green Light, Red Light.

340
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:01,327
You'll take turns to play offense and defense.

341
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:03,556
There are three players on Team Turtle.

342
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:04,996
- One of them is the Dragon King.
- Okay.

343
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,566
The Dragon King will be the tagger like in Green Light, Red Light.

344
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,203
Instead of saying, "green light, red light,"

345
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:10,367
he will say, "Hey, hare."

346
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:11,897
(Hey, hare!)

347
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:14,236
Meanwhile, the hares must move to ring the bell...

348
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:16,107
in front of the Dragon King.

349
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:18,636
(Everyone can move freely...)

350
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,237
(only when the Dragon King is speaking.)

351
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:23,117
(Otherwise, they can only move their upper body.)

352
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:29,387
(Protecting as many balloons as possible while on the move is key.)

353
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:31,656
If one of the hares rings the bell,

354
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,827
- you must run to the starting line.
- Okay.

355
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,656
(Any hares the Dragon King catches...)

356
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:37,326
(before the starting line will have failed the mission.)

357
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:39,496
The number of the balloons from the surviving hares...

358
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:42,057
will count toward their total number to decide the winning team.

359
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:44,737
Team Hare will get seven balloons.

360
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:47,437
You can divide them among yourselves.

361
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:48,637
Okay.

362
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:49,783
(Distributing them will be the first strategy.)

363
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:50,876
You can decide.

364
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,776
- Offense or defense?
- This is...

365
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:54,483
- Pick what you guys want now.
- Team Turtle?

366
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:56,246
- We'll be Team Turtle first.
- We'll be Team Turtle.

367
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:57,947
Everyone, grab a shell.

368
00:11:58,277 --> 00:11:59,517
Let's be a Ninja Turtle.

369
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:00,746
(They divide 7 balloons and attach them.)

370
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:01,817
You have to do a good job.

371
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:04,186
How can I not get caught?

372
00:12:04,187 --> 00:12:06,503
(Se Yoon: 3 balloons, Sae Ho: 2 balloons, DinDin: 2 balloons)

373
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,957
Se Yoon has three.

374
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:10,197
He's probably going to use his power.

375
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,097
He'll try to keep them. You know what I mean?

376
00:12:13,827 --> 00:12:15,567
Then you should be the Dragon King.

377
00:12:16,497 --> 00:12:18,996
- You guys need to protect me.
- Right. Then...

378
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:21,537
But you're fast enough to catch Se Yoon.

379
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,376
The turtles will come to catch you.

380
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:25,107
We need to be the bait.

381
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:30,117
(Their mind game is fierce with the hare's liver at stake.)

382
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:32,516
(The losing team will have a higher chance...)

383
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:34,017
(of going into the water.)

384
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,756
- Gosh.
- The black tapes are the spots...

385
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,817
for Team Turtle.

386
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,456
By the way, 2 Days 1 Night is a variety show.

387
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:43,496
- But they're so serious about this.
- No.

388
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,126
- Guys.
- They look...

389
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:46,727
(They're still discussing the tactic.)

390
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,367
I bet he'll ring it right after this part.

391
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:51,536
- If you hear a high note, - It's a variety show.

392
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,766
- just go for it.
- Okay.

393
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:53,767
Okay?

394
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:55,537
- They'll take this seriously.
- Right.

395
00:12:56,637 --> 00:12:58,506
Must we be this intense from the first game?

396
00:12:58,507 --> 00:12:59,577
Let's go.

397
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:01,777
All right. Are you ready?

398
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:03,216
Yes.

399
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,846
(The turtles must steal the hares' livers, the balloons.)

400
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:06,417
Get ready, set...

401
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,087
(Round 1 begins.)

402
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:12,386
(Hare DinDin quickly pushes forward.)

403
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:13,457
You're dead meat.

404
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:15,987
(Guarding DinDin up close)

405
00:13:16,457 --> 00:13:17,796
(The hare must go to the Dragon King while dodging the turtles.)

406
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,373
(Sae Ho, Se Yoon, DinDin, Joon, Jong Min, Seon Ho)

407
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:21,727
(But his path is completely blocked.)

408
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:24,666
(I got you.)

409
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:26,937
(Jong Min's camera)

410
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,867
You two should put down Jong Min.

411
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:30,337
- Gosh.
- You two handle him.

412
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:32,077
(While they're slapping each other...)

413
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:33,506
Hey, hare

414
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:35,646
(Hare Se Yoon has gotten pretty far.)

415
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:37,647
(Se Yoon's camera)

416
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:39,947
(The Ninja Turtle puts up ironclad defense.)

417
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:42,186
- Darn it.
- Handle him.

418
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:43,747
(Neither team has an advantage so far.)

419
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:45,057
Hey, hare

420
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:46,657
I got you.

421
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:48,127
What are you doing?

422
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,997
(Hare Sae Ho in the back ambushes Jong Min.)

423
00:13:51,257 --> 00:13:52,397
I did it.

424
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:56,336
Sae Ho and I will hold onto a turtle like this.

425
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:57,696
Did he say that was allowed?

426
00:13:57,697 --> 00:13:59,337
We'll just do it.

427
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,877
- Hey, they got their hands on me.
- Run.

428
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,077
(As they tie down the turtle...)

429
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,406
- Gosh.
- Okay.

430
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:09,647
(Se Yoon just has to get past one turtle.)

431
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:11,147
I'll do it.

432
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:12,346
Hey, hare

433
00:14:12,347 --> 00:14:14,287
(Jong Min, Sae Ho, and DinDin)

434
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,987
What are you doing?

435
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:18,487
- Why did you go there?
- What? What are you doing?

436
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:21,186
- Why did you go there?
- Why did you go there?

437
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:22,257
To catch them.

438
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:25,927
(Thanks to Jong Min, no one is in the hares' way.)

439
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,827
Let's go for it at the same time.

440
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:30,673
- Let's go for it at the same time.
- This isn't good. Wait.

441
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:32,097
- This isn't good.
- This is iffy.

442
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:33,407
I'll go back there.

443
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,567
- Hey, hare - Someone should just ring it.

444
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,676
(Turtle Joon tries to stop him at the last minute.)

445
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,276
Someone should just ring it.

446
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:42,117
(Sae Ho is right in front of the Dragon King.)

447
00:14:42,607 --> 00:14:44,476
- I'll do it.
- No, stop it.

448
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:45,477
(At that moment, )

449
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,647
(Turtle Joon pops Sae Ho's balloons.)

450
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,947
Sae Ho is out.

451
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:51,016
- Sae Ho is out. We got this.
- He's out!

452
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:52,517
- Which one is it?
- What?

453
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:53,826
(The Ninja Turtle has two options.)

454
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,627
- Do you think you can do it?
- Let's try it.

455
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:58,056
(Will he try to stop the powerful hare, Se Yoon?)

456
00:14:58,057 --> 00:14:59,326
(Or will he try to steal Hare DinDin's liver?)

457
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,327
Go ahead.

458
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,527
Seon Ho. Go ahead.

459
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:04,466
Hey, hare

460
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:06,907
(Joon chooses to go after DinDin.)

461
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:08,506
Hey, hare

462
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:12,277
(Meanwhile, Hare Se Yoon arrives in front of the bell.)

463
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,906
(After ringing the bell, the hares must make it back...)

464
00:15:15,907 --> 00:15:17,146
(to the starting line without getting caught...)

465
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:19,107
(by the Dragon King for their balloons to count.)

466
00:15:19,247 --> 00:15:20,417
Hey, hare

467
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,587
Wait. How many times did you move?

468
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,916
(The Dragon King who must catch them is nervous too.)

469
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:25,957
I'm scared.

470
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,326
Se Yoon, you must ring it.

471
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,326
- Keep him there, Jong Min.
- Okay.

472
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:31,027
- Stop that.
- Get ready.

473
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:32,127
Hey, hare

474
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:33,127
(He rings the bell.)

475
00:15:34,227 --> 00:15:35,366
Run fast.

476
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,437
(While Se Yoon stalls time, DinDin must run away.)

477
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,866
(But Jong Min has a tight grip on DinDin.)

478
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:42,306
- Hey! Get him.
- Run.

479
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:43,836
- Hurry back. Run! Jong Min.
- Here.

480
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:45,157
(The Dragon King is on the move.)

481
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:46,607
(DinDin is out.)

482
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:47,777
What are you doing? Darn it.

483
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,347
(He tries to run as fast as he can.)

484
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,417
(Se Yoon is out.)

485
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:54,816
- Yes!
- We got zero balloons.

486
00:15:54,817 --> 00:15:55,847
Really?

487
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,516
- We got all of them.
- He got all of us.

488
00:15:58,517 --> 00:15:59,957
He got Se Yoon toward the end.

489
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:02,226
We should run hard as soon as it begins.

490
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,426
We have to go past that point.

491
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:06,097
I guess DinDin will be the Dragon King. Right?

492
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:08,726
- DinDin is faster than the others.
- Get ready.

493
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:09,796
But I'm much faster.

494
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:12,266
We're in trouble!

495
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:13,943
(Sae Ho and Se Yoon will be turtles and play defense.)

496
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:15,567
- Sae Ho is fast.
- Yes, he is.

497
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:19,407
Should we stand together and protect you from them?

498
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:21,307
- I see.
- That's a good plan too.

499
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:22,876
- I see.
- Right?

500
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:25,023
- Should we do that?
- We can protect our balloons too.

501
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:28,247
(They adopt their opposing team's strategy from Round 1.)

502
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,656
If we stand together, they will come after us too.

503
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,026
One of them can't take us down alone.

504
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:34,057
Right.

505
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,457
We lost all of our balloons. Just do it.

506
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:38,657
We have zero points.

507
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,127
- Yes. Just go for it.
- They're frustrating.

508
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:42,996
- Okay. That's it.
- Okay. We got it.

509
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:44,597
- We're set!
- All right.

510
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,007
(The turtle is ready too.)

511
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:50,436
Get ready, set...

512
00:16:50,437 --> 00:16:52,677
(Round 2 begins.)

513
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:54,676
(The hares charge forward.)

514
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:56,876
(Jong Min, Joon, Seon Ho, Sae Ho, Se Yoon, and DinDin)

515
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:58,557
(Jong Min, Joon, Seon Ho, Sae Ho, Se Yoon)

516
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,516
It seems they have a strategy.

517
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:01,687
They're coming toward me.

518
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:06,627
(The two hares approach Sae Ho as planned.)

519
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,587
- I got you.
- Gosh.

520
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:11,197
My gosh. Darn.

521
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:13,397
You popped one of them.

522
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:17,297
(Flustered)

523
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:21,337
(The surprised hares spread out.)

524
00:17:22,237 --> 00:17:23,606
(Hare Jong Min is under attack all by himself.)

525
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:24,837
My gosh. Hey. Hold on.

526
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:29,576
- It popped.
- What happened?

527
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:30,676
- What happened?
- What was that?

528
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:31,846
- Sae Ho, you got it.
- Two.

529
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:33,246
- What are you doing?
- He's out.

530
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:34,793
- What are you doing?
- I didn't think that through.

531
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:36,817
- Wait. We didn't think it through.
- What's this?

532
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:38,356
- This wasn't part of our plan.
- What just happened?

533
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,556
What's going to happen now?

534
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:40,586
(Jong Min is out.)

535
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:41,727
Jong Min is out?

536
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:43,626
- You just need to catch one more.
- Okay.

537
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:44,756
What just happened?

538
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:46,696
- Hey, this wasn't what we planned.
- We're in trouble.

539
00:17:46,697 --> 00:17:48,196
(It was supposed to be an easy win. But it seems they might lose.)

540
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:49,626
(It was supposed to be an easy win. But it seems they might lose.)

541
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:50,666
- This is bad.
- Hey.

542
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:53,406
(Joon, Seon Ho, Sae Ho, Se Yoon)

543
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,437
(There's no way out of this.)

544
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:59,206
Hey, hare

545
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,006
- Come at me.
- Hey, hare

546
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:02,487
- Gosh, I can't see it.
- Come at me!

547
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:04,276
I thought he was a turtle in the game.

548
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:05,917
(The actual turtle seems quite violent.)

549
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:08,947
(Flinching)

550
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:10,257
Hey, hare

551
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:12,317
(Whatever, I give up.)

552
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:14,927
(The melody packs a punch like EDM beats.)

553
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:17,226
- What if they can't succeed?
- Hey, hare

554
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:18,926
- Hey, hare - Gosh, I can't see anything.

555
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:20,267
I don't see a way out of this.

556
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:22,466
(At that moment...)

557
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,236
Hey, tire them out. You got it.

558
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,277
- You got it.
- We got it.

559
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,937
(Joon moves closer to the bell amid the chaos.)

560
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,367
- You got it.
- We got it.

561
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:30,706
- Wait.
- Hey, hare

562
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:32,077
(Sae Ho tries to stop Joon.)

563
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:35,576
(Hare Seon Ho reaches the bell in an instant.)

564
00:18:35,577 --> 00:18:37,076
- Can you catch him?
- What?

565
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:38,346
Can you pop his balloons?

566
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:39,576
Hold on.

567
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,523
(He must pop more balloons before the bell rings.)

568
00:18:41,547 --> 00:18:43,687
(Sae Ho is coming after Joon's balloons.)

569
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:45,357
(A tight grip)

570
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:47,587
He's way too strong.

571
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,127
He's very strong.

572
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:53,927
(Contemplating)

573
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:56,667
(If he were to ring the bell now...)

574
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:59,097
(Since Turtle Sae Ho can't move, )

575
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:02,307
(Hare Seon Ho has to get past Turtle Se Yoon.)

576
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,377
(Glancing)

577
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:06,546
Hey, hare

578
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:09,107
(He rings the bell.)

579
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,916
(Hare Joon tries to run away.)

580
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,087
Run!

581
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:16,146
Run!

582
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:17,517
- Run!
- Hey, hare

583
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:19,316
(The Dragon King comes after Hare Joon as soon as it rings.)

584
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:20,756
(DinDin's camera)

585
00:19:20,757 --> 00:19:21,926
Run!

586
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,256
(Joon is out.)

587
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:24,356
Get him.

588
00:19:24,357 --> 00:19:25,456
Hey, hare

589
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,966
(On the other hand, another hare must run away.)

590
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,997
- Run.
- Stop him.

591
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:30,497
Stop him.

592
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,406
(It was impossible to get past the giant turtle.)

593
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:35,036
- How many?
- We won.

594
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:36,777
- We lost?
- My gosh.

595
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,836
- All of us were out.
- What? He got you?

596
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:40,176
- We were both out.
- I got both of them.

597
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:41,376
- He got us both.
- What?

598
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:43,617
- Hey, it didn't work.
- Wait. It's tied.

599
00:19:44,177 --> 00:19:46,337
- It's really tied.
- Why is it tied? That's not good.

600
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:50,257
(That's how Round 3 has begun.)

601
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:51,886
- Don't move.
- No.

602
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:53,526
- Don't move.
- Pop one.

603
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,556
That's great.

604
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:55,686
(An intense battle to win)

605
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:56,696
He's out.

606
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,856
Hey, this isn't right.

607
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:00,137
(Round 4 with changed positions)

608
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:01,666
- He can't move his feet.
- Carry him.

609
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,196
(After a close match...)

610
00:20:03,197 --> 00:20:04,337
Hey, I'm done for.

611
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:06,296
(They're tied again.)

612
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:07,407
He's out.

613
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:09,707
This will never end!

614
00:20:11,037 --> 00:20:12,506
(As they take this seriously, the score is still tied.)

615
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:13,747
This will never end.

616
00:20:14,707 --> 00:20:16,377
It's cold, but hot. It's hot, but cold.

617
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,317
What on earth is this?

618
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,716
You guys tried really hard.

619
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:22,286
- But it's tied.
- Yes.

620
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,887
We have a schedule to follow.

621
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,256
- We'll flip a coin.
- What?

622
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:27,626
- Okay.
- We should've started with that.

623
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:29,387
- No.
- My gosh.

624
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:31,026
We should've started with flipping the coin.

625
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:32,326
Who's going to toss it?

626
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:33,927
We should decide who's going to toss it.

627
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:35,737
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

628
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,367
(We don't want to play any more games.)

629
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:38,766
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

630
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:39,927
- Okay. I'll do it.
- Sae Ho.

631
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:43,067
Heads or tails? Who's going to call it?

632
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:45,506
- We should go with heads.
- Heads or tails?

633
00:20:45,507 --> 00:20:46,806
- We must always look up.
- Heads.

634
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:47,976
- We choose heads.
- Heads.

635
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:49,176
- Heads.
- So you chose the drawing side.

636
00:20:49,177 --> 00:20:50,657
- It's the drawing side.
- All right.

637
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:51,747
Here it goes.

638
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:54,987
Let's go.

639
00:20:55,787 --> 00:21:01,527
(All of their hard work depends on this coin.)

640
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:04,856
(Which team will Lady Luck favor?)

641
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:06,056
- Keep it like that.
- Flip it or not?

642
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,526
- Don't flip it. Keep it as it is.
- Flip it or not?

643
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:08,896
- Don't flip it. Keep it as it is.
- Let's flip it.

644
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:10,096
- Keep it as it is?
- Flip it.

645
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:11,396
- Flip it.
- How does it feel? Go for it.

646
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:12,496
- I'll take responsibility.
- No.

647
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:13,806
- Keep it as it is.
- Flip it.

648
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,206
- Flip it.
- Flip it.

649
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,366
Joon is calling it. We must flip it.

650
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:18,276
- We let Joon call it.
- This is what Joon wants.

651
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,706
- All right.
- Team Kim Jong Min chose the crane.

652
00:21:19,707 --> 00:21:21,046
- The crane.
- We chose the number side.

653
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,546
- Crane.
- One, two, three.

654
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,716
- We skipped school - We skipped school

655
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:24,415
Crane!

656
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:25,743
- All right.
- Team Kim Jong Min chose the crane.

657
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,143
- The crane.
- We chose the number side.

658
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:28,613
- Crane.
- One, two, three.

659
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:29,883
- We skipped school - We skipped school

660
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:32,123
Crane!

661
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,754
(Heads)

662
00:21:34,984 --> 00:21:36,853
(Team Kim Jong Min wins.)

663
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:38,893
- I told you I got this!
- This is a miracle!

664
00:21:38,894 --> 00:21:40,293
- Jong Min, I'll be good to you.
- Gosh.

665
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:41,623
I told you!

666
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:43,104
(Team Kim Jong Min earns 10 dollars.)

667
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:44,293
- Gosh.
- Jong Min.

668
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:46,303
(They earn nothing after all that hard work.)

669
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,304
This is more fun.

670
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,633
The thrill from flipping the coin is more fun.

671
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:51,943
- Their reaction is awesome.
- Yes.

672
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,904
Be reasonable. Let us keep the coin.

673
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,843
- We'll take the coin.
- Yes, let's take the coin.

674
00:21:57,844 --> 00:21:59,314
- We'll go...
- Yes.

675
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:00,743
And have lunch.

676
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:01,883
- Really?
- Already?

677
00:22:01,884 --> 00:22:03,753
We came all the way to the seaside in Namhae.

678
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:06,323
We prepared a fitting lunch for the location.

679
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:08,484
(The lunch menu, fitting for the sea in Namhae)

680
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:12,163
(The members are given two choices.)

681
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,364
(Spicy seafood soup, braised monkfish)

682
00:22:15,024 --> 00:22:17,544
Spicy seafood soup and braised monkfish. Which one do you want?

683
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:19,333
Spicy seafood soup?

684
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:20,633
- We must pick a filling meal.
- Discuss the menu...

685
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:22,314
- and pick the menu.
- Braised monkfish...

686
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:24,104
- What? What are you doing?
- What?

687
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:26,644
- How...
- You should've taken the cards.

688
00:22:27,874 --> 00:22:29,673
Why don't you peel off the sticker on the bottom?

689
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:30,713
Please.

690
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:32,683
(Something must be written on the bottom.)

691
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,644
- "Braised monkfish, physical."
- "The brain?"

692
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,313
(Team No Pain No DinDin gets the keyword, physical.)

693
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,753
This isn't so bad.

694
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:40,523
- We're better off with "physical."
- Each team...

695
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:41,824
- That's about power.
- chose...

696
00:22:42,854 --> 00:22:44,824
We should go with the brain. We're not strong.

697
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:46,893
- We're better off with "physical."
- Each team...

698
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:48,264
- That's about power.
- chose...

699
00:22:48,764 --> 00:22:50,093
Aren't we better off with the brain card?

700
00:22:50,094 --> 00:22:51,534
- We're better off with that.
- Yes.

701
00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:53,663
- Joon too.
- The world is a different place.

702
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,003
We should all eat. Let's play to our strength.

703
00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:56,403
- Yes. Let's trade.
- Let's switch.

704
00:22:56,404 --> 00:22:58,303
- Thank you.
- Okay.

705
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,874
- It's fine.
- We settled it.

706
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:02,543
- I actually wanted soup.
- Really?

707
00:23:02,544 --> 00:23:04,143
- It's tasty with rice.
- Right.

708
00:23:04,144 --> 00:23:05,144
- It's better than soup.
- Yes.

709
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:06,144
Okay. Let's go.

710
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:07,743
- Let's head out then.
- Okay.

711
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:09,813
- Will you come with us?
- Yes, we will.

712
00:23:09,814 --> 00:23:11,253
- That's uncomfortable.
- Okay.

713
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:12,974
It's a good thing we switched cards, right?

714
00:23:13,354 --> 00:23:14,623
(Current Balance)

715
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:15,793
(Team Kim Jong Min: 55 dollars)

716
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,123
(Team No Pain No DinDin: 38 dollars)

717
00:23:17,124 --> 00:23:18,893
Let's go.

718
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:20,124
Let's go.

719
00:23:20,624 --> 00:23:24,063
Was there a difficult moment for you in 2025?

720
00:23:24,064 --> 00:23:25,363
(Now that we're wrapping up 2025...)

721
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:26,503
Sleeping without the tent.

722
00:23:26,504 --> 00:23:28,403
(He picks the Goheung trip where he slept without the tent.)

723
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:30,173
- I'd pick that too.
- By the sea. Right?

724
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:32,243
- Actually, I performed...
- Oh, the mosquitoes?

725
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,274
- at an event in Goheung.
- Right.

726
00:23:34,644 --> 00:23:36,773
There were so many mosquitoes.

727
00:23:36,774 --> 00:23:38,820
It had been a while since I couldn't get any sleep like that.

728
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:41,013
- Really?
- That trip was really tough.

729
00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:42,653
(That trip was really tough.)

730
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,253
- Right.
- The trip By 100 joined too.

731
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:45,924
He came on a really cold day.

732
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:47,283
He made us take off our clothes...

733
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:48,623
- for the pictures.
- Gosh.

734
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:50,094
- It was cold that day.
- Yes.

735
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,824
Mount Halla was tough too.

736
00:23:53,664 --> 00:23:55,564
- I'd pick Mount Halla too.
- Mount Halla...

737
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:57,364
Right. I just remembered.

738
00:23:57,694 --> 00:23:58,864
It was raining that day.

739
00:24:00,364 --> 00:24:01,964
(They had to climb Mount Halla...)

740
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,234
(while facing the rainstorm.)

741
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:06,903
That wasn't easy.

742
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,173
(He still vividly remembers the hike.)

743
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:09,813
The Real Winter Training Center was tough too.

744
00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:10,843
- The Real Winter Training Center.
- That's...

745
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:12,644
We built a house, so we could sleep in there.

746
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:15,654
(They splashed the valley water on Joon's back too.)

747
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:18,453
(The scary memories from the Real Winter Training Center)

748
00:24:18,454 --> 00:24:19,684
- It was so cold.
- Right.

749
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:22,553
The grilled pork belly that day was really good.

750
00:24:22,554 --> 00:24:24,523
- Food makes us forget things.
- Right.

751
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:25,993
Food wipes out everything.

752
00:24:25,994 --> 00:24:27,594
- That explains our lives.
- Yes.

753
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:29,063
It's about sleeping...

754
00:24:29,064 --> 00:24:30,064
- and eating well.
- Right.

755
00:24:30,065 --> 00:24:31,333
- It doesn't matter how tough it is.
- Right.

756
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:32,503
As long as you get good food,

757
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,663
- everything disappears.
- Right.

758
00:24:33,664 --> 00:24:34,733
- No matter how hard your day was, - Right.

759
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:35,803
When you sleep in a warm room,

760
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:36,973
- everything disappears.
- It all disappears.

761
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:38,404
This is a great TV show.

762
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,943
(While discussing the charms of the show...)

763
00:24:41,944 --> 00:24:43,174
We're already here.

764
00:24:44,574 --> 00:24:46,734
Something smells good. There must be many restaurants.

765
00:24:47,014 --> 00:24:48,143
- I can smell mills.
- Yes.

766
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:49,413
- It smells savory.
- It's a savory smell.

767
00:24:49,414 --> 00:24:51,294
Spicy seafood soup must be famous in this town.

768
00:24:51,884 --> 00:24:54,123
- I see pufferfish restaurants.
- Pufferfish sounds good.

769
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:55,453
- Slow down.
- Okay.

770
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:56,553
- The spicy seafood soup?
- Where?

771
00:24:56,554 --> 00:24:57,693
- Bye.
- Enjoy your lunch.

772
00:24:57,694 --> 00:24:58,694
- Braised monkfish.
- Hey.

773
00:24:58,694 --> 00:24:59,694
- Enjoy.
- Make sure to eat.

774
00:24:59,694 --> 00:25:00,694
- Make sure to win.
- It's over there.

775
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:02,175
- Hey, make sure to win.
- Good luck.

776
00:25:02,894 --> 00:25:04,464
Our keyword is physical, right?

777
00:25:04,864 --> 00:25:06,164
That's our keyword.

778
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:08,433
- "Physical: Asia."
- My gosh.

779
00:25:08,434 --> 00:25:09,734
Hey, that looks so good.

780
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:12,114
- That looks authentic.
- I can eat three bowls of rice.

781
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,944
That will taste so good with rice.

782
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:15,174
All right.

783
00:25:15,274 --> 00:25:17,014
You chose the braised monkfish.

784
00:25:17,444 --> 00:25:18,844
I'm going to mix it with rice.

785
00:25:20,544 --> 00:25:22,113
(The perfect combination...)

786
00:25:22,114 --> 00:25:23,753
(of the spicy and chewy monkfish and crunchy bean sprouts)

787
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:24,953
You have to...

788
00:25:24,954 --> 00:25:27,824
spend the money you have for today's lunch.

789
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:31,154
How much do we have now?

790
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,293
It's 50 dollars?

791
00:25:34,294 --> 00:25:36,575
(They can have lunch if they spend everything they have.)

792
00:25:36,894 --> 00:25:39,134
You'll need more money if you want to...

793
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,903
enjoy the meal at ease.

794
00:25:40,904 --> 00:25:41,934
- Yes.
- Of course.

795
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,603
- You chose the braised monkfish.
- Let us double it.

796
00:25:44,604 --> 00:25:46,174
Your mission is...

797
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:48,504
Physical Cham, Cham, Cham.

798
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:50,750
- That's a physical mission?
- How is that a physical mission?

799
00:25:50,774 --> 00:25:51,774
This?

800
00:25:52,144 --> 00:25:54,064
You will now have to pick one physical activity.

801
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:56,484
Sit-ups, push-ups,

802
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:58,483
- and the twister arm trainer.
- Gosh, no way.

803
00:25:58,484 --> 00:26:00,754
You must pick 1 among these 3 choices.

804
00:26:01,254 --> 00:26:02,753
You'll try this for 100 seconds.

805
00:26:02,754 --> 00:26:04,424
See? I'm not strong.

806
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:06,163
For five repetitions,

807
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,124
you get one chance to play the game.

808
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:09,633
- For five repetitions?
- Yes.

809
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,993
- If we succeed...
- Every time...

810
00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:13,464
you're defeated, we'll deduct five repetitions.

811
00:26:14,164 --> 00:26:16,404
- There's no point then.
- We'll just stay at zero.

812
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,714
If you're very unlucky, that could happen.

813
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:19,943
So...

814
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:22,214
In the end, for each successful attempt,

815
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,113
you will earn 30 cents.

816
00:26:25,114 --> 00:26:26,213
- Only 30 cents?
- Only 30 cents?

817
00:26:26,214 --> 00:26:28,113
- Then to eat braised monkfish...
- Then...

818
00:26:28,114 --> 00:26:30,883
We should try our best not to spend the money we have.

819
00:26:30,884 --> 00:26:32,013
- We should.
- Or we'll end up in the water.

820
00:26:32,014 --> 00:26:33,123
- Right.
- So don't think about...

821
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,223
having a tasty meal.

822
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:35,224
- This trip...
- Why not?

823
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:36,593
- Listen.
- Hey, they give us rice and kimchi.

824
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,793
Kimchi and rice...

825
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:39,823
I've been eating only kimchi and rice for months.

826
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:42,294
It can't be helped. Otherwise, we have to go in the water.

827
00:26:42,364 --> 00:26:44,233
Look. Doesn't the food look good?

828
00:26:44,234 --> 00:26:45,293
That's not...

829
00:26:45,294 --> 00:26:47,564
You have no idea, do you?

830
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,173
- Unlike us, you're young.
- Right.

831
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:52,374
If Jong Min goes in the water, his bones will hurt.

832
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,344
I'd be glad if it's just my bones.

833
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,913
- What else hurts?
- No, I mean...

834
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:58,513
- He'd be heartbroken.
- I'd also be heartbroken.

835
00:26:58,514 --> 00:26:59,883
Right? This is...

836
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,414
- Anyway, here's our plan.
- Yes?

837
00:27:01,814 --> 00:27:03,713
In my opinion, push-ups require the most strength.

838
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:04,883
- So I'll do them.
- Okay.

839
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,553
I think you should do sit-ups.

840
00:27:06,554 --> 00:27:08,123
- How many sit-ups can you do?
- I don't know. I never tried them.

841
00:27:08,124 --> 00:27:09,223
You'd better do sit-ups.

842
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:10,293
- I can't do them.
- You can do them.

843
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:11,393
- I haven't done any.
- You can do them.

844
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:12,693
I can only do 30 of them.

845
00:27:12,694 --> 00:27:14,163
Jong Min would be better with the twister arm trainer.

846
00:27:14,164 --> 00:27:16,793
- Okay.
- That's what we'll do.

847
00:27:16,794 --> 00:27:19,334
- Can you really keep doing them?
- I can do 500 push-ups.

848
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:21,163
Don't make me laugh.

849
00:27:21,164 --> 00:27:23,603
(Joon's highest record is 125 push-ups.)

850
00:27:23,604 --> 00:27:25,033
Let's try to win 50 dollars.

851
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:26,343
Let's give it a try.

852
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,173
After that, we'll see where we are.

853
00:27:28,174 --> 00:27:29,513
Let me say one more thing.

854
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,474
The other team will definitely spend their money.

855
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:33,584
They'll say, "Since we're here, we should eat."

856
00:27:33,744 --> 00:27:36,054
- Their attitude is the problem.
- No...

857
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:39,154
There are crabs inside.

858
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:41,124
It's really spicy seafood soup.

859
00:27:41,384 --> 00:27:42,854
My mouth is watering.

860
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:45,224
- There are clams too.
- There's also abalone.

861
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:47,163
The seasoning must be inside.

862
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:48,623
It will turn red when it gets boiled.

863
00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:49,733
- Let's sit down.
- Do we sit down?

864
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:50,734
Let's sit.

865
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,934
(Spicy seafood soup with an entire octopus)

866
00:27:55,404 --> 00:27:57,133
- It costs 50 dollars.
- Gosh, it's expensive.

867
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,473
How could they sell rice and kimchi for two dollars?

868
00:27:59,474 --> 00:28:00,843
How could they charge us for kimchi?

869
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:02,914
You will need more allowance for the meal.

870
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:04,973
Your team mission is called...

871
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,884
Separating the Brain.

872
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:09,513
- "Separating?"
- For 60 seconds,

873
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:10,754
while counting the bills,

874
00:28:11,384 --> 00:28:13,653
you have to take orders at the restaurant.

875
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:17,054
(2. Taking orders at the same time)

876
00:28:17,824 --> 00:28:19,324
When the time is up,

877
00:28:19,524 --> 00:28:22,023
you must guess the sum of the total amount of bills...

878
00:28:22,024 --> 00:28:23,764
and the order amount.

879
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:26,233
In my opinion, gimbap would cost two dollars.

880
00:28:26,234 --> 00:28:27,833
- Right.
- Tteokbokki would cost three.

881
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:29,633
While adding the amount,

882
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:32,174
you have to count the number of bills in your hands.

883
00:28:32,374 --> 00:28:34,173
- That's correct.
- You understand games very well,

884
00:28:34,174 --> 00:28:35,934
- but you're bad at playing them.
- I'm bad.

885
00:28:35,974 --> 00:28:37,843
You're just good at explaining.

886
00:28:37,844 --> 00:28:39,613
Here's what happened when I took math tests.

887
00:28:39,614 --> 00:28:41,814
When I asked, "Is this how you solve the problem?"

888
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,313
the teacher said, "Yes, go ahead and solve it."

889
00:28:43,314 --> 00:28:44,514
My answer was wrong.

890
00:28:44,714 --> 00:28:46,553
You disappointed your teacher. He expected a lot from you.

891
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:48,024
- Right.
- Gosh, Sae Ho.

892
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:50,293
(Handing the bills for the mission)

893
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:51,593
We'll show you the menu for ten seconds.

894
00:28:51,594 --> 00:28:52,763
(DinDin's hamburger restaurant)

895
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,163
(Cheeseburger 1.5 dollars, )

896
00:28:54,164 --> 00:28:55,363
(pizza of all types 4 dollars, draft beer 2 dollars, )

897
00:28:55,364 --> 00:28:56,664
(extra patty 50 cents)

898
00:28:56,764 --> 00:28:58,464
DinDin will start.

899
00:28:58,594 --> 00:29:00,534
Get ready, set, go.

900
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:05,944
(Before an order comes in, he counts the bills fast.)

901
00:29:06,404 --> 00:29:07,574
Sir?

902
00:29:08,304 --> 00:29:09,674
Three cheeseburgers, please.

903
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:11,443
Can I add an extra patty?

904
00:29:11,444 --> 00:29:13,343
- Never mind.
- What did you say?

905
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,513
- Hey, talk to me slowly.
- Okay.

906
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:16,853
Three cheeseburgers?

907
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:18,313
I'd like three cheeseburgers,

908
00:29:18,314 --> 00:29:19,654
and I won't order extra patty.

909
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:22,254
(That's 4.5 dollars.)

910
00:29:22,424 --> 00:29:23,993
I'd like one pepperoni pizza.

911
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:25,394
Do you have any set menu?

912
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:27,524
I'll also get one draft beer.

913
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:30,034
(Breaking down slowly)

914
00:29:30,294 --> 00:29:31,864
(It's a customer who eats a lot.)

915
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:34,374
After thinking about it, I'd also like one cheeseburger.

916
00:29:34,764 --> 00:29:36,304
With one extra patty.

917
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:37,904
The hamburger is delicious.

918
00:29:38,134 --> 00:29:39,734
- What's delicious?
- Two draft beers...

919
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,744
No, I'll get one more draft beer.

920
00:29:42,474 --> 00:29:43,844
He's driving me insane.

921
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:47,984
(He starts counting the bills again.)

922
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,114
(Before the orders piled up)

923
00:29:52,354 --> 00:29:55,284
(He had counted 15 dollars.)

924
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,854
The hamburger is delicious.

925
00:29:58,024 --> 00:30:00,264
(Due to a flood of orders, )

926
00:30:00,694 --> 00:30:02,363
(his calculation collapsed.)

927
00:30:02,364 --> 00:30:03,664
He's driving me insane.

928
00:30:04,364 --> 00:30:06,834
(Counting again from the start)

929
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:09,433
(This is difficult.)

930
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:10,573
Sir, I'm sorry,

931
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:12,943
but I'll cancel the pizza and order one more cheeseburger.

932
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,703
(5 orders of cheeseburger, 2 draft beers, 1 extra patty)

933
00:30:14,704 --> 00:30:16,824
(Is he focusing only on the bills without listening?)

934
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:18,814
This must be a popular restaurant.

935
00:30:19,114 --> 00:30:20,584
I'll get one more cheeseburger.

936
00:30:21,514 --> 00:30:23,353
(We can't tell what's behind the restaurant owner's smile.)

937
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,854
Five, four, three,

938
00:30:26,354 --> 00:30:28,424
two, one. Time's up.

939
00:30:28,624 --> 00:30:30,754
Sir, what's the total?

940
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,224
I'm sorry.

941
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:36,463
(Oh, my goodness)

942
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:37,733
Let's move on.

943
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:38,734
Just take a guess.

944
00:30:38,735 --> 00:30:40,204
You know the number of bills, right?

945
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:41,504
This is 30 dollars.

946
00:30:41,864 --> 00:30:43,403
- Really?
- It's 30 dollars.

947
00:30:43,404 --> 00:30:45,173
I gave up on the orders and counted instead.

948
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:46,973
- I know the order amount.
- Really?

949
00:30:46,974 --> 00:30:49,113
- I paid attention to the orders.
- It's 13 dollars.

950
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:52,273
Think about whether it ends with 50 cents or not.

951
00:30:52,274 --> 00:30:54,013
I don't think it ends with 50 cents.

952
00:30:54,014 --> 00:30:55,743
The order of extra patty for the cheeseburger...

953
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,184
I don't think it ends with 50 cents.

954
00:30:57,414 --> 00:30:58,914
(Don't be tactless.)

955
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,123
- What?
- It ends with 50 cents.

956
00:31:03,124 --> 00:31:05,553
(He can't say anything.)

957
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:07,494
I don't think it ends with 50 cents.

958
00:31:08,194 --> 00:31:09,563
- Just do it.
- What's DinDin's choice?

959
00:31:09,564 --> 00:31:10,733
Trust your luck.

960
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:11,934
It's 52 dollars.

961
00:31:12,094 --> 00:31:14,174
- The total order was 22 dollars?
- Yes, 22 dollars.

962
00:31:14,564 --> 00:31:17,174
I think it's less than 15 dollars.

963
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:18,634
Here's the total order.

964
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:21,473
- It's 13.5 dollars.
- See?

965
00:31:21,474 --> 00:31:23,073
- There are 50 cents.
- DinDin, you failed.

966
00:31:23,074 --> 00:31:24,444
I said that there were.

967
00:31:24,574 --> 00:31:26,614
When I asked if it ended with 50 cents, you did...

968
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,783
- You raised your face.
- Gosh.

969
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:30,853
- That's why...
- Is that what you thought?

970
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:32,353
- I meant to say yes.
- Really?

971
00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:33,554
Yes.

972
00:31:34,354 --> 00:31:36,153
(6 cheeseburgers, 2 draft beers, 1 extra patty)

973
00:31:36,154 --> 00:31:37,723
(A total of 13.5 dollars)

974
00:31:37,724 --> 00:31:38,954
Take a look.

975
00:31:38,994 --> 00:31:40,764
Now that I think about it,

976
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:42,594
you don't have to count the bills.

977
00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:44,894
- Just calculate the orders.
- Right.

978
00:31:45,264 --> 00:31:47,403
Then we'd win a little over ten dollars.

979
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:49,874
- Is Sae Ho next?
- I'll go.

980
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,204
We'll show you the rest stop menu for ten seconds.

981
00:31:53,104 --> 00:31:55,204
The rice cake and sausage skewer is annoying.

982
00:31:55,574 --> 00:31:57,014
There are also sausages.

983
00:31:58,944 --> 00:32:00,984
- I'll start.
- Okay, here we go.

984
00:32:01,414 --> 00:32:03,784
Get ready, set, go.

985
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:05,984
- Hello.
- Hello.

986
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:10,594
Gosh, there are Dippin' Dots.

987
00:32:11,394 --> 00:32:13,263
Can I get 1 sausage and 1 walnut cake?

988
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,264
What would you like?

989
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,723
One sausage and one walnut cake.

990
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:17,633
- One of each?
- Yes. Wait.

991
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:20,463
Cancel the sausage. I'll get one rice cake and sausage skewer.

992
00:32:20,464 --> 00:32:21,504
Okay.

993
00:32:21,964 --> 00:32:23,334
(He only counted 5 bills so far.)

994
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:25,714
(He's concentrating only on the order amount.)

995
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:27,704
I'll also get two Dippin' Dots.

996
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:30,024
- And one more walnut cake.
- What did you say?

997
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,834
No matter how much I eat, I'm still hungry.

998
00:32:32,014 --> 00:32:34,814
I'll get 1 more rice cake and sausage skewer and 1 sausage.

999
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,714
Okay.

1000
00:32:38,254 --> 00:32:40,183
(He separates 5 more bills when he gets a moment.)

1001
00:32:40,184 --> 00:32:41,854
Mom told me not to eat too much.

1002
00:32:42,384 --> 00:32:44,894
I'll cancel 1 sausage and 1 Dippin' Dots.

1003
00:32:45,094 --> 00:32:46,424
Okay, take them out.

1004
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,493
Can I get three more sausages?

1005
00:32:48,494 --> 00:32:50,263
(Can I get three more sausages?)

1006
00:32:50,264 --> 00:32:52,604
- Okay.
- Five, four,

1007
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:56,204
three, two, one. Time is up.

1008
00:32:56,404 --> 00:32:58,533
- Sir, how much is the total?
- Sae Ho got it.

1009
00:32:58,534 --> 00:33:00,574
I think he definitely has it.

1010
00:33:00,874 --> 00:33:02,574
I counted ten dollars.

1011
00:33:03,144 --> 00:33:04,644
I have ten dollars.

1012
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:07,883
(What's the total order that he calculated in his head?)

1013
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:08,984
It's 14 dollars.

1014
00:33:09,514 --> 00:33:11,183
The total is 24 dollars.

1015
00:33:11,184 --> 00:33:12,753
That's correct.

1016
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:13,823
- Isn't it 13 dollars?
- We'll count the bills.

1017
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:14,923
- The total is 24 dollars.
- Okay.

1018
00:33:14,924 --> 00:33:16,053
(Counting the number of bills)

1019
00:33:16,054 --> 00:33:17,754
- You're correct.
- Right?

1020
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:20,723
Sae Ho, you succeeded.

1021
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:22,733
- You won 24 dollars.
- Okay.

1022
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,233
- Okay.
- Okay.

1023
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:25,934
- You got it?
- It was really hard.

1024
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:27,963
- Hey.
- This is how you do it.

1025
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,433
(2 walnut cakes, 2 rice cake and sausage skewers, 3 sausages...)

1026
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:31,073
(A total of 14 dollars)

1027
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:32,873
Instead of counting the bills, just focus on the orders.

1028
00:33:32,874 --> 00:33:33,904
No.

1029
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:35,744
- Let's go big.
- No.

1030
00:33:35,904 --> 00:33:37,313
Let's go big. I'll try.

1031
00:33:37,314 --> 00:33:38,643
- You will go big?
- One big round.

1032
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:40,083
- Okay, go ahead.
- Let's win a few tens of dollars.

1033
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,444
Don't you think the other team will take a risk?

1034
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:44,584
Here's some advice.

1035
00:33:45,084 --> 00:33:47,653
It's good to talk a lot with the customer.

1036
00:33:47,654 --> 00:33:49,054
You can ask him to repeat.

1037
00:33:49,324 --> 00:33:51,693
Also, it looks like he gives you...

1038
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,163
about five seconds after making an order.

1039
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,823
You can count the bills during that time.

1040
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,193
- What are you eating?
- I'm not eating. It's lip balm.

1041
00:33:57,194 --> 00:33:58,494
(Do you want some lip balm?)

1042
00:33:58,964 --> 00:34:00,634
- If it's good food, share with us.
- No.

1043
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:02,973
We'll show you the bakery menu for ten seconds.

1044
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,003
Okay.

1045
00:34:04,004 --> 00:34:05,203
(Sweet red bean and walnut bun, sandwich, )

1046
00:34:05,204 --> 00:34:06,343
(lemonade, Americano)

1047
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,073
You didn't say that the bakery sold beverages too.

1048
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:09,413
(Menu)

1049
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,174
They should only sell bread. Sandwich, sweet red bean bun.

1050
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:13,383
There are two types of bread?

1051
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,813
- Yes, here we go.
- Okay.

1052
00:34:14,814 --> 00:34:16,413
(Lastly, Se Yoon starts.)

1053
00:34:16,414 --> 00:34:18,914
Get ready, set, go.

1054
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,023
(Counting smoothly)

1055
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:22,424
Sweet red bean buns look delicious.

1056
00:34:25,624 --> 00:34:26,664
Really?

1057
00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:29,563
One sweet red bean and walnut bun and one Americano, please.

1058
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:31,444
That would be three dollars. Do you have money?

1059
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,334
(He responds with the order amount.)

1060
00:34:33,764 --> 00:34:35,564
(He starts counting again.)

1061
00:34:35,764 --> 00:34:36,773
(That's a good strategy.)

1062
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:37,774
I'll order a beverage too.

1063
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,843
- One lemonade, please.
- One lemonade?

1064
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,143
I'll cancel the Americano.

1065
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:43,174
You want to cancel it? Goodness.

1066
00:34:43,444 --> 00:34:44,644
You can't cancel it.

1067
00:34:45,274 --> 00:34:46,614
You can't cancel it. Okay.

1068
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:48,983
I'll also get a sandwich. I'm hungry.

1069
00:34:48,984 --> 00:34:50,153
- You want one sandwich?
- Yes,

1070
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,284
- and one more walnut bun.
- One more walnut bun?

1071
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,983
Then...

1072
00:34:53,984 --> 00:34:55,383
(As soon as an order gets canceled)

1073
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,594
What else?

1074
00:34:59,124 --> 00:35:00,563
(His brain and hands stopped.)

1075
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:01,564
Gosh, I'm sleepy.

1076
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:02,793
I'll cancel the lemonade.

1077
00:35:02,794 --> 00:35:04,164
I'll get one Americano.

1078
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:06,763
Cancel the lemonade?

1079
00:35:06,764 --> 00:35:08,103
You have no manners.

1080
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:09,704
You didn't get proper education at home.

1081
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,103
- Really?
- Gosh,

1082
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:12,673
- this sandwich is really good.
- Yes.

1083
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:14,073
- I'll get one more.
- One more?

1084
00:35:14,074 --> 00:35:15,514
I'll get one more Americano as well.

1085
00:35:15,644 --> 00:35:17,744
One more Americano? Okay.

1086
00:35:18,514 --> 00:35:19,683
(He's running out of time.)

1087
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,090
(Se Yoon is counting the bills quickly.)

1088
00:35:21,114 --> 00:35:23,584
- Lastly, one sandwich...
- Yes?

1089
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:25,213
And sweet red bean and walnut bun...

1090
00:35:25,214 --> 00:35:27,354
Never mind, I'll just get one more sandwich.

1091
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:29,824
- Okay.
- Five, four,

1092
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,424
three, two, one. Time is up.

1093
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,293
Sir, how much is the total?

1094
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:37,564
You brat, the total is...

1095
00:35:38,364 --> 00:35:39,734
It's 40.5 dollars.

1096
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:42,934
How much is the total order?

1097
00:35:43,104 --> 00:35:44,203
I said it's 40.5 dollars.

1098
00:35:44,204 --> 00:35:46,103
Just the order without the bills.

1099
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:47,143
I don't know.

1100
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:48,743
- We'll count the bills.
- You don't understand what I mean?

1101
00:35:48,744 --> 00:35:49,773
We'll see if he's right.

1102
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:52,374
I think the total order is 11.5 dollars.

1103
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:53,683
Does it end with 50 cents?

1104
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,283
- It's 11.5 dollars.
- Okay, my answer was 40.5 dollars.

1105
00:35:55,284 --> 00:35:56,853
Se Yoon had a lot of bills.

1106
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,314
Here's the total order amount.

1107
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:00,823
- Here's the total order.
- It should end with 50 cents.

1108
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:02,284
- It's 10.5 dollars.
- Okay.

1109
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:04,394
Then did I count 30 bills?

1110
00:36:04,654 --> 00:36:06,993
- If it's 30 dollars, - Then I'll win 40.5 dollars.

1111
00:36:06,994 --> 00:36:08,924
- you'll win 40.5 dollars.
- Se Yoon counted...

1112
00:36:09,194 --> 00:36:10,994
- so many bills.
- Wait a minute.

1113
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:12,763
I didn't count by ten bills.

1114
00:36:12,764 --> 00:36:14,003
Se Yoon.

1115
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:15,263
(How many bills did Se Yoon have?)

1116
00:36:15,264 --> 00:36:17,274
- He's correct.
- You'll win if it's 30 dollars.

1117
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:18,474
(Will it be 30 dollars?)

1118
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:19,973
- Let's hear it.
- The number of bills.

1119
00:36:19,974 --> 00:36:20,705
Please.

1120
00:36:20,786 --> 00:36:22,956
- Please.
- It's 32 dollars.

1121
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:25,978
You failed the mission.

1122
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:27,708
That was so close.

1123
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:30,648
It would've been big if he had won.

1124
00:36:32,718 --> 00:36:35,287
It reminds me of the first episode with Sae Ho.

1125
00:36:35,288 --> 00:36:36,394
(Team Kim Jong Min also starts their mission.)

1126
00:36:36,418 --> 00:36:37,957
- Please cheer for me.
- You can do it.

1127
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,088
- You can do it.
- Seon Ho.

1128
00:36:39,288 --> 00:36:40,358
Use the momentum.

1129
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:43,398
Remember that you earn 30 cents every time you do more.

1130
00:36:43,528 --> 00:36:44,808
Use the momentum no matter what.

1131
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:47,828
- Ready, set, go.
- Go.

1132
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:50,638
Let's go. He's quick. Nice.

1133
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:52,538
- Five.
- Cham, cham, cham.

1134
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:54,008
Gosh, one.

1135
00:36:54,068 --> 00:36:55,237
Two, three.

1136
00:36:55,238 --> 00:36:57,138
He'll make it. Keep going.

1137
00:36:57,578 --> 00:36:59,408
- Cham, cham, cham.
- What's wrong with you?

1138
00:36:59,848 --> 00:37:01,778
- Seon Ho, do the opposite.
- Two, three,

1139
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:02,994
- Try the opposite this time.
- four,

1140
00:37:03,018 --> 00:37:04,717
- five.
- Cham, cham, cham.

1141
00:37:04,718 --> 00:37:05,918
I told you to do the opposite.

1142
00:37:06,048 --> 00:37:07,347
- Are you failing?
- Seon Ho.

1143
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:09,817
- Three, four, five.
- What's wrong with you?

1144
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:11,338
- Do the opposite.
- Cham, cham, cham.

1145
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,187
- One, two, - Did he fail all of them?

1146
00:37:13,188 --> 00:37:14,687
- He failed all of them.
- What are you doing?

1147
00:37:14,688 --> 00:37:16,257
Four, five.

1148
00:37:16,258 --> 00:37:17,397
Cham, cham, cham.

1149
00:37:17,398 --> 00:37:18,627
What are you doing?

1150
00:37:18,628 --> 00:37:20,644
- You have 50 percent of winning.
- Don't follow him.

1151
00:37:20,668 --> 00:37:22,697
You have 50 percent of winning.

1152
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,738
Cham, cham, cham.

1153
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:24,838
What's wrong with you?

1154
00:37:25,338 --> 00:37:27,468
- What?
- Are you following the finger?

1155
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:29,407
Four, five.

1156
00:37:29,408 --> 00:37:30,508
Cham, cham, cham.

1157
00:37:31,338 --> 00:37:34,407
- Two.
- You're extremely unlucky.

1158
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:36,617
Gosh, I feel bad for him.

1159
00:37:36,618 --> 00:37:37,677
Cham, cham, cham.

1160
00:37:37,678 --> 00:37:38,747
Okay.

1161
00:37:38,748 --> 00:37:40,547
- Did I win 30 cents?
- You have 50 seconds.

1162
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:42,817
- Eight, nine, - What are we doing?

1163
00:37:42,818 --> 00:37:44,287
- ten.
- Cham, cham, cham.

1164
00:37:44,288 --> 00:37:45,928
- Right?
- Nice.

1165
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:48,428
- Twelve, thirteen, - He has a long way to go.

1166
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:50,527
- fourteen...
- Isn't it fifteen?

1167
00:37:50,528 --> 00:37:51,898
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Okay.

1168
00:37:52,198 --> 00:37:54,227
Sixteen, seventeen,

1169
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:56,637
eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

1170
00:37:56,638 --> 00:37:57,867
- Nice.
- Cham, cham, cham.

1171
00:37:57,868 --> 00:37:58,967
Okay.

1172
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:00,807
- Twenty-one, twenty-two, - You have thirty seconds left.

1173
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:02,407
- Hey.
- You're earning for your food.

1174
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:04,337
- Twenty-four, twenty-five...
- You did a lot.

1175
00:38:04,338 --> 00:38:05,348
Cham, cham, cham.

1176
00:38:06,178 --> 00:38:07,208
All right.

1177
00:38:07,348 --> 00:38:08,677
- Twenty-seven...
- That was nice.

1178
00:38:08,678 --> 00:38:10,948
He kept his eyes open and looked the other way.

1179
00:38:11,048 --> 00:38:12,087
- Thirty.
- Keep your eyes open.

1180
00:38:12,088 --> 00:38:13,548
- Cham, cham, cham.
- That's right.

1181
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:17,517
- Thirty-three, thirty-four, - He's good at this.

1182
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:18,827
- You have ten seconds.
- thirty-five.

1183
00:38:18,828 --> 00:38:20,687
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Okay.

1184
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:23,427
Thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight,

1185
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:24,727
thirty-nine, forty.

1186
00:38:24,728 --> 00:38:25,897
- It's the last time.
- Cham, cham, cham.

1187
00:38:25,898 --> 00:38:27,927
(He fails to defend at the end.)

1188
00:38:27,928 --> 00:38:29,497
- It wasn't bad.
- Thirty-five?

1189
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:30,968
How much did we earn?

1190
00:38:31,238 --> 00:38:32,938
Five got deducted from forty.

1191
00:38:33,608 --> 00:38:34,637
Is it 10.5 dollars?

1192
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:36,907
(They won 10.5 dollars.)

1193
00:38:36,908 --> 00:38:38,177
I earned more than I thought.

1194
00:38:38,178 --> 00:38:39,178
(Seon Ho earned enough for his portion.)

1195
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:40,408
You earned your portion.

1196
00:38:40,678 --> 00:38:42,447
- Next up is Joon.
- Goodness.

1197
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:44,147
We've been told...

1198
00:38:44,148 --> 00:38:46,447
that it will be difficult today.

1199
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:47,947
Let's do our best in every game.

1200
00:38:47,948 --> 00:38:49,157
- Okay.
- Yes.

1201
00:38:49,158 --> 00:38:51,058
- I'll work very hard.
- We must work hard now.

1202
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:53,587
- If we don't go in the water, - Exactly.

1203
00:38:53,588 --> 00:38:54,657
We'd feel relieved.

1204
00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:56,027
- If we go in the water...
- Joon.

1205
00:38:56,028 --> 00:38:58,057
- Cham, Cham, Cham is important.
- Right.

1206
00:38:58,058 --> 00:38:59,867
- I failed ten in the beginning.
- I will do push-ups so fast...

1207
00:38:59,868 --> 00:39:01,467
that Cham, Cham, Cham becomes insignificant.

1208
00:39:01,468 --> 00:39:02,797
- Okay.
- Goodness.

1209
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,667
One, two, three, four, five. Cham, cham, cham.

1210
00:39:04,668 --> 00:39:05,668
(At this speed, he'd play Cham, Cham, Cham 100 times.)

1211
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:07,238
I'll do them this fast.

1212
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:09,207
- Okay.
- Okay.

1213
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:11,878
- Play at that speed.
- Okay, I will.

1214
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:13,478
Nothing stands in my way.

1215
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,048
- All right.
- I do push-ups very quickly.

1216
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:18,938
Show us that you aren't Fashion Muscle.

1217
00:39:19,288 --> 00:39:20,318
Okay.

1218
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:22,808
If you don't make it, you'll be flabby like water balloon.

1219
00:39:22,888 --> 00:39:24,388
- All right.
- Get ready.

1220
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:25,558
Let's go, Joon.

1221
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:27,587
Set, go.

1222
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:28,698
Let's go.

1223
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:30,297
- Three, five.
- Four.

1224
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:31,827
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Okay.

1225
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:32,867
(He's off to a good start.)

1226
00:39:32,868 --> 00:39:33,967
Don't stop.

1227
00:39:33,968 --> 00:39:35,138
Cham, cham, cham.

1228
00:39:35,598 --> 00:39:36,668
He's crazy.

1229
00:39:36,698 --> 00:39:38,568
- Four, five.
- Cham, cham, cham.

1230
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:40,738
What's going on with Joon?

1231
00:39:41,408 --> 00:39:42,508
Cham, cham, cham.

1232
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:43,837
He's out of his mind.

1233
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:45,077
(Amazing speed and perfect Cham, Cham, Cham defense)

1234
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:46,148
Cham, cham, cham.

1235
00:39:46,408 --> 00:39:47,447
What?

1236
00:39:47,448 --> 00:39:49,047
Braised monkfish is getting closer.

1237
00:39:49,048 --> 00:39:50,677
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Gosh.

1238
00:39:50,678 --> 00:39:52,947
(The person to count on today is Joon.)

1239
00:39:52,948 --> 00:39:54,117
Cham, cham, cham.

1240
00:39:54,118 --> 00:39:55,118
The pattern keeps repeating.

1241
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,518
Joon, change the pattern.

1242
00:39:56,918 --> 00:39:58,628
- Cham, cham, cham.
- It's okay.

1243
00:40:01,158 --> 00:40:02,258
Cham, cham, cham.

1244
00:40:02,658 --> 00:40:03,658
It's okay.

1245
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:05,467
I think you mastered the pattern.

1246
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:07,528
- Cham, cham, cham.
- What's wrong with you, Joon?

1247
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:09,398
You're running out of time.

1248
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:11,268
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Okay.

1249
00:40:11,938 --> 00:40:13,107
- I'm tired.
- Hurry up.

1250
00:40:13,108 --> 00:40:15,378
It's only been a minute. Keep going.

1251
00:40:17,378 --> 00:40:18,378
- He...
- Gosh.

1252
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:19,548
(It's only been 1 minute.)

1253
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:22,278
(Out of strength)

1254
00:40:22,948 --> 00:40:24,118
Cham, cham, cham.

1255
00:40:24,478 --> 00:40:27,088
- I'm really tired.
- Hurry up, Joon.

1256
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:28,857
I can't do it anymore.

1257
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:30,557
You said that you could do 500.

1258
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:31,558
(You said that you could do 500.)

1259
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:33,457
- You can't stop now.
- Why can't I do more?

1260
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:34,458
Cham, cham, cham.

1261
00:40:34,459 --> 00:40:35,657
- What are you doing?
- Wait.

1262
00:40:35,658 --> 00:40:37,197
(He ends up betraying them.)

1263
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:38,297
Goodness.

1264
00:40:38,298 --> 00:40:39,327
You have a lot of time left.

1265
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:41,267
My body is paralyzed.

1266
00:40:41,268 --> 00:40:42,338
Hurry up.

1267
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:46,138
(Being forced to do push-up)

1268
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:47,267
Cham, cham, cham.

1269
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:49,137
- Okay, hurry up.
- Wait.

1270
00:40:49,138 --> 00:40:50,337
What are you doing?

1271
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:52,748
(Stigmatized as Fashion Muscle)

1272
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:54,477
Cham, cham, cham.

1273
00:40:54,478 --> 00:40:55,478
(Time is up.)

1274
00:40:55,478 --> 00:40:56,478
It's the last one.

1275
00:40:56,518 --> 00:40:57,717
Wait, I can't do it anymore.

1276
00:40:57,718 --> 00:40:59,524
- What are you doing?
- You can't do 500 of them.

1277
00:40:59,548 --> 00:41:01,517
My body is paralyzed.

1278
00:41:01,518 --> 00:41:02,587
(Knocked down)

1279
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:03,858
How many did I do?

1280
00:41:04,718 --> 00:41:05,727
You did 50.

1281
00:41:05,728 --> 00:41:07,458
- I only did 50?
- You won 15 dollars.

1282
00:41:07,658 --> 00:41:08,958
This is very difficult.

1283
00:41:09,198 --> 00:41:10,398
I'm about to throw up.

1284
00:41:11,228 --> 00:41:12,397
You played Cham, Cham, Cham well.

1285
00:41:12,398 --> 00:41:14,297
You did well in the beginning, then suddenly, the pattern changed.

1286
00:41:14,298 --> 00:41:15,667
I feel like vomiting.

1287
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:17,614
- I have no appetite anymore.
- Can you tense up?

1288
00:41:17,638 --> 00:41:18,708
His muscles are pumped up.

1289
00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:22,377
(His muscles are properly pumped up.)

1290
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:24,507
You did 50, so 5 times 3.

1291
00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:26,077
- You won 15 dollars.
- He won 15, and I won 10 dollars.

1292
00:41:26,078 --> 00:41:27,078
A total of 25 dollars.

1293
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:29,347
- You have to win 15 dollars.
- What we have is perfect.

1294
00:41:29,348 --> 00:41:31,468
(They earned half the price of the braised monkfish.)

1295
00:41:31,678 --> 00:41:33,747
If Jong Min earns about 20 dollars, we'll be able to eat it.

1296
00:41:33,748 --> 00:41:35,287
- Right.
- Let's give it a try.

1297
00:41:35,288 --> 00:41:36,318
Okay.

1298
00:41:36,818 --> 00:41:39,228
- Here I go.
- Get ready, set, go.

1299
00:41:39,688 --> 00:41:41,898
- One, two, three, four...
- He's good.

1300
00:41:42,028 --> 00:41:43,128
Cham, cham, cham.

1301
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,928
- Hurry.
- One, two, three, four, five.

1302
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:48,968
Cham, cham, cham.

1303
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,997
No way.

1304
00:41:50,998 --> 00:41:52,344
(He turns his head without his soul.)

1305
00:41:52,368 --> 00:41:53,508
Cham, cham, cham.

1306
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:54,638
(Laughing)

1307
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,707
(A warning)

1308
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:58,077
- Keep doing it.
- Three, four, five.

1309
00:41:58,078 --> 00:41:59,248
Cham, cham, cham.

1310
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,348
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

1311
00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:02,047
Eight, nine, ten.

1312
00:42:02,048 --> 00:42:03,148
Cham, cham, cham.

1313
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:05,588
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1314
00:42:05,718 --> 00:42:07,348
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Okay.

1315
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:09,887
You're doing well.

1316
00:42:09,888 --> 00:42:11,657
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Nice.

1317
00:42:11,658 --> 00:42:13,428
(Jong Min is still moving at a fast speed.)

1318
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:15,128
Cham, cham, cham.

1319
00:42:15,428 --> 00:42:16,428
Sixteen.

1320
00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:18,027
(Winning Cham, Cham, Cham is crucial.)

1321
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:19,098
Cham, cham, cham.

1322
00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:22,637
It's very exhausting when you fail. Right?

1323
00:42:22,638 --> 00:42:23,797
Cham, cham, cham.

1324
00:42:23,798 --> 00:42:24,798
Nice.

1325
00:42:25,038 --> 00:42:26,208
Hurry up.

1326
00:42:26,368 --> 00:42:27,737
Five minutes are almost up.

1327
00:42:27,738 --> 00:42:29,837
(Struggling desperately to earn money)

1328
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,978
- Nice.
- Hurry up.

1329
00:42:32,448 --> 00:42:33,678
Five minutes are almost up.

1330
00:42:34,508 --> 00:42:35,647
Cham, cham, cham.

1331
00:42:35,648 --> 00:42:36,717
(He fails again.)

1332
00:42:36,718 --> 00:42:38,478
Jong Min, lift it up instead of lowering it.

1333
00:42:38,688 --> 00:42:40,247
- Right, raise it up.
- Four.

1334
00:42:40,248 --> 00:42:41,248
You have to raise it.

1335
00:42:41,249 --> 00:42:42,257
(Trying with all his might)

1336
00:42:42,258 --> 00:42:43,418
You have 50 seconds.

1337
00:42:44,158 --> 00:42:46,588
(Straining himself)

1338
00:42:46,728 --> 00:42:48,088
Cham, cham, cham.

1339
00:42:48,258 --> 00:42:50,728
- Twenty-one, twenty-two...
- We're doomed.

1340
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:51,868
Hey.

1341
00:42:52,268 --> 00:42:53,298
Cham, cham, cham.

1342
00:42:54,098 --> 00:42:55,637
Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three...

1343
00:42:55,638 --> 00:42:56,997
(He can't go over 25 during 60 seconds.)

1344
00:42:56,998 --> 00:42:58,508
Twenty-four, twenty-five.

1345
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,238
Cham, cham, cham.

1346
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,908
Twenty-one, twenty-two...

1347
00:43:04,278 --> 00:43:05,477
You have 30 seconds.

1348
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:06,978
I'm almost there.

1349
00:43:07,978 --> 00:43:08,978
Twenty-five.

1350
00:43:09,418 --> 00:43:10,477
Cham, cham, cham.

1351
00:43:10,478 --> 00:43:12,217
(He fails to defend 5 times in a row.)

1352
00:43:12,218 --> 00:43:15,048
- Goodness.
- Use your legs now.

1353
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,957
This is really exhausting.

1354
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:19,828
(He has about 15 seconds left.)

1355
00:43:20,528 --> 00:43:22,658
(Crying)

1356
00:43:23,228 --> 00:43:24,328
Cham, cham, cham.

1357
00:43:25,628 --> 00:43:27,698
(Hang in there, Jong Min.)

1358
00:43:31,668 --> 00:43:33,367
(The mission ends with a roar.)

1359
00:43:33,368 --> 00:43:34,568
Time is up.

1360
00:43:40,278 --> 00:43:41,348
I'm so tired.

1361
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:42,878
I think he did the worst.

1362
00:43:43,778 --> 00:43:45,018
I feel bad for him.

1363
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,918
I feel bad for you, Jong Min.

1364
00:43:47,148 --> 00:43:48,817
- Look at my sweat.
- Let me see.

1365
00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:49,978
- I worked very hard.
- Gosh.

1366
00:43:50,118 --> 00:43:51,157
He worked very hard.

1367
00:43:51,158 --> 00:43:52,158
(He sweated and won 9 dollars.)

1368
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:53,479
His hands are covered with sweat.

1369
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:57,558
As a result, you won 34.5 dollars.

1370
00:43:57,728 --> 00:43:59,128
Isn't it worth spending?

1371
00:43:59,398 --> 00:44:00,497
We just need to spend 15 dollars.

1372
00:44:00,498 --> 00:44:02,597
- May I say one thing?
- Compared to the other team...

1373
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,138
- Okay.
- All right.

1374
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:06,288
Why don't we enjoy our dinner instead?

1375
00:44:06,408 --> 00:44:09,978
Let's have 2 bowls of rice and 2 dishes of kimchi each.

1376
00:44:10,378 --> 00:44:11,378
How much would that be?

1377
00:44:11,379 --> 00:44:14,448
We had close to ten dollars more than the other team.

1378
00:44:14,508 --> 00:44:16,347
- Right.
- It means that we're still winning.

1379
00:44:16,348 --> 00:44:18,388
Even if they don't eat, but they'll definitely eat.

1380
00:44:18,548 --> 00:44:20,348
Okay, let's do this.

1381
00:44:20,618 --> 00:44:21,817
We will...

1382
00:44:21,818 --> 00:44:23,018
close our eyes.

1383
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:25,117
- Let's decide by majority rule.
- Let's be honest.

1384
00:44:25,118 --> 00:44:26,157
I'll follow the majority rule.

1385
00:44:26,158 --> 00:44:27,357
- Say your honest thought.
- Okay.

1386
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:29,797
Close your eyes and show us your choice.

1387
00:44:29,798 --> 00:44:31,757
- Who will check?
- Based on that, we'll order.

1388
00:44:31,758 --> 00:44:33,497
Okay, let's do that.

1389
00:44:33,498 --> 00:44:35,098
- I'll follow the majority rule.
- Okay.

1390
00:44:35,398 --> 00:44:36,468
All right.

1391
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:40,407
If you think that you should eat braised monkfish,

1392
00:44:40,408 --> 00:44:41,538
raise your hands.

1393
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:46,447
I feel like I'm the only one who raised his hands.

1394
00:44:46,448 --> 00:44:47,607
Lower your hands.

1395
00:44:47,608 --> 00:44:48,724
(It feels like he's the only one with raised hands.)

1396
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:50,247
Open your eyes now.

1397
00:44:50,248 --> 00:44:51,917
- In that case...
- Has it been decided?

1398
00:44:51,918 --> 00:44:52,918
Yes.

1399
00:44:53,748 --> 00:44:55,287
I will order the braised monkfish.

1400
00:44:55,288 --> 00:44:56,388
What? Who raised his hand?

1401
00:44:58,118 --> 00:45:00,658
(Actually, he wanted to eat it.)

1402
00:45:00,928 --> 00:45:03,027
We came all the way here. We have to eat it.

1403
00:45:03,028 --> 00:45:04,927
- You earned less than me.
- We came all the way here.

1404
00:45:04,928 --> 00:45:06,298
You earned about 9 to 10 dollars.

1405
00:45:06,828 --> 00:45:08,737
- You should eat a lot.
- We came all the way here.

1406
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:10,297
Look at that. We have to eat it.

1407
00:45:10,298 --> 00:45:12,237
- He's right.
- You can avoid eating black pork...

1408
00:45:12,238 --> 00:45:14,744
on Jeju Island. That's the kind of effort you need on the show.

1409
00:45:14,768 --> 00:45:16,707
Let's bet everything in the next round.

1410
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:17,778
Exactly.

1411
00:45:17,878 --> 00:45:19,108
Joon, trust me.

1412
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,447
Let's enjoy the food. Let's go.

1413
00:45:21,448 --> 00:45:22,848
Let's eat it in a good mood.

1414
00:45:22,948 --> 00:45:24,018
I'm not in a good mood.

1415
00:45:24,548 --> 00:45:28,148
(They ordered it based on majority rule.)

1416
00:45:29,258 --> 00:45:32,087
(Here's the braised monkfish.)

1417
00:45:32,088 --> 00:45:33,257
Aren't you going to eat this?

1418
00:45:33,258 --> 00:45:34,557
(It looks incredible.)

1419
00:45:34,558 --> 00:45:36,727
- It's impossible not to eat it.
- Will you really not eat this?

1420
00:45:36,728 --> 00:45:38,158
The serving size is very generous.

1421
00:45:38,198 --> 00:45:40,867
Oh, my. I see a lot of monkfish.

1422
00:45:40,868 --> 00:45:42,798
They put in such big pieces.

1423
00:45:43,568 --> 00:45:46,088
(The stingy Joon still thinks 50 dollars is too much to spend.)

1424
00:45:46,338 --> 00:45:47,737
I'll enjoy it.

1425
00:45:47,738 --> 00:45:48,738
(Impressed)

1426
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:49,908
My, it smells so good.

1427
00:45:50,478 --> 00:45:52,278
- It's good, isn't it?
- My, it's so good.

1428
00:45:52,908 --> 00:45:53,908
(He has one bite, and that changes his mind.)

1429
00:45:53,909 --> 00:45:55,147
- You try it first, Jong Min.
- Thanks.

1430
00:45:55,148 --> 00:45:56,818
Look at this. It's huge.

1431
00:45:56,978 --> 00:46:00,348
- It seems so plump.
- It's so tasty.

1432
00:46:00,818 --> 00:46:02,988
The monkfish is still steamy.

1433
00:46:04,018 --> 00:46:05,217
My, this is really good.

1434
00:46:05,218 --> 00:46:06,987
How can you refuse to eat this? Am I right?

1435
00:46:06,988 --> 00:46:08,427
Trying this dish in this area is a must.

1436
00:46:08,428 --> 00:46:09,698
The sauce is amazing too.

1437
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:11,257
The fish is so plump and fresh.

1438
00:46:11,258 --> 00:46:13,197
- This is...
- It sure is tasty.

1439
00:46:13,198 --> 00:46:14,628
(Touched)

1440
00:46:15,198 --> 00:46:17,337
If you try just one piece, you can tell.

1441
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:18,614
- It makes me lose my mind.
- Right.

1442
00:46:18,638 --> 00:46:19,868
Oh, my. This is crazy good.

1443
00:46:20,338 --> 00:46:21,407
I can't keep it together.

1444
00:46:21,408 --> 00:46:23,678
- The monkfish itself is very fresh.
- Indeed.

1445
00:46:24,038 --> 00:46:27,208
It must not be frozen monkfish. You didn't use frozen fish, right?

1446
00:46:27,348 --> 00:46:29,017
It's made with fresh monkfish.

1447
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:31,058
- Fresh monkfish. I knew it.
- It's fresh monkfish.

1448
00:46:31,448 --> 00:46:33,447
I can tell the difference clearly. It's so tasty.

1449
00:46:33,448 --> 00:46:35,148
Ma'am, this is amazing. It's the best.

1450
00:46:35,658 --> 00:46:37,017
I didn't know fresh monkfish could be this good.

1451
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:40,028
The fish is very tender. It's really tender and nice.

1452
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:41,228
It's also aromatic.

1453
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,027
And bean sprout. You have to eat it with the fish.

1454
00:46:45,028 --> 00:46:46,474
(Bean sprout, another ingredient that makes braised monkfish special)

1455
00:46:46,498 --> 00:46:48,868
- It's crunchy too.
- Fresh monkfish is different.

1456
00:46:49,298 --> 00:46:51,897
(Crunchy)

1457
00:46:51,898 --> 00:46:53,307
- It's good.
- At some places,

1458
00:46:53,308 --> 00:46:54,937
they put too much bean sprout in braised monkfish.

1459
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:56,354
But here, half of the dish is monkfish.

1460
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:58,098
- This is real braised monkfish.
- Exactly.

1461
00:46:58,508 --> 00:47:00,347
This is the best braised monkfish I've ever had.

1462
00:47:00,348 --> 00:47:01,447
(It's the best braised monkfish Seon Ho has had in his life.)

1463
00:47:01,448 --> 00:47:03,347
Eat a lot, guys. We'll need much energy.

1464
00:47:03,348 --> 00:47:04,617
- We need to eat a lot when we can.
- Right.

1465
00:47:04,618 --> 00:47:07,317
We need to keep our bodies warm so that we feel less cold in water.

1466
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:08,547
- Why would you...
- He thinks we'll dive into water.

1467
00:47:08,548 --> 00:47:10,287
I told you not to say such a thing.

1468
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:11,864
Jong Min, we can avoid diving into water.

1469
00:47:11,888 --> 00:47:13,058
- Okay.
- We can avoid it.

1470
00:47:13,228 --> 00:47:14,427
I really don't want to do it.

1471
00:47:14,428 --> 00:47:16,734
(The thought of going into water in winter terrifies them.)

1472
00:47:16,758 --> 00:47:18,798
- The other team must've eaten too.
- Of course.

1473
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:20,627
Se Yoon wouldn't have been able to resist it.

1474
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:22,574
(They probably ate a nice dish because of Se Yoon?)

1475
00:47:22,598 --> 00:47:24,097
- Isn't it better to eat it?
- Here you go.

1476
00:47:24,098 --> 00:47:25,978
We should eat that. We should eat at least one.

1477
00:47:26,238 --> 00:47:27,508
- Our money...
- Let's eat it.

1478
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:30,438
We'll have a set meal of spicy seafood soup and...

1479
00:47:30,578 --> 00:47:32,177
Rice comes with it, right?

1480
00:47:32,178 --> 00:47:34,947
- They said it came with the soup.
- We're eating food. What a relief.

1481
00:47:34,948 --> 00:47:36,277
You've become optimistic.

1482
00:47:36,278 --> 00:47:37,648
- It's a relief.
- That's good.

1483
00:47:38,448 --> 00:47:40,487
- Hello.
- Hello.

1484
00:47:40,488 --> 00:47:41,887
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hello.

1485
00:47:41,888 --> 00:47:44,887
Oh, my. Sae Ho and Se Yoon, hello. Can't I take a photo with you?

1486
00:47:44,888 --> 00:47:46,627
- We'll do that before we leave.
- Oh, hello, DinDin.

1487
00:47:46,628 --> 00:47:49,258
- Hello.
- You look better in person.

1488
00:47:49,758 --> 00:47:51,028
She's outgoing and cheery.

1489
00:47:51,498 --> 00:47:52,867
I like her fashion style too.

1490
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:54,168
She seems so cool.

1491
00:47:54,328 --> 00:47:56,737
I struggled a lot this morning to do my hair.

1492
00:47:56,738 --> 00:47:57,997
(Laughing)

1493
00:47:57,998 --> 00:47:59,468
(The cool lady)

1494
00:47:59,908 --> 00:48:00,908
(Laughing)

1495
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:02,737
- No wonder it stays up so well.
- Indeed.

1496
00:48:02,738 --> 00:48:03,837
(The voluminous part is what made her struggle.)

1497
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:05,824
Ma'am, please give us lots of food as much as you love us.

1498
00:48:05,848 --> 00:48:07,508
- Of course.
- What?

1499
00:48:08,478 --> 00:48:09,848
(All eyes are on the food.)

1500
00:48:10,978 --> 00:48:13,418
(The pot is filled to the brim with a lot of seafood.)

1501
00:48:13,848 --> 00:48:16,488
(The plump whole octopus looks amazing.)

1502
00:48:16,788 --> 00:48:19,328
(Shrimps with the scent of the sea)

1503
00:48:19,728 --> 00:48:22,328
(Blue crabs, abalones, and various clams)

1504
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:25,458
(The invigorating food that brings the sea to you)

1505
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:28,727
(A meal of spicy seafood soup)

1506
00:48:28,728 --> 00:48:29,867
How do we eat this?

1507
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:31,098
- I'll show you.
- Yes.

1508
00:48:31,938 --> 00:48:34,567
You should start with the octopus. I'll give the oldest one first.

1509
00:48:34,568 --> 00:48:36,277
- Right. Thank you so much.
- Here you go.

1510
00:48:36,278 --> 00:48:37,737
- We should eat it first?
- Yes.

1511
00:48:37,738 --> 00:48:39,678
Or else, the octopus will become tough.

1512
00:48:39,908 --> 00:48:41,477
(He drinks the refreshing broth.)

1513
00:48:41,478 --> 00:48:43,178
Nice. It's refreshing and clean.

1514
00:48:43,748 --> 00:48:45,887
The broth is so tasty. It's really refreshing.

1515
00:48:45,888 --> 00:48:48,048
Where did Jong Min go?

1516
00:48:48,388 --> 00:48:49,517
He went somewhere else to have braised monkfish.

1517
00:48:49,518 --> 00:48:51,288
Oh, gosh. That's not tasty at all.

1518
00:48:52,728 --> 00:48:54,887
(Chuckling)

1519
00:48:54,888 --> 00:48:57,258
My goodness. She's so hilarious.

1520
00:48:57,428 --> 00:48:58,428
She's amazing.

1521
00:48:58,429 --> 00:48:59,898
She's the best.

1522
00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:02,298
She cracked us all up in only a few minutes.

1523
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:03,537
- All right.
- Oh, yes!

1524
00:49:03,538 --> 00:49:05,138
(I'm number 1? I'm on cloud 9.)

1525
00:49:05,468 --> 00:49:07,707
(Her hilarious jokes crack up DinDin the Kid.)

1526
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,937
Among all the local people I've met while filming this show,

1527
00:49:09,938 --> 00:49:11,498
- she's the funniest.
- She's the best.

1528
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:13,477
- You can eat it now.
- Thank you.

1529
00:49:13,478 --> 00:49:15,677
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you for this.

1530
00:49:15,678 --> 00:49:16,917
(Polite)

1531
00:49:16,918 --> 00:49:18,018
It's really good.

1532
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:24,587
- It's so refreshing and tasty.
- My, it's good.

1533
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:26,628
The broth is really amazing.

1534
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:28,187
(Gobbling down the food)

1535
00:49:28,188 --> 00:49:29,328
The broth is so tasty.

1536
00:49:30,028 --> 00:49:31,328
What is the other team doing?

1537
00:49:31,998 --> 00:49:34,368
Can't you tell us if they ate the food or not?

1538
00:49:35,068 --> 00:49:36,268
We can't.

1539
00:49:36,468 --> 00:49:38,468
I'm sure they ate the food.

1540
00:49:38,498 --> 00:49:40,367
I think we could do something like this.

1541
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:42,607
Switching the money we have without checking the amount.

1542
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:43,608
(Sae Ho thinks they'll get a chance to switch money?)

1543
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:44,929
- Yes, that will happen.
- Right.

1544
00:49:44,978 --> 00:49:46,007
They won't agree to do that.

1545
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:47,008
(Even if it happens, the other team won't switch money.)

1546
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:48,289
They have more money than we do.

1547
00:49:49,978 --> 00:49:51,017
This is so good.

1548
00:49:51,018 --> 00:49:52,177
(They love the spicy seafood soup.)

1549
00:49:52,178 --> 00:49:53,318
Awesome. It's so refreshing.

1550
00:49:53,688 --> 00:49:55,517
- Spicy seafood soup is better.
- This is better.

1551
00:49:55,518 --> 00:49:57,088
We didn't try braised monkfish, though.

1552
00:49:57,658 --> 00:50:02,128
(The staff members seem busy for some reason.)

1553
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:04,658
(Hiding something behind her back)

1554
00:50:06,268 --> 00:50:10,198
(She puts something down in front of the entrance.)

1555
00:50:10,268 --> 00:50:12,168
(What the staff member left...)

1556
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:15,168
(is a red envelope that says "money.")

1557
00:50:15,678 --> 00:50:17,377
(Carrying out their plot)

1558
00:50:17,378 --> 00:50:18,948
Come down and hide, everyone.

1559
00:50:19,008 --> 00:50:20,507
- Thank you.
- Thank you. We enjoyed the food.

1560
00:50:20,508 --> 00:50:21,677
We really enjoyed the food.

1561
00:50:21,678 --> 00:50:23,147
(They even hide themselves.)

1562
00:50:23,148 --> 00:50:24,178
It was so good.

1563
00:50:24,248 --> 00:50:26,648
(Rushing)

1564
00:50:26,948 --> 00:50:29,588
(What could be the staff's plan?)

1565
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,127
My, that was a good meal.

1566
00:50:33,128 --> 00:50:34,227
(She picks up the envelope.)

1567
00:50:34,228 --> 00:50:35,587
- They left this here.
- What is that?

1568
00:50:35,588 --> 00:50:37,728
- They just left it lying around.
- Thank you.

1569
00:50:37,928 --> 00:50:40,698
Let's get going. Let's go. Come on.

1570
00:50:41,228 --> 00:50:43,598
(Ambushing the members)

1571
00:50:44,098 --> 00:50:45,808
We found this on the floor. What is this?

1572
00:50:47,408 --> 00:50:48,607
- What's this?
- Turn it upside down, please.

1573
00:50:48,608 --> 00:50:49,928
- Doesn't it say "money?"
- What?

1574
00:50:50,038 --> 00:50:51,318
(Turn the envelope upside down?)

1575
00:50:51,938 --> 00:50:54,047
(You can see a letter if you turn it upside down.)

1576
00:50:54,048 --> 00:50:55,878
(Oyster)

1577
00:50:56,548 --> 00:50:59,218
(The secret of the envelope that the staff left)

1578
00:50:59,518 --> 00:51:02,048
(You can see more strokes if you open the envelope.)

1579
00:51:03,718 --> 00:51:04,718
(Turn it upside down, and you'll see "oyster," the hidden letter.)

1580
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:06,628
- It says "oyster," right?
- What does it mean?

1581
00:51:07,028 --> 00:51:09,027
Se Yoon, who received the oyster envelope,

1582
00:51:09,028 --> 00:51:10,498
will go separately from the others.

1583
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:14,467
(Smiling)

1584
00:51:14,468 --> 00:51:15,568
- What?
- What do you mean?

1585
00:51:16,238 --> 00:51:17,737
- This isn't mine.
- It's just...

1586
00:51:17,738 --> 00:51:20,037
I was just trying to find its owner.

1587
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:21,167
- That's not all.
- Are you the owner?

1588
00:51:21,168 --> 00:51:22,707
That's not all. It was...

1589
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,477
the one that the lady here found. She gave it to Se Yoon.

1590
00:51:24,478 --> 00:51:25,537
- I mean...
- It says "money."

1591
00:51:25,538 --> 00:51:26,884
- I thought it said "money."
- It's "money."

1592
00:51:26,908 --> 00:51:29,377
I opened the envelope, and it was actually "oyster."

1593
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:30,977
(Se Yoon finds it hard to believe.)

1594
00:51:30,978 --> 00:51:32,348
This is so annoying.

1595
00:51:33,988 --> 00:51:36,188
(Whatever it is, it's all good as long as it's not me.)

1596
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:40,087
Hey... Let's not play this game of cloaks and daggers.

1597
00:51:40,088 --> 00:51:41,358
We both know how it goes.

1598
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:43,857
Come on, you're handsome. Let's... All right.

1599
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:46,397
- I'll go, but before that...
- You should go with them.

1600
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:48,097
Come on. Why are you doing this to me?

1601
00:51:48,098 --> 00:51:49,498
Gosh, you guys.

1602
00:51:49,998 --> 00:51:52,237
I saw him holding this envelope and wondered what it was.

1603
00:51:52,238 --> 00:51:53,567
- Come to think of it, - I was just going down the stairs.

1604
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,708
She gave it to me, so she should come with me.

1605
00:51:56,108 --> 00:51:58,068
She found it and gave it to me. I didn't find it.

1606
00:51:58,338 --> 00:51:59,907
- Please close the door.
- Close the door?

1607
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,247
Yes. A good thing will happen to you.

1608
00:52:01,248 --> 00:52:02,748
(Resentful)

1609
00:52:03,518 --> 00:52:04,847
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1610
00:52:04,848 --> 00:52:06,317
We enjoyed the food.

1611
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:07,447
Thank you for the food.

1612
00:52:07,448 --> 00:52:09,217
(There's an envelope in front of the place where Team Jong Min ate.)

1613
00:52:09,218 --> 00:52:11,188
I guess one member from that team will join me.

1614
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:13,357
It'll likely be Joon.

1615
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:15,364
Joon is always the first one to leave after we eat.

1616
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:16,797
It'll be Joon. I'm 100 percent sure.

1617
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:20,098
(Will Joon be the first one to come out as Se Yoon thinks?)

1618
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:24,144
I'm 100 percent sure that it'll be Joon.

1619
00:52:24,168 --> 00:52:26,208
There's no way the others will come out before him.

1620
00:52:27,568 --> 00:52:30,308
(Did he spot the oyster envelope?)

1621
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:31,677
I don't think he saw the envelope.

1622
00:52:31,678 --> 00:52:33,548
(He cares only about how he looks.)

1623
00:52:33,678 --> 00:52:35,198
Go and pick it up. What are you doing?

1624
00:52:35,748 --> 00:52:36,948
Pick it up and get in the car.

1625
00:52:38,548 --> 00:52:41,718
(He's not interested in the envelope at all.)

1626
00:52:42,288 --> 00:52:45,517
(I'm jealous. Joon won't be chosen.)

1627
00:52:45,518 --> 00:52:46,857
Haven't all of them come?

1628
00:52:46,858 --> 00:52:47,927
(The door opens again.)

1629
00:52:47,928 --> 00:52:49,098
Seon Ho is coming out first.

1630
00:52:49,828 --> 00:52:51,028
Seon Ho came out first.

1631
00:52:52,228 --> 00:52:53,508
Seon Ho didn't see the envelope.

1632
00:52:53,998 --> 00:52:55,467
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Take care.

1633
00:52:55,468 --> 00:52:56,737
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

1634
00:52:56,738 --> 00:52:59,608
(Jong Min, who comes out after Seon Ho, also...)

1635
00:52:59,738 --> 00:53:00,967
I don't think he saw it.

1636
00:53:00,968 --> 00:53:02,438
(Did none of them see the envelope?)

1637
00:53:02,508 --> 00:53:04,177
- Did you put it on the ground?
- Yes.

1638
00:53:04,178 --> 00:53:05,178
They all came out already.

1639
00:53:05,178 --> 00:53:06,178
(Lying around)

1640
00:53:06,678 --> 00:53:08,778
(None of them spotted the envelope.)

1641
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,878
(Meanwhile, Director Joo watched them.)

1642
00:53:11,518 --> 00:53:13,447
(We have a problem.)

1643
00:53:13,448 --> 00:53:15,587
(The staff in crisis)

1644
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:16,588
- What should we do?
- What?

1645
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:18,088
Come up with an idea, please.

1646
00:53:18,958 --> 00:53:21,158
What do we do? How should we handle this situation?

1647
00:53:21,588 --> 00:53:23,708
(They have to make the members pick up the envelope.)

1648
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:27,498
(Director Joo comes out.)

1649
00:53:28,298 --> 00:53:30,778
(He picks up the oyster envelope that the members didn't see.)

1650
00:53:31,668 --> 00:53:33,167
Let's do it over again.

1651
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,714
(They decided to attempt for the 2nd time.)

1652
00:53:34,738 --> 00:53:38,178
(They need to lure the members inside naturally.)

1653
00:53:38,908 --> 00:53:40,377
(Walking awkwardly)

1654
00:53:40,378 --> 00:53:42,308
(He seems suspicious!)

1655
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:43,817
(The members)

1656
00:53:43,818 --> 00:53:46,188
(He even hovers around them.)

1657
00:53:46,618 --> 00:53:48,417
(Why is he doing that?)

1658
00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:50,457
- Is it not going as planned?
- It's not going as planned.

1659
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:51,717
Please go back inside.

1660
00:53:51,718 --> 00:53:52,987
- Why?
- Is it taking that team too long?

1661
00:53:52,988 --> 00:53:54,988
No. I think the other team didn't eat the food.

1662
00:53:55,228 --> 00:53:56,797
- Why? What's going on?
- I have no idea.

1663
00:53:56,798 --> 00:53:57,827
- What's wrong? Do we need...
- Sorry?

1664
00:53:57,828 --> 00:53:58,857
- to wait until the next activity?
- Sorry?

1665
00:53:58,858 --> 00:54:00,027
- Is that the case?
- No.

1666
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,727
Hey, come here. Come over here.

1667
00:54:01,728 --> 00:54:02,737
What's going on?

1668
00:54:02,738 --> 00:54:04,767
I think the other team guessed...

1669
00:54:04,768 --> 00:54:07,438
which of us would go out first.

1670
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:10,438
- That's why the brain's ability...
- My gut tells me that.

1671
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:12,877
(Team Kim Jong Min's guess is completely off.)

1672
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:14,448
Jong Min is a genius.

1673
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:15,877
Let's go out together at the same time.

1674
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,047
- Just 1 of us should go.
- Just 1 of us?

1675
00:54:17,048 --> 00:54:18,877
- Joon.
- Hold on a second.

1676
00:54:18,878 --> 00:54:20,247
- Jong Min, you should go.
- I think...

1677
00:54:20,248 --> 00:54:21,317
No. I think they picked you.

1678
00:54:21,318 --> 00:54:22,487
You always leave first after we eat.

1679
00:54:22,488 --> 00:54:24,388
- Right.
- Wait, no. You always stay.

1680
00:54:26,658 --> 00:54:28,328
(Putting it down)

1681
00:54:28,928 --> 00:54:31,658
(The oyster envelope is put down on the ground again.)

1682
00:54:32,028 --> 00:54:34,697
(Any of you, please pick it up.)

1683
00:54:34,698 --> 00:54:36,737
- Let's go!
- Seon Ho, you go first.

1684
00:54:36,738 --> 00:54:39,138
Act natural. There's a 50 percent chance.

1685
00:54:40,008 --> 00:54:42,438
- What's that? "Money?"
- Why did you stop?

1686
00:54:42,468 --> 00:54:45,677
- What? "Money?" It says "money."
- Keep going.

1687
00:54:45,678 --> 00:54:47,677
(He grabbed it!)

1688
00:54:47,678 --> 00:54:48,908
It says "money."

1689
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:51,277
- Let's grab it.
- I found this envelope.

1690
00:54:51,278 --> 00:54:52,894
(Seon Ho picked up the envelope unintentionally.)

1691
00:54:52,918 --> 00:54:53,988
It's not "money."

1692
00:54:54,718 --> 00:54:55,718
What is it?

1693
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:56,918
"Oyster?"

1694
00:54:58,088 --> 00:54:59,187
What's going on?

1695
00:54:59,188 --> 00:55:00,287
(They found a suspicious envelope and are looking around cautiously.)

1696
00:55:00,288 --> 00:55:02,597
- Look around.
- But there's no camera here.

1697
00:55:02,598 --> 00:55:04,958
(Director Joo is happy now.)

1698
00:55:05,528 --> 00:55:07,168
- What's going on? What is it?
- Seon Ho.

1699
00:55:08,298 --> 00:55:09,898
- What?
- Turn the envelope upside down.

1700
00:55:10,038 --> 00:55:11,897
- What is this?
- It says "oyster."

1701
00:55:11,898 --> 00:55:15,007
Seon Ho, who picked up the oyster envelope,

1702
00:55:15,008 --> 00:55:16,408
will go separately from the others.

1703
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:17,938
Is this a good thing?

1704
00:55:18,238 --> 00:55:20,048
I guess I'm going to harvest oysters.

1705
00:55:20,508 --> 00:55:21,648
No way.

1706
00:55:21,848 --> 00:55:24,478
- For real?
- What? Seon Ho.

1707
00:55:24,778 --> 00:55:25,877
What's going on right now?

1708
00:55:25,878 --> 00:55:28,324
Seeing that he's being taken away, it's probably not a good thing.

1709
00:55:28,348 --> 00:55:29,857
Seon Ho, thank you for coming out before us.

1710
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:30,958
Guys!

1711
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:32,458
I'm sorry.

1712
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,428
- Guys.
- I think you'll harvest oysters.

1713
00:55:34,828 --> 00:55:36,527
- Joon.
- Poor thing.

1714
00:55:36,528 --> 00:55:37,528
Seon Ho.

1715
00:55:37,758 --> 00:55:38,797
Guys.

1716
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:40,097
(Guys...)

1717
00:55:40,098 --> 00:55:41,227
- Guys!
- Where are you going?

1718
00:55:41,228 --> 00:55:42,228
Guys!

1719
00:55:43,398 --> 00:55:44,567
(Seon Ho...)

1720
00:55:44,568 --> 00:55:45,568
I love it.

1721
00:55:45,569 --> 00:55:47,207
(Bye, Seon Ho.)

1722
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:48,338
- I'm so relieved.
- I know.

1723
00:55:49,008 --> 00:55:50,237
- This is nice.
- I know, Joon.

1724
00:55:50,238 --> 00:55:52,648
(It's fine as long as it's not me.)

1725
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,048
Do you want to go get some dessert?

1726
00:55:55,648 --> 00:55:56,678
I was like...

1727
00:55:57,178 --> 00:55:58,247
Look how happy they are.

1728
00:55:58,248 --> 00:55:59,248
(Dessert my foot.)

1729
00:55:59,448 --> 00:56:00,717
Goodness.

1730
00:56:00,718 --> 00:56:02,464
(Seon Ho and Se Yoon have to go pick oysters.)

1731
00:56:02,488 --> 00:56:04,488
- Welcome.
- Goodness.

1732
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:06,378
- I'll start driving now.
- All right.

1733
00:56:06,888 --> 00:56:08,157
(They pushed Seon Ho away.)

1734
00:56:08,158 --> 00:56:09,438
Hold on. Let me open the window.

1735
00:56:10,198 --> 00:56:11,198
What is this?

1736
00:56:11,198 --> 00:56:12,198
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho.

1737
00:56:12,199 --> 00:56:13,719
- Se Yoon is here with me.
- Have fun.

1738
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:15,597
They have to pick oysters. I feel bad for them.

1739
00:56:15,598 --> 00:56:17,067
Why is Se Yoon in the van?

1740
00:56:17,068 --> 00:56:18,198
My goodness.

1741
00:56:18,938 --> 00:56:20,808
Se Yoon, are we on our way to pick oysters?

1742
00:56:21,508 --> 00:56:22,638
I have no idea.

1743
00:56:23,038 --> 00:56:24,438
I wish it was honey instead.

1744
00:56:25,078 --> 00:56:26,178
But it's oysters.

1745
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:28,947
- We might have to pick oysters.
- Se Yoon...

1746
00:56:28,948 --> 00:56:30,018
Yes?

1747
00:56:30,548 --> 00:56:32,247
We will be there in 35 minutes.

1748
00:56:32,248 --> 00:56:33,568
(They will arrive in 35 minutes?)

1749
00:56:34,218 --> 00:56:36,018
I guess we are picking oysters. I don't know.

1750
00:56:36,418 --> 00:56:38,418
It's tiring to start working right after eating.

1751
00:56:38,588 --> 00:56:39,788
It's just mentally exhausting.

1752
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,228
(After driving for a while)

1753
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:44,458
We are near the sea.

1754
00:56:44,459 --> 00:56:45,527
(They reached the sea before they knew it.)

1755
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:47,928
We get to watch the sea again when we saw it in the morning.

1756
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:49,798
(He can't help but sigh.)

1757
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:51,239
Have you ever picked oysters before?

1758
00:56:51,968 --> 00:56:53,807
- I just picked the ones...
- I guess you haven't.

1759
00:56:53,808 --> 00:56:55,838
When I went to Geoje Island.

1760
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,308
(Sighing)

1761
00:56:58,438 --> 00:56:59,747
- So you two...
- You guys made it.

1762
00:56:59,748 --> 00:57:00,748
You two made it.

1763
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:01,748
Of course.

1764
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:03,918
So the oysters...

1765
00:57:04,118 --> 00:57:05,854
- Are they picking them?
- They went to pick the oysters?

1766
00:57:05,878 --> 00:57:07,617
I'm sure they are on their way to pick oysters.

1767
00:57:07,618 --> 00:57:08,618
Oysters are in season.

1768
00:57:08,619 --> 00:57:09,757
- Really?
- Yes.

1769
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:11,157
He gets to pick oysters just because he picked that up?

1770
00:57:11,158 --> 00:57:12,798
Are they on their way to the oyster farm?

1771
00:57:12,988 --> 00:57:14,027
That's horrible.

1772
00:57:14,028 --> 00:57:15,228
I feel bad for them.

1773
00:57:15,628 --> 00:57:16,908
How much money do you have left?

1774
00:57:17,198 --> 00:57:18,257
(What?)

1775
00:57:18,258 --> 00:57:19,667
- Us?
- Are we allowed to share that?

1776
00:57:19,668 --> 00:57:20,768
We used up every penny.

1777
00:57:21,398 --> 00:57:23,667
But you guys were... How much did you have?

1778
00:57:23,668 --> 00:57:25,137
Our food was expensive.

1779
00:57:25,138 --> 00:57:27,167
- Ours was expensive too.
- Our dish was 50 dollars.

1780
00:57:27,168 --> 00:57:28,437
- Ours was 50 dollars too.
- Really?

1781
00:57:28,438 --> 00:57:29,737
So we used up about the same amount.

1782
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:30,978
What did you do?

1783
00:57:31,338 --> 00:57:32,748
I did push-ups.

1784
00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:34,307
A hundred of them...

1785
00:57:34,308 --> 00:57:35,907
- Really?
- I did about 200 push-ups.

1786
00:57:35,908 --> 00:57:37,177
- What?
- So this is...

1787
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:39,647
So we just need to work out.

1788
00:57:39,648 --> 00:57:42,008
No, we also played Cham Cham Cham once every five push-ups.

1789
00:57:42,088 --> 00:57:43,857
I did about a few hundred rounds of sit-ups.

1790
00:57:43,858 --> 00:57:47,127
He did a few hundred rounds of sit-ups.

1791
00:57:47,128 --> 00:57:48,228
But he got none.

1792
00:57:48,688 --> 00:57:50,557
- Because we failed Cham Cham Cham.
- You failed that game?

1793
00:57:50,558 --> 00:57:51,997
- So you didn't get any.
- No, we didn't.

1794
00:57:51,998 --> 00:57:53,027
(Jong Min is acting like he didn't earn any money.)

1795
00:57:53,028 --> 00:57:54,597
- What did you do?
- Did you get to eat?

1796
00:57:54,598 --> 00:57:55,897
We just...

1797
00:57:55,898 --> 00:57:57,568
I think we earned about 720 dollars.

1798
00:57:57,938 --> 00:57:59,068
- What?
- That's right.

1799
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:01,667
We earned about 720 dollars.

1800
00:58:01,668 --> 00:58:02,838
- For real?
- Yes.

1801
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,478
- Come on, it doesn't make sense.
- I'm serious.

1802
00:58:05,638 --> 00:58:07,007
So, how much money do you have?

1803
00:58:07,008 --> 00:58:08,008
(A probing move that seems like it will never end)

1804
00:58:08,009 --> 00:58:09,107
- Us?
- Yes.

1805
00:58:09,108 --> 00:58:11,078
I think we have about 50 dollars.

1806
00:58:11,518 --> 00:58:13,587
- That's 55 dollars.
- Right, we had 55 dollars.

1807
00:58:13,588 --> 00:58:14,817
We have five dollars left.

1808
00:58:14,818 --> 00:58:16,887
But we have a lot of money.

1809
00:58:16,888 --> 00:58:18,617
Why is the gap so big?

1810
00:58:18,618 --> 00:58:20,027
We got all the questions correct.

1811
00:58:20,028 --> 00:58:22,227
Our missions helped us earn a lot of money.

1812
00:58:22,228 --> 00:58:23,957
But they can't give you 700 dollars.

1813
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,297
- I know.
- We almost...

1814
00:58:25,298 --> 00:58:26,738
earned our pay by playing the games.

1815
00:58:26,868 --> 00:58:28,527
But that means...

1816
00:58:28,528 --> 00:58:29,868
That is not...

1817
00:58:30,238 --> 00:58:32,037
How can they do this? Is it true?

1818
00:58:32,038 --> 00:58:34,238
That means we have to get in the water for sure.

1819
00:58:34,738 --> 00:58:37,208
You wanted to change the games.

1820
00:58:37,478 --> 00:58:38,978
We should have picked your game.

1821
00:58:39,448 --> 00:58:41,307
This makes no sense.

1822
00:58:41,308 --> 00:58:43,018
- Come on.
- I mean...

1823
00:58:43,518 --> 00:58:45,158
It looks like we're getting in the water.

1824
00:58:45,448 --> 00:58:46,647
I mean the difference in the amount of money...

1825
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,368
So we have to win this time no matter what.

1826
00:58:49,088 --> 00:58:50,587
I really don't want to get in the water.

1827
00:58:50,588 --> 00:58:51,817
It will even hurt my bones.

1828
00:58:51,818 --> 00:58:53,004
(It's minus 1°C right now. I don't want to get in the water.)

1829
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:54,527
I don't think I'm going in.

1830
00:58:54,528 --> 00:58:55,658
Where are we headed?

1831
00:58:55,788 --> 00:58:58,698
We are on our way to a globally rare spot.

1832
00:58:58,728 --> 00:59:00,627
- What?
- We're on our way there.

1833
00:59:00,628 --> 00:59:02,097
We're on a tour then.

1834
00:59:02,098 --> 00:59:04,137
He always treated the winners well.

1835
00:59:04,138 --> 00:59:05,737
- That's right.
- We're a touring team.

1836
00:59:05,738 --> 00:59:07,968
- Benefits have to be different.
- Sure.

1837
00:59:08,438 --> 00:59:09,807
It's only fun that way.

1838
00:59:09,808 --> 00:59:10,837
(The bus just kept...)

1839
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,808
(rolling nonstop.)

1840
00:59:13,178 --> 00:59:14,747
Are we reaching the mountains? Where is this place?

1841
00:59:14,748 --> 00:59:15,807
(They're finally approaching the destination.)

1842
00:59:15,808 --> 00:59:17,147
It's a dinosaur museum.

1843
00:59:17,148 --> 00:59:19,148
A dinosaur museum?

1844
00:59:19,688 --> 00:59:20,748
A dinosaur?

1845
00:59:20,948 --> 00:59:22,187
A dinosaur?

1846
00:59:22,188 --> 00:59:23,287
(Hyenas spotting their prey)

1847
00:59:23,288 --> 00:59:25,317
- A dinosaur?
- Goodness.

1848
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:27,728
Why can't I talk properly? It's driving me crazy.

1849
00:59:28,258 --> 00:59:30,457
Gosh, I love dinosaurs.

1850
00:59:30,458 --> 00:59:31,698
What an unusual experience.

1851
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:34,027
- We get to see their footsteps?
- We'll see Triceratops.

1852
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,228
(Mind-blowing)

1853
00:59:35,428 --> 00:59:36,967
Isn't this that?

1854
00:59:36,968 --> 00:59:38,797
- This is Triceratops.
- Triceratops?

1855
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:40,407
- Yes, Triceratops.
- Triceratops?

1856
00:59:40,408 --> 00:59:42,068
- Where?
- Gosh, look at the left side.

1857
00:59:42,408 --> 00:59:43,537
That's amazing.

1858
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,984
(Where is their destination this time welcomed by dinosaurs?)

1859
00:59:45,008 --> 00:59:46,107
(Sacheon)

1860
00:59:46,108 --> 00:59:47,277
(Traveled to Goseong from Sacheon)

1861
00:59:47,278 --> 00:59:48,578
(Goseong)

1862
00:59:49,048 --> 00:59:50,718
The air is so fresh, goodness.

1863
00:59:51,478 --> 00:59:52,747
We can see the entire ridgeline.

1864
00:59:52,748 --> 00:59:54,517
This place is so pretty.

1865
00:59:54,518 --> 00:59:55,764
(The glittering sea of Goseong welcomes them.)

1866
00:59:55,788 --> 01:00:00,028
It's the dinosaur museum of Goseong, South Gyeongsang Province.

1867
01:00:00,658 --> 01:00:04,028
(A dinosaur museum that feels grand just by looking at it)

1868
01:00:05,198 --> 01:00:09,098
(The sense of reality disappears the moment you enter the place.)

1869
01:00:11,138 --> 01:00:18,038
(It's so real that it seems ready to move at any second.)

1870
01:00:19,648 --> 01:00:23,718
(We invite you to the past of Earth.)

1871
01:00:23,918 --> 01:00:26,588
The scenery is incredible.

1872
01:00:26,818 --> 01:00:28,764
I didn't know they had a place like this in Korea.

1873
01:00:28,788 --> 01:00:29,817
It's so pretty.

1874
01:00:29,818 --> 01:00:31,717
Look at the cliff, it's beautiful.

1875
01:00:31,718 --> 01:00:34,127
(Above the emerald-blue sea, )

1876
01:00:34,128 --> 01:00:35,187
(a picture painted by the waves)

1877
01:00:35,188 --> 01:00:36,498
The view is amazing.

1878
01:00:38,198 --> 01:00:39,318
- Goodness.
- It's the best.

1879
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:40,598
It's so pretty here.

1880
01:00:42,328 --> 01:00:43,498
Dinosaurs!

1881
01:00:43,968 --> 01:00:45,268
It's beautiful.

1882
01:00:46,098 --> 01:00:47,258
Goodness, what is this place?

1883
01:00:47,538 --> 01:00:49,144
It must have cost a lot to build this place.

1884
01:00:49,168 --> 01:00:51,307
(As you enter the place)

1885
01:00:51,308 --> 01:00:52,577
I guess, goodness.

1886
01:00:52,578 --> 01:00:53,947
It's so scary.

1887
01:00:53,948 --> 01:00:55,807
Giganotosaurus? Let's check it out.

1888
01:00:55,808 --> 01:00:58,347
How could such a huge animal go extinct?

1889
01:00:58,348 --> 01:00:59,748
It used to weigh about 6 to 8 tons.

1890
01:01:00,518 --> 01:01:02,117
This is almost like...

1891
01:01:02,118 --> 01:01:03,618
- Was this the actual size?
- Yes.

1892
01:01:04,288 --> 01:01:06,018
It was about 12m to 14m.

1893
01:01:06,058 --> 01:01:07,658
You would die if they stepped on you.

1894
01:01:08,128 --> 01:01:09,728
- Euoplocephalus.
- Right?

1895
01:01:09,858 --> 01:01:12,297
How did they all go extinct at once?

1896
01:01:12,298 --> 01:01:13,527
- This is really...
- Oh, my.

1897
01:01:13,528 --> 01:01:15,067
I can't take this.

1898
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:16,897
- I can't take this, it's too big.
- Quetzalcoatlus.

1899
01:01:16,898 --> 01:01:19,607
It would be so cool if this were flying right now.

1900
01:01:19,608 --> 01:01:21,568
No, it's horrible. This is too horrifying for me.

1901
01:01:21,638 --> 01:01:22,758
Would they snatch us, right?

1902
01:01:23,008 --> 01:01:25,378
- They would snatch us right away.
- They would snatch us.

1903
01:01:26,178 --> 01:01:28,778
I keep seeing dinosaurs here.

1904
01:01:28,878 --> 01:01:31,078
Gosh, this place is well-built.

1905
01:01:31,748 --> 01:01:33,717
(What is this place?)

1906
01:01:33,718 --> 01:01:36,148
So this happens when the water is gone.

1907
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:41,928
(A secret place visible only at low tide)

1908
01:01:43,558 --> 01:01:45,957
Goseong, South Gyeongsang Province is the first place...

1909
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:49,127
in Korea where dinosaur footprints were discovered.

1910
01:01:49,128 --> 01:01:51,697
(Korea's first dinosaur footprint fossil site)

1911
01:01:51,698 --> 01:01:52,797
So the fossils are here?

1912
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:54,284
(Korea's first dinosaur footprint fossil site)

1913
01:01:54,308 --> 01:01:56,878
- Do you see the sunken spots?
- Yes.

1914
01:01:57,238 --> 01:01:58,778
Are these the footprints?

1915
01:01:59,648 --> 01:02:01,978
These are the dinosaur footprint fossils.

1916
01:02:02,778 --> 01:02:04,778
- It's a very famous place.
- Like these?

1917
01:02:05,318 --> 01:02:06,387
That's right.

1918
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:07,417
So they walked here.

1919
01:02:07,418 --> 01:02:10,018
How big were the dinosaurs? They left such huge footprints.

1920
01:02:11,118 --> 01:02:12,218
This is amazing.

1921
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:13,358
It's incredible.

1922
01:02:14,088 --> 01:02:19,328
(The astonishing remnants of Earth's former inhabitants)

1923
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:23,767
These rocks look like table legs.

1924
01:02:23,768 --> 01:02:25,897
- So they're called Sangjogam.
- I see.

1925
01:02:25,898 --> 01:02:27,468
- Yes.
- They're so cool.

1926
01:02:27,768 --> 01:02:28,808
It's splendid.

1927
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:30,277
It's brilliant.

1928
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:32,654
(Sangjogam is a word combination of a table, legs, and rocks.)

1929
01:02:32,678 --> 01:02:33,847
(It's a sea cave, formed by waves eroding the rocks.)

1930
01:02:33,848 --> 01:02:34,907
(It was named as Sangjogam because of its table shape.)

1931
01:02:34,908 --> 01:02:36,007
This is so cool.

1932
01:02:36,008 --> 01:02:37,348
I see a cave over there.

1933
01:02:37,478 --> 01:02:40,288
You see the cave on the right? It's a sea cave.

1934
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:46,058
(Let us get inside too.)

1935
01:02:47,758 --> 01:02:50,598
(A sea cave formed by the waves)

1936
01:02:51,728 --> 01:02:54,298
(Exclamations one after another)

1937
01:02:55,098 --> 01:02:56,167
(It feels different when they see it from the inside.)

1938
01:02:56,168 --> 01:02:57,488
Is this where you take the photo?

1939
01:02:58,298 --> 01:02:59,397
- Gosh.
- It's amazing.

1940
01:02:59,398 --> 01:03:00,668
It's magnificent.

1941
01:03:00,768 --> 01:03:02,167
It's like a masterpiece.

1942
01:03:02,168 --> 01:03:03,277
(A sea cave with the crashing ocean right in front of it)

1943
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:05,678
This is astonishing.

1944
01:03:06,338 --> 01:03:07,347
- I mean, it's beautiful.
- Look at the layers.

1945
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:09,284
So it has been formed over ten thousands of years?

1946
01:03:09,308 --> 01:03:11,948
- It's much longer than that.
- It's beyond that.

1947
01:03:12,478 --> 01:03:13,638
We just live up to 100 years.

1948
01:03:14,418 --> 01:03:15,947
Let us take a photo together. How about the four of us?

1949
01:03:15,948 --> 01:03:17,917
Will it show our faces if we step further back?

1950
01:03:17,918 --> 01:03:19,564
I think we can show our faces if we stand here.

1951
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:21,308
- Let's take a photo here.
- Let's take it.

1952
01:03:22,428 --> 01:03:24,628
One, two, three.

1953
01:03:27,228 --> 01:03:28,267
(Checked in at the Sangjogam photo spot)

1954
01:03:28,268 --> 01:03:30,097
You have to win the games to fully enjoy the show.

1955
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:31,538
It's so beautiful.

1956
01:03:32,238 --> 01:03:34,908
(While the others are enjoying the tour, Se Yoon and Seon Ho...)

1957
01:03:39,038 --> 01:03:40,478
But the owner gave it to me.

1958
01:03:40,678 --> 01:03:41,678
(Se Yoon came to pick oysters because the owner gave it to him.)

1959
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:42,977
She should have been here with me.

1960
01:03:42,978 --> 01:03:44,494
(Se Yoon came to pick oysters because the owner gave it to him.)

1961
01:03:44,518 --> 01:03:46,948
Just throw it away. Why would you carry it?

1962
01:03:47,118 --> 01:03:49,818
As you expected, you two picked the oyster bag.

1963
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:52,417
Se Yoon and Seon Ho.

1964
01:03:52,418 --> 01:03:53,778
Don't you have to give it a twist?

1965
01:03:54,058 --> 01:03:55,058
Are we picking oysters?

1966
01:03:55,188 --> 01:03:56,758
You are selected to pick oysters.

1967
01:03:58,658 --> 01:03:59,768
You didn't give it a twist.

1968
01:04:00,098 --> 01:04:01,397
Let's get on the boat and we'll get going.

1969
01:04:01,398 --> 01:04:02,958
A boat? Why are we getting on the boat?

1970
01:04:02,998 --> 01:04:05,098
- It's oysters. Is it a farm?
- Let's get going.

1971
01:04:06,238 --> 01:04:08,338
We're getting on that boat? That small boat?

1972
01:04:09,238 --> 01:04:10,838
Yes, we'll get going on that small boat.

1973
01:04:11,338 --> 01:04:12,577
(Feeling heavy-hearted)

1974
01:04:12,578 --> 01:04:13,708
Let's get going.

1975
01:04:14,148 --> 01:04:15,207
- Do we just get on the boat?
- Yes.

1976
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:16,688
(Let's get going to get on the boat.)

1977
01:04:16,748 --> 01:04:19,718
The owner gave it to me. But you picked it up.

1978
01:04:20,088 --> 01:04:21,148
The owner gave it to me.

1979
01:04:22,088 --> 01:04:24,858
(We will be back.)

1980
01:04:25,388 --> 01:04:26,388
(The boat has departed without telling the destination.)

1981
01:04:26,389 --> 01:04:27,857
Where are we going? Why are we on a boat?

1982
01:04:27,858 --> 01:04:29,797
I don't get this. Where are we?

1983
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:32,828
If you want to pick oysters,

1984
01:04:33,568 --> 01:04:35,328
you don't pick them from the water.

1985
01:04:35,668 --> 01:04:36,668
Not from the water.

1986
01:04:36,669 --> 01:04:39,697
I guess we're going to some mudflat.

1987
01:04:39,698 --> 01:04:41,207
We're going to an island.

1988
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:42,267
What is this game?

1989
01:04:42,268 --> 01:04:44,214
(Feeling anxious without knowing the destination)

1990
01:04:44,238 --> 01:04:46,578
I saw an island on the map.

1991
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:49,677
We're going quite far.

1992
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:51,977
- The boat is speeding up.
- Right.

1993
01:04:51,978 --> 01:04:54,788
(The boat is speeding without knowing how anxious they are.)

1994
01:04:55,388 --> 01:04:58,058
(Feeling dead serious, on the verge of tears)

1995
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,828
Gosh, I'm cold and sleepy.

1996
01:05:02,158 --> 01:05:03,427
I'm cold, sleepy, and hungry.

1997
01:05:03,428 --> 01:05:05,157
(They surely look like the dropouts.)

1998
01:05:05,158 --> 01:05:06,967
My goodness.

1999
01:05:06,968 --> 01:05:08,097
(The boat is on its way...)

2000
01:05:08,098 --> 01:05:11,437
I shouldn't have picked the bag that belonged to someone else.

2001
01:05:11,438 --> 01:05:12,537
I know.

2002
01:05:12,538 --> 01:05:14,007
- What is this place?
- Goodness.

2003
01:05:14,008 --> 01:05:15,307
(They have reached an island that is 10 minutes away.)

2004
01:05:15,308 --> 01:05:16,907
- We are here.
- Do we get down?

2005
01:05:16,908 --> 01:05:19,637
(The dropouts get down on a small island as Se Yoon expected.)

2006
01:05:19,638 --> 01:05:20,978
We can get down here.

2007
01:05:21,408 --> 01:05:25,478
(What will these two be doing on this small island?)

2008
01:05:28,117 --> 01:05:28,866
Someone harvested the oysters.

2009
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:31,121
- Goodness.
- They're oysters.

2010
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:34,221
(They find a net bag full of oysters.)

2011
01:05:34,761 --> 01:05:37,491
It's an oyster path. It really is an oyster island.

2012
01:05:38,161 --> 01:05:39,161
Goodness.

2013
01:05:39,162 --> 01:05:40,460
(Gulseom)

2014
01:05:40,461 --> 01:05:45,541
(The stragglers arrive at Gulseom.)

2015
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:49,111
(The ground is covered in oysters here.)

2016
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:54,311
(The wild oysters of Gulseom reveal themselves at low tide.)

2017
01:05:54,481 --> 01:05:56,080
They're already working.

2018
01:05:56,081 --> 01:05:58,011
- Where?
- The ladies over there.

2019
01:05:58,881 --> 01:06:00,720
(The locals are already at work during the low tide.)

2020
01:06:00,721 --> 01:06:02,821
The entire island is covered in oysters,

2021
01:06:03,091 --> 01:06:04,590
so it's also called Gulseom.

2022
01:06:04,591 --> 01:06:06,520
- This is Gulseom?
- Yes. Gulseom is the name.

2023
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:07,961
- Gulseom?
- Yes.

2024
01:06:08,461 --> 01:06:09,630
They would be wild oysters.

2025
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:11,291
That's right. They're wild oysters.

2026
01:06:12,331 --> 01:06:15,031
(The oyster storage is hidden underwater at high tide.)

2027
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:18,001
(When the tide goes out, )

2028
01:06:18,471 --> 01:06:22,371
(it appears on the island.)

2029
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:25,681
The oysters here, raised while enduring both high and low tides,

2030
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,610
have a firm and springy flesh, with a strong flavor.

2031
01:06:27,611 --> 01:06:29,410
They taste great.

2032
01:06:29,411 --> 01:06:30,951
- They seem so.
- Yes.

2033
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:34,051
From now on, you'll harvest oysters...

2034
01:06:34,381 --> 01:06:35,891
and earn your allowance.

2035
01:06:36,121 --> 01:06:37,421
- Yes.
- Yes.

2036
01:06:37,891 --> 01:06:40,960
- We'll reimburse you generously...
- Okay.

2037
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:43,090
At 2.5 dollars per 100g,

2038
01:06:43,091 --> 01:06:44,091
based on kimchi-season prices.

2039
01:06:44,092 --> 01:06:45,330
That's quite a lot.

2040
01:06:45,331 --> 01:06:48,330
But only the flesh will be weighed, without the shells.

2041
01:06:48,331 --> 01:06:49,801
- Okay.
- So it's 100g of the flesh.

2042
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:52,401
Can I just eat them too?

2043
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:53,770
But I can't pay you for that.

2044
01:06:53,771 --> 01:06:55,711
- That's all right.
- Okay.

2045
01:06:56,211 --> 01:06:57,770
Yes. You can eat them.

2046
01:06:57,771 --> 01:06:58,910
Okay. That's fine.

2047
01:06:58,911 --> 01:07:00,640
You'll collect the oysters in there.

2048
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:01,750
- Here?
- Yes. You'll remove...

2049
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:02,987
the shells here and weigh them.

2050
01:07:03,011 --> 01:07:04,911
We just need to pick them up.

2051
01:07:05,551 --> 01:07:06,850
Can anyone come here and harvest oysters?

2052
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:08,690
- The fishing village...
- The fishing village manages it.

2053
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,251
Would manage it.

2054
01:07:10,491 --> 01:07:11,650
This is amazing.

2055
01:07:11,651 --> 01:07:13,490
We just need to pick them up.

2056
01:07:13,491 --> 01:07:14,821
It's not hard.

2057
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:19,301
(Se Yoon mostly picks large oysters that suits his size.)

2058
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:21,001
They're lying everywhere.

2059
01:07:21,361 --> 01:07:23,231
They're all wild oysters?

2060
01:07:23,801 --> 01:07:25,801
- You'd really love them, Seon Ho.
- Yes.

2061
01:07:26,301 --> 01:07:28,071
I should take them there and eat them later.

2062
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,541
If you add them in ramyeon... Look at the size!

2063
01:07:32,641 --> 01:07:33,911
Look at the size.

2064
01:07:35,181 --> 01:07:37,080
It's an insane size.

2065
01:07:37,081 --> 01:07:39,121
(The wild oyster is as large as a farm-raised one.)

2066
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:40,581
Amazing.

2067
01:07:41,021 --> 01:07:42,091
Goodness.

2068
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:44,920
(He digs...)

2069
01:07:44,921 --> 01:07:47,791
(and digs.)

2070
01:07:48,161 --> 01:07:49,760
It's really big.

2071
01:07:49,761 --> 01:07:51,461
(It's like a treasure hunt.)

2072
01:07:51,661 --> 01:07:53,101
This is fun.

2073
01:07:53,901 --> 01:07:54,931
It's therapeutic.

2074
01:07:56,231 --> 01:08:00,641
(They find an unexpected moment of healing in Gulseom.)

2075
01:08:02,671 --> 01:08:04,311
This is crazy.

2076
01:08:07,281 --> 01:08:11,251
(They silently harvest the oysters.)

2077
01:08:11,651 --> 01:08:13,250
This one is really big.

2078
01:08:13,251 --> 01:08:15,851
(A special straggler experience in Gulseom surrounded by oysters)

2079
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:19,961
(They keep harvesting the oysters.)

2080
01:08:20,491 --> 01:08:22,931
(It's a hard job where they have to keep bending their back.)

2081
01:08:22,961 --> 01:08:25,301
(They're only looking at the ground.)

2082
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:28,631
(Panting)

2083
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,801
(Breathing)

2084
01:08:30,871 --> 01:08:31,971
My back hurts.

2085
01:08:33,871 --> 01:08:35,100
(The healing moment was brief. He frowns shortly after.)

2086
01:08:35,101 --> 01:08:36,441
Right. My back hurts.

2087
01:08:38,011 --> 01:08:39,081
My back.

2088
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:44,341
(Even if my back hurts, as long as I can skip getting in the water...)

2089
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:46,720
It's heavy.

2090
01:08:46,721 --> 01:08:48,597
(There's no way being left behind could be healing.)

2091
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:49,621
Goodness.

2092
01:08:51,451 --> 01:08:53,891
(The net is quite full already.)

2093
01:08:54,221 --> 01:08:56,931
- It's heavy. Should I take these?
- Shall we?

2094
01:08:57,231 --> 01:08:59,631
- We'll take them.
- Let's take them there.

2095
01:09:00,601 --> 01:09:01,730
Let's take them.

2096
01:09:01,731 --> 01:09:04,071
(Panting)

2097
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:07,070
This isn't the problem.

2098
01:09:07,071 --> 01:09:08,071
- Shucking them is the problem.
- Yes.

2099
01:09:08,072 --> 01:09:10,611
Shucking them without harming them is a skill.

2100
01:09:11,171 --> 01:09:12,241
My back.

2101
01:09:12,841 --> 01:09:14,581
- My clothes are all torn.
- Right.

2102
01:09:16,311 --> 01:09:18,211
(Even if it's hard, they have to make money.)

2103
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:22,551
(If you tap the oyster's opening to open the shell, )

2104
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,721
(the wild oyster appears!)

2105
01:09:28,361 --> 01:09:29,791
Right!

2106
01:09:32,061 --> 01:09:34,301
(The dazzling appearance of the wild oyster)

2107
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:37,601
(Hard Worker Se Yoon is shucking the oysters well.)

2108
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,971
Okay.

2109
01:09:44,241 --> 01:09:45,281
(Earning 1 oyster)

2110
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:48,551
I'm so good at this.

2111
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:51,281
(Meanwhile, Seon Ho, the seafood lover...)

2112
01:09:51,311 --> 01:09:52,920
(Seon Ho's camera)

2113
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:54,681
It's not working so well.

2114
01:09:56,451 --> 01:09:58,091
It fell down again.

2115
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,261
(It doesn't seem easy for Seon Ho.)

2116
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:06,700
(Unlike Seon Ho, Se Yoon is harvesting the oysters quickly.)

2117
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:07,701
It's big.

2118
01:10:08,301 --> 01:10:10,900
There's an incredible thrill when it comes out as a whole.

2119
01:10:10,901 --> 01:10:11,901
Right.

2120
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:13,861
But it's not easy to get it out as a whole.

2121
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:18,711
It burst again. Why does it keep bursting?

2122
01:10:21,341 --> 01:10:23,011
You need skills for sure,

2123
01:10:23,411 --> 01:10:24,851
but you also need some strength.

2124
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:28,481
(He opens the shell with his strength...)

2125
01:10:29,821 --> 01:10:33,121
(and puts it safely in the basket.)

2126
01:10:33,691 --> 01:10:37,131
(He cracks the opening of hard oysters with his strength.)

2127
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:40,300
(Se Yoon's camera)

2128
01:10:40,301 --> 01:10:41,401
(Earning 1 oyster)

2129
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:44,830
(A combination of careful observation...)

2130
01:10:44,831 --> 01:10:49,041
(and delicate hand skills)

2131
01:10:53,011 --> 01:10:55,411
(Se Yoon's oysters have piled up high.)

2132
01:10:55,481 --> 01:10:56,980
You're really good at such things.

2133
01:10:56,981 --> 01:10:59,221
Right. I'm good at simple labor without talking.

2134
01:11:00,121 --> 01:11:01,850
This also didn't come out well.

2135
01:11:01,851 --> 01:11:03,590
(It's still hard for Seon Ho.)

2136
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:05,250
(Seon Ho's camera)

2137
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:07,061
(Slipping)

2138
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:09,560
It's not easy to harvest it whole.

2139
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:11,507
(At this rate, their reimbursement could be quite different.)

2140
01:11:11,531 --> 01:11:15,401
(They're at different skill levels, but they're both doing their best.)

2141
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:19,541
Goodness.

2142
01:11:21,101 --> 01:11:23,341
(It's not easy to harvest oysters.)

2143
01:11:23,511 --> 01:11:25,681
(Hitting)

2144
01:11:26,511 --> 01:11:30,281
(The island is filled with oyster shucking sounds.)

2145
01:11:33,181 --> 01:11:37,321
(Seon Ho also silently focuses on shucking the oysters.)

2146
01:11:37,621 --> 01:11:39,260
It makes me go silent.

2147
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:41,291
I know. It makes me focus.

2148
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:45,601
(A tough, repetitive work of shucking and storing oysters)

2149
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:48,361
(While the stragglers are striving to earn money)

2150
01:11:49,031 --> 01:11:52,440
(What reimbursement mission will go on at the dinosaur museum?)

2151
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:53,601
Everyone.

2152
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:56,010
Have you looked around carefully?

2153
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:58,171
- Yes.
- What?

2154
01:11:58,271 --> 01:12:00,231
You should have told us to look around carefully.

2155
01:12:01,041 --> 01:12:02,611
I just looked around.

2156
01:12:04,811 --> 01:12:06,250
Why are you doing this?

2157
01:12:06,251 --> 01:12:07,421
Everyone.

2158
01:12:07,881 --> 01:12:10,721
The mission that will be held at the dinosaur museum...

2159
01:12:16,191 --> 01:12:18,091
is Quiz Expedition Dinosaur World.

2160
01:12:18,631 --> 01:12:22,271
(The opening brings back memories.)

2161
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,470
- Mysterious world - Mysterious world

2162
01:12:24,471 --> 01:12:26,241
(Quiz Expedition Dinosaur World)

2163
01:12:26,671 --> 01:12:29,171
In this mission,

2164
01:12:29,671 --> 01:12:32,181
a reimbursement voucher is at stake.

2165
01:12:32,711 --> 01:12:35,311
We'd have to secure them.

2166
01:12:35,511 --> 01:12:37,581
We'll definitely use the voucher.

2167
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:39,580
Okay.

2168
01:12:39,581 --> 01:12:40,881
(Is that right?)

2169
01:12:41,051 --> 01:12:44,621
I'll give you various questions about dinosaurs.

2170
01:12:44,721 --> 01:12:46,260
Every time you get a question correct,

2171
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,991
you'll get one cute dinosaur doll.

2172
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,331
It brings back old memories.

2173
01:12:51,491 --> 01:12:55,100
The team that wins more dinosaur dolls wins.

2174
01:12:55,101 --> 01:12:58,101
- Okay.
- I really liked dinosaurs as a kid.

2175
01:12:58,671 --> 01:13:01,170
- If you don't know the answer, - Yes.

2176
01:13:01,171 --> 01:13:02,710
You can look around...

2177
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,210
- We can run and find the answers.
- and find the answers.

2178
01:13:05,211 --> 01:13:07,711
I'll show you the first question.

2179
01:13:08,281 --> 01:13:10,911
(Fully focusing)

2180
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:13,221
One, two, three!

2181
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:14,850
What is that?

2182
01:13:14,851 --> 01:13:18,990
This is a drawing of a dinosaur drawn by a four-year-old.

2183
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:22,491
- Okay.
- What's the name of this dinosaur?

2184
01:13:23,561 --> 01:13:25,390
- What is this?
- Goodness.

2185
01:13:25,391 --> 01:13:26,430
Are you kidding me?

2186
01:13:26,431 --> 01:13:28,460
- What is this?
- What is this?

2187
01:13:28,461 --> 01:13:29,501
DinDin!

2188
01:13:30,071 --> 01:13:31,301
Triceratops?

2189
01:13:31,371 --> 01:13:32,441
Incorrect!

2190
01:13:33,401 --> 01:13:34,640
What is that?

2191
01:13:34,641 --> 01:13:36,911
(They head to find the answer.)

2192
01:13:38,711 --> 01:13:40,380
What's that one on the left?

2193
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:42,281
(Lee Joon heads to the opposite side.)

2194
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:46,881
(They're spreading out to find the answer.)

2195
01:13:47,721 --> 01:13:49,990
(Jong Min and Sae Ho reaches the top first.)

2196
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:51,121
I can't tell.

2197
01:13:55,421 --> 01:13:57,730
Euoplocephalus.

2198
01:13:57,731 --> 01:14:00,731
(Jong Min found a dinosaur that looks similar.)

2199
01:14:01,161 --> 01:14:02,171
Joon!

2200
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:04,071
Joon!

2201
01:14:04,871 --> 01:14:06,640
(He gets a call.)

2202
01:14:06,641 --> 01:14:07,700
Yes?

2203
01:14:07,701 --> 01:14:10,371
Euoplocephalus.

2204
01:14:10,471 --> 01:14:12,040
Euoplocephalus.

2205
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:13,240
Euoplocephalus.

2206
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:15,750
Euoplocephalus?

2207
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:17,581
(It's a difficult name to tell on the call.)

2208
01:14:18,051 --> 01:14:19,420
- DinDin!
- Lee Joon.

2209
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:20,520
I said it first.

2210
01:14:20,521 --> 01:14:21,720
- DinDin!
- Lee Joon.

2211
01:14:21,721 --> 01:14:22,820
I said it first.

2212
01:14:22,821 --> 01:14:24,721
Oenupitalosaurus?

2213
01:14:25,191 --> 01:14:26,390
Could you say that again?

2214
01:14:26,391 --> 01:14:27,791
Incorrect!

2215
01:14:27,921 --> 01:14:29,160
You have to say it after ending the call.

2216
01:14:29,161 --> 01:14:31,641
You shouldn't say it after him. You have to memorize the name.

2217
01:14:32,061 --> 01:14:33,860
- Yes?
- One more time.

2218
01:14:33,861 --> 01:14:35,831
Euoplocephalus.

2219
01:14:35,901 --> 01:14:37,830
Euoplocephalus?

2220
01:14:37,831 --> 01:14:38,901
Cephalus.

2221
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,641
Euoplocephalus.

2222
01:14:43,441 --> 01:14:45,271
- "Euoplocephalus."
- Yes.

2223
01:14:46,581 --> 01:14:47,611
Correct.

2224
01:14:48,081 --> 01:14:49,381
Sae Ho!

2225
01:14:51,281 --> 01:14:52,951
Where was that?

2226
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,921
(You went past it.)

2227
01:14:56,891 --> 01:14:58,190
Was that the right answer?

2228
01:14:58,191 --> 01:15:00,620
- Yes.
- Euoplocephalus?

2229
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:01,621
Yes.

2230
01:15:02,191 --> 01:15:04,191
This cute drawing...

2231
01:15:04,531 --> 01:15:07,500
was drawn by Niccolo, the four-year-old.

2232
01:15:07,501 --> 01:15:08,631
- Really?
- Really?

2233
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,271
(I worked hard to draw it.)

2234
01:15:11,301 --> 01:15:13,040
- Gosh!
- Really?

2235
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,070
(The uncle's heart is melting down.)

2236
01:15:14,071 --> 01:15:15,141
It's his nephew?

2237
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:18,610
- Gosh!
- Niccolo is terrible at drawing.

2238
01:15:18,611 --> 01:15:19,840
He's just four years old.

2239
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:21,140
He must have drawn it while thinking about DinDin.

2240
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:22,680
- "Uncle."
- Right.

2241
01:15:22,681 --> 01:15:24,881
Gosh, he needs to attend an art academy.

2242
01:15:24,951 --> 01:15:25,981
Gosh!

2243
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:29,951
(The details can be seen after hearing about the drawing.)

2244
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:31,190
Are you happy?

2245
01:15:31,191 --> 01:15:33,561
(Thank you for your drawing, Niccolo!)

2246
01:15:33,691 --> 01:15:35,020
We will begin, everyone.

2247
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:38,831
This is the shadow of a certain type of dinosaur.

2248
01:15:39,931 --> 01:15:42,801
What is the name of this dinosaur?

2249
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:44,831
I know!

2250
01:15:44,971 --> 01:15:46,601
Langbeosaurus.

2251
01:15:46,801 --> 01:15:48,540
- Is that the right pronunciation?
- Is that the right pronunciation?

2252
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:50,070
- Be sure about it.
- Come on.

2253
01:15:50,071 --> 01:15:51,771
- "Beo."
- "Beo?"

2254
01:15:52,111 --> 01:15:53,610
- Incorrect!
- That's not it?

2255
01:15:53,611 --> 01:15:55,241
- Lee Joon!
- What?

2256
01:15:55,611 --> 01:15:57,511
Langbeusaurus.

2257
01:15:57,751 --> 01:15:59,180
- Incorrect!
- Run!

2258
01:15:59,181 --> 01:16:00,650
Run! Give me a call!

2259
01:16:00,651 --> 01:16:01,881
(Zooming)

2260
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:03,391
Call me, Joon!

2261
01:16:04,321 --> 01:16:06,721
(Sprinting to find the dinosaur)

2262
01:16:08,091 --> 01:16:09,131
(Screaming)

2263
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:10,461
Gosh, this is so exhausting!

2264
01:16:11,331 --> 01:16:14,161
"Baryonyx."

2265
01:16:14,531 --> 01:16:17,531
(Sae Ho heads toward the end as he seems to have seen it.)

2266
01:16:18,401 --> 01:16:20,961
(He spots a dinosaur that looks like the one from the question.)

2267
01:16:21,541 --> 01:16:23,871
(He returns quickly after checking its name.)

2268
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:26,041
(Joon belatedly spots it.)

2269
01:16:26,581 --> 01:16:28,811
(He quickly calls Jong Min.)

2270
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:30,911
- "Lang?"
- Okay!

2271
01:16:31,981 --> 01:16:35,051
- Hello?
- It's "Lambeosaurus" as in "Lamb."

2272
01:16:35,181 --> 01:16:38,151
- It's a U?
- It's "Lambeosaurus" as in "Lamb.

2273
01:16:38,351 --> 01:16:39,420
- I got it!
- I got it!

2274
01:16:39,421 --> 01:16:40,960
- I got it!
- I was faster!

2275
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:42,631
(He manages to steal the answer.)

2276
01:16:42,691 --> 01:16:44,591
Lambeusaurus!

2277
01:16:45,231 --> 01:16:46,701
DinDin, you are incorrect.

2278
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:49,330
- Jong Min!
- Go ahead.

2279
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:51,501
Lambeosaurus.

2280
01:16:52,001 --> 01:16:53,540
- Correct!
- Yes!

2281
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:54,541
I didn't bring my phone.

2282
01:16:54,542 --> 01:16:55,810
- You should've called me.
- Yes!

2283
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:57,171
- I didn't bring my phone.
- Gosh!

2284
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,581
(This is the fun of playing cheap.)

2285
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,380
(The answer is...)

2286
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:03,651
(Lambeosaurus.)

2287
01:17:03,811 --> 01:17:05,350
You said "Langbeo."

2288
01:17:05,351 --> 01:17:06,480
It was "Lamb."

2289
01:17:06,481 --> 01:17:07,781
It was "Lamb?"

2290
01:17:08,451 --> 01:17:10,791
(Team Kim Jong Min is 2 points ahead.)

2291
01:17:10,951 --> 01:17:13,020
Here's the next question.

2292
01:17:13,021 --> 01:17:15,020
How much does Se Yoon weigh?

2293
01:17:15,021 --> 01:17:16,730
- I know! He's 120kg!
- He's 126kg.

2294
01:17:16,731 --> 01:17:18,730
- He's around 120kg, right?
- Yes.

2295
01:17:18,731 --> 01:17:20,230
At the later stages of the Cretaceous,

2296
01:17:20,231 --> 01:17:23,371
there was a pterodactyl that was heavy as Se Yoon that flew around.

2297
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:26,970
It weighed around 100kg to 200kg.

2298
01:17:26,971 --> 01:17:30,241
What is the name of the biggest pterodactyl in history?

2299
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:31,671
(Getting up)

2300
01:17:31,911 --> 01:17:33,181
Lee Joon!

2301
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:35,811
(DinDin starts running as he doesn't know.)

2302
01:17:35,881 --> 01:17:38,781
Lee Joon! Quetzalcoatlus.

2303
01:17:39,481 --> 01:17:41,280
- "Quetzalco?"
- "Atlus."

2304
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:42,450
- "Atlus?"
- Yes.

2305
01:17:42,451 --> 01:17:43,591
Just run!

2306
01:17:44,321 --> 01:17:45,891
(That can't be the answer.)

2307
01:17:46,121 --> 01:17:47,121
Correct.

2308
01:17:47,821 --> 01:17:48,860
Run!

2309
01:17:48,861 --> 01:17:50,030
(Feeling proud)

2310
01:17:50,031 --> 01:17:51,060
Really?

2311
01:17:51,061 --> 01:17:52,661
(Disappointed)

2312
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:53,801
Did you already know that one?

2313
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:55,200
- Nice one!
- I memorized it on my back.

2314
01:17:55,201 --> 01:17:56,601
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2315
01:17:56,871 --> 01:18:00,671
(He memorized Quetzalcoatlus on his way back.)

2316
01:18:00,871 --> 01:18:02,170
- This feels great.
- Gosh!

2317
01:18:02,171 --> 01:18:04,541
- I'm the brain of this show.
- They're no match.

2318
01:18:04,771 --> 01:18:05,780
They're no match.

2319
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:07,221
There are still many questions left.

2320
01:18:07,481 --> 01:18:09,251
All right. Here's the next question.

2321
01:18:09,381 --> 01:18:11,781
Sandia National Laboratories and...

2322
01:18:11,951 --> 01:18:14,020
New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in the US...

2323
01:18:14,021 --> 01:18:16,020
managed to recreate the cry...

2324
01:18:16,021 --> 01:18:18,720
of the Parasaurolophus,

2325
01:18:18,721 --> 01:18:19,820
a dinosaur with a blue crown on its head.

2326
01:18:19,821 --> 01:18:20,821
Right.

2327
01:18:20,822 --> 01:18:22,660
Out of the cries that will be played,

2328
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:26,631
which one is the real cry of the Parasaurolophus?

2329
01:18:26,801 --> 01:18:28,101
Here's number one.

2330
01:18:28,901 --> 01:18:30,501
(Number one)

2331
01:18:30,801 --> 01:18:33,801
(Focusing)

2332
01:18:33,901 --> 01:18:35,040
- This sounds like a truck.
- What could it be?

2333
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:36,171
What?

2334
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:37,540
(This one doesn't sound like a dinosaur.)

2335
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:38,840
This one doesn't sound like a dinosaur.

2336
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:40,381
All right. Here's number two.

2337
01:18:42,111 --> 01:18:43,980
- Someone made this sound!
- Oh, come on!

2338
01:18:43,981 --> 01:18:45,210
(Why does it sound familiar?)

2339
01:18:45,211 --> 01:18:47,050
- This is Se Yoon!
- This one is a bit too much.

2340
01:18:47,051 --> 01:18:48,551
If a dinosaur cries like that,

2341
01:18:49,451 --> 01:18:50,890
it won't be intimidating at all.

2342
01:18:50,891 --> 01:18:52,321
All right. Number three.

2343
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:55,421
Is this also Se Yoon?

2344
01:18:55,891 --> 01:18:57,591
- It's Se Yoon.
- It sounds like a pig.

2345
01:18:58,391 --> 01:19:00,201
And here's number four.

2346
01:19:01,261 --> 01:19:02,871
(Startled)

2347
01:19:02,901 --> 01:19:05,300
It's this one.

2348
01:19:05,301 --> 01:19:06,577
(This one finally sounds like a dinosaur.)

2349
01:19:06,601 --> 01:19:07,671
Number five.

2350
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:11,111
Gosh.

2351
01:19:11,841 --> 01:19:13,641
- This one is scary.
- This one is scary.

2352
01:19:14,881 --> 01:19:16,580
This would be really scary to actually hear.

2353
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:17,651
Right.

2354
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:20,171
It sounds really scary. It sounds like a monster.

2355
01:19:20,681 --> 01:19:21,751
Number six.

2356
01:19:24,951 --> 01:19:26,821
(This one sounds like a dinosaur as well.)

2357
01:19:26,961 --> 01:19:28,991
- I'll tell you.
- It sounds like number four.

2358
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:33,161
Which one is the cry of the Parasaurolophus?

2359
01:19:33,761 --> 01:19:34,761
Lee Joon!

2360
01:19:34,961 --> 01:19:36,477
- I got it!
- Should we go with number five?

2361
01:19:36,501 --> 01:19:38,171
- Number 4.
- Isn't it number 5?

2362
01:19:39,771 --> 01:19:41,641
- Number four?
- We will get a chance.

2363
01:19:42,571 --> 01:19:44,051
- Is that the answer?
- Okay. DinDin!

2364
01:19:44,741 --> 01:19:46,417
- Is that the answer?
- Joon, you are correct.

2365
01:19:46,441 --> 01:19:49,040
This is crazy. What's with you?

2366
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:50,241
(He got this right in one go?)

2367
01:19:50,381 --> 01:19:51,580
How did you get that right?

2368
01:19:51,581 --> 01:19:53,381
Gosh, I'm a dinosaur expert.

2369
01:19:53,551 --> 01:19:55,651
- This is why I chose number four.
- Right.

2370
01:19:55,721 --> 01:19:57,350
While doing my research on dinosaurs,

2371
01:19:57,351 --> 01:19:59,220
I noticed that the actual cries of dinosaurs...

2372
01:19:59,221 --> 01:20:00,620
sounded quite clear.

2373
01:20:00,621 --> 01:20:04,130
They sounded sharp and squeaky.

2374
01:20:04,131 --> 01:20:05,901
Number four felt that way.

2375
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:08,360
That was why I didn't expect it to be a low sound.

2376
01:20:08,361 --> 01:20:09,901
He's pretending to know everything.

2377
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:13,171
Can we hear number four again?

2378
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:14,300
(This is the restored sound of the Parasaurolophus cry.)

2379
01:20:14,301 --> 01:20:16,141
- Right.
- It goes up.

2380
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:19,011
They restored this sound?

2381
01:20:19,611 --> 01:20:23,711
This is the only dinosaur cry that was restored scientifically.

2382
01:20:24,251 --> 01:20:27,080
The skull fossil of the dinosaur went through a 3D scan...

2383
01:20:27,081 --> 01:20:29,490
and the cry was made by a computer simulation.

2384
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:30,991
(Fascinated)

2385
01:20:31,221 --> 01:20:32,560
We thought you would get confused.

2386
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:35,121
You were right about it being Se Yoon for number two.

2387
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:36,931
- Right. It was Se Yoon for sure.
- Right?

2388
01:20:36,961 --> 01:20:39,361
(It's the sound of Se Yoon making the sound of a boat horn.)

2389
01:20:39,461 --> 01:20:40,700
(Dumbfounded)

2390
01:20:40,701 --> 01:20:42,330
He might've been a dinosaur in the past.

2391
01:20:42,331 --> 01:20:43,370
What about number three?

2392
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:44,730
- Number three?
- Wasn't that Se Yoon as well?

2393
01:20:44,731 --> 01:20:46,341
Number three was a hippo.

2394
01:20:48,041 --> 01:20:50,541
(Don't get it confused for it to be a pig.)

2395
01:20:50,911 --> 01:20:53,681
(Number 1 was the sound of a boat horn.)

2396
01:20:53,841 --> 01:20:57,751
(The scary sound of number 5 was a whale.)

2397
01:20:57,911 --> 01:21:01,681
(Number 6 was the sound of a horn.)

2398
01:21:01,821 --> 01:21:03,421
They all sounded like a dinosaur.

2399
01:21:03,891 --> 01:21:06,190
- Do we have one point left?
- You just got one right.

2400
01:21:06,191 --> 01:21:07,320
It's over if they get one more right.

2401
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:08,461
Right.

2402
01:21:08,721 --> 01:21:10,291
We should go for a two-pointer.

2403
01:21:10,391 --> 01:21:11,490
Will you go for a two-pointer?

2404
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:13,330
- No!
- Come on!

2405
01:21:13,331 --> 01:21:15,260
- You're way ahead!
- No. This is about diving in.

2406
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:17,130
- You're better than us.
- I'm sorry.

2407
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:18,731
Here's the next question.

2408
01:21:19,101 --> 01:21:21,270
Now, the accurate pronunciation of "Dinosaur..."

2409
01:21:21,271 --> 01:21:22,611
will be given three times.

2410
01:21:23,171 --> 01:21:26,281
Dinosaur.

2411
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:28,541
- Here's the question.
- What?

2412
01:21:28,641 --> 01:21:31,451
How many times will "Dinosaur" appear?

2413
01:21:31,811 --> 01:21:33,881
(Try to answer the question with them.)

2414
01:21:37,891 --> 01:21:39,891
(What?)

2415
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:42,691
(Forced laughter)

2416
01:21:42,891 --> 01:21:46,961
(They fully focus with their ears.)

2417
01:21:47,201 --> 01:21:49,161
(Confused)

2418
01:21:51,201 --> 01:21:53,900
- I got it.
- What was that?

2419
01:21:53,901 --> 01:21:55,840
- Why was "Gong Yoo" there?
- I got it.

2420
01:21:55,841 --> 01:21:57,240
- I got it.
- Let's let them go first.

2421
01:21:57,241 --> 01:21:59,041
- "Gong Yoo."
- I'm a DJ.

2422
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:01,381
- Four times.
- That was what I got too.

2423
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:02,650
- Incorrect!
- Lee Joon!

2424
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:04,051
- Six times.
- Three times.

2425
01:22:04,351 --> 01:22:05,711
- What?
- Three is incorrect!

2426
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:07,981
- Shall we play it for you again?
- Okay.

2427
01:22:08,551 --> 01:22:10,351
Here it comes. Listen carefully.

2428
01:22:10,451 --> 01:22:12,551
How many times will "Dinosaur" appear?

2429
01:22:12,891 --> 01:22:15,190
Dinosaur, dinosaur, shared,

2430
01:22:15,191 --> 01:22:17,531
ggonyong, kuwongnyong, dinosaur,

2431
01:22:17,561 --> 01:22:19,700
gonyong, gongnyung, gongneung,

2432
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:21,900
kuonyong, gonnyung, dinosaur,

2433
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:23,970
shared, gonnyong, ggonyong,

2434
01:22:23,971 --> 01:22:26,100
military, ggowonyong, dinosaur,

2435
01:22:26,101 --> 01:22:28,170
gongneung, gonryong, shared,

2436
01:22:28,171 --> 01:22:30,271
dinosaur, ggonnyong, gowonyong.

2437
01:22:30,311 --> 01:22:32,140
- I got it!
- I got it!

2438
01:22:32,141 --> 01:22:33,311
- Sae Ho.
- Seven times.

2439
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:35,081
Right. I got seven as well.

2440
01:22:35,611 --> 01:22:37,281
- Incorrect!
- I got it!

2441
01:22:37,981 --> 01:22:39,451
(It's Team Kim Jong Min's chance.)

2442
01:22:39,651 --> 01:22:40,751
Six times!

2443
01:22:41,751 --> 01:22:42,791
Correct!

2444
01:22:43,721 --> 01:22:44,721
Correct!

2445
01:22:45,021 --> 01:22:46,921
(Going wild)

2446
01:22:47,021 --> 01:22:48,320
It was six.

2447
01:22:48,321 --> 01:22:49,607
(Team No Pain No DinDin loses by 0 to 5.)

2448
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:51,360
- Yes!
- Gosh, we're amazing!

2449
01:22:51,361 --> 01:22:52,391
(A rare shutout)

2450
01:22:53,031 --> 01:22:54,231
It was a complete loss.

2451
01:22:55,061 --> 01:22:57,331
- I'll give this to Niccola.
- It's Niccolo!

2452
01:22:58,071 --> 01:23:00,101
Why do you keep calling him Niccola?

2453
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:01,770
It's Niccolo!

2454
01:23:01,771 --> 01:23:02,870
Give this to Niccolo.

2455
01:23:02,871 --> 01:23:04,410
- Give this to him.
- I should.

2456
01:23:04,411 --> 01:23:06,710
With the score of 5 to 0,

2457
01:23:06,711 --> 01:23:08,111
Team Kim Jong Min wins.

2458
01:23:08,611 --> 01:23:09,910
With the score of 5 to 0!

2459
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:11,881
- It's a shutout.
- It's a shutout.

2460
01:23:12,011 --> 01:23:14,520
Team Kim Jong Min, please decide...

2461
01:23:14,521 --> 01:23:18,051
if you will change the balance with Team No Pain No DinDin.

2462
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:20,190
(Current balance: Team Kim Jong Min, 39.5 dollars)

2463
01:23:20,191 --> 01:23:23,090
They would have done well to count.

2464
01:23:23,091 --> 01:23:25,191
- Let's not look at them.
- Do you have your bags?

2465
01:23:25,631 --> 01:23:27,801
(Current balance: Team No Pain No DinDin, 12 dollars)

2466
01:23:28,431 --> 01:23:30,700
(Team Kim Jong Min will suffer a huge loss if they decide to switch.)

2467
01:23:30,701 --> 01:23:31,900
It won't make sense.

2468
01:23:31,901 --> 01:23:34,740
It would be amazing if they didn't eat.

2469
01:23:34,741 --> 01:23:37,411
There's no way they wouldn't have eaten with Se Yoon.

2470
01:23:37,511 --> 01:23:39,110
Do you want us to switch or not?

2471
01:23:39,111 --> 01:23:40,631
It would be great if it gets switched.

2472
01:23:40,741 --> 01:23:42,781
- They didn't eat.
- Really?

2473
01:23:43,111 --> 01:23:45,180
This is what Se Yoon says.

2474
01:23:45,181 --> 01:23:46,920
- Make changes in variety shows.
- Right.

2475
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:49,451
When we flipped the coin earlier,

2476
01:23:49,521 --> 01:23:50,950
we made one last flip...

2477
01:23:50,951 --> 01:23:52,151
- to win the money.
- Right.

2478
01:23:52,291 --> 01:23:53,321
That was how we won it.

2479
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:55,861
- Let's make the switch!
- Right. We'll switch.

2480
01:23:55,891 --> 01:23:57,090
- Let's make the switch!
- Right. We'll switch.

2481
01:23:57,091 --> 01:23:58,290
(Smiling)

2482
01:23:58,291 --> 01:24:00,001
I've been with Joon...

2483
01:24:00,461 --> 01:24:03,030
in "Workman."

2484
01:24:03,031 --> 01:24:04,671
He knows you too well.

2485
01:24:05,131 --> 01:24:07,101
- This sounds like a trap.
- This is a trap.

2486
01:24:07,471 --> 01:24:09,471
- This is stressing me out so much.
- It's a trap.

2487
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:12,070
Gosh, he said something he didn't need to say just now.

2488
01:24:12,071 --> 01:24:14,510
- We can't switch!
- No. Hold on.

2489
01:24:14,511 --> 01:24:17,150
Make the right choice, Joon. We don't have money.

2490
01:24:17,151 --> 01:24:18,680
I'm walking on eggshells even after winning.

2491
01:24:18,681 --> 01:24:20,080
- This is crazy.
- This is crazy.

2492
01:24:20,081 --> 01:24:21,997
Let's move on if you aren't going to make the switch.

2493
01:24:22,021 --> 01:24:23,490
(What will these two decide to do?)

2494
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:24,951
I don't know what to do.

2495
01:24:25,121 --> 01:24:26,121
Let's make the switch!

2496
01:24:27,391 --> 01:24:29,460
I'm dying to know how much they have.

2497
01:24:29,461 --> 01:24:30,560
Let's make the switch!

2498
01:24:30,561 --> 01:24:32,130
We'll make the switch as we're dying to know how much they have.

2499
01:24:32,131 --> 01:24:33,200
Let's switch.

2500
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:34,901
We agreed to switch.

2501
01:24:35,501 --> 01:24:36,630
Give it to them.

2502
01:24:36,631 --> 01:24:38,131
(Exchanged)

2503
01:24:38,431 --> 01:24:41,000
(They exchanged the money.)

2504
01:24:41,001 --> 01:24:42,941
(All that remains is...)

2505
01:24:43,441 --> 01:24:46,981
(It's time to watch how the winners celebrate it.)

2506
01:24:47,341 --> 01:24:49,410
(What a sudden windfall!)

2507
01:24:49,411 --> 01:24:50,581
This is a lot.

2508
01:24:50,781 --> 01:24:52,227
- My goodness.
- We have a lot of money.

2509
01:24:52,251 --> 01:24:53,420
(Meanwhile, he anxiously rummages through the pouch.)

2510
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,981
- My goodness.
- We have a lot of money.

2511
01:24:56,251 --> 01:24:58,121
(A disaster)

2512
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:02,391
(Denying reality)

2513
01:25:02,491 --> 01:25:03,491
We're doomed.

2514
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:07,861
(From 12 dollars to 39.5 dollars, they hit the jackpot.)

2515
01:25:08,201 --> 01:25:10,000
My investment has failed.

2516
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:11,571
DinDin, keep the money well.

2517
01:25:11,831 --> 01:25:13,951
Do you think we didn't get it because we didn't know?

2518
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:16,671
It's not that we didn't know.

2519
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:19,311
- Gosh, seriously...
- We were crushing it.

2520
01:25:19,511 --> 01:25:21,410
(Reality hit them.)

2521
01:25:21,411 --> 01:25:22,781
What just happened?

2522
01:25:23,111 --> 01:25:24,811
Why are we like this after we won?

2523
01:25:25,651 --> 01:25:27,220
What should we say to Seon Ho?

2524
01:25:27,221 --> 01:25:28,741
- I feel bad for Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho...

2525
01:25:28,951 --> 01:25:30,950
Tell Seon Ho about it at the crucial moment.

2526
01:25:30,951 --> 01:25:31,951
Okay.

2527
01:25:33,291 --> 01:25:34,620
This one looks pretty.

2528
01:25:34,621 --> 01:25:37,761
(Seon Ho, unaware of this, is still busy shucking oysters.)

2529
01:25:37,991 --> 01:25:40,201
My goodness. This is legendary.

2530
01:25:42,501 --> 01:25:43,501
What?

2531
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:45,871
You should eat it.

2532
01:25:46,031 --> 01:25:47,200
- Shall I?
- Just eat it.

2533
01:25:47,201 --> 01:25:49,371
Viewers would want you to eat it.

2534
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:51,170
When else will you get to eat something like that?

2535
01:25:51,171 --> 01:25:52,941
- You can't eat it in Seoul.
- I know.

2536
01:25:53,641 --> 01:25:55,211
Even if it's fresh,

2537
01:25:55,581 --> 01:25:57,221
it won't taste the same as one from here.

2538
01:25:57,911 --> 01:25:59,450
I should try at least one properly.

2539
01:25:59,451 --> 01:26:01,521
- My gosh. I should do this.
- Yes.

2540
01:26:01,881 --> 01:26:04,521
You should slurp the oyster.

2541
01:26:05,221 --> 01:26:07,221
(He adds some chojang and takes a big bite.)

2542
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:11,161
What?

2543
01:26:11,431 --> 01:26:13,061
(He fell for it.)

2544
01:26:15,731 --> 01:26:18,471
The scent of oyster must spread in your mouth.

2545
01:26:19,031 --> 01:26:22,471
(After tasting one oyster, the lamb fails to stop himself.)

2546
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:26,741
(He eats three pieces in a row.)

2547
01:26:28,811 --> 01:26:32,381
(He naturally reaches for more oysters.)

2548
01:26:33,281 --> 01:26:34,821
I think he's eaten about 100g.

2549
01:26:35,951 --> 01:26:36,991
Good job, Seon Ho.

2550
01:26:38,051 --> 01:26:39,320
I can't stop now.

2551
01:26:39,321 --> 01:26:40,520
Let's see how much you ate.

2552
01:26:40,521 --> 01:26:42,661
(Se Yoon goes to check out Seon Ho's oysters, )

2553
01:26:43,261 --> 01:26:45,661
(Seon Ho is getting ready to eat more.)

2554
01:26:45,761 --> 01:26:48,031
(Glancing)

2555
01:26:51,371 --> 01:26:53,241
(Eat more, Seon Ho.)

2556
01:26:54,471 --> 01:26:57,541
You have to eat it. I won't tell anyone.

2557
01:26:57,671 --> 01:26:58,671
Go ahead and eat.

2558
01:27:00,441 --> 01:27:01,611
This is the last one.

2559
01:27:02,681 --> 01:27:03,781
- The last one?
- Yes.

2560
01:27:04,381 --> 01:27:06,010
Then, you should eat about five pieces at once.

2561
01:27:06,011 --> 01:27:07,520
- I'd love that.
- Okay. Go ahead.

2562
01:27:07,521 --> 01:27:08,857
(He accepts the offer right away!)

2563
01:27:08,881 --> 01:27:10,820
Hang on. I might end up eating all the oysters I have.

2564
01:27:10,821 --> 01:27:11,950
(He carefully places 5 oysters on his hand.)

2565
01:27:11,951 --> 01:27:14,060
- Hey, this is...
- They are five pieces.

2566
01:27:14,061 --> 01:27:15,890
- Boast it.
- I think this is about 50g.

2567
01:27:15,891 --> 01:27:17,490
Say something before you eat.

2568
01:27:17,491 --> 01:27:18,530
- Say something?
- Yes.

2569
01:27:18,531 --> 01:27:21,801
If you don't come to Sacheon to eat oysters in winter,

2570
01:27:22,431 --> 01:27:23,431
it's your loss.

2571
01:27:23,901 --> 01:27:25,300
Come and enjoy the oysters.

2572
01:27:25,301 --> 01:27:26,370
Go, Team Jong Min!

2573
01:27:26,371 --> 01:27:28,501
Go, Team Jong Min! Put them into your mouth now!

2574
01:27:30,141 --> 01:27:32,010
Squeeze out the chojang.

2575
01:27:32,011 --> 01:27:33,111
(Squeezing)

2576
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,340
(Happy)

2577
01:27:35,341 --> 01:27:36,481
How nice.

2578
01:27:36,911 --> 01:27:38,611
One more time!

2579
01:27:39,481 --> 01:27:43,351
(An encore performance of the oyster eating show)

2580
01:27:43,521 --> 01:27:45,491
My history began with "Just one bite."

2581
01:27:45,591 --> 01:27:47,290
When I took a huge bite of something,

2582
01:27:47,291 --> 01:27:48,890
I started to become popular.

2583
01:27:48,891 --> 01:27:51,791
You will do the same with oysters.

2584
01:27:52,491 --> 01:27:54,360
- With oysters.
- With oysters?

2585
01:27:54,361 --> 01:27:55,701
- One more time!
- One more time.

2586
01:27:55,961 --> 01:27:58,800
(Seon Ho, one more time!)

2587
01:27:58,801 --> 01:28:00,770
Seon Ho, one more time

2588
01:28:00,771 --> 01:28:04,141
(Your eating show brings me happiness.)

2589
01:28:04,411 --> 01:28:06,480
All right. That's nice.

2590
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:08,487
(As a seafood fanatic, he finished 10 pieces in 2 goes.)

2591
01:28:08,511 --> 01:28:10,080
It's amazing even for a man in his twenties.

2592
01:28:10,081 --> 01:28:11,951
- It's amazing.
- Good. Here we go.

2593
01:28:12,011 --> 01:28:13,850
(Giving up on the money, he puts the oysters into his mouth.)

2594
01:28:13,851 --> 01:28:16,121
Here it comes.

2595
01:28:16,321 --> 01:28:18,051
(Squeezing)

2596
01:28:20,191 --> 01:28:21,761
(Amazed)

2597
01:28:23,261 --> 01:28:25,861
(It's fine as long as you are happy now.)

2598
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:28,901
(Seon Ho, two more times.)

2599
01:28:29,461 --> 01:28:30,800
(He's excited at the thought of avoiding the dive.)

2600
01:28:30,801 --> 01:28:32,931
Seriously, I ate half of it.

2601
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,800
Okay. What are you waiting for? Let's weigh the oysters.

2602
01:28:35,801 --> 01:28:37,801
- Okay. Let's measure the weight.
- Let's do that.

2603
01:28:37,941 --> 01:28:39,511
I ate them all.

2604
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:42,180
(Thanks to Seon Ho's eating show, Team Kim Jong Min is about to lose.)

2605
01:28:42,181 --> 01:28:44,501
If I had known this would happen, I would've ordered more.

2606
01:28:45,181 --> 01:28:47,580
We lost our money when we didn't even eat a lot.

2607
01:28:47,581 --> 01:28:49,551
This is really annoying...

2608
01:28:50,021 --> 01:28:51,720
because we won 5 to 0.

2609
01:28:51,721 --> 01:28:52,850
I know.

2610
01:28:52,851 --> 01:28:54,921
But we exchanged the money.

2611
01:28:55,691 --> 01:28:57,891
I was just curious how much they had.

2612
01:28:58,261 --> 01:28:59,961
- We can do better next time.
- Sure.

2613
01:29:00,431 --> 01:29:02,861
Even though I'm saying this, I'm still sad.

2614
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:11,441
(They worked this hard to earn the money.)

2615
01:29:11,841 --> 01:29:13,311
You should've done more.

2616
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:15,280
(Flustered)

2617
01:29:15,281 --> 01:29:16,950
- I should've done better.
- Why did you not do more?

2618
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:18,750
I should've done better.

2619
01:29:18,751 --> 01:29:21,197
If you were going to give it to us, you should've done better.

2620
01:29:21,221 --> 01:29:22,720
- Too bad.
- Seriously,

2621
01:29:22,721 --> 01:29:24,750
it would've been terrible if I ate only rice and kimchi.

2622
01:29:24,751 --> 01:29:25,751
Right.

2623
01:29:25,752 --> 01:29:27,520
It would've been great if you ate rice and kimchi.

2624
01:29:27,521 --> 01:29:28,561
Darn it.

2625
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:31,360
The dinosaur thing was a big deal.

2626
01:29:31,361 --> 01:29:32,591
I know.

2627
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:35,101
Seon Ho has no idea now.

2628
01:29:35,301 --> 01:29:37,141
Seon Ho is young, so he can go into the water.

2629
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:39,471
- He's young.
- Right.

2630
01:29:40,071 --> 01:29:41,940
I think Seon Ho will happily say things like,

2631
01:29:41,941 --> 01:29:44,140
"Jong Min, I made a lot of money!"

2632
01:29:44,141 --> 01:29:45,810
- I can imagine that.
- Oh, no.

2633
01:29:45,811 --> 01:29:47,511
I feel bad for him.

2634
01:29:47,881 --> 01:29:49,561
(They have no idea he is being like this.)

2635
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:51,411
What if we lose after that?

2636
01:29:51,581 --> 01:29:52,981
"Hey, we have ten dollars."

2637
01:29:55,581 --> 01:29:57,321
(Driving for a while with worries)

2638
01:29:57,551 --> 01:29:59,291
This is too cold.

2639
01:29:59,821 --> 01:30:00,991
It's cold.

2640
01:30:01,091 --> 01:30:03,330
There's no one at the beach.

2641
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:04,560
Who would come here?

2642
01:30:04,561 --> 01:30:05,590
It's really cold here.

2643
01:30:05,591 --> 01:30:07,031
It looks like ice.

2644
01:30:07,131 --> 01:30:09,501
Gosh, this is really...

2645
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:12,370
There's no one at the beach.

2646
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:13,547
(The current temperature is minus 1°C.)

2647
01:30:13,571 --> 01:30:15,411
Jong Min, we're the only ones who are running.

2648
01:30:15,571 --> 01:30:17,210
- Now?
- It's not that we're diving.

2649
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:18,417
(Are they warming up before entering the water?)

2650
01:30:18,441 --> 01:30:20,511
(One, two)

2651
01:30:20,641 --> 01:30:21,981
We are running just in case.

2652
01:30:23,911 --> 01:30:25,750
- What's this?
- What's this?

2653
01:30:25,751 --> 01:30:27,220
Please stand here.

2654
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:29,251
- But...
- What's that thing?

2655
01:30:30,751 --> 01:30:33,190
When it's this cold, aren't we supposed...

2656
01:30:33,191 --> 01:30:34,991
to just look at the sea?

2657
01:30:35,391 --> 01:30:36,631
- You're right.
- It's so cold.

2658
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:38,631
- It's really cold.
- There's no one here.

2659
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:40,030
It's even colder now.

2660
01:30:40,031 --> 01:30:42,131
(Next episode)

2661
01:30:42,401 --> 01:30:44,901
(The night at the end of 2025)

2662
01:30:45,571 --> 01:30:47,701
(The moment the siren goes off, )

2663
01:30:48,371 --> 01:30:51,511
(the escape of 6 members begins.)

2664
01:30:52,141 --> 01:30:55,381
(The time limit is only 15 minutes.)

2665
01:30:56,181 --> 01:30:59,551
(The missions to determine their escape)

2666
01:31:00,551 --> 01:31:03,151
(The more missions they fail, )

2667
01:31:03,851 --> 01:31:06,421
(the longer the night will become.)

2668
01:31:06,721 --> 01:31:09,261
(The 6 escapees are on the run.)

2669
01:31:10,431 --> 01:31:14,301
(Escape this place safely within the time limit.)

2670
01:31:14,831 --> 01:31:17,931
(Time passes by relentlessly.)

2671
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:20,541
(A great escape in the middle of the night)

2672
01:31:21,641 --> 01:31:25,441
(Will they succeed?)

2673
01:31:25,741 --> 01:31:26,810
What?

2674
01:31:26,811 --> 01:31:29,381
(See you next week.)
