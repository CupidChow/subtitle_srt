1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:05,115
(Where refreshing citrons grow close to the sea)

2
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:08,955
(Today's starting point is Goheung.)

3
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:11,155
What is this?

4
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:13,285
Are we going to an island today?

5
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:15,154
Are we going to an island?

6
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:16,594
(Laughing)

7
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:18,594
- It's such a lovely day.
- Are we going to an island?

8
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:19,824
- Hello.
- Hello.

9
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:20,825
- Hello.
- This is nice.

10
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:22,865
Hello. The weather's lovely today.

11
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:25,504
- It's such a nice day.
- What incredible weather.

12
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:26,704
- It's amazing.
- Everyone.

13
00:00:26,705 --> 00:00:27,864
Let's start with some applause.

14
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:29,305
- Yes.
- Let's applaud.

15
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,434
(Why are they suddenly clapping?)

16
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:31,805
- What for?
- What's going on?

17
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:34,274
- Sae Ho's hair got quite long.
- Yes, I grew it out.

18
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:35,374
In case he wins the Grand Award,

19
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,614
- he's keeping it long.
- What are you saying?

20
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:37,674
- Applause.
- No.

21
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:39,314
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations in advance.

22
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:40,644
No. It's not that at all.

23
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:42,414
For the Cho Sae Ho Grand Award Project,

24
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:44,555
- he's keeping his hair long.
- No.

25
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:46,754
I wanted to try a different hairstyle...

26
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,884
He permed it too.

27
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:49,825
- Jong Min, congratulations.
- Yes.

28
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:51,495
What for?

29
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:53,824
For growing older? Is that it?

30
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:55,024
You're the oldest of the day.

31
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:56,434
(Kim Jong Min, today's oldest member)

32
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:57,765
I'm a Young Forty.

33
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:00,905
- You're an Old Forty.
- Old Forty.

34
00:01:01,065 --> 00:01:02,304
You're totally a Young Forty.

35
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:03,434
(Drawing the line)

36
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:04,705
I saw this look online.

37
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:07,445
- Se Yoon's look today...
- What?

38
00:01:07,575 --> 00:01:09,644
A man with a bulging belly. I saw a guy just like him.

39
00:01:09,645 --> 00:01:11,675
Sae Ho's not a Young Forty, though.

40
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:13,584
- Why not?
- What's a Young Forty?

41
00:01:13,585 --> 00:01:14,585
- A copycat?
- Someone...

42
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:15,915
who cluelessly copies the fashion.

43
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:18,854
- Sae Ho has his own unique style.
- He does.

44
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:19,985
He's an exception.

45
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:21,155
(Is impressed)

46
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:22,794
- Sae Ho...
- You get better each week.

47
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:23,824
He's an exception.

48
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:24,825
- Really?
- Good for you.

49
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:26,925
Jong Min's an exception too.

50
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:28,764
- Why?
- Jong Min...

51
00:01:28,765 --> 00:01:30,335
has zero sense of fashion.

52
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:32,765
He doesn't copy anything.

53
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:34,865
I just put on anything that fits me.

54
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:36,805
But you have to think carefully about this.

55
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:38,475
You'll be a Young Forty soon.

56
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:40,004
- Hey, DinDin.
- You know?

57
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:42,014
- No.
- He'll turn 40 soon.

58
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:43,744
Hey, I still have five years to go!

59
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:45,214
And he likes following trends.

60
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:46,684
- He likes following trends.
- Joon is a Young Forty.

61
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:48,215
Right. I'm a Young Forty.

62
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:50,054
But what does that mean? Is that a good thing?

63
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:51,314
- It's a good thing.
- Everyone.

64
00:01:51,315 --> 00:01:53,054
- It was a long journey here, right?
- Goheung!

65
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:54,155
- All right.
- Are we going to an island?

66
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:55,724
Our destination today is located...

67
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:57,494
on the far edge of South Jeolla Province.

68
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:59,395
It's the number one spot known for citron.

69
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:01,025
- Right.
- This place is famous for citron.

70
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:02,564
A culinary heartland...

71
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:03,594
- for the southern provinces.
- A culinary heartland.

72
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:05,365
(A culinary heartland, full of tasty food)

73
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:08,234
(The edge of the southern sea...)

74
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:11,605
(embraces countless islands and the open ocean.)

75
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:13,445
It's Goheung in South Jeolla Province.

76
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:15,575
Goheung!

77
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:16,814
- Goheung!
- Goheung.

78
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:19,384
- I love it here.
- Goheung is famous for citron...

79
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:20,784
- Eels.
- as well as food.

80
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:22,714
- We're in Jeolla Province.
- This province is famous for it.

81
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:24,014
As we're in Goheung...

82
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:26,084
where citron and good food are at their peak,

83
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:28,184
- Yes. I'm hungry.
- we prepared an amazing dinner...

84
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:29,625
that will definitely satisfy your expectations.

85
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:30,994
- Really?
- My gosh.

86
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:34,124
(A fantastic feast...)

87
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,394
(with Korean beef from Citron Valley)

88
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:39,505
(Well, that was the plan.)

89
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:41,504
- Just a while ago, - Yes?

90
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:42,904
- the meal thief, - What?

91
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:44,334
- Hungry Lupin, - Okay.

92
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:47,445
- stole your entire dinner.
- Hungry Lupin?

93
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:53,545
(What on earth is he talking about?)

94
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:55,755
It was you, right?

95
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:56,884
- Was it you?
- Was it you?

96
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,914
- What's going on?
- Was it you? Who was it?

97
00:02:57,915 --> 00:02:59,055
- Who was it?
- Who was it?

98
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:03,254
(1 hour ago)

99
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:04,725
(7:01am)

100
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:08,735
- Hello.
- Hello.

101
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:11,495
How come I don't see any of our members' cars?

102
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:13,605
What's this? Where am I going?

103
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:16,035
I can just go by myself?

104
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:20,305
(Where's Seon Ho going?)

105
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:22,615
What's this?

106
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:26,445
What on earth is going on? You're making me anxious.

107
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:28,245
- What's all this?
- So...

108
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:31,885
(6 cards are placed in front of him.)

109
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,885
There are six cards here.

110
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:36,895
One of the cards...

111
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:39,425
will say Hungry Lupin.

112
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:42,564
You'll randomly draw a card...

113
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:44,235
to assign the role of Hungry Lupin.

114
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:46,605
- Why am I going alone?
- What's this?

115
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:48,305
What? I'm going there alone?

116
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:50,305
Wait. Where am I going?

117
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:51,734
What are we doing?

118
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:53,245
(They came earlier than usual to pick Hungry Lupin.)

119
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:55,914
(2 Days 1 Night)

120
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:58,175
Choose carefully.

121
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:03,185
- Carefully?
- Yes, carefully.

122
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:06,455
Okay.

123
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:08,624
- That's the card you drew.
- Yes.

124
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,125
(They pick a card after much deliberation.)

125
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:13,025
What's this?

126
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:17,865
You've been chosen as Hungry Lupin...

127
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:20,905
who stole the members' dinner.

128
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:22,435
What?

129
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:24,704
(Trailing off)

130
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:25,805
Why...

131
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:28,705
Is this a good card or a bad card?

132
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:31,914
- It's 1 of us.
- So 1 of us...

133
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:33,914
is Hungry Lupin now, right?

134
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:34,984
That's right. Hungry Lupin.

135
00:04:34,985 --> 00:04:36,454
- It's 5 versus 1.
- Yes.

136
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:41,755
(Someone among them stole their dinner.)

137
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:45,355
(Who is Hungry Lupin?)

138
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:49,635
If I try to survive, I'll die. But if I try to die, I'll survive.

139
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:51,895
Let me do my best to fool them.

140
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:58,005
From now on, you must work to arrest...

141
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:00,505
Hungry Lupin who stole your dinner...

142
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:02,515
and get your dinner back.

143
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:05,545
- We have the upper hand here.
- Gosh, we have the upper hand.

144
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:07,645
- We know a lot about each other.
- Yes.

145
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:10,254
The 6 of them must figure out which 1 of them is Hungry Lupin...

146
00:05:10,255 --> 00:05:12,155
while not knowing each other's identity.

147
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:14,724
(Voted as the culprit)

148
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:16,955
If they successfully arrest Hungry Lupin...

149
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:20,094
(Meal acquired)

150
00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:22,695
the five of them except for Hungry Lupin will get to eat.

151
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:25,664
(Voted as the culprit)

152
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:26,764
(Citizen)

153
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:29,005
If they fail to arrest Hungry Lupin...

154
00:05:30,735 --> 00:05:32,004
(Meal acquired)

155
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:33,704
Hungry Lupin will have dinner...

156
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:35,845
all to himself.

157
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:40,085
Who will get to have dinner tonight?

158
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,085
- All right.
- How can we guess who it is?

159
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:46,125
Every time you complete the group mission throughout today,

160
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:49,455
you'll be given a hint about Hungry Lupin.

161
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:51,354
- That's good.
- We'll figure out who it is then.

162
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:52,795
- Then Hungry Lupin...
- Yes.

163
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,394
Will try to make mistakes...

164
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,764
- to prevent us from getting a hint.
- Of course.

165
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:57,065
- Probably.
- My gosh.

166
00:05:57,965 --> 00:05:59,005
It's you.

167
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:00,664
It's you.

168
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:02,305
- What was that? What?
- Seriously.

169
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,174
- That sounded really awkward.
- My gosh.

170
00:06:04,175 --> 00:06:05,804
- I have my own reasoning.
- Really?

171
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:06,805
- Hey.
- It's you.

172
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:08,544
That's how an entertainer with 20 years of experience reacts?

173
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:10,014
- I have 25 years of experience.
- It's 25 years?

174
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:11,074
Yes. I have 25 years of experience.

175
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:13,415
- You're on the suspect list now.
- All right.

176
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:15,014
Are we going to start now?

177
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:16,884
- Yes. Starting now...
- What? DinDin.

178
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:18,354
- What was that, DinDin?
- You're acting weird.

179
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:20,224
- You're acting weird, DinDin.
- No. I was just asking.

180
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:21,384
You're acting weird.

181
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:22,554
Hey, you sounded so awkward.

182
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:25,225
Honestly, things have been weird for me every day.

183
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:27,225
Seriously. I'm having a tough time.

184
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:29,464
- Joon is acting weird too.
- My gosh.

185
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:30,794
It's not me. I swear.

186
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:33,104
Typically, the one who easily suspects people...

187
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:34,565
- turns out to be the culprit.
- Right.

188
00:06:34,705 --> 00:06:35,775
Right.

189
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:37,474
- What?
- What?

190
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:40,975
However, there's a way for everyone including Hungry Lupin...

191
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:44,014
to enjoy dinner together.

192
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:46,115
- Okay. This is the best option.
- I like that.

193
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:49,715
If you complete all of the three missions,

194
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,625
everyone will get to have a filling dinner.

195
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:57,195
Hungry Lupin has two options.

196
00:06:57,995 --> 00:06:59,694
(Mission 1, Mission 2, Mission 3: Success)

197
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:01,724
He can help complete all three group missions,

198
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:03,235
so they can all have dinner together.

199
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:07,164
(Voted as the culprit)

200
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:09,135
Or he could make them fail to catch Hungry Lupin...

201
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,074
and eat dinner by himself.

202
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:12,104
(Make them fail to catch him and eat dinner by himself.)

203
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:13,944
- That's good. We can all eat.
- Yes.

204
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:15,714
But Hungry Lupin will mess up on purpose.

205
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:16,774
- He wouldn't do that.
- Why?

206
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:18,644
The chance of completing all three missions is low.

207
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:19,844
- But still.
- Here's what I think.

208
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:21,244
- For the first mission, - If we try hard...

209
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:22,814
Hungry Lupin will do his best...

210
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:24,354
- just in case.
- Right.

211
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:25,854
But if he thinks it won't go well for him,

212
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:27,324
he'll mess up the second mission.

213
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:29,124
What's important is that we'll get hints.

214
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,124
But let's say we fail the mission.

215
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,125
- Is it you?
- It's not me.

216
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,924
- Jong Min, your acting is good.
- It's not me!

217
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:35,065
(It's not me!)

218
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:37,434
You're rarely this energetic during the opening segment.

219
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:38,534
Why are you so chatty today?

220
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:40,634
- I'm just working hard.
- Why all of a sudden?

221
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:42,474
- Why around this time of the year?
- I'm just working hard.

222
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:44,404
- What's going on with you?
- Why do you work hard...

223
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:45,804
- only in the second half?
- He starts working hard...

224
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:47,304
- starting November.
- This is an important period.

225
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:48,305
- Is there a reason?
- Why...

226
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:49,644
I must work hard in November.

227
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:51,745
He works hard for two months.

228
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:53,184
This is the last chance...

229
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:55,615
to get more points for the awards ceremony.

230
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:57,115
Guys, this is the time.

231
00:07:58,785 --> 00:07:59,955
- Now?
- All right.

232
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:03,225
- Joon, you're not saying anything.
- Right now...

233
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:05,425
- What?
- What was that?

234
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,864
What kind of reaction was that?

235
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:08,165
I've always been like this.

236
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:10,965
- Can we just casually ask him?
- Yes.

237
00:08:11,135 --> 00:08:13,635
- Are you Hungry Lupin, Joon?
- Gosh, you... I'm not.

238
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:14,864
- "You are not?"
- "You are not?"

239
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:16,075
- "You are not?"
- Gosh.

240
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,874
Do you know the worst part about me...

241
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,474
being the culprit in a game like this?

242
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:22,304
- I can't lie for the life of me.
- Right.

243
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:23,314
- I know.
- It would've been obvious already.

244
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:24,645
- It's obvious now.
- It's obvious.

245
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:27,614
- Joon.
- My gosh. Listen.

246
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:29,885
It's not me. Let's just move on. I don't want to be in the spotlight.

247
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,114
Joon!

248
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:32,624
- Joon wants us to move on.
- Gosh, it's really not me.

249
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,084
- He wants us to move on.
- It's not me. Stop suspecting me.

250
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:35,284
He's acting odd.

251
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:37,294
- We might find him quite easily.
- Who is it?

252
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:38,524
No. It's really not me.

253
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,594
- We believe Hungry Lupin is...
- Okay.

254
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:41,965
- Joon.
- Yes.

255
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:44,035
- We'll arrest him now.
- It will end at 8:35am.

256
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:46,505
- I don't want dinner now.
- Let's perform at an event.

257
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:48,634
- Let's end it now.
- Yes.

258
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:51,405
(From this moment on, )

259
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:54,875
(Hungry Lupin...)

260
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:58,715
(will lie during games, )

261
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:01,285
(meals, )

262
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:06,255
(and even interviews.)

263
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:10,555
(He will lie the entire time.)

264
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:15,565
(One of them is lying. Who is Hungry Lupin?)

265
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,135
I'll never get caught.

266
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:19,805
Catch me if you can.

267
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,875
(Stay tuned!)

268
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:26,995
Let's begin your first group mission now.

269
00:09:27,113 --> 00:09:28,777
The mission you will try here is called...

270
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,079
Hit the Drum, Head, and Belly...

271
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,950
While Swaying the Hips.

272
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,049
- It's been trending these days.
- Yes.

273
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,219
- I saw it too.
- Doesn't it go like this?

274
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,649
- It's one of the short-form videos.
- It's this.

275
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,420
In the video, they can't stop swaying their hips.

276
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,759
(Let's break up.)

277
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,359
(Is it because I can't stop swaying my hips?)

278
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,729
(Let me go clubbing since she broke up with me.)

279
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,300
I'm sorry. But we'll look it up ourselves.

280
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,860
We'll look it up.

281
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,429
All right. Set it up, please.

282
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,870
(Bring in the props.)

283
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,899
- Could you move back a bit?
- Gosh, that reminds me of Nanta.

284
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,969
- Yes.
- What's that?

285
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,110
(They bring in drums after drums.)

286
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,539
(What kind of mission awaits them?)

287
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,910
- Stop that.
- All right.

288
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,880
The rule is simple.

289
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,180
You have to sway your hips on the beat.

290
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,050
Then follow the action commands I give out...

291
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,779
such as hit the drum, head, and belly.

292
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,019
- Do them in the correct order.
- Hit the belly?

293
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,089
- Whose belly?
- The belly?

294
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,119
- That's confusing.
- All right.

295
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,560
I'll go over the action commands.

296
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,320
When I say, "hit the drum,"

297
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,690
use the stick to hit the drum.

298
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,830
Hit the drum.

299
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:20,429
When I say, "hit the head," hit your own head...

300
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,799
with the toy hammer.

301
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,969
- Hit the drum. Hit the head.
- Right.

302
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,970
- Okay.
- Hit the drum. Hit the head.

303
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,970
What's next?

304
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:26,700
- When I say, "Hit the belly,"
- The belly.

305
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,010
Se Yoon, raise both of your hands.

306
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,739
- Raise my hands?
- I see.

307
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,379
Those who are next to Se Yoon must hit his belly.

308
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,580
Okay. Like this?

309
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,709
- That's a hard one.
- The rest of you...

310
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,949
- can hit your own belly.
- With the toy hammer.

311
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,079
(The rest of them will hit their own belly.)

312
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,550
Four random action commands will make up one set.

313
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,489
If you successfully execute five sets in a row,

314
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,019
- your mission would be completed.
- What a pity.

315
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,590
I'll give you three chances.

316
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,729
Hold on. If that's the rule,

317
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,289
we should place people who are quick...

318
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,429
at picking up these commands next to Se Yoon.

319
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,430
- By the way, - Of course.

320
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:55,829
- Can we switch places?
- here's what we know from this.

321
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,329
It's that I'm not Hungry Lupin.

322
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,639
- Why?
- It'd be so obvious for me.

323
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,499
I need to raise my hands for the last action command.

324
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,970
- No.
- You could get confused.

325
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,610
Hit the drum. Hit the head. And hit the belly.

326
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,209
Hooray. You could mess it up like this.

327
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,250
Right.

328
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,949
(In other words, it will be easy for Hungry Lupin to mess it up.)

329
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,019
- Do you want to practice?
- Let's practice.

330
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,650
- Hit the drum.
- Bam.

331
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,690
- Hit the head.
- Bam.

332
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,420
- What was that?
- Right. I got confused.

333
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,029
(He messed up even during the practice round?)

334
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,999
- I got confused. It's not me.
- It's not even that confusing.

335
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,260
I'm sorry. Let me try again.

336
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,799
- How can this be confusing?
- "This..."

337
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,870
(Is Sae Ho Hungry Lupin?)

338
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,929
- Okay. Let's try again.
- Hit the drum and the head.

339
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,370
Hit the head. Bam.

340
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,709
- You said it wasn't confusing.
- One more time.

341
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,140
Hit the head. Bam.

342
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,779
So that's how it goes.

343
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,610
All right. You must dance at the same time.

344
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,779
- Go.
- How do I sway my hips?

345
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,620
- Like this? Or like this?
- Like this.

346
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,479
One, two.

347
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,550
- Is that how you'll sway your hips?
- Of course.

348
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,650
He's going to sway his hips like this.

349
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:53,490
- Isn't that too fast?
- That's too fast.

350
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,430
Why is he working so hard in November?

351
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,130
- One, two, three, four.
- Two, three.

352
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,659
Hit the drum, hit the drum, hit the belly, and hit the belly.

353
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,729
- Hit the drum, hit the drum, - Hit the drum, hit the drum,

354
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,799
- hit the belly, and hit the belly.
- hit the belly, and hit the belly.

355
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,370
- That's the rule.
- Like this.

356
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,940
- That's too easy.
- That's so confusing.

357
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,799
- Come on. You said it was easy.
- Right?

358
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,810
Come here, Jong Min. Seon Ho, you go over there.

359
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,169
- He's good at this.
- It got confusing with the hips.

360
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,179
- All right.
- It's so easy.

361
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,180
- Seon Ho is good at this.
- You got it now, right?

362
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:15,779
Let's have one more practice round.

363
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,880
Start with the left side.

364
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,150
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

365
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,479
Hit the drum, hit the head, hit the drum, and hit the head.

366
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,790
Hit the drum, hit the head, hit the drum, and hit the head.

367
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,660
- Why...
- What was that?

368
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,459
One, two, three, four.

369
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,060
Hit the drum, hit the head, hit the drum, and hit the head.

370
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,459
- Okay.
- Hit the drum. Hit the head.

371
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,530
- Like this.
- Okay.

372
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,829
(Suspecting him)

373
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,000
- This is confusing.
- Okay.

374
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,630
- Jong Min is acting weird.
- No, it's really confusing.

375
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,069
- It's confusing with four commands.
- He's acting weird.

376
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,239
- This is so weird.
- Right?

377
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,670
- I'm saying you're acting weird.
- Me?

378
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,780
How interesting.

379
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,809
Because Jong Min is Hungry Lupin,

380
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,350
he'll pretend to struggle from the get-go.

381
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,119
(Is he pretending to struggle?)

382
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,549
Hey, don't get nervous.

383
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,860
The judges might get it wrong too.

384
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,730
But you should feel a bit nervous.

385
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,900
- Let's do one last practice round.
- Okay.

386
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,429
Jong Min, don't be distracted.

387
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,529
- Okay.
- It's not that hard.

388
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,569
I'm sorry.

389
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,600
One, two, three, four.

390
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,970
- Left side.
- Left side.

391
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,170
(Left side)

392
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,470
Left side.

393
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,839
Hit the drum, hit the drum, hit the head, and hit the drum.

394
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,039
(Hit the drum, hit the drum, hit the head, and hit the drum.)

395
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
To one side.

396
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,209
- Left side.
- One side?

397
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,149
Hit the head, hit the drum, hit the drum, and hit the head.

398
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,250
Hit the head, hit the drum, hit the drum, and hit the head.

399
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,990
- Left side.
- Someone got it wrong.

400
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,520
Someone got it wrong.

401
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,150
- Who is it?
- Who got it wrong?

402
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,190
Jong Min got it wrong.

403
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,519
- No, it wasn't me.
- He...

404
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,459
It was hit the head, hit the drum, hit the drum, and hit the head.

405
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,300
- But he hit the drum at the end.
- Wait.

406
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,959
Seon Ho skipped one command.

407
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,100
See?

408
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,830
- Why did you skip it?
- My gosh.

409
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,099
(A new suspect shows up.)

410
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,070
- He kept suspecting us.
- No.

411
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,169
(Hit the head, hit the drum, hit the drum, and hit the head.)

412
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,379
(It was a mess.)

413
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,010
My gosh. I really got confused.

414
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,850
Something feels very awkward about him.

415
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,280
I think even a kindergartener can follow the commands.

416
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,050
I mean, he's young too. How could he get this wrong?

417
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,819
How is this confusing?

418
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,160
(I found you, Hungry Lupin.)

419
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,359
- How is this confusing?
- Are you Hungry Lupin?

420
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,430
No.

421
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,400
All right, everyone. Let's try it.

422
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,399
- Gosh.
- It's so confusing.

423
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,330
- Seriously. Seon Ho.
- This isn't going to work.

424
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,900
You'll be sorry.

425
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,170
Let's begin.

426
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:22,509
- One, two, three, four.
- This one will count, right?

427
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,669
Left side.

428
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,110
(Will they succeed or fail? What will Hungry Lupin decide?)

429
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,509
Hit the head, hit the drum, hit the head, and hit the drum.

430
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,649
Hit the head, hit the drum...

431
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,249
- The command was hit the head.
- What?

432
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,649
Why did you get this wrong?

433
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,790
- What was that, Jong Min?
- Sorry. Let me try again.

434
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,389
- How many times must we redo it?
- I suddenly forgot.

435
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,219
- Are you Hungry Lupin?
- No. Forget about Hungry Lupin.

436
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,820
You must be Hungry Lupin.

437
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,960
- Hey. No.
- How could you get this wrong?

438
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,759
I was thinking about something else completely.

439
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,530
- Why were you distracted?
- Why were you distracted?

440
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,730
Let me say something. We should exclude Jong Min...

441
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,570
from the suspect list.

442
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,239
He's not capable of playing games like this.

443
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,269
- Right.
- Yes.

444
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,509
(Were you really distracted?)

445
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,780
I really didn't get how to play it. It was such a difficult game.

446
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,739
(Dodging the question with a smile)

447
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,310
This is your second try.

448
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,809
- You failed the first try.
- How many tries do we have left?

449
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,919
- How many tries do we have left?
- Three.

450
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,819
- You must succeed in three tries.
- Okay.

451
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,519
I think we can pull this off. Let's focus and finish it.

452
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,919
- Yes. Let's do it.
- Here it goes.

453
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,960
One, two, three, four.

454
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,360
(Left side)

455
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,629
Left side.

456
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,659
- Left side.
- Left side.

457
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,729
Hit the head, hit the drum, hit the head, and hit the drum.

458
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,700
Hit the head, hit the drum, hit the head, and hit the drum.

459
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,729
(They succeed with the 1st set.)

460
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,729
Hit the belly, hit the belly, hit the drum, and hit the head.

461
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,600
Hit the belly, hit the belly, hit the drum, and hit the head.

462
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,740
(They succeed with the 2nd set.)

463
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,869
Hit the drum, hit the belly, hit the drum, and hit the head.

464
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,880
Hit the drum, hit the belly, hit the drum, and hit the head.

465
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,049
(They succeed with the 3rd set.)

466
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,050
Hit the head, hit the drum, hit the belly, and hit the head.

467
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,150
Hit the head, hit the drum, hit the belly, and hit the head.

468
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,519
- Wrong!
- Who was it?

469
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,950
- Who was it?
- Who was it?

470
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,850
- It's him.
- My gosh.

471
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,420
- I confused the drum and the head.
- Did you also get it wrong?

472
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,359
Someone got it wrong. No, it was Seon Ho.

473
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,060
- It was Seon Ho and Jong Min.
- My gosh!

474
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,559
You got it wrong too.

475
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,959
- Hey.
- You...

476
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,729
- You...
- You're Hungry Lupin, right?

477
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,730
I'm bad at this. But you're not.

478
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,000
- What a great sight.
- I think Jong Min is...

479
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,810
- Jong Min is struggling for real.
- Right.

480
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,869
(Hit the head, hit the drum, hit the belly, and hit the head.)

481
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,909
(Hit the head and hit the drum: Correct)

482
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,310
(Hit the belly, and hit the head: Wrong)

483
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,480
(Jong Min was hanging in there, but messed up the last two.)

484
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,579
Jong Min was pretty good in this round.

485
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,649
Right?

486
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,219
Usually, he can't execute more than one command.

487
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,689
But you made it far this time.

488
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,819
- I was super focused. I'm serious.
- Yes.

489
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,889
- I can see that he was focused.
- Right.

490
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,789
- I was so focused.
- Jong Min tried his best.

491
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,159
- He did his best.
- So it's okay.

492
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,490
- But Seon Ho...
- What were you thinking?

493
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,260
- I confused the drum and the head.
- Why?

494
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,629
(Hit the head, hit the drum, hit the belly, and hit the head.)

495
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,329
(Wrong)

496
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,740
(Was he not even trying to get it right?)

497
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,869
- You have to be Hungry Lupin.
- If he's not Hungry Lupin,

498
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,209
- Seon Ho...
- I'll be so disappointed.

499
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,079
I'm worried about what will happen to him in ten years.

500
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,680
(DinDin is serious.)

501
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,050
I'm sure even the viewers...

502
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,980
will be understanding when Seon Ho and Jong Min mess up.

503
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,290
- They've been watching these two.
- That's true.

504
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,950
We don't even need to suspect them.

505
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,820
We must exclude them. They can't be Hungry Lupin.

506
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,960
I think the one who tries to use this situation must be Hungry Lupin.

507
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,300
That person must be Hungry Lupin.

508
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,699
How's it going for you, Joon? Good?

509
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,869
My gosh, I'm working hard.

510
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,130
You got two helpers.

511
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,370
It's written all over his face. I can see it on Joon's face.

512
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,640
"This is too much."

513
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,770
"Why did I draw that card?"

514
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,840
"How can I pretend not to be it?" His face screams Hungry Lupin.

515
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,480
- Is it going as planned?
- Joon.

516
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,049
You're happy because things are going your way.

517
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,150
You're trying to frame me, but I got all of them right.

518
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,849
Hungry Lupin is trying to do his best.

519
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,449
Because Jong Min and Seon Ho keep messing up,

520
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,589
Hungry Lupin must secretly be satisfied.

521
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,790
All right. This is your last try.

522
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,360
This is our last try. It's our third one.

523
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,029
The one who messes up on purpose now...

524
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,000
could be Hungry Lupin in my opinion.

525
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,870
Let's keep an eye on Joon.

526
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,240
- Let's begin.
- Let's do it. Let's go.

527
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,640
One, two, three, four.

528
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,240
Left side.

529
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,710
My gosh. Should I start acting again?

530
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,779
Let me do my best to fool them.

531
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,880
- Left side.
- Left side.

532
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,979
Hit the head, hit the drum, hit the head, and hit the head.

533
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,049
- Hit the head, hit the drum, - Hit the head, hit the drum,

534
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,079
- hit the head, and hit the head.
- hit the head, and hit the head.

535
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,149
(Wrong)

536
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,420
Jong Min is struggling a lot.

537
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,790
(Is it Seon Ho again?)

538
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,630
- It's DinDin.
- What?

539
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,930
Come on!

540
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,130
(An unexpected culprit)

541
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,900
- No. I wasn't the only one.
- Who was it?

542
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,540
- I wasn't the only one.
- Raise your hand.

543
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,239
- Joon messed up too.
- Seon Ho too.

544
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,010
See? Everyone got it wrong. Why are you blaming only me?

545
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,940
- What? Only we got it right?
- Seon Ho.

546
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,180
Did you mess up again?

547
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,980
- Did you mess up again?
- Did you mess up again?

548
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,580
This is just crazy.

549
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,880
(And these two...)

550
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,489
You were doing well.

551
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,590
Why did you two mess up on the last try?

552
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,660
- On the last try.
- All of a sudden.

553
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,119
- We all know Jong Min is a fool.
- Jong Min messed up too?

554
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,790
- But why did you two mess up too?
- Hey.

555
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,759
I'm just stupid. But why did you two mess up?

556
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,129
- Why did you mess up?
- All of a sudden.

557
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,459
- We all know Jong Min is a fool.
- Why did you mess up?

558
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,129
- But why did you two mess up too?
- Why did you mess up?

559
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,229
This is our last try. It's our third one.

560
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,939
(DinDin expected Hungry Lupin...)

561
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,840
(to mess up on purpose in the last round.)

562
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,769
- Why did you mess up?
- It got harder.

563
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,779
It was hard.

564
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,879
- It suddenly got harder.
- Why was that hard?

565
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,179
- Your ears are getting red.
- What?

566
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,049
- It was a hard one.
- It was a hard one.

567
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,950
- No. Joon must be it.
- I messed up because it was hard.

568
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,479
You messed up every single time.

569
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,619
- You don't deserve to suspect us.
- You stay out of this. Seriously.

570
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,319
How can we catch Hungry Lupin when we are all bad at this game?

571
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,849
It was hard. I'm serious.

572
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,189
This is the set of commands you messed up.

573
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,159
Hit the head, hit the drum, hit the head, and hit the head.

574
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,489
- Try it. Why is that hard?
- Hit the head...

575
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,529
What was it? Say it again?

576
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,199
- His pronunciation...
- I thought he said, "belly."

577
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,029
- Come on.
- Right? His pronunciation...

578
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,129
"Hit the head, hit the drum,"

579
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,199
"hit the dad, and hit the bed."

580
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,270
- That's what he said.
- No way.

581
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,639
- On the last try? All of a sudden?
- It did sound off.

582
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,139
- I couldn't hear him well.
- It did sound off. I'm serious.

583
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,499
You couldn't hear him at the end when you heard him well before?

584
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,739
I lowered my guard, I guess.

585
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,640
- You were great. Why mess up now?
- Exactly.

586
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,409
- You two were doing well.
- Why did you mess up?

587
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,210
They were great and didn't get any command wrong.

588
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,650
Why did DinDin mess up in the last round?

589
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,850
So one of us is acting right now. That's for sure.

590
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,950
But in my opinion,

591
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,460
Hungry Lupin didn't mess up at all during this game.

592
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,919
- He actually did well?
- Not even once.

593
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,989
- He was focused.
- Did you get anything wrong?

594
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,329
I didn't get anything wrong.

595
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,200
- But I'm not Hungry Lupin.
- What?

596
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,629
- I'm serious.
- What?

597
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,259
- So...
- He just excluded himself.

598
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm serious. I did my best.

599
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,400
- How come you didn't mess up?
- Basically...

600
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,540
- How come you didn't mess up?
- He's suspected for not messing up.

601
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,509
(Suspecting the one who didn't mess up)

602
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,710
This is weird.

603
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,380
Hungry Lupin...

604
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,440
needs to win people over.

605
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,180
Personally, I think Se Yoon played the game too well.

606
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Left side.

607
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,549
- Because he didn't mess up...
- Will you give me time to explain?

608
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,949
Okay. I'll give you time.

609
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,119
- Can I get 30 seconds?
- Okay.

610
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,419
- Yes?
- All right, Se Yoon.

611
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,459
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

612
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,359
I entered the Recreation and Leisure Department in 2001.

613
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,759
- I was the student representative.
- Yes.

614
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,730
I've been training to follow separate commands orally...

615
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,069
and physically since I was 20. I became used to that.

616
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,299
I just wanted to beat this game as soon as possible.

617
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,269
But I didn't know we had this many dummies.

618
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,539
So who do you think is Hungry Lupin?

619
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,509
- Two suspects are on my radar.
- Who are they?

620
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,410
I believe that Joon is Hungry Lupin.

621
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,540
I can bet my right wrist.

622
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,809
- If I were to take a risk, - He's sure of himself.

623
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,049
I could bring down Joon.

624
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,749
If something unexpected happens,

625
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,819
there's another candidate that comes to mind.

626
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
- Who is it?
- It's you.

627
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:44,849
Me?

628
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,919
(It's you.)

629
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,220
Sae Ho has...

630
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,360
absolutely no reason to suspect me,

631
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,500
but why is he going after me when I'm just an innocent citizen?

632
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,330
It's his strategy to attack me...

633
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,929
before anyone starts suspecting him.

634
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,470
However, he's making a huge mistake.

635
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,170
(The two of them started to suspect each other.)

636
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,309
You failed your first team mission.

637
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,939
(Failed the first Hungry Lupin mission)

638
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,739
You won't get any hint about Hungry Lupin.

639
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,610
Did we also lose our chance to have dinner together?

640
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,979
- That's correct.
- Right.

641
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,850
Unfortunately, dinner for the entire group has been lost.

642
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,420
- We must catch him no matter what.
- Gosh.

643
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,120
Anyway, Hungry Lupin will step up even more now.

644
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,019
From now on,

645
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,830
do your best...

646
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,489
to figure out who Hungry Lupin is throughout the trip.

647
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,499
Let's go.

648
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,529
Okay.

649
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,560
All right.

650
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,529
- Se Yoon seems suspicious.
- Right.

651
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,400
(They failed to earn the hint due to Hungry Lupin's interference.)

652
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,840
Am I behaving awkwardly?

653
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,110
We will definitely catch him.

654
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,210
This is how I usually am.

655
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,980
Thank you. Interview me again later.

656
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,449
I will catch you soon.

657
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,710
(Who is Hungry Lupin?)

658
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,550
(Hungry Lupin is hidden among the six of them.)

659
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,090
(With everyone eyeing each other suspiciously, )

660
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,990
(the vibe in the bus is completely different from usual.)

661
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,730
Will it be a long ride?

662
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,130
It will take...

663
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,559
about 25 minutes.

664
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,730
Se Yoon must have asked that question...

665
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,199
to do his best during the game.

666
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,439
He could be Hungry Lupin.

667
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,199
I'm just saying without thinking.

668
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,810
I'm actually hungry.

669
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,669
- You're actually hungry?
- When are you giving us food?

670
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,710
- I'm also very hungry.
- I'm starving.

671
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,080
When we start early, give us food early as well.

672
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,179
All of us are hungry.

673
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,979
Can't we discuss freely among ourselves?

674
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,690
- Of course.
- About who it is.

675
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,090
Earlier, I suspected Se Yoon a lot.

676
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,620
However, I couldn't help suspect Cheol as well.

677
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,800
It seems like Cheol is very much at ease today.

678
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,059
- I see.
- More...

679
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,030
- He got all wrong at the end.
- That's why...

680
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,370
That's what I'm wondering about.

681
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:45,610
(DinDin is much calmer than usual today.)

682
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,740
(He also got it wrong towards the end of the mission.)

683
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,949
(Is DinDin today's Hungry Lupin?)

684
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,150
Usually,

685
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,349
Sae Ho is... How shall I put it?

686
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,289
How can I say it in a nice way?

687
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,449
- What?
- Being obnoxious.

688
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,719
- Being obnoxious?
- Just say that I'm obnoxious.

689
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,489
How can we say obnoxious in a nice way?

690
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,789
- He's obnoxious.
- He takes the lead.

691
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,160
He often takes the lead.

692
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,229
Taking the lead is being obnoxious in a good way?

693
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,059
Usually, he's nice and takes the lead.

694
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,129
You try to say things in a positive way.

695
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,529
- You've changed a lot.
- By the way...

696
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,099
He did something which I thought was over the top.

697
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,440
- Okay.
- While looking for Hungry Lupin,

698
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,210
he stepped back and looked at us from behind.

699
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,879
- Was that necessary?
- He kept doing that.

700
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,409
He pointed at Se Yoon.

701
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,010
- From behind us.
- He behaved in a particular way?

702
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,880
(He kept stepping back during the mission.)

703
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,820
(Sae Ho pointed at Se Yoon for being Hungry Lupin.)

704
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,060
I think it's either Sae Ho or Joon.

705
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,429
Seon Ho, you're guessing the wrong person.

706
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,190
Cheol keeps suspecting me.

707
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,000
It makes him very suspicious.

708
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,829
Since I'm following the order of the queue...

709
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,999
- I thought about that too.
- You know what I mean?

710
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,129
- That's exactly what I thought.
- Right.

711
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,039
- Time-out, Sae Ho.
- That's what I also thought.

712
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,269
When someone suspects Mafia,

713
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,399
Mafia suspects him in return.

714
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,939
- He suspected me all of a sudden.
- No way.

715
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,279
- His reaction was immediate.
- May I bring this up?

716
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,309
Can we share what we said during the interview?

717
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,810
Whom we suspected?

718
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,850
I said casually that I suspected Se Yoon and DinDin.

719
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,149
That's why I'm talking eagerly...

720
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,620
about Se Yoon and DinDin.

721
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,620
- I don't think it's Sae Ho.
- Right.

722
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,120
- Here's why.
- That's possible.

723
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,890
He just asked...

724
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,030
if he could share whom he suspected during the interview.

725
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,429
They probably asked Hungry Lupin...

726
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,670
- if things were going well.
- Right.

727
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,170
He probably wasn't asked whom he suspected.

728
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,499
- However, - Right.

729
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,009
Based on what Sae Ho said,

730
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,939
- he knew what the question was.
- Goodness.

731
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,969
- Nice.
- That's why he asked...

732
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,740
if he could share what he said during the interview.

733
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,310
- Sae Ho must be exempted.
- Exactly.

734
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,179
On the other hand, Se Yoon hasn't said a word.

735
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,250
- Joon is being strange.
- I said it in the beginning.

736
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,320
Se Yoon, why did you smile?

737
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,820
- How you play is interesting.
- What?

738
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,490
- Se Yoon.
- Yes?

739
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,689
- You can relax.
- It's not me.

740
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,160
You can make me feel uncomfortable.

741
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,299
Anyway, it's very obvious.

742
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,830
Do you also see several cards in front of you?

743
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,599
- I was the first one.
- When I asked...

744
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,039
There were six cards in front of me.

745
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,000
They told me that we were called in the order of age.

746
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,040
- From youngest to oldest.
- At first, there were six cards.

747
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,010
Each person picked a card.

748
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,109
I think I was the fourth to arrive.

749
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,580
- Right.
- I had three cards in front of me.

750
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,050
Let's share what each of us got.

751
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,750
We can talk about it, right?

752
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,220
- Share which card we had...
- Then it will be over.

753
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,619
(A huge chance for the citizens)

754
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,719
(A huge crisis for Hungry Lupin)

755
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,819
- Wait.
- Then it's game over.

756
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,959
Se Yoon.

757
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,290
What was on the back of your card?

758
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,760
There was nothing on it.

759
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,029
There was nothing on mine.

760
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,760
- What about you, Jong Min?
- It was blank.

761
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,299
Mine was blank.

762
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,929
- You know what?
- What?

763
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,840
Se Yoon said that there was nothing on his card.

764
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,640
There's no doubt that Sae Ho repeated what Se Yoon said.

765
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,539
Say what was on your card instead of talking about others.

766
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,709
- What was on your card?
- There was nothing.

767
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,840
Then was it black or white?

768
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,610
White.

769
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,049
- Was it white?
- White.

770
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,210
- Are you sure?
- Sae Ho, which color was yours?

771
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,450
White.

772
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,619
- Was yours also white?
- Yes.

773
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,189
See? This won't work.

774
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,789
- Se Yoon isn't Hungry Lupin.
- He should've said something else.

775
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,019
I don't think it's Se Yoon.

776
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,259
- He should've said something else.
- So it's not Se Yoon.

777
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,589
- We should've asked Sae Ho first.
- Exactly.

778
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,929
- Are you suspecting me now?
- He is.

779
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,529
- Wait a minute.
- Goodness.

780
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,400
In my opinion, it's neither Sae Ho nor Cheol.

781
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,270
- Okay.
- What's your reason?

782
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,200
Everything they say is correct.

783
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,439
You may take time to narrow down the list.

784
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,770
- Okay.
- We're going to the next location.

785
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,680
Gosh, there's a lot of citron on the trees.

786
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,749
So that's citron.

787
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,510
- It's just...
- Bunches of citron are hanging.

788
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,420
Let's make an acrostic poem with "citron."

789
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,950
- "Ci."
- It's citron.

790
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,520
- "Tron."
- You brat.

791
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,460
- "Ci."
- You're not alone

792
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,689
- "Rin."
- Don't change it out of the blue.

793
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,090
Suddenly, I wanted to change it to "yuringi."

794
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,399
Goodness.

795
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
(Laughing)

796
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,170
(They arrive at a village after being suspicious for 30 minutes.)

797
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,840
Gosh, the smell is amazing.

798
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,640
The citron smell is incredible.

799
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,279
Goodness.

800
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,410
This is where the history of citron started in Goheung.

801
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,279
- It's Daecheong Village.
- Daecheong?

802
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,820
- Daecheong Village? I see.
- Yes.

803
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,579
I didn't expect it to be filled with the citron smell.

804
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,189
Right? You can smell the citron everywhere in the village.

805
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,519
In Goheung,

806
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,789
the largest amount of citron is produced in the country.

807
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,629
The whole neighborhood is filled with the fragrance of citron.

808
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,130
This is amazing.

809
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,699
- Incredible.
- It feels like there's a diffuser.

810
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,200
- I know. It's amazing.
- Right, a citron diffuser.

811
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,870
Look at the mural.

812
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,470
"Exemption from the military service?"

813
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,699
"If someone cultivated eight or more citron trees,"

814
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,710
"they could be exempted from military duty."

815
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,139
It shows how important citron trees were.

816
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,340
(During the Joseon Dynasty, citron was a rare fruit.)

817
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,249
It smells so good.

818
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,980
(Looking at the citron while forgetting about Hungry Lupin)

819
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,679
- It smells incredible.
- It smells so good.

820
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
(Sniffing)

821
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,050
The citron smell is nice.

822
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,790
This is amazing.

823
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,359
- Do we sit?
- I never tasted something so good.

824
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,059
Yes, please sit down.

825
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,789
Citron has three times more vitamin C...

826
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,199
than lemons.

827
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,400
- Three times more?
- Yes.

828
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,899
Here's the next mission that will take place...

829
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,329
at a beautiful and golden citron field.

830
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,399
- It's called Eating Citron Relay.
- Okay.

831
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,609
You'll be given five minutes.

832
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,469
- Five minutes? That's enough.
- Yes.

833
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,309
You must eat all ten citron to succeed.

834
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,509
Ten is too much.

835
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,680
Each of you must eat at least one citron.

836
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,650
Feel free to distribute the remaining citron as you wish.

837
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,590
Once you swallow it completely...

838
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,259
and whistle, the next player can start.

839
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,929
In this game,

840
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,490
- there are two key points.
- What?

841
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,100
Don't try to watch everyone.

842
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,929
We should only observe Se Yoon and Jong Min.

843
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,169
- Se Yoon is good at eating citron.
- Right.

844
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,370
If Se Yoon struggles to eat it,

845
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,769
it will be worth suspecting him.

846
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,939
Jong Min loves things that are sour.

847
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,640
If he gets disgusted and spits it out,

848
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,979
- we'll have to suspect him.
- Right.

849
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,749
I like sour food,

850
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,049
- but I can't eat it fast.
- Jong Min can eat a lot,

851
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,719
- and Se Yoon can eat fast.
- Right.

852
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,720
I think Se Yoon will be the best at eating it.

853
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,549
Right, he should play last.

854
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,389
- We will put Se Yoon at the end.
- At the end?

855
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,489
- Then you should go first.
- I'll go second.

856
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,759
Shall I go first?

857
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,529
I'll eat one and a half of citron to make it simple.

858
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,829
- You should eat 2.
- You have to eat 2.

859
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,900
- Two?
- Yes.

860
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,830
- You should eat 2.
- There are 10.

861
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,430
Jong Min should eat two.

862
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,899
- Se Yoon should eat 4.
- Se Yoon should eat 2.

863
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,999
Then I will go...

864
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,539
- I'll go 2nd.
- You will play 2nd.

865
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,839
Seon Ho, you'll go third.

866
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,069
- You will play 2nd.
- Seon Ho, you'll go 3rd.

867
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,079
(Thinking)

868
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,209
Joon, you'll go fourth.

869
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,579
He was talking much more than usual.

870
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,050
He decided the general flow of the game.

871
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,220
It's because he's Hungry Lupin.

872
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,950
- Joon will go fourth.
- How many will you eat, Joon?

873
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,419
- I will eat the maximum...
- Are you aware...

874
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,889
that you're suspected the most?

875
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,959
How many will you eat?

876
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,389
- I'll eat as many as possible.
- How many will you eat?

877
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,589
- As many as possible.
- Can you eat three?

878
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,089
- I'll eat three.
- Okay.

879
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,429
Could you switch seats with him?

880
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,829
- He'll eat three.
- Okay.

881
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,070
- Two of you, change your seat.
- Okay.

882
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,929
- I will...
- I'm bad at eating it.

883
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,669
Joon, it's the perfect chance for you to clear your name.

884
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,270
I don't think people suspect me much.

885
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,739
It's easy to tell how dedicated you are...

886
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,939
- in the game.
- Of course.

887
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,209
You can tell how hard they work.

888
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,379
It's obvious.

889
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,910
To be honest, I can devour all the citron.

890
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,820
There's a minute difference of 1mm.

891
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,649
(Key point to watch: Minute 1mm)

892
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,789
Let's start.

893
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,820
You have five minutes. Are you ready?

894
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,190
Get ready.

895
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,289
Set,

896
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,290
- It will be sour.
- go.

897
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:44,630
I don't think it'll be that sour.

898
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,130
It's easy for him.

899
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,329
- The seeds...
- Is it sour?

900
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,569
- He's good at eating it.
- He's good.

901
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,699
- It's not sour.
- It doesn't seem sour.

902
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,029
- That's...
- Don't chew thoroughly.

903
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,300
Can you eat the next one?

904
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,199
- You're good at eating it.
- It doesn't look sour.

905
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,840
I think he lost his tooth.

906
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,739
I heard a loud crack.

907
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,039
It has seeds.

908
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,379
- What if...
- I guess it's not sour.

909
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,280
What if I spit out my tooth instead of seeds?

910
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,850
- That would be fun.
- It would be fun.

911
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,219
Then you'll win the Grand Award.

912
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,550
- It'd be an accident.
- It will be nice.

913
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,249
Can I eat this? I'll whistle when I'm done.

914
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,250
Yes.

915
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:13,759
I guess it's not sour.

916
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,089
He's eating it well.

917
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,689
- He's doing well.
- Yes.

918
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,889
He's working very hard.

919
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,629
He's eating it easily. It must not be sour.

920
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,229
Are you good at eating sour food?

921
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,359
- He's doing well.
- One minute.

922
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,469
He's working hard.

923
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,699
It's been one minute. Hurry up. What are you doing?

924
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,430
- What's wrong with you, Sae Ho?
- Hurry up.

925
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,070
- There he goes again.
- What's wrong, Sae Ho?

926
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,399
It has so many seeds.

927
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,469
- Hey.
- Look at the time.

928
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,470
You should eat the seeds.

929
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:33,069
Gosh, what is he doing?

930
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,880
- It must be Sae Ho.
- He took longer than a minute.

931
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,009
It's definitely Sae Ho.

932
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,079
Is it possible to take longer than a minute?

933
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,079
- Jong Min.
- He's taking long to whistle.

934
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,119
Go.

935
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,979
- I worked very hard.
- Sae Ho passed.

936
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,350
He's chewing with his front teeth.

937
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,519
Hurry up. You're eating one anyway.

938
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,649
(DinDin also spits out the seeds first.)

939
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,590
- He's suspicious too.
- Goodness.

940
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,690
- Isn't it his tooth?
- It has so many seeds.

941
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,959
- Hey.
- It must be sour.

942
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,960
What are you doing?

943
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
(Separating the seeds seems harder than eating it.)

944
00:30:54,961 --> 00:30:56,799
- He's spitting out his front teeth.
- Hurry up. That's good.

945
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,870
Two minutes.

946
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,529
- It takes longer than I thought.
- Two minutes?

947
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,969
We only have five minutes. We must hurry.

948
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,100
Hey, what are you doing?

949
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,839
Next.

950
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,169
(3 minutes remain. What's important starts now.)

951
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,679
- We only have 5 minutes.
- I'll eat a big 1.

952
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,810
Hurry up.

953
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,610
- Don't tell us which you're eating.
- We must hear your whistle.

954
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,050
- Goodness.
- What are you doing?

955
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,379
(It was greed.)

956
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,649
Hey, you punk.

957
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,650
So it's you.

958
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:19,549
- Why you...
- Eat it fast.

959
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,589
Wait.

960
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,360
I told you that it was definitely him.

961
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,530
- We must reach the last player.
- You brat.

962
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,129
- Goodness.
- What is he doing?

963
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,130
We caught him.

964
00:31:28,131 --> 00:31:30,169
- We must reach the last player.
- We got him. The game is over.

965
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,670
- We got Hungry Lupin.
- We caught him.

966
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,199
I've been telling you that he was suspicious.

967
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,699
We can't wait to eat it. Hurry up!

968
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,740
You Hungry Lupin.

969
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,139
- We need to get to Jong Min. Hurry!
- He's definitely Hungry Lupin.

970
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,679
- What did I tell you?
- Look at him act.

971
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,910
He's being suspicious.

972
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,449
I know how to judge people.

973
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,009
He spat out two seeds.

974
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,050
- What is he doing?
- He's chewing so thoroughly.

975
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,220
- What is he doing?
- It's not what you think.

976
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,189
- What's this?
- Gosh.

977
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,559
You can't do this, Joon.

978
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
(The members are narrowing down their investigation.)

979
00:31:54,561 --> 00:31:56,020
Didn't I tell you that he was being strange?

980
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,059
(Everyone is watching Joon.)

981
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,590
Hurry up and eat.

982
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,859
That's why...

983
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,969
Stop talking.

984
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,770
This isn't some fine dining.

985
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,740
Why are you taking so long to eat? You're being annoying.

986
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,310
There's no time to laugh. You have to chew.

987
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,410
Don't make me laugh.

988
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:15,910
What is he doing?

989
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,810
Hurry up.

990
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,810
(Is he acting or is he really having a hard time?)

991
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,379
- This is...
- Hungry Lupin is...

992
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,779
I don't think it's him.

993
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,190
- It's very sour.
- Four minutes?

994
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,919
- Hurry up even if you can't.
- Four?

995
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,290
He's making it way too obvious.

996
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,229
- What?
- What is he doing?

997
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,430
(It's almost certain that they failed the mission.)

998
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,000
- Do it fast.
- Ten seconds.

999
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,300
- He's done.
- Eat it in small pieces.

1000
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,700
It's so sour.

1001
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,869
(It's finally Seon Ho's turn.)

1002
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,170
Can you give us one more minute?

1003
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,900
- Is it sour?
- This is impossible.

1004
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
It's not sour at all.

1005
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,509
Is something wrong with me?

1006
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,280
- Five, four, - How is it not sour?

1007
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:51,150
Three, two, one.

1008
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,109
- Time is up.
- It's not sour at all.

1009
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,149
- You failed to clear the mission.
- I'm sorry, but it's really sour.

1010
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,389
Here's what I thought when I tasted it.

1011
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,789
It's not so sour that it's impossible to eat.

1012
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,189
- Also, - He's lying.

1013
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,220
He chewed a lot.

1014
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,390
It's delicious.

1015
00:33:03,391 --> 00:33:04,830
- That was intense.
- It tastes good.

1016
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,630
Why did you do that?

1017
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,859
I'm being honest.

1018
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,170
I'd like the viewers to try it and see.

1019
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,569
- It's the members who are strange.
- You're being ridiculous.

1020
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,010
- It was as sour as lemon.
- What?

1021
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,409
Mine was as sour as lemon.

1022
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,240
- I'm serious.
- I didn't think you'd go this far.

1023
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,080
What was the last thing he said before eating?

1024
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,879
He said that he was eating the biggest one...

1025
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,150
- before eating it.
- Right.

1026
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,050
(Joon declared that he was eating the biggest one.)

1027
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,820
He took a big one. What does it mean?

1028
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,689
It was to justify that he had a hard time chewing.

1029
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,919
So we don't suspect him.

1030
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,489
I'm not that smart.

1031
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,989
- I know, - I was only trying...

1032
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,959
- but this was probably your plan.
- to sacrifice myself.

1033
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,659
Based on how he played it,

1034
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,529
all the pieces came together.

1035
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,870
- Here's what I think.
- It wasn't a coincidence.

1036
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,940
It's Joon.

1037
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,600
I'm 100 percent sure.

1038
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,709
When the fruit is big,

1039
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,210
- it's usually less sour and sweet.
- That's right.

1040
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,379
It's very strange.

1041
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,010
Honestly, it wasn't that sour.

1042
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,549
(While everyone is pointing out Joon, )

1043
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,550
(what does Sae Ho think?)

1044
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:02,750
The look on Joon's face was strange since this morning.

1045
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,219
- What if...
- But what I ate...

1046
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,260
Joon isn't Hungry Lupin?

1047
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,589
- Hungry Lupin will be ecstatic now.
- I know.

1048
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,959
We're suspecting someone...

1049
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,490
other than him.

1050
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,999
I know what Joon is like.

1051
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,129
I think he really had a hard time eating it.

1052
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,929
I really had a hard time. It was very sour.

1053
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,000
- He's being honest.
- No, he's lying.

1054
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,770
I thought that it was Joon's true side.

1055
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,940
He just acted naturally.

1056
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,579
He should've closed his nostrils...

1057
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,650
or held his breath to eat it somehow.

1058
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:36,180
DinDin is very clever, isn't he?

1059
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,890
Cheol could have sat here...

1060
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,159
expecting that it was impossible to get to the end.

1061
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,089
- He could've thought that.
- By calculating it?

1062
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,689
- That'd be amazing.
- If that's what he thought,

1063
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,259
- he'd be very smart.
- He'd be very clever.

1064
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,229
He placed himself in second.

1065
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,499
After playing his part,

1066
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,469
he could eliminate the possibility of getting suspected.

1067
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,470
By the way, who made Joon sit here?

1068
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,970
He did. It was you.

1069
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,539
- I didn't know...
- Hey.

1070
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,270
That Joon would be this terrible.

1071
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,479
He also put Se Yoon at the very end.

1072
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,310
- That's also strange.
- He decided the entire order.

1073
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,910
It was DinDin.

1074
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,619
- Wait a minute.
- I don't eat fruit like this.

1075
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,249
- Detective Kim Jong Min.
- Yes?

1076
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,249
What do you think?

1077
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,260
This is...

1078
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,660
It's hard to say that it's Joon because he was terrible.

1079
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,959
- It was way too obvious.
- I know.

1080
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,259
In that case,

1081
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,029
is it worth suspecting him?

1082
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,199
Exactly.

1083
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,229
(Shaking his head)

1084
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,400
I have no idea.

1085
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,869
- Did I call you a detective?
- Yes.

1086
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,799
- I take it back.
- Okay.

1087
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,239
Then how about this?

1088
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,569
With some hint at stake,

1089
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,180
Se Yoon will eat 5 citrons in 1 minute.

1090
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,909
Don't do that.

1091
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,210
The seeds will come out like bullets.

1092
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,219
Se Yoon can chew while spitting like a machine gun.

1093
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,819
- Jong Min...
- Because they couldn't play?

1094
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,849
And Se Yoon didn't get to play.

1095
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:49,089
Two for Jong Min, and three for Se Yoon.

1096
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,229
If you eat 5 in 1 minute, we'll accept it.

1097
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,389
- Jong Min.
- Is that possible?

1098
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,230
I can eat a lot, but I can't eat fast.

1099
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,929
- Then let's do this.
- Jong Min.

1100
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,500
- Eating 4 in 1 minute.
- You can do it.

1101
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,930
No, five.

1102
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,139
I'm still suspicious of DinDin.

1103
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,609
Eating 4 in 1 minute is a better condition for us,

1104
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,639
- but he insists on 5.
- Eating 5 is definitely possible.

1105
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,440
- Really?
- Eating four is too easy.

1106
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,179
Eating four citrons is too easy.

1107
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,879
He's not the type to make things...

1108
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,280
harder for everyone.

1109
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,120
Why is he being so enthusiastic about the game?

1110
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,390
So I'm suspicious of DinDin.

1111
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,890
- He's being strange.
- Eating four is too easy.

1112
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
Eating four citrons is too easy.

1113
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:24,259
(Joon is also getting more suspicious of DinDin.)

1114
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,629
- Jong Min, you know why you can?
- Why?

1115
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,229
- This is November.
- What about it?

1116
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,600
- I see. Okay.
- You can do it.

1117
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,529
- You can definitely do it.
- You can do it.

1118
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,669
You can definitely make it.

1119
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,339
2025 KBS Entertainment Awards.

1120
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,340
The Grand Award goes to...

1121
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:37,010
He ate two citrons.

1122
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,869
The name has been announced up to Kim.

1123
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,009
- Kim.
- Kim.

1124
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,540
- Up to Jong has been said.
- Kim Jong.

1125
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,049
(Glorious days suddenly come to mind.)

1126
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,279
Do you know how powerful Jong Min is in November?

1127
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,979
You got married, and you can win the Grand Award.

1128
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,920
- That would be wonderful.
- What should you do in November?

1129
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,519
- I just have to eat two citrons?
- Of course.

1130
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,259
Jong Min in November will be shown in a clip.

1131
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,590
- Darn it.
- Get ready.

1132
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,760
The Grand Award in 2025 goes to...

1133
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,200
We said it up to Kim Jong.

1134
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,800
Start.

1135
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,999
(Rushing)

1136
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,170
No, that won't work.

1137
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,109
(He separates the seeds in 2 seconds.)

1138
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,410
It's possible.

1139
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,709
No one can stop Jong Min in November.

1140
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,379
No one can stop Jong Min in November.

1141
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,380
(He eats 1 in 10 seconds.)

1142
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:19,449
He's unstoppable.

1143
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,050
(Refilling the citron fast)

1144
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,849
- It's delicious.
- What are you doing?

1145
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,890
Chew them. What are you doing? Hurry up.

1146
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,620
- Hurry up.
- Hurry.

1147
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,989
- It's been 20 seconds.
- You have no time.

1148
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,889
- I have to eat it too.
- You're taking almost a minute.

1149
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,590
- I might not get to eat. Hurry.
- You're taking too much time.

1150
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,999
I might not get to eat. Hurry.

1151
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
(He stuffs his face with the next citron.)

1152
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:37,729
- That's impressive.
- You're using up one minute.

1153
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,229
(Overload)

1154
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,230
Hurry up.

1155
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,169
- Hurry, Jong Min.
- This is ridiculous.

1156
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,200
Hurry up.

1157
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,509
Hurry.

1158
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,510
(He's about to throw up.)

1159
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:46,669
- How many seconds?
- Forty seconds.

1160
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,840
Forty seconds.

1161
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,710
(He tries to whistle without swallowing everything.)

1162
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:50,810
Hurry up.

1163
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,450
- Forty-five seconds.
- He's doing very well.

1164
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,979
(His head is spinning from the sour taste.)

1165
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,290
- Never mind.
- Fifty seconds.

1166
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,720
- Time is up.
- It's over.

1167
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,189
- Failed.
- Oh, come on.

1168
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,859
- He did a good job.
- He did well.

1169
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,559
He wasn't acting. It's not easy.

1170
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,560
You did a good job.

1171
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,499
I couldn't swallow it.

1172
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
- I know.
- It's tough.

1173
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:11,730
You were eating a lot at once.

1174
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,970
I can't say that he did an outstanding job.

1175
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,769
He ate two citron so slowly while spitting out all the seeds.

1176
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,969
I don't like how he did it.

1177
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,339
He definitely spent more than a minute.

1178
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,440
(It seems like he failed on purpose.)

1179
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,350
(As Se Yoon expected, did he fail on purpose?)

1180
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,780
- He wasn't acting.
- How about 3 in 30 seconds?

1181
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,519
(A groundbreaking proposal)

1182
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,089
- Do you accept it or not?
- Se Yoon.

1183
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,889
There are people who are curious about it,

1184
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,519
- so could you just try it?
- No way.

1185
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,559
He can't do it for free.

1186
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,730
- I get paid for my eating shows.
- All right.

1187
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,589
He's a professional.

1188
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,629
Guys.

1189
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,000
- Look at the seeds.
- Look at the seeds.

1190
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,800
Look at the seeds.

1191
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:49,970
(Suddenly, it turns into a citron festival.)

1192
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,770
Look at the seeds.

1193
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,670
(This isn't allowed here.)

1194
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,279
What do you say? I can give it a try.

1195
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,879
The public is saying that I give you too many chances.

1196
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,979
But...

1197
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,519
You don't want to see Se Yoon eat it?

1198
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,580
Give us some citron tea.

1199
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,749
- Right.
- It's the least you can do.

1200
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,919
Then we'll give it to you...

1201
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,959
- after your meal.
- As a dessert.

1202
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,319
- Okay.
- Shall we go?

1203
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,030
- I don't think it's possible.
- I'll start when I'm ready.

1204
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,760
Please don't try this at home.

1205
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,529
- Don't try it at home.
- What did you say?

1206
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,230
- What?
- Don't try it at home.

1207
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,829
- I'm telling them not to try.
- Don't try this?

1208
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,539
It's possible for those who have done eating shows for ten years.

1209
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,599
- Only professionals can do it.
- Don't try it at home.

1210
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,240
Is this really possible?

1211
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,639
- Get ready, - Do your best.

1212
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,879
- set, go.
- You have to chew it all.

1213
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,550
(Start)

1214
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,180
He chewed the seeds.

1215
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,410
- Set, go.
- You have to chew it all.

1216
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,120
(The human blender is activated.)

1217
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,450
He's chewing the seeds.

1218
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:40,269
- He chewed the whole thing.
- He finished 1 in 5 seconds.

1219
00:39:40,298 --> 00:39:41,368
- Ready. Go.
- You should chew it all.

1220
00:39:42,398 --> 00:39:43,497
(The human blender is activated.)

1221
00:39:43,498 --> 00:39:44,837
He chewed the seeds.

1222
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:46,808
- I told you, he can do it.
- He just chewed the seeds.

1223
00:39:47,138 --> 00:39:50,007
- He chewed the whole thing.
- He finished 1 in 5 seconds.

1224
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:52,948
(He put all 3 in his mouth only in 8 seconds.)

1225
00:39:53,078 --> 00:39:54,177
He finished 1 in 5 seconds.

1226
00:39:54,178 --> 00:39:55,178
(Shocked)

1227
00:39:55,179 --> 00:39:56,277
He finished 1 in 5 seconds.

1228
00:39:56,278 --> 00:39:58,818
(He's on another level as we all know.)

1229
00:39:58,888 --> 00:40:00,017
How many seconds are left?

1230
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:01,018
Fifteen seconds.

1231
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:02,018
(He just has to swallow it and whistle to succeed.)

1232
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:04,127
He's amazing. It has a lot of seeds.

1233
00:40:04,128 --> 00:40:05,558
(He spits seeds out like a machine gun.)

1234
00:40:06,188 --> 00:40:08,127
(He does it one more time as everyone seems to like it.)

1235
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:10,968
- How many seconds have passed?
- Twenty-four, twenty-five,

1236
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:15,368
twenty-six, twenty-seven... Twenty-nine, thirty.

1237
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:18,438
(He succeeds in eating 3 citrons in 30 seconds.)

1238
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:20,808
(All members will get citron tea.)

1239
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:23,407
(Applauding in awe)

1240
00:40:23,408 --> 00:40:26,508
He finished the 1st one only in 5 seconds.

1241
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:30,118
- That was crazy.
- This is how you play a game.

1242
00:40:31,048 --> 00:40:32,417
It took him only five seconds.

1243
00:40:32,418 --> 00:40:33,647
(Super cool)

1244
00:40:33,648 --> 00:40:34,687
My, that was really cool.

1245
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:36,457
- Did I do okay?
- You're the best.

1246
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:37,458
(You're the best.)

1247
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:39,488
You failed to complete the mission.

1248
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:41,327
So you won't get a hint on Hungry Lupin.

1249
00:40:41,328 --> 00:40:44,527
- We'll do a brief interview.
- Okay.

1250
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:46,598
I'll slate. One, two, three.

1251
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:48,938
- Come for the interview.
- Okay.

1252
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,667
- That way? Okay.
- You were confident, right?

1253
00:40:50,668 --> 00:40:52,408
Okay, good. Shall we do it over there?

1254
00:40:52,608 --> 00:40:54,377
- Okay.
- Could you stand here for me?

1255
00:40:54,378 --> 00:40:55,478
Here?

1256
00:40:55,878 --> 00:40:57,077
This is interesting.

1257
00:40:57,078 --> 00:40:58,578
(They split up and begin their interviews.)

1258
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:03,347
(The staff comes up to Hungry Lupin during his interview.)

1259
00:41:03,348 --> 00:41:05,418
- Let me tell you something first.
- Okay.

1260
00:41:06,688 --> 00:41:08,957
You have to choose one member as the helper...

1261
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:10,588
who will assist you.

1262
00:41:11,328 --> 00:41:12,728
Oh, my. That's great.

1263
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:15,298
Whom will you choose as your helper?

1264
00:41:15,928 --> 00:41:19,498
(The helper, who will help Hungry Lupin, appeared.)

1265
00:41:20,198 --> 00:41:22,797
There's a helper to help Hungry Lupin now.

1266
00:41:22,798 --> 00:41:26,067
(Four citizens and one helper)

1267
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:28,277
The member who's been chosen as the helper by Hungry Lupin...

1268
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:29,638
will share the same fate with Hungry Lupin.

1269
00:41:32,178 --> 00:41:33,847
He will have to help Hungry Lupin...

1270
00:41:33,848 --> 00:41:37,148
so that Hungry Lupin doesn't get caught by the other citizens.

1271
00:41:39,448 --> 00:41:41,988
If Hungry Lupin is not caught at the end of the game,

1272
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:44,857
the helper will get to have dinner.

1273
00:41:44,858 --> 00:41:46,558
(The helper gains food.)

1274
00:41:47,628 --> 00:41:50,157
If Hungry Lupin is caught at the end of the game,

1275
00:41:50,158 --> 00:41:51,168
(Chosen as the culprit)

1276
00:41:51,368 --> 00:41:53,197
the helper can't have dinner.

1277
00:41:53,198 --> 00:41:54,238
(The citizens gain food.)

1278
00:41:54,968 --> 00:41:59,408
In brief, Hungry Lupin and the helper are on the same team now.

1279
00:42:00,908 --> 00:42:03,537
(Whom will Hungry Lupin choose?)

1280
00:42:03,538 --> 00:42:05,208
(I choose this person as my helper.)

1281
00:42:05,508 --> 00:42:06,908
With this member by my side,

1282
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:08,848
I'm sure I can prevent it.

1283
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:12,487
You have been chosen by Hungry Lupin...

1284
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,488
as his helper.

1285
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:14,488
(Who was chosen as Hungry Lupin's helper?)

1286
00:42:15,488 --> 00:42:17,217
Okay. Now we'll get going.

1287
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:18,458
(The helper selection and the interview ended.)

1288
00:42:18,528 --> 00:42:20,627
- Please do it.
- I'll do it.

1289
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:21,657
It's me

1290
00:42:21,658 --> 00:42:24,527
Do you guys know what Goheung is famous for?

1291
00:42:24,528 --> 00:42:25,528
- Goheung?
- Yes.

1292
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:26,997
- Goheung? I know something.
- What is it?

1293
00:42:26,998 --> 00:42:29,797
The Naro Space Center...

1294
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,508
- is located in Goheung.
- That's right.

1295
00:42:31,808 --> 00:42:35,337
(The Naro Space Center, Korea's first satellite launch site, )

1296
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:38,848
(is located in Goheung.)

1297
00:42:39,178 --> 00:42:40,178
How did you know that?

1298
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:41,747
In the drama "The Silent Sea,"

1299
00:42:41,748 --> 00:42:43,547
I had this line in a space scene.

1300
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:45,887
"This is Naro 11. Come in. Over."

1301
00:42:45,888 --> 00:42:47,587
- I had this line.
- I see.

1302
00:42:47,588 --> 00:42:50,828
So I watched a lot of space-related videos.

1303
00:42:51,128 --> 00:42:52,927
- For your information, - Yes.

1304
00:42:52,928 --> 00:42:55,797
Another rocket is scheduled to be launched from Goheung...

1305
00:42:55,798 --> 00:42:57,397
on November 27.

1306
00:42:57,398 --> 00:42:58,567
- Really?
- I see.

1307
00:42:58,568 --> 00:43:00,068
(Fascinated)

1308
00:43:00,168 --> 00:43:01,168
- That's amazing.
- At the end of November.

1309
00:43:01,169 --> 00:43:03,297
- It's amazing.
- Didn't they succeed recently?

1310
00:43:03,298 --> 00:43:05,738
- Nuri was successfully launched.
- That's right.

1311
00:43:05,763 --> 00:43:07,402
Anyway, who is Hungry Lupin?

1312
00:43:07,427 --> 00:43:08,557
I think it's Jong Min.

1313
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:10,875
- Why?
- I think...

1314
00:43:11,445 --> 00:43:12,944
- you were chosen as Hungry Lupin, - Yes?

1315
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:13,945
But then you forgot about that.

1316
00:43:13,945 --> 00:43:14,945
(Laughing)

1317
00:43:14,946 --> 00:43:16,684
(Dumbfounded)

1318
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:19,184
There's a very high probability that it's the case.

1319
00:43:19,185 --> 00:43:20,524
Jong Hyun would ask Jong Min,

1320
00:43:20,525 --> 00:43:23,255
"Jong Min, you do know you were chosen as Hungry Lupin, right?"

1321
00:43:23,725 --> 00:43:24,725
- Jong Min would say, "What? Me?"
- "Me?"

1322
00:43:25,225 --> 00:43:28,295
He'd be like, "Me? When did that happen?"

1323
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:30,935
- No, that's not the case.
- I'm suspicious of Jong Min.

1324
00:43:31,265 --> 00:43:34,464
I absolutely believe that it's DinDin. I'm sure of it.

1325
00:43:34,465 --> 00:43:36,035
He belittled me for no reason.

1326
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:38,074
He said there was no way I was Hungry Lupin...

1327
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:39,134
because I wasn't capable.

1328
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,274
- Sorry for suspecting you, DinDin.
- Okay.

1329
00:43:41,275 --> 00:43:42,804
But the DinDin I know...

1330
00:43:42,805 --> 00:43:44,214
would get mad and deny the suspicion.

1331
00:43:44,215 --> 00:43:45,515
- Right.
- But he's been so quiet.

1332
00:43:45,715 --> 00:43:49,244
- Is it because he's changed or...
- He's now a thoughtful celebrity.

1333
00:43:49,245 --> 00:43:50,484
I'm not sure what's happening.

1334
00:43:50,485 --> 00:43:52,214
He would keep trying to convince us that he's not Hungry Lupin,

1335
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:55,054
- Right. You felt that too, right?
- but he's been too calm.

1336
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:56,484
Because it's so obvious that I'm not Hungry Lupin,

1337
00:43:56,485 --> 00:43:58,324
I can't find any grounds on which to deny the suspicion.

1338
00:43:58,325 --> 00:44:00,795
He's trying to convince everyone that you're Hungry Lupin.

1339
00:44:01,095 --> 00:44:02,364
Whom do you suspect the most?

1340
00:44:02,365 --> 00:44:04,264
- I suspect you.
- Me?

1341
00:44:04,265 --> 00:44:05,664
- Even if it was hard to eat, - Right.

1342
00:44:05,665 --> 00:44:07,704
It's still absurd that he talked while eating it.

1343
00:44:07,705 --> 00:44:11,474
(He seemed absolutely suspicious at the citron farm.)

1344
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:14,075
It didn't seem to work, so I gave up and talked.

1345
00:44:14,105 --> 00:44:17,644
I shoot a video with Joon for "Workman" from time to time.

1346
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:20,145
He works really hard when he's given a task.

1347
00:44:20,415 --> 00:44:22,714
He puts his life on it even when it's really exhausting.

1348
00:44:22,715 --> 00:44:24,755
But he couldn't eat a citron?

1349
00:44:25,115 --> 00:44:28,024
- That makes no sense.
- I work even harder on this show.

1350
00:44:28,025 --> 00:44:29,284
By the way, Hungry Lupin is supposed...

1351
00:44:29,285 --> 00:44:30,595
to try not to succeed when playing a game, right?

1352
00:44:30,895 --> 00:44:33,495
Joon, I can't believe you just said such a thing.

1353
00:44:33,595 --> 00:44:35,524
- Gosh, seriously.
- Do you have to go that far?

1354
00:44:35,525 --> 00:44:37,864
It just crossed my mind. That's all.

1355
00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:39,795
Wasn't what he just said ridiculous?

1356
00:44:40,965 --> 00:44:43,774
- What was that?
- Exactly. I'm dumbfounded.

1357
00:44:43,775 --> 00:44:45,534
He wouldn't seem so suspicious if he stayed quiet.

1358
00:44:45,535 --> 00:44:47,845
Why would he say such a thing? Edit that part out.

1359
00:44:48,545 --> 00:44:50,144
- Don't look down on me.
- Your comment will make people...

1360
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,614
believe you're Hungry Lupin and switch channels.

1361
00:44:51,615 --> 00:44:52,674
- I also...
- Oh, gosh.

1362
00:44:52,675 --> 00:44:55,584
Joon, just admit that you're Hungry Lupin.

1363
00:44:55,585 --> 00:44:58,354
I guess DinDin is sure that Joon is Hungry Lupin.

1364
00:44:58,355 --> 00:44:59,755
Suddenly,

1365
00:45:00,525 --> 00:45:01,655
I want to believe Joon.

1366
00:45:03,055 --> 00:45:04,925
I mean, he often talks nonsense as he just did.

1367
00:45:05,355 --> 00:45:06,894
He seems suspicious because of the situation,

1368
00:45:06,895 --> 00:45:07,995
but he usually behaves that way.

1369
00:45:08,095 --> 00:45:10,465
I'd be so sad if I was Hungry Lupin.

1370
00:45:11,195 --> 00:45:14,065
I'm getting more confused because of our conversations.

1371
00:45:15,105 --> 00:45:17,234
- Sae Ho, who do you think it is?
- Whom do you suspect?

1372
00:45:17,235 --> 00:45:19,775
- It's hard to tell.
- I suspect DinDin and Chang Seon.

1373
00:45:20,405 --> 00:45:22,975
- Wasn't it obvious?
- I don't think it's Joon. If so...

1374
00:45:23,145 --> 00:45:25,514
That'd mean he totally fooled me this time.

1375
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:26,614
Really? Then whom do you suspect?

1376
00:45:26,615 --> 00:45:28,014
As I said earlier, I suspect DinDin.

1377
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:29,944
- DinDin?
- It's either Seon Ho or Lim Cheol.

1378
00:45:29,945 --> 00:45:31,855
- I'm not...
- Come on.

1379
00:45:32,385 --> 00:45:33,385
(Se Yoon is simply excited about eating food.)

1380
00:45:33,385 --> 00:45:34,385
Good.

1381
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:36,555
Today's lunch...

1382
00:45:36,585 --> 00:45:39,224
has the rich flavor of the clean sea of Goheung.

1383
00:45:39,225 --> 00:45:40,354
You'll have the sea set meal.

1384
00:45:40,355 --> 00:45:41,495
(The Goheung sea set meal)

1385
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:43,294
The South Sea is really incredible.

1386
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,965
(The dishes made with seafood caught in the clean South Sea)

1387
00:45:45,195 --> 00:45:46,665
Whole eel stew,

1388
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:49,334
- grilled eel, - Oh, my.

1389
00:45:49,335 --> 00:45:50,575
And seasoned raw tongue sole will be served.

1390
00:45:51,005 --> 00:45:52,075
Seasoned raw tongue sole.

1391
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,304
(The Goheung sea set meal will invigorate the members.)

1392
00:45:55,305 --> 00:45:56,305
- It sounds amazing.
- You know...

1393
00:45:56,306 --> 00:45:58,175
He said "whole eel stew."

1394
00:45:58,415 --> 00:46:00,785
- Does it have a whole eel?
- Is it whole eel stew?

1395
00:46:01,245 --> 00:46:04,255
(Correct. A whole eel is in it without being ground.)

1396
00:46:04,355 --> 00:46:05,455
What is tongue sole?

1397
00:46:05,615 --> 00:46:07,054
- It's the name of a fish.
- Right, tongue sole.

1398
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,185
- Flatfish and tongue sole.
- I see.

1399
00:46:08,385 --> 00:46:11,625
(Raw tongue sole mixed with a sauce is also one of the best delicacies.)

1400
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:14,295
- I'll be sure to eat those dishes.
- I can tell they make great food.

1401
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:17,094
Through this game with lunch on the line,

1402
00:46:17,095 --> 00:46:19,764
we'll see how observant the detectives are.

1403
00:46:19,765 --> 00:46:21,564
It's Magnifier Food Quiz.

1404
00:46:21,565 --> 00:46:23,464
(The lunch mission, Magnifier Food Quiz)

1405
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:24,835
- Exactly.
- This is an individual game.

1406
00:46:25,205 --> 00:46:27,175
- I'm really bad at this game.
- I like team games.

1407
00:46:27,205 --> 00:46:30,374
You'll see part of a photo of food that's enlarged on three levels...

1408
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:32,574
and guess what food it is.

1409
00:46:32,575 --> 00:46:34,784
(Level 2, marinated crab)

1410
00:46:34,785 --> 00:46:36,885
(Level 3, large intestine over rice)

1411
00:46:37,015 --> 00:46:39,415
(The answer is large intestine over rice.)

1412
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,924
Only the top three members who got the most right answers...

1413
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,125
will get to eat food.

1414
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:45,355
The member who places first...

1415
00:46:45,425 --> 00:46:47,294
will be given a hint on Hungry Lupin.

1416
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,194
- That's good for all of us.
- Right.

1417
00:46:49,195 --> 00:46:51,834
If the member who got the hint gets the right answer,

1418
00:46:51,835 --> 00:46:53,095
will he get food?

1419
00:46:53,635 --> 00:46:54,665
- Pardon?
- What did you say?

1420
00:46:55,235 --> 00:46:57,064
- What did you say?
- Seriously, Jong Min...

1421
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:59,135
Don't get me wrong. Go wash your face with cold water.

1422
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:00,575
This is not good.

1423
00:47:01,005 --> 00:47:02,944
Wash your face with cold water or something like that.

1424
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,244
- Shall I spray water on you?
- Right. No, that's okay.

1425
00:47:05,245 --> 00:47:06,245
- Are you good?
- Yes.

1426
00:47:06,246 --> 00:47:07,844
What if Hungry Lupin places first?

1427
00:47:07,845 --> 00:47:09,244
- If Hungry Lupin places first...
- Why are you asking that?

1428
00:47:09,245 --> 00:47:10,955
He will get the hint.

1429
00:47:11,085 --> 00:47:12,654
- But...
- He may lie to us.

1430
00:47:12,655 --> 00:47:13,855
(Hungry Lupin can lie about the hint.)

1431
00:47:14,025 --> 00:47:16,284
So if Hungry Lupin places first, there will be no problem.

1432
00:47:16,285 --> 00:47:18,055
- Joon seems very curious about it.
- Why? Tell us.

1433
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:20,355
- It doesn't make sense.
- He's acting suspicious again.

1434
00:47:20,765 --> 00:47:22,364
- He's acting suspicious again.
- I mean...

1435
00:47:22,365 --> 00:47:23,895
- I was suspecting DinDin, but...
- It's strange.

1436
00:47:23,935 --> 00:47:25,965
- Come on, Joon.
- Are you making it obvious now?

1437
00:47:25,995 --> 00:47:28,004
- Hungry Lupin wouldn't ask that.
- Hey.

1438
00:47:28,005 --> 00:47:29,104
So it doesn't make any sense.

1439
00:47:29,105 --> 00:47:31,804
Maybe he asked the question because he didn't understand the rules.

1440
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:32,805
- Right.
- Right.

1441
00:47:32,806 --> 00:47:34,274
- Okay. Now...
- Can we practice first?

1442
00:47:34,275 --> 00:47:35,275
We'll give you a practice question.

1443
00:47:35,276 --> 00:47:37,444
How about we get one bite of food if we get it right?

1444
00:47:37,445 --> 00:47:38,544
What about one piece of grilled eel?

1445
00:47:38,545 --> 00:47:40,175
- Sounds great.
- That'd be great.

1446
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,045
Here goes the practice question.

1447
00:47:42,185 --> 00:47:43,714
(The practice quiz begins.)

1448
00:47:43,715 --> 00:47:44,884
Isn't that a pimple?

1449
00:47:44,885 --> 00:47:46,285
It looks a bit disgusting.

1450
00:47:46,485 --> 00:47:48,354
I've seen a photo like this at a dermatology clinic.

1451
00:47:48,355 --> 00:47:49,554
- What is that?
- Let me answer.

1452
00:47:49,555 --> 00:47:50,724
(It's an enlarged image.)

1453
00:47:50,725 --> 00:47:54,525
(What food could this be?)

1454
00:47:54,565 --> 00:47:55,664
I see some chili oil.

1455
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:57,225
It has chili oil on it, so it must be a Chinese dish.

1456
00:47:57,295 --> 00:47:58,494
I think it's a Chinese dish...

1457
00:47:58,495 --> 00:48:00,835
- based on the chili oil.
- Sae Ho. Crab egg foo young.

1458
00:48:01,105 --> 00:48:02,164
- Se Yoon.
- Go ahead.

1459
00:48:02,165 --> 00:48:03,235
Guobaorou.

1460
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:04,735
- Incorrect.
- Seon Ho.

1461
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:06,135
- Is it incorrect?
- Malatang.

1462
00:48:06,605 --> 00:48:07,605
- Incorrect.
- What is that?

1463
00:48:07,606 --> 00:48:09,074
- What is it?
- Moving on to the next hint.

1464
00:48:09,075 --> 00:48:10,205
We'll get the next hint.

1465
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,074
It's Level Two.

1466
00:48:12,075 --> 00:48:14,314
(Level 2 shows a bigger part of the image.)

1467
00:48:14,315 --> 00:48:16,445
(What food could this be?)

1468
00:48:16,945 --> 00:48:18,615
- Joon.
- What?

1469
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,355
What are you waiting for? Say the answer.

1470
00:48:22,055 --> 00:48:23,185
Pepperoni pizza.

1471
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:25,055
- Incorrect.
- Jong Min.

1472
00:48:25,056 --> 00:48:26,394
- Seon Ho.
- Jong Min, go ahead.

1473
00:48:26,395 --> 00:48:27,395
Cheese tteokbokki.

1474
00:48:27,995 --> 00:48:28,995
Correct.

1475
00:48:29,495 --> 00:48:31,765
- Okay.
- Oh, yes!

1476
00:48:32,695 --> 00:48:35,365
(The answer is cheese tteokbokki.)

1477
00:48:35,465 --> 00:48:37,064
Oh, it was cheese tteokbokki.

1478
00:48:37,065 --> 00:48:38,734
It looked like some kind of soup, right?

1479
00:48:38,735 --> 00:48:41,005
- I saw the rice cake at the bottom.
- Right.

1480
00:48:41,205 --> 00:48:43,605
- This will be difficult.
- Can you show us Level One?

1481
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,775
(But then...)

1482
00:48:44,776 --> 00:48:47,245
(Picking up)

1483
00:48:47,545 --> 00:48:48,644
(Siren wailing)

1484
00:48:48,645 --> 00:48:49,845
What's going on?

1485
00:48:50,585 --> 00:48:55,555
(The siren sound wails suddenly?)

1486
00:48:56,055 --> 00:48:57,124
What's going on?

1487
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:58,594
(Team Security appears.)

1488
00:48:58,595 --> 00:49:00,094
- What's going on?
- Me?

1489
00:49:00,095 --> 00:49:03,165
- What's going on? Why?
- Why is he taking me away?

1490
00:49:03,695 --> 00:49:05,295
- Why?
- What's happening?

1491
00:49:05,655 --> 00:49:06,885
- What is he doing?
- Why?

1492
00:49:06,918 --> 00:49:08,417
(The security team has arrived.)

1493
00:49:08,418 --> 00:49:09,828
- What's going on?
- Is it me?

1494
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:12,588
- What's happening?
- Why is he dragging me?

1495
00:49:13,498 --> 00:49:15,158
- What? What's going on?
- Why is he doing this?

1496
00:49:15,628 --> 00:49:17,027
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

1497
00:49:17,028 --> 00:49:18,267
- What's going on?
- What happened?

1498
00:49:18,268 --> 00:49:21,344
- What did he do?
- I didn't do anything.

1499
00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:22,709
I didn't do anything, you saw me!

1500
00:49:23,823 --> 00:49:25,123
Hungry Lupin... I'm hungry!

1501
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:27,829
What are you doing?

1502
00:49:28,229 --> 00:49:29,359
I just got the question right.

1503
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:31,268
What's going on?

1504
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:33,228
Did he take Jong Min because he got the answer?

1505
00:49:33,229 --> 00:49:34,299
It has nothing to do with that?

1506
00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:36,369
- Wait a second.
- What did Jong Min say?

1507
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:37,568
(Dumbfounded)

1508
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:38,669
What did Jong Min say?

1509
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,309
We can't say anything then.

1510
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:44,209
- What did he even say?
- He wasn't doing his best?

1511
00:49:44,379 --> 00:49:45,379
(Is it because he wasn't doing his best on the show?)

1512
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,149
Did you just eliminate the worst player or what?

1513
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:49,018
- What's happening?
- What was that?

1514
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,388
Let's keep the seat vacant because it's unlucky there.

1515
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:51,819
- Goodness.
- No, it can't be happening.

1516
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,019
It's so funny how he got out after he got the answer right.

1517
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:56,619
He can't eat then.

1518
00:49:58,159 --> 00:49:59,159
What's going on?

1519
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:01,259
I was supposed to have a bite because I got the question right.

1520
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,299
- We'll take off now.
- Where are we going?

1521
00:50:05,029 --> 00:50:06,069
What's going on?

1522
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:07,438
Why are you doing this?

1523
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:08,439
(The van is setting off without knowing the destination.)

1524
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,208
What did I even do? I didn't do anything wrong.

1525
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:11,509
(A procession full of questions)

1526
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:12,939
(All I did was...)

1527
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,039
Cheese tteokbokki.

1528
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:15,608
That is correct.

1529
00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:17,249
(I just got the question right, that is all.)

1530
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:18,508
You didn't have your bite there?

1531
00:50:18,509 --> 00:50:21,179
No! I was supposed to have a bite because I got the question right.

1532
00:50:22,249 --> 00:50:23,519
Bad timing.

1533
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:28,488
(What's the truth behind Jong Min getting eliminated?)

1534
00:50:28,489 --> 00:50:29,489
- Jong Hyun.
- Yes?

1535
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:30,558
He didn't go because he got the answer, did he?

1536
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:31,829
- That's not true.
- You sure?

1537
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,698
You're not telling us the reason?

1538
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:36,728
- You will know the reason later.
- Okay.

1539
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:37,898
Let's play the game now.

1540
00:50:37,899 --> 00:50:39,968
Here is your question.

1541
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:41,339
(The winner exclusively gets the hint for Hungry Lupin.)

1542
00:50:41,799 --> 00:50:46,608
(What is this food?)

1543
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:47,879
That must be garlic.

1544
00:50:48,409 --> 00:50:50,179
Seon Ho, aglio e olio pasta.

1545
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:51,979
Incorrect.

1546
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:55,279
They zoomed in the picture, garlic can't be that big.

1547
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:56,648
That must be a sesame seed.

1548
00:50:56,649 --> 00:50:58,048
- Right, it's a sesame seed.
- Sesame seed.

1549
00:50:58,049 --> 00:50:59,988
- It is a sesame seed.
- Right, it's a sesame seed.

1550
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:01,219
So it's food.

1551
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:03,318
- Seon Ho.
- Yes.

1552
00:51:03,319 --> 00:51:04,458
A hamburger.

1553
00:51:04,459 --> 00:51:05,858
(A hamburger)

1554
00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:07,299
- It must be the answer.
- Correct.

1555
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:09,958
I knew it was...

1556
00:51:09,959 --> 00:51:11,999
a burger with patties and a bun on top.

1557
00:51:12,499 --> 00:51:13,998
(This sesame seed image, enlarged 160 times, is...)

1558
00:51:13,999 --> 00:51:17,268
(A burger with sesame seeds on top)

1559
00:51:17,269 --> 00:51:18,768
Se Yoon mentioning sesame seeds...

1560
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:20,478
- You gave a big hint.
- I know.

1561
00:51:20,479 --> 00:51:22,539
Here is the second question.

1562
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:23,849
Here it is.

1563
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:26,478
- Goodness.
- It must be soup.

1564
00:51:26,479 --> 00:51:27,679
It looks like soup.

1565
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,948
(Soup...)

1566
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:30,949
- Joon.
- Yes.

1567
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:32,019
Sundae soup.

1568
00:51:32,449 --> 00:51:33,859
- That must be the answer.
- For real?

1569
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:36,719
(It must be the answer.)

1570
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:37,828
- Correct.
- Goodness.

1571
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:38,829
(Joon got the answer.)

1572
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,359
(He guessed the menu right away after he learned that it's a soup.)

1573
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,699
Zoomed out two notches.

1574
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:47,169
- Three notches.
- It's totally sundae.

1575
00:51:47,669 --> 00:51:48,968
(The best soup there possible, sundae soup.)

1576
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:50,368
Joon earned a point.

1577
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:52,108
Joon got the answer? My gosh, this is humiliating.

1578
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,269
That puts me in a bad position.

1579
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:55,779
All right, here is the third question.

1580
00:51:57,109 --> 00:51:59,509
(Green garnish on top of yellow food?)

1581
00:51:59,879 --> 00:52:01,519
(He can't even take a guess.)

1582
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,789
(Is that green thing parsley?)

1583
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:05,019
Seon Ho, steamed eggs?

1584
00:52:05,419 --> 00:52:06,619
- Incorrect.
- DinDin.

1585
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:08,059
Egg tart.

1586
00:52:08,189 --> 00:52:09,319
Incorrect.

1587
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,158
- That was very sharp.
- Se Yoon.

1588
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:12,989
I think it's zoomed in a lot.

1589
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,158
Pumpkin cream soup...

1590
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:17,798
and parsley on top.

1591
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:20,129
Pumpkin cream soup.

1592
00:52:20,499 --> 00:52:22,798
- Incorrect.
- Zoom out.

1593
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:24,639
- I'll zoom out now.
- Okay, zoom out.

1594
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,508
- What can this be?
- What is this?

1595
00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:28,808
(A glimmer of bronzed food peeked through the opening)

1596
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:31,949
(It's made with at least three ingredients or more.)

1597
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,379
I see cheese peeking out.

1598
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:35,119
Sae Ho. It's a hamburg steak.

1599
00:52:35,879 --> 00:52:36,979
Incorrect.

1600
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,519
Se Yoon.

1601
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:43,259
That's jjajang ramyeon and cheese on top.

1602
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,498
What's it called in a short form?

1603
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:48,899
- I know.
- DinDin.

1604
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,328
Hey, this one.

1605
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:52,429
Jjajang ramyeon, egg, and cheese.

1606
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,869
- It must be the answer.
- That is correct.

1607
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:55,299
What is that?

1608
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,338
(Se Yoon got the answer.)

1609
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,168
Yes, it's that jjajang ramyeon with egg and cheese.

1610
00:52:58,169 --> 00:53:00,708
Jjajang ramyeon with egg and cheese on top.

1611
00:53:00,709 --> 00:53:02,208
It actually is a menu.

1612
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:04,478
- You can find it in cafeterias.
- Really?

1613
00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:06,108
It's a popular dish among young people.

1614
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:07,819
- Jjajang with egg and cheese.
- That's right.

1615
00:53:07,979 --> 00:53:09,348
Here is the fourth question.

1616
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:10,849
(Leveling up the difficulty for the fourth question)

1617
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:12,889
(Sighing)

1618
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:15,318
(Why did they all sigh?)

1619
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:17,388
- This is crazy.
- What can this be?

1620
00:53:17,389 --> 00:53:18,829
My stomach is growling.

1621
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:21,659
(A glossy brown dish)

1622
00:53:21,729 --> 00:53:22,929
Seon Ho, jokbal.

1623
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,369
- Incorrect.
- DinDin.

1624
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,868
(Thinking)

1625
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:27,999
A strawberry cake.

1626
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:29,338
- Strawberries?
- Incorrect.

1627
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,009
- It looks like a strawberry.
- I can't tell from this.

1628
00:53:31,939 --> 00:53:33,569
Will any of us get this right?

1629
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:35,309
I don't think so.

1630
00:53:36,139 --> 00:53:38,208
- I'm sure you have eaten this.
- Right.

1631
00:53:38,209 --> 00:53:40,979
(Revealing the photo after zooming out)

1632
00:53:42,649 --> 00:53:43,848
Oh, the name of this...

1633
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:45,718
I don't know the name of this.

1634
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:47,919
- I think the name was...
- It must be...

1635
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,929
(Half a year ago, while filming Six Jong Min Special)

1636
00:53:51,459 --> 00:53:53,759
(All of them loved this dessert.)

1637
00:53:54,029 --> 00:53:56,458
(He ate it so happily, yet...)

1638
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:58,228
- The name...
- When did we eat that?

1639
00:53:58,229 --> 00:53:59,269
The name!

1640
00:53:59,729 --> 00:54:00,899
Dried persimmon with cheese.

1641
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:03,969
- It's something like that.
- DinDin! I know.

1642
00:54:04,169 --> 00:54:06,209
(Here is the answer.)

1643
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:08,339
(This dish that evokes the appearance of jokbal)

1644
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:10,978
(Dried persimmon roll with cream cheese)

1645
00:54:10,979 --> 00:54:12,149
- DinDin.
- Incorrect.

1646
00:54:12,379 --> 00:54:14,049
Cream cheese and dried persimmon...

1647
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:16,149
Cream cheese with walnuts and persimmon.

1648
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:17,919
- Incorrect.
- Joon.

1649
00:54:18,419 --> 00:54:19,488
(Shouted by all in the nick of time)

1650
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,489
- Seon Ho.
- Let's try.

1651
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,788
Seon Ho was faster.

1652
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:22,789
Seon Ho.

1653
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,959
Dried persimmon bits with cream cheese.

1654
00:54:25,389 --> 00:54:26,489
Incorrect.

1655
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,299
It is with cream cheese. But how does it look?

1656
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,699
It looks like this.

1657
00:54:33,529 --> 00:54:34,939
(Like this?)

1658
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:36,139
Delicious?

1659
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:37,839
What is it?

1660
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:39,539
- It's rolled.
- Se Yoon.

1661
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:41,579
Rolled.

1662
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,179
(That's the name!)

1663
00:54:43,439 --> 00:54:45,809
Dried persimmon...

1664
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,979
with cream cheese.

1665
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:49,618
Sae Ho, Sae Ho!

1666
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,788
- Incorrect.
- Sae Ho.

1667
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:54,059
Dried persimmon roll with cream cheese.

1668
00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:56,188
DinDin!

1669
00:54:56,189 --> 00:54:57,258
That is correct.

1670
00:54:57,259 --> 00:54:58,658
What is it called? Cream cheese?

1671
00:54:58,659 --> 00:54:59,659
Dried persimmon roll.

1672
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,098
(The game is over when Joon hasn't even spoken a word.)

1673
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:02,858
I need to get at least two more questions.

1674
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:03,868
(Sae Ho 1, Seon Ho 1, Se Yoon 1 Joon 1, DinDin 0)

1675
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:06,628
This food...

1676
00:55:06,629 --> 00:55:09,039
- I'm sure you all know this.
- Okay, it must be popular.

1677
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:11,208
It's sweating.

1678
00:55:11,209 --> 00:55:12,368
(Tiny drops of water)

1679
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:14,378
- It's sweating.
- It looks like a human finger.

1680
00:55:14,379 --> 00:55:15,379
(Scared)

1681
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:16,379
- Sae Ho.
- Yes.

1682
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,708
- Pork skin.
- Incorrect.

1683
00:55:17,709 --> 00:55:18,779
- It's not?
- Joon.

1684
00:55:18,879 --> 00:55:20,878
The surface has some oil.

1685
00:55:20,879 --> 00:55:22,479
This is what I think.

1686
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,388
It looks like oil or cheese.

1687
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:27,388
It does look like fat. However, I feel...

1688
00:55:27,389 --> 00:55:28,819
that those are noodles.

1689
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:31,429
(Oily)

1690
00:55:31,489 --> 00:55:32,528
- Joon.
- Yes?

1691
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:33,559
Aglio e olio.

1692
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:36,228
Correct.

1693
00:55:36,229 --> 00:55:37,269
That's a shrimp.

1694
00:55:37,999 --> 00:55:40,739
(Se Yoon has been giving hints to everybody.)

1695
00:55:40,999 --> 00:55:42,138
- That's a shrimp.
- I see.

1696
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,498
Please show us the original picture.

1697
00:55:43,499 --> 00:55:45,569
(It's that grease on top of the aglio e olio shrimp.)

1698
00:55:45,669 --> 00:55:47,579
Here is the sixth question.

1699
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:48,908
- What is that?
- This is...

1700
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:50,279
Are you kidding me?

1701
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:52,278
Whoever gets the answer is the weird one.

1702
00:55:52,279 --> 00:55:54,348
- Sae Ho.
- Yes.

1703
00:55:54,349 --> 00:55:55,378
Salt bread?

1704
00:55:55,379 --> 00:55:56,379
(Salt bread)

1705
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,849
- It must be the answer.
- He's right.

1706
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,148
(Eyes shaking)

1707
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:01,319
- It must be correct.
- That is correct.

1708
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,229
That's amazing.

1709
00:56:04,289 --> 00:56:05,728
- That's salt.
- It's salt.

1710
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:07,028
- That's salt.
- How is that salt?

1711
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:09,599
- That's bread on the bottom.
- Salt crystals on top.

1712
00:56:10,129 --> 00:56:11,168
- Goodness.
- Salt bread.

1713
00:56:11,169 --> 00:56:12,669
(Sae Ho got the answer after only seeing the salt crystal.)

1714
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:13,868
That was crazy.

1715
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:15,538
(Sae Ho and Joon are the co-winners.)

1716
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:16,869
Okay, this is making me scared.

1717
00:56:17,309 --> 00:56:19,509
Here is the seventh question.

1718
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:21,979
What is that?

1719
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,448
- Seon Ho, it's hot pot.
- What?

1720
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:26,149
- Hot pot.
- Incorrect.

1721
00:56:26,179 --> 00:56:28,179
The next hint is...

1722
00:56:29,779 --> 00:56:32,018
(They can now see some vegetables and fruit.)

1723
00:56:32,019 --> 00:56:33,049
Se Yoon.

1724
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:34,559
Tomyumgoong.

1725
00:56:36,089 --> 00:56:37,219
I thought of that too.

1726
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:39,029
That is correct.

1727
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:41,129
(I should have gone for it.)

1728
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:43,129
I'm sorry.

1729
00:56:43,229 --> 00:56:45,298
- Well, this wraps up...
- I'm sorry.

1730
00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:47,228
Joon, Sae Ho, and Se Yoon...

1731
00:56:47,229 --> 00:56:48,699
- can eat.
- Goodness.

1732
00:56:49,899 --> 00:56:51,368
(Joon went from last place to grab a meal in no time.)

1733
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:53,339
We will play the final round.

1734
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:55,708
This will decide the winner.

1735
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:56,978
(A first-place battle to decide the hint recipient)

1736
00:56:56,979 --> 00:56:58,378
I'm not Hungry Lupin.

1737
00:56:58,379 --> 00:57:00,079
So it would be nice if you make me the winner.

1738
00:57:00,379 --> 00:57:02,649
You two are the most suspicious ones.

1739
00:57:02,879 --> 00:57:03,988
And you are here.

1740
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:05,948
This is a very good chance to see who Hungry Lupin is.

1741
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:07,658
- I mean...
- Let's eat.

1742
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:09,518
I'll share with you, Seon Ho.

1743
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:11,088
You have to share the hint to get Hungry Lupin.

1744
00:57:11,089 --> 00:57:12,758
- Joon, let me be the winner.
- Of course, we have to share.

1745
00:57:12,759 --> 00:57:14,598
- I mean it.
- He might lie.

1746
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:16,359
- I won't lie, I mean it.
- All right.

1747
00:57:16,829 --> 00:57:18,328
Here is the question.

1748
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:19,429
(The final round that will decide the winner who gets the hint)

1749
00:57:19,629 --> 00:57:21,099
- What is that?
- I think I can guess what it is.

1750
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,038
- What is it?
- I think it's white soup.

1751
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,409
- It must be mixed with...
- It also has chili oil on top.

1752
00:57:30,379 --> 00:57:31,949
Joon, seolleongtang.

1753
00:57:32,379 --> 00:57:33,409
Incorrect.

1754
00:57:33,979 --> 00:57:35,378
I have no idea.

1755
00:57:35,379 --> 00:57:36,549
I see some textures.

1756
00:57:37,689 --> 00:57:39,789
(This is difficult.)

1757
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:40,858
We zoomed it out.

1758
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:41,888
(Revealing the picture as it's zoomed out)

1759
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:42,889
Here you go.

1760
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,529
(Noodles served in a light, clear soup)

1761
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:48,299
- Sae Ho.
- Joon.

1762
00:57:48,329 --> 00:57:49,329
Gosh, it's easy.

1763
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,629
- You have to say it correctly.
- Don't miss your chance.

1764
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:52,799
Sae Ho.

1765
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,099
Mul makguksu.

1766
00:57:54,469 --> 00:57:55,599
- What?
- What are you doing?

1767
00:57:56,299 --> 00:57:58,409
(How can he miss this?)

1768
00:57:58,539 --> 00:57:59,668
- Incorrect.
- Joon.

1769
00:57:59,669 --> 00:58:00,779
- Here is your chance.
- Naengmyeon.

1770
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,779
You are missing this?

1771
00:58:05,509 --> 00:58:06,649
Joon got the answer.

1772
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:09,778
I thought it was cold buckwheat noodles.

1773
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:11,749
I thought it was arrowroot cold noodles.

1774
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:14,588
- But it's all right.
- Joon got the hint.

1775
00:58:14,589 --> 00:58:16,418
You aren't Hungry Lupin, are you?

1776
00:58:16,419 --> 00:58:17,459
What?

1777
00:58:17,729 --> 00:58:19,728
I should have gotten the hint.

1778
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:20,729
(Hungry Lupin can't have the hint.)

1779
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:21,929
You are right.

1780
00:58:22,029 --> 00:58:23,429
Let's trust Joon for now.

1781
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:26,728
- Please share with us the hint.
- It must be Joon.

1782
00:58:26,729 --> 00:58:27,999
Then he would lie to us.

1783
00:58:28,269 --> 00:58:29,669
Isn't Jong Min coming?

1784
00:58:30,439 --> 00:58:32,069
His name is there. I feel bad for him.

1785
00:58:32,569 --> 00:58:33,608
(Jong Min was brought to this place without any explanation.)

1786
00:58:33,609 --> 00:58:34,739
It's an event location.

1787
00:58:36,979 --> 00:58:40,109
(When the citron turns golden, )

1788
00:58:41,379 --> 00:58:45,749
(this place bustles with visitors.)

1789
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:47,589
(Goheung Citron Festival)

1790
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,089
There's a citron festival here.

1791
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:51,789
Why did you bring me here?

1792
00:58:51,859 --> 00:58:54,759
From now on, you'll earn your own allowance...

1793
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:57,098
- and buy your own lunch.
- My allowance?

1794
00:58:57,099 --> 00:58:59,499
You will change into a human citron now...

1795
00:58:59,729 --> 00:59:02,438
and take photos with the tourists...

1796
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:04,068
who came to the citron festival.

1797
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:05,339
(Taking pictures with the tourists)

1798
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:08,408
You'll get 10 cents for every person you take a photo with.

1799
00:59:08,409 --> 00:59:09,808
- Ten cents?
- Yes.

1800
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:11,349
How many pictures am I supposed to take?

1801
00:59:11,509 --> 00:59:12,848
Let's get changed.

1802
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:15,319
I'd need at least 50 dollars for a meal.

1803
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:16,819
Okay.

1804
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,619
(Jong Min is turning into a human citron.)

1805
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:20,958
(Laughing)

1806
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,258
Is this okay?

1807
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:23,789
- It's okay.
- Is it okay?

1808
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:25,129
Is this right?

1809
00:59:25,189 --> 00:59:27,229
(Laughing)

1810
00:59:28,459 --> 00:59:31,369
(Revealing Citron Jong Min)

1811
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:32,669
Let's go.

1812
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:34,839
I'm going to earn money.

1813
00:59:36,669 --> 00:59:39,009
(He starts earning his allowance.)

1814
00:59:39,569 --> 00:59:41,439
Do I have to take photos with people?

1815
00:59:42,739 --> 00:59:43,739
With people?

1816
00:59:44,479 --> 00:59:46,209
Shall we take a picture together?

1817
00:59:46,379 --> 00:59:47,918
Really?

1818
00:59:47,919 --> 00:59:49,279
(He attempts to appeal as the photo subject.)

1819
00:59:50,419 --> 00:59:51,818
- Thank you.
- Can I take one too?

1820
00:59:51,819 --> 00:59:52,848
Sure.

1821
00:59:52,849 --> 00:59:54,258
- Two, three.
- Let's take a picture.

1822
00:59:54,259 --> 00:59:55,459
Thank you.

1823
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,329
(Photo requests continue to come.)

1824
00:59:59,089 --> 01:00:00,488
The best!

(Taking a picture with a cute baby)

1826
01:00:02,759 --> 01:00:04,268
(He's not popular with babies.)

1827
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:05,299
Hi.

1828
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:07,369
I'm a citron.

1829
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,438
- He's Kim Jong Min.
- I guess he's very scared.

1830
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,969
(citron feels awkward.)

1831
01:00:11,669 --> 01:00:13,868
(He took pictures with 9 people in no time.)

1832
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:16,408
Hold on. I should first check the food.

1833
01:00:16,409 --> 01:00:18,149
(He first checks the prices of the food.)

1834
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:19,808

(Delicacies that delight your sight and taste)

1837
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:27,419
There are so many tasty foods.

1838
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:28,619
(Your mouth waters just by looking at them.)

1839
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:29,919
This is...

1840
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,129
I roughly scanned them,

1841
01:00:32,759 --> 01:00:34,329
and the most expensive one was 15 dollars.

1842
01:00:34,729 --> 01:00:36,599
Most of them cost ten dollars.

1843
01:00:36,729 --> 01:00:38,329
I have to take pictures 150 times.

1844
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:39,928
(He has to take pictures with at least 100 people.)

1845
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:42,239
- With 150 people.
- With 150 people?

1846

Hello. Please come if you want to take a photo with me!

1882
01:01:48,769 --> 01:01:51,338
- 2 Days 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

1883
01:01:51,339 --> 01:01:53,239
(He shouted 2 Days 1 Night 15,464 times.)

1884
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:57,409
(He made babies cry 28,469 times.)

1885
01:01:57,709 --> 01:01:58,779
I love you.

1886
01:01:59,609 --> 01:02:01,979
(He was loved by the seniors 896,549 times.)

1887
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:07,619
(Current allowance: 16.1 dollars with 161 people)

1888
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:11,059
Let's take a photo.

1889
01:02:11,129 --> 01:02:12,729
Shall we take a photo?

1890
01:02:12,859 --> 01:02:14,929
- Count them in.
- Come in.

1891
01:02:16,059 --> 01:02:18,769
(The dumb brother is interacting with his fans.)

1892
01:02:20,999 --> 01:02:22,538
- Hotteok?
- There's hotteok.

1893
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:24,198
- How much is this?
- It's two dollars.

1894
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:25,539
- Two dollars?
- Yes.

1895
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:27,538
- Two dollars.
- Let's take a photo.

1896
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:29,838
We'll take a photo.

1897
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:31,649
(He takes a photo and earns money for the hotteok.)

1898
01:02:31,709 --> 01:02:34,649
- 2 Days 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

1899
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:36,518
Here you go. Two dollars.

1900
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,588
- No.
- No. I'll pay you today.

1901
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:40,489
- Thank you.
- I'll enjoy this.

1902
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,319
Look over here.

1903
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:44,959
(Please look over here, Jong Min.)

1904
01:02:45,859 --> 01:02:48,658
(He's a walking photo zone.)

1905
01:02:48,659 --> 01:02:49,659
Look at that.

1906
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,198
(Current allowance: 16 dollars)

1907
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:53,169
Let's go and eat.

1908
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:55,898
How many people?

1909
01:02:55,899 --> 01:02:57,369
(Why was Jong Min left behind?)

1910
01:02:59,169 --> 01:03:03,809
(We'll reveal the identity of the helper only to the viewers.)

1911
01:03:04,879 --> 01:03:05,879
(At the restaurant, only Joon is given the Hungry hint.)

1912
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,478
Joon will listen to the hint while the food is being prepared.

1913
01:03:08,479 --> 01:03:09,719
Okay!

1914
01:03:10,149 --> 01:03:11,648
- Joon.
- Share it with us right away.

1915
01:03:11,649 --> 01:03:13,048
I'll share it.

1916
01:03:13,049 --> 01:03:14,218
You're 100 percent going to lie.

1917
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:16,789
No. Why do you all think of me as such a person?

1918
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:20,359
(He moves to get a hint.)

1919
01:03:23,059 --> 01:03:25,029
(He smiles.)

1920
01:03:28,269 --> 01:03:30,299
How does it turn out like this?

1921
01:03:30,969 --> 01:03:32,169
How does it turn out like this?

1922
01:03:32,609 --> 01:03:34,709
It's a relief. I did my best.

1923
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,409
It's a relief.

1924
01:03:38,209 --> 01:03:40,078
- Now...
- Give me the hint.

1925
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:41,318
I'll give you the hint.

1926
01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:42,849
(Could it be?)

1927
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:46,849
(1 hour ago, Citron Village)

1928
01:03:47,859 --> 01:03:50,519
(The individual interviews end.)

1929
01:03:50,689 --> 01:03:54,429
(One person heads to a remote place alone.)

1930
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,668
You have been chosen by the Hungry Lupin...

1931
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,239
to be his helper.

1932
01:04:01,739 --> 01:04:04,269
(Helper?)

1933
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:07,069
(While choosing the card)

1934
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:10,979
What is this?

1935
01:04:11,309 --> 01:04:12,679
What is this?

1936
01:04:12,879 --> 01:04:16,149
You chose an empty card.

1937
01:04:16,579 --> 01:04:18,788
Why was I chosen?

1938
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:20,789
(Joon was chosen as the helper.)

1939
01:04:21,259 --> 01:04:23,659
Why was I chosen? I'm not good at such things.

1940
01:04:23,689 --> 01:04:26,188
You can only have dinner...

1941
01:04:26,189 --> 01:04:27,859
if Hungry Lupin isn't caught in the final selection.

1942
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:30,228
If Hungry Lupin gets caught, you won't have dinner.

1943
01:04:30,229 --> 01:04:31,398
Hungry Lupin.

1944
01:04:31,399 --> 01:04:33,228
I'll tell you who Hungry Lupin is.

1945
01:04:33,229 --> 01:04:34,699
Hungry Lupin is...

1946
01:04:42,739 --> 01:04:45,478
Hungry Lupin chose Lee Joon as his helper.

1947
01:04:45,479 --> 01:04:46,908
(Helper)

1948
01:04:46,909 --> 01:04:49,649
Hungry Lupin and his helper know of each other,

1949
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:52,119
and they can share information or updates.

1950
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,659
The helper can earn his dinner...

1951
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,989
only if Hungry Lupin doesn't get caught.

1952
01:04:59,989 --> 01:05:02,158
As the helper,

1953
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:03,628
you get one benefit.

1954
01:05:03,629 --> 01:05:04,798
As the helper, you'll have the authority...

1955
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:08,239
to eliminate one member, excluding yourself.

1956
01:05:08,539 --> 01:05:10,138
- The next location...
- Hold on.

1957
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,068
My heart is racing. I'm bad at these things.

1958
01:05:12,069 --> 01:05:13,139
Hold on.

1959
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:15,938
The helper has a special benefit...

1960
01:05:15,939 --> 01:05:18,048
even Hungry Lupin doesn't know of.

1961
01:05:18,049 --> 01:05:19,208
(Benefit)

1962
01:05:19,209 --> 01:05:21,948
The helper can eliminate...

1963
01:05:21,949 --> 01:05:23,519
one member who is the most threatening.

1964
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,089
It's a privilege that will let you take the game in your favor.

1965
01:05:28,259 --> 01:05:31,159
What sign will you use to decide the person to eliminate?

1966
01:05:31,529 --> 01:05:33,789
I'll do this. If I'm standing in the middle...

1967
01:05:34,029 --> 01:05:36,929
and I do this, it's the person standing on my left.

1968
01:05:37,529 --> 01:05:39,629
If I do this, it's the second person on my left.

1969
01:05:40,669 --> 01:05:43,239
(They arrived at the restaurant.)

1970
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,669
(The helper has to eliminate someone.)

1971
01:05:45,869 --> 01:05:48,439
(The members don't know about the helper.)

1972
01:05:49,539 --> 01:05:51,479
(During the mission, he looks around.)

1973
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:54,519
(While everyone is focusing on the food pictures...)

1974
01:05:55,379 --> 01:05:56,549
(He leans back and points.)

1975
01:05:57,849 --> 01:05:58,989
(He points once.)

1976
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:01,159
(He chose Kim Jong Min who is sitting next to him.)

1977
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:03,819
(The siren rings.)

1978
01:06:04,729 --> 01:06:06,159
- What is it?
- Is it me?

1979
01:06:06,289 --> 01:06:07,958
- What is going on?
- What is it?

1980
01:06:07,959 --> 01:06:09,529
- What is it?
- Why?

1981
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,928
(They're all confused.)

1982
01:06:11,929 --> 01:06:13,329
- What's going on?
- What?

1983
01:06:13,399 --> 01:06:14,768
(He is excited all by himself.)

1984
01:06:14,769 --> 01:06:16,269
Did he get dragged because he answered the question?

1985
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:18,038
(Without anyone knowing, )

1986
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:19,869
(he succeeds in leaving one member out.)

1987
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:24,308
(As the helper, he even won the game and got the hint.)

1988
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:26,779
It's a relief.

1989
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,378
- Now...
- Give me the hint.

1990
01:06:29,379 --> 01:06:30,879
I'll give you the hint.

1991
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:34,718
This is a video of a five-year-old drawing the Hungry Lupin...

1992
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:36,559
after looking at his picture.

1993
01:06:37,389 --> 01:06:39,289
Listen carefully and play it.

1994
01:06:39,489 --> 01:06:40,489
Okay.

1995
01:06:41,089 --> 01:06:44,159
I'm looking at the picture now.

1996
01:06:44,299 --> 01:06:46,269
The eyes look funny.

1997
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,799
His nose...

1998
01:06:48,339 --> 01:06:50,639
is triangular.

1999
01:06:50,939 --> 01:06:53,068
His lips are funny.

2000
01:06:53,069 --> 01:06:54,779
He looked like a bear.

2001
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:57,438
(Hungry Lupin seen through a child's innocent perspective)

2002
01:06:57,439 --> 01:06:59,549
This is amazing.

2003
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,479
They'll never know.

2004
01:07:02,449 --> 01:07:03,479
Goodness.

2005
01:07:03,879 --> 01:07:06,989
(He looked like a bear.)

2006
01:07:10,759 --> 01:07:11,828
He's coming.

2007
01:07:11,829 --> 01:07:13,128
(Only Hungry Lupin knows that Lee Joon is his helper.)

2008
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:14,289
Share it with us.

2009
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:16,599
- You should share.
- It's really difficult.

2010
01:07:16,759 --> 01:07:18,328
- Is it?
- Let's figure it out together.

2011
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:21,539
I figured out who it is.

2012
01:07:21,899 --> 01:07:23,568
- What?
- Because of one word.

2013
01:07:23,569 --> 01:07:25,668
- Really?
- I watched a video.

2014
01:07:25,669 --> 01:07:27,068
- A video.
- I watched a video.

2015
01:07:27,069 --> 01:07:28,908
- Outside.
- I went out and watched a video.

2016
01:07:28,909 --> 01:07:30,038
He can share it, right?

2017
01:07:30,039 --> 01:07:31,878
- Video?
- He can share it.

2018
01:07:31,879 --> 01:07:33,178
Seriously...

2019
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:34,478
It wasn't Hungry Lupin.

2020
01:07:34,479 --> 01:07:36,019
- Guess the person.
- It's you.

2021
01:07:36,749 --> 01:07:37,818
(Se Yoon is pointed out.)

2022
01:07:37,819 --> 01:07:39,989
- That's accurate.
- It's you.

2023
01:07:40,049 --> 01:07:41,989
It's 100 percent you.

2024
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:43,889
A five-year-old child...

2025
01:07:44,659 --> 01:07:47,289
drew Hungry Lupin...

2026
01:07:47,659 --> 01:07:49,028
after seeing his picture.

2027
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:51,429
Then the child explains the drawing.

2028
01:07:51,569 --> 01:07:52,728
Don't get hurt.

2029
01:07:52,729 --> 01:07:54,199
The eyes look funny.

2030
01:07:54,669 --> 01:07:55,868
That's Sae Ho.

2031
01:07:55,869 --> 01:07:57,268
Keep going.

2032
01:07:57,269 --> 01:07:58,938
His nose is triangular.

2033
01:07:58,939 --> 01:08:00,768
- Triangular?
- They're triangular.

2034
01:08:00,769 --> 01:08:03,439
His lips are funny.

2035
01:08:03,509 --> 01:08:05,148
They all look funny.

2036
01:08:05,149 --> 01:08:07,309
- But...
- Is he fat?

2037
01:08:08,019 --> 01:08:09,348
(His nostrils are flaring.)

2038
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:10,919
- What is it?
- He looks like a bear.

2039
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:12,648
He looks like a bear.

2040
01:08:12,649 --> 01:08:14,689
He looks like a bear.

2041
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:17,489
(That's me.)

2042
01:08:18,129 --> 01:08:19,158
(Our bear)

2043
01:08:19,159 --> 01:08:21,598
Honestly, the front bits are useless.

2044
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:23,599
He did his best at the beginning.

2045
01:08:24,629 --> 01:08:26,198
Do I look like a bear?

2046
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:27,199
No.

2047
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,938
- Does he look like a bear?
- Hey, DinDin.

2048
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:30,299
- That was why.
- Definitely not.

2049
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,338
- I thought you fooled us.
- No.

2050
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:34,739
I swear. I spoke the exact truth.

2051
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:36,679
You bear!

2052
01:08:37,579 --> 01:08:38,808
(Cornered)

2053
01:08:38,809 --> 01:08:40,348
- Hold on.
- We got you.

2054
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:42,178
This is what I have in mind.

2055
01:08:42,179 --> 01:08:43,649
Will you listen to this?

2056
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:46,189
First, I really want to eat. Second,

2057
01:08:46,919 --> 01:08:49,018
- I thought trouble had come.
- Why?

2058
01:08:49,019 --> 01:08:50,158
Are you saying you're in trouble?

2059
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,358
No. In all honesty...

2060
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,788
Look at you!

2061
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:54,158
- We got you!
- Actually...

2062
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:55,629
We got you!

2063
01:08:56,259 --> 01:08:58,428
(True behavior of Se Yoon who feels flustered)

2064
01:08:58,429 --> 01:08:59,868
I feel completely wronged.

2065
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:01,298
I developed a heart of understanding.

2066
01:09:01,299 --> 01:09:03,199
A heart of understanding for those who were wrongly imprisoned.

2067
01:09:03,599 --> 01:09:05,968
"So this is how they could feel."

2068
01:09:05,969 --> 01:09:07,638
Why did the five-year-old say it was like a bear?

2069
01:09:07,639 --> 01:09:08,708
Listen carefully.

2070
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:11,038
I'll speak logically. Listen carefully, Seon Ho.

2071
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,509
- So the hint was crucial.
- It can't be eaten.

2072
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,479
You have to think wisely as a smart one.

2073
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:17,748
"Like a bear" was mentioned.

2074
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:19,419
What would the production crew think with that expression?

2075
01:09:19,619 --> 01:09:21,319
It's the perfect hint.

2076
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:23,518
- A hint can't be that obvious.
- You're right.

2077
01:09:23,519 --> 01:09:26,528
"Like a bear" is some sort of trap.

2078
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:27,688
It's to make everyone think it's me.

2079
01:09:27,689 --> 01:09:29,259
Who enjoyed that situation the most?

2080
01:09:30,029 --> 01:09:31,928
- It was him.
- What? Oh, come on.

2081
01:09:31,929 --> 01:09:33,268
"Bear? Yes!"

2082
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,739
(Acting just like him)

2083
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:36,268
- Hear me out.
- Hold on.

2084
01:09:36,269 --> 01:09:37,838
- You have to think wisely, DinDin.
- Hey.

2085
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,208
You'll be in big trouble. You won't be able to have dinner.

2086
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:42,209
- DinDin.
- He's making sense though.

2087
01:09:42,539 --> 01:09:44,778
I'll be really honest.

2088
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:46,309
I missed the timing to say this.

2089
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:48,678
The hint said that person looked funny.

2090
01:09:48,679 --> 01:09:50,179
Who is the one who looks funny?

2091
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:52,548
Hey, who is the one who looks funny?

2092
01:09:52,549 --> 01:09:53,588
I'll be honest.

2093
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:54,818
I do look funny.

2094
01:09:54,819 --> 01:09:56,818
No! You look funny and ugly.

2095
01:09:56,819 --> 01:09:58,628
Right. I look funny and ugly.

2096
01:09:58,629 --> 01:10:00,289
But I'm certainly not a bear.

2097
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:03,198
- See that? Isn't he overreacting?
- It's obvious.

2098
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,558
- Listen, DinDin.
- Gosh, Se Yoon!

2099
01:10:04,559 --> 01:10:06,898
- Early in the morning...
- Se Yoon is lying!

2100
01:10:06,899 --> 01:10:08,898
- I'm not sweating at all.
- Seon Ho.

2101
01:10:08,899 --> 01:10:10,869
Early in the morning, I said this.

2102
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:12,808
The Hungry Lupin is surely...

2103
01:10:12,809 --> 01:10:14,339
I'll show you my heart rate.

2104
01:10:14,739 --> 01:10:15,938
A bear was mentioned.

2105
01:10:15,939 --> 01:10:17,539
I thought it was...

2106
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:19,949
a really big hint.

2107
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,979
Who else could be thought of with that hint?

2108
01:10:23,149 --> 01:10:25,789
It was just like giving the answer away.

2109
01:10:25,919 --> 01:10:28,419
(Se Yoon struggles with Joon's strategy.)

2110
01:10:28,689 --> 01:10:32,129
(Se Yoon's identity gets revealed only to the viewers.)

2111
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:35,158
What?

2112
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:36,399
(The card Se Yoon picked)

2113
01:10:37,729 --> 01:10:38,968
It's a blank card.

2114
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:41,999
(Se Yoon is not Hungry Lupin.)

2115
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:44,869
You all know who it is.

2116
01:10:45,109 --> 01:10:46,709
Even through this interview,

2117
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,239
I feel dumbfounded.

2118
01:10:48,409 --> 01:10:50,039
We won't be able to eat at this rate.

2119
01:10:51,139 --> 01:10:53,149
(Joon is the helper.)

2120
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:56,679
(The Hungry Lupin is 1 of these 4 members.)

2121
01:10:56,779 --> 01:10:58,918
I'm going to make it clear. I'm going to eat a lot.

2122
01:10:58,919 --> 01:11:01,019
- Gosh.
- I'm going to have dinner as well.

2123
01:11:01,489 --> 01:11:03,259
- Right.
- Gosh!

2124
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:06,959
It's for us. They aren't allowed to eat.

2125
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:09,529
(The colors of the dishes make your mouth water.)

2126
01:11:09,859 --> 01:11:11,728
The mustard greens kimchi was made with our own ingredients.

2127
01:11:11,729 --> 01:11:13,568
- Really?
- This was picked from the sea.

2128
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:14,899
- The seaweed was picked?
- Yes.

2129
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:17,039
- These were all collected?
- Yes.

2130
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:18,568
They look different.

2131
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:19,739
(The side dishes all have the taste of Goheung.)

2132
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:21,639
(I did it.)

2133
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:23,878
The bowl for the stew is huge.

2134
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:25,579
- It's really big.
- Gosh. I really want to eat this.

2135
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:28,949
(Strong eels caught from the sea of Goheung)

2136
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:30,778
Gosh!

2137
01:11:30,779 --> 01:11:32,188
This is totally a restorative dish.

2138
01:11:32,189 --> 01:11:33,818
They will taste delicious as they were freshly caught...

2139
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:35,059
and sent in the morning.

2140
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:37,819
This is such a healthy dish.

2141
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:42,098
If you are willing to make someone not be able to eat,

2142
01:11:42,099 --> 01:11:44,199
you can't come to a good place like this.

2143
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:45,628
(Making a stubborn claim)

2144
01:11:45,629 --> 01:11:47,698
- What are you doing?
- It's coming.

2145
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:49,499
(DinDin's whining is completely ignored.)

2146
01:11:49,999 --> 01:11:53,439
(A special sauce is applied to the grilled eel.)

2147
01:11:54,269 --> 01:11:57,639
(Grilled eel)

2148
01:11:59,009 --> 01:12:02,849
(Sweet and sour seasoned raw tongue sole)

2149
01:12:03,249 --> 01:12:05,818
(A legendary sea meal of Goheung)

2150
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:07,219
- Thank you for the food.
- This is the best ever.

2151
01:12:07,419 --> 01:12:09,318
This is insane. I've never seen anything like this.

2152
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:12,189
- This is surely good for you.
- It's so good!

2153
01:12:12,659 --> 01:12:13,789
Eel.

2154
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:16,959
If Se Yoon is taking a picture, it means it's...

2155
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:19,029
It's because it's his last meal today.

2156
01:12:19,929 --> 01:12:21,298
He won't be able to eat if he gets caught as the Hungry Lupin.

2157
01:12:21,299 --> 01:12:24,138
I didn't think he was that much of a fool.

2158
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:25,169
What a disappointment.

2159
01:12:25,769 --> 01:12:27,139
- I'll start eating now.
- Gosh.

2160
01:12:30,039 --> 01:12:31,648
- The meat is just...
- How does the soup taste?

2161
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:33,549
The soup is so good.

2162
01:12:33,779 --> 01:12:34,848
It's so rich.

2163
01:12:34,849 --> 01:12:36,948
- Is it like yukgaejang?
- No.

2164
01:12:36,949 --> 01:12:38,179
How should I put it?

2165
01:12:38,789 --> 01:12:41,248
The sticky taste is amazing.

2166
01:12:41,249 --> 01:12:43,358
It tastes savory...

2167
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,928
as the eel's oil gets mixed into the soup.

2168
01:12:45,929 --> 01:12:48,558
It feels completely different...

2169
01:12:48,559 --> 01:12:49,828
from a regular fish stew.

2170
01:12:49,829 --> 01:12:52,368
It feels refreshing just like the moray eel soup.

2171
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:54,328
Right. It feels a bit like the moray eel soup.

2172
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:55,768
Gosh, that must be good.

2173
01:12:55,769 --> 01:12:58,099
- Also, the eel is so soft.
- Right.

2174
01:12:58,209 --> 01:13:00,869
Try some of the grilled eel and the seasoned raw tongue sole.

2175
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:04,239
Was it grilled with the sauce?

2176
01:13:04,379 --> 01:13:05,409
Gosh!

2177
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:07,248
(Unable to speak)

2178
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:08,279
It's amazing.

2179
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:12,519
(They enjoy the plump grilled eel.)

2180
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:14,049
Gosh.

2181
01:13:14,519 --> 01:13:16,518
- The sauce isn't overbalanced.
- Right.

2182
01:13:16,519 --> 01:13:18,729
The meat itself is really firm.

2183
01:13:19,189 --> 01:13:21,629
- Gosh, this is killing me.
- A wrap is to die for.

2184
01:13:21,859 --> 01:13:23,158
Gosh, this is great.

2185
01:13:23,159 --> 01:13:24,398
(Wrapping it with the pickled perilla leaf)

2186
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:26,399
I think this is one of the best lunches we've ever had.

2187
01:13:26,929 --> 01:13:28,028
Seriously.

2188
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:29,869
More than anything, I feel healthier by eating this.

2189
01:13:30,969 --> 01:13:34,309
(Having another piece with the mustard greens kimchi)

2190
01:13:35,709 --> 01:13:37,039
It tastes so clean.

2191
01:13:37,339 --> 01:13:39,478
- It's good for your body.
- I love kimchi.

2192
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:41,349
- I think the kimchi will be good.
- Look at its color.

2193
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:44,419
Is it aged kimchi?

2194
01:13:44,749 --> 01:13:46,388
- The seasoned raw tongue sole.
- Gosh!

2195
01:13:46,389 --> 01:13:48,018
Se Yoon loves that kind of kimchi.

2196
01:13:48,019 --> 01:13:50,159
- The very sour ones.
- Gosh, this is great!

2197
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:54,529
The mustard greens kimchi is really good as well.

2198
01:13:54,629 --> 01:13:57,659
(How does the seasoned raw tongue sole taste?)

2199
01:13:58,829 --> 01:14:01,428
There's no other way to describe the sauce...

2200
01:14:01,429 --> 01:14:02,838
and the tongue sole is so chewy.

2201
01:14:02,839 --> 01:14:05,738
It looks like the ones served with raw fish naengmyeon.

2202
01:14:05,739 --> 01:14:08,309
The ones served with naengmyeon have a tougher texture.

2203
01:14:08,809 --> 01:14:11,108
- It has a fascinating texture.
- It's really savory.

2204
01:14:11,109 --> 01:14:12,348
- Gosh.
- You can feel the small bones,

2205
01:14:12,349 --> 01:14:13,349
but they make it taste better.

2206
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:15,878
You can certainly feel them, but they don't get in the way.

2207
01:14:15,879 --> 01:14:17,949
- Like gizzard shads?
- They're easy to chew.

2208
01:14:18,249 --> 01:14:19,748
I didn't expect it to be like this.

2209
01:14:19,749 --> 01:14:21,688
The soup is so clear.

2210
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:23,359
What about me and Seon Ho?

2211
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:26,658
All right. Se Yoon mentioned this before.

2212
01:14:26,659 --> 01:14:29,859
He said the kimchi rights of the members should be protected.

2213
01:14:30,329 --> 01:14:31,768
I don't think people in the Joseon Dynasty...

2214
01:14:31,769 --> 01:14:32,769
would've eaten like this.

2215
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:36,098
This is the precious kimchi handmade by the owner here.

2216
01:14:36,099 --> 01:14:37,669
- Gosh.
- You can't get seconds.

2217
01:14:37,769 --> 01:14:39,568
Kimchi from the Jeolla Province is a separate dish.

2218
01:14:39,569 --> 01:14:40,868
I did want to try the kimchi.

2219
01:14:40,869 --> 01:14:42,039
It does look good.

2220
01:14:42,139 --> 01:14:43,379
(Sniffing)

2221
01:14:43,509 --> 01:14:44,938
- Gosh.
- The kimchi does smell amazing.

2222
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:48,719
This would be amazing as a kimchi stew.

2223
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:54,148
The mustard greens kimchi was handmade here.

2224
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:56,189
- It's amazing.
- Gosh, it's amazing.

2225
01:14:56,259 --> 01:14:58,019
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2226
01:14:58,729 --> 01:14:59,859
It's really good.

2227
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,258
The kimchi tastes really good.

2228
01:15:02,259 --> 01:15:03,359
I'll eat it with the eel.

2229
01:15:03,659 --> 01:15:05,129
We're eating it with the eel.

2230
01:15:05,269 --> 01:15:06,299
Gosh.

2231
01:15:07,099 --> 01:15:09,098
It's been a while for me to finish the whole bowl.

2232
01:15:09,099 --> 01:15:10,469
(Clean bowl)

2233
01:15:11,339 --> 01:15:13,169
It has the oil of the eel.

2234
01:15:13,309 --> 01:15:15,338
This is the first time I finished the whole bowl this year.

2235
01:15:15,339 --> 01:15:16,739
I never usually drink all of the soup like this.

2236
01:15:17,739 --> 01:15:18,778
It's the taste of Jeolla Province.

2237
01:15:18,779 --> 01:15:20,079
(Jeolla Province's food never disappoints.)

2238
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:23,349
By the way, is Jong Min being tortured somewhere?

2239
01:15:23,749 --> 01:15:25,149
- Right.
- Will we not see him?

2240
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:28,518
I feel lonely eating on my own.

2241
01:15:28,519 --> 01:15:30,589
(He's having a bite now after earning some pocket money.)

2242
01:15:31,259 --> 01:15:34,059
(Citron Jong Min's lunch)

2243
01:15:34,859 --> 01:15:36,158
(Yukjeon and rice)

2244
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:37,459
(The shrimp is a bonus.)

2245
01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:39,268
(Peeking)

2246
01:15:39,269 --> 01:15:40,799
- Does it taste good?
- Yes.

2247
01:15:42,569 --> 01:15:43,968
Is it the jeon?

2248
01:15:43,969 --> 01:15:45,409
(Don't be eyeing someone else's food, Jong Min.)

2249
01:15:45,569 --> 01:15:47,468
I have some yukjeon.

2250
01:15:47,469 --> 01:15:48,478
(He attempts to make a trade.)

2251
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:49,508
Should we trade?

2252
01:15:49,509 --> 01:15:52,079
I'll give you some of my shrimp.

2253
01:15:52,449 --> 01:15:54,109
- How does that sound?
- That sounds good.

2254
01:15:54,679 --> 01:15:56,749
- It's a trade.
- Isn't that too much?

2255
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:58,488
- Around this much?
- Yes.

2256
01:15:58,489 --> 01:16:00,448
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

2257
01:16:00,449 --> 01:16:01,519
(His meal has become a lot more abundant thanks to her.)

2258
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:03,789
I have to try different kinds of food.

2259
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:06,459
- Enjoy your meal. Thank you.
- Enjoy your meal.

2260
01:16:06,889 --> 01:16:08,798
It's the yukjeon made with the two-plus grade beef.

2261
01:16:08,799 --> 01:16:09,859
I'll make sure to enjoy it.

2262
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:11,629
(Eating)

2263
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,069
(It's delicious.)

2264
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:17,068
Gosh, I'm having pajeon with rice.

2265
01:16:17,069 --> 01:16:19,109
(This time it's a collaboration between pajeon and rice.)

2266
01:16:24,979 --> 01:16:28,919
(I don't know which punk sent me here, )

2267
01:16:30,549 --> 01:16:32,648
Gosh, I finished everything. My plate is clean.

2268
01:16:32,649 --> 01:16:33,689
(but I ate as much as I worked!)

2269
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,089
(Helper)

2270
01:16:36,119 --> 01:16:38,119
(Joon is the helper.)

2271
01:16:38,759 --> 01:16:40,259
(Citizen)

2272
01:16:40,289 --> 01:16:43,129
(Se Yoon is the citizen.)

2273
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:48,069
(The Hungry Lupin is still lying at this moment.)

2274
01:16:48,899 --> 01:16:49,968
(These two got on the car first.)

2275
01:16:49,969 --> 01:16:51,038
That was nice.

2276
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:52,539
(Putting his thumb up)

2277
01:16:52,669 --> 01:16:54,109
The hint was hilarious.

2278
01:16:54,369 --> 01:16:55,778
- I went exactly with it.
- Right.

2279
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:56,938
I didn't exaggerate one bit.

2280
01:16:56,939 --> 01:16:58,408
I know what you're like.

2281
01:16:58,409 --> 01:16:59,508
Just right now,

2282
01:16:59,509 --> 01:17:01,879
Se Yoon got all of the spotlight...

2283
01:17:02,279 --> 01:17:04,549
because of the bear hint.

2284
01:17:04,849 --> 01:17:07,648
I don't think there will be any issues for me...

2285
01:17:07,649 --> 01:17:09,059
at this rate.

2286
01:17:10,019 --> 01:17:14,159
(The two become quiet as Bear Se Yoon appears.)

2287
01:17:14,859 --> 01:17:17,058
(DinDin and Seon Ho get on as well.)

2288
01:17:17,059 --> 01:17:18,259
Let's set off!

2289
01:17:18,299 --> 01:17:20,369
(They head to the next spot.)

2290
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:24,239
(No one knows about the helper except for the Hungry Lupin.)

2291
01:17:24,299 --> 01:17:25,739
We're setting off without Jong Min.

2292
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:27,809
Where has Jong Min gone?

2293
01:17:28,469 --> 01:17:30,839
- He's been away for so long.
- When he left earlier,

2294
01:17:31,009 --> 01:17:33,479
it felt like he was just visiting the restroom.

2295
01:17:33,579 --> 01:17:35,219
I don't think he has even eaten.

2296
01:17:35,319 --> 01:17:36,979
Don't you know where he has gone?

2297
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:38,249
I do.

2298
01:17:38,419 --> 01:17:40,248
So he was sent away by someone?

2299
01:17:40,249 --> 01:17:42,288
- He was sent away.
- It wasn't because of a mistake.

2300
01:17:42,289 --> 01:17:44,318
- Definitely.
- He would never say anything wrong.

2301
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:47,128
I'm 100 percent certain the Hungry Lupin sent him away.

2302
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:48,628
The Hungry Lupin sent him away on purpose?

2303
01:17:48,629 --> 01:17:49,658
Right.

2304
01:17:49,659 --> 01:17:51,729
He just didn't like Jong Min in general.

2305
01:17:52,229 --> 01:17:54,498
Jong Min didn't really close down on someone...

2306
01:17:54,499 --> 01:17:57,838
with a certain deduction.

2307
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,938
This is a basic principle in the Mafia game.

2308
01:17:59,939 --> 01:18:01,979
The one who hasn't done much should be removed.

2309
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:04,338
- Really?
- That's how suspicion is avoided.

2310
01:18:04,339 --> 01:18:06,608
Let's see how Se Yoon carries on with the game.

2311
01:18:06,609 --> 01:18:08,819
We'll see how much he pretends not to be the Hungry Lupin.

2312
01:18:09,019 --> 01:18:11,378
I found this so cute. He kept rolling his fingers.

2313
01:18:11,379 --> 01:18:13,288
Right. He couldn't keep his hands still.

2314
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:14,318
(Anxious)

2315
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:15,358
No way.

2316
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:16,888
If you're not the Hungry Lupin,

2317
01:18:16,889 --> 01:18:18,758
you have to desperately say you're not.

2318
01:18:18,759 --> 01:18:20,628
- Desperately? Hold on.
- That means we're on the same team.

2319
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:23,628
Listen to this. I was pointed at by that poor hint.

2320
01:18:23,629 --> 01:18:25,998
Falling for that is a big shock to me.

2321
01:18:25,999 --> 01:18:27,599
You and DinDin.

2322
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,599
It's really baffling.

2323
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:34,069
They all look like fools.

2324
01:18:34,909 --> 01:18:36,609
Everything is going according to the plan.

2325
01:18:37,539 --> 01:18:40,979
Justice should be served. Then they will know.

2326
01:18:41,779 --> 01:18:44,819
But I feel strangely bad that they suspect me.

2327
01:18:45,549 --> 01:18:46,788
Se Yoon, just say what's on your mind.

2328
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:49,089
Who do you think it is?

2329
01:18:49,919 --> 01:18:52,328
I'll tell you who's not Hungry Lupin.

2330
01:18:52,329 --> 01:18:54,758
Yoo Seon Ho and DinDin.

2331
01:18:54,759 --> 01:18:57,298
These two suspect me, I don't think they're Hungry Lupin.

2332
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,699
I suspected you 80 percent.

2333
01:19:00,129 --> 01:19:02,268
- But it went down to 50 percent.
- I see.

2334
01:19:02,269 --> 01:19:03,468
(Happy)

2335
01:19:03,469 --> 01:19:07,569
Honestly, I don't trust anyone but Sae Ho.

2336
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:09,778
- You trust me, right?
- I'm sure it isn't Sae Ho.

2337
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:11,409
- You're right.
- Are you suspecting me?

2338
01:19:11,509 --> 01:19:13,508
I'm not 100 percent sure.

2339
01:19:13,509 --> 01:19:15,109
- Really?
- I'm 100 percent sure about Sae Ho.

2340
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:18,479
There's a possibility that it could be something shocking.

2341
01:19:18,749 --> 01:19:21,288
None of us is suspecting Jong Min.

2342
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:22,588
- Right?
- Exactly.

2343
01:19:22,589 --> 01:19:25,459
He sent himself on purpose?

2344
01:19:25,589 --> 01:19:26,688
I think that's possible.

2345
01:19:26,689 --> 01:19:29,358
- If he were Hungry Lupin...
- Himself?

2346
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:31,228
- Not to get caught?
- He can be really cunning.

2347
01:19:31,229 --> 01:19:33,029
He can use petty tricks.

2348
01:19:33,799 --> 01:19:40,909
(Jong Min was dragged away, not knowing what was going on.)

2349
01:19:41,939 --> 01:19:44,378
(It turns out it was Jong Min and Lee Joon's plan?)

2350
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:45,508
(I'm hungry.)

2351
01:19:45,509 --> 01:19:47,179
(It turns out it was Jong Min and Lee Joon's plan?)

2352
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:50,079
I think we will find out once we go and see him.

2353
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,419
For your information,

2354
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:56,189
once you get there, you will be doing the last mission.

2355
01:19:56,489 --> 01:19:59,988
It is your last chance to get a hint.

2356
01:19:59,989 --> 01:20:01,659
- Okay.
- It's really important.

2357
01:20:02,029 --> 01:20:04,428
- We have to try hard to do well...
- Oh, dear.

2358
01:20:04,429 --> 01:20:06,498
- so we can get a hint.
- We should do that.

2359
01:20:06,499 --> 01:20:08,028
We have to succeed and get a hint.

2360
01:20:08,029 --> 01:20:10,099
- Se Yoon, then...
- Yes.

2361
01:20:11,769 --> 01:20:15,138
(With the identity of Hungry Lupin left mysterious, )

2362
01:20:15,139 --> 01:20:18,509
(they are heading to the next spot.)

2363
01:20:18,749 --> 01:20:21,278
- We're in trouble. What's that?
- What?

2364
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:23,779
- Is that a mudflat?
- What's that?

2365
01:20:23,949 --> 01:20:26,018
- Are we going to a mudflat?
- Is there a mudflat?

2366
01:20:26,019 --> 01:20:29,088
- Now, we are...
- What are we doing?

2367
01:20:29,089 --> 01:20:30,519
(A wide mudflat)

2368
01:20:30,619 --> 01:20:33,159
We found out who Hungry Lupin is!

2369
01:20:33,289 --> 01:20:34,988
That's too much mud.

2370
01:20:34,989 --> 01:20:36,758
We've decided who it is.

2371
01:20:36,759 --> 01:20:38,799
The mudflat is so wide.

2372
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:41,629
Isn't this the South Sea?

2373
01:20:41,969 --> 01:20:43,498
Why is the mudflat so big?

2374
01:20:43,499 --> 01:20:45,668
This is too much mud.

2375
01:20:45,669 --> 01:20:46,738
Unbelievable.

2376
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:49,239
(This is all mudflats.)

2377
01:20:49,609 --> 01:20:52,409
What's that bridge? It's really long.

2378
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:54,108
Is it a rainbow bridge?

2379
01:20:54,109 --> 01:20:56,118
Did you wonder where Jong Min was taken to?

2380
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:57,279
Yes. Where is he?

2381
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:58,719
What?

2382
01:20:59,449 --> 01:21:01,188
- What?
- He's a parking attendant. What?

2383
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,259
What?

2384
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:03,918
(Citron Jong Min, the parking attendant)

2385
01:21:03,919 --> 01:21:05,259
- What?
- What is he doing?

2386
01:21:05,459 --> 01:21:07,288
- What is he wearing?
- He's a human citron.

2387
01:21:07,289 --> 01:21:09,299
- He's a citron.
- He's become a citron.

2388
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:12,268
(Hurry and get off.)

2389
01:21:12,269 --> 01:21:13,868
- What is this?
- What?

2390
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:14,998
- What are you doing, Mister?
- What?

2391
01:21:14,999 --> 01:21:16,299
What are you doing here?

2392
01:21:16,669 --> 01:21:19,168
I don't know. Did I do something wrong?

2393
01:21:19,169 --> 01:21:20,568
(He doesn't seem to know why he was taken here.)

2394
01:21:20,569 --> 01:21:23,009
Your face... The makeup...

2395
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:25,849
He was being exploited.

2396
01:21:26,279 --> 01:21:29,449
There's something you should know about Jong Min.

2397
01:21:29,749 --> 01:21:31,078
What did he do?

2398
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:33,548
He was taken out by the helper's choice.

2399
01:21:33,549 --> 01:21:35,718
- Helper?
- Helper? What does that mean?

2400
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:36,919
Who's the helper?

2401
01:21:37,589 --> 01:21:39,588
So, Hungry Lupin has a helper.

2402
01:21:39,589 --> 01:21:41,259
- I'm full now.
- Are you full?

2403
01:21:41,559 --> 01:21:44,759
(The existence of his assistant has become known to everyone.)

2404
01:21:45,099 --> 01:21:46,698
He's got a helper.

2405
01:21:46,699 --> 01:21:48,468
- But...
- So, two of us are lying.

2406
01:21:48,469 --> 01:21:50,038
Then, why did he pick me?

2407
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:51,669
Why Jong Min?

2408
01:21:51,799 --> 01:21:54,138
So, you were taken away because the helper said so.

2409
01:21:54,139 --> 01:21:55,338
I was just taken to another place...

2410
01:21:55,339 --> 01:21:57,179
and had to make money to eat.

2411
01:22:00,579 --> 01:22:03,319
(Sae Ho quietly steps back.)

2412
01:22:03,819 --> 01:22:05,549
Who do you think is the helper?

2413
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:08,549
What hint?

2414
01:22:09,059 --> 01:22:11,088
It's not me. Hang on.

2415
01:22:11,089 --> 01:22:12,959
- No. It's not me.
- Let me think.

2416
01:22:13,759 --> 01:22:16,329
Jong Min was taken out...

2417
01:22:16,629 --> 01:22:18,599
- by the helper's choice.
- He made the decision on his own?

2418
01:22:19,269 --> 01:22:20,568
We can't tell.

2419
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:22,938
So it's 4 against 2, not 5 against 1.

2420
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:24,939
- That's right.
- Two of us are lying now.

2421
01:22:25,069 --> 01:22:26,909
- So...
- The two people who are lying...

2422
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:29,079
- Stay quiet.
- Why?

2423
01:22:30,039 --> 01:22:31,608
(The moment he starts talking, he falls under suspicion.)

2424
01:22:31,609 --> 01:22:32,908
- It's not me.
- It's you.

2425
01:22:32,909 --> 01:22:34,108
- Did you send me away?
- Is it me?

2426
01:22:34,109 --> 01:22:36,148
- It's not me.
- You're the helper.

2427
01:22:36,149 --> 01:22:38,118
- He's right.
- Did you do that?

2428
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:39,448
Once I catch him, I won't let it slide.

2429
01:22:39,449 --> 01:22:41,719
- You are Hungry Lupin.
- Really?

2430
01:22:41,819 --> 01:22:44,558
And you tricked this innocent one into becoming your helper.

2431
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:45,788
- Me?
- Yes.

2432
01:22:45,789 --> 01:22:47,558
- Then, did Joon send Jong Min away?
- He did?

2433
01:22:47,559 --> 01:22:49,458
- Was it you?
- No, I'm not.

2434
01:22:49,459 --> 01:22:50,698
(Did you send me away?)

2435
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:52,928
- Is that true?
- I have no reason to do that.

2436
01:22:52,929 --> 01:22:55,269
- Why...
- Now that I think about it,

2437
01:22:55,639 --> 01:22:57,338
Joon was really bad at the games.

2438
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:59,309
I can tell just by looking at your eyes.

2439
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:01,568
(Madness)

2440
01:23:01,569 --> 01:23:03,908
You will be doing the mission here.

2441
01:23:03,909 --> 01:23:04,979
What is it?

2442
01:23:05,009 --> 01:23:07,509
You should get changed before the mission.

2443
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:09,079
Jong Min has already changed.

2444
01:23:09,749 --> 01:23:11,748
You will change into the clothes for this place...

2445
01:23:11,749 --> 01:23:13,148
and gather again.

2446
01:23:13,149 --> 01:23:15,048
I went through a lot of hardships.

2447
01:23:15,049 --> 01:23:16,318
(Hurry and change your clothes.)

2448
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:18,488
The weather is crazy today.

2449
01:23:18,489 --> 01:23:20,459
- It's hot.
- It's like summer.

2450
01:23:20,589 --> 01:23:22,598
Who on earth sent me away?

2451
01:23:22,599 --> 01:23:23,659
Who do you think it is?

2452
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:26,598
It's Se Yoon or DinDin.

2453
01:23:26,599 --> 01:23:27,799
Is that what you think?

2454
01:23:27,929 --> 01:23:30,139
We also talked about it on our way here.

2455
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:32,668
There was no reason to send Jong Min away.

2456
01:23:32,669 --> 01:23:34,168
- Exactly.
- He just wanted to send you.

2457
01:23:34,169 --> 01:23:35,638
- What's your identity?
- It's not me.

2458
01:23:35,639 --> 01:23:39,179
I know. He just sent me away for no reason.

2459
01:23:40,879 --> 01:23:45,019
(Happy)

2460
01:23:45,149 --> 01:23:47,048
Once we find out the helper,

2461
01:23:47,049 --> 01:23:48,488
you can say he hates you.

2462
01:23:48,489 --> 01:23:50,418
Exactly. So, I don't care...

2463
01:23:50,419 --> 01:23:52,629
who Hungry Lupin is. I'll just find the helper.

2464
01:23:52,989 --> 01:23:55,028
Good. You should try hard with that goal in mind.

2465
01:23:55,029 --> 01:23:56,928
Do you hate the helper more than Hungry Lupin?

2466
01:23:56,929 --> 01:23:58,758
(Proud)

2467
01:23:58,759 --> 01:24:01,198
- There are a lot of crabs here.
- Are there many crabs?

2468
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,398
- You are right.
- They're Japanese ghost crabs.

2469
01:24:03,399 --> 01:24:04,468
Right.

2470
01:24:04,469 --> 01:24:06,238
We can eat Japanese ghost crabs, right?

2471
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,768
- They are delicious.
- You can eat them.

2472
01:24:07,769 --> 01:24:09,978
- We can eat them, but...
- There are other crabs too.

2473
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:11,779
This is amazing. It's getting into its home.

2474
01:24:12,379 --> 01:24:14,709
It's interesting that they go into their homes.

2475
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:16,379
There's a mud hopper.

2476
01:24:17,179 --> 01:24:18,379
This is huge.

2477
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:19,888
It's pretty.

2478
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:21,589
(Udo Mudflat)

2479
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:23,088
The bridge seen next to you...

2480
01:24:23,089 --> 01:24:26,229
is the longest pedestrian overpass in the country,

2481
01:24:26,459 --> 01:24:29,629
which is connected to the beautiful island of Goheung, U Island.

2482
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:32,098
(But they will perform the mission on the ground.)

2483
01:24:32,099 --> 01:24:33,629
Your feet will be stuck.

2484
01:24:33,869 --> 01:24:35,528
You can't get your feet out.

2485
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,599
This is really long.

2486
01:24:37,899 --> 01:24:39,708
This place will be covered with water.

2487
01:24:39,709 --> 01:24:40,838
Right.

2488
01:24:40,839 --> 01:24:42,308
(The worst place to fool the members)

2489
01:24:42,309 --> 01:24:43,438
- Hello.
- Hello.

2490
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:44,479
Right.

2491
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:45,848
You're in a mudflat.

2492
01:24:45,849 --> 01:24:47,608
- Yes.
- It's been a while.

2493
01:24:47,609 --> 01:24:48,648
- It's been a while.
- Right.

2494
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:50,448
What shines...

2495
01:24:50,449 --> 01:24:53,248
as beautifully as Goheung's nature is...

2496
01:24:53,249 --> 01:24:54,949
your unity, right?

2497
01:24:55,589 --> 01:24:56,889
Is that so?

2498
01:24:56,989 --> 01:24:59,528
So, Hungry Lupin and the helper will do something...

2499
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:01,858
to fail the mission on purpose.

2500
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:03,229
Probably.

2501
01:25:03,429 --> 01:25:05,829
(Smiling)

2502
01:25:05,969 --> 01:25:07,568
All right. So,

2503
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,399
- this is the last mission.
- It's not me.

2504
01:25:09,899 --> 01:25:12,608
We will set up the cameras first and tell you about it.

2505
01:25:12,609 --> 01:25:14,139
- Okay.
- Okay.

2506
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:16,208
One, two, three.

2507
01:25:16,209 --> 01:25:17,509
(2 hours before Hungry Lupin's arrest)

2508
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:19,578
- This is driving me crazy.
- Why?

2509
01:25:19,579 --> 01:25:21,309
The existence of the helper gives me a headache.

2510
01:25:21,809 --> 01:25:23,618
I have no idea who the helper is.

2511
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:26,348
- It's not you, is it?
- I'm telling you it's not me.

2512
01:25:26,349 --> 01:25:28,789
- Now that we're at this...
- Why is everyone suspecting me?

2513
01:25:28,889 --> 01:25:30,318
To be honest,

2514
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:32,589
I have no idea who it is.

2515
01:25:32,829 --> 01:25:35,088
You know who we should kill first in the Mafia Game.

2516
01:25:35,089 --> 01:25:37,158
- Who?
- The one who talks the most.

2517
01:25:37,159 --> 01:25:39,529
- Exactly.
- We should kill 1 of the 2.

2518
01:25:39,669 --> 01:25:40,928
It's upsetting.

2519
01:25:40,929 --> 01:25:42,098
(The one who talks the most)

2520
01:25:42,099 --> 01:25:43,498
The helper is DinDin.

2521
01:25:43,499 --> 01:25:45,599
When we were eating citron earlier,

2522
01:25:45,969 --> 01:25:47,939
Sae Ho took a really long time.

2523
01:25:48,069 --> 01:25:49,808
- What?
- Sae Ho took a long time.

2524
01:25:49,809 --> 01:25:53,548
- Right.
- After that, Joon finished it.

2525
01:25:53,549 --> 01:25:54,708
- Yes.
- One of them is the helper.

2526
01:25:54,709 --> 01:25:57,178
They are Hungry Lupin and the helper.

2527
01:25:57,179 --> 01:26:00,088
It didn't make sense. Those two ruined the game.

2528
01:26:00,089 --> 01:26:01,119
- Right.
- Exactly.

2529
01:26:01,649 --> 01:26:03,419
Why are they sticking together?

2530
01:26:04,419 --> 01:26:08,358
(Sae Ho is talking to Joon, the helper?)

2531
01:26:08,359 --> 01:26:09,599
They're alone.

2532
01:26:10,129 --> 01:26:11,399
(A rather suspicious scene)

2533
01:26:14,329 --> 01:26:15,999
- What?
- I get it.

2534
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:18,569
All of a sudden? Wait. You two should go over there.

2535
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:20,838
- All right. Say it.
- Okay.

2536
01:26:20,839 --> 01:26:23,138
- I get it now. Okay.
- Go ahead.

2537
01:26:23,139 --> 01:26:24,139
Is your brain working?

2538
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:26,909
Hungry Lupin didn't know Jong Min was sent away.

2539
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:28,608
The helper sent him.

2540
01:26:28,609 --> 01:26:29,918
- Right.
- That's true.

2541
01:26:29,919 --> 01:26:31,778
The helper knew that.

2542
01:26:31,779 --> 01:26:33,388
And Hungry Lupin was like, "What's going on?"

2543
01:26:33,389 --> 01:26:35,318
"I didn't do that. Why is he dragged out?"

2544
01:26:35,319 --> 01:26:36,559
- Exactly.
- Right.

2545
01:26:36,989 --> 01:26:38,618
- Joon is the helper.
- Why?

2546
01:26:38,619 --> 01:26:40,788
He sent Jong Min away. So he laughed a lot.

2547
01:26:40,789 --> 01:26:42,428
- Right.
- But Sae Ho was like,

2548
01:26:42,429 --> 01:26:44,258
"What? I didn't do anything."

2549
01:26:44,259 --> 01:26:45,558
"Why is he leaving?"

2550
01:26:45,559 --> 01:26:47,869
- He was as surprised as we were.
- Right.

2551
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:49,938
So Sae Ho is Hungry Lupin, and Joon is the helper.

2552
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:51,238
- What?
- Is that right?

2553
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:52,338
- Am I Hungry Lupin?
- Right?

2554
01:26:52,339 --> 01:26:53,769
- Don't be ridiculous.
- And Joon is the helper.

2555
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:54,969
You're the helper.

2556
01:26:55,309 --> 01:26:57,478
No! It's not me.

2557
01:26:57,479 --> 01:26:59,038
That's just what he says.

2558
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:00,578
Why are you suspecting someone innocent?

2559
01:27:00,579 --> 01:27:02,578
The thing is, I thought one person...

2560
01:27:02,579 --> 01:27:04,418
- Gather around, guys.
- I was right.

2561
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:06,689
- I was right.
- I'm telling you that's not it.

2562
01:27:06,949 --> 01:27:08,989
- I was right.
- I'm telling you that's not it.

2563
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:10,859
Why are you suspecting me all of a sudden?

2564
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:11,959
(Groaning)

2565
01:27:12,459 --> 01:27:14,388
(Their feet sink in.)

2566
01:27:14,389 --> 01:27:16,699
Your feet don't sink in much there. Please stand there.

2567
01:27:17,129 --> 01:27:18,429
This is too muddy.

2568
01:27:18,959 --> 01:27:20,829
- This is bad.
- Help me.

2569
01:27:21,029 --> 01:27:22,569
This is...

2570
01:27:22,739 --> 01:27:25,139
- That doesn't matter.
- Look. They're sticking together.

2571
01:27:25,569 --> 01:27:27,068
You're mistaken.

2572
01:27:27,069 --> 01:27:29,178
If you keep being like this, we will have to suspect you.

2573
01:27:29,179 --> 01:27:30,379
All the pieces are falling into place.

2574
01:27:30,439 --> 01:27:33,278
You're getting it wrong. What are you talking about?

2575
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:35,109
- What is he doing?
- Hang on.

2576
01:27:35,379 --> 01:27:37,148
- This is really...
- Stay there.

2577
01:27:37,149 --> 01:27:38,818
- No.
- All right.

2578
01:27:38,819 --> 01:27:40,789
Seon Ho, listen carefully from where you are now.

2579
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:43,358
- It's so sticky.
- Here's the last mission.

2580
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:45,319
It's Mudflat Impossible.

2581
01:27:46,789 --> 01:27:49,829
(Obstacles on the mudflats)

2582
01:27:50,129 --> 01:27:52,328
Five members will make a path...

2583
01:27:52,329 --> 01:27:53,999
by lying face down to make stepping stones.

2584
01:27:54,069 --> 01:27:56,468
If one member goes through all the obstacles,

2585
01:27:56,469 --> 01:27:58,338
passes the halfway point,

2586
01:27:58,339 --> 01:28:00,808
and grabs the flag without touching the mudflat,

2587
01:28:00,809 --> 01:28:02,678
the mission is complete.

2588
01:28:02,679 --> 01:28:03,879
(They succeed if the person on the bridge pulls out the flag.)

2589
01:28:03,939 --> 01:28:06,279
To go through the first obstacle,

2590
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:08,779
you should zigzag through the three poles.

2591
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:12,248
Then you should pass the halfway point.

2592
01:28:12,249 --> 01:28:13,549
(Section 2: Halfway point)

2593
01:28:13,649 --> 01:28:14,988
Do you see the hurdle there?

2594
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:17,518
The person on the bridge should go over the hurdle.

2595
01:28:17,519 --> 01:28:19,988
Once you come back and pull out the flag, it's done.

2596
01:28:19,989 --> 01:28:21,589
- Jump over the hurdle?
- Yes.

2597
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,428
- Okay. But...
- All right.

2598
01:28:23,429 --> 01:28:25,098
If you succeed in this mission,

2599
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:26,798
I will give you a crucial hint.

2600
01:28:26,799 --> 01:28:28,128
You'll receive a crucial hint.

2601
01:28:28,129 --> 01:28:29,269
(They must succeed for a crucial hint.)

2602
01:28:29,539 --> 01:28:30,998
This person's a bit...

2603
01:28:30,999 --> 01:28:32,139
(Helper Joon must sabotage them.)

2604
01:28:32,369 --> 01:28:34,768
We must separate Joon and Sae Ho.

2605
01:28:34,769 --> 01:28:36,278
- Yes.
- That way, look.

2606
01:28:36,279 --> 01:28:37,608
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min...

2607
01:28:37,609 --> 01:28:39,648
- Jong Min, Sae Ho, - No.

2608
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:41,148
- Se Yoon...
- Let's find Hungry Lupin later...

2609
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,208
and win first.

2610
01:28:42,209 --> 01:28:44,118
- Yes.
- Let's strategize first.

2611
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:46,388
I want DinDin to walk on the bridge.

2612
01:28:46,389 --> 01:28:47,418
Okay, I agree.

2613
01:28:47,419 --> 01:28:49,689
If we all do well and he somehow...

2614
01:28:50,119 --> 01:28:51,518
loses his balance on top...

2615
01:28:51,519 --> 01:28:53,329
- Then I'm guilty.
- Yes.

2616
01:28:53,389 --> 01:28:54,628
Then I'm the Hungry Lupin.

2617
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:56,429
- Let's make a sturdy bridge.
- Okay.

2618
01:28:56,659 --> 01:28:58,028
What's wrong, guys? The citron...

2619
01:28:58,029 --> 01:28:59,468
I really tried to eat it.

2620
01:28:59,469 --> 01:29:02,169
He could've sacrificed himself even when he was Hungry Lupin.

2621
01:29:02,299 --> 01:29:05,068
Jong Min would never leave knowing he could eat eel.

2622
01:29:05,069 --> 01:29:06,438
That one mouthful...

2623
01:29:06,439 --> 01:29:09,039
I was guaranteed to eat one mouthful, okay?

2624
01:29:09,379 --> 01:29:12,038
- Yes.
- I could've had citron tea too.

2625
01:29:12,039 --> 01:29:13,649
(Sae Ho voices suspicion that Jong Min sent himself off.)

2626
01:29:13,909 --> 01:29:16,178
Can we play already? I'm as tall as Sae Ho now.

2627
01:29:16,179 --> 01:29:17,279
Let's play.

2628
01:29:17,779 --> 01:29:18,949
- Can we hurry?
- Let's do this.

2629
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:21,448
- Do you have a plan?
- Yes. Let's go.

2630
01:29:21,449 --> 01:29:23,589
It's a struggle just to stand still.

2631
01:29:24,019 --> 01:29:25,688
This will take a long time.

2632
01:29:25,689 --> 01:29:27,129
It's not easy. It'll be a while.

2633
01:29:27,189 --> 01:29:28,859
Number one has to rush ahead.

2634
01:29:29,029 --> 01:29:31,958
If possible, stick your head into the bottom...

2635
01:29:31,959 --> 01:29:33,098
of the person in front.

2636
01:29:33,099 --> 01:29:34,329
That won't be a pretty sight.

2637
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:36,498
I really don't like that.

2638
01:29:36,499 --> 01:29:37,538
(Punching)

2639
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:38,739
I hate that idea.

2640
01:29:39,139 --> 01:29:41,009
We'll start the mission!

2641
01:29:41,469 --> 01:29:44,379
Ready, get set...

2642
01:29:47,109 --> 01:29:48,308
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

2643
01:29:48,309 --> 01:29:49,719
Can you handle this much pressure?

2644
01:29:49,949 --> 01:29:51,648
That's fine. I can manage.

2645
01:29:51,649 --> 01:29:52,889
Is this okay?

2646
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:55,448
There's no way I'll fall off. Hang on.

2647
01:29:55,449 --> 01:29:56,689
I'm okay. Stay still.

2648
01:29:56,859 --> 01:29:58,518
Your mic's in the way. Just a minute.

2649
01:29:58,519 --> 01:29:59,928
I'm done. Okay.

2650
01:29:59,929 --> 01:30:01,028
I'm not okay.

2651
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:02,228
Am I okay?

2652
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:03,498
I'm still on top of you.

2653
01:30:03,499 --> 01:30:04,528
(Sae Ho goes ahead to extend the bridge.)

2654
01:30:04,529 --> 01:30:06,099
Wait. Hang on, Seon Ho.

2655
01:30:06,329 --> 01:30:08,769
(Acting annoyed for no reason)

2656
01:30:08,829 --> 01:30:10,698
No, wait. I'm not ready yet.

2657
01:30:10,699 --> 01:30:12,339
Stay closer to me. That's it.

2658
01:30:13,009 --> 01:30:14,408
- Gosh, you're big.
- This is...

2659
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:15,509
I can't...

2660
01:30:15,569 --> 01:30:16,638
(Massive excuse of a bottom)

2661
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:18,039
Look how big he is.

2662
01:30:18,739 --> 01:30:20,479
Joon, stay still.

2663
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:21,749
Go!

2664
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:22,749
(Screaming)

2665
01:30:23,079 --> 01:30:24,919
- Wait, stop.
- Don't overreact!

2666
01:30:24,979 --> 01:30:26,448
(You're too much.)

2667
01:30:26,449 --> 01:30:28,789
- Okay. Let's go.
- If we just keep doing this...

2668
01:30:28,919 --> 01:30:30,058
(The helper lets him go to stay safe.)

2669
01:30:30,059 --> 01:30:32,059
- Have you passed me?
- Wait. I'm still...

2670
01:30:32,089 --> 01:30:33,688
If we just keep doing this,

2671
01:30:33,689 --> 01:30:35,489
- there's no way we'll fail.
- Okay.

2672
01:30:35,689 --> 01:30:37,258
I'm just passing you.

2673
01:30:37,259 --> 01:30:39,399
- You're the sturdiest link.
- Okay, good.

2674
01:30:39,469 --> 01:30:42,028
- I'm fine.
- DinDin, where do I go?

2675
01:30:42,029 --> 01:30:44,269
- In front of Jong Min.
- To the front?

2676
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:46,609
Position yourself slightly diagonally.

2677
01:30:46,769 --> 01:30:49,879
(Hungry Lupin is quiet too.)

2678
01:30:50,179 --> 01:30:52,208
(Moving forward)

2679
01:30:52,209 --> 01:30:54,409
- Sae Ho, you're totally fine.
- I'm good.

2680
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:57,779
(Hungry Lupin candidate Sae Ho is doing well.)

2681
01:30:58,149 --> 01:30:59,448
I'm fine.

2682
01:30:59,449 --> 01:31:01,588
- Wait.
- Do I lower myself?

2683
01:31:01,589 --> 01:31:03,158
No, I'm not okay!

2684
01:31:03,159 --> 01:31:04,289
Stay still.

2685
01:31:04,389 --> 01:31:06,188
- We're totally okay.
- Are you done?

2686
01:31:06,189 --> 01:31:07,959
Wait. Keep still, Jong Min.

2687
01:31:08,059 --> 01:31:09,258
- Wait, Seon Ho.
- Okay.

2688
01:31:09,259 --> 01:31:11,899
(He passes safely, despite the ruckus.)

2689
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:14,569
(They could succeed at this rate.)

2690
01:31:14,829 --> 01:31:16,639
We're totally okay.

2691
01:31:16,999 --> 01:31:18,568
(Stalling)

2692
01:31:18,569 --> 01:31:20,908
Joon's weird. Joon's acting strangely.

2693
01:31:20,909 --> 01:31:22,708
- What's wrong with you?
- Joon's being weird.

2694
01:31:22,709 --> 01:31:24,208
Go fast. I'm sinking.

2695
01:31:24,209 --> 01:31:25,538
Don't step on my spine.

2696
01:31:25,539 --> 01:31:27,348
- Keep still.
- Yes, that's fine.

2697
01:31:27,349 --> 01:31:28,509
That will do.

2698
01:31:28,979 --> 01:31:33,689
I'm 98.98 percent sure that Joon is the helper.

2699
01:31:34,149 --> 01:31:36,759
Don't you dare let me catch you. How dare you send me away?

2700
01:31:38,189 --> 01:31:39,829
You're on the right spot.

2701
01:31:40,029 --> 01:31:41,128
Okay.

2702
01:31:41,129 --> 01:31:43,398
Where do I go from here? Tell me the way.

2703
01:31:43,399 --> 01:31:44,959
We have to go round the halfway point.

2704
01:31:45,429 --> 01:31:46,969
I hoped to shake him off.

2705
01:31:47,429 --> 01:31:48,829
He didn't fall.

2706
01:31:49,399 --> 01:31:50,898
We were on hands and knees,

2707
01:31:50,899 --> 01:31:53,939
so I'll try to topple him by pretending to hold onto him.

2708
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:56,178
(Hungry Lupin makes a move.)

2709
01:31:56,179 --> 01:31:57,539
Pretend it's a massage.

2710
01:31:58,009 --> 01:31:59,608
(Someone starts to act suspiciously.)

2711
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:00,848
Wait. Hang in there.

2712
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,048
You need to scoot back, Se Yoon.

2713
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:03,618
Seon Ho's back is too small.

2714
01:32:03,619 --> 01:32:05,319
Seon Ho's back is too small.

2715
01:32:05,549 --> 01:32:06,688
Are you okay?

2716
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:07,719
(Spitting)

2717
01:32:08,619 --> 01:32:10,959
(Swaying)

2718
01:32:11,059 --> 01:32:12,118
I'll keep going.

2719
01:32:12,119 --> 01:32:13,829
(Seon Ho suddenly acts out.)

2720
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:15,529
Hang on.

2721
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,358
(Turning the halfway point)

2722
01:32:17,359 --> 01:32:18,499
Okay, good.

2723
01:32:19,259 --> 01:32:21,999
(I'm dying over here.)

2724
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:25,568
- Hang on, Jong Min.
- Okay.

2725
01:32:25,569 --> 01:32:26,769
Aren't we guaranteed to...

2726
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:31,609
(Jong Min has been making an extra big fuss on this mission.)

2727
01:32:32,879 --> 01:32:33,949
Hey!

2728
01:32:34,779 --> 01:32:37,749
(A clenched fist?)

2729
01:32:37,779 --> 01:32:39,178
Go up to the front.

2730
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:40,788
(He leans on DinDin to stand up.)

2731
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:41,919
Wait. Keep still.

2732
01:32:42,149 --> 01:32:45,389
- It's so darn far.
- No, don't. I'm tired.

2733
01:32:45,419 --> 01:32:48,058
Go slow. Okay. Yes.

2734
01:32:48,059 --> 01:32:50,859
(Keeping a distance on purpose)

2735
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:53,869
- No, wait. Hang on.
- Okay.

2736
01:32:54,469 --> 01:32:55,498
(DinDin almost fell off.)

2737
01:32:55,499 --> 01:32:57,239
- Your clothes are muddy.
- Sorry.

2738
01:32:57,299 --> 01:33:00,139
(What a shame)

2739
01:33:00,269 --> 01:33:02,809
This means I'm at the hurdle.

2740
01:33:02,909 --> 01:33:04,108
Se Yoon has to be here.

2741
01:33:04,109 --> 01:33:05,708
Lie sideways.

2742
01:33:05,709 --> 01:33:06,709
Where?

2743
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:08,178
Will you please move?

2744
01:33:08,179 --> 01:33:09,409
(Please, move quickly.)

2745
01:33:09,749 --> 01:33:12,119
- I should lie sideways?
- Yes.

2746
01:33:13,219 --> 01:33:14,718
Joon, you lie sideways too.

2747
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:15,889
- Like this?
- Yes.

2748
01:33:16,089 --> 01:33:18,058
- I'm going forward.
- Shouldn't Se Yoon be here?

2749
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:19,928
- No, you're fine.
- Keep going.

2750
01:33:19,929 --> 01:33:20,958
(He climbs onto Sae Ho's back.)

2751
01:33:20,959 --> 01:33:22,059
This will work.

2752
01:33:22,429 --> 01:33:24,128
- My face is getting dirty.
- Sorry.

2753
01:33:24,129 --> 01:33:26,128
- Don't get mud on my face.
- Sorry. I won't.

2754
01:33:26,129 --> 01:33:27,529
(Sae Ho creates extra space.)

2755
01:33:27,599 --> 01:33:29,199
(Next episode)

2756
01:33:29,669 --> 01:33:30,698
Now, we will...

2757
01:33:30,699 --> 01:33:33,669
(Time left to arrest Hungry Lupin)

2758
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:36,639
(Time keeps passing.)

2759
01:33:36,879 --> 01:33:38,079
Don't trust him.

2760
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:42,879
(Emotions run high and cracks form.)

2761
01:33:43,449 --> 01:33:45,119
(Everyone seems suspicious.)

2762
01:33:46,019 --> 01:33:50,659
(Doubts increase.)

2763
01:33:51,419 --> 01:33:53,589
(Did the helper betray Hungry Lupin?)

2764
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:57,099
(Circumstances keep changing.)

2765
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:00,169
(Don't let your guard down until the very end.)

2766
01:34:00,999 --> 01:34:05,039
(Who's the real Hungry Lupin?)

2767
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:07,709
Gosh. He's not in his right mind.

2768
01:34:08,139 --> 01:34:09,268
He's insane.

2769
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:10,409
(See you next week.)
