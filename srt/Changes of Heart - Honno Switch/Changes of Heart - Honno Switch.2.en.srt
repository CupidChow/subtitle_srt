Hijiri, sorry to keep you waiting.

Sorry, I'm late.

Koyori, you're wearing... a skirt?

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,360
I wore skirts for school, remember?

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,810
That was your uniform, this is different.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,830
You look really pretty.

Why can't I look him in the eye?

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:51,880
Hijiri and I are childhood friends who grew up together. However...

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,290
I've turned it off.

00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,160
- Hijiri?
- Don't you remember what happened yesterday?

Will you go out with me?

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,340
And so, we've decided to date each other.

- Let's not go to a cat cafe.
- Why?

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,020
I figured we should go somewhere new for our first date.

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,810

00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,350

Good. Let's go then.

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,090
Sorry! I was a little startled.

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,350
It's not that I don't like holding your hand.

It's refreshing to see you blush.

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,710
That makes me all the more certain that I love you.

Huh?

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,380
Back then, you had a boyfriend.

36
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,030
So you acted completely unfazed, even when I got close.

37
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:24,480
But now, you're here next to me, your face as red as a tomato.

We'll have lots of time to spend with each other.

42

Who knew he'd gotten so mature?

45
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,380

- Yeah. Maybe.

52
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,400
The aquarium sure was fun.

53
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,970
You've got cream on your face.

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,050

- She's older than you?
- Yeah, older.

00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,450
That was close! I hope she didn't catch me watching them.

Saito, what are you doing here?

151
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,210
I think I'm a little drunk.

152
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,970
In that case, maybe a little fresh air outside will do you good.

153
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:54,190
But I'm scared of going out there alone, so if you'll accompany me...

What?

156
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,160
She seemed unfazed when I was sitting beside you.

157
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,840
She even averted her gaze when you were concerned.

158
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,760
That doesn't look like love to me.

159
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,150
- Maybe I should stick closer to you.
- Huh?

160
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,500
If we can get Hoshi to feel jealous, it'll prove that she loves you.

161
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,830
What are we trying to achieve by doing that?

162
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,680
You'll be able to know how much she loves you, no?

163
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,770
I'll know how much she loves me, and then what?

164
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,960
Won't you feel assured then?

165
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,330
Testing someone's love just to make oneself feel assured...

166
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,390
The one who's testing this love is precisely the one who lacks it.

167
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,190
I'll be fine. No need to worry about me.

168
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,740

169
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,340

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,060
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

171
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,280
Koyori, you don't really drink outside. What's wrong?

172
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,710
- I got too excited, so...
- Liar.

173
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,850
I'm not lying. I had a blast, really.

174
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,060

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,120
- Nah, I'm good.
- Aw, don't be such a killjoy.

178
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,380
- What? You're putting your girl over our friendship now?
- Stop teasing.

179
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,620
- Join them. You guys don't meet often.
- Huh?

180
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,610
I'm feeling better already.

181
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,710
- I'll get going. Bye.
- See you.

182
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,650
Where shall we go?

183
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,010
Koyori.

184
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,060
- Let's go.
- One more round of drinks!

185
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,490
Hey.

186
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,900
Sorry for suddenly dropping by.

187
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,330
I'll make myself at home.

188
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,900
I'm enjoying the green curry that I cooked.

189
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,640
Green curry, again?

190
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,960
How was the class reunion?

191
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,640
Was your first love there as well?

192
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,580
He was, but he was sticking to his childhood buddy. So boring.

193
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,060
Say what?

194
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,600
Is dating your childhood friend the rave nowadays?

195
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
Why ask such a question?

196
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,560
Well...

197
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,530
I hope we can start over.

198
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,350
Request denied.

199
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,950
My ex has also started going out with her childhood friend.

200
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,940
Speaking of, what kind of girl is your ex?

201
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,820
I want to see what she looks like.

202
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,890
Let me see.

203
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,670
Give it back.

204
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,120
Say, Sosuke...

205
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,020
Do you want to get back together with your ex?

206
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,450
- Delicious, right?
- Yeah.

207
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,870
Want to try some of mine?

208
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,460
Koyori?

209
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,150
What's on your mind?

210
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,040
Oh, nothing in particular.

211
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,730
[Sosuke Yoshida]

212
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,030
What should I do?

213
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,320
I hope we can start over.

214
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,050
I don't want Hijiri to worry too much about this.

215
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,400
You're not answering it?

216
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,760
It was just spam. I've been getting lots of those recently.

217
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,860
Is that so?

218
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,520
- After this...
- Yeah?

219
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,430
- How about coming over to my place?
- Huh?

220
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,620
Thanks for having me.

221
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,690
- Tea?
- Sure.

222
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,860
- Just make yourself at home.
- Okay.

223
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,850
Koyori.

224
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,870
Sorry, you startled me.

225
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,680
I've been feeling uneasy.

226
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,690
You were lost in thought all day today.

227
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,670
Koyori?

228
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,550
If there's something bugging you, tell me.

229
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:53,750
Where did you and Saito go during the class gathering?

230
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,180
It looked like both of you had left your seats,

231
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,490
so I was just wondering.

232
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,240
- I wasー
- Not that I don't trust you.

233
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,010
It's just that seeing you two together reminded me of your relationship.

234
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,820
Sorry, Koyori.

235
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,380
- I can't go home with you today.
- Huh?

236
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,820
See ya.

237
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:29,800
So I drank to distract myself from overthinking things, and ended up having a drop too much.

238
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:36,660
Sorry. I never meant for you to see my unpleasant feelings.

239
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,800
It's perfectly fine to show them to me.

240
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:53,910
I don't want you to end up hating me for not realizing you were bottling things up.

241
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,770
There's nothing between me and Saito.

242
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,000
Got it.

243
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,850
Sorry. I lied to you earlier.

244
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,170
What?

245
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,250
That call was from Yoshida.

246
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,190
He wants to get back together with you?

247
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,830
I highly doubt that's why he called.

248
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,310
Koyori, thank you for telling me.

249
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,020
Hijiri...

250
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,540
Will you be okay?

251
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,970
It must be uncomfortable for you, since you're coworkers.

252
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,970
Totally not. Don't worry, I'm not bothered at all.

253
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,060
Really?

254
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,060
- It's thanks to you, Hijiri.
- What?

255
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,130
I was really depressed when I was dumped.

256
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,750
But in a night, you became the only person on my mind.

257
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,460
And all the unhappiness that I felt before had vanished.

258
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:21,650
Let me say this now. I love you, Hijiri.

259
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,020
And it's because I love you...

260
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:37,640
That I've become too aware of my feelings for you.

261
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,160
I'm sorry that I struggle to be honest.

262
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,600
I know.

263
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,690
I know why you avert your gaze.

264
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,170
No matter what others say, I alone will know.

265
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,930
And that's enough for me.

266
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,360
Hijiri...

267
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,010
Can you repeat what you just said?

268
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,450
I love you, Hijiri.

269
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,900
Okay, I looked into your eyes and said it.

270
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,980
- Ten more seconds.
- What?

271
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,840
- That wasn't long enough.
- Wait, the water is boiling.

272
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,700
- I'd better switch it off quickly.
- It's going to catch fire.

273
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,240
- The sky is already dark.
- Right? That was quick.

274
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,460
I can do it this time.

275
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,390
Here goes!

276
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,840
What are you doing?

277
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,800
Jeez...

278
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,700
- You noticed?
- I did.

279
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,770
We're here.

280
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,560
Thanks for inviting me over today.

281
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,230
- You could have stayed the night.
- Huh?

282
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,930
Just kidding.

283
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,460
Oh, you caught me off guard.

284
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,310
We'll go at your pace. Okay?

285
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,830
Okay.

286
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,270
- For you.
- What?

287
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:37,200
The key to my house. Just come over whenever you feel like it.

288
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,450
- Not whenever I feel like it.
- Huh?

289
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,790
Sometimes we need our alone time after a long day of work.

290
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,840
I'll make sure to let you know if I want to come over.

291
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,650
Don't worry about saying no to me.

292
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,980
Got it.

293
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,920
But if I want to go over no matter what, I'll tell you so. All right?

294
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,290
Sure.

295
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,030
♫ A casual moment makes me wonder ♫

296
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,700
♫ A casual moment makes me wonder ♫

297
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,330
♫ But one thing is for sure ♫

298
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,250
♫ Do you wanna be my lady? ♫

299
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,620
I really am Hijiri's girlfriend now.

300
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,020
♫ Baby, say "I do" ♫

301
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,500
Stop glaring at me, Koyori.

302
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,940
Don't call me by my first name.

303
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,400
And contact me via our team's group chat. Now, if you'll excuse me.

304
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,210
The sales rep from Tint Games wants to meet with you.

305
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,200
You mean the company that develops romance games?

306
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,800
We might be in charge of developing an app for Tint,

307
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,850
and their sales rep is apparently a fan of the games you plan.

308
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,290
They wanted to meet you over dinner.

309
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,880
You should have told me earlier that this was about work.

310
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,300
I got it.

311
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,160
Keep your schedule free for this Friday.

312
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,840
Sure thing.

313
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,370
That went well.

314
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:32,700
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
🎀The bonds of love 💞 Team@Viki.com

315
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,710
Good evening. Did you make a reservation?

316
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,270
Yes, under the name "Yoshida".

317
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,620
Welcome, Mr. Yoshida. This way, please.

318
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,420
Koyori?

319
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,600
What?

320
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,730
Koyori, what are you waiting for? Hurry up andー

321
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,090
Hijiri, sorry to keep you waiting.

322
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,010
Saito?

323
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,780
Hoshi?

324
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,990
What the heck is going on?
