Well, yeah... That's what I've been trying to achieve.

175
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,770
I knew it! I'm right, aren't I?

176
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,880
Sorry about what I said earlier.

177
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,040
Nah, don't worry about that.

178
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,450
Same to you too, Ms. Hoshi.

179
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,020
No, likewise, I'm at fault.

180
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,210
All right, let's grind, shall we?

181
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,020
Okay...

182
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,040
Koyori, welcome back.

183
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,250
What's wrong?

184
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,970
Did something happen at work?

185
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,960
I see. I've gotten that sort of envy too, about going home early.

186
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,960
But I've finished my work. Of course, I'll leave.

187
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,440
So whether it's your junior or you, don't be bothered by it and head home.

188
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,530
- Okay.
- If you could leave earlier, I wouldn't need to pick you up either.

189
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,600
As long as you clearly explain why such specs are necessary, I'm sure they'll understand.

190
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,120
You've always been frank with me, right?

191
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,700
- So be frank with them, too.
- I can't.

192
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,550
Koyori?

193
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,210
We're behind schedule because I haven't been leading them properly.

194
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,200
I can't be frank, knowing I'm the reason for their stress.

195
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,930
I see.

196
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,220
It's the same with you.

197
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,640
There's no way I can be entirely frank with you.

198
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,210
Of course, I know that.

199
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,360
Oh my god.

200
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,600
Huh? What did Iー

201
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,230
I feel so stupid for getting irritated and worked up all on my own.

202
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,130
You don't have to force yourself to hold back your frustration.

203
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,340
Aren't you the one who's forcing yourself?

204
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,670
I don't think I am, though.

205
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,930
You said you wouldn't "need" to pick me up if I left earlier.

206
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:11,150
Oh, I meant it as we could leave together from the office instead.

207
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:17,230
I still feel bad making you come to get me whenever I work late.

208
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,930
Wait. You don't want me to pick you up?

209
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,640
Not that I don't want you to.

210
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,430
But you have early mornings and still come to get me, even if you're in the middle of dinner.

211
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,740
Just like you're worried about me,

212
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,970
I'm also worried about you.

213
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,990
I was going home on my own when I lived alone, so I'll be fine.

214
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,980
I get it now. I won't pick you up anymore.

215
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,780
But promise you'll call if you see anyone suspicious nearby.

216
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,040
- I will.
- Good.

217
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,590
Let's go.

218
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:15,610
By the way, you always leave your towel hanging on the sofa.

219
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,500
Stop that bad habit, all right?

220
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,240
Sorry, I'll hang it back where it belongs next time.

221
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,740
- So there's nothing else?
- Yup. Everything's good.

222
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,950
As long as we're frank with each other, everything will surely be fine.

223
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,230
How could he forget after just one day?

224
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,420
Maybe we were better off...

225
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,070
"Better off..."?

226
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,280
Hoshi, let's call it here and grab some drinks.

227
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,460
You need to unwind once in a while.

228
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,100
- Huh?
- Or did you have plans with your boyfriend? It is Friday.

229
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,680
I don't have any plans in particular.

230
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,970
Let's do that. It's been a while.

231
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,840
All right!

232
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,990
- Do you want to join us, Enomoto?
- Yes, please!

233
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,130
- Ooh...
- Yay!

234
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,900
I'm working on a personal game, so I'll pass.

235
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,840
Gotcha!

236
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,590
- Thanks for the hard work!
- Cheers!

237
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,910
- Ms. Kihara, when you go "boom" like that, you're really cool.
- You're too loud.

238
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,230
And what do you mean by "boom"? Call me "mature," why don't you?

239
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,770
But I get what you mean.

240
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,860
Hey. Then, Enomoto, what vibe does Hoshi give you?

241
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,910
- Huh?
- Don't bother. Enomoto's sound effects don't make sense.

242
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,950
You agreed with his "boom," though.

243
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,000
For Ms. Hoshi, it's like a "whoosh" feeling.

244
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,850
- "Whoosh"?
- "Whoosh"?

245
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,890
And what does that mean?

246
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,750
"Whoosh," as in when you ride a roller-coaster?

247
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,320
It's the excitement before the drop,

248
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,100
the thrill and adrenaline rush when you fall, and the relief when it's all over.

249
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,500
That's how I feel when working with Ms. Hoshi.

250
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,090
I hope to keep having this kind of feeling moving forward.

251
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,470
Could it be that he...

252
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,700
Sorry.

253
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,530
I was the one who invited you guys, but I have to leave now.

254
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,180
- What?
- My share. Let me know on Monday if it's not enough.

255
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,500
- Wait a minute...
- Sorry, Hoshi.

256
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,480
I forgot that my cat is waiting for me.

257
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,220
You have a cat? Since when?

258
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,410
- Ms. Hoshi!
- Y-Yes?

259
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,100
- You see, I...
- Listen!

260
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,070
I have a boyfriend.

261
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,970
I know that.

262
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,560
You mentioned you have a date or something with him. Right?

263
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,010
Gosh, I misunderstood him!

264
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,370
Are you sighing because of your boyfriend?

265
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,080
You've been sighing the entire time today.

266
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,950
- Are things going south with him?
- Wrong.

267
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,380
Sorry.

268
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,390
Have you ever moved in together with a girlfriend?

269
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,830
No.

270
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,110
- You're living with your boyfriend, Ms. Hoshi?
- Yeah.

271
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,460
We moved in together not long ago.

272
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,780
Despite our long history, I'm only now realizing our different habits bother me.

273
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,350
He's my childhood friend, soー

274
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,290
- Your childhood friend?
- Too loud.

275
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,560
Speaking of, who was the one who confessed first?

276
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,540
- Him.
- Wow!

277
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,310
What's with that reaction?

278
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,560
He's your childhood friend?

279
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,840
I'm so envious.

280
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,540
Let's go, shall we?

281
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,530
Do you have any plans after this?

282
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,690
What?

283
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,100
I'm home.

284
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,940
I forgot about it again.

285
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,020
I guess I should stop using my towel in the living room.

286
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,410
I'll apologize to Koyori when she gets back.

288
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,240
[I'm heading home soon! No need to pick me up.]

289
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,090
Almost forgot.

290
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,550
I'm so tired.

291
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,680
Do you have plans after this?

292
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,180
What?

293
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,250
Do you normally have supper after drinking?

294
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,140
Huh? No, I don't. I'm leaving.

295
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,780
- But why? Let's go get supper.
- Go home.

296
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,490
Why does being around you always tire me out?

297
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,960
I didn't realize we both lived close by. What a coincidence.

298
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,320
But your home is in that direction, no?

299
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,590
Let's part ways here.

300
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,570
I can also go home by this route.

301
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,310
I'll walk you home on the way.

302
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,740
Is that so? Thanks.

303
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,950
- Mind if I drop by the convenience store?
- Go ahead.

304
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,360
Sorry, Hijiri.

305
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,260
Let's eat it together.
