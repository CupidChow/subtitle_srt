00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,163
I'm Jungkook's wife.

185
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,164
Ouch!

186
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,297
Any more questions?

187
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,219
Good. I'm late for work.

188
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,595
I'll go ahead.

189
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,806
Oh, no!

190
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,807
[Manny] Miss, wait!

191
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,312
[gentle music playing]

192
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,000
You take care.

193
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,960
I didn't mean to bother you.

194
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,254
Sorry for the inconvenience,
Mrs. Jungkook.

195
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,256
Why are you giving me this?

196
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,966
So I can see you again.

197
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,426
Give it back, okay?

198
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,761
Whoo!

199
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,974
[laughing] Yeah!

200
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,938
Thank you, Mrs. Jungkook!

201
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,275
Bye!

202
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,236
[Manny] Whoo!

203
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:19,493
-[music continues]
-[indistinct chatter]

204
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,494
[Lady E] <i>Hello!</i>

205
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,831
<i>Good day, my friends!</i>

206
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,125
<i>It's pouring outside.</i>

207
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,336
<i>Traffic is bad!</i>

208
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,920
<i>Philippines,</i>

209
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,505
<i>are we late again?</i>

210
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,798
<i>Kidding!</i>

211
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,925
<i>I am your one and only</i>

212
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,802
<i>Lady E.</i>

213
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,847
<i>Lady Eme… ly!</i>

214
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,350
[woman chattering indistinctly]

215
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,352
[Lady E] <i>It's true what they say.</i>

216
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,978
<i>Life is extra hard these days.</i>

217
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:46,937
Okay, okay.

218
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:47,938
[Lady E] <i>Hassle!</i>

219
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,398
<i>Haggard!</i>

220

<i>Oh my gosh!</i>

221
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,817
<i>Do we have a choice?</i>

222
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,528
<i>We chose this life!</i>

223
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,530
<i>Kidding!</i>

224
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,032
I'll send it, Ma.

225
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,285
[Lady E] <i>Anyway, that's it for today.</i>

226
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,121
<i>Time to chill.</i>

227
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,874
<i>Don't take life too seriously</i>

228
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,543
<i>because you can't get out of this alive.</i>

229
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,545
<i>Good-bye!</i>

230
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,130
Oh, my.

231
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,924
What time is it?

232
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,926
Madam Ayef is late again.

233
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,469
What's your excuse this time?

234
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,595
Traffic? Flooding?

235
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,222
Road works?

236
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,224
Transportation crisis, madam.

237
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,643
Whatever!

238
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,311
[dinging]

239
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,481
Looks like we're ready for the day.

240
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

241
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,402
here at 24-Ever

242
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,611
we are here to serve

243
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,030
because that's what the customers…

244
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,408
[in unison] deserve!

245
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,242
[dinging]

246
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,326
Time to work!

247
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,412
Sis, is this finished?

248
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,496
Not yet.

249
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,206
Can you finish it?

250
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,543
Just take them out.

251
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,963
[Ayef] Your time is up.

252
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:54,797
You're expired.

253
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,841
Thank you, canned goods.

254
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,760
You too.

255
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,679
How about you?

256
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,266
Thank you. Bye.

257
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,440
You still have some time left.
Enjoy the aircon.

258
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,108
Take care.

259
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,405
[bell dinging]

260
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,406
[Ayef] Sis,

261
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,490
are you okay?

262
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,534
Of course, I'm good.

263
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,703
[Jobert] Counter two, long line!

264
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,079
[Ayef] I got you, Joberto!

265
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,833
[scanner beeping]

266
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,001
Sis,

267
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,378
did you see Kookie's arm?

268
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,546
Yes, sis.

269
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:40,342
Her ugly, gaslighting boyfriend
hit her again.

270
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,927
[Ayef] She should report him.

271
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,429
I'll talk to her later.

272
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,431
I hope she listens to you though.

273
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,266
Your total bill is two hundred one pesos.

274
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,809
-Cash or QR?
-QR.

275
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,019
Please scan.

276
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,149
Go ahead! Ruin your lives
with your so-called love.

277
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,485
Ruin our lives?

278
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,488
Love is part of the human experience.

279
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,073
A cultural phenomenon that arises

280
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,118
partly due to social pressures
and expectations.

281
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:06,952
[customer] Thank you!

282
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,663
As if you don't get crazy
when you fall in love.

283
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,000
I mean, everybody gets crazy
when they're madly in love.

284
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,126
Right, ma'am?

285
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,002
Correct!

286
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,046
-Thank you!
-Babe, let's go.

287
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,340
Sis, please pray that I get accepted

288
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,842
to the Singaporean company I applied to.

289
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,512
So I can go there
straight after graduation.

290
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,846
Have I shown you my thesis?

291
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,223
Here.

292
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,270
[Jobert] Mmm… Nice!

293
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,234
It's so nice!

294
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,111
There's still a lot to be done

295
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,947
but your solution is to leave?

296
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,782
But…

297
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,953
why are you working here
if you have big dreams?

298
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,415
Pop off, sis!

299
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,003
It's not like that, madam.

300
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,255
I work here

301
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,507
because I get paid for my hard work.

302
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,800
I get to save money.

303
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,552
And it's near my house.

304
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,303
Convenient!

305
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,597
Whatever you say!

306
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,140
Oh, ma'am!

307
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,225
Look!

308
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,059
It's a sign.

309
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,062
October 4th is my graduation day.

310
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,897
After I graduate,

311
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,190
goodbye, 24-Ever,

312
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,233
goodbye, Philippines,

313
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,278
and hello, Singapore!

314
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,154
Ninety-two pesos, ma'am.

315
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,239
Do as you please!

316
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,950
But know that escaping isn't a solution.

317
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,328
Respect my opinion!

318
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,710
I'm not escaping, madam.

319
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,088
I just want to have control over my life.

320
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,590
If I stay here,

321
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,757
no matter how hard I work

322
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,009
and whatever I do,

323
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,427
nothing will ever happen.

324
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,053
Respect the truth

325
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,348
so I can respect your opinion, madam.

326
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,726
My dear, life isn't like that.

327
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,561
You can't control everything.

328
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,813
Your payment, please.

329
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,856
Done.

330
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,316
Payment sent.

331
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,986
[nurse] Dobs, that's beautiful!

332
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,987
What's your inspiration?

333
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,156
[Dobs] The show that Manny
and I love to watch.

334
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,283
But he doesn't have time for me lately.

335
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,200
[Manny] Hey!

336
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,577
I'm back from an adventure!

337
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,536
Sir Manny!

338
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,537
What's up?

339
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,580
Bro!

340
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,706
Hey, hey, hey!

341
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,875
[Dobs] Manny,

342
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,835
you didn't bring me with you.

343
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,421
Dobs, it's better that you didn't come.

344
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,506
There were a lot of enemies.

345
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,507
Good thing I have a

346
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,468
golden sword!

347
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,345
Our favorite character
doesn't use that anymore.

348
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,139
He uses a night sword now.

349
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,100
You don't know because
you don't watch anymore.

350
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,520
So…

351
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,315
just because I used the wrong sword,

352
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,360
you don't like me anymore?

353
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:49,239
I got wounded in the fight.

354
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,200
Really?

355
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,827
Ouch!

356
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,955
[Dobs giggling]

357
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:56,872
[Agnes] Dobs,

358
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,541
son, please have dinner.

359
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,585
[Manny] You still haven't eaten?

360
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,628
He still hasn't eaten?

361
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,421
-Not yet.
-Look at this.

362
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,425
[Manny] This is a new concept!

363
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,511
You just thought of this now?

364
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,223
Eat first and then you can continue that.

365
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,433
Go on. Eat a lot!

366
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,435
-Dobs.
-[Viviana] Hey!

367
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,771
I've been craving Japanese mayo lately.

368
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,855
Hey!

369
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,940

look like a Japanese cow?

Wagyu?

372
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,947
Ma'am, do you want me to make you a drink?

373
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,243
Sure. Ah…

374
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,954
Cucumber with celery and green pepper.

375
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,706
Okay, ma'am.

Mm?

378
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,384
Who's the father?

379
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,972
Do you plan on telling Daddy?

380
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,394
I can't wait to give birth

381
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,813
so I can finally
move into my own apartment.

382
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,776
Dad, it's just one dinner.

383
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,863
I'm sure your secretary
can find some time for us.

[Wilfredo] <i>If you want me</i>

00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,369
<i>You know how busy I am.</i>

387
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,537
Dad,

388
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,164
you know that my focus

389
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,082
is growing my business, right?

390
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,751
<i>The plant shop?</i>

391
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,836
<i>You're just wasting money.</i>

392
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,172
I don't think so, Dad.

393
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,715
It has potential.

394
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,759
I invested my savings there.

395
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,634
<i>Precisely.</i>

396
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,761

397
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,846

398
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,516

400
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,896
<i>For our company?</i>

401
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,315
Dad, maybe you could train somebody else.

402
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,775
<i>Who? Dobs?</i>

403
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,777

-Dad, about Dobs…
-<i>Grow up!</i>

407
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,994
I was thinking if I…

408
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,496
<i>Enough about that kid.</i>

409
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,458
<i>I will only come to that dinner</i>
<i>if you work for me.</i>

410
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,961
I'll consider it

411
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,048
as long as you go to our birthday dinner.

412
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,800

413
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,551

OH NO…

428
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,049
SHE HAS NO HEART?

429

THIS IS YOUR FAULT!

430
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,011

Does it look okay?
It's still a little rough.

435
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,394
I plan to edit the background.

436
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,895

00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,926
Then I'll do my job and serve him.

549
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,969
Is that so?

550
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,429
Is he not your type?

551
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,598
He's okay…

552
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,725

[Manny] Ayef…

567
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,340
So "Ayef" is the real name of

568

Mrs. Jungkook.

569

571
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,741
Give that to me!

572

what they deserve.

579

Miss, how much are the…

580
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,108
pies?

581
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,485
35 and 37, sir,

582
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,528
it's written in there.

583
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,238
What are the flavors?

584
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,283
Ham and cheese. Tuna and cheese.
You may read it there, sir.

585
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,494
Are you required to be rude?

586
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,704
To those who will make a scene.

587
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,663
I'm not making a scene.

588

Anything else, sir?

That's all.

00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,734
Okay, that will be…

Ah, miss!

606
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,655

00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,651
Okay, Ben 1 and Ben 2.

623
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,485
[Ben 2] Yes!

624
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,361
Taste this.

625
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,362
It's so delicious.

626
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:00,905
[Ben 1] Thank you, boss.

627
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,324
Is there free coffee too, boss?

628
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:04,826
You want coffee, B2?

629
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,785
Mm-hmm.

630
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,870
No problem,

631
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,496
just help me.

632
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,456
Hmm.

[Fetussa] My, my, my.

637
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,590
I know where this is going.

638
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,592
Let's look at the IG bio.

639
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,471
"It's not easy to be me."

00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,638
-So dramatic!
-That's it!

641
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,765
That's enough!

642
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,016
-[Ayef] Give it back!
-[overlapping chatter]

643
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,268
-Oops, liked his pic!
-[Ayef] I saw that--

644
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,521
Ah!

645
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,023
Oh, no!

646
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,734
We're not looking for trouble.

647
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,069
Trouble found us!

"Imperfect perfectionist.

651
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,956
Oh!

652
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,375
Oh, no! He's hiding something!

653
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,544
Is he single?

654
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,005
Well, well, well…

655
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,381
Wait, maybe she's taken.

656
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,468
Nope, no boyfriend.

657
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,928
That's right.

658
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,971
What if she has a girlfriend?

659
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:07,972
Give me that!

660
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,140
Boyfriend!

661
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,975
-Boyfriend material!
-Are you sure?

662
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,727
It's giving fun!
It's giving energy! It's giving--

663
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,978
It's giving we're not meant to be.

664
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:14,979
[Fetussa] Oh!

665
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,273
You're so judgmental!

666
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,025
First of all,

667
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,026
he's young!

668
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:20,985
Ah! Yes!

669
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:21,945
Second,

670
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,363
he's just having fun!

671
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,614
[Jobert, Kookie] Yes!

672
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,907
Lastly…

673
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,784
-He is handsome! [shrieks]
-Yes!

674
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,660
[overlapping chatter]

675
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,453
-That.
-[Fetussa] Yes!

676
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,539
Enough, we're not compatible.

677
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,624
He has time on his hands. I don't.

678
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,750
I don't even have a choice

679
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,711
because I was not born rich
with generational wealth!

680
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,046
And I have plans.

681
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,172
I know what I want,

682
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,299
and nothing can stop me.

683
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,218
No one.

684
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:48,221
Ayef, I honestly think you like him.

685
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,806
Don't deny it!

686
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,268
Not the usual type.

687
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,270
Interesting.

688
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,355
I want to get to know her.

689
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,773
I need to get to know her!

690
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,567
Aggressive.

691
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,734
Rawr! I like it!

692
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,152

[Kookie] Oh, no!

Oh my gosh! It's HalaManny!

696
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,163
Stop it! You already have a kid.

697
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,332
Whatever!

698
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,084
[Kookie] Hi, sir.

699
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,252
Hi!

700
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,253
What time do you finish?

701
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,213
-Huh?
-What time do you get off work?

702
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,133
Sorry, sir. We don't sell
personal information here.

703
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,092

704
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,385
My treat.

705
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,887
What time do you get off work?

706
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,309
[indistinct chatter]

707
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,852
[Ayef] I'll only give you fifteen minutes.

708
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,604
Just think of this as a free trial.

709
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,317
You're pressuring me.

710
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,527
I'm being paid per hour.

711
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,987
I don't like to be deducted.

712
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,031
I mean, I don't even love you.

713
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,407
So, if you love the person,

714
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,867
your time is not limited?

715
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,243
It's expensive to love.

716
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,953
I'm just a minimum-wager.

717
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,541
You're good at drawing.

718
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,542
I saw it on your IG.

719
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,460
Are you an artist?

720
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,794
Are you a stalker?

721
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,004
You liked my picture first.

I'm finishing school before I leave.

724
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,098
I want to work as an animator abroad.

725
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,601
Why don't you like it here?

726
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,189
There's no future for artists here.

727
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,732
And…

728
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,317
pay is low.

729
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,819

00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,240
<i>How true is that?</i>

733
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,117
[Wilfredo]<i> Those complaints have no basis.</i>

734
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,494
<i>All they do is whine.</i>

735
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,954
<i>You won't prosper</i>

736
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,330
<i>if you are lazy.</i>

737
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,208
-[waitress] I work but I don't prosper!
-<i>The problem with these protestors…</i>

738
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,125
-[Ayef] Right?
-[waitress] Right!

739
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,835
[Ayef] No matter how hard you work,
you'll get nowhere.

740
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,546
<i>…is that they want to be regularized,</i>
<i>yet their work is substandard.</i>

741
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,381
What a jerk!

742
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,549
You can only speak like that
because you are rich!

743
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,801
What an arrogant man!

744
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,095
-Right, miss? The nerve!
-[reporter] <i>Mr. Siena, thank you.</i>

745
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,348
-[man] Where's my juice?
-[waitress] Coming!

746
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,016
Don't be so harsh on my father.

747
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,268
Really?

748
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,728
That's your father?

749
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,689
You're joking.

750
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,817
Stop messing around.

751
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:08,987
Is that really your father?

752
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,994
Sorry.

753
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,413
I didn't know.

754
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,291
That's okay! What am I? Sensitive?

755
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,294
Wait…

756
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,839
If he is your father,

757
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,590
didn't we meet at the rally?

758
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,135
So you're fighting against him?

759
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,263
First of all, he doesn't know.

760
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,889
Second,

761
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:41,019
I'm just helping the people
that I can help.

762
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,023
I'm just doing
and standing for what's right.

763
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,608
If you're a rich kid,

764
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,736
what are you doing in our store?

765
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,571
And now you pretending to eat cheap food?

766
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,033
Do rich people like you have a thing
for us oppressed people?

767
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,287
You're my type.

768
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,664
As simple as that.

769
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,208
You're judgmental.

770
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,293
Huh?

771
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,544
You're a player.

772
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,837
You're so good at flirting.

773
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,172
Bravo!

774
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,550
[sarcastic laugh]

775
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:16,012
You should smile more often. It suits you.

776
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,431
Stop it!

777
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,100
Stop with your pickup lines!

778
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,394
Why?

779
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,730
Do I look prettier when I smile?

780
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,856
Yes.

781
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,275
[gentle music playing]

782
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,777
You look beautiful when you're happy.

783
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,333
Time seems so fast!

784
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,876
Okay, let me ask questions this time.

785
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,253
Did you break up with Jungkook?

786
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,213
No.

787
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,380
We're married.

788
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,299
There's no divorce in the Philippines,

789
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,467
so we will be together forever.

790
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,468
Does he know?

791
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,178
I hope he knows.

792
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,262
You know what?

793
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,932
I'll be honest with you.

794
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,643
You're cute. You're my type.

795
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,479
But I'm not looking for someone.

796
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,731
It's easy to meet somebody,
but it's hard to be in a relationship.

797
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,900
So, let's not waste
each other's time because…

798
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,527
this has no future.

799
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,570
Wait, I was just asking
if you have a boyfriend.

800
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,531
Why does it feel like
you want us to end up together?

801
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,658
Are you expecting that?

802
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:19,992
Whoa! [laughs]

803
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:20,993
Me?

804
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:21,953
[laughs]

805
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:22,870
Me?

806
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:27,458
Then why did you come to the store
and buy all the pies?

807
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,335
Also…

808
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,711
you stalked my IG.

809
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,590
Lastly, you asked me out on a date.

810
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,551
Am I really the one with expectations?

811
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,845
Fake news.

812
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,847
I thought you didn't love me yet?

813
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,181
Why are you calling this a date?

814
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,474
And also…

815
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,769
if you want to call this a date, I'm in.

816
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,229
If you want to.

817
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,438
Because I would love to.

818
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:54,485
[gentle music continues]

819
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,745
Hey, I still have two minutes.

820
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,372
Two minutes

821
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,415
to walk back to the store.

822
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,291
Right?

823
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,834
Your free trial is over.

824
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:10,668
Okay?

825
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,420
Okay. Bye! Thank you!

826
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,176
[Manny] Wait, I have something to say.

827
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,887
Go ahead, say it while we're walking.

828
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,804
I like you.

829
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,098
Where are you going?

830
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,349
I said I like you.

831
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,186
I'm gonna leave you.

832
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,645
I'm leaving.

833
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,730
You'll get hurt.

834
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,613
Didn't you hear me?

835
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,742
I said I like you.

836
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,453
1-4-3.

837
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,330
I like you.

838
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,751
Didn't you hear me?

839
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,544
I said

840
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,296
you'll get hurt.

841
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:57,840
Let's see.

842
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,350
[chiming]

843
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,895
[upbeat music playing]

844
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,355
One hundred forty-three, sir.

845
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,981
How much? 143?

846
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,942
143.

847
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,527
1-4-3 too.

848
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,866
[both squealing]

849
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,826
[Jobert] 1-4-3, Ayef?

850
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,873
The total amount is on the screen.

851
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:39,090
1-4-3, sir!

852
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,050
1-4-3.

853
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,599
1-4-3, sir!

854
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,317
Mmm!

855
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:02,154
That will be 357, sir!

856
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,827
Your change is…

857
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:09,912
One…

858
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,997
Four…

859
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,333
Three.

860
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:22,925
Thank you.

861
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,345
Nice to hear it back from you.

862
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,768
-HALAMANNY'S NICE!
-NO CUSTOMERS THOUGH.

863
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,854
I HOPE AYEF VISITS.

864
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:58,794
Is it closed?

865
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,629
[Manny] Ayef, is that you?

866
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,214
Ayef!

867
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,507
Ayef.

868
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:05,843
Come in.

[chill music playing]

00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,690
Welcome to HalaManny!

871
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,446
[Ayef] Mmm…

872
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,449
Do you like plants so much

873
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,118
that you even turned it into a business?

874
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,164
Actually, my brother
is obsessed with plants.

875
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,624
He has been since we were kids.

876
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,834
That is why I was influenced as well.

877
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,879
I just built this so that

878
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:45,716
I could have a business
I could call my own.

879
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,177
What is a terrarium?

880
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,554
Come look at it.

881
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:10,950
Wait, I'll just set this up.

882
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:12,910
What is that?

883
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,537
It's the magical cube.

884
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,831
Mmm…

885
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,542
Okay, game.

00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,628
Let's start with the base.

887
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,839
This is the soil.

888
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,048
I'll teach you everything, okay?

889
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,813
Why do you make terrariums?

890
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,943
[Manny] Because…

891
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,528
I can relate to them.

892
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,281
[Manny] <i>I believe…</i>

893
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,867
<i>we are just like terrariums.</i>

894
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,703
<i>We can be alone for a period of time.</i>

895
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,164
<i>But at some point,</i>

896
00:40:58,998 --> 00:40:59,999
<i>we all need</i>

897
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,751
to be taken care of…

898
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:06,964
and…

899
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,133
to be loved.

900
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,138
-Beautiful, isn't it?
-Huh?

901
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,347
Right.

902
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,682
Told you.

903
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,060
Want to make another one?

904
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,189
Wait, what time is it?

905
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,607
It's still early.

906
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,900
Huh? It's already late.

907
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,110
I might miss the jeepney.

908
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:28,944
Jeep?

909
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,988
-Yes, thank you, Manny.
-Are you sure?

910
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:31,864
-Yeah.
-Thank you too.

911

What about your terrariums?

I'll just pick them up tomorrow.

913

00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,459
[humming]

918
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,376
Hi, Dad!

919
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,045
Let's eat.

920
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,716
I'll get you a plate.

921
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,675
Wait.

922
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,676
I have a gift for you.

923
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,511
Shorts!

924
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,970
Try them.

925
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,557
Our neighbor, Ms. Elena,
wants me to resell them.

926
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,601
She says it can be my side job.

927
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,686
There you go again, Dad.

928
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,689
I can buy things for myself.

929
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:06,732
You're a big girl already?

930
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,650
Yes.

931
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,819
As big as that smile on your face?

932
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:15,157
You've had this wide smile
since you came in.

933
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,075
What are you smiling about?

934
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,661
-Mm-mm.
-Hmm?

935
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,787
Uh…

936
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,288
I met someone.

937
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,998
-[door opens]
-Who is it?

938
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:24,959
[Terry] Who did you meet?

939
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,461
What are you two talking about?

940
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,796
Ayef said…

941
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,672
[Terry sighs deeply]

942
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,839
…she met someone.

943
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,967
You know what?
You'll really meet a lot of people

944
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,677
in the convenience store.

945
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,136
Which is good for you

946
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,556
because you are an introvert.

947
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,851
That is why I also keep telling you
to quit animation.

948
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,812
You'll gain nothing from that.

949
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,564
There's no future there. No money.

950
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,940
Waste of time.

951
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,441
Waste of energy.

952
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,318
That's why, after you graduate,

953
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,445
I will submit an application
for you to the hotel. Okay?

954
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,530
Mom…

955
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,241
You know what? Earlier, it was so crazy.

956
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,826
Work was so tiring!

957
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,996
I just want to get rich so I can relax.

958
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:08,210
One of the bellboys
in the hotel is so stupid.

959
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,169
He couldn't follow any instructions.

960
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,172
He didn't know I would be the one
to get in trouble if he messed up.

961
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,551
Maybe he didn't understand
your instructions.

962
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,719
Filemon!

963
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:17,636
What?

964
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,180
I'm not asking for your opinion.

965
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,100
-No! You want a fight!
-I don't want to start a fight.

966
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,977
-You're saying I'm wrong!
-I don't want to start a fight.

967
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,855
You're putting words in my mouth.
You're not the one I'm talking to!

968
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,107
I was just wondering if the bellboy--

969
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,443
You have no right to give an opinion

970
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,446
because you don't put food on the table!

971
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,281
I'm just saying that your
instructions might be--

972
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:43,037
[bright music playing]

973
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,163
[notification pings]

974
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:51,253
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL TERRARIUM.
BUT YOU'RE SO MUCH MORE.

975
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,092
[woman] Can I top up?

976
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,345
-Fifty pesos worth, please.
-[chiming]

977
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,262
Hmm.

978
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,264
Oh, my!

979
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,309
It seems like she's waiting for someone.

980
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,393
You and your imagination!

981
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,728
Try writing it in Notepad.

982
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,771
Hmph!

983
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,190
-Deny it all you want.
-[chiming]

984
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,484
-[doorbell rings]
-Yes?

985
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,154
-Son!
-Ma!

986
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,656
[both chuckle]

987
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,200
Wow! I missed you!

988
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,034
I missed you!

989
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,661
I brought you a gift!

990
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:24,495
Wow!

991
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,455
What is this?

992
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:27,373
Hey.

993
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,042
Manila traffic is still terrible.

994
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,462
Hasn't this country
changed for the better?

995
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,506
What is this?

996
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,883
That is a Red Valentine, Ma.

997
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,677
From my new business.

998
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,596
Ma…

999
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,182
You've been here for a week already?

1000
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,477
If Viviana hadn't told me
I wouldn't even have known--

1001
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,145
So this is your new business?

1002
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,190
I'm so proud of you, my son.

1003
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,566
You haven't even graduated,

1004
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,984
and yet you're already business-minded!

1005
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:56,944
You know what?

1006
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,822
You take that after your father.

1007
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,615
[Meryl laughs]

1008
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,283
Ma, I graduated two years ago.

1009
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,661
Of course.

1010
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,121
You've graduated!

1011
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,164
Now can I get you a drink?

1012
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,040
Huh?

1013
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,752
Remember, Ma? You were in Europe
during my graduation to unwind.

1014
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,922
Meanwhile, Dad was at a business summit--

1015
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,550
This is so nice.

1016
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,093
You gotta try this.

1017
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,845
[sad music playing]

1018
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:23,971
Here you go.

1019
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:25,556
Thank you, Ma.

1020
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,766
So, anyway,

1021
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,976
my Emmanuel.

1022
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:33,480
I got your texts on Dob's birthday party.

1023
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,817
I just want to make one thing clear, okay?

1024
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,611
Dobs is your brother, right?

1025
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,988
Mm-hmm.

1026
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,198
But he is not my son.

1027
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:48,579
That is why I don't want to go
to that birthday party.

1028
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,830
But Mom--

1029
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,915
I have already moved on

1030
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,627
and put your dad's infidelities behind me.

1031
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,881
I don't want to have a flashback moment.

1032
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:03,594
So why, oh why, will I have to attend

1033
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,555
this former cook's son's

1034
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,098
birthday party?

1035
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,436
Ma, maybe you forgot.

1036
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,230
Dobs and I were born on the same day.

1037
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:20,486
[sad music swells]

1038
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,946
It's also your son's birthday.

1039
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,492
It's also my birthday.

1040
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,460
Anyway, Ma.

1041
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:37,878
I'll go ahead.

1042
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,213
I don't want to disturb you.

1043
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,048
[smooches] Thank you for having me.

1044
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:42,466
Take care.

1045
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,932
[Jobert] Anything else?

1046
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,976
How about me? Want my number?

1047
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,436
What a snob.

1048
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,771
[customer] Whatever.

1049
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,272
Sir Manny.

1050
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,275
Do you know where Ayef is?

1051
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,328
Dad…

1052
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:12,829
Ayef, you're here.

1053
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,707
Why are you still fixing that?

1054
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,084
That's broken.

1055
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,336
Let's just buy a new one on payday.

1056
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,380
No, I will fix that.

1057
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,259
I bought you something.

1058
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,927
Wait, let me get it.

1059
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,388
Daddy…

1060
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,099
Dear.

1061
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:37,771
[clattering]

1062
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,566
This is my account.

1063
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,568
-[door opens]
-Mom?

1064
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,444
Yes?

1065
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,281
Why is my account logged into here?

1066
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,326
And why are my emails deleted?

1067
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,246
I don't know.

1068
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,250
[stammers] I used it earlier.

1069
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,335
Maybe I clicked something.

1070
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,462
You know I'm not very techy.

1071
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,505
[Ayef] Wait…

1072
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,216
And why are only emails
from Singapore deleted?

1073
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:14,141
Are you trying to stop me from leaving?

1074
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,730
You know what?

1075
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,525
I submitted an application
for you to the hotel.

1076
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,444
The pay is good.

1077
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:28,697
Mom, I want to work abroad!

1078
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,074
I don't like it here!

1079
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,326
You know what?

1080
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,331
-Eat first, you're overreacting.
-Mom this is my life!

1081
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,708
We're talking about my life!

1082
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,460
[Filemon] Ayef.

1083
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,838
Lower your voice.

1084
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,675
Dad, this may sabotage my application.

1085
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,678
Dad, please speak up!

1086
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,140
Filemon, look at your daughter.

1087
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,267
Look at her.

1088
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,021
She thinks she knows what she's doing.

1089
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,022
Are you sure about this?

1090
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,025
Have you decided?

1091
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,029
You should actually thank me
for looking after you.

1092
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,532
You make decisions based on a whim.

1093
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,575
I should know.

1094
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,119
You can't even take care of yourself,

1095
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,954
yet you want to live away from us?

1096
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,667
Mom, it was just one time.

1097
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,586
I made a mistake.

1098
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,338
I'm trying to make things right again.

1099
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,214
You're trying?

1100
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,217
There's no more time to try.

1101
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,053
What we need now is to be sure.

1102
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,263
[Terry] You wasted so much time already.

1103
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,100
You wasted so many opportunities.

1104
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,976
We allowed you to have a boyfriend.

1105
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,146
We supported you in everything you wanted.

1106
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,026
[Terry] And what happened?

1107
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,277
You did not graduate!

1108
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,571
It took you two years to finish school!

1109
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,490
You even promised me…

1110
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:54,991
"Mommy, after I finish high school,

1111
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,618
after I graduate…"

1112
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,036
Did anything happen?

1113
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,788
Nothing!

1114
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,833
When you were doing that,
did you think of us?

1115
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,836
Did we ever cross your mind?

1116
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,629
Did you think about your dad?

1117
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,800
You squandered our trust in you!

1118
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:22,728
Dad…

1119
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,526
Don't you trust me either?

1120
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,704
[Terry] I admit,

1121
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,458
I deleted all your Singapore emails.

1122
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,669
Because I was applying for
a job on a cruise ship.

1123
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,963
It's a good opportunity. The pay is good.

1124
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:53,300
It's not as if we can both leave
at the same time.

1125
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,677
If you're all leaving…

1126
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,639
can we even call this a family?

1127
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,185
Filemon…

1128
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,729
If you are going to insist
on what you want,

1129
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:11,568
then let's just see who gets to leave
this hellhole first.

1130
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,112
[Terry] That's it.

1131
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:19,201
[somber music playing]

1132
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,129
[music stops]

1133
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:38,386
["Pinadama" by Zack Tabudlo playing]

["Pinadama" continues playing]

1135
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,348
Let it out, Ayef.

1136
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:10,604
Whoo!

1137
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:16,443
[Ayef] Whoo!

1138
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,421
Thank you.

1139
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,890
[Ayef] What a hassle.

1140
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,405
What happened?

1141
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:09,496
[sighs] My mom's trying to sabotage
my application for Singapore.

1142
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,749
She doesn't trust me anymore.

1143
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,926
I had my first boyfriend…

1144
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,719
[exhales]

1145
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,972
…when I was graduating high school.

1146
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:28,848
Damn,

1147
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,851
love consumed me.

1148
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,228
I gave up everything.

1149
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,563
That's just how I love.

1150
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,606
Boundaries?

1151
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,649
[scoffs]

1152
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,984
What's that, right?

1153
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,820
[pensive music playing]

1154
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,989
Then he just left me.

1155
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,117
Hassle.

1156
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,954
I was running for valedictorian.

1157
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:55,083
But I lost my chance.

1158
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,508
Think about it.

1159
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,806
My parents sacrificed a lot for me.

1160
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,021
My mom was going to be a lawyer.

1161
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:21,401
My dad was going to work abroad.

1162
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:25,280
Their plans were ruined when they had me.

1163
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,576
Sometimes I want to believe

1164
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,705
that I am the biggest
inconvenience in their lives.

1165
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,545
They weren't able to fulfill their dreams
because of me.

1166
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,176
Maybe that's why I don't deserve

1167
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,635
to fulfill mine.

1168
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,018
Sorry,

1169
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,478
I'm being dramatic.

1170
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,189
Why are you apologizing to me?

1171
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,608
Don't think like that.

1172
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,611
You deserve everything
that's meant for you.

1173
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:08,114
You're really like a superhero, huh?

1174
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,366
Always there to save the day.

1175
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,118
You must have it easy.

1176
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,078
Not true.

1177
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,121
For starters,

1178
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,166
my parents are separated.

1179
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,088
My mother? She's busy having
another life of her own.

1180
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,799
My dad, on the other hand…

1181
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,886
He's busy ruining the lives of others.

1182
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,306
Just tonight,

1183
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,726
my own mother forgot my birthday.

1184
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,440
Sorry.

1185
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,196
We're so dramatic.

1186
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:49,614
Let's just eat.

1187
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,533
Are you sure this is good?

1188
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,326
That's delicious!

1189
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,413
What?

1190
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,748
It's okay.

1191
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,792
I'm kidding. It's good!

1192
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:01,835
[laughs]

1193
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,048
But why is it that

1194
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:12,095
the people we love hurt us the most?

1195
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,639
Shouldn't love do the opposite?

1196
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,850
If it did, I would love more often.

1197
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,561
A love that's there when you need it.

1198
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:24,190
Yes. And which doesn't get mad
if you don't reply immediately.

1199
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,442
A love that doesn't judge,

1200
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,153
but instead accepts you, flaws and all.

1201
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:31,156
And forgives even when
you don't apologize.

1202
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,907
And waits for you to be okay

1203
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,492
when you've had a crappy day.

1204
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,411
But never leaves…

1205
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,413
[both] …when you need it.

1206
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:40,999
Right!

1207
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:44,919
[both laugh]

1208
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,755
Love should be like that.

1209
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,008
Just happiness.

1210
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,801
No pain.

1211
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,345
Like us?

1212
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,685
What if we become a couple?

1213
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,901
Are you serious?

1214
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,612
Ayef, my world sucks right now.

1215
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,363
Really.

1216
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,157
But…

1217
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,534
but when I met you,

1218
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,830
I said to myself,

1219
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,624
"I'm glad she's here.

1220
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,169
Because suddenly,

1221
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,839
it's possible for me to be happy."

1222
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,428
Me too.

1223
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,182
I want to be happy.

1224
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:49,067
But if we're going to do this,

1225
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,779
our love should be convenient.

1226
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,864
As convenient as these cup noodles.

1227
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,950
[laughs]

1228
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,494
But what if

1229
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,788
we become an inconvenience to one another?

1230
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:02,997
We end it.

1231
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,499
Bye-bye.

1232
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,630
Game?

1233
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,433
Game.

1234
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,393
[chiming]

1235
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:24,519
[Ayef] <i>To make it clear,</i>

1236
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,437
<i>there must be a written contract.</i>

1237
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,897
Do's and don'ts.

1238
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,566
A set of rules.

1239
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,985
A relationship like a partnership.

1240
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,611
-No mess.
-Mm-hmm.

1241
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,613
-No fuss.
-Exactly!

1242
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,532
First,

1243
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:38,616
I don't like cringey stuff.

1244
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,451
Don't pick me up.

1245
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,287
No weeksary and monthsary

1246
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,247
because we'll never reach an anniversary.

1247
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,040
1. NO CRINGINESS

1248
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,959
Wait! What's wrong with…

1249
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,628
darling…

1250
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,171
sweetheart…

1251
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,464
babe…

1252
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,382
baby…

1253
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,842
sugar plum?

1254
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,094
Are you that edgy?

1255
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:01,973
What's wrong is it makes me want to vomit.

1256
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:05,643
Number two. Our love should be practical.

1257
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,604
No gifts. No spoiling each other.

1258
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,814
I'm not wasting my salary on you.

1259
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:12,066
We can't celebrate monthsary
and I can't buy you gifts?

1260
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,943
Damn right. This isn't a grocery.

1261
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,612
We don't need a month-end report.

1262
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:21,200
And lastly, we should practice the 3 Cs.

1263
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,828
What's that?

1264
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:27,248
Number one. Consent.

1265
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:30,043
-Consent? No problem.
-Yes.

1266
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,544
First base?
Second base?

1267
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,005
Consent is a must no matter what.

1268
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,425
This feels like a job application.

1269
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,968
I'm up for regularization.

1270
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,930
And if you don't compromise,

1271
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,682
you'll be up for termination.

1272
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,892
[chuckles]

1273
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,146
Okay. Last C.

1274
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:53,775
This should be convenient.

1275
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,403
So my proposal is

1276
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,322
that our relationship
must have a deadline.

1277
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:02,909
Manny, we're breaking up in October.

1278
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,035
Okay?

1279
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:05,787

01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:38,234
I'm just waiting for our birthday.

1461
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,320
I plan to announce my plans there.

1462
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:43,572
I'll take care of Dobs.

1463
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,075
I will enroll him.

1464
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,079
What if he gets mad?

1465
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:52,873
I will do everything for Dobs.

1466
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,458
Everything.

1467
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,087
That's how I love.

1468
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,813
You have a huge crush on me, don't you?

1469
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:17,022
Don't be too obvious.

1470
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,023
[scoffs]

1471
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:21,068
You're so full of yourself.

1472
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:22,111
Whatever.

1473
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:32,621
The rain is crazy.

1474
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,999
I should've gone home earlier.

1475
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:36,208
What a hassle.

1476
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:37,876
[exhales]

1477
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:44,174
Sorry for the inconvenience.

1478
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,176
What are we going to do now?

1479
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:49,263
I'm the reason for this inconvenience.

1480
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,099
-So, are we breaking up now?
-Huh?

1481
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:56,228
You already hassled me,
but you're calling it off?

1482
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,563
What about you?

1483
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,982
Are you willing
to be inconvenienced for me?

1484
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,445
It's over.

1485
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:06,071
Let's break up.

1486
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:07,573
Oh well.

[Ayef] Hey!

1489
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:17,124
[Manny] You want me to be
inconvenienced, right?

1490
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:18,667
What are you doing?

1491
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,085
Come back here!

1492
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,213
Ayef, this is such a hassle!

1493
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:24,757
[Manny] What a hassle!

1494
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,510
Ayef, I'm cold!

1495
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:31,972
[laughs]

1496
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,768
Okay, fine!

1497
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:37,686
[Manny] Never mind then!

Nothing.

1504
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:49,216
Except look at you. That's enough for me.

1505
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:51,802
Really?

1506
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,179

You don't know?

Your father finally raised our salary.

That's good, right?

1527
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,423
It's in our favor.

1528
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,467

1536
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:38,992

1537

Dear? You got an interview for Singapore?

1548
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,810
-Yes, Dad.
-Singapore! Singapore!

1549
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,312
-I can fit in your suitcase.
-Of course.

1550
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,855
-Singapore!
-Singapore.

1551
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:09,982
[Filemon] Congrats, Ayef.

1552
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,525
I'm so excited for you.

1553
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:13,443
I'll prepare your things.

1554
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:19,616

Dad?

1557
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:24,621
Manny.

1558
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,124
[Manny] I didn't know you were…

1559
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,750
gonna be here.

1560
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,503
[Viviana] No one knows
when he's gonna be here.

1561
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,505
Even Auntie doesn't know.

1562
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,133
[Viviana] I'll be surprised
if she does. [chuckles]

1563
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:38,885
[Wilfredo] Manny.

1564
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:41,471
Your funny little brother

1565
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:43,974
was showing me this funny little clip.

1566
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,935
And he was pointing at this guy here

1567
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:49,104
in this stupid costume.

1568
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:50,230
He said

1569
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:52,024
this is you.

1570
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:53,609
[laughs]

1571
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,736
Your brother is so funny.

1572
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:57,654
His head is up in space.

1573
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,741
Ah, Agnes…

1574
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,702
In your opinion,

1575
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,454
does Manny think that he can be

1576
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:07,122
better than his dad?

1577
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:10,250
And if that's the case,

1578
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:13,462
then sadly, I must say,

1579
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:14,671
he is wrong--

1580
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:16,048
That's really Manny, Dad.

1581
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:19,760
You might have poor eyesight.

1582
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:22,596
-Dobs.
-I read that when you grow old,

1583
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,222
you'll have poor eyesight.

1584
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:25,641
Then you'll be hospitalized--

1585
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:26,767
[Wilfredo] Shut up!

1586
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:28,352
[Manny] Dad.

1587
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:31,188
[Wilfredo] You know what? I'd better go.

1588
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:36,610
I have to deal with my workers.

1589
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:42,949
HI CHOO, ARE YOU OFF WORK?

1590
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,785
[Jobert] Madam is asking
if we can do OT tonight.

1591
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:45,619
I HAVE ERRANDS TONIGHT…

1592
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:47,537
[Jobert] I'm sure we're
not going to get paid for it.

1593
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:48,497
CAN YOU COME WITH ME?

1594
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,998
[Kookie] Right? Or she might
pay with pizza again.

1595
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,667
SORRY CHOO, I JUST REALLY
NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

1596
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,419
[Kookie] It's not like we can
cash those pizza slices.

1597
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,004
WHERE ARE YOU?

1598
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,089
[Jobert] Sissy,

1599
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,466
I'm so tired of being poor.

1600
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:00,592
I can't take it.

1601
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,843
Sissy…

1602
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,429
Can you cover for my OT?

1603
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,390
I have plans. I can't do OT.

1604
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:07,516
Wait.

1605
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,476
Where are you going?

1606
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:10,477
This is a first.

1607
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,938
-I made plans with Manny.
-[Kookie] Oh, wow.

1608
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:15,315
Whatever, Ayef. You're pissing me off.

1609
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:18,026
Enjoy yourself and take care.

1610
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,320
Give my regards to Manny.

1611
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:23,031
[Kookie] Go ahead.
I'll be at your station.

1612
01:18:37,337 --> 01:18:38,505
[Manny] Shall we go?

1613
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:45,303
I know how to make you happy.

1614
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,972
Why don't we eat first?

1615
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:51,351
Do you want me to cook for you?

1616
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,436
How?

1617
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,480
Come here, take a seat.

1618
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,571
Ooh, it's hot. Ouch!

1619
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:04,156
Here you go.

1620
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,323
Here's your beef stew.

1621
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,616
Taste it.

1622
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:14,249
This is so delicious.

1623
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,586
Are the kids asleep?

1624
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:21,298
Because if they are…

1625
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:30,807
We can finally…

1626
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,312
watch a movie and chill.

1627
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:38,356
-Here. It's going down.
-Here it comes.

1628

Where's our bathroom?

01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:51,203
Let's go.

1633
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:53,663
Can you hand me the towel?

1634
01:19:56,374 --> 01:19:57,876
Mm. [grunts]

1635
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,588
Wanna join me?

1636
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:03,715
Catch me first.

1638
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:06,301
Come here.

1639

It's so fun in here,
it's like a playground.

1640
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,348
Are you okay now?

1641
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:13,683
As long as you're here.

1642
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:15,685
Whatever.

1643
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:19,105
This is so beautiful.

1644
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:20,982
You know what?

1645
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:23,777
If I will have my own room in Singapore,
I bet it will look like this.

1646
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:25,904
These curtains,

1647
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:29,533
these cute lights,
and this soft and fluffy bed.

1648
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:33,036
A mini table just like that
because I'll be busy.

1649
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:34,538
This is enough for me.

1650
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,418
[wistful music playing]

1651
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:43,296

1653
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:52,973
[phone ringing]

1654
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:55,600
Hello.

1655
01:20:56,059 --> 01:20:57,143
<i>Hi, Choo.</i>

1656
01:20:57,727 --> 01:20:59,521
<i>What's taking you so long to answer?</i>

1657
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:01,773
<i>Are you busy there in Singapore?</i>

1658
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,984
<i>Have you replaced me?</i>

1659
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:05,026
You're crazy.

1660
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:09,698
I'm busy because I'm one of the
youngest animators in Singapore.

1661
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:11,700
<i>Is that so?</i>

1662
01:21:12,617 --> 01:21:13,743
<i>Come home.</i>

1663
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:15,537
The ticket is expensive.

1664
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:19,207
Why?

1665
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:23,670
If I stay longer, will you wait for me?

1666
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,298
It depends.

1667
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:29,551
Why do you say so?

1668
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:32,095
<i>I'm missing you so much.</i>

1669
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:35,557
I'd just go there.

1670
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,403
Do you think I'm meant for Singapore?

1671
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,574
I'm scared that I won't make it.

1672
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:53,533
Choo?

1673
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:55,160
Choo.

1674
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:56,202
Of course--

1675
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:57,787
Of course you can.

1676
01:21:57,871 --> 01:21:59,915
This is all for you.

1677
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,625
You're meant to be here.

1678
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:04,002
I will be your number one supporter.

1679
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:06,546
[Manny] I'll always be rooting for you.

1680
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,427
To be honest, I'm scared.

1681
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:18,099
I don't know if I'll make it without you.

1682
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:28,860
Ayef…

1683
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,450
is it possible to try…

1684
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:38,912
to…

1685
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,791
to cancel our expiration?

1686
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,003
And…

1687
01:22:47,837 --> 01:22:49,714
have a contract extension instead?

1688
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:14,322
Sir, do you have an Ikea family card?

1689
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:15,407
[Manny] Yes, I do.

1690
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:16,741
[cash register beeps]

01:23:17,283 --> 01:23:18,868

[chill music continues]

1694
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:55,488
[Manny] Do you want more?

1695
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,656
I'll pour you some.

1696
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,949
I'm fine.

1697
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:01,036
I don't know if I'm dizzy

1698
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:02,954
or if my eyes are just tired.

1699
01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:06,583
Manny…

1700
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,002
I'm dizzy.

1701
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:12,130
Wait, Choo.

1702
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:21,389
[Ayef groans]

1703
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,516
Hey!

1704
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:26,770
-Ayef. Not in there.
-No.

1705
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:30,482
-What are you doing? Let's go to the sofa.
-I'm okay here.

1706
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,650
Stop it.

1707
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:37,739
-We drank mom's alcoholic drink.
-No!

1708
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:38,948
Ayef, sorry.

1709
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:40,241
[Ayef shushes]

1710
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:42,494
[shushes]

1711
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:44,579
Relax.

1712
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:46,706
[Ayef] Stay here.

1713
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:50,668
[laughing]

1714
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:52,462
[snorting laugh]

1715
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:55,090
If my mom finds out

1716
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:57,550
I'm in a jacuzzi with a boy?

1717
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:02,305
You'll be in trouble.

1718
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,892
She'll pull my hair out for sure.

1719
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:10,772
But how will she do that?

1720
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:13,775
She's not even talking to me.

1721
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:16,945
[laughing]

1722
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:18,988
Ayef…

1723
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,198
Mm?

1724
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:22,867
You're drunk.

1725
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:28,581
[grunts]

1726
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,210
[drunkenly] When…

1727
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:36,798
[Ayef] When I get drunk,

1728
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:39,759
I'm more fearless.

1729
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:44,055
[hiccups]

1730
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:46,558
[Manny laughing]

1731
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:47,642
[Ayef] Why are you laughing?

1732
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:49,435
I'm serious.

1733
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:51,146
I have to tell you something.

1734
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:52,856
Come closer.

1735
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:58,153
I said come closer.

1736
01:25:58,736 --> 01:25:59,904
Come here.

1737
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:06,744
You know what?

1738
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:11,124
Once we're done,

1739
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:13,459
when our contract expires…

1740
01:26:15,086 --> 01:26:16,546
I'll be sad.

1741
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:22,844
I'm happy when I'm with you.

1742
01:26:25,388 --> 01:26:28,391
[Ayef] I wish this night would never end.

1743
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:41,779
[soft music playing]

1744
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:48,244
Careful with your head.

1745
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,872
-[Ayef groans]
-That's it. Just there.

1746
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,386
You know, I was having
the worst day earlier.

1747
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,057
I'm glad you came.

1748
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:14,562
[Manny] Everything feels right
when you're here.

1749
01:27:18,983 --> 01:27:19,734
[exhales deeply]

1750
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:23,112
I also have a secret.

1751
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:27,200
[sniffles]

1752
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:38,253
I have secretly fallen in love with you.

1753
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,968
I…

1754
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,178
love…

1755
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:49,264
you.

1756
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,317
And I am secretly hoping…

1757
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:06,030
that you have fallen in love with me too.

1758
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:38,563
[interviewer] <i>Ms. De Guzman, good day.</i>

1759
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:41,024
<i>We're the panel for the interview today.</i>

1760
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:44,068
<i>Because of your impressive body of work,</i>

1761
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,863
<i>and high recommendation</i>
<i>from your professor…</i>

1762
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:49,365
<i>we scheduled this interview immediately.</i>

1763
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:51,617
<i>Tell us about</i>
<i>this little project of yours.</i>

1764
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:57,498
Okay, ma'am, so the inspiration
behind this project is…

1765
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:59,167
[phone ringing]

1766
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:00,168
<i>Ms. De Guzman?</i>

1767
01:29:00,251 --> 01:29:02,420
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

1768
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:03,880
Yes, ma'am.

1769
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:08,092
As I was saying, the inspiration
behind this project is about--

1770
01:29:09,218 --> 01:29:11,596
[Manny]<i> Sorry, Choo, are you</i>
<i>already in the interview?</i>

1771
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,848
[phone chimes]

1772
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:17,060
<i>Ms. De Guzman, are you still interested</i>
<i>in this opportunity?</i>

1773
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:18,561
[Ayef] Yes, ma'am, of course.

1774
01:29:18,644 --> 01:29:20,980
Ah, I promise, no more distractions.

1775
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:22,774
Just give me this one chance, please.

1776
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:25,193
<i>So now that you're really ready,</i>

1777
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:26,194
<i>focus.</i>

1778
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:27,612
<i>And start now.</i>

1779
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:29,155
Okay, ma'am, thank you.

1780
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:31,032
[exhales deeply]

1781
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,952
Sis, do you have a problem?

1782
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:37,455
[clicks tongue]

1783
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:38,998
Sissy…

1784
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:42,335
I'm done with the Singapore interview.

1785
01:29:42,418 --> 01:29:45,755
-Congrats!
-[cheering]

1786
01:29:45,838 --> 01:29:47,215
So proud of you.

1787
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:49,342
But I don't know what to do.

1788
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:51,427
Huh? You don't know what to do?

1789
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,181
[Jobert] I know this look.

1790
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:57,266
Manny.

1791
01:29:57,350 --> 01:30:00,645
I don't know how to finish
what we've started.

1792
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:03,022
You have an expiration date.

1793
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,816
[Jobert] You will fulfill your dreams.

1794
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:06,692
That's your priority.

1795
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:09,320
Guys, it's 2022.

1796
01:30:09,403 --> 01:30:12,740
Everything can work.
Why don't you and Manny try an LDR?

1797
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,408
You'll be in Singapore
and he'll be in Manila.

1798
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:16,702
If they go long-distance,
Ayef's effort and energy

1799
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:19,664
for her work and her dreams

1800
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:22,333
will be divided.

1801
01:30:22,416 --> 01:30:23,459
Inconvenient!

1802
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:26,504
We don't live in a convenience store.

1803
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:27,672
Love.

1804
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:29,048
Love can conquer everything.

1805
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:30,007
-Love?
-Love!

1806
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,551
-Are you sure about love?
-Love!

1807
01:30:31,634 --> 01:30:33,261
Let me just remind you,

1808
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,054
Anastacia Filemona De Guzman,

1809
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:38,057
that the last time you fell in love,

1810
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:40,309
you almost lost everything.

1811
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:42,979
You adjusted your life

1812
01:30:43,062 --> 01:30:44,897
for nothing.

1813
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:47,984
Sis, you're not the same girl.

1814
01:30:48,067 --> 01:30:49,819
You're now a smart girl.

1815
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:51,654
Lessons should be learned.

1816
01:30:51,737 --> 01:30:53,614
[Kookie] Exactly.

1817
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:56,617
She's smart. That's why she loves Manny.

1818
01:30:57,118 --> 01:31:01,622
Do you really believe
Kookie's love advice?

1819
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:04,667
She can't even break up
with her abusive boyfriend.

1820
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:06,252
-Don't be like that.
-[Jobert] Why?

1821
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:08,546
Jobert, you're crossing the line.

1822
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:11,591
I'm just stating facts.
Stop encouraging her.

1823
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:14,051
[Kookie] Because Manny is worth it.

1824
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:15,720
[Jobert] Is he really?

1825
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,639
[crickets chirping]

1826
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:23,102
Are you okay?

1827
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:24,103
Let's go.

1828
01:31:24,937 --> 01:31:26,856
[Dobs] They're here.

1829
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,816
-[Dobs] Manny!
-[Ayef] Happy birthday.

1830
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,526
Oy, oy, oy,

1831
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:31,777
Happy birthday, Dobs.

1832
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,154
Here's our gift.

1833
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:34,238
[Dobs] Thank you, Ayef.

1834
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:35,406
Choo,

1835
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:37,283
meet my family.

1836
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:38,951
Welcome.

1837
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:40,286
Please, join us.

1838
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:42,038
[Wilfredo] Enjoy the food.

1839
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:43,414
Thank you.

1840
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:47,919
[Wilfredo] Ayef.

1841
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:50,671
I'd like to get to know you more.

1842
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:53,090
How did the two of you meet?

1843
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:54,383
Come on, tell us.

1844
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:59,680
Actually, it was
totally unexpected because

1845
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:01,933
we met at a rally.

1846
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:03,434
And then--

1847
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:05,978
[Wilfredo] Rally?

1848
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:07,146
-[Wilfredo] The one…
-Ah…

1849
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,106
…against Siena Corp?

1850
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,817
-[Manny] Dad, it's…
-[Wilfredo] It's interesting.

1851
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:14,695
You've got quite a beautiful love story.

1852
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,031
Love story? [chuckles]

1853
01:32:17,114 --> 01:32:18,532
Whose love story?

1854
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:20,034
Ma?

1855
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:23,287
[Meryl] Interesting.
Who prepared all this?

1856
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:24,455
I did.

1857
01:32:24,538 --> 01:32:25,915
Oh.

1858
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:27,416
-Ma.
-Mm?

1859
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,211
I'm just having fun, come on.
This is your birthday.

1860
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:32,421
-Happy birthday, darling.
-Thank you, Mom.

1861
01:32:33,422 --> 01:32:34,298
[Meryl] Oh.

1862
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:37,134
And you are?

1863
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:38,970
Ayef, ma'am.

1864
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:40,137
Ayef.

1865
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,014
If you arrived on time,

1866
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:44,600
you wouldn't even have to ask her that.

1867
01:32:44,684 --> 01:32:47,395
Is that a good evening

1868
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:51,357
from my cheating ex-husband?

1869
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,733
[Viviana] Mom?

1870
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,151
We have guests. [nervous chuckle]

1871
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:55,027
[Meryl] Come on.

1872
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:58,406
If Ayef is going to be part of the family,

1873
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:04,996
I think it's best that she knows
the true colors of our family.

1874
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:07,665
Yes? All right, I'll tell you.

1875
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:11,002
So that you won't be confused
the whole night.

1876
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:12,753
Let's just say,

1877
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:14,672
I am Eve.

1878
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:15,506
Okay?

1879
01:33:15,589 --> 01:33:18,634
And that man is Adam.

1880
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:22,305
The woman, she is the snake.

1881
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:25,266
And the boy next to her…

1882
01:33:25,349 --> 01:33:28,686
That is the forbidden fruit.

1883
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:31,314
Poison. [laughs]

1884
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:32,898
[Wilfredo] Shut up, Meryl!

1885
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:34,775
What? I'm just telling the story
of your love affair

1886
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:36,360
in the most creative way.

1887
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:40,656
People love mistress stories.

1888
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,700
-Do you agree with me, Agnes?
-[Wilfredo bangs table]

1889
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:46,245
You come here, you mess up
everybody's evening…

1890
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:48,748
You know what? You're really crazy.

1891
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:50,499
I'm crazy? I don't think so.

1892
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:53,127
-Do you want me to tell you who's crazy?
-Ma, I want cake, Mama.

1893
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:55,463
See? Do you want me
to tell you who's crazy?

1894
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:56,839
I can tell you straight away.

1895
01:33:56,922 --> 01:33:58,591
Actually, I don't even have to say a word.

1896
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:00,551
[Wilfredo] That's my cue.

1897
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:03,554
I'll just see you
at the office tomorrow, Manny.

1898
01:34:03,637 --> 01:34:04,472
What?

1899
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:06,223
At the office?!
What, you work for your father now?

1900
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:07,224
[Wilfredo] He will.

1901
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:08,267
-Dad?
-[Meryl] What?

1902
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:10,311
This is not an option.

1903
01:34:10,394 --> 01:34:12,271
This is my command.

1904
01:34:12,355 --> 01:34:14,440
And you grow up, young man.

1905
01:34:14,523 --> 01:34:18,778
Stop fighting the business that feeds you.

1906
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:22,114
[Wilfredo] And stop insisting
on enrolling your brother.

1907
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:24,075
You're just wasting my money.

1908
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:26,035
No ifs! No buts!

1909
01:34:26,118 --> 01:34:29,914
And you shut down that
plant shop of yours immediately.

1910
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:31,123
Is that what you want Manny?

1911
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:33,626
[Meryl] Manny?

1912
01:34:33,709 --> 01:34:35,336
Manny, is that what you want?

1913
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:37,254
[Wilfredo] And finally,

1914
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:40,466
stop meeting up with people
who are not good for you.

1915
01:34:40,549 --> 01:34:43,761
[Meryl] No, you do not tell him
who to see and who he cannot see!

1916
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:45,262
[Wilfredo] Yes, he will!

1917
01:34:46,263 --> 01:34:47,807
Manny, come on!

1918
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:49,934
[Viviana] Mom, Dad, please stop it!

1919
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:53,187
Can't you just please, for once?
It's Manny's birthday.

1920
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:56,482
[Meryl] Well, Manny, happy birthday.
And everybody, I'm done here.

1921
01:34:56,565 --> 01:34:57,566
[Wilfredo] Well, go!

1922
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,985
-No one wants you here anyway.
-[Viviana] Stop it, everyone!

1923
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:01,028
[door closes]

1924
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:07,326
[Ayef hissing softly]

1925
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:08,828
Wait, Manny.

1926
01:35:08,911 --> 01:35:10,579
Manny, it hurts.

1927
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:11,831
Sorry.

1928
01:35:13,165 --> 01:35:14,959
I just want to get out of here.

1929
01:35:16,168 --> 01:35:17,461
Where do you want to go?

1930
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,088
Just tell me.

1931
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:21,006
Anywhere. Let's go.

1932
01:35:21,715 --> 01:35:22,633
Manny…

1933
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:29,390
Choo, I'm sorry about tonight, okay?

1934
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:31,267
I'm sorry about Dad.

1935
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:32,518
Don't mind him, okay?

1936
01:35:32,601 --> 01:35:33,811
You're good for me.

1937
01:35:47,741 --> 01:35:49,535
Do you want to say something?

1938
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,371
[Ayef sighs]

1939
01:35:54,039 --> 01:35:55,291
Sorry.

1940
01:35:55,374 --> 01:35:56,375
[sniffles]

1941
01:35:58,294 --> 01:35:59,712
I want to breathe.

1942
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:05,885
I need space.

1943
01:36:05,968 --> 01:36:07,094
Wait.

1944
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:09,305
I'm confused.

1945
01:36:12,808 --> 01:36:13,934
So am I.

1946
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:15,811
Confused. Afraid.

1947
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:18,564
I thought…

1948
01:36:18,647 --> 01:36:22,610
Ayef, I understand tonight was upsetting.

1949
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:25,488
It really was, okay?

1950
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:26,739
Even for me.

1951
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:28,824
I'm here.

1952
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:32,786
I'm here whenever you need me, okay?

1953
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:37,750
[sniffles] Sorry.

1954
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:39,835
Sorry, Manny.

1955
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:43,214
[sobs softly]

1956
01:36:43,714 --> 01:36:45,382
I'm scared.

1957
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:48,594
Ayef…

1958
01:36:54,517 --> 01:36:57,144
There are so many questions in my head.

1959
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,732
If he can't fight for himself,

1960
01:37:05,402 --> 01:37:08,197
how can he fight for us?

1961
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:11,700
What will happen when I leave?

1962
01:37:12,701 --> 01:37:16,789
What if things get worse?

1963
01:37:21,418 --> 01:37:25,047
[sniffles] I am almost willing
to give up everything.

1964
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:29,009
Everything. Just to be with you.

1965
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,764
So I can stay here with you.

1966
01:37:35,057 --> 01:37:37,184
I'll forget Singapore.

1967
01:37:39,895 --> 01:37:42,856
Because in the end, everything
will be worth it, right?

1968
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:47,236
But I'm not worth it?

1969
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:58,038
[Ayef] I can't.

1970
01:37:58,581 --> 01:37:59,582
[sniffles]

1971
01:38:00,332 --> 01:38:03,586
I don't want us to be like my parents.

1972
01:38:05,879 --> 01:38:07,923
I don't want us to fight every day.

1973
01:38:10,759 --> 01:38:13,429
I don't want to lose
my respect for you, Manny.

1974
01:38:15,472 --> 01:38:18,017
I don't want the time to come

1975
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:23,647
that we regret we chose each other.

1976
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:28,485
I'm scared.

1977
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:33,407
Because I don't know how to love

1978
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:35,618
without hurting each other.

1979
01:38:38,454 --> 01:38:40,164
Just tell me I'm not worth it.

1980
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:44,710
And that you want a way out
of this relationship.

1981
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:50,591
We agreed to this relationship
with eyes wide open.

1982
01:38:50,674 --> 01:38:53,385
That if this becomes an inconvenience,

1983
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:54,678
we'll break up.

1984
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:56,180
Manny, you agreed to that, right?

1985
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:57,723
Because I want to be with you.

1986
01:38:58,807 --> 01:39:00,601
I want to be with you.

1987
01:39:02,686 --> 01:39:03,646
And now what?

1988
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:06,315
I'm an inconvenience to you--

1989
01:39:06,398 --> 01:39:08,150
Because I love you, Manny.

1990
01:39:08,233 --> 01:39:09,735
I love you!

1991
01:39:11,987 --> 01:39:13,989
You only love me when we're happy.

1992
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,033
Manny…

1993
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:18,160
You only want me when everything is okay.

1994
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,205
