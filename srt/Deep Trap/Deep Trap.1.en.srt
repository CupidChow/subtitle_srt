00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,416
For men, 90% of it is due to stress.

4
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,125
A miscarriage isn't the only reason.

5
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:44,500
It'll improve once he knows
it isn't a physical dysfunction.

6
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,791
Really?

7
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:49,916
Try not to push him. It can be stressful.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,666
Stimulation and mood, all right?

9
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,333
Okay.

14
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,125
Thank you.

15

Thank you.

16
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,416
Thank you, man.

17
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,208
- Hey, newlywed.
- Yeah.

18
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,833
- How often do you do it?
- What?

19
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,666
Enjoy it while you're young.

20
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,208
Soon, you'll be a family
instead of a couple.

21
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,500
With two kids, we can't make time for it.

22
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,500
I've forgotten how to do it.

00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,083
This might be my story.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,083
I cry over TV shows these days.

27
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,916
Poor you.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,750
You ran out of hormones.

29
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,166
Hey.

30
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,916
Let go of me.

31
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:35,625
I like my wife very much.

32
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,416
I love her very much.

33
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,375
One more drink!

34
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,833
It's on me!

35
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,583
Hey, don't go!

36
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,125

00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,250
Honey.

42
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,500
Your favorite ice cream.

43
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,208
You're late.

44
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,750
It was hard to say no to the boss.

45
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,125
He insisted on drinking.

46
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,208
Why didn't you answer your cell phone?

47
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,125
Honey, I'm sorry.

48
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,458
Take a shower. Then, we should talk.

49
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,125
I'm sorry.

50
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,000
Shall we...

51
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,791
go on a trip?

52
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:39,041
DEEP TRAP

53
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,333
Are we there yet?

54
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,208
Soon.

55
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Are you sure it's okay
to take the day off?

56
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,333
Maybe not.

57
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,875
But what can I do?

58
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,958
Quit my job?

59
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,041
Feels good to be out in fresh air.

60
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,125
We should have gone to Jeju.

61
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,500
What's famous here?

62
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,666
What?

63
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,083
Oh... This and that.

64
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,291
Is that the island?

65
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,875
Wow, it's in the middle of nowhere.

66
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,833
How did you find this place?

67
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,958
On the Internet.

68
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,583
This restaurant's too far.
Did you make a reservation?

69
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,666
Huh?

70
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,500
Sure.

71
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,333
Hey.

72
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,750
Look.

73
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,000
There's nothing here.

74
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:32,416
Strange. Maybe the road got reconstructed.

75
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,250
Call them.

76
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,208
Okay.

77
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,833
- No signal.
- What are you talking about?

78
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,541
What was that?

79
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,250
- Hit the gas!
- I'm doing it.

80
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,625
It's so different from what I heard.

81
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,541
Can't see the ocean from here.

82
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,708
Let's go in. We've come a long way.

83
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,791
What's that sound?

84
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,791
Is this Sanmaru Restaurant?

85
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,291
Can we order something?

86
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,875
What's good on the menu?

87
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,958
This is a weird place. Let's leave.

88
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,083
But you took me here.

89
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,583
Our chicken soup is great.

90
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,625
You can pick a chicken yourself.

91
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,958
We'll order that.

92
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,291
That's really unique.

93
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,208
Hey.

94
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,958
What the hell are you doing?
Go pour them some water.

95
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:26,916
You idiot.

96
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,083
Water first.

97
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,083
Bitch.

98
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:49,333
We pasture the chickens
and only feed them snakes and worms.

99
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,666
The meat is amazing.

100
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,000
Here you go.

101
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,291
It's so tender!

102
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,041
It's good for men.

103
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,708
- I'd like some booze, please.
- Booze?

104
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,541
I'll give you a good one.

105
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,541
Hey, go fetch my booze.

106
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:37,583
Booze is supposed to be kept in pots.

107
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,041
What booze is this?

108
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,916
This...

109
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,916
It's not just any booze.

110
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,416
Drink up.

111
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,291
- You, too.
- No, thanks.

112
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,041
It's really good.

113
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,000
Take a glass.

114
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,750
Good idea.

115
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:08,791
Hey, he's very handsome.

116
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,416
Boyfriend?

117
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,666
Husband. It's been five years.

118
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,166
What about kids?

119
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,750
Not yet.

120
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,208
You've come to the right place.

121
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,916
Drink up. I should go now.

122
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:33,083
It's really good booze. Help yourself.

123
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,791
Hey, I'm going to the mountain.

124
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,833
Do it right!

125
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,541
Serve them well.

126
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,250
- Have a good time.
- Thanks.

127
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,750
- Empty?
- Yes, it is.

128
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,291
Wow, fresh air.

129
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,166
Sorry I was so grumpy.

130
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,708
It's been years since our last trip.

131
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,791
We've had some hard times.

132
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,791
What about now?

133
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,000
You're still in pain.

134
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:17,041
Come to think of it,
I haven't been a good husband.

135
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Sorry. I've been selfish.

136
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,750
It's okay.

137
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,916
We still have each other.

138
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,291
I...

139
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,041
I don't need a baby.

140
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,625
So-yeon.

141
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,000
That's a magic baby-maker.

142
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,791
Badger, elk,

143
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,625
and viper snake.

144
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,541
These are magic baby-makers.

145
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,916
Just sex isn't enough. You need these.

146
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,666
Hey, set the table.

147
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,000
What the hell are you waiting for?

148
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:19,791
Don't drink that cheap stuff.
She'll bring a good one.

149
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,416
It's not centipede wine, is it?

150
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,625
No, much better.

151
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,375
Here, drink this.

152
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,583
You don't know anything.

153
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,291
Hey, bro.

154
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,208
Did you say
you're five years older than me?

155
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,291
Yeah. We're bros now?

156
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,666
Can I call you Joon-sik?

157
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,208
- Sure.
- Okay, Joon-sik.

158
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,625
- Let me fill your glass.
- Thanks.

159
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,833
Thanks.

160
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,333
- You're a good drinker.
- I like drinking.

161
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,916
Why don't you have a drink?

162
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
No, thanks.

163
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:06,291
It's really precious booze.
Good for women also.

164
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,083
Come closer.

165
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,750
Fill up the glasses, you moron.

166
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,541
Thanks.

167
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,041
Snake wine.

168
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:45,375
You're not supposed
to make it in glass jars.

169
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:49,541
It should be made with live snakes.

170
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,000
This is the real deal.

171
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,833
These can even give
90-year-old grandpas erections.

172
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,583
Get it?

173
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,500
Can she pour me a drink?

174
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,416
Sure, go ahead.

175
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,583
Oh,

176
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,375
thank you.

177
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,041
You don't talk much.

178
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,333
She can't speak.

179
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,416
Well,

180
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,708
let me give you a drink.

181
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,666
Don't touch it! You'll get hurt.

182
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,500
Don't touch it.

183
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,416
That was a nice sound, huh?

184
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,000
Don't we have to talk?

185
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,333
I know we do.

186
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,541
Honey, let's leave now.

187
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:00,291
Why? I like it here.

188
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,166
You're too drunk. I'll drive.

189
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,958
All right, then.

190
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,500
No drunk driving.

191
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,125
There are no street lights around here.
It's too dangerous.

192
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:24,750
Spend the night here
and leave tomorrow morning.

193
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:31,625
You're letting us sleep here?

194
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,958
We owe you big time.

195
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,458
Don't worry about it.

196
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,625
You have a beautiful wife.

197
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,000
You think?

198
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,583
You want to do her?

199
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,583
That idiot.

200
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:08,000
I raised her since she was young,
that ungrateful bitch.

201
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:11,458
She was such a whiner and tried to escape,

202
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,000
so I cut out her tongue.

203
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,041
It's a joke!

204
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,500
God.

205
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:34,541
She was an orphan so I helped her.

206
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,333
Right, Min-hee?

207
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:38,791
See?

208
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,291
God, your faces.

209
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,375
- You scared me.
- Eat up.

210
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:51,041
It's good. Fertilized egg.

211
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:53,708
Try it.

212
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:03,083
12:49 AM
Saturday, Sep. 20th

213
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,041
Honey.

214
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,125
Where are you?

215
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,833
Joon-sik?

216
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,541
Joon-sik?

217
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,416
Do you know where my husband went?

218
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,291
To the mountain?

219
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,625
Do you need help?

220
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,375
You're hurt.

221
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,166
It might leave a scar.

222
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,500
Done.

223
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,500
Your name's Min-hee?

224
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:28,041
How long have you lived here?

225
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,000
Don't you feel lonely?

226
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,958
Hold this.

227
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:22,958
Drink up.

228
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:24,833
Drink up.

229
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,250
You want a baby? Drink.

230
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,750
Drink up.

231
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,166
Good job.

232
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:06,291
Bro, why do you leave so much behind?

233
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:10,791
I only take the healthy parts.

234
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:18,208
Hey.

235
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:22,083
Why haven't you had kids these five years?

236
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:23,541
You can't do it?

237
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:25,833
What?

238
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,000
Can't get a boner?

239
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,333
Well...

240
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:38,791
I love her very much,
but seems like that's not enough.

241
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:40,875
It's difficult.

242
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:45,875
When did it start? Did something happen?

243
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,375
How about with other women?

244
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,625
Haven't even thought of it.

245
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:00,958
You need to treat it.

246
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,583
Stay a bit longer. I think I can fix you.

247
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:07,666
Let's go.

248
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,250
- Bring the gun.
- Okay.

249
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:46,666
Where were you? I was worried.

250
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,750
Sorry, we went hunting.

251
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,708
You should have told me.

252
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,166
I didn't want to wake you up.

253
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,666
Let's go home now.

254
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:00,500
We had a good time, bro.

255
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:04,458
- You should stay.
- I have to go to work.

256
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:06,708
Here, take some fresh chestnuts.

257
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:09,291
- Be careful.
- Take care.

258
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:10,375
You too.

259
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,208
That's weird.

260
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:27,416
What's wrong?

261
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,666
The fuse is out.

262
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,833
- Fuse?
- Yes.

263
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:45,291
We have a broken car. Can you come now?

264
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:49,208
Then, when?

265
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:54,708
All right, then. I get it.

266
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:02,250
The repairman says he can come tomorrow.

267
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,333
So, spend another night here.

268
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:08,708
Leave tomorrow morning.

269
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:13,375
You're doing us a great favor.

270
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:17,791
Don't worry about it.
There's no motel around here anyway.

271
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,416
Hey, bring that.

272
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,875
- I'll do it.
- It's okay.

273
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:33,916
Help yourself.

274
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,750
Eat it with salt.

275
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,583
This smells amazing.

276
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:43,333
The meat is so juicy.

277
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,916
By the way,

278
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,958
is it okay to hunt like this?

279
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:54,333
Isn't the mountain considered
a wildlife sanctuary?

280
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,541
This whole island is mine.

281
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,583
I decide what to do. Sue me.

282
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:07,041
Sue you? I'm your accomplice now.

283
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:13,083
I don't serve these to just anybody.

284
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,375
I like you, bro.

285
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,416
You're my special guest.

286
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:22,166
You know, in Mongolia,

287
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:26,083
they even offer their own wives

288
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:28,416
to very special guests.

289
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,541
For a night.

290
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:32,958
I don't disagree with them.

291
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,625
Come over here.

292
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,041
How do you like her?

293
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:41,875
She's quite pretty, don't you think?

294
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:49,083
It would be rude if she was ugly, yeah?

295
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:53,791
Have a drink.

296
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:57,000
Did I say something awkward?

297
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,041
Help yourself.

298
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,625
Let me go to the restroom.

299
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,541
- I'll go with you.
- You, too?

300
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,458
Enjoy yourself.

301
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,416
How's the booze?

302
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:32,583
Nice and strong.

303
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:36,416
And about your problem...
Try not to care too much.

304
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,291
Come by at midnight.

305
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,916
I'll leave you two alone.

306
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,583
She's not my wife. She's my sister.

307
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,875
It's really fine with me.

308
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:51,750
It might cure your problem.

309
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:57,041
Don't say no. Think about it.

310
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,708
And stay a little longer! I can fix you.

311
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:08,375
It's raining. It rains everyday...

312
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,083
Let's get inside.

313
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,541
Get inside.

314
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:17,291
Just take the booze bottle.

315
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:27,583
Go in, Joon-sik. Let's drink more inside.

316
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,000
Take a seat.

317
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,958
You, set the table.

318
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:37,125
Take a seat. Let's drink more.

319
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:40,291
The weather goes back and forth.

320
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,083
Do you want it to work or not?

321
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,333
Come in!

322
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:31,833
I'm really tired. I'll go to sleep first.

323
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,541
Good night.

324
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,125
She looks tired.

325
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:41,833
Bro, I'll go with her.

326
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:45,500
- Have another drink.
- I'm tired, too.

327
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,750
Let's have one more drink.

328
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:02,041
Are you asleep?

329
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:03,666
Why?

330
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,875
Bro, are you asleep?

331
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,625
We're not done.

332
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:22,833
Let's have another drink.

333
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:26,916
Sorry, but I've had enough.

334
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,250
Think about it.

335
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:34,208
He really doesn't understand boundaries.

336
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:43,166
It's fine with me. Go ahead.

337
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,125
No, I'll just sleep.

338
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:47,083
Hey.

339
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,166
No, I'm...

340
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,875
Just one more drink.

341
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,875
It's okay.

342
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,125
Take a seat.

343
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:03,458
Make yourself at home.

344
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:07,291
Have a drink.

345
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,291
I'll be at the garage.

346
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:11,875
It's okay.

347
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:42,250
I'm sorry.

348
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,833
Scream.

349
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:47,416
It'll be fun.

350
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:37,833
Good morning.

351
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:39,958
Bro!

352
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:44,416
Joon-sik, wake up. It's almost noon.

353
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:56,458
Asshole.

354
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:05,666
Where are you? You said you'll open today.

355
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:11,083
What the hell? Then, when are you coming?

356
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,291
Okay.

357
00:53:16,416 --> 00:53:18,125
Shit.

358
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:23,375
That asshole... He's coming late at night.

359
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:27,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,333
Let me check if there's a back door.

361
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,458
Okay.

362
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,666
My car broke down.

363
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:46,250
I'll come to work tomorrow.

364
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:51,708
Tell the boss, would you?

365
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:55,500
Thanks. All right.

366
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:16,833
Son of a bitch.

367
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:21,916
Arsonist.

368
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:26,916
Hey, what do you mean?

369
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:30,250
What are you doing?

370
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:32,791
Nothing.

371
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:35,416
You son of a bitch!

372
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:55,416
Couldn't find a way in.

373
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:29,833
That old man...

374
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:34,291
What did he say?

375
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,750
Something about an arsonist.

376
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:44,416
A long time ago,

377
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:49,083
when my mom died,
my alcoholic dad used to beat me.

378
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:55,041
He brought my stepmom with him
and that bitch beat me, too.

379
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:59,958
She tried to abandon me.

380
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:06,291
So I set fire to the house
while everyone was asleep.

381
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:19,541
<i>I did it out of anger.
Didn't know they'd die.</i>

382
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:26,000
That crazy old man doesn't know anything.

383
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,458
Sorry, don't worry about it.

384
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:04,041
I have to check the snare
to see if I caught anything.

385
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,333
Come with me.

386
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:30,458
I have to reset this.

387
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:34,833
You go check the other one.

388
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,916
Hurry up.

389
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:45,875
Here?

390
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,333
On your right.

391
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:50,166
Yeah. That's right.

392
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:55,041
Help!

393
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:57,458
Bro!

394
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:44,583
Is this the restaurant?

395
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:46,833
Yes, I heard the chicken soup is amazing.

396
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:50,208
Is this Sanmaru Restaurant?

397
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,916
Yes.

398
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,291
Can we order something?

399
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:56,750
Wow, how did you find this place?

400
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,375
People say there are tons
of fun things to do here.

401
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:23,750
Where is my husband?

402
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:26,250
Go serve the guests.

403
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,666
You took him with you!

404
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:31,333
He'll come back with the repair guy.

405
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,666
Serve them some water.

406
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,791
Hey!

407
00:59:36,875 --> 00:59:37,875
You bitch.

408
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:44,333
- Welcome. You came from Seoul, right?
- Yes.

409
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:47,416
Our chicken soup is great.

410
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,833
You can pick a chicken yourself.

411
00:59:50,375 --> 00:59:53,791
- That will be fun.
- You think so?

412
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:56,583
Hey, stay here.

413
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:58,708
You'll miss him if you go.

414
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:05,458
Excuse me.

415
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,708
- Let me fill your glass.
- Thank you.

416
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:41,041
I said stay.

417
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,291
Come sit there.

418
01:00:50,166 --> 01:00:51,500
Let go of me!

419
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:24,708
Honey?

420
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:33,708
- Who is it?
- Open the door.

421
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:37,583
Why are you doing this?
Where's my husband?

422
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:39,250
I said, open the door.

423
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:41,416
Before I break it open.

424
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:43,458
One.

425
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:45,208
Two.

426
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:50,166
Your honey's right here.

427
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:53,875
Hey.

428
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,750
You're embarrassing me
in front of the guests.

429
01:01:57,833 --> 01:02:00,875
Don't you get on my nerves.

430
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:04,416
Shit.

431
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:53,041
Why aren't you undressed yet?

432
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:58,125
Take it off.

433
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,166
I'll do it myself.

434
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,666
Wait.

435
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,083
Wait!

436
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:07,500
Lie down. It's okay.

437
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:29,416
Wait.

438
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,125
Wait for what?

439
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:35,000
Wait!

440
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:37,083
You came to me yourself, bitch.

441
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:40,833
Let me go! I said, wait.

442
01:03:40,916 --> 01:03:43,333
I don't want it! I'm leaving.

443
01:03:43,416 --> 01:03:44,583
Honey!

444
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:50,041
Honey!

445
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:54,125
Su-jeong...

446
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:55,750
Honey!

447
01:04:00,916 --> 01:04:02,666
You're leaving?

448
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,083
Bitch.

449
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,083
You're leaving?

450
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:15,333
You're leaving?

451
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:17,958
What are you doing?

452
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:20,333
You motherfucker!

453
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:23,333
Su-jeong.

454
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:27,791
You asshole!

455
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:37,125
Don't piss me off.

456
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:41,083
Annoying assholes.

457
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:44,166
You two leave together...

458
01:04:45,666 --> 01:04:47,250
Get your hands off me, bitch.

459
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:04,583
Shit.

460
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:08,541
Clean up, moron.

461
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:34,291
What's taking you so long?

462
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:53,375
Bro, what happened?
I looked all over for you.

463
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:56,166
Where were you?

464
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:00,958
What happened to your face?

465
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,833
Come inside.

466
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:08,750
Where have you been?
Your wife is waiting. Come on.

467
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:27,791
Your husband's here.

468
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:29,000
Come in.

469
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,416
Let's leave this place.

470
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,791
Who is it?

471
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:39,416
It's me, bro.

472
01:07:40,666 --> 01:07:42,416
Just a sec.

473
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:01,666
You need something?

474
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:05,833
- A towel.
- Sure.

475
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:19,041
Hurry up, moron.

476
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:45,291
It's okay.

477
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:03,041
I'll be back soon.

478
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,166
Help...

479
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:30,208
Help me.

480
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:29,166
So-yeon...

481
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:32,416
So-yeon!

482
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:41,541
Bro, are you there?

483
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,333
Where are you?

484
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:52,500
Son of a bitch.

485
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,791
That crazy bastard.

486
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:11,833
Let's go to the police station.

487
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:17,666
I'm sorry. I really didn't know.

488
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:22,125
It was me.

489
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,000
What are you talking about?

490
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:40,666
It was me. I arranged it all.

491
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:44,416
Last night was my plan.

492
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:51,166
So you know I slept with her?

493
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,541
I'm sorry.

494
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:55,833
I'm so sorry.

495
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:41,041
Joon-sik...

496
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:44,875
Joon-sik...

497
01:15:50,041 --> 01:15:51,875
Joon-sik...

498
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:13,750
Are you okay?

499
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,541
- So-yeon...
- I'm sorry.

500
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:22,208
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

501
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:32,083
I thought this place might cure you.

502
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:44,291
<i>Bring your husband here. I can fix him.</i>

503
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:49,166
I'm home.

504
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:54,166
I was afraid you might give up.

505
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:00,500
I was hoping...

506
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:08,500
we would go back to our happy days.

507
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:13,083
I wanted to be happy again.

508
01:17:24,416 --> 01:17:25,458
I'm sorry, So-yeon.

509
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,875
I've hurt you.

510
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,458
It's my fault.

511
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:47,333
Shut up. You're annoying me.

512
01:17:48,666 --> 01:17:51,083
What the fuck are you doing?

513
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:56,916
You don't like it here?

514
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,333
I was good to you.

515
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:01,291
Why are you trying to leave?

516
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:10,416
I told you what happened
when someone tried to abandon me.

517
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,166
Don't you remember?

518
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,750
I don't get it.

519
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:22,083
Don't! Please don't!

520
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:27,125
What are you doing there?

521
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:29,583
Bitch.

522
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:33,000
Fetch a basin for his blood.

523
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:37,000
Why are you doing this to us?

524
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:39,750
Please don't!

525
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:43,208
Bitch, you brought him here yourself.

526
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:45,125
So your business is done?

527
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:49,416
Your business might be done,
but my business isn't.

528
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:55,666
You want to go?

529
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:57,625
You guys are so annoying.

530
01:18:57,708 --> 01:19:00,166
If you want to go,
I won't be nice anymore.

531
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,500
Fuck.

532
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:11,875
Don't annoy me.

533
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:14,875
You're the fucking same!

534
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:20,708
That's why you'll be dead.

535
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:25,416
Don't move. This will take longer.

536
01:19:26,666 --> 01:19:27,666
Park!

537
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,083
Are you inside?

538
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,041
Look at that chicken.

539
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:00,666
What brought you here, bro?

540
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:06,791
A couple from Seoul has gone missing.

541
01:20:06,875 --> 01:20:11,000
Why did they have to go missing
in my jurisdiction?

542
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,500
This couple. Do you recognize them?

543
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:20,750
I've never seen them.

544
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:23,166
Man-sik says he saw them.

545
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:27,083
Well, visitors come and go.

546
01:20:27,166 --> 01:20:28,166
Right?

547
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:34,208
Hey, drop by sometime
and have chicken soup.

548
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:37,583
- All right. I will.
- All right.

549
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,583
Your chickens look nice and chubby.

550
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:41,750
Bye.

551
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:45,083
- Call us if you see them.
- Okay, bye.

552
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:53,208
You should come with him.
I have good booze.

553
01:20:53,291 --> 01:20:54,291
Sure.

554
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:07,333
What's wrong?

555
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:10,208
Must be the goats.

556
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:13,916
Why would you keep them inside?

557
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:18,375
- It's the goats.
- Let me check.

558
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,916
It's my property, damn it.

559
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:28,750
Just checking.

560
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:40,833
What the...

561
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:05,958
You! What the...

562
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:25,166
Hey, what...

563
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:28,250
What is going on?

564
01:22:31,666 --> 01:22:34,666
Murder at Sanmaru Restaurant!

565
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:29,083
What the hell?

566
01:23:33,583 --> 01:23:34,875
You crazy bitch!

567
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:38,375
Where did they go?

568
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:39,916
You're nuts.

569
01:23:42,625 --> 01:23:44,708
Are you crazy? Get your hands off me.

570
01:23:44,791 --> 01:23:47,708
Fuck off, moron.

571
01:23:47,791 --> 01:23:51,583
All right, Min-hee. Let me deal with them.

572
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:53,125
Let me go.

573
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:56,541
Fuck off, you bitch!

574
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:03,291
Shit.

575
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:48,041
Are you okay?

576
01:24:52,291 --> 01:24:53,291
Oh, no.

577
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:56,958
Where are you, bro?

578
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:01,541
So-yeon?

579
01:26:01,625 --> 01:26:04,000
You guys are annoying me again.

580
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:07,875
Don't try too hard.

581
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:10,916
No one has ever escaped.

582
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:18,000
So-yeon, did you tell him?

583
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:22,958
I was very gentle to you.

584
01:26:29,416 --> 01:26:30,708
Yes or no?

585
01:26:40,458 --> 01:26:41,833
Where's Joon-sik?

586
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:56,791
Die! Go to hell!

587
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:22,541
Joon-sik!

588
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:24,833
Son of a bitch.

589
01:27:27,541 --> 01:27:33,041
So, you can do anyone but your own wife?

590
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:39,958
While you were doing Min-hee,
I was with your wife.

591
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:42,958
You didn't notice, idiot?

592
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:44,750
Son of a bitch!

593
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:47,166
Just die. You're tiring me out.

594
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,541
No! Please, no!

595
01:27:54,625 --> 01:27:56,916
Please...

596
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,625
Please don't kill him.

597
01:27:58,708 --> 01:28:00,125
Let him go.

598
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:01,875
It's all my fault.

599
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:03,166
Don't kill him.

600
01:28:03,916 --> 01:28:05,250
I'll do whatever you say.

601
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:08,791
I'll stay as long as you want.
Please don't kill him.

602
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:11,041
I'm damn sure you would.

603
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:27,041
I was good to you, bitch.

604
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:30,833
Trying to play with me?

605
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:34,541
This is my island.

606
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:38,208
You should also die.

607
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:45,125
What's wrong with you?

608
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:47,375
Go wait at home!

609
01:29:04,166 --> 01:29:05,041
So-yeon!

610
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:06,708
That crazy bitch.

611
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:47,333
Honey!

612
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:03,500
Honey, are you all right?
