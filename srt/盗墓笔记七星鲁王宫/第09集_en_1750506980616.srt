00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I'm not a good singer.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm not a good singer.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm not a good singer.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm not a good singer.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not a good singer.

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not a good singer.

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm not a good singer.

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm not a good singer.

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm not a good singer.

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not a good singer.

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm not a good singer.

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm not a good singer.

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm not a good singer.

14
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not a good singer.

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not a good singer.

16
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm not a good singer.

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm not a good singer.

18
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not a good singer.

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm not a good singer.

20
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not a good singer.

I'm not a good singer.

26
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm not a good singer.

27
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm not a good singer.

28
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm not a good singer.

29
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not a good singer.

30
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm not a good singer.

31
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not a good singer.

32
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm not a good singer.

33
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not a good singer.

34
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not a good singer.

35
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not a good singer.

36
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm not a good singer.

37
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not a good singer.

38
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm not a good singer.

39
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not a good singer.

40
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm not a good singer.

41
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not a good singer.

42
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not a good singer.

43
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not a good singer.

44
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not a good singer.

45
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not a good singer.

46
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm not a good singer.

47
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not a good singer.

48
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm not a good singer.

49
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Have you ever heard of tirades?

50
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I have.

51
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But you have heard of a royalhhhh.

52
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I have.

53
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's see if I can.

54
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I have.

55
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Wait.

56
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Qingyuan City

57
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He spent half a year to open the mountain and dig the iron.

58
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He found the Western Zhou Imperial Seal where Yu Yong was.

59
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The iron-faced man used a special method to take out the men in the manhole.

60
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He sealed the stone coffin of the Fu Mu Shi.

61
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is the stone coffin that we just entered.

62
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
King of Lushan, according to the plan of the iron-faced man,

63
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
used the wooden tomb as a reason.

64
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Inside the dark place, on this Western Zhou Imperial Seal,

65
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
he built a tomb that looks like a fan.

66
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The tomb was made in the past.

67
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The tomb was built in the past.

68
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The tomb was built in the past.

69
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The tomb was built in the past.

70
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The tomb was built in the past.

71
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He built a tomb that looks like a fan.

72
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He even laid down a formation,

73
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
left seven coffins,

74
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and killed all the people who participated in the construction.

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Please wait.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Reporting, General. A Yakkuri girl requests a deep-seated interview.

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
奴悦 Lu Yue?

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Get up and talk.

79
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Why did you run out of the palace?

80
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,480
Did Yao Guang cause trouble?

81
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,280
First General, Madam...

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,600
She's dead.

83
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,840
Dead?

84
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,200
Madam was killed by His Majesty.

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,680
I saw it with my own eyes.

86
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,600
She's sleeping...

87
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,000
Please let us sit.

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,680
I'm a bastard.

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
I don't deserve this.

90
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Put me on the bed instead.

91
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Leave.

92
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,360
I'm going to kill that evil emperor and avenge the country.

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,600
General.

94
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Please calm down.

95
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,680
I've been following you for many years.

96
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,760
I know what you're thinking.

97
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,400
But now,

98
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,160
even if you return to the capital,

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,560
will you really win if you have more soldiers and soldiers?

100
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,360
Do I have to be so patient and win?

101
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,640
What you can't let go is just a ray of light.

102
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,320
But if a person dies, he can't come back to life.

103
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,240
I don't need you to teach me that!

104
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,360
General Fei Yan.

105
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,920
What I'm saying is that a person can come back to life if he dies.

106
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,200
At least, you should try it first.

107
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
If you can't come back to life,

108
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,200
you can take revenge.

109
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
A person can come back to life if he dies.

110
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,760
Tie Mingsheng.

111
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Are you talking nonsense?

112
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,760
The most exciting game on the line.

113
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
The mahjong is over.

114
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
The mahjong is over.

115
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
The prize-winning queen.

116
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
The treasure-hunting golden city.

117
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:22,040
The

118
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,040
reward-winning captain.

119
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
The reward-winning captain.

120
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,040
The reward-winning captain.

121
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,040
2772.

122
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,040
General, please let us talk.

123
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Tie Mingsheng.

124
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Your sentence, a person can come back to life if he dies.

125
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
What does it mean?

126
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
I've been studying the mystery of the wind and water.

127
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
I've heard that since ancient times,

128
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
a jade dragon was passed down.

129
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,040
It can make people return to life and come back to life.

130
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Now, General misses Yaoguang.

131
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,040
I think if Yaoguang's body is not damaged,

132
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,040
then, with the power of the jade dragon,

133
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,040
he can make people return to life.

134
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
What do you think?

135
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,040
Where is the jade dragon?

136
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,040
In a wooden room in a western imperial mausoleum.

137
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
With your ability,

138
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,040
it's not difficult to get that jade dragon.

139
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
What you said is true?

140
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Yaoguang.

141
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Yaoguang.

142
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Yaoguang.

143
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
It's an illusion.

144
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,040
General, don't you believe my knowledge?

145
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Okay.

146
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,040
I'll try your method.

147
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,040
If Yaoguang can come back to life,

148
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
you're my benefactor.

149
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,040
I'll reward you.

150
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
I still have something to say.

151
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Although the jade dragon can come back to life,

152
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
it can't be done in an instant.

153
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
During this time, we don't have a fixed time.

154
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,040
General, you have to find a place where it's safe and stable.

155
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,040
Wait for Yaoguang to come back to life.

156
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
In this world,

157
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,040
is it not a dead end?

158
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Unless we leave Lu State.

159
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,040
But if we want to leave Lu State from here,

160
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,040
I'm afraid it will take a long time.

161
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,040
How can we delay it?

162
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Unless...

163
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Unless what?

164
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Unless we get the jade dragon and go nowhere.

165
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
We'll stay in the forest in the west.

166
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Prepare enough food and shelter the entrance.

167
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,040
No one will come to disturb us.

168
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,040
I'm afraid

169
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
if there are too many people,

170
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
we'll be blocked by the trap.

171
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
No.

172
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,040
The dead won't talk.

173
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,680
A friendless river

174
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:14,320
Your

175
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,480
was destroyed.

176
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,680
What?

177
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,520
He was killed in the mountain?

178
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't know

179
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,400
the exact situation.

180
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,760
The letter only says

181
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,040
that there was a loud noise

182
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
in the mountain yesterday.

183
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,960
The local people went up the mountain to search.

184
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,200
They saw that the soil and wood

185
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,920
were all collapsed.

186
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,120
The road was blocked.

187
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,680
The general and his men

188
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,200
were completely lost.

189
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,040
I'm afraid that they were dead.

190
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Is there anyone

191
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,240
searching for the general there?

192
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Your Majesty,

193
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,800
there is no one searching for the general.

194
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,760
It is said that the wood and snow in the mountain

195
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,360
are all collapsed.

196
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,760
The local people

197
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,280
dare not go up the mountain.

198
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,800
Now that they are in the mountain collapse,

199
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,360
they are more willing to die.

200
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,840
That's good.

201
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,320
It's good that it's over.

202
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,680
That's great.

203
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,840
That mountain

204
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,640
is the tomb

205
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,080
that I gave to the general.

206
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,200
So,

207
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,560
this bastard really did

208
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,720
put in a lot of effort.

209
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,320
What happened after that?

210
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,080
It's gone.

211
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Gone?

212
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,640
I'm a scholar. You can't lie to me.

213
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,680
There are so many words on it.

214
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
You're gone.

215
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,040
I just said that

216
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
I only understand a little bit.

217
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Uncle San,

218
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,440
as for that iron-faced man,

219
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,080
it wasn't mentioned on it.

220
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,200
Could it be that he also buried his body?

221
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,840
How could he be so stupid?

222
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,000
He knew that King Lushan would kill people to kill him.

223
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,280
He couldn't have buried his body for him.

224
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,520
Of course he wouldn't.

225
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Because the one who was lying in the prison

226
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,400
wasn't King Lushan.

227
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,520
He turned his hands against King Xiping

228
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,360
to do it to me again.

229
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
How can I be so stupid?

230
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,160
Your Majesty,

231
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,960
do not be afraid.

232
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Lord Zhang,

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,720
don't kill me

234
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,920
for I killed you.

235
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,720
The End

236
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
or a hundred years,

237
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
I will wait

238
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
until you come back to life

239
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
or die.

240
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,520
General, I am sorry.

241
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
In ten days,

242
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Miss Yaoguang will surely

243
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
come back to life.

244
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,520
General,

245
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
you are really

246
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
brave.

247
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Thank you for killing

248
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
the people who died

249
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
to get rid of those

250
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
who died in your hands.

251
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
I am sorry.

252
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
I will wait until you come back to life.

253
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
I am sorry.

254
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
I am sorry.

255
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
I am sorry.

256
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
I am sorry.

257
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
I am sorry.

258
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
You killed those

259
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
who died in your hands.

260
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
You...

261
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
Beauty,

262
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,520
I have to trouble you

263
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
to leave this jade

264
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
to me.

265
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,520
So, in the end,

266
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,520
these two people were transferred?

267
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
This person is very careful.

268
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
He just wants to use

269
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
the power of King of Lushan

270
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
to achieve his goal of not being old.

271
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Brother,

272
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
you know all about this?

273
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
It feels like you have experienced it yourself.

274
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
In a past story,

275
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,520
I have read a whole

276
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
book about the war.

277
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Inside is the self-written story of Iron Man.

278
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
After he finished

279
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,520
all the plans of King of Lushan,

280
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
he set fire to his own family.

281
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
He threw a corpse

282
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,520
into the fire and pretended to be himself.

283
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
He went to Zhang Zhen's

284
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
body to escape death.

285
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
In the end,

286
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Iron Man got the jade

287
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
from King of Lushan

288
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
and he lied in it himself.

289
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
King of Lushan

290
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
worked hard to manage his life

291
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
but in the end, he did it for

292
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
others.

293
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
I am afraid that he didn't expect it.

294
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Then,

295
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,520
where is

296
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,520
King of Lushan's body?

297
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
I don't know.

298
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
There is no detailed record in the book.

299
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
It's getting dark.

300
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Let's go out.

301
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,520
No, no, no.

302
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
We haven't found the jade yet.

303
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,520
If we leave now, we will be waiting for the day to come.

304
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Right?

305
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Besides,

306
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
what if

307
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
they turn back

308
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
and find it?

309
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
We are not looking for the jade.

310
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
What is the jade?

311
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
What we are looking for

312
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
is more important than the jade.

313
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
I don't believe what women say.

314
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Do you believe it?

315
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Look.

316
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
I believe it.

317
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
You believe it?

318
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
You don't believe me?

319
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
You are too naive.

320
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,520
You are too naive.

321
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
He...

322
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
He is just a little bit better looking than me.

323
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
You believe him?

324
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Fine. Let's not talk about the jade.

325
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
We should

326
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
take this thing.

327
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Let me tell you.

328
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
This thing is the only one in the world.

329
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Right?

330
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
This...

331
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
I, Fatty,

332
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
am only thinking for the national interest.

333
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
This thing,

334
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
in the archaeology field,

335
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
is his discovery.

336
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
It's not ordinary.

337
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
What are you waiting for?

338
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Go.

339
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Sit.

340
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
We still have time.

341
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
It's getting dark. We must leave.

342
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
Including you.

343
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
We can't stay here for too long.

344
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Once the police are on the alert,

345
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
you can leave.

346
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
I'll go to find Ning.

347
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
You are so rich.

348
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
What did you say?

349
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
Liu Tai, don't forget.

350
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
We are the members of the group.

351
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Not individuals.

352
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
This is the tomb.

353
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
It's better to put them here.

354
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
It's the right place.

355
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Five years of birth and death.

356
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Five years of mutual care.

357
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
I never thought that

358
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
in the end,

359
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
I would be able to

360
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
leave this place.

361
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
I don't know

362
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
what I would do.

363
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
I don't know what I would do.

364
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
I should bury them myself.

365
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
You are here.

366
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,760
I've been waiting for you.

367
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,760
You come to find me.

368
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
I'm here to find you.

369
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Go.

370
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
He is here.

371
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
Let's go.

372
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Go.

373
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
He's here.

374
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
He's here.

375
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
He's here.

376
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
He's here.

377
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
He's here.

378
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,760
I'm here.

379
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
What's the matter with you?

380
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,560
No matter how you pretend, you're still a thief.

381
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,560
Chi Wang.

382
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Who's a thief?

383
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,360
Who do you think is a thief?

384
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Let me tell you.

385
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
This time, I'm going to be the one to write the draft.

386
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,960
I'm here to study the academic research.

387
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,360
I'm not here to be a scapegoat.

388
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,760
Who's here to be a scapegoat?

389
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,760
We're not here to be a scapegoat either.

390
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,360
How long have you been away from us?

391
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,960
When are we going to wait?

392
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,560
So if you really can't do it,

393
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,360
tell me and I'll come.

394
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,760
Come. Look at this.

395
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,160
Come.

396
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Come.

397
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,160
Don't touch that.

398
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,960
I've already checked it.

399
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,360
If you pick it up, it'll be torn apart.

400
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,960
That one doesn't work either.

401
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,360
This way.

402
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,560
Don't touch that one.

403
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,760
If you touch it, it'll break down easily.

404
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
What's wrong with you?

405
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,360
This book is quite high.

406
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,560
You need to put a lot of effort into climbing it.

407
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,960
You have to hold on.

408
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,760
Once you're up there, we'll be saved.

409
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,760
Do you know who that little brother is?

410
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,560
I don't know him.

411
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,960
Then why did you suddenly retreat when you saw him in the Inner Plane last time?

412
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,360
I was just following orders.

413
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,560
Who's life do you follow?

414
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,960
If you didn't come for the Daoist tree,

415
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,760
then who's life do you follow?

416
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,360
I'm just following orders.

417
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
If you didn't come for the Daoist tree,

418
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,560
then what are you doing here?

419
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Don't ask anymore. I won't say it.

420
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,360
Why do you think the people in the ancient city design such a troublesome thing?

421
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,960
That's right.

422
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,760
I don't believe it. I have to go in from that side.

423
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,960
I'm afraid I won't be able to find it.

424
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,360
Hurry up. Can you do it?

425
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,360
I said that your heart is useless. What if you get it wrong?

426
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,160
You'll get into trouble.

427
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,360
Third Master.

428
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,160
Look.

429
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,760
You want to die? I'll help you.

430
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,960
Wait.

431
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,960
Don't move.

432
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
You're just a corpse. Don't move.

433
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,360
Don't move?

434
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,760
You think so?

435
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,360
It's poisonous. It'll kill you if you get into it.

436
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
Hurry up and go.

437
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,760
Go.

438
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,160
What's going on?

439
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,560
What's going on?

440
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,360
Why are you chasing me? Why aren't you chasing Fatty?

441
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,760
What?

442
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,160
Don't chase Fatty. Don't chase Fatty.

443
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,360
You're chasing after a woman. You're chasing after a woman.

444
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,160
Fatty, what are you saying?

445
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Stop.

446
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,360
You...

447
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,160
Hey.

448
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,160
What did you say just now?

449
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,360
It's too late.

450
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,160
What do you mean, it's too late?

451
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,160
Let's go.

452
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,960
Oh my god.

453
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,960
Hurry.

454
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,360
Fatty.

455
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,160
Hurry.

456
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,960
Isn't this Xiao Ge's blood?

457
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,560
Isn't he better than Hua Lu Shu?

458
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Give me more.

459
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,560
There's a picture.

460
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Where is this? Why is there a tree?

461
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Did you see An Ning?

462
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,960
Hello? Hello?

463
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,760
Wu Xie? Wu Xie?

464
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,160
I...

465
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,760
Come.

466
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,160
Fatty, be careful.

467
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Fatty, hold on.

468
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,960
We can't die here.

469
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,560
No way.

470
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,760
Hey, there's a bomb over there.

471
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,360
We can't die here.

472
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,760
There's too much bomb.

473
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,360
We can't die here.

474
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,960
Hurry up. We can't hold on.

475
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,360
Hey.

476
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,560
Brother Huan, hold my leg.

477
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,560
What's wrong? Did you get in?

478
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,160
No matter what, we have to leave on time.

479
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,360
It's too dangerous down there.

480
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,760
If you go down, you'll die.

481
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,960
Hurry up.

482
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Wu Xie. Wu Xie.

483
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,360
Wu Xie, are you okay?

484
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,360
The soldiers are coming again.

485
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,560
Hurry up.

486
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,960
Hurry up.

487
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,560
Hold on.

488
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
An Ning, let go.

489
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,760
Let go.

490
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,360
Let go.

491
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,760
Let go.

492
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,160
I gave you a second. You forgot.

493
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,360
Don't let go.

494
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,160
No.

495
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,960
No.

496
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,960
Wu Xie.

497
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
Stay still for awhile.

498
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,560
Master.

499
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,600
Take a deep breath.

500
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,920
Are you okay?

501
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,760
I am fine.

502
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,280
Han ending.

503
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,800
Raise yourself up.

504
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,080
The blood is still weak. You all leave now.

505
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,280
Don't worry about me. I'm poisoned. You all leave first.

506
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,880
Stop talking nonsense.

507
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,520
We're here. If you want to be poisoned, then let's be poisoned together.

508
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,800
Fatty, you still want to be poisoned?

509
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,960
Let me tell you. If you're poisoned, no one can hurt you.

510
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,960
I'm going to kill you. Hurry and leave.

511
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,360
Hold on.

512
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,600
You Li!

513
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,480
Let go of my hand.

514
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,760
It's fine now.

515
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,760
Wu Xun! I'm pulling you up here!

516
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,320
Fatty!

517
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,240
Are you going to make it?

518
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,840
You're my fat friends!

519
00:29:45,840 --> 00:30:10,280
You Now, don't hold on.

520
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
I'm sorry.

521
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Han Shao.

522
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Changcheng.

523
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
He's finally back.

524
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Fatty, are you okay?

525
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Hurry, put the firewood in the fire.

526
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
Yes, yes, yes.

527
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Burn them.

528
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Burn them.

529
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
Fire.

530
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Wu Xie, do you have a lighter?

531
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
Fatty, fire.

532
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Fire.

533
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Yes, yes, yes.

534
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,840
Fire.

535
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
A good tomb was destroyed.

536
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,840
I don't know how many precious documents were copied.

537
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,840
Doing things, you have to pay a price.

538
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
I don't know what you're going to do.

539
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
But this is too expensive.

540
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
Too expensive.

541
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,840
Too many precious historical documents will disappear because of these relics.

542
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
And become a secret forever.

543
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,840
How is it?

544
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
They didn't come out.

545
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,840
They must have had an accident.

546
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
I told you to go down.

547
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
You're the one who stopped me.

548
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
If you don't go, I'll go.

549
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Wait for me.

550
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,840
Just because of you, going down is like giving up.

551
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Just like your friends.

552
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
I'm telling you.

553
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,840
Even if I know there's danger, I'll save my friends next time.

554
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
I'm not you.

555
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,840
I'll just wait here and do nothing.

556
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Take them back with me.

557
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Let's go.

558
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Let's go.

559
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Let's go.

560
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,840
Cao Nie.

561
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,840
My Yu Yong.

562
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Looks like there's no hope.

563
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
It's all your fault.

564
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,840
You've been studying for a long time.

565
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,840
You should have brought a piece out.

566
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,840
You're destroying cultural relics.

567
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,840
Not like us.

568
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,880
You're the real

569
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,840
test-takers.

570
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
I'm telling you.

571
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Mine is called protecting cultural relics.

572
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
I can bring it out to rebuild the day.

573
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
You say it's a piece.

574
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
The future can see it.

575
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,840
How good is that?

576
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Who would want to be a corpse king?

577
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
Stop talking.

578
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,840
If you see it, just pretend you've seen it.

579
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
It's good if you don't see it.

580
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Now Xin Cheng is dying.

581
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
Where's Meng Youping?

582
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
He should be here.

583
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Isn't he with you?

584
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
I don't know where he went after he saved me.

585
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Don't worry.

586
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
He's so good.

587
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
He'll be fine.

588
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
No way.

589
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
He didn't come out, did he?

590
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
Meng Youping.

591
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Stop looking.

592
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Brother.

593
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Stop looking.

594
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
It's getting dark.

595
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
We have to get out of this forest.

596
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Maybe he's outside.

597
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Right?

598
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
No.

599
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,840
We have to go back to look for Chen Renchen and Han Shao.

600
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
I didn't see him at the tomb.

601
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Did your men take him?

602
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Ning.

603
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
Where did your men take them?

604
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,840
I know where they are.

605
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
Liu Tai.

606
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
It's time.

607
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
We should leave.

608
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Wait.

609
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,840
You have to trust Ning.

610
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Leave.

611
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
Leave.

612
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
You gave up so easily.

613
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
You don't care about me?

614
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
I really look down on you.

615
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Who said that?

616
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
You have to wait for Ning to leave.

617
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
You're a coward.

618
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
Coward.

619
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,840
I'll shoot you here.

620
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Shoot.

621
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Youzhu, shoot.

622
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Calm down.

623
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
It's no use killing us.

624
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
If Ning gets hurt,

625
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
we can take her to the hospital.

626
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Or you'll all leave.

627
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
She'll die anyway.

628
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Okay.

629
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
I'll leave you here.

630
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
If Ning comes back safely,

631
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
you'll be fine.

632
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
After you come back,

633
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
let Ning contact me.

634
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Liu Tai.

635
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
They have no use for you.

636
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Stop.

637
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Ning.

638
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
Ning.

639
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Wu Xie.

640
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
Ning.

641
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
You're hurt.

642
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
Are you okay?

643
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
I'm fine.

644
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
I knew you wouldn't die so easily.

645
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Wu Xie, are you okay?

646
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
Are you hurt?

647
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
I'm fine.

648
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Why did you come up alone?

649
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Did Third Uncle and the others come out together?

650
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
They're fine too.

651
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
They went back to the village.

652
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
We have to go back now.

653
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Okay.

654
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Why are you with him?

655
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I'll explain when we get back.

656
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
This way.

657
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
This way.

658
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Let's go.

659
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
What's going on?

660
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
What's wrong?

661
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
Where are you going?

662
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Ning.

663
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,840
Ning.

664
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,840
What are you looking for?

665
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
A secret.

666
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
Next time you see me,

667
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
you won't be so lucky.

668
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,840
It looks romantic under the ancient tomb.

669
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
And it has a female guest.

670
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

671
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,840
When are you still joking?

672
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
Are you okay?

673
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,840
I think you're fine.

674
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
I'm fine.

675
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
I'm fine.

676
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,840
I think you're about to faint.

677
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
I...

678
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
What's wrong?

679
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
Wu Xie!

680
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
Are you serious?

681
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
Wu Xie, you're awake.

682
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
Uncle San.

683
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
How do you feel?

684
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
I'm fine.

685
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
I just feel a little tired.

686
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Young people nowadays

687
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
are too weak, too arrogant,

688
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840
and lack exercise.

689
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
You've spent so little energy

690
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
and slept all day.

691
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
I slept for so long?

692
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
I'm not that tired.

693
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,840
I'm just tired.

694
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
I'm tired.

695
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
I'm tired.

696
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
I'm tired.

697
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
I'm tired.

698
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
I'm tired.

699
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
Here, eat it while it's hot.

700
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
It's good for your health.

701
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
By the way, Uncle San,

702
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
how's Pan Zi?

703
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
She has a wound infection and is resting.

704
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,840
I'm going to send her to the hospital in Jinan.

705
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Uncle San,

706
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
why don't you go back to Hangzhou and rest?

707
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,840
We'll send Pan Zi to the hospital in Jinan.

708
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
That's fine.

709
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,840
But you have to pay for her medical bills.

710
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
We're just concerned about her.

711
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Wu Xie,

712
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,840
you go back to Hangzhou with Chengcheng and Haishao.

713
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,840
There's a fire!

714
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
There's a fire!

715
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
Where is there a fire?

716
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,840
There's a fire!

717
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
Uncle San,

718
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840
did we set the fire and burn Sanlin?

719
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Look at the direction and the location.

720
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
It's really the fire we set.

721
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
Oh, no.

722
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
Now the fire has broken through.

723
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
There's no way.

724
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
We were in such a hurry.

725
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
I think

726
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
you're only bold and not careful.

727
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
Uncle San,

728
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
if you had taken me with you,

729
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,840
there wouldn't be this situation.

730
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,840
Look,

731
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
I'm here,

732
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
and there's a good player like Pan Zi.

733
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,840
Wu Xie has been walking around in Guimu Pass.

734
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,840
If you really want to go down,

735
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,840
how can I put my heart in it?

736
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Chengcheng,

737
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,840
the project is not as simple as you think.

738
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,840
I regret that I didn't go down with you.

739
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
Where's Fatty and Haishao?

740
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
I don't know.

741
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
I don't know.

742
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,980
cans of wars or three times more

743
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:52,980
High rate of compensation, high rate of reward, more opportunities to take revenge, join the Macau New Beijing Entertainment City 772772.com

744
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,980
The Macau New Beijing Entertainment City 772772.com

745
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:49,980
I'll keep carrying on, we have to be strong

746
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,980
Still a long long way to go

747
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:01,980
Until I see the sun, I see the light

748
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:09,980
I hear the triumph, let's solve the mystery

749
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:17,980
A little dream, I see the light

750
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:25,980
I hear the triumph, let's write our story

751
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:36,980

752
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:59,980
Smashing through the door into another world
