I'm not a good singer.

58
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not a good singer.

59
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not a good singer.

60
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not a good singer.

61
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not a good singer.

62
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not a good singer.

63
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not a good singer.

64
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not a good singer.

65
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not a good singer.

66
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not a good singer.

67
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not a good singer.

68
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not a good singer.

69
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not a good singer.

70
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not a good singer.

71
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not a good singer.

72
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not a good singer.

73
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The Empress of Attack

74
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I heard

75
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that you can't take it off from outside.

76
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Do we have to take it out?

77
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I just said that your South Sect

78
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
doesn't have any technical content.

79
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It doesn't carry or knock.

80
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Can you think of a way

81
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
to take it off?

82
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I just said

83
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
that we must take it off.

84
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How else can we take it off?

85
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What if we take it off?

86
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's do it.

87
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Be careful.

88
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't move!

89
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What are you doing?

90
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He's breathing.

91
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Put on your mask.

92
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't move.

93
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Be careful.

94
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't move.

95
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll go check.

96
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's go.

97
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's go.

98
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's go.

99
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's go.

100
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's go.

101
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's go.

102
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's go.

103
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's go.

104
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No matter what it is, shoot him!

105
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,600
No, An Ning! Don't do it yet.

106
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,880
If he's alive, we can't shoot him.

107
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,640
What time is it? You're still thinking about this?

108
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,960
No. If he's alive, we're killing him.

109
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,880
Okay, okay.

110
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,440
Wu Xie, you're too naive.

111
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,560
If the old man is not dead, he's a demon.

112
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,440
Three thousand years.

113
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,200
He can't be alive.

114
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,120
If he's alive, then it's good.

115
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,520
Let's go out.

116
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,720
Third Uncle,

117
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,000
what is this?

118
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,480
This is the skin he took off.

119
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,080
What skin disease did the King of Lushan have?

120
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,560
He lost so much skin.

121
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,520
Don't talk nonsense.

122
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,280
Every time he changes his skin, he gets younger.

123
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
Look at the total amount of the skin.

124
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,320
He must have taken off four or five times.

125
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,960
Let's not worry about that.

126
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,280
Even if he has or doesn't have any breathing,

127
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,080
we still have to take off the jade, right?

128
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,320
This is too loud. It's too loud.

129
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,280
This is not the noise I made. It's coming from the underground.

130
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
You didn't make it.

131
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,680
If you don't say it, we can't keep in touch with Wu Xie.

132
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,880
I thought this was your strategy.

133
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,880
What's wrong with the noise?

134
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,480
There's a strange magnetic field underground.

135
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,880
It's disturbing the signal.

136
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,080
The signal is weak and strong.

137
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
That means...

138
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
They're moving.

139
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
They didn't stop.

140
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
They're moving.

141
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
They didn't stop.

142
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
This means they're safe.

143
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
For now, it's like this.

144
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,080
But the signal is so strong.

145
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm afraid they'll meet a big boss.

146
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Third Uncle, what should we do next?

147
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Should we really carry the whole thing out?

148
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
Game.

149
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
What game?

150
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Fatty, you're really good.

151
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Your eyes are so sharp. So many lines.

152
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,080
You can also find such a thin thing.

153
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,080
You guys are really hard to deal with.

The queen of rewards.

158
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Find the golden city.

159
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,080
The super high rate of rewards.

160
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
The reward frequency is high.

161
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080

164
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Guys,

165
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,080
from the academic point of view,

166
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
this is a play.

167
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Don't be anxious.

168
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,080
It's not like you.

169
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
You want to get every one of them.

170
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Right?

171
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Now you're losing to me.

172
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
I'm here.

173
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,080
You have to tear this thing down.

174
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
You can't drag it out.

175
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Think about it.

176
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
I admire myself.

177
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,080
I want to kneel down and give myself a lesson.

178
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
What do you think?

179
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Go to hell.

180
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Why don't you say this is a trap?

181
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,080
Maybe he was here.

182
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,080
You...

183
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,080
You're jealous for the comrades.

184
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Look carefully.

185
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Aomenshin.

186
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
Who?

187
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
You're a big guy.

188
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Men Youping?

189
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Ani.

190
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Is this your partner?

191
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
He also

192
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
misused Mu Xue Li's water in the illusion.

193
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
That's why he's like this.

194
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
What were you doing?

195
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,080
You have to make it clear to me.

196
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
Don't think I'm afraid of you

197
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
because you're a big guy.

198
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
I'll kill you.

199
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,080
Fatty.

200
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Okay, you want to fight me?

201
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Come on, who's going to compete with me?

202
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Fatty, what are you doing?

203
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
Take your time.

204
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Didn't you hear me?

205
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Calm down.

206
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,080
If you want to kill me,

207
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
I'll do it.

208
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,080
Okay.

209
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
You want to fight me?

210
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
I know you're a big guy.

211
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
But you're not afraid of me?

212
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
Come on.

213
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
Take it.

214
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,080
I want to fight you.

215
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
I want to fight you.

216
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
I want to fight you.

217
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,080
I want to fight you.

218
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,080
Come on.

219
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
What do you want?

220
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
I want to fight you.

221
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
I'm not a coward.

222
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,840
If I want to be fat, I won't let you finish.

223
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Fatty, don't take it to heart.

224
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,240
I don't want to take it to heart.

225
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,600
Enough, Xiao Ge.

226
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,320
Give him an explanation.

227
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
This thing has been self-sufficient for 500 years.

228
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,440
Only when it's peeled off can it be removed.

229
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
If you forcefully pull it off,

230
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,840
the body inside will turn into a blood-stained corpse.

231
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,200
The corpse in this prison has been left behind for over 3,000 years.

232
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,600
As long as you pull the string, it will immediately die.

233
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
We will all die here.

234
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,360
Fatty, you heard it, right?

235
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
He didn't want to kill you. He wanted to save us.

236
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Fine.

237
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,560
Look at what you said.

238
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,360
You still have a bit of reason.

239
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
I will spare you.

240
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Xiao Ge,

241
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,480
I am a person who is quick to say what I want to say.

242
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,160
I think you know this place very well.

243
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,960
If it's convenient for you, just tell everyone.

244
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,360
Don't let us risk our lives.

245
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
There is a purple jade box in the organ.

246
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Everything you want to know is in that box.

247
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Who are you?

248
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,760
Even if you know, what can you do?

249
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,760
This is too small. I can't see it clearly.

250
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
What is written on it?

251
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,760
This should be the experience of King of Lushan's life.

252
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
I studied this kind of text before.

253
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,760
But I can only recognize a little bit.

254
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
You are better at recognizing a little bit than us.

255
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Hurry up. Pick some that you can understand.

256
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
Read it with us.

257
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,760
I only understand that there are records of people who died here.

258
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,440
I only understand that there are two things recorded in this.

259
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,440
One of them is that King of Lushan got the gold of Ghost Realm.

260
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
When King of Lushan was 20 years old,

261
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,440
he inherited the official position from his father.

262
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,440
He stole the ancient tomb for the army of the Lu State.

263
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,440
He used gold to collect the military funds.

264
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Once, he entered a tomb that was unknown in what era.

265
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,440
He found a huge snake lying in that coffin.

266
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,440
King of Lushan cut the snake with one knife.

267
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,440
He forced the opening of the tomb.

268
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,440
From the snake's stomach, he dug out a...

269
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
gold box.

270
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
The gold box in the Qingyan Lake?

271
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
It should be.

272
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Wu Xie, continue talking.

273
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,120
That night, King of Lushan dreamed of this huge snake to seek revenge.

274
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,120
He said, I can kill it if I want to.

275
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,120
King of Lushan cut the snake in his dream again.

276
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,120
When he was about to take the snake's head,

277
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,120
the snake suddenly asked for mercy.

278
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
The beggar said,

279
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,120
my body has already been killed.

280
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,120
If it disappears again,

281
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,120
I will never be able to get over it.

282
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,800
This huge snake told King of Lushan

283
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,800
that there are two treasures in the gold box.

284
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,800
It can protect King of Lushan from the people.

285
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,800
And it also told King of Lushan how to open the box.

286
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
King of Lushan knew about this matter because of the will of the heavens.

287
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
He shouldn't be publicizing it to the world.

288
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,800
So he cut the snake.

289
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,480
King of Lushan is quite ruthless.

290
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Don't interrupt.

291
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Didn't you hear that there are two treasures in here?

292
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
One of them must be a ghost.

293
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,480
What about the other one?

294
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,480
There is no other treasure on this.

295
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,480
It's just that King of Lushan used it quite well.

296
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,480
Although the snake is dead,

297
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,480
King of Lushan still feels uneasy.

298
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,160
So he killed his subordinates and his followers.

299
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,160
He even killed the child who just got pregnant.

300
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
King of Lushan must have been possessed by some evil spirit.

301
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Otherwise, he wouldn't be so cruel.

302
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Look at you, you're fighting again.

303
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Don't talk, Brother.

304
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Listen to me, okay?

305
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,160
He couldn't have killed so many people by himself.

306
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
Right?

307
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Then he must have used the box to protect it.

308
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Hurry and read what's going on in the back.

309
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Can you analyze it? It seems like you can understand.

310
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
How about this? I'll show you.

311
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Come.

312
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
In the next ten years,

313
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
King of Lushan will use the treasure

314
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
to make a living.

315
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
It will be a glorious life.

316
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
Go.

317
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Go.

318
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840

319
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840

Go.

321

Go.

322
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Go.

323
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Go.

324
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Go.

325
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Go.

326
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Go.

327
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Go.

328
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,840
Go.

329
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Go.

330
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Go.

331
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Go.

332
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Go.

333
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
Chase after her!

334
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Go.

335
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Go.

336
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Go.

337
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Go.

338
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
Go.

339
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,880
Li Changundu

340
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,840
Come on

341
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,920
Come on

342
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Go

343
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,520

344
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,440
Go

345
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Go

346
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,780
Assault! runs in seconds

347
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,040
Say as

348
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,880
just to escape from us!

349
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,480
Yaoguang,

350
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,880
hurry!

351
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,080
Yaoguang,

352
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,920
yao- vardır!

353
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,480
Yaoguang,

354
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,600
Yaoguang!

355
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Run!

356
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
There's a cliff ahead

357
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Where are you going?

358
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Take your beauty back to the underground

359
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Look at me! Watch your back!

360
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Leave me alone!

361
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Run!

362
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Watch out!

363
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
What's that?

364
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Run!

365
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Stop!

366
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Run!

367
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
It's you

368
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Why did you come back so late?

369
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Where have you been all these years?

370
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Youguo!

371
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Come up!

372
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Let's go!

373
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Your Majesty, the rebels have been destroyed!

374
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Youguo, are you hurt?

375
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Are you scared?

376
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
I'm fine

377
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
It's you who saved me

378
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
General

379
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,600
You not only saved my life today

380
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,600
But also my beloved concubine

381
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,600
This is a great credit

382
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,600
I will reward you well

383
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I don't deserve it

384
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
General

385
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Youguo

386
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Why did you call me?

387
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Youguo

388
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
How could you...

389
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,600
How could I become the wife of the Lü Palace?

390
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Why didn't I wait for you to come back and marry me?

391
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
You liar!

392
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
You said you would work for me

393
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,600
But you never came back!

394
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
All these years

395
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,600
You didn't even give me a letter

396
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,600
My family said you were dead

397
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,600
They all said you were dead

398
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,600
They forced me to marry the Lü Palace

399
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
I hate you

400
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
I hate you! I hate you!

401
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Where have you been all these years?

402
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,600
What have you been doing?

403
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
I'm sorry, Youguo

404
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
All these years

405
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,600
I've been digging for the gold for the Lü Palace

406
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Digging for the gold is a crime against the heaven

407
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,600
So I've been hiding

408
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Only the Lü Palace and its Jin clan know about my existence

409
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
What's wrong with you, a man?

410
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Why do you have to do such a thing?

411
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
You don't understand

412
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Now the Central Plains is in war

413
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,600
If we don't have the gold and the treasure

414
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,600
How can we win the war?

415
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
But I didn't expect

416
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,600
I worked for the Lü Palace

417
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
But he took my beloved woman

418
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Since you said I was your beloved woman

419
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Take me away from here

420
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,600
I'll follow you to the end of the world

421
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Okay?

422
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,600
How do you clean this yard?

423
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Go

424
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Yes

425
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
This place is not for staying

426
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Go back and wait for me

427
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
I'll come back and take you away

428
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
Don't worry

429
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
I won't let you go this time

430
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
If there's a lie

431
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
I'll be beaten to death

432
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
I'll take you away

433
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
I'll kill you

434
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
I'll kill you

435
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
I'll kill you

436
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
I'll kill you

437
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
I'll kill you

438
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I'll kill you

439
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
I'll kill you

440
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Yu Yong

441
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
I want to hear the key

442
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Where did Yu Yong come from?

443
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
After a short while,

444
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,600
King of Lushan's body has a lot of problems.

445
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
One day,

446
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
King of Lushan in his dream,

447
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
he dreamt of a giant snake and said,

448
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
We are all waiting for you in the netherworld.

449
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,600
After he woke up, he was very scared.

450
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
So,

451
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
he went to his military counselor

452
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,600
and begged him.

453
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
He said,

454
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Iron-faced Saint, please.

455
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Iron-faced Saint?

456
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Did it mention who the Iron-faced Saint is?

457
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
No.

458
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,600
It just said that this military counselor is good at fencing.

459
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
He said to King of Lushan,

460
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Shanggu has a kind of jade.

461
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
If you wear it,

462
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
you can turn old and return to your old.

463
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
You can rise and die.

464
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,600
I've searched countless desolation forests and deserts.

465
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,600
I've fought countless demons and ghosts.

466
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,600
I've got countless treasures.

467
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,600
But I've lost a beautiful woman's heart.

468
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,600
As long as what you want,

469
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,600
I will try my best.

470
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,600
There's no general here.

471
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
And no military counselor.

472
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Iron-faced Saint,

473
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,600
I only have what you believe.

474
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
There's one thing

475
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,600
I want to entrust to you.

476
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Madam, this way, please.

477
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
I'm sorry.

478
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
I'm sorry.

479
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
I'm sorry.

480
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
This way.

481
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
This way.

482
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Madam, I can't go on.

483
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,600
General is waiting for you over there.

484
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
I'm sorry.

485
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
I've got to go.

486
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
I'm sorry.

487
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
I've got to go.

488
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
How dare you

489
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
even break into the palace?

490
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
I dare not only break into the palace,

491
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
I want to take the beauty.

492
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Demon Lord, I've decided.

493
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
I'm taking you away.

494
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
Really?

495
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
I'm taking you away.

496
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I'm taking you away.

497
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
The King has ordered

498
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,600
the general to depart immediately.

499
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
It's strange.

500
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Why did the King

501
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
suddenly get anxious this time?

502
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Is he worried that

503
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,600
you've made too many treasures?

504
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Oh no.

505
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
I was planning to

506
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
find the time

507
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,600
to take Yao Guang away.

508
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Now the King suddenly asked me to leave.

509
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,600
I'm afraid I'll have a lot of dreams if I go.

510
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
But if I don't go,

511
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,600
I'm afraid the King will be suspicious.

512
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,600
I'm suspicious.

513
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Go ahead.

514
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
But this time,

515
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
we must hurry up.

516
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
We must go early.

517
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
Okay.

518
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
I'll go prepare now.

519
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Go.

520
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Yang Guang,

521
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
I've decided.

522
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
I'm taking you away.

523
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
I'm taking you away.

524
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Greetings, King.

525
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Greetings, King.

526
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
My dear, please rise.

527
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
You may leave.

528
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Greetings, King.

529
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
My dear,

530
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,600
please sit down.

531
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Sit down.

532
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Look at what I've brought you.

533
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Do you like it?

534
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
I'll put it on for you.

535
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Look.

536
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Do you like it?

537
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Thank you, King.

538
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
My dear,

539
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
you and I haven't seen each other for a long time.

540
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Do you miss me?

541
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
I

542
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
naturally miss you.

543
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
My dear,

544
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
I'm afraid

545
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
you miss someone else.

546
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,600
I don't understand what you're saying.

547
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,600
You don't understand what I'm saying.

548
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
I'm sure you can understand

549
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,600
what the Great General said.

550
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
King.

551
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
King.

552
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
I...

553
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,600
If you don't have the full confidence,

554
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,600
how can I say these things to you?

555
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Do you still want to give excuses?

556
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
King, please forgive me.

557
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
I'm guilty.

558
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
It's all my fault.

559
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
I seduced the Great General.

560
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
The Great General doesn't know.

561
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Yaoguang,

562
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,600
you're so naive.

563
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Do you know where the Great General is now?

564
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
He saw the truth.

565
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
He couldn't escape from me.

566
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
He knelt down and begged for mercy.

567
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
He promised he would never see you again.

568
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
And for the sake of the Great General,

569
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,600
he took his men

570
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
to dig for the gold and silver treasure for me.

571
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
You're defending him.

572
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,600
You said you seduced him.

573
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
Do you know

574
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
what he said to me?

575
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
No.

576
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
No.

577
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Yaoguang,

578
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
I treated you so well.

579
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,600
But you gave your heart

580
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
to that ungrateful person.

581
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
You're so silly.

582
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
You're so cute.

583
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
No.

584
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
No.

585
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,600
Come back.

586
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Where are you going?

587
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
You lied to me.

588
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
I'm going to find him.

589
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Let me go.

590
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Come on.

591
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Come on.

592
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Lock her up.

593
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Never see her again.

594
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Yes.

595
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
Let me out.

596
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Let me out.

597
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Let me out!

598
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Let me out!

599
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Let me out!

600
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Let me out!

601
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
No.

602
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
I can't be the substitute.

603
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Let me out!

604
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Let me out!

605
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,600
Madam, please eat.

606
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Ru Yue,

607
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
the peach is a little cold.

608
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Go warm it up.

609
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Yes, Madam.

610
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Madam,

611
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
you must wash and dress up.

612
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
It's cold and windy today.

613
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
You should rest early.

614
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Okay.

615
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Ru Yue,

616
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
this is the letter I wrote to the general.

617
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
You should find a way to give it to the general.

618
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Now the king knows everything.

619
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
I'm afraid he will be unfavorable to the general.

620
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
If he asks me,

621
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
you just say anything.

622
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Don't let him worry.

623
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Remember?

624
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
My dear wife,

625
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
I'm here.

626
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600

I've been giving you so many days

633
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
to calm you down.

634
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
I don't know if you've thought it through.

635
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
As long as you can think it through

636
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
and change your mind,

637
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
I can do it.

638
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Your Majesty,

639
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
you're drunk.

640
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Go back and rest early.

641
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
My dear wife,

642
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600

643
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600

Go!

652
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
What is this?

653
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Your Majesty, please spare me!

654
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
I don't know what this is!

655
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
What is this?

656
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Keep living!

You are a bitch.

664
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,200
You still have the nerve to plead for her.

665
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,000
You disregard my affection for you.

666
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,120
You always think of your bitch father.

667
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,880
Fine.

Why are you back here,

772
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,720
but you're the attorney,

773
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,680
I left.

774
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,680
Ready or not,

I'll put worldly trivialities

780
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,840

We had to be strong

784
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,880
Still a long long way to run

785
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,080
Until I see the sun

786
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,280
