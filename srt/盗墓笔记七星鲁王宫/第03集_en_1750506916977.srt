Don't mind him.

8
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's the only one who's going to pass the bow.

9
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He's just a temper.

10
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He starts the bow every day.

11
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Sometimes he doesn't get up all day.

12
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He doesn't start the bow all day.

13
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This box is not small.

14
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How can he pass the bow alone?

15
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He Shen is just for his sake.

16
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If it were someone else,

17
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
he wouldn't be able to get out as soon as he enters the cave.

18
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He's fine.

19
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you know how to cut a gourd,

20
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
you can just turn it over from the mountain.

21
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You have so many things.

22
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's not enough to use the gourd in our village.

23
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Old man, what?

24
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Can people eat in the cave?

25
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Everyone says that there are snakes in the cave.

26
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No one has ever come out.

27
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He's fine.

28
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Everyone says he's a snake.

29
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Snake?

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
A snake?

31
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What about their dogs?

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Can they get in?

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Dogs are also raised in his house.

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Of course, it's fine.

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If it were someone else,

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
not only dogs,

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
even cows can't get in.

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Lv Dandan, come here.

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No way.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is there something in the cave?

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What is it?

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why does the dog smell so bad?

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How many days has he not taken a shower?

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Little Third Master,

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
you still owe me some money

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
if you want to choose your third uncle.

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Old man,

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
please tell the shipkeeper

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
to see if he can get on the boat.

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We're in a hurry.

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Thank you.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let me tell you.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
When did they start the boat?

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
They've been together since the beginning.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What a bad luck!

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Why are they acting like that?

The prize-winning queen.

Find the treasure of the Golden City.

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Recruit the cat.

Reward the gold captain.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And so on.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
High rate of compensation.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The reward rate is high.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There are many opportunities to pay back.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000

Why are you hiding?

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You have to pretend.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll discuss this with them.

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No problem.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I think that cave is the cave of the dead.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The ship's work is the same.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No way.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What's in the cave?

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A few years ago, Pan Zi and I

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
found a cave like this near Shanxi.

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's used for Japanese slaughter.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There must be a slaughter in the cave.

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's for sure.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Did you go into that cave?

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We didn't dare to go in when we first started.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But later, because we were curious...

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Of course you were curious.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What happened next?

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We did an experiment there.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We put the dog and duck on the bamboo raft.

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And a camera.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Pushed into the cave to film.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We didn't expect...

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What?

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Half-face.

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is too scary.

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You scared me.

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Are you that exaggerating?

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Third Uncle, continue.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Whose face is it?

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's too close to the camera.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can't tell what it is.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But I did some research.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In ancient times, if you want to go through a cave like that,

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
you have to mix the dead with the living.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So that the dead can be trapped in the body.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Very mysterious.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
How about we just walk?

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We can walk the mountain path.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But it's a waste of time.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's also a problem for Chen Chengcheng's safety.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Besides, the cave is also drawn on the tree.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Since we came here with this tree,

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
we can still take the risk.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We're new here.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What's there to be afraid of?

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's settled.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There might be a problem with the ship.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Be careful.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Everyone, I'll put the things on the second ship.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You guys take the first ship.

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Come, let me help you.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Come, let me help you.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No need.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Some things are not visible.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's better to carry them with you.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If the ship shakes, the things will fall.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Then we'll all be dead.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What you said is reasonable.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But this ship is very stable.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't worry.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If it really falls, I'll help you.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I won't let you down.

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Come on.

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Uncle, this old man is quite considerate of us.

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
They must have a plan.

138
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Keep an eye on them.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Get on the ship.

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Does the ship look like a ghost?

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Is he really eating that?

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't listen to what Third Uncle said.

143
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He likes to scare people.

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
When you guys are inside the cave,

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
don't talk loudly.

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
In case of a nuclear bomb.

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't talk about the nuclear bomb.

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There's a nuclear bomb?

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
How long do we need to get through the cave?

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Looking at the current water flow,

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
it should take fifteen minutes.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There are several bowls in front.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's quite dangerous.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Is it bright inside?

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a long cave.

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
How could there be a light?

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Inside the cave,

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:12,920
there are all

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If you're lucky,

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
you'll see a black water.

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If you're not,

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
you'll see your hero.

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't want to see it.

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why is it suddenly getting cold here?

165
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Wait for a while.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
From here, the water will start to get heavier.

167
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It'll be fine after we get out of the cave.

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This cave is too narrow.

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Everyone, this is a good place.

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The front part is lower than this.

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This cave is so small.

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If someone wants to rob us,

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
we'll be in trouble.

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We'll be in trouble.

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We'll be in trouble.

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If someone wants to rob us,

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
we'll be in trouble.

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Uncle,

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
looking at the structure of this cave,

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
it should be a passage.

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This is the passage?

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The water passage is five meters long.

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This cave is old.

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It seems that there must be a tunnel in this cave.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This brother seems to have a lot of knowledge.

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're right.

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This mountain is an old tomb.

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's not only big and small water tunnels.

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The water level before was not that high.

190
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's all drought.

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It seems that you're an expert.

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Expert can't hold it.

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I also heard from people who came here before.

194
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You heard a lot.

195
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Of course, you can say a few words.

196
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What I said is all nonsense.

197
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Fortunately, Chen Cheng Cheng didn't come.

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Otherwise, he would have been sent off.

199
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't know how Chen Cheng Cheng is doing.

200
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't know anything.

201
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
His personality is hard to take advantage of.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Listen.

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What sound is it?

204
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Old man, this sound is...

205
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They... Where are they?

206
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Pan Zi, where are they?

207
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't know.

208
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I didn't hear anything.

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I only heard strange sounds from the cave.

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
They disappeared.

211
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
They...

212
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Did they get eaten?

213
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
They are not here.

214
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
They are not here.

215
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
They are not here.

216
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
They are not here.

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They must have eaten something.

218
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
They left a little bone.

219
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
They don't have any traces of them.

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This is bad.

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We don't have any wet clothes.

222
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't know what will happen next.

223
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What should we do now?

224
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Start the motor.

225
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Third Master, they ruined it.

226
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Third Master, they ruined it.

227
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Be careful.

228
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh my god.

229
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What is this?

230
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
This...

231
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What are you afraid of?

232
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You are useless.

233
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I told you not to come.

234
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You still followed us.

235
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Third Master, this is too big.

236
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We are not even tall enough.

237
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I have been running for so long.

238
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I have seen many monsters.

239
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Don't make trouble.

240
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Fu Xie.

241
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Didn't you come for the protection?

242
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Don't be afraid.

243
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I am here.

244
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Third Master.

245
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The first time you got into an accident,

246
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
you were in such a dangerous situation.

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It is normal to be heartbroken.

248
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This hole is indeed a little strange.

249
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If there is anything, let's go out and talk.

250
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes.

251
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Let's go out first.

252
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Brother.

253
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Brother.

254
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Crown Prince.

255
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What did this person see?

256
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't know.

257
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I only know that this person has two faces.

258
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Look.

259
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
How long did he practice his hand like this?

260
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Why is his finger so long?

261
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It is like a human's tear.

262
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Little Third Master.

263
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You should have heard that

264
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
when a wolf is born,

265
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
there is a kind of

266
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
double-fingered bone-in-bone.

267
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
In ancient times,

268
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
the masters of the middle-level general of the game of Go

269
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
all had a special finger.

270
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It was as stable as a mountain.

271
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It had a lot of power.

272
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It could easily break

273
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
the small and strange mechanism in the wood.

274
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I thought that this martial art was just a legend.

275
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It is not easy to be able to practice this kind of martial art.

276
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You must practice it from a young age.

277
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And the practice process is very hard.

278
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So impressive.

279
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This is what I was looking for.

280
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Isn't this a dragon lion?

281
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So that means that the chair in the group just now

282
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
was a group of dragon lions.

283
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You scared me to death.

284
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You have been stepped on. Move aside.

285
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No.

286
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
How come there are so many dragon lions

287
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
moving at the same time?

288
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And the dragon lion's head

289
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
is too big.

290
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
This is not a lion.

291
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's a lion.

292
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Lion?

293
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The lion eats meat.

294
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
There are so many dead animals.

295
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It eats well and grows big.

296
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It must have a chicken's body

297
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
when it's eating the food.

298
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And it must be very small.

299
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Will the lion eat living people?

300
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
If this thing is normal size,

301
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
it will definitely not bite people.

302
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But it's so big now.

303
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I really don't know if it will bite people.

304
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But the lion lives in a place where there are many dead people.

305
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It won't come and go often.

306
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Why are there so many people moving at the same time?

307
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I think

308
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
they were running away just now.

309
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Running away?

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I always feel that there seems to be something

311
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
inside that is pulling us over.

312
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And the speed is not small.

313
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Where is the lion?

314
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It is about to open its mouth.

315
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It is quite big.

316
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It is about to open its mouth.

317
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So I will open it.

318
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Open it.

319
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Open it.

320
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Open it.

321
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Open it.

322
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Open it.

323
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Open it.

324
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Open it.

325
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Open it.

326
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Open it.

327
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Little Third Master,

328
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
hold this.

329
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's coming.

330
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What is it?

331
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Isn't it just a drop of water?

332
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It scared you to death.

333
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Don't shout.

334
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I was scared to death.

335
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
No leather.

336
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Did you see anything?

337
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
No.

338
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
If it was a group of bandits,

339
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I could have seen and seen one.

340
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
We don't even know

341
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
what this is.

342
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This light is getting dimmer.

343
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I think it's a sign that

344
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
the bandits are coming.

345
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I don't know.

346
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Don't worry about what it is.

347
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The important thing now

348
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
is to get out.

349
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But we are in a flood.

350
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
If we go back,

351
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
it won't be as easy as when we came in.

352
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Little Brother, what do you think?

353
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
If we go out now,

354
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm afraid it's too late.

355
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Since those two people

356
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
let us in,

357
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
we must be very sure.

358
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
We can't go out.

359
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
How about this?

360
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
If we go forward, it's not easy.

361
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
We'll go back.

362
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The way in is not complicated.

363
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
We should be able to get out.

364
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If we encounter anything strange,

365
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
we'll just keep watching.

366
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It seems like this is the only way.

367
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Pan Zi, you go back.

368
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'll go forward.

369
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
We'll go out together.

370
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Get the boat out.

371
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Little Brother, please

372
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
help us find a way out.

373
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Third Master, the engine was broken by them.

374
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's completely broken.

375
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's too bad. It can't move at all.

376
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's stuck here.

377
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It could be stuck anytime.

378
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That old thief

379
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
is really something.

380
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The land-to-land river is getting lower and lower.

381
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Our boat is too wide.

382
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
There's no way to get out.

383
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Let's go.

384
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Wu Xun!

385
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Wu Xun!

386
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Wu Xun!

387
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's late. Let's go.

388
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Wu Xun!

389
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Wu Xun!

390
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Wu Xun!

391
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Wu Xun!

392
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Wu Xun!

393
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Wu Xun!

394
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Wu Xun!

395
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Wu Xun!

396
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Wu Xun!

397
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Wu Xun!

398
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Wu Xun!

399
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Wu Xun!

400
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Wu Xun!

401
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Wu Xun!

402
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Wu Xun!

403
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
What's that?

404
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Let go of me!

405
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Wu Xun!

406
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Who are you?

407
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Let go.

408
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,960
You...

409
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Oh, God.

410
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Hold on.

411
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
What's that?

412
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
That bedding.

413
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
He's dead.

414
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Oh, no.

415
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,720
Looks like the ship's going to leave us here.

416
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,720
After we're dead, they'll take our stuff.

417
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,520
I don't know what happened today.

418
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,520
They actually died in the hands of that big corpse.

419
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,080
A corpse's claws, no matter how powerful they are,

420
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,080
they can't just tear someone into two pieces.

421
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,480
I think they're a perfect match.

422
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,440
But that big corpse was just trying to poison half of his body.

423
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
That's why he got the bullet.

424
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Fatty, pull me.

425
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Are you okay?

426
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,920
Little Third Master, are you okay?

427
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,440
I'm sorry about earlier.

428
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,120
It's okay. I'm fine.

429
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,520
You're fine?

430
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
You're lucky to be alive.

431
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,040
Little Brother, with such a big corpse,

432
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,440
you pulled out that intestine.

433
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,840
I'm so happy for you.

434
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,880
What intestine?

435
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,720
That's called the central nervous system.

436
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,340
Little Brother, once you've done it, you'll turn that insect into a

437
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,400
mess.

438
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,000
What? He's not dead yet?

439
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Let's kill him then.

440
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Hey, stop.

441
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,560
We can't kill him yet.

442
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,760
We need to get him out of that cave.

443
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,760
That sound was coming from the corpse's tail.

444
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Why is there a bell on his tail?

445
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,720
Could it be that someone raised this corpse?

446
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Why would we raise him?

447
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,120
This bell is used to bewitch people.

448
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,320
This bell looks a bit old.

449
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,520
It's been so many years and it's still making sounds.

450
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
It's really quite amazing.

451
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,920
Judging from the texture, this must be made by Qing Tong.

452
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
But judging from the light,

453
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,120
it must be made by the crystal.

454
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
You're so annoying!

455
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,720
What are you doing? You're a beast!

456
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Can't you be more honest?

457
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
This thing is a magical instrument.

458
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,520
You just stepped on it and ruined it.

459
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,320
Third Uncle,

460
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,120
I'm not saying that he did it on purpose.

461
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,520
He must have been affected by the sound.

462
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,520
Don't be angry.

463
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
This green water is so stinky.

464
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
The red light.

465
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,320
This green water is from the body of the martial arts.

466
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Third Uncle, what is this pipe that's going to the corpse?

467
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,920
It's a co-existence system.

468
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
It's really magical.

469
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,320
Third Uncle, what's going on?

470
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,920
The empty ball of the martial arts can connect the corpse's stomach.

471
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,920
Once it's hungry, it can eat through this pipe into the corpse's stomach.

472
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
This way,

473
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,920
the martial arts can survive forever.

474
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,920
So disgusting.

475
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
What do you know?

476
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
I don't know which martial arts expert

477
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,920
would have made such a thing.

478
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,520
It's just that,

479
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,520
to let this thing survive here,

480
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
is it really for

481
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,520
protecting something inside?

482
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
We'll put this corpse on the boat later.

483
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,520
Let it go.

484
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
This thing eats the corpse here.

485
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,920
It's very toxic.

486
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,920
It's the king of the cave.

487
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,520
If it stays on the boat,

488
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
we can definitely get out.

489
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,520
We can't just look back.

490
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
I want to see

491
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,520
what kind of place is ahead.

492
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,520
How can it raise such a special bug?

493
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,120
How can it raise such a special bug?

494
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Everyone, go out quickly.

495
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
We have to get out earlier.

496
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Hurry and go out.

497
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
I don't want to wait a second.

498
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,120
Third Uncle,

499
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,120
look at this whole stone wall.

500
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
How did the ancient people of the society

501
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
come up with this?

502
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
Even if it's now,

503
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
I'm afraid that not many people

504
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,120
can dig out such a deep cave.

505
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,120
This cave should be very old.

506
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
The people who dug this cave

507
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
are probably

508
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
from the ancient times.

509
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
They are the people who dug this cave.

510
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
They are the people who dug this cave.

511
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,120
They are the people who dug this cave.

512
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
It should be the Kuan Island.

513
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,120
The Kuan Island is a special army for the islanders.

514
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,120
It seems that if we want to find the tomb we want to find,

515
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,120
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

516
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,120
Third Uncle,

517
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
how can you be so sure that

518
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,120
there must be a tomb here?

519
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,120
They brought the army here.

520
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
And they dug such a long hole.

521
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Maybe a lot of things here

522
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,120
have been moved away by them.

523
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,120
If this island was really

524
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,120
moved away by them 1000 years ago,

525
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
I have nothing to say.

526
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,120
But look.

527
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,120
This cave does

528
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
exist on the map.

529
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
What does this mean?

530
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,120
It means that this cave

531
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,120
already existed

532
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,120
before the ancient tomb owner died.

533
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,120
Looking at the year of this cave,

534
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,120
it should be before the ancient tomb

535
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,120
we are looking for.

536
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
I'm sure that

537
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
there is definitely more than one tomb here.

538
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,120
Who knows when this cave was dug?

539
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
That means

540
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
everything we encounter now,

541
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,120
including huge stone walls,

542
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,120
and that

543
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,120
six-legged bronze bell,

544
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,120
their owners

545
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,120
are even earlier than the time of the war.

546
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,120
I'm not really concerned about that.

547
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,120
What I'm concerned about now is

548
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,120
why this tomb owner

549
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,120
has to bury himself

550
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
next to a tomb that has been stolen.

551
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Isn't that a big mistake?

552
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,120
Master San,

553
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,120
look.

554
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,120
It's the first time.

555
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,120
The front is the most dangerous part of the cave.

556
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
This cave is the first time

557
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,120
I've ever seen it.

558
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Is the light in front of us

559
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
because of a lot of corpses?

560
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Pan Zi, here.

561
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Master San.

562
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,120
If there is a real corpse cave in front of us,

563
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
then we will definitely be in danger.

564
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
It's very likely that the ghosts are fighting.

565
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
It's also very likely that hundreds of water ghosts

566
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
are coming to our ship.

567
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,120
The first time I saw a corpse cave in front of us,

568
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
I was very surprised.

569
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,120
I was very surprised.

570
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,120
I was very surprised.

571
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,120
I was very surprised.

572
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,120
I was very surprised.

573
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,120
I was very surprised.

574
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,120
I was very surprised.

575
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,120
I was very surprised.

576
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,120
I was very surprised.

577
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,120
I was very surprised.

578
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,120
I was very surprised.

579
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,120
I was very surprised.

580
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
I was very surprised.

581
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,120
I was very surprised.

582
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,120
There are so many dead bodies.

583
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,120
There are so many dead bodies.

584
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Don't get surprised.

585
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Have you ever seen them?

586
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,120
No, I haven't.

587
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,120
Then why are you so calm?

588
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,120
What can we do if I'm not calm?

589
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,120
We can't turn back now.

590
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,120
No matter what happens after this,

591
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,120
we must go forward together.

592
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,120
we must go forward together.

593
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,120
You guys, be careful.

594
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:56,400
There are more than only

595
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,320
Hey..

596
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,420
Look,

597
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,720
there is a crystal coffin over there.

598
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,620
There's a corpse inside, I think.

599
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,320
There's another too.

600
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,520
Why is it empty?

601
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,320
Where should we go?

602
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,260

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,840
