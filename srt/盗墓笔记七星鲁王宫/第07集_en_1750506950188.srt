1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
searched

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm really sorry.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I just looked it up.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's okay.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Just cut that fat man a bit.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And kowtow.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
kowtow to your screen.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm afraid you're not the same Wang Fatty.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Uncle Xia,

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
did you see it wrong?

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I didn't see it wrong.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I saw it wrong.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is a trap.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Third Master!

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm afraid it's you.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm afraid it's you.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm afraid it's you.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm afraid it's you.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm afraid it's you.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm afraid it's you.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Uncle Xia,

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
you're not calling me?

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't be afraid.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll wait for you from now on.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No matter it's a day,

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
ten years,

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
or a hundred years, I'll wait.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Until you die,

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
or I die.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Whatever it is, kill me!

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Third Master!

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Fatty, what are you doing?

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Stop it!

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What are you doing?

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Come on, this is not your game.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is not your game.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're a fool.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why did you invite me to the field?

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Why did you invite me?

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:44,340
You're under the spell of the

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't know either.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Then what is this box for?

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is the silver and silver deer top

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
in the eight treasures.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't understand.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This is the last one

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
in the eight boxes of the Sheli Zi.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But this thing

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
is obviously much smaller

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
than that silver deer top.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
When it was a war,

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Buddhism had not yet

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
entered China.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Besides, it's not

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Sheli Zi in here.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Could it be that

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
it's the blood of

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
King of Lushan?

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Then open it and take a look.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Come on.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This key

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
should be for this box.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Wu Xie.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Why don't you open it?

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You're stupid.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There was a female lion

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
with a female chicken in it.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If we open this box

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and run into any kind of mechanism,

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
we'll all die.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes, yes, yes.

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm stupid.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm stupid.

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I...

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's go back and study it.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Aomenshimpujing Entertainment City 772772.com

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The most exciting PG game on the line.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The mahjong is over.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The mahjong is over 2.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The prize-winning queen

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
is looking for a golden city.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The super high rate of compensation

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
for the talented cat,

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the prize-winning captain,

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and so on.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The prize-winning rate is high.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There are many opportunities for revenge.

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hurry up and join.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Aomenshimpujing Entertainment City 772772.com

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I have to find her first

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and leave this place.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What's going on?

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't know either.

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Do you two see anything special

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
in the tomb?

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why should I tell you?

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's right.

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
There are many dangerous people in this tomb.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you two want to save Wu Xie,

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
we can cooperate.

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're dreaming.

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
How can we

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
be in the same boat

135
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
with you thieves?

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We don't steal cultural relics.

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What are you joking about?

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If I don't take cultural relics,

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
can we cooperate?

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Liu Tai.

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The premise is

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
you two help me save Ning.

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Or at least help me repair the equipment

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
so that we can contact her.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Ning?

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Think about it.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Is there anything strange

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
going on in the tomb?

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There are so many holes here.

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Every hole

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
is connected to this big tree.

152
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Where is the way to get out of here?

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The blood is coming.

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, my god.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He's so bold.

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's Xiaoqi.

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What are you doing?

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm going down.

159
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You can't get out of here.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Go away.

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Xiaoqi, you're so good.

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're fighting.

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Nice.

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Xiaoqi, come on.

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Xiaoqi, come on.

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Xiaoqi, come on.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Xiaoqi, you're so good.

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Come on.

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Xiaoqi.

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, no.

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Xiaoqi, I'll kill you.

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't go. It's dangerous.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He'll kill you.

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Let go.

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Go.

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Wu Xie.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Xiaoqi, I'll kill you.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Xiaoqi.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Come on.

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Xiaoqi.

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Xiaoqi.

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Xiaoqi.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Xiaoqi.

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Xiaoqi.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Xiaoqi.

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Xiaoqi.

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You.

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll buy you.

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm so tired.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,840
Father, I got his Esti second track

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,280
on which I could

192
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,000
find out about something ici.

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Father,

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,200
Where's the recording ofwar?

195
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
It's not to me.

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You know that, right?

197
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,420
Hmm

198
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,640
Someone is already dead in Seven Stars Calligraphy

199
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,820
Now tell me, what else?

200
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,100
You're not going to steal even your coffin

201
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,920
You're not in the right place

202
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
so what are you guys trying to do?

203
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,580
None of your business

204
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,780
You two should use this place to restore the equipment

205
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,080
If not, you could still الحrer

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:10:14,860
It seems like the fire is made up.

207
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:51,400
I found the

208
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,220
Okay

209
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,060
The medicine

210
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,420
Look

211
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,300
Look

212
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,880
Can you see

213
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,420
Ah?

214
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,880
You.

215
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,760
I was scared.

216
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,640
You were quite severe.

217
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,040
You can actuallyстаught lyrics nicely.

218
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,900
Killing one's own person is really miserable.

219
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,860
Is it the poison House blood?

220
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,000
The poison House blood?

221
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,880
He vomited blood and woke up.

222
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
He should be fine.

223
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,880
Xiao Qi, I am An Ning.

224
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
An Ning.

225
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
An Ning.

226
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Wu Xie.

227
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Wu Xie.

228
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Wu Xie, how do you feel?

229
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Xiao Ge.

230
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
What should we do now?

231
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Why did you become like this, Xiao Qi?

232
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Dong Zi and I...

233
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
We have been in the same room.

234
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,880
But I drank the water there.

235
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,880
I had a hallucination.

236
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Dong Zi is lying on the west side.

237
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Don't go.

238
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
It's dangerous.

239
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Xiao Qi.

240
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,880
Xiao Ge.

241
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Xiao Ge.

242
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
Don't worry, Qi Lin Jie.

243
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Or I will kill you.

244
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
What are you doing?

245
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Stop it, go and drop the gun.

246
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
This is Qi Lin Jie.

247
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
What is Qi Lin Jie?

248
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Miss An Ning.

249
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
What do you want Qi Lin Jie for?

250
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,280
I want to save my partner.

251
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,360
You're crazy. Your partner is already dead.

252
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,280
Shut up!

253
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,680
Use the Qilin knot to exchange your life.

254
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,480
We saved your life.

255
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,680
You haven't paid it back yet.

256
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,080
I'll shoot when you count to three.

257
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,280
One.

258
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,680
Hey, is this woman for real?

259
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,480
Two.

260
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,080
Let her go.

261
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,480
I'll help you find other partners.

262
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,280
I told you.

263
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,880
You're the one who saved us.

264
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,280
You're the one who's the most vicious.

265
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,680
Ming Ping.

266
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,880
Hey.

267
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Ming Ping.

268
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Ming Ping.

269
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Ming Ping.

270
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
Ming Ping.

271
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
Ming Ping.

272
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Ming Ping.

273
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,480
Ming Ping, where are you going?

274
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,280
Help her find someone.

275
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,480
Don't worry, Wang Guixi. With Xiao Ge's skills,

276
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,680
she'll return safely.

277
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,880
Come.

278
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,280
What did that Ming Ping give me to eat?

279
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,880
Third Master, what is this Qilin knot?

280
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,480
Qilin knot?

281
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,280
Qilin knot is actually a very expensive Chinese medicine.

282
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,680
The longer you put it in, the better it will work.

283
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Qilin knot is used to make a corpse.

284
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,480
The Qilin knot you ate earlier, from the color,

285
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,680
I'm afraid it's been a few thousand years.

286
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Xiao Ge's blood can remove those bugs.

287
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,080
I think she's eaten that thousand-year-old Qilin knot.

288
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
It's so deep.

289
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,680
No wonder that woman just now

290
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,480
was determined to grab that thing.

291
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,880
Wu Xie is fine now.

292
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,280
But Cheng Cheng is still in danger.

293
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,880
We should find a way to get out of here quickly.

294
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,880
It's not easy to get out of here.

295
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,680
If we want to go back from the original route,

296
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,080
I'm afraid it's not possible.

297
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,680
Look at these cliff entrances.

298
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,280
They're all connected to the underground maze.

299
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,680
It's not easy to get out of there.

300
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,480
The only way to get out now

301
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,080
is to climb out of this tree.

302
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,880
Look.

303
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,880
The top of this tree should be very close to the ground.

304
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,080
When we get there, we'll just make a hole and we can get out.

305
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,080
And these ten-mantra trees are connected to the top of the cave.

306
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,680
It's just a natural ladder.

307
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,280
I'm fine.

308
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,880
But Pan Zi is injured. He has to climb out of the tree.

309
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,080
I can do it. I can climb.

310
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,080
What about An Ning?

311
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,280
Wu Xie, you're still thinking about that woman?

312
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,680
Let me tell you. You didn't know when you were running over.

313
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,480
That woman was pointing at Pan Zi's head with a gun.

314
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,880
She insisted on changing the Qilin knot.

315
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,280
I think An Ning must have her own reasons.

316
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,680
Forget it. She didn't really want to kill me.

317
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,080
Who said I was a fool?

318
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,280
You two have guns in your heads.

319
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,480
She just wanted to scare us to save her friend.

320
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,680
Okay, okay.

321
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,280
Fatty, I really didn't expect

322
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,280
that you care about my little life.

323
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,080
Because I love you.

324
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,280
Okay, okay.

325
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,680
After all, An Ning has saved Wu Xie.

326
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,280
If she really wants to kill Wu Xie, she won't show mercy.

327
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,880
Yes, yes. You're right.

328
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,880
Fatty.

329
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,280
Why are you all looking at me?

330
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,080
Don't look at me. I'm not helping.

331
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,280
Help, help, help.

332
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,480
An Ning,

333
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,080
go up with us.

334
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,280
Do you really think you can get out alive?

335
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,480
Before I came down,

336
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,880
I was already prepared.

337
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,480
You should plan for yourself.

338
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,480
No.

339
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
You have to go up with us.

340
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,080
You have to go up with us.

341
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,280
Because Haishao and Cheng Cheng Cheng are still in your hands.

342
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,480
Miss An Ning,

343
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,480
we saw some mercenaries on our way here.

344
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,680
They should be your people.

345
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,680
Because they have some equipment that we can use,

346
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,480
so we took them down.

347
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,880
I think you're their leader. You should be responsible for them.

348
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,680
Go and take a look.

349
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,880
How is it going, Haishao?

350
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,280
Who told you to chat?

351
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,680
I'm telling you.

352
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,480
If you want to repair the equipment again, I'll throw you all here.

353
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,280
I have plenty of time for you to chat.

354
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,080
You have to give me time to repair it.

355
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
I'm working on it.

356
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,280
How much longer?

357
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,680
How would we know?

358
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Big Brother, let me tell you the truth.

359
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,880
We haven't eaten for a long time.

360
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Our brains are slow and need energy.

361
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,280
You can let us do our work,

362
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,880
but you have to give us some snacks.

363
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,280
Drink some water.

364
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,080
How can I get up there?

365
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,080
Who's that?

366
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,680
You already drank water?

367
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,180
You have to show up at a time like this.

368
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,980
You can't just sleep with us again.

369
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,680
These are all good things.

370
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
It's a pity.

371
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,080
Even if the equipment is still good,

372
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,200
if you don't have any experience, you can only come here to die.

373
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,080
These are all their guns.

374
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,320
How are they?

375
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,480
None of them are alive.

376
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
How did they die?

377
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,360
Miss An Ning, don't ask anymore.

378
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,240
They are all loyal.

379
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Don't be too sad.

380
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,520
Maybe some of them have already escaped.

381
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,400
If you go up there again, don't come to the tomb again.

382
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,120
We are not here to steal cultural relics.

383
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,240
Then what are you here for?

384
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,560
We have other people.

385
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,560
Can we not brag?

386
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,720
You are such a big group of people. You are wearing all the weapons and came to this tomb.

387
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,520
You still say that you are not here to steal the tomb.

388
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,440
Can't you say that you are here to play with me and come to the tomb?

389
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,080
Fatty, don't brag anymore.

390
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,600
This is A1K971.

391
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,840
A1K971 is 74 points heavier than A1K.

392
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,160
It has increased by 15% to 20%.

393
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:21,280
Everyone's

394
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,480
Hey, don't move.

395
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,120
Third Uncle, what's going on?

396
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,920
So the real coffin is here.

397
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,520
Good guy.

398
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,320
Such a big coffin must be very valuable.

399
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,720
Valuable, valuable.

400
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
How come you have so much money in your head?

401
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
Can you move such a big one out?

402
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,320
Also, have you forgotten our purpose this time?

403
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,120
Protect the treasure.

404
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,320
Yes, yes, yes.

405
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,120
How many times have I told you?

406
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,520
This thing is called a coffin, not a coffin.

407
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,120
Don't always lose face.

408
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,520
A coffin, a coffin.

409
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,320
I was wondering,

410
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,120
why did they come up with another one?

411
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,320
The seven-star coffin and that one,

412
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,520
how many of them are there?

413
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,720
Which one is real?

414
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,120
The old maid, Lu Shang Wang,

415
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
is really a thief.

416
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,120
This tomb is actually in the tree.

417
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,320
How was this machine designed?

418
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,920
Little Third Uncle,

419
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,120
let's not look at this machine first.

420
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,520
Is it really Lu Shang Wang?

421
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,320
Whether he is Lu Shang Wang or not,

422
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
we have guns and cannons now.

423
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,720
Even if Lu Shang Wang climbs up,

424
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,320
we can just kill him.

425
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,320
Wu Xie, what is written on it?

426
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,720
I don't understand either.

427
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,320
But I can confirm

428
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,920
that the owner of this coffin

429
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,120
is the Lu Shang Wang we are looking for.

430
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
The record of his death

431
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,120
is the same as what we know.

432
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,520
This Lu Shang Wang died at the age of 40.

433
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,120
No child, no daughter.

434
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,120
This hole

435
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,120
doesn't look like it was cracked by itself.

436
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,720
It looks like these chains pulled it out.

437
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,520
Then,

438
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
who can tell me

439
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
what this is?

440
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,920
This is a piece of paper.

441
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,920
This is not right. This is very strange.

442
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,120
Other people's coffins or coffin

443
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,920
are all targeted from the outside

444
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
and not allowed to be opened.

445
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,320
But this is too strange.

446
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Look at the mechanism on the stage.

447
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,320
They directly sent this coffin out.

448
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,920
It looks like the owner of this tomb

449
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,320
deliberately asked the successor

450
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,320
to open this coffin.

451
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,120
These chains are tied so tightly.

452
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,320
It doesn't look like it's used to fix it.

453
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,520
It looks like they didn't want the things inside to come out

454
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,720
so they tied it up.

455
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,320
Look here.

456
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,720
There are words here too.

457
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,520
Little Third Master, what does this say?

458
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,720
This should be a flag.

459
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,920
The record on this is a certain time.

460
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,720
But I don't know what this day is for.

461
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
Could it be the time to open the coffin?

462
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Don't talk nonsense.

463
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,320
How could anyone write the time to open the coffin on the coffin?

464
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,720
Did you hear that? What's going on?

465
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,120
Could it be that there's something alive inside?

466
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,320
You're so big. Stop scaring us.

467
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
How could it be?

468
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,120
The coffin is so tightly sealed.

469
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,520
There's no air at all.

470
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,720
Even if there's really someone inside, it's been a thousand years.

471
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,920
It's hard to live.

472
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,920
Why don't we just open it?

473
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,320
No, Third Uncle.

474
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,720
Man You Ping said before that we can't touch anything inside.

475
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
Not to mention that this is a coffin.

476
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,120
The most important thing now is to hurry up and go up.

477
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,320
Cheng Cheng Cheng and Hai Zhao are still in danger.

478
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,520
Wu Xie, just because of this,

479
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,720
we should open it and take a look.

480
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,520
Actually, I just said to go up. That was just my guess.

481
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,720
If it's different from what I thought,

482
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,120
when we're in trouble, I'm afraid that even Third Uncle can't protect you.

483
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,720
Think about it. There are so many mechanisms here.

484
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,320
What?

485
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,520
This design,

486
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,320
maybe when we open this coffin,

487
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,720
there will be a way and clue to get out of it.

488
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
But Third Uncle...

489
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Wu Xie,

490
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,720
I think what you said is right.

491
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,120
You think that we should hurry up and go out.

492
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,920
But if you think like that,

493
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,920
what if we open this thing,

494
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,120
and find the clue to get out of here?

495
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,320
You think that climbing trees isn't a simple thing, right?

496
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Plus,

497
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,520
don't we still have a mall here?

498
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,120
Brother, can you stop looking at us while we eat?

499
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,520
This will affect my appetite.

500
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,120
Chu Bei Liang didn't eat for nothing.

501
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,720
If we can't get the equipment ready after we eat,

502
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
you two should know very well

503
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,520
what kind of consequences will come.

504
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,720
You eat, Uncle Wu.

505
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,520
Now we have reached the first floor.

506
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,120
There are still a few floors left.

507
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,520
We must open one or two more floors to see clearly.

508
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,520
Come, count the numbers.

509
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,120
One, two, three.

510
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Why is it so heavy?

511
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,320
Come.

512
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
You...

513
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,120
Is it that heavy?

514
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,320
So many people can't even push it.

515
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,720
Come, come, come. Come to the side.

516
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,320
Do you have to force me to do it?

517
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,520
Move aside.

518
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,520
Okay?

519
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,320
Can you do it?

520
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,520
If you can't, don't force yourself.

521
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,120
Let's go!

522
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,920
Fatty is indeed amazing.

523
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,120
You can open the wall and push the coffin.

524
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,920
Shao Ye Zi.

525
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Shao Ye Zi.

526
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,920
Good job.

527
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,320
What is the price of this tomb of King of Lushan?

528
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,720
The common tomb of King of Zhuhe

529
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,320
is the third floor of the second floor.

530
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,120
If this tree is the first floor now,

531
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,120
we are now at the second floor of the second floor.

532
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,520
So, the bottom floor is the most valuable.

533
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,120
No, the most valuable.

534
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,920
Isn't it?

535
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,920
This jade is too big.

536
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,720
You rarely see it, right?

537
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,520
This jade is the Xinjiang Manas jade.

538
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,720
What is carved on it is the shadow of the sky and the earth.

539
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,520
A jade this big must be complete

540
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,320
to have its value.

541
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,520
Fatty, take it down.

542
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,320
We don't have much time left.

543
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,120
Have you decided what to do?

544
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,520
The vanguard army hasn't been informed.

545
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,920
We can't wait any longer.

546
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,120
There will be villagers passing by in the dark.

547
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,320
We can't stay here for long.

548
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
You should think about the evacuation.

549
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,920
Stop talking.

550
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,520
I've decided.

551
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,120
The one that's drawn on this

552
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,520
should be the scene when the official came in.

553
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,920
Then, if it's lying here,

554
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,320
it must be King of Lushan himself.

555
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,520
If you want to know if it's King of Lushan,

556
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,320
there's only one way.

557
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,520
Open it and take a look.

558
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,920
Pan Zi,

559
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,320
this is the last coffin.

560
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,920
Let's be more cautious.

561
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,920
There's a lot of people here.

562
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,320
The coffin is here.

563
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,920
Let's be more cautious.

564
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,520
Be more reserved.

565
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,520
It seems like there's a breathing sound.

566
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,120
Can you stop joking?

567
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,720
That person is your Third Uncle, right?

568
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,320
You're used to scaring me, right?

569
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
There's a breathing sound in here.

570
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,320
You think I'm a minor, right?

571
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
You're so funny.

572
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,520
You listen to it.

573
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,320
Be careful.

574
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,720
You said there's one, so there is.

575
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,120
There's no other way.

576
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,520
Are we going to drive the coffin back?

577
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,320
Wu Xie,

578
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,920
don't hesitate.

579
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Remember to shoot.

580
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,920
Pan Zi.

581
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,520
Wait.

582
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,720
Wait.

583
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,120
Put it down.

584
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,520
Do you guys know

585
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
what a man's doing?

586
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,520
It's like a stick.

587
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
We're going to open

588
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,720
the coffin of King of Lushan.

589
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,320
It's been thousands of years.

590
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,520
You're eating a can of shark fin.

591
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,320
You're going to jump?

592
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,920
You're going to jump?

593
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,520
You're going to jump?

594
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,120
You're going to jump?

595
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,120
You're going to jump?

596
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,120
You're kidding.

597
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,320
Do as you're told.

598
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,720
I'll do as I'm told.

599
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,920
Move aside.

600
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,920
Move.

601
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,720
Don't think about it.

602
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,920
He's carrying a baby.

603
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,920
Don't destroy it.

604
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,720
I thought it was a seed again.

605
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,320
It may be a baby.

606
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,280
It's just baby.

607
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,320
Can someone put a can of shark fin in it?

608
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,320
We're getting high again.

609
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,720
We don't really have anything else to do.

610
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,520
Useless thing.

611
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,520
I'm a poor guy.

612
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,120
You brothers,

613
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,920
should all be careful.

614
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,320
We won't kill the giant stone tortoise with you.

615
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,120
Why don't you go along with him?

616
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,720
You are so rude.

617
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:39,620
Are you здесь for recuer

618
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,620
What is the purpose?

619
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,620
It's to put these things on.

620
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,620
Maybe it can help us get back our old self.

621
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,620
You really want this?

622
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,620
Old man, do you know how to take this thing off?

623
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,620
I heard that this thing can't be taken off from outside.

624
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,620
Do we have to take it out?

625
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,620
You're here again?

626
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,620
I told you that you guys don't have any skills.

627
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,620
You can't just carry it or take it off.

628
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,620
Can you think of a way to take it off?

629
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:23,620
I'm just saying, of course we have to carry it off.

630
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,620
How do we take it off? You take it off from the top.
