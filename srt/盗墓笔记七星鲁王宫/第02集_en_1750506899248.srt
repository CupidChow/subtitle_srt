1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm not a good singer

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm not a good singer

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not a good singer

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm not a good singer

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not a good singer

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm not a good singer

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not a good singer

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm not a good singer

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not a good singer

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not a good singer

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not a good singer

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm not a good singer

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not a good singer

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm not a good singer

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not a good singer

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not a good singer

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not a good singer

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not a good singer

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not a good singer

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,100
Call me Waters

21
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,100
Call me Waters

22
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,100
Call me Waters

23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,100
Call me Waters

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Call me waters

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Call me waters

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,820
The

27
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,820
The

28
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,820
The

29
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
The

30
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
The

31
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
The

32
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
The

33
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
The

34
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,820
The

35
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
The

36
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,980
The

37
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,980
The

38
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,980
The

39
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,980
The

40
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,980
The

41
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,980
The

42
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,980
The

43
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,980
The

44
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,980
I can't tell you about this.

45
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,260
What does your aunt do?

46
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,260
Is Nan Wen Sheng also an archaeologist?

47
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,740
You're so smart! You guessed it right!

48
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,900
When I was very young,

49
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,820
my aunt went out to explore the archaeology.

50
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
Later, I also learned about archaeology.

51
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,740
A few days ago, when I was checking the documents left by my aunt,

52
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,740
I discovered this book.

53
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,740
Okay, done!

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,740
Move aside.

55
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,740
Wu Xie, now that the two books are combined,

56
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,740
can you see anything?

57
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,740
Okay.

58
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,740
After reading the books for so long, can you see anything?

59
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,740
The West's five-leaf-leaf painting,

60
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,740
the earliest female character, Ya.

61
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,740
I've read the words.

62
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,740
Still no clue.

63
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
Then, what did she say?

64
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,740
I just don't understand what she means.

65
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,740
I have to go out. Third Uncle is looking for me.

66
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,740
Nine o'clock. Chicken-eyes, yellow sand, dragon, a few times, come quickly.

67
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,740
What does that mean?

68
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,740
Third Uncle's secret language, the new goods have arrived.

69
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,740
Dragon cup is a good thing.

70
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
It should be a precious cultural relic.

71
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,740
My third uncle has a high opinion.

72
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,740
He said it's a good thing. I have to go and see.

73
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,740
Excuse me, let me ask you.

74
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
What does your third uncle do?

75
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,740
He has a lot of research on those words and secret languages.

76
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,740
What kind of life does he study? Maybe he can understand.

77
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,740
If there's anything, let's talk about it later.

78
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,740
Dragon cup, dragon cup.

79
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,740
Big brother, take the money.

80
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Calm down. Calm down.

81
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,740
I'll pay you. I'll pay you.

82
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,740
Don't come over.

83
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,740
I'll pay you. I'll pay you.

84
00:04:41,740 --> 00:05:04,540
Annie like a

85
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,980
School university

86
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,140
Fun So- stressed game

87
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,360
There are more than three thousand over there.

88
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,540
Pretty much everything.

89
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,560
One hundred.

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
Just two hundred?

91
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,260
I'll get it for you

92
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,380
later.

93
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,860
observing the situation...

94
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,740
Enjoy yourself.

95
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,180
You must be tired from all the thinking I cried,

96
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,480
to get all the Halls puisse...

97
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,740
I surely am,

98
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,780
I won't forget.

99
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,920
How large of a trouble this is!

100
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,880
You're talk was sufficient.

101
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,320
Brother, thank you.

102
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,360
Uncle, do you know that person?

103
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,840
I met him for the first time. A friend of a friend.

104
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,920
Look. Do you see?

105
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,840
The good thing on his back.

106
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,200
It just arrived today.

107
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,240
What is it?

108
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
A ancient weapon.

109
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,480
You let him take it so easily?

110
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,560
I came here specifically to see him.

111
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,240
You still have the nerve to say it?

112
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,520
What time is it now? I said 9.30. You brat.

113
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,720
Forget it. Forget it.

114
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,320
Uncle, you must have sold a lot of money for this dragon flag.

115
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,560
No. I'm a friend of Kuizeng.

116
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,920
I'm not selling cultural relics.

117
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,760
Kuizeng?

118
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,160
You think I would believe you?

119
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,400
You brat.

120
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
You haven't seen anyone for a while.

121
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,080
Where have you been these days?

122
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,800
This is not as good as you.

123
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,640
You are a god.

124
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,280
We are almost in contact through the single-line.

125
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,240
Let me tell you.

126
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,120
Old Luo called me today.

127
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
He said you went to see him.

128
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,400
But there is a scar on your arm.

129
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,600
I want to ask you. What did you do?

130
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,520
Nothing. I just bumped into him.

131
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
You still want to lie to me?

132
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
You brat, tell me honestly.

133
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,080
Did you go to Germany to protect the cultural relics?

134
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,280
No. How could I?

135
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,880
You think your Third Uncle is so easy to be fooled?

136
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,400
Let me tell you. I can guess it.

137
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
You can think it out.

138
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,880
If you have anything to say,

139
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,280
I have the nerve to go to see your parents.

140
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,880
Third Uncle.

141
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,080
Look, I completed my mission.

142
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,280
I am very active. I gave the item to the country.

143
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,800
Third Uncle.

144
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,880
I have something here. I want you to see it.

145
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,480
I don't want to see it.

146
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,480
Third Uncle.

147
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,880
Yes. It's my luck.

148
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,080
Third Uncle, what is this?

149
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,280
Just help me see it.

150
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,680
I said I don't want to see it.

151
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,480
Third Uncle, just look.

152
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,280
Third Uncle.

153
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
...

154
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,440
How did you get this?

155
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,000
Third Uncle.

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,400
Didn't we agree on the rules and not question Chuchu?

157
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,400
How is it? What's the case?

158
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,120
It's like a map of a dog's territory.

159
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Where did you get such a good thing?

160
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Why can't I ever meet it?

161
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
This time, it's really a good luck.

162
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Third Uncle,

163
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,280
I can still tell the difference between this and the picture.

164
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Don't fool me.

165
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
You brat, what do you know?

166
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,280
This is called calligraphy.

167
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,280
It's to write out the location of the place in detail.

168
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
This calligraphy,

169
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
people really don't understand.

170
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,280
But fortunately, your Third Uncle is also a bit experienced.

171
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,280
In this world,

172
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
people who can understand this,

173
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
except for your Third Uncle and me,

174
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
I'm afraid it's not more than ten people.

175
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Third Uncle,

176
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
is it written here,

177
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
go left and then go right,

178
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
see the big tree in front, turn right,

179
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,280
see a well and then go down?

180
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Isn't that so?

181
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,280
It's really so uneducated.

182
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
I say, why is your understanding so poor?

183
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,280
It seems that our Wu family has finished playing with you.

184
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
No one taught me at all.

185
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,280
This ability is not born.

186
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
Third Uncle,

187
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
how do you see this thing?

188
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,280
I can't see it completely right now.

189
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,280
But it should be a noble family from the Lu State during the war.

190
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Because the place where his tomb is,

191
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
was written on this book.

192
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
I think he's a very high-ranking person.

193
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
And this tomb,

194
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,280
must be very secretive.

195
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
It's a good hole, worth a try.

196
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
I haven't finished reading it yet.

197
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
I advise you to give up this idea.

198
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Let me take a look.

199
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
No, I say,

200
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
you little rascal, why are you like this?

201
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
You can tell me when you need me.

202
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
When you don't need me, you don't let me take a look.

203
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
First Uncle,

204
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
this is a tomb of the war country.

205
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
There are some magical weapons inside.

206
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
Don't you want to take a look?

207
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
No,

208
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
I won't go down anyway.

209
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
You don't want to go down either.

210
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
No matter if this tomb is a noble family tomb,

211
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
or a common tomb,

212
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
as long as it's an ancient tomb map,

213
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
it should be handed over to the Cultural and Cultural Affairs Protection Administration.

214
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
Where is this going?

215
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
No answer.

216
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
I'll get it.

217
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
What's taking so long?

218
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
What happened?

219
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
You left for a while,

220
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
and some men suddenly came in

221
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
and took Uncle Bo away, do you know that?

222
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
Uncle Bo?

223
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Dad, mom, I have handed the relics to the relics protection agency.

224
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,280
But I seem to have caused a bigger trouble.

225
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,280
But I don't think I did anything wrong.

226
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,280
When I was studying in Germany, I once saw many relics of our country in the museum.

227
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,280
When my German classmate was looking at the relics, I didn't know how to explain

228
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:20,280
why our relics would appear here.

229
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:27,280
My grandpa might have a reason to sell the relics to the relics dealers.

230
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,280
But now more people are only doing it for the benefit.

231
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,280
They want to leave us forever with these beautiful things.

232
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,280
I decided to do my best to protect the relics.

233
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,280
I won't let those relics dealers and thieves have any chance.

234
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Don't worry. I won't let them destroy the relics.

235
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,280
I won't let them hurt the people around me.

236
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,280
I will definitely do it. I will.

237
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Wu Xie, these men didn't hurt us.

238
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,280
They just took the relics and left. They didn't ask about anything else.

239
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,280
I don't think it's as bad as you think.

240
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,280
They are also very cautious and dare not do anything. Am I right?

241
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,280
It's all my fault. Otherwise, you wouldn't have been in danger.

242
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Actually, you don't have to feel guilty. I know you can't let it go.

243
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,280
So, the three of us should discuss the solution together.

244
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,280
If those men are really the thieves,

245
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,280
they have so many tricks. We can find their identity, right?

246
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,280
You are right.

247
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,280
I can't just sit and do nothing.

248
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,280
I lost the relics because of me. I should take responsibility.

249
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,280
It's all my fault. If I didn't have to take the relics together,

250
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,280
they wouldn't have been able to find the relics.

251
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Actually, I have a good idea.

252
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:25,240
If the three of us find the relics first before the

253
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,240
we find the relics,

254
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,240
we can find the relics.

255
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
I think it's not easy.

256
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,240
We have to deal with the overseas thieves.

257
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,240
It's already a blessing for us to be able to bring Uncle Bo back from Germany alive.

258
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,240
It's okay. Don't you still have your third uncle?

259
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,240
My third uncle? No, no.

260
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
My third uncle is just a local.

261
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Your friend is right, Wu Xie.

262
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
We don't have any evidence.

263
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,240
There's no reason to call the police to arrest us.

264
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,240
I knew you would say that.

265
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
You knew?

266
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Third Uncle, I already thought about it.

267
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,240
It's not appropriate to call the police now.

268
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
This is also because of me.

269
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,240
I can't let the thieves find the relics first.

270
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
That's why I asked you to come out this time.

271
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,240
I think it's best to find the relics first before the we find the relics.

272
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,240
It's the best way to protect the relics together.

273
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,240
I'll help you find the relics.

274
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
That's right.

275
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Then I'll go with you to protect the relics.

276
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
That's right.

277
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
You're quite thoughtful.

278
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
But you hid that Uncle Bo.

279
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
What do you want me to explain?

280
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
Who do you think I am?

281
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
You can hide it as you like.

282
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
You can explain it to me as you like.

283
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
You can treat me like a monkey.

284
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
I'm not happy anymore.

285
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
I'm not looking anymore.

286
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Okay.

287
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Third Uncle.

288
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Don't be like this.

289
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Hey!

290
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Third Uncle.

291
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
I have taken such aomometry to get to here.

292
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,240
Look, I still brought you this.

293
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Hmm?

294
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Hmm?

295
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,560
You're good at this.

296
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,600
Third Uncle, then,

297
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,440
drink while you help me look at this book.

298
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,000
You brat.

299
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,640
Book.

300
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,840
Third Uncle, you must work hard. I'm looking out for you.

301
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,320
Here.

302
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,760
I'm telling you, don't try this with me.

303
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,560
I know that the number of people who can solve this puzzle is less than ten.

304
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,360
So, you hurry and solve it. We'll be ready to set off at any time.

305
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,520
Solving the puzzle is solving the puzzle.

306
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,600
We must pay attention to the matter of your Xia Mu.

307
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,200
Why should we pay attention to it?

308
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,800
I'm definitely going to this tomb.

309
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,000
You think you can't kill me?

310
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,200
I'm not going to kill you.

311
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,800
You think you can't kill me?

312
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,240
Protecting the tomb isn't something that you can protect.

313
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,440
Of course, I can't do it alone.

314
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,480
Isn't this just you and Third Uncle?

315
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,240
This Xia Mu really isn't a joke.

316
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,040
There are no air conditioning in that place.

317
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,240
Also, it's pitch black and there are traps everywhere.

318
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,040
It's possible that you could die anytime, anywhere.

319
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,480
You're the only child in the family.

320
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,520
If you have any problems,

321
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,800
how can I explain it to you?

322
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Just forget it if you don't take me there.

323
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I'll pretend that I didn't say anything.

324
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Da Zhi Zi, you and your friends are staying here.

325
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,640
Don't you still have your Third Uncle?

326
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,240
Third Uncle will help you.

327
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,040
Third Uncle, I'm still not clear about your personal hobby.

328
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,440
Anyway, I'm not at ease that you're going alone.

329
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,840
I'll go with you wherever you go.

330
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,240
The horror of ancient tombstones isn't something you can imagine.

331
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,040
This really isn't a joke.

332
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,680
Fine. Since you're so reluctant,

333
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,680
then let's pretend that nothing happened.

334
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,920
How about this?

335
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,520
Actually, your Third Uncle can handle it alone.

336
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,920
You, don't go.

337
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,280
I promise you that I'll take those cultural relics

338
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,640
from the ancient tomb and return them to the country.

339
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,520
Is that okay?

340
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,920
You think I'll believe you?

341
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,840
Let's continue on how we're doing in the future.

342
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,600
All our problems will be resolved one by one.

343
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,920
Fine then!

344
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,000
Okay. Okay. I promise you to go to the group trip.

345
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
But let me tell you first.

346
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,480
After we enter the school, you must listen to my instructions.

347
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,680
You can't act without permission. Is that okay?

348
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,960
I'll listen to you when I go out.

349
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,760
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

350
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,960
That's good.

351
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,840
Actually, this is the first time I've taken part in such a righteous action.

352
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,280
I'm very proud of myself.

353
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,400
Third Uncle, why did your awareness suddenly improve?

354
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,800
This is a business that doesn't earn money.

355
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:53,240
You don't understand the essence of your third uncle's

356
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,400
I'm not sure if I can do it.

357
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,240
But it's not enough for just the two of us.

358
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,680
Tomorrow, I'm going to find some experienced people to work together.

359
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,520
I have a suitable partner here.

360
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,480
I'll take you to see.

361
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,160
Your friends are not reliable.

362
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,480
Come and see.

363
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,280
Come. Come.

364
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,400
Everyone, come out.

365
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,480
Third Uncle.

366
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,000
Third Uncle.

367
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is Hai Shao. This is Chen Chenchen.

368
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,520
They are both my friends.

369
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,960
If you really want to go to the school, they will go with me.

370
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,240
Third Uncle.

371
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,160
What are you doing?

372
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
What did you say just now?

373
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,400
I said, if we go to the school,

374
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,280
we'll take Hai Shao and Chen Chenchen with us.

375
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,560
Are these your friends?

376
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,000
Yes.

377
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,280
Did you discuss all of this?

378
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,640
No.

379
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,680
Third Uncle.

380
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,680
This book was originally taken by me and Hai Shao.

381
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,880
And the other book is originally Chen Chenchen's.

382
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,920
Anyway, everyone has a share.

383
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,800
What kind of life skills do you two have?

384
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,440
I don't want to wear a tourniquet.

385
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,760
Third Uncle, don't underestimate me.

386
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,400
Hai Shao is a full-fledged talent and a high-tech expert.

387
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,760
It's a new era now.

388
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
We should use new technology more.

389
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,960
Those messy things are useless to us.

390
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,400
The facts prove that on the way back from Germany,

391
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,040
high-tech has played a big role.

392
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,560
What skills do you have? Tell me.

393
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,960
Me? I...

394
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,120
He can eat. He won't starve to death.

395
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,160
Hai Shao, don't listen to him.

396
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,800
Third Uncle, I'm actually very capable.

397
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,960
I...

398
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,760
What are you saying?

399
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,720
Say it.

400
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,560
What are you saying?

401
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,640
That means there's none left.

402
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,960
No. You two can't go down.

403
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,320
Third Uncle, Wu Xie and I have experienced life and death tests together.

404
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,800
Third Uncle, you don't know.

405
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,160
Every girl who studies archaeology has a man in her heart.

406
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,240
So you can't underestimate me.

407
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,400
This guy is not bad.

408
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,840
You?

409
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,800
Impossible.

410
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,600
Why?

411
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,720
Okay, okay.

412
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,920
The time is tight. I don't have time to talk to you.

413
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,320
I'll open the calligraphy these few days.

414
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,640
Help me prepare some things.

415
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,840
Don't buy any fake goods.

416
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,440
Okay.

417
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,720
Third Uncle,

418
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,600
can you take me with you?

419
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,840
You should go buy things with them first.

420
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,240
Third Uncle, I swear I won't cause you any trouble.

421
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,680
Just promise me, okay?

422
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,200
Third Uncle.

423
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,440
Third Uncle, I won't cause you any trouble.

424
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,720
Third Uncle.

425
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,680
Third Uncle.

426
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Third Uncle.

427
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Why does it sound like this?

428
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Third Uncle.

429
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,840
Third Uncle.

430
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,840
Third Uncle.

431
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,840
Third Uncle.

432
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Third Uncle.

433
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,840
Third Uncle.

434
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
Third Uncle.

435
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Third Uncle.

436
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Third Uncle.

437
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Third Uncle.

438
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
Third Uncle.

439
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,840
Third Uncle.

440
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
Third Uncle.

441
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840
Third Uncle.

442
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
It's so early. Come in.

443
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,040
Third Uncle, I've brought everything you asked for.

444
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
It's in the car outside.

445
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,440
You're usually not that active.

446
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,040
Why are you so quick today?

447
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
It's 20,800 in total.

448
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,240
I've already memorized the calligraphy.

449
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
It's quite a lot.

450
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,840
So you're not going to give me this money?

451
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,840
What money?

452
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,240
We're talking about calligraphy, aren't we?

453
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,440
Look, I've already completely broken down this calligraphy.

454
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,240
This is the corresponding map I made.

455
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,440
These past two days have really exhausted me.

456
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,440
What are you doing?

457
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,640
Looking at it.

458
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,640
I haven't finished breaking it down.

459
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
I'm going to go.

460
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
I'm going to go.

461
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,640
Third Uncle, you've understood everything?

462
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,040
I've understood.

463
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,840
I've understood it.

464
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,040
That's good.

465
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,640
Third Uncle, I've already thought about it.

466
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,040
Let's both manage it.

467
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,640
Let's take this map to the police first.

468
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,240
Then we'll immediately go to the valley.

469
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,040
If those foreign pawnshops take the relics,

470
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,840
that'll be troublesome.

471
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,440
They're here.

472
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,840
Third Uncle!

473
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,040
Hurry, hurry! You haven't eaten breakfast yet, right?

474
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
I brought you some really delicious breakfast.

475
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,240
Look, fried chicken.

476
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,640
Do you like it? Come, eat it.

477
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,040
Eat it. It's delicious.

478
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,040
Eat it.

479
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,440
This fried food isn't healthy.

480
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,040
You go buy some light food.

481
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,040
Before you act, you must pay attention to your health.

482
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,640
You even have this kind of statement?

483
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,440
How can I not have this kind of statement?

484
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,040
I'm not going to eat it.

485
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,440
I'm going to eat it.

486
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,640
You have this kind of statement?

487
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,840
How can I not have this kind of statement?

488
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
This is my experience.

489
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,240
Go look around.

490
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,040
There seems to be a porridge shop.

491
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,640
Hurry and go.

492
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,640
Third Uncle, but...

493
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,440
I want to discuss with you about the sub-project first.

494
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,640
This matter can be discussed later.

495
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,840
Hurry and go buy some porridge.

496
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,440
Go.

497
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,840
Okay.

498
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,040
What are you waiting for?

499
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,040
I feel that Third Uncle is a bit strange.

500
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
He seems to have deliberately driven us away.

501
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,640
How come I never heard of

502
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,640
the statement that we must pay attention to our diet before the sub-project?

503
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,040
Right. There must be something wrong.

504
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Chen Zhen Sheng and Han Shou have already prepared it.

505
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,840
When are we leaving?

506
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,840
I didn't agree to take them two.

507
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
Especially that girl.

508
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,040
You are eavesdropping.

509
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Don't say anything.

510
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,440
But Third Uncle, Chen Zhen Sheng has helped a lot.

511
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,240
I am doing this for her own good.

512
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,640
Our actions this time are very dangerous.

513
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:30,440
Say, if we really meet that

514
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
Don't say anything.

515
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,440
I definitely won't drag you down.

516
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,040
I ate more than Han Shou, but I am stronger than her.

517
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
I agree to the first half.

518
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Don't say anything.

519
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,840
Chen Zhen Sheng, listen to me.

520
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,040
It's inconvenient for a girl to go to that kind of place.

521
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,240
Moreover, that kind of place is not as simple and complicated as you think.

522
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,440
Third Uncle, you know that I am studying to be an archaeologist.

523
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,840
I am not afraid of suffering.

524
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,440
Moreover, my aunt is also an archaeologist.

525
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,040
Why can she do things that I can't do?

526
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,440
The main thing is that I lost Aunt Wen Jin's belongings.

527
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,040
If I go back empty-handed, how can I treat her well?

528
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,040
Your aunt is Chen Wen Jin?

529
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,440
Yes.

530
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,440
You know her?

531
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,040
I have thought about it.

532
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,240
Not only do we know each other,

533
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,440
we have also thought about it.

534
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,840
I was planning to marry your aunt.

535
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,640
Who knew that she suddenly disappeared?

536
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,040
Third Uncle, do you know how my aunt disappeared?

537
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,840
I am not sure about the specific reason.

538
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
I just heard that she disappeared by accident.

539
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,440
Until now, I can't even find her.

540
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,840
I can't see her. I can't die.

541
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
That's not right.

542
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,040
You should know about your family's matter better than I do.

543
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,840
But my family never talks about my aunt's matter.

544
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,440
Even Uncle Bo, I secretly found it from his belongings.

545
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,880
Third Uncle, do you think that Uncle Bo's

546
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,240
map is the one that shows the tomb?

547
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,240
Is there any clue about my aunt in this tomb?

548
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,040
I don't know.

549
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,840
Third Uncle, since we are all family members,

550
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,240
then Uncle Bo is related to my aunt's disappearance.

551
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,640
I have to go to the tomb no matter what.

552
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,640
I already said that I can't.

553
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,440
As your uncle, I have to take care of your safety.

554
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,240
I am a bit tired today. You guys can leave first.

555
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,640
Third Uncle, if you really want me to be good, then take me to the tomb.

556
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,840
What is going on?

557
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,640
You and my aunt are better than that. You must have heard about my matter, right?

558
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,440
My mother died early and my father was so busy.

559
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,640
It was always my aunt who took care of me.

560
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,840
To me, my aunt is like my half-mother.

561
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,440
But, since she disappeared and died,

562
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,840
since then, I have completely become a child without a mother.

563
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,040
My father has been looking for my aunt for so many years and he didn't find her.

564
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:37,240
The only wish he had before he died was for my aunt to come back safely.

565
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,440
That's why, I learned to be a archaeologist not for myself, but for my aunt.

566
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,640
I hope that one day, I can see her again. Do you know that?

567
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,640
Chengcheng, I understand your feelings.

568
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,640
But if you have any problems, how can I explain it to your aunt?

569
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,640
You don't understand. You don't understand at all!

570
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Chengcheng! Chengcheng!

571
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,640
Chengcheng! Chengcheng!

572
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,240
I apologize on behalf of my third uncle.

573
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,640
I don't need your apology. I just want to find my aunt.

574
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
But...

575
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,640
I didn't know about your family's situation before.

576
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Don't cry.

577
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,640
Wu Xie, help me convince my third uncle.

578
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Convince my third uncle.

579
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:53,640
I beg you. Let him take me to the country with him, okay?

580
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,640
You will definitely help me, right?

581
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
Listen to me.

582
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
It's not that I don't want to help you.

583
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Third Uncle is right.

584
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,640
You're a girl. You shouldn't go to such a dangerous place.

585
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,640
If you meet...

586
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
No need!

587
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,640
I can see that you're the same as your third uncle.

588
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,640
None of you treat me like your own person.

589
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Don't get so excited, okay?

590
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,640
I promise you that after I go down the tomb, I will keep in touch with you.

591
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
I will tell you the situation at any time.

592
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,640
No need!

593
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Are you pitying me?

594
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
I don't need your pity!

595
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
I'm telling you.

596
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,640
Without you, I can still find my aunt.

597
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,640
Did you forget to lock the door again?

598
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
Third Uncle, you haven't found anyone for so long.

599
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Why don't you call the police?

600
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,640
Call the police?

601
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
How long has he been missing?

602
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,640
The police won't take it if he's not here for 24 hours.

603
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,640
But if he's just angry, he should have come back a long time ago.

604
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,640
What's going on?

605
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,640
My family is so easy to break in.

606
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,640
Oh no, Chen Chengcheng is missing.

607
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,640
Could it be that he was caught by the Daomutuan?

608
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,640
If we don't rule out this possibility,

609
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,640
we can see that the previous group of people

610
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,640
can really do things like kidnapping.

611
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,640
If I agree to take him to the tomb,

612
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,640
he won't run away alone.

613
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
This is also my fault.

614
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,640
When Uncle Bo was robbed, I called the police.

615
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,640
If there were police, they wouldn't have kidnapped him so openly.

616
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
They don't care about the missing time.

617
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
They should be in charge of the tomb.

618
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,640
Wu Xie, don't be impulsive.

619
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,640
Think about it.

620
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,640
If Chen Chengcheng was really easily kidnapped by them,

621
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,640
it means that they are very good at our every move.

622
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
So if you call the police now,

623
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
it might be bad for Chen Chengcheng.

624
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
Right. They have a knife and a gun.

625
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
It's very likely that they will hurt Chen Chengcheng.

626
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,640
That's not true.

627
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,640
They must have a plan to kidnap Chen Chengcheng.

628
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
So they won't hurt him.

629
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Instead, we must not alert the enemy.

630
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,640
But if we don't call the police, what should we do?

631
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
What else can we do?

632
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,640
If we find the tomb, we can find those people.

633
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,640
If Chen Chengcheng was really kidnapped by the Daomutuan,

634
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
we will find the tomb first.

635
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
We will wait for them to show up.

636
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Pack up quickly. Let's go tomorrow morning.

637
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Okay.

638
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,640
Third Uncle.

639
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Hello, Third Uncle.

640
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
Why did you bring so many things?

641
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,640
These are his belongings.

642
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
I bought these for you.

643
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
I don't need these.

644
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Third Uncle, are those people from Jialaba here?

645
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,640
They are meeting in Shandong.

646
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,640
Jialaba? What does that mean?

647
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,640
It means to launch a group operation.

648
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
You understand it like that?

649
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
Okay, let's go.

650
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640
We are on the road.

651
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
We have left Hangzhou.

652
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
Now we only have three people.

653
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
This is Wu Xie.

654
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,640
Hi.

655
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,640
This is Third Uncle.

656
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,640
We are going to protect the cultural relics and save Chen Chengcheng.

657
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Yeah.

658
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
We are on our way to the Guazi Temple.

659
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,640
We are going to collapse on the way.

660
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
Fortunately, Chen Chengcheng is not here.

661
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,640
Otherwise, he will be crazy.

662
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Third Uncle, how long do we have to go?

663
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
We are going to die.

664
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
Soon.

665
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
How long do we have to go?

666
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,640
I said it's soon.

667
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
I told you not to follow me.

668
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,640
You insisted.

669
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,640
You said it's soon last time.

670
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
We are here.

671
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,640
What is this place?

672
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,640
There is no signal.

673
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,640
Look at that guy.

674
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
He is really wild.

675
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
It's not the time.

676
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
Let's go.

677
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
Let's go.

678
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
This is the way I want to go.

679
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
This way.

680
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
What is that?

681
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
That is not wild.

682
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,640
That is called a man.

683
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,640
But it's really wild.

684
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Look at the scar on his face.

685
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
It looks fierce.

686
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
Pan Zi.

687
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
So he is from Third Uncle.

688
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
Third Uncle.

689
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
Pan Zi, long time no see.

690
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,640
Yes, Third Uncle.

691
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,640
Let me introduce you.

692
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
This is my nephew Wu Xie.

693
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,640
This is his good friend, Hai Shao.

694
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,640
Third Uncle, I have heard about you.

695
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
I finally see you this time.

696
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
Just call me Pan Zi.

697
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Hello, Pan Zi.

698
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,640
This is the first time I and my friend are together.

699
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,640
Please take care of me.

700
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Don't worry, Third Uncle.

701
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
I will protect you.

702
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
Even if you are in danger,

703
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
I will not hurt you.

704
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
Thank you.

705
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
Pan Zi.

706
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
There is something.

707
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,640
I don't know if Third Uncle told you before he came out.

708
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
I told you.

709
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,640

00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,640
The mahjong is over.

712
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
The mahjong is over 2.

713
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,640
The prize-winning queen.

714
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,640
Find the gold city.

715
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
Recruit the cat.

716
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Reward the captain.

717
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
High rate of compensation.

718
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
The reward frequency is high.

719
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,640
There are many opportunities to take revenge.

720
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Hurry up.

Don't worry.

723
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,640
I promise I won't take anything this time.

724
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Just go to see it.

725
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
With your words,

726
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
I can rest assured.

727
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,640
Pan Zi, you are really a man of spirit.

728
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Your spirit is extraordinary.

729
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,640
Teach me how to practice.

730
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
Compared to that little brother,

731
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
I am far from it.

732
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
That is the real spirit.

733
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,640
I can't even lie down.

734
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,640
Third Master,

735
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,640
he is also here to teach us, right?

736
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
Yes.

737
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
It's him.

738
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
Don't ask.

739
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,640
We will set off when we arrive in Hong Kong.

740
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
Pan Zi.

741
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,640
We met again.

742
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,640
He seems to not remember us.

743
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,640
Let's go.

744
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
What are you looking at?

745
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
I am asking.

746
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
I understand.

747
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
No problem.

748
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,640
I know Third Master.

749
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,640
I am ready.

750
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
Don't worry.

751
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,640
Third Uncle.

752
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,640
Who is that person?

753
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
I don't know either.

754
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
A friend from Changsha introduced him.

755
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,640
They called him Little Brother.

756
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
Little Brother?

757
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
I think

758
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,640
we should call him Man Ying Ping.

759
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
Third Master.

760
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
The Hong Kong island is here.

761
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
Yes.

762
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,640
Third Master.

763
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,640
Are you Li Bo?

764
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Yes.

765
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
I am late.

766
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
I went to look for a cattle car.

767
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
Get ready to set off.

768
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,640
Yes.

769
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,640
I am going.

770
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,640
Get ready to set off.

771
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
Yes.

772
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,640
Is it hell or heaven?

773
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,640
On the vast sky above,

774
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,640
is it night or morning?

775
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,640
Is it the heart that insists on it?

776
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,640
Is it a lie or the truth?

777
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:41,640
Are you lost?

778
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,640
If the soul exists,

779
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,640
it is just an illusion.

780
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,640
Is it absurd to

781
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,640
defend my ideals?

782
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,640
What I give you is nothing.

783
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,640
Who is the heart or the palm?

784
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,640
I will fight with all my might.

785
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,640
Your fearlessness,

786
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,640
my tears,

787
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:59,640
are all buried in my heart.

788
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,640
What is flowing in the snow?

789
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,640
The shape of the flower.

790
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,640
Too much growth,

791
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,640
takes you to me.

792
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,640
I follow your guidance,

793
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,640
and take you to the end of the world.

794
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,640
I follow your guidance,

795
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,640
and untie the thread of the past.

796
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,640
I can't stop you,

797
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,640
from breaking the black curtain.

798
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:49,640
I am willing to be reckless.

799
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,640
The past,

800
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,640
are all dreams.

801
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,640
Truth,

802
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,640
is a secret.

803
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,640
Your fearlessness,

804
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,640
my tears,

805
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:21,640
are all buried in my heart.

806
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:41,640
I am willing to be reckless.

807
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:49,640
I am willing to be reckless.

808
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,640
Don't ask,

809
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,640
the sky is blue.

810
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,640
The morning wind,

811
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:11,640
this sudden snow,

812
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:19,640
what can I do?
