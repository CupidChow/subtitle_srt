00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not a good dancer.

61
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not a good dancer.

62
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not a good dancer.

63
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000

I'm not a good dancer.

68
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not a good dancer.

69
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not a good dancer.

70
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not a good dancer.

71
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not a good dancer.

72
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not a good dancer.

73
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The End

74
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What's going on?

75
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why is everyone like ghosts?

76
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How do I know?

77
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You don't know?

78
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Granny.

79
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This thing is very important to me.

80
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you don't tell me,

81
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We four will kneel in front of this restaurant.

82
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Who told you to sit down?

83
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Stand up!

84
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Cheng.

85
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Take these rascals away.

86
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I've heard this guy,

87
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840
Especially you, Madam Huo.

88
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,200
You said you were more popular than Empress Dowager Siqi.

89
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,400
You're the most popular today.

90
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,720
But if you really let us get these things,

91
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,040
it'll make you people look down on us, right?

92
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,000
But our Young Master is a good man.

93
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,600
But Fatty Wang is a rogue since he was a kid.

94
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,360
He's not a good temper.

95
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,320
If we compete later,

96
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,440
and ruin this place,

97
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,640
it'll be bad for the reputation of your Huo family.

98
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,440
Da Cheng, send the guest.

99
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,600
Don't come over.

100
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,160
Wait.

101
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,720
You're also good-looking.

102
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,520
You're not as smart as you.

103
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,120
You're not going to play?

104
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,160
That girl is pretty good.

105
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,840
If you could enter her name,

106
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,200
then...

107
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,640
How could she say using a fake name with

108
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,880
a fake word that uses the word does advertising makes her different?

109
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,640
How about losing the popularity of this facility if you're her?

110
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,760
Not so.

111
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,880
I understand.

112
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,560
But if you want to do business,

113
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,860
What will happen if you do it?

114
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,260
Let her do it.

115
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,460
If she wants to do it, let her do it.

116
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,460
Granny, I really did it.

117
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,960
I really don't know what grudges you had with my grandmother.

118
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,560
If my grandfather did something that was against you,

119
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,160
how about this?

120
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,960
If you slap me, I'll take it as a way to vent my anger.

121
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,960
Fine. I'm afraid of you, Young Master Wu.

122
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,960
But don't ask me first.

123
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,160
Even if you ask, I won't say anything.

124
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,460
Just sit here like this.

125
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,160
Sit until four thirty.

126
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,160
If you can sit, I won't make it difficult for you.

127
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Just sit here.

128
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Yes. Just sit here.

129
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,660
Don't worry.

130
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,660
I won't make you bored.

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Look, it's starting.

132
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
The most exciting game on the line.

133
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
The mahjong is over.

134
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
The mahjong is over.

135
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,160
The prize-winning queen.

136
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
The treasure-seeking golden city.

137
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:25,940
The

138
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,940
Granny, is it starting?

139
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,940
It's starting.

140
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,940
Wait.

141
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,940
We'll have a good show today.

142
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,940
The auction is starting.

143
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,940
The auction is about to start.

144
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,940
Everyone, please leave the stage.

145
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,940
We're really at the right place.

146
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,940
We're about to start distributing the auction list and the winnings.

147
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:35,940
Ah...

148
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,940
Wu Xie, something's off.

149
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,940
You take a look at other directions.

150
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,940
Whether someone damaged or anyone ruptured,

151
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,940
this 그런 Duck's Over invited is empty.

152
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,580
The

153
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,620
Lady,

154
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,940
did your friend seat wrong?

155
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,100
You haven't seen such an event for a long time, have you?

156
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,180
You don't believe that someone dares to sit in this position?

157
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,180
It's been more than ten years,

158
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,100
since Old Changsheng sat here,

159
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,500
no one dares to sit in this position.

160
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,500
But this thing we've taken today

161
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
is a hundred years old

162
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
A few people who are not willing to die

163
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
are also a good example

164
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Hurry up and give Young Master Wu a flower list

165
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Take good care of him

166
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Let him give you a good eye

167
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Okay

168
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
This is a precious item

169
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Yes

170
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Boss, this is for us

171
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Please enjoy

172
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Call us anytime

173
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
A 8,000 yuan ship

174
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
You're so generous

175
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Wu Xie

176
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Wu Xie

177
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Come

178
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Come with me

179
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
It's not like yesterday

180
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Let's go

181
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
This restaurant

182
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
has been for a long time

183
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
No one dares to light this lantern

184
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
You've also made the Wu family proud

185
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
From now on

186
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
No one knows

187
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,500
your young master's reputation

188
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
What does this mean?

189
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Lighting a lantern

190
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I think I've heard of it before

191
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
It's just a temporary

192
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
I'm afraid

193
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
your family

194
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,500
will be burned down by your lantern

195
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
The auction begins now

196
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Please start

197
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Fatty

198
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
How much do you want now?

199
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Almost a hundred million

200
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
A hundred million

201
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
The mid-term break

202
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
will start in a while

203
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Each auction is worth two million

204
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
It's a good start

205
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
See

206
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,500
This little girl is so evil

207
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
There are so many buyers

208
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
The number of people is zero

209
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Every time the price is raised

210
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
the bells are ringing

211
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
You can hear it from anywhere

212
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
You never miss it

213
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
You can hear it through your ears

214
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Yeah

215
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Mr. Huo hasn't married yet

216
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Is he going to add a big horse?

217
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Wu Xie

218
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Why are you sweating so much?

219
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Do you know what a lantern is?

220
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,500
In the rules of the auction

221
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,500
No matter what you sell this round

222
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
the price is the highest

223
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
In the end, the person who lit the lantern

224
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
will buy it at the highest price

225
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
That is to say

226
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,500
I'll take the place of this round

227
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
That's right

228
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
The lantern is like a gamble

229
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
A fire can burn you to the core

230
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Just like a lot of gambling

231
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,500
You lose in the night

232
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,500
This lantern is not something you can play with money

233
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
If the person who lit the lantern

234
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,500
can't bear the price

235
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Only the one who hasn't married

236
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
will get a auction

237
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
And the one who lit the lantern

238
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
and can't get married

239
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,500
will have to pay for his actions

240
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Sometimes it's money

241
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Sometimes it's...

242
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
What?

243
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
The family's property

244
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Or else

245
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
One hand and one leg

246
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
That's enough

247
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Young Master, I just remembered

248
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Today the old man asked us to go home for dinner

249
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Let's not play around

250
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Let's go

251
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
No

252
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
This time, the whole factory

253
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
has only one item

254
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
It seems that the goods are in good condition today

255
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
We will not give up until the end

256
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,500
If I burn these two lanterns

257
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Even if it's a family property

258
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
I'm afraid it's not enough

259
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
What should we do?

260
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
I said they are all playing with their lives

261
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,500
And in the end, we are the ones paying

262
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
I can't think of that much now

263
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
I'm afraid I can't do anything

264
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
I can't think of that much now

265
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
From the beginning, this old lady

266
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
wanted to deliberately trick us

267
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Now the goods have been created

268
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
We can't control what clues are not clues

269
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
I really can't

270
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Let's jump straight down

271
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Run away without the snake's consent

272
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm one hundred meters and twelve seconds five

273
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Really?

274
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I can't believe it

275
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
I can't believe it

276
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
You are sick

277
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
How far is it

278
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
I can hear it

279
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
I'll try

280
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Little girl

281
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Come up and catch the fat man

282
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Otherwise, you will find out

283
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Fat man, stop talking

284
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
I can't hear

285
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
God

286
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Go

287
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
It's too late

288
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Wait

289
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
You forgot to make an appointment with the old lady

290
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Five minutes left

291
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Fat man, can you hold on for five minutes?

292
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
No problem

293
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Since we are here

294
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
The fire has broken into the beast

295
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Can't go forward

296
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Just five minutes

297
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
I want to let the old lady see what is called a crazy drum

298
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
OK, I'll make a move today

299
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Let you crazy drum

300
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Go

301
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Go

302
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Hold on

303
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
I can't hold on

304
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Hold on

305
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Why do you eat so many chips

306
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Hold on

307
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
You are crazy

308
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
You offended the boss

309
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Do you know what the consequences will be

310
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Granny, as you said

311
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
This restaurant has been open for too long

312
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
The boss is too stable

313
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Someone has to give him some excitement

314
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
I'll be a good person today

315
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Give him excitement

316
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Fat man, you bleed

317
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
It's okay, I bleed every month

318
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Stop

319
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Don't do it

320
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Stop

321
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Don't move the stool

322
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
You can't kneel

323
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Chengcheng, move away

324
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
You go

325
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
I'll beat you

326
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
You go

327
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Come again

328
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Hurry up

329
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Go and help Wu Xie

330
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Chengcheng, move

331
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Chengcheng

332
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Tong Feng, you can't cheat

333
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
You can hit the field, but I can't hit you

334
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Who is cheating

335
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Still saying that there is no knife

336
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Knife

337
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Go

338
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Go

339
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Go

340
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Hit

341
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Hurry up

342
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Go

343
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Granny, we'll ask next time

344
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Goodbye

345
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Hurry up

346
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Stop

347
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Hurry up

348
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Hurry up

349
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
What?

350
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
The young master of the Xie family always helps me

351
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Do you know each other

352
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Don't know

353
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
But it looks a little familiar

354
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Let's go

355
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Stop

356
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Stop

357
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Don't run

358
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
You still don't chase?

359
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
You're persistent

360
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Can you hold on?

361
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
It's okay, you go first

362
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
I'll go first

363
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Be careful, Brother

364
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Go

365
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Hurry

366
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Be careful

367
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
This way

368
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
This way

369
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Hurry

370
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Follow me

371
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Go in

372
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Hurry

373
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
You go over there

374
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Yes

375
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Let's go

376
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
It's okay, let's go

377
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Hurry

378
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
It's okay, they should have left

379
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
We haven't completely rid of them

380
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Don't relax

381
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
They shouldn't dare to do anything on the street

382
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
They can't do anything

383
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Right

384
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Hurry up

385
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
What's wrong?

386
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
The phone fell, let's buy a new one

387
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
No, I'm going to the hotel

388
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
If they cut our phone

389
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Our identity will be revealed

390
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
They will know

391
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
What should we do?

392
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
I'll go find it

393
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
You two find a place to hide

394
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Be careful

395
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Be careful

396
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
I'll help him

397
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Hurry

398
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Chen Sheng

399
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
What's going on?

400
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Let me go

401
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Stop joking, hurry

402
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Why are you in a hurry?

403
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
I have something to tell you

404
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
What do you mean?

405
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
You are really naive

406
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Get up

407
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Get up

408
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Get up

409
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Get up

410
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Get up

411
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Get up

412
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Wu Xie

413
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I feel like I've been pierced

414
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
I really am Chen Sheng

415
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Some people feel ignorant

416
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
They will look cute

417
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Let me tell you

418
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
You are stupid

419
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
You did it

420
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Why?

421
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Why?

422
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Wu Xie, let me tell you

423
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
I'm not Chen Cheng Cheng

424
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
Chen Cheng Cheng

425
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Does have a niece

426
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
But not me

427
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
You lied to me

428
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
The phone is not lost

429
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
What are you doing?

430
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Of course I'm informing

431
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Your dear third uncle

432
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Why did you involve third uncle?

433
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Because he is as stupid as you

434
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
I said I was Chen Wen Jin's niece

435
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
He really believed

436
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
No doubt

437
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
We are friends, right?

438
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Many people would rather deny the truth

439
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
And not face the truth

440
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Wake up, friend

441
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Who are you?

442
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Who am I?

443
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
As long as I can achieve my goal

444
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
I can have any identity

445
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Become anyone

446
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Why did you lie to me?

447
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
Like you

448
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
All for the sake of the same reason

449
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
I came here

450
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Not to be friends with you

451
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
You can guess

452
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
I'm stuck in Wu Sanxing

453
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
What do I do?

454
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
You Wu family are really a gold

455
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
The descendants of the Jiumen

456
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
But can't see the heart and nature

457
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
To be honest

458
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Everything I do is for this fish

459
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
But my perfect plan

460
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
And you are the self-righteous

461
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Young master of the Wu family

462
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
All messed up

463
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Third uncle should be more reasonable than you

464
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
So I'm looking for fish

465
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
I have to ask him again

466
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
I went out in person

467
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Don't say

468
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
Third uncle won't come

469
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Wrong

470
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
For you, Wu Sanxing will come

471
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Wu Xie, you have to know

472
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
You killed your third uncle

473
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
That is to say

474
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
From the beginning, you came to Hangzhou to find me

475
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
See third uncle and we

476
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Protect cultural relics together

477
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,500
All of this is fake

478
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
We really know each other not long

479
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
But I trust you

480
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Even more than a little

481
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
You are so naive

482
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
It's too easy to believe others

483
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Only people who cross the moral boundary

484
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Can be the real strong

485
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Wait

486
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
What's wrong again, young master of the Wu family

487
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Third uncle cares about you

488
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
If you still have a little conscience

489
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Don't involve him

490
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Fish, I will find a way to give it to you

491
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Don't say anything

492
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
You are to me

493
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
No use value

494
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Chenchen

495
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Sit down

496
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
I want to save people

497
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Just exchange the snake's eyebrows with the copper fish

498
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Okay

499
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Next, you die

500
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
It depends on how Wu Sanxing does it

501
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
How can you do this

502
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Isn't Chinese people the most affectionate

503
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Affection

504
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
What is affection

505
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
You think I'm the same as that Aning

506
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
You are a group

507
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Just him

508
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
He is a stupid woman who has no courage

509
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Although we are the same boss

510
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
But you must not compare me to him

511
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
He is not worthy

512
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Chen Chengcheng

513
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Shut up

514
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
I warn you from now on

515
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Don't call me that name

516
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
How to say, we have eaten together

517
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
We have blood together

518
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
How to say

519
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Business is not good, but the will is

520
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
You should understand better than me

521
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
You talk to the enemy about the will

522
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
You found the wrong person

523
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
You guys keep chasing me

524
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
What do you want

525
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
You want to know this

526
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Ask Aning yourself

527
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
How many people are there with me

528
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Is your person

529
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
You guess

530
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
So fast

531
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
You see

532
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
It's your third uncle's phone

533
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
What did you say before

534
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Never answer the phone

535
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Not reading the message is fake

536
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
How about it

537
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
You tell him

538
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
Or I tell him

539
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
Go

540
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
That way

541
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Wake up

542
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
They

543
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
They were caught

544
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
I

545
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Go that way

546
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Go that way

547
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
Hurry

548
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Go

549
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Get in the car

550
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Boss

551
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
The plan is done

552
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
The game can start

553
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
What

554
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
You guys say Chen Chengcheng is fake

555
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Isn't she Chen Wenjing's niece

556
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
She said

557
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
The uncle she found in Wenjing

558
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
Then she looked at her aunt

559
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
Is this fake

560
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
I'm so worried

561
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
I'm so worried

562
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
I'm so worried

563
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
I'm so worried

564
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
I'm so worried

565
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
I'm so worried

566
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
I knew Wenjing had a niece

567
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Not going to investigate

568
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
I thought it was okay

569
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
I didn't expect to be cheated

570
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Fortunately, you two didn't fall into her hands

571
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Don't blame yourself

572
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
Just blame that fake Chen Chengcheng

573
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
You lied to us

574
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Who is she

575
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
She is like Anning

576
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Serve the same boss

577
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
The boss is the owner of Zhangguo Boxu

578
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Zhangguo Boxu

579
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Qiu Dakao

580
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Qiu Dakao

581
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Is the owner of Niu Tou and Boxu

582
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,500
Uncle Three

583
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
You know her

584
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
What is she doing

585
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Don't worry about this

586
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
I tell you two

587
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
You two went to Beijing this time

588
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Give me such a big trouble

589
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Please give me a heart

590
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
Give me a heart, okay?

591
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Don't act without permission

592
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Don't believe anyone, okay?

593
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Qiu Dakao

594
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
So many years

595
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
It's actually on my head

596
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Uncle Three, just tell me

597
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
What kind of person is Qiu Dakao

598
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Wang Wu treats her like his own niece

599
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
This little girl cheated me so badly

600
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
You two talk slowly

601
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
I'll go play the computer

602
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
I didn't expect it to be like this

603
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Uncle Three, you can't always

604
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Treat me like an outsider

605
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
This little girl

606
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
I'm so angry

607
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
I really thought she was Wen Jin's niece

608
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
Wu Xie, come and see

609
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
What is this

610
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Say it, what's the matter with you

611
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
What's the matter with you

612
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
What's the matter with you

613
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
What's the matter with you

614
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
What's the matter with you

615
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
What's the matter with you

616
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
You found it all

617
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Uncle Three

618
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Who is she

619
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
She

620
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Is a little brother with the surname Zhang

621
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Looks like a person

622
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
You are all in the same photo

623
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
You should have some impression

624
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
20 years ago

625
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Who can remember so clearly

626
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Besides, when I first

627
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Met Xiao Ge

628
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
I also feel very familiar

629
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
But then I thought about it

630
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
20 years ago

631
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Xiao Ge is still a kid

632
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
How could you go to the sea with me

633
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
To the valley

634
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Uncle Three

635
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
What did you find

636
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
20 years ago

637
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
20 years ago

638
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Wen Jin and I

639
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
We were the second batch

640
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
The archaeologists recruited

641
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Actually we went

642
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,500
Just to be responsible

643
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
How to study how to enter that valley

644
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
But the environment

645
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Caused our research to be in trouble

646
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,500
As for the four corners of the stone

647
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
I suspected from the morning

648
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
It was brought in by other tomb raiders

649
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
That kind of seabed

650
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
The entry into the tomb must open the tomb wall

651
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Once opened

652
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
The seawater immediately swallows

653
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Causing unimaginable chain reaction

654
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
How did the tomb thief overcome

655
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
These contradictions

656
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
I still don't understand

657
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
After a month

658
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
Our research has really not progressed

659
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
The archaeological team was forced to leave

660
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
The tomb was sealed again

661
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
What about the research data

662
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Should be preserved

663
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
All the data and all the geographical locations

664
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Detailed to the government

665
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
After that, there is no after

666
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
Everything disappears in history

667
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
Why is it so important

668
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Why didn't you tell me

669
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
What can I tell you

670
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
The snake didn't agree

671
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
Sixty of the scholars at that time

672
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Can't figure out what this thing is for

673
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Later handed over to the government

674
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
They seem to have found

675
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
But we didn't receive those reports

676
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
I don't know if it was deducted

677
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
Or what happened

678
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
In short, this matter

679
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
It's over

680
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
Can you still find those materials now

681
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Wu Xie

682
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
Why are you so naive

683
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
What you can think of

684
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
Can't I think of your third uncle

685
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
Later, all those materials were locked

686
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
In the basement of the police station

687
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
A big fire a few years ago

688
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
All burned out

689
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Who knows what's strange

690
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Third uncle

691
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500
What about the tomb under the sea

692
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
So weird

693
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
With your temper

694
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
Even if you can't go

695
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
You don't go secretly

696
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
Third uncle, just tell me

697
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Don't sell the coffin

698
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
I swear I won't tell anyone

699
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500
No way

700
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
The rest of the secrets

701
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Even if I go to the coffin

702
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Third uncle

703
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
You don't feed me

704
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Give an explanation to Aunt Chen Wenjing

705
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
It's too like

706
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
How could it be so like

707
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
If it's the same person

708
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
It's impossible

709
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
It hasn't changed for more than 20 years

710
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:29,740
Look at the

711
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Brother, this hotel is open

712
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Open it

713
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,280
No

714
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
Let's go

715
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500
No

716
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,660
Go

717
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,240
Come here

718
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,500
Brother

719
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,520
It's me, Fatty.

720
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,620
I have a clue about that fish.

721
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,860
What?

722
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,000
Xiao Ge must be a zongzi.

723
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,200
Ya'er is a living one!

724
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,600
I think so too.

725
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,560
The two heroes are the same.

726
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,520
Enough.

727
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,560
Xiao Ge is a living person.

728
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,500
How could he be a zongzi?

729
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,720
But the person in the picture

730
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,500
must have something to do with Xiao Ge.

731
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,060
Of course, there's a connection.

732
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,620
Lu Wanggong and Xi Sha Hai are just friends.

733
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,220
This is related to the same cultural relics of the Lu Wang Palace and the West Desert Ocean.

734
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,220
It's definitely related.

735
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,820
And these two places are related to the Men You Ping.

736
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:30,020
Third Uncle told me that the Taoist Church activities of the Old Ninth Sect are related to this fish.

737
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,220
What is the origin of this fish?

738
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,620
It's not related. We have a lot of people and a lot of power. There must be a way.

739
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,020
I'm going to do business. I won't talk about this anymore.

740
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,020
Okay.

741
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,420
What should we do then?

742
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,420
Let's go back first.

743
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,420
We'll come back tomorrow.

744
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,420
Let's go.

745
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,820
Third Uncle.

746
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,820
Third Uncle.

747
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,820
Third Uncle.

748
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,820
Third Uncle.

749
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,820
Third Uncle.

750
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,820
Third Uncle.

751
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,820
What is the meaning of this current story?

752
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,820
Third Uncle.

753
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,820
Third Uncle.

754
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,820
Third Uncle.

755
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,820
I don't know how to read the story.

756
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,820
I don't know what to read.

757
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,820
Third Uncle.

758
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,820
Third Uncle.

759
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,820
Third Uncle.

760
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,100
What you have just heard

761
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,900
Unfortunately,

762
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,200
the Third Uncle will not be here with you.

763
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,600
What you heard

764
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,820
should not beкими heard with this.

765
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,600
Don't you trust your substitution

766
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,640
I just noticed,

767
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,720
I'm informed that

768
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,880
the someone went past this section before.

769
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,240
What can we do?

770
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,800
Do you really want me to let you die in the проб Ainu?

771
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,700
Because it's your execution.

772
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,480
I am not in charge of running this household.

773
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,160
Your daughter,

774
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,860
she was,

775
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,720
Gu gesam为她,

776
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,440
infallible,

777
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,940
too...

778
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,800
If she had escaped,

779
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,440
you might've been more Entranced,

780
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,760
or more capable.

781
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,960
But the chief-quarrel minister,

782
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,960
I was worried that the world would change for various reasons.

783
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,960
I thought that the Lujian Palace would be an end,

784
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,960
but I didn't expect that it would be the beginning of everything.

785
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Without the company of Third Uncle,

786
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,960
I could only go up to the sky

787
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,960
and explore the mysterious ancient organs of the remote world.

788
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,960
However, for the vast ocean that was about to come,

789
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,960
I knew nothing.

790
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:10,960
The place I've been to in my dreams is hell or heaven.

791
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Above the bright sky, is the night or the morning light.

792
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:25,960
The faith I persisted in is a lie or the truth.

793
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,960
Are you confused?

794
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:42,960
If the existence of the soul is just an illusion,

795
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,960
is the ideal of trying to avoid it still considered absurd?

796
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,960
What can I give you?

797
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,960
Is it the heart or the palm?

798
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,960
I will fight with all my might,

799
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,960
just to see how bright my life is.

800
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,960
The will of the people is fast and slow.

801
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:22,960
The road and river are all dreams.

802
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:30,960
The people are like mountains.

803
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:39,960
Your fearlessness, my tears,

804
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:49,960
are boiling in my heart.

805
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,960
What is flowing in the blood?

806
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,960
What is flowing in the night?

807
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,960
The shape of the flower.

808
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,960
Too many smooth growths,

809
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,960
take you to me.

810
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,960
Follow your guidance,

811
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,960
to untie the lie of the past.

812
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,960
You can't stop me,

813
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,460
to break the black

814
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:41,960
and the will of the people.

815
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:49,960
The road and river are all dreams.

816
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:58,960
The truth is growing.

817
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:06,960
Your fearlessness, my tears,

818
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,960
are boiling in my heart.

819
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:28,960
Love,

820
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,960
dream, break.

821
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,960
Take the pain away,

822
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,960
feel the sadness.

823
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,960
Don't ask the sky and earth,

824
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,960
the morning wind,

825
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:03,960
this piece of the world,

826
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:11,960
is the only thing that can stop it.
