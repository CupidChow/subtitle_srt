I'm not a good dancer.

58
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not a good dancer.

59
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not a good dancer.

60
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not a good dancer.

61
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not a good dancer.

62
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not a good dancer.

63
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not a good dancer.

64
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not a good dancer.

65
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not a good dancer.

66
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not a good dancer.

67
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not a good dancer.

68
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not a good dancer.

69
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not a good dancer.

70
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not a good dancer.

71
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not a good dancer.

72
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not a good dancer.

73
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The End

74
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Fatty!

75
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Fatty, wait for me!

76
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Fatty!

77
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Why are you here?

78
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Did you put this fire here?

79
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're so noisy.

80
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What are you doing?

81
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Why are you taking the fire?

82
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm helping to save the fire.

83
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The things in the city water were all taken away.

84
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There's only this left.

85
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This...

86
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You said this is a fire?

87
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Nonsense.

88
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What's wrong with you taking water?

89
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hurry up.

90
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Call the troops.

91
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Call the troops.

92
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The mountains in front are all down.

93
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Look over there.

94
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Look over there.

95
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, no.

96
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What if the hole is broken?

97
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's a hassle if we don't run away.

98
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't stand there.

99
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's go.

100
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's go.

101
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Sister, sister, sister.

102
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're here too.

103
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What are we doing here?

104
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
They're opening the way ahead.

105
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You two don't know the terrain here.

106
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You'd better carry water with me.

107
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The sea water is too long.

108
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The water is too far away.

109
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This water can't solve any problems.

110
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You know the army, right?

111
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why are you holding this bird's nest?

112
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This water is for drinking.

113
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There's no water in the fire.

114
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They can't stand it.

115
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They cut out a fireproof bag inside.

116
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
When the fire was burning there,

117
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
nothing was burning.

118
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It was extinguished by itself.

119
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You two don't understand.

120
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't mess with each other.

121
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's go.

122
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The fire is extinguished.

123
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The fire is not burning.

124
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll go and have a look.

125
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Come on.

126
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The fire is extinguished.

127
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The soldiers should have been burned to death.

128
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No.

129
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm still worried.

130
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What if the soldiers run away?

131
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The whole village will suffer.

132
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll go in and have a look.

133
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll go with you.

134
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You go.

135
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's not enough to make a mess.

136
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll go.

137
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This.

138
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Give this to Wu Xie.

139
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Tell him to donate to the Ministry of Culture.

140
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Call.

141
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Call.

142
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This is my phone number.

143
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Call me if you need anything.

144
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
See you later.

145
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm leaving.

146
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This fat guy is quite aware.

147
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Wu Xie, you're finally awake.

148
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Where are you going?

149
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

150
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Go to save the fire.

151
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You also learn to save others.

152
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're so stupid.

153
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't cause trouble to others.

154
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hurry up and pack up.

155
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We're going home soon.

156
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hurry up.

157
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm finally going home.

158
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going home.

159
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
By the way, is anyone hurt?

160
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't worry.

161
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I've already died.

162
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The mountain has collapsed.

163
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No one will go to the tomb anymore.

164
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
By the way, where's Fatty?

165
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Did he go to save the fire with you?

166
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
After the fire with me, Fatty left a phone number.

167
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Then he handed the book to me.

168
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Said to let us hand it to the Cultural relics Protection Administration.

169
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let me study first.

170
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's written on it?

171
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now, except for this book,

172
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
he didn't get anything else.

173
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Only left a lot of difficult problems.

174
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Who said that?

175
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No matter what, Wu Xie,

176
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
you're out of the mountain this time.

177
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
By the way, Wu Xie,

178
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I have a very serious question for you.

179
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I heard from Uncle San.

180
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Uncle San said you're quite protective of that female mercenary.

181
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Really?

182
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I just think...

183
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hurry up and join the Aomenshin Peking Entertainment City 772772.com.

184
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
She doesn't look like a bad person.

185
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What are you talking about?

186
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
A bad person is a bad person.

187
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What do you mean by not looking like a bad person?

188
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The An Ning I see

189
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
is different from the An Ning you see.

190
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What are you talking about?

191
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You're not going to be sleepy, are you?

192
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm awake.

193
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're awake?

194
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
By the way,

195
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
who is that fat guy?

196
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How can he be the only one to play the role?

197
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I just took a picture with him.

198
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That figure is really good.

199
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Fat guy.

200
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I can only say that a fat guy

201
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
is a fat guy who is out of the world.

202
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We're back.

203
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We're finally back.

204
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm tired.

205
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I need to rest.

206
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't bother me.

207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No.

208
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You have to take me to eat first.

209
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Eat apples first.

210
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Eat apples first.

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's so hot.

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Thanks.

213
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The food at home is the best.

214
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's rich and delicious.

215
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Wu Xie,

216
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I didn't think your taste is good.

217
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,600
Who am I?

218
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,400
Of course, I'm the one who only cares about eating.

219
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,800
Hey, aren't you going to help me?

220
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,800
Big Brother, you just ate so much.

221
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,400
It's easy to get a hammer if you exercise right away.

222
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll take a break first.

223
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wu Xie.

224
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
What are you thinking about?

225
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
King of Lushan,

226
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
Flower Temple,

227
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,200
Iron Face,

228
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
All this time,

229
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,600
I almost couldn't even save my own life.

230
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,900
So many things happened.

231
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,500
If I had known, I would have burned that uncle.

232
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,200
I would have pretended that nothing had happened.

233
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,100
You wouldn't.

234
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,400
Of course, he wouldn't, Big Brother.

235
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
With his personality,

236
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,400
he wouldn't let the wealth of the country be stolen for nothing.

237
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,000
So even if he had to choose again,

238
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,800
he would still do it.

239
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,000
Because he's a stubborn person.

240
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Stop playing the role of a witch.

241
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,400
Come help me.

242
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,800
What I'm most worried about right now is two things.

243
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,200
One is An Ning.

244
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,400
They chased the Flower Temple from Inner Mongolia.

245
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Is it just to find a secret?

246
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
They won't take anything.

247
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,800
I think they are definitely not an ordinary foreign-made group.

248
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,400
Behind them,

249
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,200
there must be a reason to not be a hostage.

250
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I think we should just lure them in.

251
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,400
We can directly get into the enemy's territory and find out the news.

252
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,800
I think your idea is very good.

253
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,200
You know a few languages anyway.

254
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,800
You are living with a foreigner, so there's no obstacle.

255
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,400
You think so too?

256
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,800
Actually, the thing I'm most worried about right now is the second thing.

257
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,400
You are worried about that little brother named Zhang, right?

258
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Don't you think that little brother named Zhang is very strange?

259
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
He knows too much.

260
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,400
It's like he went to that school before.

261
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,800
Since he's so powerful,

262
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,400
why would he still be shaking with Third Uncle?

263
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Wu Xie, I think his existence is very dangerous to you and Third Uncle.

264
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,400
It's better to get rid of your relationship earlier.

265
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
But he saved me.

266
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,400
If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have climbed out of that tree.

267
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,800
Men You Ping wouldn't be an enemy.

268
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,200
But does he treat you as a friend?

269
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,400
Let's ask him again when we meet next time.

270
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,000
Next time.

271
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
When is next time?

272
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,200
I don't know.

273
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,200
I don't know.

274
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Hello, Third Uncle?

275
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,600
He's here too. They're here too.

276
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
What?

277
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,800
They're coming over right now?

278
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
Why?

279
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,800
Why can't we let them know?

280
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,600
Oh, okay.

281
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,840
Chengcheng, didn't you say you wanted to go to the West Lake to play?

282
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,880
The weather is good today.

283
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,400
Why don't we go to the West Lake and eat delicious food?

284
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
That's great.

285
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,200
I didn't hear wrong, right?

286
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,520
Where else do you want to go?

287
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,240
I'm your guest and you're my master. Of course I'll ask you.

288
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,240
You're asking me? You're asking him?

289
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,080
Wu Xie, what are you thinking about? Where do you want to go?

290
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,000
Did you lock the door when I went out?

291
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
How would I know?

292
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,400
I think I forgot if I locked the door when I went out.

293
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,920
No way.

294
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,840
How about this? I'll go back and take a look.

295
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,440
You wait for me in the West Lake. I'll be back when I'm done.

296
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Then hurry up. We'll wait for you in the West Lake restaurant.

297
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,400
How did you lock the door?

298
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
I...

299
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Third Uncle.

300
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,080
Come with me.

301
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,600
How could it be fake?

302
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,200
We've been fooled.

303
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Look.

304
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,720
This is the real thing.

305
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,320
This is the real thing.

306
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,920
This thing's gold content is too pure.

307
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,320
In those days, it was impossible to make it.

308
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,520
This is an almost perfect fake.

309
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,120
How could it be?

310
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,120
If it's fake,

311
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,920
who put it in?

312
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Who put it in there?

313
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Could it be Meng Yingping?

314
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
I've been suspecting him for a long time.

315
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,320
This little brother suddenly disappeared.

316
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,120
I think he deliberately wanted to abandon us.

317
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,520
He did what he wanted to do.

318
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,520
Could it be that he was walking away from us?

319
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,520
He went to that cave alone.

320
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,520
He opened the coffin of King of Lushan.

321
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,520
He put this fake incense stick into it.

322
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Impossible.

323
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,520
How could he do it alone?

324
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,520
And that tree hole was pulled open by a chain.

325
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,520
If someone opened it, we would definitely see the traces.

326
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Have you ever seen the back of the coffin?

327
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,520
He might have dug a hole behind the tree.

328
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,520
Then he pulled the incense stick from the back of the coffin.

329
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
It's not your fault.

330
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
I've been in the Jianghu for more than ten years.

331
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
I didn't see it.

332
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,520
This person is really mysterious.

333
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,520
I thought he was a descendant of the General of the Faction.

334
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,520
But now it seems that his background is not as simple as we thought.

335
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Then the thing on the tree is also fake?

336
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,520
The story of the Mountain Sea Jing is not very credible.

337
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,520
It's just that we were infected by the mysterious atmosphere of the tomb.

338
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
We believed it at the moment.

339
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,520
Now that I think about it, there are indeed some flaws.

340
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Think about it.

341
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Why do you only understand the last two most important parts?

342
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
You can't understand the rest.

343
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
In fact, he was already in the way.

344
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Now the entrance is already collapsed.

345
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,520
It's not possible for us to go back to the tomb to find the truth.

346
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,520
It seems that only he knows the secrets of the Luwang Palace.

347
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Oh, right.

348
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Third Uncle, do you still remember what I took out of the rock cave?

349
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,520
This is what I got from the corpse of the fox with my own eyes.

350
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,520
This is the key to the female corpse's mouth.

351
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Don't move.

352
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,520
This key is used to lock the door, not to unlock it.

353
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Otherwise, the mechanism will be triggered.

354
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,520
This is the oldest code box.

355
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Judging by its unlocking method, there should be eight numbers to unlock it.

356
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
I'm afraid we can't do it.

357
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Then what should we do?

358
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520
I'll go get Qi Ge and cut it open.

359
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
Try not to trigger the mechanism inside.

360
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
I'll go get Qi Ge and cut it open.

361
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
Try not to trigger the mechanism inside.

362
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
I'll go get Qi Ge and cut it open.

363
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
Try not to trigger the mechanism inside.

364
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Try not to trigger the mechanism inside.

365
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Try not to trigger the mechanism inside.

366
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

367
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

368
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

369
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

370
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

371
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

372
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

373
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

374
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

375
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

376
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

377
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

378
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

379
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

380
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

381
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

382
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

383
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

384
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

385
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

386
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

387
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

388
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

389
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

390
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

391
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

392
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

393
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

394
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
It's weird. What does this number mean?

395
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
It's open.

396
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

397
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Third Uncle, you know it?

398
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
Third Uncle, you know it?

399
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
It's my first time seeing this thing.

400
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
It's my first time seeing this thing.

401
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
I heard it from a expert.

402
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
But this thing is priceless.

403
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
But this thing is priceless.

404
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
This thing, whether it's material or design,

405
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
This thing, whether it's material or design,

406
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
It doesn't seem to be worth much.

407
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
You'd better leave it to the country.

408
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
Save the people from Aning from causing you trouble again.

409
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Save the people from Aning from causing you trouble again.

410
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
Or I can keep it for you.

411
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
Third Uncle, no need.

412
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
I'd better keep it for myself.

413
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
I'd better keep it for myself.

414
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
I still have things to do.

415
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
I still have things to do.

416
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
These two days, you and Chengcheng and Haishao,

417
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
You can't keep them.

418
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Third Uncle,

419
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
What about the book of the incense?

420
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Throw it away.

421
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
It's all fake anyway. It's useless to keep it.

422
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
I'll go.

423
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Actually, think about it.

424
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
That Prince Lushan is quite pitiful.

425
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,520
You say, he's been scheming all his life.

426
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
You say, he's been scheming all his life.

427
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
In the end, he was betrayed by his own family.

428
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Then the courage in his hand was all gone.

429
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
Who told him to do so many bad things?

430
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Haishao, aren't you curious?

431
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Haishao, aren't you curious?

432
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
How did Wu Xie get in touch with that demoness?

433
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
How did Wu Xie get in touch with that demoness?

434
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Wu Xie doesn't want to talk about his experience.

435
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Wu Xie doesn't want to talk about his experience.

436
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
I think it's a shadow.

437
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Fortunately, I didn't go.

438
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Then what is more important than

439
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
the body of Iron-faced Master?

440
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
The body of Iron-faced Master?

441
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
It's useless to ask.

442
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Do you think Wu Xie is very weird?

443
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Since he came back, he's been locking himself in the room.

444
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Since he came back, he's been locking himself in the room.

445
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
Let's go see him.

446
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Let's not.

447
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Look at his worried look.

448
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
He's very annoying.

449
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
You're hungry again?

450
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
In West Lake, you ate more than I did.

451
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
In West Lake, you ate more than I did.

452
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Now you eat so many chips.

453
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
You're a magical creature.

454
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
You don't know this.

455
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
I'm telling you.

456
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
There's an ancient Chinese saying.

457
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
It's called a real foodie is a good man.

458
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
It's called a real foodie is a good man.

459
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
It seems to have such a saying.

460
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
What does that mean?

461
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
It means

462
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
that only when you eat well and eat well

463
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
can you do great things.

464
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
That's the first big thing.

465
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Let's go eat.

466
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,520
That's a good saying.

467
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Let's go.

468
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Hurry up. I'm starving.

469
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
Wu Xie, let's eat.

470
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
What's wrong?

471
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
I can't eat.

472
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Is this the treasure in the gold box?

473
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
Is this the treasure in the gold box?

474
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
This thing is called the snake's tail.

475
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
This thing is called the snake's tail.

476
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
What did you find out?

477
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Nothing.

478
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Even grandpa's notebook.

479
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
Even grandpa's notebook.

480
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
Did you find third uncle?

481
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
What did he say?

482
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
Third uncle only knows the name.

483
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Nothing else.

484
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
It's weird.

485
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
There's something your third uncle doesn't know.

486
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
I always feel that third uncle is strange.

487
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
I always feel that third uncle is strange.

488
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
He's probably hiding something from me.

489
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
He's probably hiding something from me.

490
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
What did he say?

491
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
When he saw the snake's tail today,

492
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
When he saw the snake's tail today,

493
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
he looked very serious.

494
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
If he was just a simple

495
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
and valuable treasure,

496
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
in the third uncle's character,

497
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
he would annoy me.

498
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
But he didn't say anything today.

499
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
He said he would give it to the country

500
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
so that he wouldn't cause trouble.

501
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
It's too strange.

502
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Besides, the snake's tail is the same fish's name.

503
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
I don't think many people know.

504
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
I didn't find anything

505
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
about this thing in my grandpa's notebook.

506
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
But look at this notebook.

507
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
It's missing a few pages.

508
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
I always feel that these pages are related to this fish.

509
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
Could it be that your grandpa

510
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
wrote the wrong words?

511
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Or maybe he put sauce on it when he ate pasta.

512
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
So he tore these pages.

513
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
I always do that.

514
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
I don't think so.

515
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Look at the time before and after

516
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
this missing page.

517
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
The notebook is missing from this page

518
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
to here.

519
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
It's been three years

520
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
since it was calculated according to the year.

521
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
What did my grandpa do in the past three years?

522
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Maybe he didn't want

523
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
the future generations to know.

524
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
I don't think this is just a simple question.

525
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
Please help me check it online.

526
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
Could it be that

527
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
as you said,

528
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Ning and Xia Mu

529
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,520
didn't do it for the ghost,

530
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
or the tomb,

531
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
or the Qilin Festival,

532
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
but for the snake's tail?

533
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
What did you say? The snake's tail is the same fish?

534
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
You heard about it?

535
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
I saw this thing in my aunt's notebook.

536
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Really?

537
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
What does it say?

538
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
What is it?

539
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
In the aunt's notebook, it says

540
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
they spent a lot of time and energy to find the snake's tail.

541
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
They also sacrificed a lot of people. It's very important.

542
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
But I didn't say how to use it.

543
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
It's here again.

544
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
Where did you find it?

545
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
In the tomb of King Lushan.

546
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
It seems that aunt was only missing one.

547
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
Did you tell your uncle?

548
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
What did he say?

549
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
He didn't say anything.

550
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
How is that possible?

551
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
He must know about this.

552
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
I think he doesn't want to tell us.

553
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
It doesn't matter.

554
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
We can find a way to let him tell us.

555
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
Uncle.

556
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,520
Uncle, we've been waiting for you for a long time.

557
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,520
You're back.

558
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
I brought you some delicious food.

559
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Why are you here?

560
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
Uncle, sit down.

561
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
It's not easy for you to escape from the tomb.

562
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,520
So I cooked a meal for you.

563
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
Wait a minute.

564
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
What do you want?

565
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
What do you want?

566
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
What about you?

567
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
Eat.

568
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
Eat?

569
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
It's time to eat.

570
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,520
Let's eat.

571
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
Is the food I cooked delicious?

572
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
Uncle, it's delicious.

573
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
Come on.

574
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
Drink some wine.

575
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Come on.

576
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
Stop.

577
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
What's the matter?

578
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
Tell me.

579
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Nothing.

580
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Haisheng, what's the matter?

581
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Nothing.

582
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
What about you?

583
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
Eat the same meal.

584
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
Yes, eat the same meal.

585
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
You scared me.

586
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,520
Come on.

587
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
You brat.

588
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
You want to hide it from me?

589
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
It's too hard.

590
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
I didn't hide it from you.

591
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
Today is the day we eat together.

592
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
Yes.

593
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Come on, let's eat.

594
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,520
Let's eat.

595
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,520
Uncle, eat a chicken wing.

596
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Okay.

597
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
Okay.

598
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
You guys are so careless.

599
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
You don't have to guess.

600
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
You don't have to guess.

601
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
Do you want to know

602
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
about the snake and the fish?

603
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
So you already know

604
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
our purpose.

605
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,520
Did you want to

606
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
tell us

607
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
what happened?

608
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
I...

609
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
have nothing to say.

610
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Because I don't know anything.

611
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Uncle,

612
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
don't joke with us.

613
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
How is that possible?

614
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
My aunt has been looking for the snake and the fish.

615
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
You don't know it, do you?

616
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
Not only your aunt

617
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
is looking for the snake and the fish,

618
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
many people are looking for the snake and the fish.

619
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
What about the snake and the fish?

620
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
I saw it on a paper

621
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,520
that was not burned.

622
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
Since you want to know,

623
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
I'll tell you.

624
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
I'll let you die.

625
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Have you heard about the Jiu Men?

626
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,520
I know.

627
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
The joint organization of the Dao Mu Shi family.

628
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
It's not really a organization.

629
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
It's just a code

630
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,520
that the people in the martial arts world gave them.

631
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Actually,

632
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
there is not much connection between the Jiu Men.

633
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
Our Wu Family is just one of them.

634
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,520
And you,

635
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,520
Chen Chen Cheng's Chen Family is also one of them.

636
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520
Our family is one of the members of the Lao Jiu Men?

637
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
What do you think?

638
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Then why

639
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
no one has told me since I was a child?

640
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
I heard from my family

641
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
that it was actually

642
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
easy to understand.

643
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
Look, Uncle, he's so good.

644
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
It's strange that you two don't have any contact.

645
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
Right, Uncle?

646
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
What do I count?

647
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Actually, the Wu Family of the Lao Jiu Men

648
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
is talking about Wu Xie's grandfather.

649
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,520
My grandfather?

650
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,520
The Wu Family has been

651
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
in this industry since the Qing Dynasty.

652
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
Your grandfather's generation

653
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
has been fighting alone in Changsha.

654
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,520
Your grandfather had an accident

655
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,520
when he was a teenager.

656
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
His nose was lost.

657
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,520
He trained the little dog to replace his nose.

658
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,520
The name of Ge Wu Ye came from there.

659
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
People called him

660
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,520
Wu Lao Dog from that time.

661
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
The Lao Jiu Men are actually

662
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,520
divided into the upper three, the lower three and the lower three.

663
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
Our Wu Family is the lower three.

664
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
Right, my grandfather is also.

665
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
Everyone calls him Chen Pi, Si Si, Si A Gong.

666
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Our family is also the lower three.

667
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Right.

668
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
The Lao Jiu Men were originally extremely loose.

669
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
The interaction between them is not very close.

670
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
However,

671
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
once they decided to work together.

672
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
That was something that

673
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
did not happen in the world at that time.

674
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
It was also the biggest

675
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
Tao Mu action in history.

676
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
But I don't know

677
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
what exactly they did.

678
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
My grandfather didn't tell you?

679
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,520
In a winter when I was a child,

680
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
my grandfather suddenly said he was going out.

681
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
So I asked him,

682
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
where are you going?

683
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
He said he was going out for three months.

684
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,520
Who knew that it would be three years

685
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
after he went out.

686
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
When I saw him again,

687
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,520
he was already like another person.

688
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
He became as thin as a wood,

689
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
and was very delicate.

690
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
He was very gentle.

691
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
He was very kind.

692
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,520
He was very gentle.

693
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
No one knew what happened in his three years.

694
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
He never mentioned this.

695
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
I was still young at that time.

696
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
I was full of curiosity.

697
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
So when my grandfather went out,

698
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
I peeked at his notes.

699
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
It was written in the notes.

700
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,520
What was recorded?

701
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,520
I don't know.

702
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Because I haven't finished reading it,

703
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
he hung me up and beat me.

704
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
Then he burned the notes.

705
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
Since then,

706
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
no one in the Wu family has dared to mention this.

707
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
So that's it.

708
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
No wonder.

709
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
No one in our family has ever mentioned this.

710
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,520
No one in our family has ever mentioned this.

711
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
It's because they never say it.

712
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,520
I had to check it myself.

713
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
I was the same as you guys back then.

714
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,520
I didn't check it and I didn't want to.

715
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,520
I didn't check it and I didn't want to.

716
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
So I kept investigating this matter in secret.

717
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,520
So I kept investigating this matter in secret.

718
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,520
But there was no result.

719
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,520
But the old nine gates

720
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
because of the three years of action,

721
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,520
caused a great damage to the original spirit.

722
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,520
Since then,

723
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,520
the old master has ordered

724
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
that the Wu family

725
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,520
should not go to the Daoist School.

726
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
Our Chen family too.

727
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,520
It was not true for a few years.

728
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,520
It turns out to be like this.

729
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
The snake and the copper fish

730
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,520
are indeed important clues

731
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
for that action.

732
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,520
But I really don't know

733
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,520
how to use it.

734
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
If you don't even know,

735
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,520
no one in this world will know.

736
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,520
Now the only person who knows this secret

737
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,520
is the descendant of the old nine gates.

738
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,520
That is, the old lady of the Huo family

739
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,520
who was the third lady of the Huo family back then.

740
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,520
who was the third lady of the Huo family back then.

741
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,520
It is said that the Huo family

742
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,520
started a business in Beijing

743
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
after the Danchu River.

744
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,520
It seems that

745
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,520
we should go to Beijing.

746
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,520
What are you going to do?

747
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Go to find the old lady of the Huo family.

748
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,520
Wu Xie,

749
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,520
you are too naive.

750
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,520
What kind of person is the old lady of the Huo family?

751
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,520
Is the Huo fairy so easy

752
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
for you to see?

753
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Even if you see it,

754
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
will she listen to you?

755
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,520
That is not necessarily.

756
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,520
I tell you all this

757
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,520
is to hope that you don't have to endure the same things.

758
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,520
Don't you understand?

759
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,520
But third uncle...

760
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Enough. This matter ends here.

761
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
I have told you everything I know.

762
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
If you insist on finding the Huo family,

763
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
then from now on, I will make an excuse with you.

764
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Don't ask me for help anymore.

765
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Third uncle.

766
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
I finally asked for some clues.

767
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
I didn't expect third uncle to have such a big reaction.

768
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
I think

769
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,520
third uncle may not have lied to us.

770
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Could it be that

771
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,520
this snake and the mermaid can't really touch it?

772
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,520
The most important thing is

773
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
that third uncle has already

774
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
clearly told us

775
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
not to let you participate in this business.

776
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
I think

777
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
we should not let him.

778
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
I think

779
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
we should not let him.

780
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
Third uncle told us

781
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
not to let you participate in this business.

782
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
What should we do?

783
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
Even if third uncle doesn't recognize me as his eldest nephew,

784
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,520
I must make it clear.

785
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,520
Third uncle,

786
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,520
don't forget to come back and look for Haoyue school.

787
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
I plan to go with the second uncle

788
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
and be pressure with the third uncle once I make it right.

789
00:34:59,520 --> 00:34:59,920
Alright.

790
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,520
Okay.

791
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
Third uncle,

792
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
I'm counting on you.

793
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,520
I'm counting on you.

794
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,520
Third uncle,

795
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
Let's go.

796
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Haoyue volleyball school

797
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,080
This Pan Jiayuan is the most popular

798
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,280
ancient trade market in the country.

799
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,680
Look at the things here.

800
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,800
It's hard to change the real and fake.

801
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,880
Even the people in that industry

802
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,480
are easy to buy the fake.

803
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,840
There are so many tourists today.

804
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,800
There are also many cheaters.

805
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,200
I think Haishao is going to be cheated again.

806
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,800
Let's go and see.

807
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,640
One thousand and two.

808
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,880
One thousand and five.

809
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,280
One thousand and three.

810
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,440
No, no.

811
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
One thousand and five.

812
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,840
One thousand and four.

813
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,000
No, no.

814
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,040
One thousand and five.

815
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,960
Okay, okay, okay.

816
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,240
Pan Jiayuan is really precious.

817
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,640
I just came and I got an antique.

818
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,200
Look, this is made of jade.

819
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,880
This hairpin is really good.

820
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,080
Uncle, how much do you plan to sell it to us?

821
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,040
Uncle, it's my first time here.

822
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,560
He gave me a big discount.

823
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,840
The original price is three thousand.

824
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,400
The current price is only one thousand and five.

825
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,480
Wu Xie, I remember you said

826
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,160
that the jade is better and better.

827
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,920
Look at this one.

828
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,800
It's a good quality, isn't it?

829
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,160
I think this young man is a real man.

830
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,280
I said, Haishang,

831
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,320
if you're alone

832
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,800
in Pan Jiayuan for a day,

833
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,840
I guess everyone here

834
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
can recognize you.

835
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,320
Hey, little girl,

836
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,320
let me tell you.

837
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,320
I'm not lying to you.

838
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,400
Look at this jade.

839
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,000
It's good color and rich in water.

840
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,080
You should buy it.

841
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,440
Let me tell you.

842
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,400
This jade can feed people.

843
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,760
It can feed you to the point of water.

844
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,760
By then,

845
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,600
whoever sees it will like it.

846
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,160
Thank you, uncle.

847
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,280
This hairpin is really good.

848
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,840
But it's just a piece of jade.

849
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,040
It's just a piece of jade.

850
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,280
You'll know the weight after you touch it.

851
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,560
As for whether it's from Qing Dynasty or not,

852
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,880
I think you know better than us.

853
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
What did you say?

854
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,560
You lied to me.

855
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,760
Haishang, you're too quick-witted.

856
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,720
But I think this hairpin is pretty good.

857
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,400
I thought it was a big bargain.

858
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,600
The jade is also a piece of jade.

859
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,720
If you really like it,

860
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
just buy it.

861
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,400
But the price...

862
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
Yes, uncle.

863
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,840
Young man, you're so strict.

864
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,720
If you really want it,

865
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,640
here's the deal.

866
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,600
150 yuan is yours.

867
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
I'm here

868
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,000
just to eat.

869
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,080
I have several people to feed at home.

870
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,800
It's 150 yuan for 3,000 taels of silver.

871
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Do you want it or not?

872
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,640
Uncle, 150 yuan is too expensive.

873
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,160
Just one price. 100 yuan, okay?

874
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,640
Do you still need 50 yuan?

875
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,800
That's it. 100 yuan.

876
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,520
Here you are.

877
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,120
Okay.

878
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,440
Thank you, uncle.

879
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,120
Let's go.

880
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,160
It's so cost-effective.

881
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,560
Although it's fake,

882
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
it's really beautiful.

883
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,760
It's yours.

884
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,480
I'm not suitable for such a classic jewelry.

885
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,800
You should keep it yourself.

886
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,120
When you meet a beautiful girl,

887
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
you can send it out.

888
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,560
Okay.

889
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,760
It's so fun here.

890
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,880
I'll go shopping by myself.

891
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,640
See you later.

892
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,760
Be careful. Don't be fooled again.

893
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,880
I won't.

894
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,960
I should just follow her.

895
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,120
I'm experienced. Don't worry.

896
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,360
See you later, fat guy.

897
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,040
See you later.

898
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,600
Boss,

899
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,920
you have to look carefully.

900
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,560
This is a real one.

901
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,200
It's rare.

902
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,120
I've seen too many jewelry.

903
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,000
You...

904
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,520
At most, it's a piece of silk.

905
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,880
You...

906
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,080
Do you know how to sell it?

907
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,600
You should just sweep the yard.

908
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,920
I've been walking in the martial arts world for so many years.

909
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,600
I've seen too many jewelry.

910
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,600
I've never seen it before.

911
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,080
Think about it.

912
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
If I hadn't rushed to sell it today,

913
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,360
you wouldn't have had this chance.

914
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,560
There's nothing to think about.

915
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:37,360
Of course there is.

916
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm yet to see it.

917
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
I'm not a man.

918
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,880
Boss, take a look at your treasure.

919
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,800
It's rare.

920
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,280
What's so rare?

921
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,800
It's just a piece of silk.

922
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,240
Boss,

923
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,840
you're wrong this time.

924
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,520
It's not a silk item.

925
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,360
It's a bronze statue

926
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,040
that's preserved in a more complete way.

927
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,000
The flat bottom is straight.

928
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,960
It's just a little bit late.

929
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,440
It should be a work from the late Shang Dynasty.

930
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,240
Look at the pattern on its abdomen.

931
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,080
It should be similar to the one in Anhui in 1965.

932
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,120
The most exciting PG game

933
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,560
on the online site of

934
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,680
Aomei New Peking Entertainment City 772772.

935
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,960
The queen of rewards,

936
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,720
the gold-guaranteed city,

937
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,720
the talented cat,

938
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,200
the gold captain,

939
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,600
and so on.

940
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,640
The reward frequency is high.

941
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,520
There are many opportunities to take revenge.

942
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,960
Join the Aomei New Peking Entertainment City 772772.

943
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
Uncle.

944
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,720
Is it big enough?

945
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,480
The rushes will come upon us right away!

946
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,960
What rocket launchers?

947
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,320
No matter what is meant to take a shot,

948
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,360
I'll directly send those pulled wet misery

949
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,040
and dispossesse to kill the brave ones.

950
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,240
I'll already send the best people to die.

951
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,000
Brother,

952
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,120
it's not a dog- GRÜNENbye still.

953
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,280
How much is this?

954
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,560
300,000 yuan.

955
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
300,000 yuan?

956
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
It's not expensive.

957
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,440
And this has not appeared in China yet.

958
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,280
Maybe there will be a lot of space in the future.

959
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,960
It's a pity that I don't have so much money now.

960
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,280
How about this?

961
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,200
Come on.

962
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,400
Look at you.

963
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,080
You took it sincerely, right?

964
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,160
I can't let you run for nothing.

965
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,520
How about this?

966
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
300,000 yuan.

967
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,680
I'll take it for free.

968
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,160
I've sold it to this little brother.

969
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,120
No, you didn't hear that.

970
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,920
He didn't bring so much money.

971
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,960
Yes.

972
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,640
You sell it to me first.

973
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,720
If he likes it in the future,

974
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,760
he can come to me and buy it.

975
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:27,960
Come on.

976
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,960
I'm afraid it's not this price.

977
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,240
At most 310,000 yuan.

978
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,920
If you don't believe me,

979
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,320
I'll give you a word, okay?

980
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,560
Okay.

981
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,520
Write one.

982
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,480
Write it.

983
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:44,920
Come on.

984
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,480
Write.

985
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,480
Don't fool me.

986
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,560
It's 300,000 yuan.

987
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,520
Stop talking.

988
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,400
I don't believe you.

989
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,080
Open your misty eyes

990
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,520
Here comes another fight

991
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,520
There's a stormy night

992
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,920
Before the morning arrives

993
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,760
No matter where you go

994
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,000
I will follow you

995
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,800
I will follow you

996
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,600
I will follow you

997
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,600
I will follow you

998
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,200
Keep careful watch

999
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,800
Of your soul

1000
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,600
Smashing through the door

1001
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,240
Into another world

1002
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,880
Picking up my sword

1003
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,560
Nothing I can conquer

1004
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,560
Carry on

1005
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,560
We have to be strong

1006
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,560
Still a long long way to go

1007
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,960
Until I see the sun

1008
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,160
I see the light

1009
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,760
I hear the triumph

1010
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,560
Let's solve the mystery

1011
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,560
And live a dream

1012
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,560
I see the light

1013
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,560
I hear the triumph

1014
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,560
Let's write our story

1015
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,560
Let's make our fantasy

1016
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,560
Come true

1017
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,600
Don't fool me

1018
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,560
It's 300,000 yuan

1019
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,760
Don't fool me

1020
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,260
Keep careful watch

1021
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,560
Be careful watch

1022
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,160
Keep careful watch

1023
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,960
The previous defeat

1024
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,960
We carry on

1025
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,960
We had to be strong

1026
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Still a long long way to run

1027
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,960
Until I see the sun

1028
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,960
I see the light

1029
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,960

I see the light

1038
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,960
I hear the triumph

1039
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,960
Let's solve the mystery

1040
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,960
And live a dream

1041
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,960
I see the light

1042
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,960

Come true

1046
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,960
Come true
