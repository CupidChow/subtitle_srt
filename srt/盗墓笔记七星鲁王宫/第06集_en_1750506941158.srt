What are you doing?

108
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,480
He's got a needle in his stomach.

109
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,800
Why are you looking at me?

110
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480

You're lucky.

118
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,960
It's just some small poison.

119
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,880
If you don't disinfect, you'll get infected.

120
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,520
Come on.

121
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,120

Keep your voice down.

141
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,760

I've been healing for a long time, but I haven't moved.

174
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I don't think I've been able to keep up.

175
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Wu Xie, did you receive it?

176
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
My family's signal is strong.

177
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Why is it so dark in here?

178
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
I said, be quiet.

It's up there.

191
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
No, Han Shou, this...

192
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
Why did a Fatty Wang suddenly appear?

193
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
You seem to recognize him.

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
He's the Fatty Wang who saved us in Inner Mongolia.

195
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
It's him?

196
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
How did he get in here?

197
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Enough.

198
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
I'm asking you seriously.

199
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
How did you get here?

200
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I followed Zuo An Ning to get here.

201
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Last time, when we were in Inner Mongolia,

202
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,960
I was afraid that there would be some conspiracy behind this woman.

203
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,960
So I followed her here after leaving Inner Mongolia.

204
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Why are you here?

205
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,960
We were afraid that they would steal cultural relics, so we came here.

206
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Then, is this our fate?

207
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Stop it.

208
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Fatty.

209
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,960
What happened to that blood man?

210
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Look at his clothes. He looks like someone from An Ning.

211
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
I don't know why,

212
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
but he became so f**king old.

213
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Look at this.

214
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
This...

215
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
When his hand touched my flesh,

216
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
I was so scared.

217
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
When his hand touched my flesh,

218
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,960
it was like burning. It hurt so much.

219
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Yes. His wound was black.

220
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
It was like he was smoked.

221
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
That's right.

222
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
He's so lucky.

223
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Did you two find the ghost?

224
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
The ghost is real.

225
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,960
You two didn't know about it,

226
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
so you came here, right?

227
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
You must know about the Lu Shang Wang.

228
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
I know about the Lu Shang Wang.

229
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
He's just a...

230
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
a pig king who can be hurt by the ghost soldiers.

231
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
What?

232
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Come on.

233
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
I'll give you a little explanation.

234
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
The so-called Lu Shang Wang,

235
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,960
the so-called ghost soldiers,

236
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
are just a bunch of bullies.

237
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
If I don't explain it to you,

238
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,960
you'll think it through, right?

239
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Didn't you say you came with Ning?

240
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,960
How did you know about the Lu Shang Wang?

241
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,960
What are you talking about?

242
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm a professional.

243
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
I never delay the preparation.

244
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Do you know that?

245
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Go on.

246
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Can you let me sit down and talk?

247
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Sit down.

248
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Let me tell you two.

249
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
The Lu Shang Wang,

250
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
instead of suppressing the ghost soldiers,

251
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
instead of suppressing a general,

252
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
it's better to say that the ghost is a thief.

253
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Do you know that?

254
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
It's said that his army

255
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
rest during the day and march at night.

256
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
And the capital,

257
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
while walking,

258
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
suddenly disappeared from somewhere,

259
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
and then suddenly emerged from somewhere.

260
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,960
And there are many places that emerged from the ground.

261
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Think about it.

262
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,960
The ancient people had a lot of superstitions.

263
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
So they spread it,

264
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
and spread it out to you.

265
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,960
But you came to a conclusion with this information.

266
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Isn't it too misguided?

267
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Not only this.

268
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Just now,

269
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,960
the Seven Stars Medical Officer that we saw,

270
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,960
there are records in history.

271
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Actually, that was invented by the tomb raiders.

272
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Do you know why?

273
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Because they felt that

274
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
when they were alive,

275
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
there were too many tombs.

276
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
They were afraid that they would be repaid after death.

277
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,960
So they set up this game.

278
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Then what do you know about the chief officer?

279
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,960
How can I know about the fat man?

280
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Let me tell you.

281
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
It's very simple.

282
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
You just get a stick,

283
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
and lift the lid a little.

284
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
You get a steel hook,

285
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
and put it in like this.

286
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Look at what the hook is.

287
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Isn't it just a knot?

288
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
But,

289
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,960
I'm afraid that the seven tombs that we saw,

290
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
none of them are real.

291
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Including this tomb,

292
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,960
it's probably fake.

293
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Actually,

294
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,960
I didn't understand it at first.

295
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Until,

296
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,960
I fell into this tomb raider maze.

297
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
I suddenly found out

298
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,960
that this was a Xi Zhou tomb.

299
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
I was so confused.

300
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
I was so confused.

301
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,960
It's probably a Xi Zhou tomb.

302
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
What?

303
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Xi Zhou tomb?

304
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Then it means that we're not in the escape passage.

305
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,960
But we're still in someone else's tomb.

306
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
I've already guessed it.

307
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Who would dig the escape passage like a maze?

308
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
But that's not right.

309
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,960
How could someone dig their own tomb

310
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,960
on someone else's tomb?

311
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
From Feng Shui's point of view,

312
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
it's really a good idea.

313
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
To put your tomb

314
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
on someone else's tomb.

315
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
What is it called?

316
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
It's called...

317
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Cang Long School, right?

318
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
I think it's this name.

319
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
If you cooperate with it,

320
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,960
and you don't get it,

321
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,960
it's especially good for Feng Shui.

322
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
So,

323
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,960
according to my analysis,

324
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,960
the coffin of this King of Lushang

325
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
is very likely

326
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,960
to be in this Xi Zhou tomb.

327
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
If you really know Feng Shui,

328
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
why would you be trapped here

329
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
like us?

330
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Oh, right, Pan Zi.

331
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Speaking of which,

332
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,960
why did you disappear suddenly?

333
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
I'm not sure.

334
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,960
At that time, I don't know what mechanism I ran into.

335
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,960
The whole person fell down.

336
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Later, I ran into you in the tunnel.

337
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
Where did Third Uncle go?

338
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
I don't know either.

339
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Fatty. Wang Fatty.

340
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
What's wrong?

341
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Tell me. How did you come down?

342
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Tell me the truth.

343
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Did you bring that blood man?

344
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Did I do anything wrong?

345
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Didn't you see it just now?

346
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
He hit me with a gun.

347
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Of course I ran away.

348
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
I was running,

349
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
and suddenly I felt someone chasing me.

350
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
I turned around and thought, isn't that Xiao Ge?

351
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Then Xiao Ge told me to stop moving.

352
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,960
He seemed to step on some kind of mechanism on the wall.

353
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
I thought he was going to save me.

354
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Who knows? So many bugs fell down.

355
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
He was going to kill me.

356
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Xiao Ge knows this blood man very well.

357
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
There must be something wrong with his identity.

358
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,960
I always thought that as long as he was here,

359
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
there would be a sense of security.

360
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
But after hearing you say that,

361
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
I also think that he knows a lot.

362
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,960
It seems that he can predict anything.

363
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Wu Xie.

364
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
Don't worry.

365
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Let's see it clearly first.

366
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Where did you go?

367
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Where is that blood man?

368
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,960
It must be that little woman.

369
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,960
This bug has a good appetite.

370
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
It's eating.

371
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Isn't this chasing after our blood man's arm?

372
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Of course.

373
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,960
A group of sticks chasing after him.

374
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Isn't this a bit strange?

375
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
They didn't even bite once.

376
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
They dare to come to the island of Lushan King.

377
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
They are looking for a bait.

378
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
Be careful.

379
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
He bit me.

380
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Don't move.

381
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Just a little bit of pain.

382
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Let's go.

383
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
I'll go.

384
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
I'll go.

385
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,960
I'll go.

386
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Be careful.

387
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
I'm going to kill you.

388
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Don't move.

389
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
I'll go.

390
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,560
Hey, Fatty, isn't he that An Ning?

391
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,860
Yes, that's right. It's that woman.

392
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,760
If not because she chased us,

393
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,760
we wouldn't have run away like rabbits in Inner Mongolia.

394
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,360
I know Fatty. I'm holding onto her. Don't move.

395
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,760
Hey, she didn't hurt me.

396
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,960
You're too naive.

397
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,560
Fatty, do you have a rope?

398
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Yes. What are you doing?

399
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,360
Get tied up.

400
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,860
If you don't get rid of this woman, who will you get? Hurry up.

401
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,260
She's already injured.

402
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:54,460
Wu Xie, you're naive. You're sick.

403
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,060
You're acting in a drama with me.

404
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,060
You're a hero, but you're already acting like a drama queen.

405
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,660
You two, I'll keep this for a while.

406
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Come.

407
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,460
Are you okay?

408
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,460
Don't touch me.

409
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,460
Slow down.

410
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,460
You're not skinned. What are you doing?

411
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,260
She has blood in her body.

412
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,560
Let's drink for three years, okay?

413
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,060
Okay.

414
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,560
Here's some lForce arena.

415
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,120
)!

416
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:35,740
Whatever, the

417
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,420
less

418
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,820
But now, it's already been taken out.

419
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,820
Zhong Zi.

420
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,520
Where are they?

421
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,620
Who?

422
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,320
My friends.

423
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,820
Those rotten garlics in your hand...

424
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,620
We only saw you once.

425
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,820
Xiao Qi.

426
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,420
Miss, what happened?

427
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,420
What is your purpose of coming here?

428
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,820
What cultural relics did you take?

429
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,420
We haven't gotten them yet.

430
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,620
Not yet.

431
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Little Third Master!

432
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,220
No way! How are you? Why are you dizzy again?

433
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
Little Brother!

434
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,020
Wu Xie!

435
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,220
The Poisonous Poison

436
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,420
What happened just now?

437
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,620
It's the poison of the Poisoned Crab.

438
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,220
How could I be poisoned by the Poisoned Crab?

439
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,420
Are you stupid? It must be that woman.

440
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,020
She bit the Poisoned Crab and it was poisonous.

441
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,820
Then she bit you and then she transmitted the poison to you.

442
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,220
You even saved her.

443
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,420
We can only temporarily suppress the poison.

444
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,420
You need treatment.

445
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,820
But this is the first time I've heard that human blood can cure diseases.

446
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,220
Why don't you give me one too? I'm on a diet.

447
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,620
There's still something in this tomb that can save her.

448
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,620
It's the same poison that can tell.

449
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,020
She's fine.

450
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,620
Why did Little Third Master have a problem?

451
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,220
The vaccine.

452
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,020
To prevent any accident, we injected the vaccine before the sunset.

453
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,020
This won't let the poison enter the blood.

454
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,620
But it's no use to anyone else.

455
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,420
No.

456
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,820
Hello? Han Shou, Han Shou, I'm listening to your reply.

457
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,020
Wu Xie needs treatment.

458
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,420
Don't talk.

459
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,220
Take off your earphones.

460
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,020
You're named Cai. You should be talking.

461
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,220
Han Shou, where did you go? Hurry and reply.

462
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,820
Wu Xie is dead.

463
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,220
Wu Xie.

464
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,420
Han Shou and Chen Chengcheng are in my hands.

465
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,820
From now on, you have to listen to me.

466
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,020
Or else, they'll die.

467
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,220
Hello?

468
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,620
Hello?

469
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,220
Don't move.

470
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,420
How dare you lie to me?

471
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,420
Why isn't there any sound?

472
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,020
It can't be.

473
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,020
No matter how bad the signal is, it can't be suddenly cut off.

474
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,420
Someone was talking in there. It doesn't sound like Han Shou.

475
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,020
Something must have happened.

476
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,220
What could have happened?

477
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,820
This wilderness.

478
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,220
Unless someone met a ghost.

479
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
Don't be so petty.

480
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,020
Han Ning, do you still have your companions up there?

481
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,620
Liu Tan.

482
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,420
They have a clan that has been guarding up there.

483
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,420
Could it be that they kidnapped Chen Chengcheng and Han Shou?

484
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,620
I don't know.

485
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,420
We've lost contact.

486
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,620
If there really are people who are still with you, will they hurt Chen Chengcheng and Han Shou?

487
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:00,620
The order I got is that I must return before it gets dark.

488
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,420
They won't wait for someone who hasn't returned.

489
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,620
If I don't go up there alive before it gets dark,

490
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,020
your friends will be in danger.

491
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,020
They will be left in the forest of the human world.

492
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,820
You're not pretending to be pretty. You want to get out of this forest?

493
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,620
Impossible.

494
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,620
We still have time.

495
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,220
No.

496
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,420
We must find another way out.

497
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,820
Stop it.

498
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,220
You guys are just talking nonsense.

499
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,420
Be careful.

500
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,020
Don't you worry.

501
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,620
They said you don't need to worry. Let's go.

502
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,420
Let's go.

503
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,420
Let's go.

504
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,220
I think that An Ning's men are getting more and more aggressive.

505
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,620
Hey, don't tell her about the blood. I'm afraid she won't be able to take it.

506
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,020
She will know the truth. But we need to get out of here first.

507
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,620
No matter what, I think this place is getting more and more dangerous.

508
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,820
Luo Qi, stay here longer.

509
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,220
Let's go.

510
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,220
Let me help you.

511
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,620
Don't push yourself too hard.

512
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,420
I said you don't need to worry about me.

513
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,620
I didn't mean anything else. You're a girl. You're injured like this.

514
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,820
You can't get out.

515
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,420
That's right. What's wrong with helping?

516
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,820
If you're not pregnant, don't push us.

517
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,420
Come.

518
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,020
No, no, no.

519
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,420
There's a way here.

520
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,220
There's a way. Don't wait for us.

521
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,820
Are you okay?

522
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,420
It's a pity that she's got a stomachache.

523
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,420
That... Brother Pan,

524
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,420
you've been biting your lips for 20 times.

525
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,020
Can't you finish your words in one breath?

526
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,020
This is called Lu.

527
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,420
Your Lu is like this.

528
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,220
This is a wall. This is called wall.

529
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,220
In English, it's wow. In Chinese, it's great wow.

530
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,820
Okay.

531
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,020
I'm going to go.

532
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,020
I'm going to go.

533
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,020
I'm going to go.

534
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,820
Forget it.

535
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,220
Our Lu doesn't look like this.

536
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,820
There's light inside.

537
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,820
Let's take down the wall first.

538
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,620
What kind of fire is this?

539
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,820
It's so late.

540
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,420
This place might lead to the outside.

541
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,220
No matter what, we have to find a way out.

542
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,420
This is simple.

543
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,020
We have to find a way out.

544
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,420
This is simple.

545
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,420
Let's go.

546
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,220
Don't get hurt.

547
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,220
Can you do it?

548
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,020
Can you?

549
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,420
You don't even ask. Who am I?

550
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,220
Can you do it or not?

551
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,820
Keep your voice down.

552
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,620
How did they know our names?

553
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,420
Could it be that they're also from the same gang?

554
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,020
Yes, it's them.

555
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,820
Why did you destroy these machines? Don't you want to keep in touch with Wu Xie?

556
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,620
Of course I do.

557
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,020
But you heard it earlier.

558
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,220
He's threatening Third Uncle and Wu Xie with us.

559
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,420
They're already in a dangerous situation in the tomb.

560
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,220
Let's not cause trouble.

561
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,020
That's right.

562
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,820
Fatty, don't waste time.

563
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,620
All right.

564
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,820
Go ahead.

565
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,820
I'll wait at the entrance.

566
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,820
You are already here.

567
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,220
Don't worry.

568
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,720
Don't turn around.

569
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,220
You'll plate it all over when you go back to Kolnag.

570
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,820
I can have a taste.

571
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,620
worthy person

572
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,780
Take off the mittens

573
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,220
and place it above.

574
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,120
Please pass the baton.

575
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,880
Hurry up.

576
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,920
Old Eight, Old Eight, where are you going?

577
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,000
Amen.

578
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,120
Not bad.

579
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,760
Don't just keep bragging about me.

580
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,960
I'm in pain. Get up and help me up.

581
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,560
The blood is here.

582
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,720
Hurry up and go.

583
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,200
Hurry up and go. Stop looking.

584
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Go.

585
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,400
Hurry up.

586
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,840
No way.

587
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,240
This is also called a path.

588
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,120
No matter if it's a path or not, we all have to go through it.

589
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,080
Little Third Master, you go first.

590
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,160
Hurry.

591
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
Stop looking. Hurry up and go.

592
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,160
Be careful.

593
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,240
Be careful.

594
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,480
Fatty, come here.

595
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,760
Hurry.

596
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,120
Hurry, Fatty. Give me your hand.

597
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,520
Hurry.

598
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,280
The blood is here. Hurry up.

599
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,320
Add more strength.

600
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,720
You're not strong enough.

601
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,800
You need to use more strength.

602
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,520
Are you okay, Fatty?

603
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,000
Don't lose weight.

604
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,400
Fatty.

605
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,360
Little Third Master, hurry up and go.

606
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,920
You guys go first.

607
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,560
Go.

608
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Go.

609
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,960
You guys go first.

610
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
Go.

611
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Go.

612
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
Go.

613
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
Go.

614
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Go.

615
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
Go.

616
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Go.

617
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Go.

618
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
Go.

619
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Go.

620
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Go.

621
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Go.

622
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Go.

623
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Go.

624
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Go.

625
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Go.

626
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Go.

627
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Go.

628
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
You guys go.

629
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,760
Go.

630
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
Go.

631
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Go.

632
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,400
Go.

633
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Go.

634
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Go.

635
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Go.

636
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Go.

637
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:24,400
I'm telling you, this must be the main chamber of Xi Zhou Mu.

638
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
The one lying there must be the body of the King of Lushan.

639
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,400
This old maid is really bad.

640
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,400
She's really good at making up for her mistakes.

641
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,400
She even knocked down her own head and put herself in it.

642
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,400
I'm lucky to have met you, Fatty.

643
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Today, I came to ask for your permission to know

644
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,400
what happened to Dou Dou.

645
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,400
That's right. What happened to Dou Dou didn't happen.

646
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
That's right.

647
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Why are you looking at me?

648
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,400
I'm here to protect Mu.

649
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
No, no, no, don't look at me.

650
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,400
It's best that it's like this.

651
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Where's that blood person?

652
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Where's Fatty?

653
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Is it blood?

654
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Where did the blood person come from?

655
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,400
This isn't the Northeast. It's blood, right?

656
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
You guys stay here and wait.

657
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
I'll go down and take a look.

658
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,400
I'll show you how Fatty Wang protects the cultural relics.

659
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Fatty, slow down.

660
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Be careful.

661
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Hold on tight.

662
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Hold on tight.

663
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Hold on tight.

664
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Slow down.

665
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
You guys wait for me up there.

666
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
I'll come down after I signal.

667
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Third Uncle! Third Uncle!

668
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Third Uncle!

669
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Wu Xie!

670
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
You little brat, where did you go?

671
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
I was so worried. Are you all right?

672
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,400
I'm fine. But Pan Zi is hurt.

673
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Chen Zhen Chen and Han Shao are also in danger up there.

674
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,400
That's right. You guys are all fine now.

675
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
The biggest trouble is me.

676
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Who are you? Third Uncle or Third Aunt?

677
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,400
Why are you lying with a flashlight when you're fine?

678
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Why are you laughing at yourself when you're fine?

679
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Nonsense!

680
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
What is this place?

681
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,400
If something happens, how am I supposed to know who's who?

682
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,400
You're just trying to save Wu Xie from the Inner Mongolia, right?

683
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Don't move.

684
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Don't fall if you're fine.

685
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Pan Zi, how's your injury?

686
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,400
It's not serious. Thank you, Third Uncle.

687
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Third Uncle, you just...

688
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Little Third Uncle!

689
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Little Third Uncle!

690
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Little Third Uncle!

691
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Little Third Uncle! What happened to Wu Xie?

692
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,400
He's poisoned by the Poison of the Ten-Bear. He's not in danger for now.

693
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Little Third Uncle, I'll find a place to go down.

694
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Watch Wu Xie for me.

695
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Didn't I tell you to wait for my signal to come down?

696
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Why are you in a rush?

697
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
It's not a rush.

698
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
I'm going to find a place to go down.

699
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Hurry up.

700
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
I must find a place.

701
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Hurry.

702
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Hurry!

703
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Hurry.

704
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Hurry.

705
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,400
Hurry.

706
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Hurry.

707
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Hurry.

708
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Hurry.

709
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Hurry.

710
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,800
This is the

711
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:10,780
Brotherня Kylemae's

712
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,420
golden Nobody

713
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,000
So you want to be a man

714
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,720
You are my touch

715
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,920
I don't care

716
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,980
My place ASL

717
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,700
High priest.

718
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:53,400

I'm sorry.

721
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,980
I'm sorry.

722
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,980
I wish you two a happy marriage.

723
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Let's get married soon.

724
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,980
Let's get married soon.

725
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,980
Let's go.

726
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,980
Stop!

727
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
Your hand is full of blood.

728
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,980
If you touch the corpse, you will die immediately.

729
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,980
Don't move!

730
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,980
Wu Xie

731
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,980
Wu Xie

732
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,980
Wu Xie

733
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,980
Wu Xie

734
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,980
Are you okay?

735
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,980
I'm fine.

736
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,980
Third Uncle

737
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,980
How did I fall?

738
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,980
I saved you.

739
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,980
Thank you.

740
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,980
You're welcome.

741
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
I'm fine.

742
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,980
There's something.

743
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
What is it?

744
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,980
This little thing is hard to call a key.

745
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,980
There's actually a female hen in this body.

746
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,980
Why is there a hen in the body?

747
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,980
Usually, the hen is placed in the body

748
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,980
to avoid someone taking away the pearl in her mouth

749
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,980
or the jade fan of the steel door.

750
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,980
As long as it is taken away, the hen will start immediately.

751
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,980
The arrow will break out immediately.

752
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,980
Because at this time, the distance between the human and the corpse is usually the closest.

753
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,980
I don't think it can be avoided.

754
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,980
Third Uncle

755
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,980
What should we do to get this key out?

756
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,980
Let me do it.

757
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,980
Wu Xie

758
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,980
Third Uncle

759
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,980
What's going on?

760
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,980
Macau New Beijing Entertainment City 772772

761
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,980
The most exciting PG game on the line.

762
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,980
The mahjong is over.

763
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,980
The mahjong is over.

764
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,980
The queen of the prize pool, the treasure of the golden city,

765
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,980
the talented cat, the captain of the prize pool,

766
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,980
and so on.

767
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,980
High rate of compensation, high rate of reward.

768
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,980
There are many opportunities to take revenge.

769
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,980
Hurry up and join.

770
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,980
Macau New Beijing Entertainment City 772772

771
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,980
TONG

772
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,980
This may be a way to store the corpse in the Miao River.

773
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,980
This corpse is like a container.

774
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,980
When you take the things in the container away,

775
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
there is no use for the container.

776
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,980
Key

777
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,980
What is this key used for?

778
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,980
If the key is on this corpse,

779
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,980
then this thing should be around her.

780
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,980
It should be around here.

781
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,980
Be careful.

782
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,980
I will follow you.

783
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:29,980
Keep careful watch of your soul.

784
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:38,980
Smashing through the door into another world.

785
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,980
Picking up my sword.

786
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,980
Nothing I can conquer.

787
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,980
I'll keep carrying on.

788
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,980
We have to be strong.

789
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,980
Still a long long way to go.

790
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,980
Until I see the sun.

791
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,980
I see the light.

792
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,980
I hear the triumph.

793
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,980
Let's solve the mystery.

794
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,980
And live a dream.

795
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,980
I see the light.

796
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,980
I hear the triumph.

797
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,980
Let's write our story.

798
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:41,980
Let's make our fantasy come true.

Smashing through the door into another world.

801

Picking up my sword.

802

I'll keep carrying on

804
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,980
We had to be strong

805
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,980
Still a long long way to run

806
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,980
