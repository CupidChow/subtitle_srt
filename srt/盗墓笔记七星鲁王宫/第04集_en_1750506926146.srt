You're awake.

10
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Little Third Master, we're out.

11
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Who hit me just now?

12
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I hit you, you brat.

13
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I told you not to turn around, but you still turned around. You want to kill us?

14
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Where's that female Zongzi?

15
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't worry, she's already gone.

16
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What is she?

17
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Little Third Master said her name is Lei. It's the soul of the White Silver Zongzi.

18
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
She wants to see your yang energy to get out of that stone.

19
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What's wrong with Little Third Master?

20
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
She just had too much blood and is now unconscious.

21
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Third Uncle, what is this Little Third Master's background? Why is he so good?

22
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This little guy doesn't talk much on the road.

23
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My friend is very famous in the martial arts world.

24
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The person he introduced is a good friend.

25
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Third Master, there's a village ahead.

26
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This village isn't that broken.

27
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There's even a light.

28
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's great!

29
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Then we can take a hot bath and have another big meal.

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm afraid there's no hotel in this village. There's only a horse shed.

31
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's fine if there's a horse shed. At least we can let everyone rest peacefully.

32
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
She's so soft, just like a woman.

33
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's like she has no bones.

34
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hurry up. It's getting dark. We have to find a way to get into the village.

35
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Ah.

37
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The most exciting PG game on the line.

38
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The mahjong is over.

39
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The mahjong is over 2.

40
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The prize-winning queen.

41
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The treasure-seeking golden city.

42
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The talented cat.

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The prize-winning captain.

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And so on.

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The super high rate of compensation.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The reward frequency is high.

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There are many opportunities to get revenge.

48
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000

Kid. Kid.

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Do you know the way to the village?

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Kid, tell us.

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll buy you something to eat.

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
50 pieces of meat.

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Come with me.

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This kid is quite smart.

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let's go.

58
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Little girl.

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Is there anything else in your village besides this hotel?

60
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
There are only thirty people in our village.

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is the best hotel.

62
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Is there a room?

63
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
There are two rooms. Do you want to stay?

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes.

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Kid needs to recuperate now.

66
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Wu Xie.

67
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You stay in the same room with him.

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The three of us will make up for it.

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's play a game.

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay.

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Right here.

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How many floors is this?

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There are only two rooms left.

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Wu Xie.

75
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Take care of the kid.

76
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Little girl, let's go back.

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wu Xie.

78
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Where is this?

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is the village's reception.

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You should rest first.

81
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Come, San Ying. Drink some water.

82
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Little girl.

83
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Drink some water.

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
San Ying, drink some water.

85
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Little girl, what do you want to eat tonight?

86
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Can you hurry up with the dishes?

87
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We are starving.

88
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay.

89
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Master, hurry up.

90
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay.

91
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Add some salted fish cakes.

92
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay.

93
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
San Shu.

94
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How is the kid?

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He is still resting in his room.

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
After we finish eating, I will bring some food back to him.

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You can't drink this.

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You will get dizzy.

99
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You can only drink this.

100
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
San Shu is right.

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I risked my life to protect this red bull.

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There is no such thing in this village.

103
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Stop talking nonsense.

104
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You also drink this.

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Hello.

106
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I am not in Hangzhou.

107
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You can talk.

108
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What are you doing?

109
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What are you doing?

110
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Come.

111
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Come.

112
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You can drink like this.

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It tastes good.

114
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You have a lot of ideas.

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Of course.

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's eat.

117
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Wait.

118
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's take a picture first.

119
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What picture? I am starving.

120
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Hurry up and eat.

121
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This is the first night before our action.

122
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It is very memorable.

123
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let's take a picture.

124
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's take a picture.

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's take a picture.

126
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Come.

127
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I am sorry to trouble you.

128
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Okay.

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Everyone, lean a little bit closer.

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay.

131
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Three, two, one.

132
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Cheese.

133
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Looks like our country's basic construction is doing very well.

134
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Look at this village.

135
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It is full of cement.

136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
There is electricity in the water.

137
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There are roadways outside.

138
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
A few years ago, the village was destroyed by the mountain.

139
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The road was blocked.

140
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Now, the cement is all built by the villagers.

141
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It is still not finished.

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What about the waterways?

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't you have a pier here?

144
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Where did the waterways come from?

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We haven't pulled the boat for decades.

146
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If someone still asks you to go to the waterways,

147
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
it must be a murder.

148
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Do you think his figure is a little familiar?

149
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Since you know so much,

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
are you a native here?

151
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What else do you know?

152
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes.

153
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Tell me.

154
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Are there many people here?

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Are you asking about the front or back of the waterways?

156
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
After the waterways were destroyed.

157
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There are still some details about the waterways?

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That year, the waterways were destroyed.

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
A big dam was built in the village.

160
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Experts came and saw it.

161
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
They said it was a cultural relic.

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They pulled the waterway away.

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Since then, the village has not been quiet.

164
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
All the people in and out of the village are foreigners.

165
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't think they are here to travel.

166
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Are they here to make a fuss?

167
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We are here to travel.

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Who are you lying to?

169
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If you are really here to travel,

170
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
you wouldn't be a burden to a big car outside.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We are not.

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I didn't expect you to know a lot.

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I was just kidding.

174
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't know a lot.

175
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You are missing in secret.

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We thought you were caught.

177
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I didn't expect you to come here alone to play the villagers.

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
How is it? Is it fun?

179
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You are amazing.

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You can recognize me even if I dress like this.

181
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay, okay.

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's my fault to leave without permission.

183
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You made us worried.

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why are you here?

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Third Uncle, I've always wanted to say sorry to you.

187
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I shouldn't have quarreled with you that day.

188
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Forgive me.

189
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Since you weren't kidnapped,

190
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
why did you mess up my house?

191
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He is just playing with kids' temper.

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Little temper?

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You are so bad tempered.

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You are exactly like your aunt.

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay, okay, Third Uncle.

196
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's good that you are fine.

197
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Third Uncle, look, I'm fine.

198
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Can I play with you tomorrow?

199
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Third Uncle, since Chen Zhenchen came here without any problems,

200
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
you shouldn't doubt his ability now, right?

201
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Okay, okay, okay.

202
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But you have to promise me.

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You go with us.

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
After we get down, you can't go down.

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Okay, okay.

206
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You can only wait up there.

207
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
If you can't do it, you can go back immediately.

208
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No problem, no problem.

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I will listen to you.

210
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Third Uncle.

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Introduce yourself.

212
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hello, this is my uncle.

213
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
My name is Chen Chengcheng.

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Pan Zi, you can call me wherever you want.

215
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Hello, hello.

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hello, hello.

217
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Sit, sit, sit.

218
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You, you, too.

219
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Chen Cheng, you don't walk on the water path.

220
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
How did you come here?

221
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Third Uncle, this is a long story.

222
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That day, I went back to Wu Xie's house

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and packed my luggage.

224
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I wanted to go to the ancient tomb alone.

225
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
As a result, I just left the city

226
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and met those Daomutuanghu.

227
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I followed them all the way

228
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and arrived at this village.

229
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Two days ago, they entered the forest.

230
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I was going to come and stay in the village

231
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
while asking for news and waiting for them to come out.

232
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Unexpectedly, I waited for you first.

233
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What news did you hear?

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There is an ancient tomb in this village.

235
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It is said that an immortal was buried here.

236
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
After he helped the emperor to finish the battle,

237
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
he left his body and weapons.

238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
In order to show his respect,

239
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
the emperor buried his body and weapons.

240
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't know if he was really an immortal.

241
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But his tomb is definitely not smaller than the emperor's tomb.

242
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Has anyone been in there?

243
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We can't go in there now.

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Because when the mountain was falling,

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
the place was also falling.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I heard that more than 100 people were there.

247
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
More than 100 people?

248
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Wait.

249
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Only people?

250
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
No body?

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's right.

252
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Did anyone go in there before the mountain was falling?

253
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes.

254
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Several groups of people.

255
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But I heard that when those people went in,

256
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
they were very fierce.

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
When they came out, they didn't bring anything.

258
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And they were all like drug dealers.

259
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I guess they didn't even find the tomb.

260
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's a good thing that they didn't find it.

261
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It seems that my third uncle is the one who lives in this tomb.

262
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yes, third uncle.

263
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Here, to you.

264
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Come, cheers.

265
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Come, come, come.

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Everyone, rest early.

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We'll set off early tomorrow morning.

268
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay.

269
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Where do you live?

270
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I live in the best room here.

271
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Why?

272
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Do you want to come to the bed?

273
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'd better live with Mei Youping.

274
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Mei Youping?

275
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Who is Mei Youping?

276
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Mei Youping?

277
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Mei Youping?

278
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Get up and eat.

279
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The tomb we're going to should be in that place.

280
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But I heard from Miss Chen just now.

281
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That road is now even difficult to walk in.

282
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Not to mention, we still have equipment.

283
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
There are ways to have equipment.

284
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
There are ways to have equipment.

285
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There are ways to have equipment.

286
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Chengcheng said that the place where the head of the person appears

287
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
is actually the old ancestors' ghost head pit.

288
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's also the old burial pit.

289
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Eat.

290
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This is the pork liver I ordered especially for you.

291
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's not salty.

292
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Is there water?

293
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yes.

294
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Here.

295
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Thank you.

296
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You're welcome.

297
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We're leaving tomorrow morning.

298
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Are you feeling well?

299
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm fine.

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Then eat slowly.

301
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Easy.

302
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Just sit.

303
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Actually, right now,

304
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
we're far from the tomb.

305
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The previous group of people,

306
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
according to the prison magic,

307
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
believed that this place was a dragon's head.

308
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Take a good look.

309
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We're walking from here to over here.

310
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Just the grow-up road.

311
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,400
Under the fake dragon's head, there must be many fake organs.

312
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,000
If we don't have this map, even if our ancestors come,

313
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm afraid we'll have to find a way.

314
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,500
Prepare the important things tomorrow.

315
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,800
We'll go to the town and collect the information.

316
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,200
Okay.

317
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,500
Mine

318
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,100
We have arrived.

319
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,100
Go back and play.

320
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Thank you, Sister Cui.

321
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Why are you laughing?

322
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,100
These kids are so kind to lead us.

323
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Go.

324
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,100
The river in front is blocked by this waterfall.

325
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,100
If you go through this place, you'll reach the head of the man.

326
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,100
We have to climb over these rocks now.

327
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
Everyone be careful.

328
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
All follow me.

329
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Go.

330
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
Brother.

331
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,100
Third Master, look.

332
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
Isn't that the man who led us into the cave?

333
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
Stop.

334
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
Stop.

335
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
This...

336
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
This...

337
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
This...

338
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
This...

339
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
This...

340
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
This...

341
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,100
Everyone, I really couldn't think of any other ideas.

342
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
I didn't expect that all of you are immortals.

343
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,100
I... I will never become a Tai Shan.

344
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Please spare my life.

345
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,100
How did that old man offend you?

346
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100
Shui Du.

347
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,100
I think you're pretty good at jumping around.

348
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
You can't do anything.

349
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,100
My body is really sick.

350
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100
Don't look at me as if I'm hard.

351
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,100
To be honest, I have to eat a lot of medicine every day.

352
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,100
I cut the wood to make medicine.

353
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,100
When we were in the cave, how did you suddenly disappear?

354
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,100
I said, Lord Jin Yuan, don't kill me.

355
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Don't worry. We won't kill anyone.

356
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
You have to give us a reason to kill someone, right?

357
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Yes, yes, yes. I'm honest. I'm honest.

358
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Actually, it's not a big deal.

359
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,100
There are many secret holes in the top of the cave.

360
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,100
If you don't investigate it carefully, you won't be able to find it.

361
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,100
When you didn't notice, I just stood up and went into the hole.

362
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,100
When our ship left, how did you get out?

363
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,100
After your ship left, I came out to blow the whistle.

364
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,100
That dog will drag a big wooden basin over.

365
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,100
I sat in the wooden basin and I slipped out.

366
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Oh, right.

367
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,100
It's all the idea of the ship's master, Lu Laor.

368
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
He took more than me.

369
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,100
This Lu...

370
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,100
Where's Lu Laor?

371
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
Where's Lu Laor?

372
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
I've sent him to report.

373
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,100
He's dead. He's dead.

374
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Actually, I don't want to do that.

375
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,100
But the ship's master, Lu Laor, said I wouldn't do it.

376
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
He even did it to me.

377
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,100
My lords, I've made it clear.

378
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,100
I really can't do anything.

379
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
Let me go.

380
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
Let me go.

381
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,100
What's the hurry?

382
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,100
Looks like you're familiar with this place.

383
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,100
We can let you go.

384
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
You must take us to the ancient tomb.

385
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,100
Ancient tomb?

386
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,100
Gentlemen, you can't go.

387
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,100
There are demons in there.

388
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
What? You've seen demons?

389
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,100
I took someone in a few days ago.

390
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
And then...

391
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
And then what?

392
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,100
They were all gone in one night.

393
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,100
How come?

394
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
I've been watching ghost movies since I was a kid.

395
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
Don't try to fool us with old stories.

396
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,100
This is absolutely true.

397
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,100
I don't want to go either.

398
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
But those people are both money and threats.

399
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
I can't just leave.

400
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100
We kept walking and walking.

401
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,100
And then they suddenly stopped and started a battle.

402
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
I slept so soundly that night.

403
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,100
I was so scared that I almost died.

404
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,100
When I woke up...

405
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
The tent was still there.

406
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
The fire was still burning.

407
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
I was screaming for a long time.

408
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,100
No one agreed.

409
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,100
I guess they came to take a walk.

410
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
Where did the monster come from?

411
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,100
Oh, my.

412
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100
Everyone.

413
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,100
I was about to run back.

414
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
I just ran a few steps.

415
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
And then a woman in the team came out of nowhere.

416
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,100
She was covered in blood.

417
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,100
I was so scared that I didn't even dare to turn around.

418
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
I ran back to the village.

419
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
I ran for a whole day and a night.

420
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
I don't want to go back to that place ever again.

421
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
I...

422
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Uncle San.

423
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,100
Do you think what he said is true or not?

424
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Half true and half not.

425
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Isn't it just a blood monster?

426
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
Let me tell you.

427
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,100
Our little brother has been kneeling down for him for a thousand years.

428
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
With him around,

429
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
no monster or demon will be in the picture.

430
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
Right?

431
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
I've been walking for a long time.

432
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,100
It's all mosquitoes.

433
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
When will they arrive?

434
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,100
Enough. Why are you always talking nonsense?

435
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,100
Do you think we need to be here?

436
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
Hurry up and go.

437
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,100
You guys stay here.

438
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,100
There they are!

439
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
These stinkers really came before.

440
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,900
All the accounts and the business cards on the bag were stolen by them.

441
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,300
It seems that they don't want others to know where they came from.

442
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,500
Look, they have everything they need in life.

443
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,700
They must have something to prepare.

444
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,300
Third Master, we didn't find anything.

445
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,900
There's no signal in the wireless shop.

446
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,500
Then there's no clue.

447
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,900
That's not true.

448
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,100
Since they can settle down here,

449
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,900
it means that the destination should be around here.

450
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,500
It seems that they have entered the tomb.

451
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,100
Then this time, you didn't lie to us.

452
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,900
That's right.

453
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,300
Third Master, let him go.

454
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,300
Anyway, we are very close to the tomb.

455
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,100
It's no use keeping him.

456
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,300
Let's go.

457
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,700
Thank you, everyone.

458
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,100
Let's go.

459
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,300
There are many places to enter here.

460
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,300
Only I can choose this path.

461
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,900
If we change the path,

462
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,300
maybe we can dig a hole in it.

463
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,700
Third Master, what about these equipment?

464
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,500
Take the gas away.

465
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
It might be useful to keep it.

466
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,500
Let's go.

467
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,900
Young man, don't always cry.

468
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,300
How can you practice with me with your strength?

469
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,100
Forget it.

470
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,500
You're out of your mind.

471
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,900
Third Master.

472
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,300
Come up.

473
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,500
Are you okay?

474
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,900
Dad, be careful.

475
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,900
What are you doing?

476
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,100
I didn't notice the bottom. Who knew there was a hole here?

477
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,500
Fortunately, it's just a shallow hole.

478
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,900
If it's a trap, you're dead.

479
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,500
Are you okay?

480
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,100
Why is there such a big shallow hole?

481
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,700
It's here.

482
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,700
We're standing in the right place.

483
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,500
I think this is the funeral altar.

484
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,300
You're just a temporarily

485
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,100
public wrap on the ground,

486
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,300
trying to kill the person that created these holes.

487
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,100
You're just an ordinary person.

488
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,900
He's just an ordinary person.

489
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,700
An ordinary citizen.

490
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,500
He's just like you,

491
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
this官僚's just a regular citizen.

492
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
A regular citizen should be okay with too many people.

493
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,300
If he goes to theoirs,

494
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,700
he'll probably have thousands of creatures living here.

495
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,500
Chief's the most stupid person.

496
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,700
That guy is not important to me.

497
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,380
How can we go down if we don't dig?

498
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,260
How about you try it?

499
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,140
You can't destroy the tomb anyway.

500
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,700
Look.

501
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,100
They blew up this place and entered the tomb from here.

502
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,700
But after they entered, this place collapsed.

503
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,500
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

504
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,900
If we delay any longer,

505
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,500
they might take a relic from inside and just dig a hole and leave.

506
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,900
Wu Xie, look at this hole. It's still not big.

507
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,900
Then I must go down the tomb.

508
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,900
Wu Xie, look at this hole.

509
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,900
It's still not big.

510
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

511
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,700
If we delay any longer,

512
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,900
they might take a relic from inside and just dig a hole and leave.

513
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

514
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,900
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

515
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,900
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

516
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

517
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,900
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

518
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,900
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

519
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,900
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

520
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,900
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

521
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,100
Wu Xie, look at this hole.

522
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,100
It's still not big.

523
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

524
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

525
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

526
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

527
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

528
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

529
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

530
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

531
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

532
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

533
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

534
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

535
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,260
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

536
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,660
I'm afraid we can't go down this path.

537
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,140
You dirty highest rock!

538
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,140
What the hell are you doing, Kan牙?

539
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,140
I'm going to kill you.

540
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,660
I'm after classic ha帶,

541
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,660
cyclops and developed land ocur vendor...

542
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,660
We ended up on the Sao Hao sea.

543
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,660
에서도 pores spray gun...

544
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,660
You talk too much, Kan牙...

545
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,660
Why does the picture seem to have blood?

546
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,460
Let's start.

547
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,460
Uncle San, do you need our help?

548
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,260
You're inexperienced, so don't mess around.

549
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,060
Let's go to the tent.

550
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,860
Okay.

551
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,860
You go ahead. I'll watch here.

552
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,660
Okay.

553
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,460
Let's go.

554
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,460
Let's go.

555
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,660
Here.

556
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,060
Fatty, it's here.

557
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,860
Get it done.

558
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,460
Okay.

559
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,060
Han Shou, are you not going down?

560
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,260
I'm not going down.

561
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,260
We're at the door. You really aren't going down?

562
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,460
I don't want to meet any more dead bodies

563
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,460
or ever-changing rice dumplings.

564
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,660
That's good.

565
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,060
Then, you stay up there with Cheng Cheng.

566
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,060
You must take good care of her.

567
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,460
Don't worry. I'll be up there.

568
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,660
I'll be your backup.

569
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,260
What backup can you be?

570
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,860
The most important thing for you is to protect Cheng Cheng Cheng.

571
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,460
Forget it. I'm pretty much protecting her.

572
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,460
You can rest assured.

573
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:45,860
Here.

574
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,060
What is this?

575
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,460
This is a camera.

576
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,060
After I put it on, I can see what's going on down there.

577
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,260
Camera?

578
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,660
You really think I'm a photographer?

579
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,260
You two be careful up there.

580
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,660
There might be wild beasts nearby.

581
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,060
We should hurry back before it gets dark

582
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,460
to avoid the villagers from suspecting us.

583
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,460
Let's go.

584
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,660
Be careful.

585
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,260
Xiao Ge, you're going down?

586
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,860
Wu Xie, I know I can't stop you.

587
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,260
But you must listen to me after you go down.

588
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,060
Don't go anywhere and don't touch anything.

589
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,660
Don't worry, Uncle San. I'll listen to you.

590
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,060
Let's go down then.

591
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,660
Let's go.

592
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,660
Let's go.

593
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,860
Let's go.

594
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,060
Will it be poisoned to death?

595
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,860
San Ye, this mechanism opens from both sides.

596
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,860
Let's go.

597
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,660
Uncle San, it's closed.

598
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,860
Calm down.

599
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,060
In order to prevent the ancient tomb from collapsing,

600
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,260
there must be a passage at the bottom of the tomb.

601
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,060
When we leave, find it.

602
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,460
Just make a tunnel and go out from there.

603
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,460
I'll go with you.

604
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,460
You go with me.

605
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,660
You go with me.

606
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,860
I'll go with you.

607
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,060
You go with me.

608
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,260
I'll go with you.

609
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,460
I'll go with you.

610
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,660
I'll go with you.

611
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,860
I'll go with you.

612
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,060
I'll go with you.

613
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,260
I'll go with you.

614
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,660
I'll go with you.

615
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,460
I'll go with you.

616
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,660
There's no path left or right.

617
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,860
The main tomb master should be behind the wall.

618
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,260
Don't move.

619
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,100
We are hiding here,

620
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,620
we have to get our bricks finally.

621
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,840
You cannot push it,

622
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,380
or that can't be hits.

623
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:27,020

We have to be strong

649
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,520
Still a long long way to go

650
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,520
Until I see the sun

651
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,520
