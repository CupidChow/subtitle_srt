The End

74
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This notebook

75
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
was left by my grandfather.

76
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It recorded

77
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
countless stories

78
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
that made me doubtful.

79
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I call it

80
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
the Dao Mu Notebook.

81
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It was a time of chaos and chaos.

82
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Grandfather and grandmother

83
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
had to use the cultural relics

84
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
that they had dug out

85
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
to exchange for food.

86
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Every time I heard about it,

87
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was fascinated by it.

88
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The prophecy that grandfather wrote

89
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
was all on me.

90
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In the middle of the night,

91
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
this notebook

92
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
took me into that mysterious

93
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and dangerous Dao Mu world.

94
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The End

95
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The End

96
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The End

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Who are these people?

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
They are so mysterious.

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The point is that they are not stubborn.

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They have been chased by the Inner Mongolia.

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's all your fault.

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Your high-tech positioning system

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
is so evil.

104
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If it wasn't for it,

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
we wouldn't be in such a mess.

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Who said that we should

107
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
rely on high-techs when we go out?

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What do we rely on?

109
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We can't rely on anything now.

110
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Did you say that

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
we would be in such a danger?

112
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The target is in danger.

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't hurt that Wu.

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't hurt him.

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Wu Xie.

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Wu Xie.

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
How are you?

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm fine.

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000

The most famous man in the martial arts world, Wang Fatty.

156
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
You two little kids want to call me Fatty to save money?

What's your name, Fatty?

158

My name is Hai Xiao. He's Wu Xie.

159

Thank you, Fatty, for saving us.

160
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Be more precise.

161
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
It's Fatty. Not Fatty.

162
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Isn't that for the sake of the peace?

163
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Fatty!

164
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320

Take it!

176
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
They're pretty fast.

178
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
They're pretty fast.

179
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
They're pretty fast.

180
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Hold on tight.

181
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,760
That's it!

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Hurry!

183
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
My long shot!

184
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,900
You really fell for it.

185
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,220
I think you should be careful.

186
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,940
But they'll still teach you.

187
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,920
Otherwise,

188
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,140
soon,

189
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,700
it won't help his personal good.

190
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,980
Yanyi,

191
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,240
try to remember

192
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,320
what you should be in the future

193
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,520
after your whole life.

194
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,260
Why?

195
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,120
Of course,

196
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,520
Yi Jingzong.

197
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,080
It's not a big deal that I take a bath today.

198
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,300
付罪

199
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,700
Why are you stopping here?

200
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,500
I'm hungry.

201
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,100
I have to eat something before I run away.

202
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Right?

203
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,900
Come down.

204
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,700
What if they chase us?

205
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Don't worry.

206
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,300
Those guys can't catch up.

207
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,500
Besides, they have to follow us to this road.

208
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,300
The further they chase, the farther they get.

209
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,300
Who would have thought that we would hide here and drink and eat meat?

210
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,500
What if they are hungry and want to eat something?

211
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,100
What would we do?

212
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,900
No, no, no.

213
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,700
Don't talk nonsense.

214
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,900
Hurry up and help me. Don't waste my food.

215
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,300
300 yuan.

216
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,700
300 yuan.

217
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,500
Look at the price.

218
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,300
700 yuan.

219
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,100
Let's go inside.

220
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,500
Let's go.

221
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,500
This small restaurant is quite good.

222
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,300
It will be boring to the core when we come back later.

223
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,100
Here, drink some milk tea to warm you up.

224
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,500
Thank you.

225
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,500
Brother Tang, you can speak Mongolian?

226
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,100
Of course.

227
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,700
I not only know Mongolian, but also Chinese.

228
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,500
This is I love you.

229
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,700
Do you know what this is?

230
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,300
Fat...

231
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,900
Fatty.

232
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,500
Brother Fatty,

233
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,900
why did you suddenly appear here to save us?

234
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,100
You didn't pass by, did you?

235
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,900
That's right.

236
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,500
Why are you so coincidental?

237
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,300
I really happened to pass by.

238
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,900
It's fate, isn't it?

239
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,900
Why did you come here?

240
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Traveling.

241
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,300
I love traveling since I was a kid.

242
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,300
I like to have fun.

243
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,900
I don't go anywhere.

244
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,700
Who are you?

245
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,500
Welcome to Beijing.

246
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,700
Beijing people?

247
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,500
Where are you two from?

248
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,900
You don't want to tell me?

249
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,700
This...

250
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,700
Brother,

251
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,900
I want to see the relics in your bag.

252
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,900
How do you know about the relics?

253
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,300
Didn't you two tell me?

254
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,500
Fatty,

255
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,100
what are you here for?

256
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,700
I drove here to travel the mainland.

257
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,900
Maybe I remembered it wrong.

258
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
Or it was the gang that chased you.

259
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,100
They told me.

260
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,900
I can't remember.

261
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,300
Anyway, someone told me.

262
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
I...

263
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,700
I'll take a look, okay?

264
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,900
This is not something valuable.

265
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
I want to see you.

266
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,300
You can't see it.

267
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,500
Look at me.

268
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Am I a bad person?

269
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
I usually

270
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,100
collect antique relics in Beijing.

271
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,300
I'm not.

272
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,700
We're all good people, right?

273
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,100
Take this out

274
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,900
and let me see it.

275
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Okay?

276
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,500
It's too dangerous now.

277
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,700
Maybe those mercenaries are nearby.

278
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,300
Don't worry.

279
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,700
I'm here.

280
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,900
Don't underestimate me.

281
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,500
I'm good at fighting against those two.

282
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,300
Why did you put it on the ground?

283
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,100
Where is the bullhead?

284
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,700
Let me see.

285
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,700
How do you know it's a bullhead?

286
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,500
I forgot the vegetables.

287
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,100
Where are you sitting?

288
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,300
I'll go out and order some vegetables.

289
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,300
I'll go.

290
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,500
You two kids don't know Mongolian.

291
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,900
You can't use German here.

292
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,500
This fat guy knows we're students from Germany?

293
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,900
Maybe he's the problem.

294
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,300
He's the one who brought the mercenaries here.

295
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,500
That's not true.

296
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,700
This fat guy's style is not like those

297
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
trained mercenaries.

298
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
I think he's a civil servant.

299
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,100
I don't know where he got the news of the bullhead.

300
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,500
He also thinks of this bullhead.

301
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,300
Let's be careful.

302
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,100
Don't worry.

303
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,700
Look at the米.

304
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,300
emphasize,

305
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,240
whether on an emergency

306
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,260
situation was?

307
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,380
No,

308
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,500
no Pru gözüreciğis

309
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,740
on the left has arrived

310
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,000
the old

311
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,620
friend of me

312
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,920
how is

313
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,780
this

314
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,200
chopsticks

315
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,940
He's not a man of the word.

316
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,540
At least 9 points.

317
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,340
At least 10 points.

318
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,660
An Ning, we've been training here for three years.

319
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,860
Boss is on his way to Boyuan.

320
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,740
We've sent out the man.

321
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,100
We still haven't found them.

322
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,860
It looks like he's Yong Bin's leader.

323
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,860
Stop looking.

324
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,780
Are you going to fight or run?

325
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,780
Give me a call.

326
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,580
Do me a favor.

327
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,780
You bunch of trash.

328
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,860
So many people can chase two students and still lose them?

329
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,860
What?

330
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
They have one more assistant.

331
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
There are only three of them.

332
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
How can you tell me if you lose them?

333
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
Stop them.

334
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
I'm not going with you.

335
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
Boss.

336
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
I'm not going with you.

337
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
They'll be after me!

338
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Sure.

339
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Boss responsibilities.

340
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,700
초 conhe很高分

341
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Wanna understand or teach me?

342
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,500
See this?

343
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,200
We have no choice.

344
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,980
What are you doing here?

345
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,980
I'll think of a way to control that woman first.

346
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,980
What's wrong?

347
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980
Go!

348
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,980
You go behind me first.

349
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,980
Fatty.

350
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,980
Go, go, go.

351
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,980
Hurry up.

352
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,980
What's going on?

353
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,980
Wait.

354
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,980
You guys are hitting me.

355
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,980
It's not appropriate.

356
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,980
What kind of mercenary are you?

357
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Are you ashamed?

358
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
I'm training for you guys.

359
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
You wait.

360
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,980
You're too short.

361
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,980
Don't eat.

362
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,980
You're too thin.

363
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,980
Who do you think I'll kill you?

364
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,980
Don't move.

365
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,980
Your hair is too thin.

366
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,980
You don't eat either.

367
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,980
Then it's that woman.

368
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
Fatty.

369
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
Fatty.

370
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
Fatty.

371
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,980
Coming.

372
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
I got it.

373
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Fatty, hurry up.

374
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,980
Hurry up, Fatty.

375
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
Sit behind me.

376
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,980
Hurry up.

377
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,980
I'm going to kill you.

378
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
I'm going to kill you.

379
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
I'm going to kill you.

380
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
I'm going to kill you.

381
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
I'm going to kill you.

382
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
I'm going to kill you.

383
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,980
I'm going to kill you.

384
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,980
There you go.

385
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,380
It was a friend of mine who did theсятine.

386
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,820
A friend?

387
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,180
Exactly, definitely a friend!

388
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:35,560
It was� a desert treasurehead who'd men Talisman On Oczywiście if he were able to transform a piece of her into something smaller.

389
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,680
Scorm modular routing...

390
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:49,080
All the human

391
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,700
Her Finishes

392
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Hey, can you hear what sound is that?

393
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Where did that sound come from? Did you see a ghost?

394
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,700
It's true. It seems to be the wind chimes.

395
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,200
Where did the wind chimes come from in the wild?

396
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,700
You got hit too hard, so you changed your ears?

397
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Let's go.

398
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
Boss.

399
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,700
Yes.

400
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Liu Cai and I are heading to the mountain to stop them.

401
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Yes.

402
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Wu Generaries

403
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
What's going on?

404
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,700
Based on me and wilde then,

405
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
there should be no more fuel,

406
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,700
but I feel...

407
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
and I feel...

408
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,320
Do you still want the

409
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,460
wearing?

410
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,100
Don't know!

411
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,280
Is this surgery done?

412
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,880
This is not surgery!

413
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,780
Big Sister has done well!

414
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,780
Is there anyone?

415
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
Monk.

416
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
Stop looking.

417
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,220
Such a big place.

418
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,220
Only three of us are alive.

419
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,220
The people in this temple must have something to do.

420
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,220
Look at these offerings.

421
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,220
They must have been prepared for the passers-by.

422
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
There is the back door.

423
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Let's go over there.

424
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Go.

425
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,780
My goodness.

426
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,780
How could this be?

427
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,780
I'm full.

428
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,780
Why do I have to carry it?

429
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,780
Why are you standing here?

430
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,780
What's the use of opening a door here?

431
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,780
Fatty, what is this?

432
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,780
This...

433
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,780
Water.

434
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,780
Water.

435
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,780
According to their current speed,

436
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,780
it won't take long for them to reach the door.

437
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,780
What's the name of the woman at the top?

438
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,780
I heard that her subordinate called her An Ning.

439
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,780
That kick was really harsh.

440
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,780
I will kick it back sooner or later.

441
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,780
There are so many of them.

442
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,780
If they surround us, we will be dead.

443
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,780
Are we really going to die like this?

444
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,780
No way.

445
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,780
I haven't touched the girl's hand yet.

446
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,780
Fatty, why is your car so broken?

447
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,780
I have a way.

448
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,780
What way?

449
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,780
Blast the car.

450
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,780
Blast the car?

451
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,780
Blast the car?

452
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,780
If we blast the car, we can't run away.

453
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,780
You think I want to blast it?

454
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,780
My car is very expensive.

455
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,780
Now the key is not the blast of the car.

456
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,780
If the car is blasted,

457
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,780
we can still run away and get out of the mess.

458
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,780
But if we can't run away,

459
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,780
how can we make such a big noise

460
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,780
and the police will come to help?

461
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,780
Stop thinking. Hurry up and help.

462
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,780
Han Shang, help.

463
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,780
These are all art.

464
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,780
Come on, hurry up.

465
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,780
Hurry up.

466
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,780
Hurry up.

467
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,780
Hurry up.

468
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,780
It's too late.

469
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,780
Hurry up.

470
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,780
Hurry up.

471
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,780
Hurry.

472
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,780
We are dead.

473
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,780
sets the alarm.

474
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,780
Our car Landesregierung

475
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,780
must perform a brunt.

476
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,780
Get down!

477
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,780
Get down!

478
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,780
No, no, no!

479
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,780
It's over, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, over!

480
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
What do you mean, over, over, over, over?

481
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,780
You dumbass!

482
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,780
Why are you so angry?

483
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,780
I'm fine.

484
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,780
Big brother.

485
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,780
I...

486
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,780
I'll blow you up!

487
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,780
You're so lucky!

488
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,780
Let's run away!

489
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,780
Listen to me, people in the temple!

490
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,780
If you want to live, hand over the thing!

491
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,780
Damn!

492
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,780
Little brother, they're too many.

493
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:16,780
If you can't do it, you can sell them.

494
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
Impossible.

495
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
But they have guns.

496
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,780
We can't fight them.

497
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
That's right.

498
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,780
That's right.

499
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,780
No.

500
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,780
I will never give them the cow head.

501
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,780
Then what should we do?

502
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,780
Wu Xie, Wu Xie, you...

503
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,780
Wu Xie, what are you doing?

504
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
We want to negotiate.

505
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,780
You have no right to negotiate.

506
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,780
Leave the thing.

507
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,780
Maybe I can spare your lives.

508
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,780
Listen.

509
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,780
You want the cow head, right?

510
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,780
There's a cliff right next to it.

511
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,780
If you come, I'll throw it away.

512
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,780
Little brother, don't throw it away.

513
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,780
Just laugh at them.

514
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,780
Wu Xie, don't be impulsive.

515
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,780
Impulsiveness is a devil.

516
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,780
Don't care about him.

517
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
Ignore him.

518
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,780
Don't come.

519
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,780
Or I'll throw it away.

520
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,780
Not bad.

521
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,780
Shit.

522
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,780
Are you crazy?

523
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,780
You really threw it away?

524
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,780
Why don't you care about us?

525
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,780
We'll die if we don't have the cow head.

526
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,780
Don't move.

527
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,780
I won't come out.

528
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,780
If you want the cow head, jump down and fight.

529
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,780
Hurry up.

530
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,780
I won't come out.

531
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,780
If you want to go, you have to hit me.

532
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,780
If you don't come out, I'll shoot.

533
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,780
Don't use the stone.

534
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,780
Don't hit me.

535
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,780
Don't.

536
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,780
The putting out video of Lu Boss-k护

537
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,780
ask to be at our problems again.

538
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,780
What else can I find then?

539
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,780
If you are going down again,

540
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,780
I've observed it everywhere

541
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,780
There is one bet.

542
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,780
Don't let it go anymore.

543
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,780
Stop.

544
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,680
Shoot him.

545
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,860
Don't shoot him.

546
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,920
Jail.

547
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,460
At least we can't kill him.

548
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:07,760
Even if we can,

549
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,560
I'll let you go.

550
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,500
Do you remember how,

551
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,820
you eventual wife was there?

552
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,700
You two?!

553
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:18,980

Wu Xie, what's going on?

I think something is wrong.

00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,980
Get out!

569
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
Get out!

570
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
Get out!

571
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,980
Get out!

572
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,980
Get out!

573
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,980
Get out!

574
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,980
Get out!

575
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,980
Get out!

576
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,980
Get out!

577
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,980
Get out!

578
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,980
Get out!

579
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,980
Get out!

580
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,980
Get out of my way!

581
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Get out!

582
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,980
Get out!

583
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
Get out!

584
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,980
Get out!

585
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,980
Get out!

586
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,980
Yes!

587
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,980
Damn it!

588
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,980
I can't get out of the car.

589
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,180
It's the cliff over there.

590
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,180
Yes, the cliff over there. This way.

591
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,180
Rocks and scissors.

592
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,180
This way.

593
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,380
I thought you were talking nonsense over there, Fatty.

594
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,380
You two, wait for me.

595
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,380
Slow down.

596
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,980
The General's car is here. Hurry.

597
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,980
Hurry.

598
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,980
Don't rush.

599
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,980
Hurry.

600
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,980
Hurry.

601
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,980
Hurry.

602
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,980
Hurry.

603
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
Hurry.

604
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,980
Hurry.

605
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,980
Hurry.

606
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,980
Hurry.

607
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,980
Hurry.

608
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,980
Hurry.

609
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
Hurry.

610
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,980
Hurry.

611
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,980
The General is here.

612
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,980
General.

613
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,980
What's going on?

614
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,980
A cow head from the Qing Dynasty suddenly appeared in the office.

615
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,980
Who sent it?

616
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,980
General, we don't know who sent the cow head.

617
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,980
All places have been searched.

618
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,980
We can't see the shadow. We're still checking the surveillance.

619
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,980
Continue searching.

620
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,980
General, we found it here as soon as we entered.

621
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,980
General, you're so brave.

622
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,980
You didn't know who sent it?

623
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,980
That's right.

624
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,980
It's me.

625
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,980
General, we're here.

626
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,980
General, we're here.

627
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,980
General, we're here.

628
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,980
General, we're here.

629
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,980
General.

630
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,980
General, we're here.

631
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,980
General.

632
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,980
General.

633
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,980
General.

634
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,980
General.

635
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,980
It's a bit strange.

636
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980
What is this?

637
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,980
It seems like there is some information on this.

638
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,980
Let's go. I'm so tired. Let's go home first.

639
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,980
Why are you so not curious?

640
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,940
The

641
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,940
The

642
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,940
The

643
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,940
The

644
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,940
Are you done?

645
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,940
Why are you taking so long?

646
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,940
I'm done. I'm done.

647
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,940
Do you think this is a bit strange?

648
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,940
What's wrong?

649
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,900
It's been three days since we donated the bullhead to the cultural and business management agency.

650
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,900
But why is there no news report?

651
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,900
You want to be famous?

652
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,900
If I wanted to be famous, I would have already donated it.

653
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,900
But such a big thing, there is not even a single thing.

654
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,900
Don't you think it's strange?

655
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,900
This means that this bullhead has nothing special.

656
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,900
What? There is nothing special?

657
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,900
And we have to send it back?

658
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,860
No.

659
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,860
What I mean is that although it is a cultural relic,

660
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,860
but from the quality, the completeness of preservation,

661
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,860
and the archaeological value,

662
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,860
there is nothing special.

663
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,860
Since there is nothing special,

664
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,860
why did those mercenaries bite and release us for it

665
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,860
and chase us all the way?

666
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,860
If it's really like what you said,

667
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,860
there is no special value.

668
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,860
Why is that beautiful female leader so nervous

669
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,860
and following us all the way?

670
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,860
That's right.

671
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,860
Why are they?

672
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,820
Could it be the Uncle Bo?

673
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,820
If the target of these mercenaries is Uncle Bo,

674
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,820
there must be some important information on it.

675
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,820
Will this thing be more valuable than the bullhead?

676
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,820
Looking at them in a fierce manner,

677
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,820
I think it's possible.

678
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,820
Then,

679
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,820
should we go to the temple again?

680
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,820
Yes.

681
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,820
But I don't think we should go.

682
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,780
Then,

683
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,780
should we go to the Cultural and Martial Arts Protection Administration again?

684
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,780
Don't be anxious.

685
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,780
We haven't figured out what it is yet.

686
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,780
We'll see.

687
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,780
Isn't your family doing ancient and secret business?

688
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,780
Can you find out something?

689
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,780
I'll try.

690
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,780
This Uncle Bo looks a bit old.

691
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,780
From this side,

692
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,780
there are obvious cracks and cuts.

693
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,780
What are you doing?

694
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,780
I'm asking someone to consult with me.

695
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,780
You continue.

696
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,780
There are obvious cracks and cuts.

697
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,780
What does this mean?

698
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,780
Look at this side.

699
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,780
The other three sides are very complete.

700
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,740
I suspect this is only part of Uncle Bo's book.

701
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,740
There may be another chapter.

702
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,740
There's another chapter?

703
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,740
What does it say?

704
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,740
I say, brother,

705
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,740
you have to give me some time to study it.

706
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,740
No.

707
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,740
Wu Xie.

708
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,740
You've been staring at that shabby cloth for three days.

709
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,740
Give up.

710
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,740
I'm not interested.

711
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,740
Why are you so not interested?

712
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,740
Why am I not interested?

713
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,740
I've posted the problem on the internet.

714
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,740
You posted the information about Uncle Bo on the internet?

715
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,740
Yes.

716
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,740
More people came up with ideas.

717
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,740
Internet thinking.

718
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,740
Hello?

719
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,740
What?

720
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,740
You want me to pay?

721
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,740
You're here.

722
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,740
Old Li, who told you to pay?

723
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,740
Your girlfriend.

724
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,740
You're not interesting enough.

725
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,740
You didn't tell us even if you found a girlfriend.

726
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,740
My girlfriend?

727
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,740
Yes.

728
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,740
I've never seen you bring a girl to eat.

729
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,740
This is the first time you've brought such a beautiful girl.

730
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,740
Tell me the truth.

731
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,740
Where do you know her?

732
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,740
Where is she from?

733
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,740
Wait a minute.

734
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,740
You mean my girlfriend asked me to pay for the meal she ate here?

735
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,740
Yes.

736
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,740
Where is she?

737
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,740
There. Look.

738
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,740
Hello.

739
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,740
Hello.

740
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,740
Hello.

741
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,740
Hello.

742
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,740
Excuse me.

743
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,740

Who cares?

00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,740

Then what did he say?

804
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,740
