37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is a weapon for yireng

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,760
A heart was produced

39
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:23,400
by mere

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,040
Such poison

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Is it the same as you imagined?

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
Fatty, wait.

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Brother, can you see from these mosquitoes?

44
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Who is buried here?

45
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
There's an entrance!

46
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
There's an entrance in the tomb.

47
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Don't be so angry.

48
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Don't be so scary.

49
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
I'm sorry. I was a little excited.

50
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Brother, walk slowly.

51
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
I'm dizzy.

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
I'm not your teacher.

53
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Come down if you can.

54
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Okay, I won't talk.

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Walk steadily.

56
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
Sanye, there's something.

57
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,040
The hands are shaking.

58
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Okay, step slowly.

59
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Don't rush.

60
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Stop moving.

61
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
I won't go easy on you.

62
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Go to her abode.

63
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,040
I'll stop fighting if I can beat her.

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Let's go.

65
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,040
Great god!

66
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,680
Yes.

67
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,760
What are you doing?

68
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,800
I'm trying to see if there's any mechanism.

69
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,600
Master San, I'll go inside and have a look.

70
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,120
This top is used to put the memorial items.

71
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,320
You want to be a memorial item?

72
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,560
Master San, don't scare me.

73
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,320
I'm scared.

74
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,040
This is really a good item.

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,680
Don't move.

76
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,600

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,240
The mahjong is over 2.

80
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,640
The prize-winning queen.

81
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,320
The treasure hunt in the Golden City.

82
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,280
The recruitment of the colorful cat.

83
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,920
The prize-winning captain.

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,360
The super high pay rate.

85
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,400
The reward rate is high.

86
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,160
There are many opportunities to take revenge.

87
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,560
Hurry up and join.

Aomenshin Peking Entertainment City 772772.com.

89
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,120
What's going on?

90
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,920
Is he talking to her?

91
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,400
Hurry up.

92
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,200
Hurry.

93
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,920
Tianhe must leave here before.

94
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,360
Don't touch anything here.

95
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,720
Go past it gently.

96
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Never break it.

97
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Let's go

98
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
let's go

99
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,620
Haisheng, where are you?

100
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,620
I'm here, what's wrong?

101
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Still ask

102
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,720
I'm here. I'm afraid I say something and you blame me

103
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,720
You don't have to be so polite to her

104
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,720
WuXian, where are you?

105
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm in the passage.

106
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,720
The decoration here is getting old.

107
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,120
It should be the main chamber.

108
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,920
Okay.

109
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
This hole was dug not long ago.

110
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,720
The soil is very hard.

111
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,120
It should be dug by those who dug the tomb.

112
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,120
It looks like they dug this hole very fast.

113
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,120
But this hole doesn't look like it was hit from the outside.

114
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,720
It looks like it was hit from the inside.

115
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Could it be that they took the relics and left?

116
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Not necessarily.

117
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
They didn't leave the source stream.

118
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
It looks like they left the country.

119
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
We should hurry up.

120
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Since someone has dug the tomb,

121
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
we should not waste time.

122
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
We should hurry up.

123
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Since someone has dug the tomb,

124
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
we should not waste time.

125
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Since someone has dug the tomb,

126
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
we should not waste time.

127
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,720
Since someone has dug the tomb,

128
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
we should not waste time.

129
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Since someone has dug the tomb,

130
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
we should not waste time.

131
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Since someone has dug the tomb,

132
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
we should not waste time.

133
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Since someone has dug the tomb,

134
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
we should not waste time.

135
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Since someone has dug the tomb,

136
00:10:41,720 --> 00:11:02,920
and you are close to the

137
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,320
sources of drug

138
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,680
that release high Street

139
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,560
This is the door that was locked.

140
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,760
From the hole we saw earlier,

141
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,760
this door should have been opened from the inside.

142
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Let's go inside and take a look.

143
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,040
Everyone, be careful.

144
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,640
Hurry up.

145
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
The light in this tomb hasn't changed.

146
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,720
It's still the same.

147
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
It's the same.

148
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
It's the same.

149
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
It's the same.

150
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
It's the same.

151
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
It's the same.

152
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
It's the same.

153
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
It's the same.

154
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,720
It's the same.

155
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
It's the same.

156
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
It's the same.

157
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
It's the same.

158
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
It's the same.

159
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
The light in this tomb hasn't changed.

160
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
There might be someone else.

161
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Why are there so many temples here?

162
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Did you learn ancient literature?

163
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Take a look at what it says.

164
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Let me see.

165
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Wu Qian, you stay still for a little bit.

166
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
I'll scan the flyers.

167
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,720
I think it's the body of the master of this stone coffin.

168
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Who is it?

169
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,720
It seems to be a pig monkey from Lu State.

170
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,720
No matter what, we finally know who's the next one.

171
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,720
But there are so many coffins. Which one is his?

172
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
There are seven coffins here.

173
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,720
They are arranged according to the location of the seven stars of Beidou.

174
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
Let's look at the names and details of the coffins separately.

175
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
See what we can find.

176
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,720
These names and details seem to be similar.

177
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
Master San.

178
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
It's a gun.

179
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
It's a gun.

180
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
It's a gun.

181
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
It's a gun.

182
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
It's a gun.

183
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
It's a gun.

184
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
It's a gun.

185
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
It seems to be left by those foreigners. Take it.

186
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
This coffin is open.

187
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
There are traces of iron bars on the coffin.

188
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
And the key is new.

189
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
Pan Zi.

190
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Why is this a foreigner?

191
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Don't move.

192
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
The master is downstairs.

193
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
This is the body of the master.

194
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,720
This is the body of the master.

195
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,060
I am really happy

196
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,300
When would it be me?

197
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,580
When you get stir-fried

198
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,160
and I eat it

199
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:52,340
I'll

200
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,220
let it go

201
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Wu Xie, Third Uncle, Little Brother, Pan Zi.

202
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Then who is this shadow?

203
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Over there!

204
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
I don't care if you are a person or a ghost!

205
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,720
This is bad. We can't let him go to the tomb.

206
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
If he meets that coffin, it's over!

207
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Pan Zi, don't chase him!

208
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Wu Xie, how are you?

209
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Where did that person go?

210
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
We're fine.

211
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
I'm going to the tomb.

212
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
I'm going to the tomb.

213
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Wu Xie, how are you?

214
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Where did that person go?

215
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
We're fine.

216
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
That person ran to the tomb we just came from.

217
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
Meng You Ping went to chase him.

218
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
That person must be from the tomb group.

219
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
When we catch him,

220
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,720
we have to make him spit out everything he knows.

221
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
That's not necessarily the case.

222
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,720
They like group action.

223
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Just now, it was just one person.

224
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
I guess he's just here to make a fool of himself.

225
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
There are two second sisters here.

226
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
Let's go and check this first.

227
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Be careful.

228
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Wu Xie,

229
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
you're here.

230
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
I'm here.

231
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
I'm here.

232
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
I'm here.

233
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
I'm here.

234
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
I'm here.

235
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
I'm here.

236
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
I'm here.

237
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
I'm here.

238
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
I'm here.

239
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
I'm here.

240
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I'm here.

241
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
I'm here.

242
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
I'm here.

243
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
I'm here.

244
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm here.

245
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
I'm here.

246
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
I'm here.

247
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
I'm here.

248
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
I'm here.

249
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
I'm here.

250
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
I'm here.

251
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
I'm here.

252
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
I'm here.

253
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
I'm here.

254
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
I'm here.

255
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
I'm here.

256
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
I'm here.

257
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
I'm here.

258
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
I'm here.

259
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
I'm here.

260
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
I'm here.

261
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
I'm here.

262
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
I'm here.

263
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
I'm here.

264
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
I'm here.

265
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
I'm here.

266
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
I'm here.

267
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
I'm here.

268
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
I'm here.

269
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
I'm here.

270
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
I'm here.

271
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
I'm here.

272
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
I'm here.

273
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
I'm here.

274
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
I'm here.

275
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
I'm here.

276
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
I'm here.

277
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
I'm here.

278
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
I'm here.

279
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I'm here.

280
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
I'm here.

281
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
I'm here.

282
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
I'm here.

283
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
I'm here.

284
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
I'm here.

285
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
I'm here.

286
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
I'm here.

287
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
I'm here.

288
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
I'm here.

289
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm here.

290
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
I'm here.

291
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
I'm here.

292
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
I'm here.

293
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
I'm here.

294
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
I'm here.

295
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
I'm here.

296
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
I'm here.

297
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
I'm here.

298
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
I'm here.

299
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
I'm here.

300
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
I'm here.

301
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
I'm here.

302
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
I'm here.

303
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
I'm here.

304
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
I'm here.

305
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
I'm here.

306
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
I'm here.

307
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
I'm here.

308
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
I'm here.

309
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
I'm here.

310
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
I'm here.

311
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
I'm here.

312
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
I'm here.

313
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
I'm here.

314
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Seven Stars.

315
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
I think I've seen it in grandpa's notebook.

316
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Uncle San.

317
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Uncle San.

318
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Uncle San.

319
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Uncle San.

320
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Pan Zi.

321
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Uncle San.

322
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Pan Zi.

323
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Uncle San.

324
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Wu Xie, what happened over there?

325
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Uncle San.

326
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Pan Zi.

327
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Uncle San.

328
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Han Shou, can you hear me?

329
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
I can hear you.

330
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
What happened?

331
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
I don't know.

332
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Uncle San and Pan Zi suddenly disappeared.

333
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Disappeared?

334
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
How could they disappear suddenly?

335
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
I don't know.

336
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,720
But they won't leave me alone, right?

337
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Besides,

338
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
there was no fighting sound just now.

339
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
They just evaporated.

340
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Don't worry.

341
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Take your time.

342
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
How can I not worry?

343
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
There are seven coffins here.

344
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
And a strange body.

345
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
A body?

346
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Uncle San.

347
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Pan Zi.

348
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
San...

349
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Wu Xie!

350
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Wu Xie.

351
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
走!

352
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Han Shou.

353
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
Han Shou.

354
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
What's going on?

355
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Let me do it

356
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Wu Xie, Wu Xie, can you hear me?

357
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Speak, speak

358
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
What did you say?

359
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
I just said whatever I wanted to hear

360
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
I'm alone in the tomb now

361
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
I'm scared

362
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Don't be scared, we're here

363
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
That was the Seven Stars Pass

364
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
I saw it in grandpa's notebook

365
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,720
The Seven Stars Pass means there are seven coffins in the tomb

366
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Only one of them is real

367
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,720
The rest are all organs

368
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
If you open one wrong, you're dead

369
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
So you mean that foreigner got a organ?

370
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
I think so

371
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,720
They thought all the coffins had treasures

372
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
But they were dragged into the coffin

373
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
There's a hole

374
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Maybe I can get out

375
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Hansheng, can you hear me?

376
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Yes

377
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
There's a gap here

378
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
I can't see clearly

379
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
You told me to listen

380
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Forget it, I'll just use my personality

381
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Wait

382
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Did you forget that I told you not to touch anything?

383
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,720
You'd better be careful

384
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
I'll put a mark here

385
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Then they can find me

386
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
I'll go this way

387
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,720
There's a hole

388
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
I'll go this way

389
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
Do you think this place is familiar?

390
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Isn't this the tomb I just entered?

391
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Why am I back?

392
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
I'm back

393
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Do you think it's easy for me?

394
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,720
The first time I entered the tomb

395
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I met a seed everywhere

396
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
I couldn't even breathe

397
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,720
I just want to find the relic now

398
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Let them find me

399
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Take the relic home

400
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Wu Xie, don't be angry

401
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
I know

402
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Maybe there's a clue on the map

403
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
I'll go this way

404
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
Don't move

405
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
Let me see what's written on it

406
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
What's written on it?

407
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
It's all ghost paintings

408
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
There's a map here

409
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
A map?

410
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Isn't this the map of the tomb?

411
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
This is the tomb

412
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
This is the Seven Stars Monastery

413
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Then the next to it should be

414
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
There's no tomb I just came down from

415
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
They probably haven't been there

416
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
This is the cave I just climbed

417
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
This is the crossroads

418
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Wu Xie, look at the other crossroads

419
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
What's written on it?

420
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
It

421
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Look

422
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
This is where I'm standing now

423
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
But this picture clearly shows

424
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
There's another tomb next to it

425
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Yes, it's a line between the tombs

426
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
So

427
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Next to this wall

428
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
There's a secret passage

429
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
I've studied the structure of the stone door

430
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,720
The mechanisms that touch the secret passage

431
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Are usually flat

432
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
If there's really a secret passage

433
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
There must be a stone in here

434
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
That can move

435
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
I'll go check it out

436
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
Okay

437
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,720
I'll go check it out

438
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
Okay

439
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
I'll go check it out

440
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
Okay

441
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
I'll go check it out

442
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Okay

443
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
I'll go check it out

444
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Okay

445
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
I'll go check it out

446
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Okay

447
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
I'll go check it out

448
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
Okay

449
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
I'll go check it out

450
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Okay

451
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
I'll go check it out

452
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
Okay

453
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Wu Xie

454
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
Wu Xie!

455
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Wu Xie, how are you?

456
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
You're not even dead yet.

457
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,300
You're so broken that you're already broken.

458
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,300
Don't be anxious.

459
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,300
I can't do anything without a signal.

460
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
You don't want to leave, do you?

461
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,020
Just now, there was no news of the threat of the mechanism.

462
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,020
It could be that it already appeared.

463
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,020
Do you know that?

464
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,220
Third Uncle didn't allow you to leave.

465
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,220
Third Uncle indeed didn't allow me to leave.

466
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
But he didn't forbid you to leave.

467
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,160
Teacher He Microsoft

468
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
www.ymlic.com

469
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
What do you mean by these numbers?

470
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:51,520
You know these look

471
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,120
It's me, Panties.

472
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,120
What are you still standing there for? Come up here.

473
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,120
I thought you were going to kill me.

474
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,120
I really didn't have time to explain.

475
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,220
Little Master San, are you okay?

476
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,120
I'm fine. Let's just go.

477
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,520
If they come up here, we're done for.

478
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,520
The tunnel must be left by those woodcutters to escape.

479
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
As long as we follow this path, we can get out.

480
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,920
Wait! I've walked a few times.

481
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,120
There's no exit. It's a maze.

482
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Then we can't stay here.

483
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,520
What the hell is this door?

484
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,920
How can it open from the top?

485
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,920
Let me down.

486
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
Don't move!

487
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
It's you again.

488
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Wu Xie?

489
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,720
The guy next to you, let the duckling hang the gun.

490
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,920
I, Wang Panties.

491
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Wang Panties.

492
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,120
You guys fell from here too?

493
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,120
Little Master San, you know each other?

494
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,120
The monster that was scaring us when we were watching just now, was you?

495
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,320
Where did so many monsters come from?

496
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,520
We haven't seen each other for so long.

497
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,720
Wu Xie, why are you still so naive?

498
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Oh, right. What's wrong with your friend?

499
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,120
The guy just came to say hello.

500
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,320
You just shot him? You're so cruel.

501
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,320
Who told you to pretend to be a ghost?

502
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,720
You guys overreacted.

503
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,920
Be careful! There's a corpse!

504
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,320
Save the fire!

505
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,920
Fire? Who has fire? Save the fire!

506
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,320
Save the fire!

507
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,720
Get lost!

508
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,320
The fire is almost gone! Do you have more?

509
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,520
Fire!

510
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,320
Coming! Coming!

511
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,520
Help him out! Fire!

512
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Just die.

513
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,320
I'm coming!

514
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,920
Wu Xie, you're blind? You're still my friend?

515
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,120
I've been a guard for my whole life.

516
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,120
I didn't think I'd be with two old men.

517
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,520
Am I wrong?

518
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,720
Fatty, it's time. Why are you still here?

519
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Give it to me!

520
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,920
Protect Little Third Master! Go!

521
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,720
Fatty!

522
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,520
Go!

523
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,120
Fatty!

524
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,120
Fatty!

525
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,320
Fatty!

526
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,120
Fatty!

527
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,920
Brother Xiu, save him!

528
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,720
He's here.

529
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,520
Who?

530
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,520
Don't ask! Run!

531
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,120
Wu Xie!

532
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,120
Please reply!

533
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,320
If there's no signal, we'll go down and find him.

534
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,520
Enough. He can't catch up.

535
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,320
Huh?

536
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,920
Take a break. Take a break.

537
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,320
Slowly. Slowly.

538
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,920
Be careful.

539
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,320
Who's that?

540
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,120
A soldier.

541
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,720
Fatty, help me take care of him.

542
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Why are you staring?

543
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,920
Fatty, you're not going to die.

544
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,720
I'm going to save him.

545
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,520
I'm going to save him.

546
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
I'm going to save him.

547
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
I'm going to save him.

548
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,520
I'm going to save him.

549
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
I'm going to save him.

550
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
I'm going to save him.

551
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
I'm going to save him.

552
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
I'm going to save him.

553
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
I'm going to save him.

554
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
I'm going to save him.

555
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
I'm going to save him.

556
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
I'm going to save him.

557
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
I'm going to save him.

558
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
I'm going to save him.

559
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
I'm going to save him.

560
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
I'm going to save him.

561
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
I'm going to save him.

562
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
I'm going to save him.

563
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
I'm going to save him.

564
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
I'm going to save him.

565
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
I'm going to save him.

566
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
I'm going to save him.
