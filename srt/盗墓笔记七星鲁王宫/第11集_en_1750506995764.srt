The End

74
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I think this little brother

75
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
is a real person.

76
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll tell you the truth.

77
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
In the Qingtong Guwan Realm,

78
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm also famous.

79
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If it weren't for the money,

80
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I wouldn't have bought this baby.

81
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You are mixed in the Guwan Realm.

82
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We will meet often in the future.

83
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Please take good care of me.

84
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No, no.

85
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Learn from each other.

86
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Learn from each other.

87
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes, yes, yes.

88
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's it.

89
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
OK.

90
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Please wait.

91
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Take care.

92
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
OK, OK, OK.

93
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't believe it.

94
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You are fooling me.

95
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I spent 300,000 to buy it.

96
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you hit me,

97
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
you have to pay me.

98
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Fatty, you have a lot of money today.

99
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Do you know what this is?

100
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Isn't this a broken cup?

101
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What broken cup?

102
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I tell you.

103
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This thing is called a foot.

104
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's a name of a wine in the Shang Dynasty.

105
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The market value is one million.

106
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Really?

107
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
One million.

108
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you don't believe it,

109
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
ask an expert.

110
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm going to ask an expert.

111
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm going to ask an expert.

112
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's go eat roast duck.

113
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's go eat roast duck.

114
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
When did you come to Beijing?

115
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why don't you say hello in advance?

116
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll pick you up.

117
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are so ungrateful.

118
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You came by yourself.

119
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Fatty, long time no see.

120
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Long time no see.

121
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is Chen Chengcheng.

122
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He went to the Lujuan Palace with us before.

123
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But he didn't scare us.

124
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This one, this one, this one.

125
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This one, this one, this one.

126
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This one, this one, this one.

127
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This one, this one, this one.

128
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This one, this one, this one.

129
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This one, this one, this one.

130
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This one, this one, this one.

131
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
When you fainted,

132
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you gave me a picture in the village.

133
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I was a little impatient.

134
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I didn't have time to say hello.

135
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hello, Fatty.

136
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Just call me Fatty.

137
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hello, Chen Chen.

138
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Chen Chengcheng.

139
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Chengcheng.

140
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
By the way,

141
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I actually came here this time.

142
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's something I want you to help me with.

143
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What is it?

144
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I want to see the old lady of the Huo family.

145
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You mean the third lady of the Huo family

146
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
who is known as the old lady of the Huo family?

147
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That kind.

148
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wu Xie,

149
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
you're too naive.

150
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't say it's you.

151
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Even if it's the son of the old lady,

152
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
you have to see him in a good mood.

153
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why are you like Third Uncle?

154
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You can't say no

155
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
even if you haven't tried it yet.

156
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I didn't say no.

157
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You talk to the Beijing people about rules.

158
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
As for you,

159
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
as for me,

160
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
when do you think I'll follow the rules?

161
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But you tell me first.

162
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Why are you looking for him?

163
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
When he's online,

164
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll tell you.

165
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Delicious.

166
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you, Fatty.

167
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Thank you, Fatty.

168
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Eat more.

169
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't tell Fatty about it.

170
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't worry.

171
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's okay to have him.

172
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Wu Xie,

173
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I

174
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
hired an expert

175
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
to help me verify it.

176
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Guess what?

177
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's exactly like what you said.

178
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I can't see

179
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
how you're so good

180
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
at this antique verification.

181
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Fatty, I'm making a big fortune this time.

182
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Eat whatever you want.

183
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's just luck.

184
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Come on, let's eat.

185
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The most exciting PG game

Cheers.

189
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Cheers.

190
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:33,180
No wonder the

191
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,180
I'm not going to open for three years.

192
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,180
Open for three years.

193
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,180
Yeah.

194
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,180
Fatty made so much money this time.

195
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,180
I guess he can rest at home for three years.

196
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,180
By the way,

197
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,180
how's your help?

198
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,180
Don't worry.

199
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,180
It's done.

200
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,180
So fast.

201
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,180
Of course.

202
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,180
You're not going to be late.

203
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,180
Beijing 49 City.

204
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,180
I'm the number one in the world.

205
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Right?

206
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,180
But I

207
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,180
have to hear your reason first

208
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,180
before I decide whether to do it or not.

209
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,180
Do you remember the gold and silk

210
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,180
we took out from the tomb of King Lushan?

211
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,180
Of course.

212
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,180
Did you donate it or not?

213
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,180
That's fake.

214
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,180
It was transferred by Brother Jia.

215
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,180
What?

216
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,180
Uncle San has already checked it.

217
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,180
The purity is too high.

218
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,180
The craftsmanship when it was taken

219
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,180
is not good.

220
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,180
It's not good at all.

221
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,180
Damn it.

222
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
The girl's

223
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,180
back is a shadow.

224
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Don't let Fatty Wang

225
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,180
take her.

226
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,180
If he takes her, he has to spend her.

227
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,180
But I also found

228
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,180
another thing.

229
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,180
Only Old Huo

230
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,180
knows the origin of this thing.

231
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,180
No wonder.

232
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,180
I said, why are you looking for her?

233
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,180
Ning.

234
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,180
Huo is going to a auction.

235
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,180
How about this?

236
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
Let's get in there

237
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
and have a draw.

238
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,180
We can ask her face to face.

239
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,180
She won't be kicked out.

240
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,180
That depends on

241
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,180
your ability to fool the young master.

242
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,180
I'm going.

243
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,180
It's been a long time

244
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,180
since I saw Mr. Zhang.

245
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
I'm going to call him.

246
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,180
Mr. Zhang, you're here.

247
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,180
Hello.

248
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,180
Long time no see.

249
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,180
Brother.

250
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,180
Let's go.

251
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180
Please come in.

252
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,180
Hey, do you think that fat guy is reliable?

253
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,180
Why hasn't he come yet?

254
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,180
You two don't worry about the fat guy first.

255
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,180
I spent so much time today, I changed my style on purpose.

256
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,180
Do you think I'm extra beautiful today?

257
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
Not bad.

258
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,180
I think you two are very handsome today.

259
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,180
The people who don't know really think you are some big young master.

260
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,180
Big young master?

261
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,180
Have you seen any big young master who came by taxi and sat on the side of the road alone?

262
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,180
So pitiful.

263
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,180
Fat guy, are you embarrassed to look in the mirror?

264
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,180
I'm sorry.

265
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,180
Come on, come on.

266
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,180
Brother Fat.

267
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,180
Have you waited for a long time?

268
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,180
Whose clothes are you borrowing? It's quite suitable.

269
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,180
Mine.

270
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,180
I was in the village a while ago.

271
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,180
It's too hard. I'm a little bit tired.

272
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,180
What are you laughing at?

273
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,180
I tell you, I wear a dress today.

274
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,180
That old lady asked me to go in. Do you believe it?

275
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,180
Yes.

276
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,180
Okay, give me the ID.

277
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,180
Okay.

278
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
What?

279
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,180
Where can I get you this ID card?

280
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,180
I can find out this place.

281
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,180
Do you know?

282
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,180
Brother Fat, if I don't have an ID card, I can't go in at all.

283
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,180
What should I do?

284
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,180
Don't bother me.

285
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,180
I don't know how I came last night.

286
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,180
You are too unreliable.

287
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,180
Where did you get this thing?

288
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,180
I spent some time last night.

289
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Do it yourself.

290
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,180
Han Shao, I never found you so reliable.

291
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,180
I'm so impressed.

292
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,180
You look good today.

293
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,180
Don't say that.

294
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
This useless thing is useful sometimes.

295
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,180
What?

296
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,180
He is a high-tech talent.

297
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,180
Okay, let's go in if we have a card.

298
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,180
Go.

299
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,180
Okay, next.

300
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,180
Please.

301
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,180
Here you are.

302
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,180
Thank you.

303
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,180
Okay, let me do it.

304
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Brother Fat, you are so good.

305
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,180
The auction is about to start.

306
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
Hurry up.

307
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,180
What are they shooting?

308
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,180
What else can they shoot?

309
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,180
This is the highest place in Beijing.

310
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,180
Old Huo must come to shoot the treasure.

311
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,180
We have to seize the opportunity.

312
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,180
Let's go.

313
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,180
How is it?

314
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
Is it beautiful?

315
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,180
It's so high.

316
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,180
It's so high.

317
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,180
Let me tell you.

318
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,180
Comparing to here,

319
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,180
Panjiayuan and Liulishan are all called land stalls.

320
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,180
So you are a stall owner.

321
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,180
Wu Xie, this girl,

322
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,180
I tell you,

323
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,180
I don't think she is a foreigner.

324
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,180
I would have already paid you.

325
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,180
Wu Xie.

326
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,180
Didn't you say that Panjiayuan is a stall owner?

327
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,180
Let's go.

328
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,180
Let's go.

329
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,180
Hurry up.

330
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,180
The business of the stall is held in three floors of this hotel.

331
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,180
This used to be a place where eunuchs and foreigners often traded.

332
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,180
The trading style here is the style of Chinese and Western.

333
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,180
If so,

334
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,180
the food here should be very delicious.

335
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,180
Why do you think of food?

336
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,180
I'm hungry.

337
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
Please come in.

338
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,180
How?

339
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,180
Remember,

340
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,180
you should mix with Panjiayuan.

341
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,180
He will bring you all these good dishes.

342
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,180
Please come in.

343
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,180
This is the young master of Changsha, Wu's family.

344
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,180
You should find a better place later.

345
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Are you going to sit in the seat or the hall?

346
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,180
Look at our dressing.

347
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,180
It's really fate.

348
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,180
This is the person who sold the wedding dress yesterday.

349
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,180
It's really a family business.

350
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,180
Brother.

351
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,180
Why are you so free to come here?

352
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,180
Wait.

353
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,180
Mr. Chen, have we met before?

354
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,180
Brother, you are here too.

355
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,180
What a coincidence.

356
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,180
You two...

357
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,180
You two know each other?

358
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
No.

359
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,180
Listen to me.

360
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,180
How can you not know each other?

361
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,180
Did you forget that we met at my store yesterday?

362
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,180
We met yesterday.

363
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,180
Today we are here together.

364
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,180
Is this the hotel?

365
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,180
We have a saying in Beijing.

366
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,180
It's not true.

367
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,180
We are brothers in the four seas.

368
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,180
He is my friend.

369
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,180
You are also my friend.

370
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,180
Who is your friend?

371
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
Listen to me.

372
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,180
Give me back the wedding dress.

373
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,180
I won't sell it.

374
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
No.

375
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
Brother, don't be angry.

376
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,180
Why are you so angry?

377
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,180
You said that you would be angry later.

378
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,180
Brother, someone is arguing here.

379
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,180
Please come and have a look.

380
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,180
I didn't force you to sell your wedding dress.

381
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,180
I will say it again.

382
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,180
Give me back the wedding dress.

383
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,180
Sir, let's not be angry.

384
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,180
Let's talk slowly.

385
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,180
Don't be anxious.

386
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,180
She is a good woman.

387
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,180
Let's not offend her.

388
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,180
It's not up to her.

389
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,180
I ask you.

390
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,180
Will you return it?

391
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,180
Listen to me.

392
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,180
Don't be angry.

393
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,180
I can't return that thing.

394
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,180
I sold it yesterday.

395
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,180
But if you really think you are selling it for nothing,

396
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,180
you give me a card.

397
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,180
I earned a lot of money.

398
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,180
I will return half of it to you.

399
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,180
Everyone is doing business.

400
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,180
You can't see me lose money, right?

401
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
You think you are selling flowers.

402
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,180
I don't mean that.

403
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,180
How can you sell flowers?

404
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,180
You wear a suit and tie a tie, right?

405
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,180
No, no, no.

406
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,180
Not necessary.

407
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,180
Do you believe it?

408
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,180
You leave this hotel at night.

409
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,180
I am capable of making you unable to get mixed up in Beijing.

410
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,180
Mr. Li, can you talk to me?

411
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,180
Can you solve the problem like this?

412
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,180
You are not a guest.

413
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,180
I...

414
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,180
How can you talk?

415
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,180
I am sorry.

416
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,180
No loud noise here.

417
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,180
Manager Ma, right?

418
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,180
Actually, we just have a misunderstanding.

419
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,180
We are friends.

420
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,180
Who is your friend?

421
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,180
Give me back the thing.

422
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,180
Guys, let's talk somewhere else.

423
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,180
The card was useful when I entered the door.

424
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,180
Why are you so stupid?

425
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,180
Four cards are useless.

426
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,180
How do I know it will be wrong?

427
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,180
Are you stupid?

428
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,180
Really.

429
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,180
Four.

430
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,180
What's going on?

431
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,180
Your behavior is illegal.

432
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,180
Now there are two ways in front of you.

433
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,180
Either call the police now.

434
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,180
Let the police take you away.

435
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,180
Or leave quickly.

436
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,180
And never enter Xin Yue Hotel again.

437
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,180
Don't be so serious.

438
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,180
Wait.

439
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,180
Do you know who this is?

440
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,180
This is the young master of Changsha Wu family.

441
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,180
Today, I have an important thing to see Mrs. Huo.

442
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,180
Just you guys.

443
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,180
You are disturbing our big thing.

444
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,180
Manager Li, right?

445
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,180
Can you take the responsibility?

446
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,180
We don't care who it is.

447
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,180
We just follow the rules.

448
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,180
Okay.

449
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,180
Since it's like this,

450
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,180
we can only ask Mrs. Huo to explain it in person.

451
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,180
Right?

452
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,180
Let's ask Mrs. Huo.

453
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,180
Manager.

454
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,180
The guest of the Huo family upstairs wants to invite them up.

455
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,180
What's the matter?

456
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,180
Go.

457
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,180
Okay.

458
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,180
This...

459
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,180
These are the guests of the Huo family.

460
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,180
Please give them a chance.

461
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,180
This is a misunderstanding.

462
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,180
Dear guests.

463
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,180
Please come in.

464
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,180
The Huo family?

465
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,180
You are lucky.

466
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,180
Someone is going to support you today.

467
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,180
But don't let me see you again.

468
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,180
I said it was a misunderstanding.

469
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
Yes.

470
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,180
Go back to your work.

471
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,180
Go.

472
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,180
Okay.

473
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,180
Let's go.

474
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,180
Fatty.

475
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,180
We don't have to be kicked out.

476
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,180
Fatty.

477
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,180
What's going on?

478
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,180
What's going on?

479
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,180
Fatty has me in Beijing.

480
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,180
Don't be so stubborn.

481
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,180
They won't recognize the wrong person.

482
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,180
It doesn't matter.

483
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,180
We can't go in.

484
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,180
Let's go.

485
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,180
Let's go.

486
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,180
How is it?

487
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,180
Luckily no one came.

488
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,180
Fatty.

489
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,180
Is this the auction house?

490
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,180
It used to be a theater.

491
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,180
They used to perform opera.

492
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,180
But now it's an auction house.

493
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,180
They do perform opera here.

494
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,180
I heard that in Beijing,

495
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,180
people like to listen to traditional music.

496
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,180
That's right.

497
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,180
People in Beijing like this.

498
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,180
You know what?

499
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,180
In Beijing,

500
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,180
it's the old society.

501
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,180
Only Prince and Princess can come in.

502
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,180
But now,

503
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,180
it's a rich market.

504
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,180
Fatty.

505
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,180
Is this the auction house?

506
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,180
It's a character.

507
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,180
Ordinary people can't go in.

508
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,180
That way.

509
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,180
This way, please.

510
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,180
Please.

511
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,180
Please.

512
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,180
Please.

513
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,180
Please.

514
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,180
It's beautiful again.

515
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,180
Fatty.

516
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,180
Hurry up and order something to eat.

517
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,180
I'm starving.

518
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,180
How can you eat so much?

519
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,180
Why do you order?

520
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,180
I'm hungry.

521
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,180
Stop it.

522
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,180
How can you do this?

523
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,180
A good place like this

524
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,180
is so high-class.

525
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,180
If you don't order something,

526
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,180
you'll be sorry for your stomach.

527
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,180
Just let him eat.

528
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,180
That's right.

529
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,180
You're right.

530
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,180
Come on, waitress.

531
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,180
Come on.

532
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,180
Give her the menu.

533
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,180
Order whatever you want.

534
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,180
Thank you, Fatty.

535
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,180
That's great.

536
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,180
Just pay for it yourself.

537
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,180
Order.

538
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,180
Oh my god.

539
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,180
This is for people to eat.

540
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
Look.

541
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
A plate of bean sprouts.

542
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,180
12,000 yuan.

543
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
Really?

544
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,180
Really.

545
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,180
Really?

546
00:18:40,180 --> 00:19:06,400
That's called the

547
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,180
It's too bad.

548
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,180
What do you want to eat when he asks me to come?

549
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,180
We're here

550
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,180
mainly to see the old lady.

551
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,180
Don't you want

552
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,180
these kind of things on the menu?

553
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,180
Right.

554
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,180
I'll have a pot of tea.

555
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,180
All right, please wait a moment.

556
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
Fatty,

557
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,180
how much is a pot of tea?

558
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,180
1,800 yuan.

559
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,180
It's worth 10% of the cost.

560
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,180
Why are you so mean?

561
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,180
I'm just saying.

562
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,180
It's worth 10% of the cost.

563
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,180
Why are you so mean?

564
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,180
Why don't you order something cheaper?

565
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,180
Keep your voice down.

566
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,180
This is the cheapest.

567
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,180
Here's your tea.

568
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,180
Come on.

569
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,180
I'll do it myself.

570
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,180
Thank you.

571
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,180
100 packs.

572
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,180
It's gone.

573
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,180
Can you pack this?

574
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Why pack it?

575
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,180
It's such an expensive tea.

576
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,180
I'm taking it back to make tea leaves.

577
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,180
I'm so embarrassed.

578
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,180
What's a tea leaf egg?

579
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,180
Brother Sun, you're here.

580
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,180
Fatty, who is he?

581
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,180
Liuli Sun.

582
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,180
Liuli Sun?

583
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,180
Who is Liuli Sun?

584
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,180
You've never been to Beijing City.

585
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,180
Ya is originally a stinky island.

586
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,180
Liuli Zhu.

587
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,180
I don't know what happened later.

588
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,180
It's a big deal.

589
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,180
There are all the treasures in the house.

590
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,180
Ordinary things are not worth looking at.

591
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,180
Only the top-class things are likely to appear.

592
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,180
These years, Ya is a good example of Beijing City.

593
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,180
Where he appears, it means there are high goods.

594
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,180
But it's been years since Ya came out.

595
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,180
Why are you here today?

596
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,180
Didn't you say he was a wind vane?

597
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,180
Maybe there must be something special about this auction.

598
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,180
Where are you going?

599
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,180
I guess there must be a good show today.

600
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,180
Maybe it's a big show.

601
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,180
I'll go get some auction manuals.

602
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,180
See what it is today.

603
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,180
Master Wu, Madam Huo asked you to come upstairs.

604
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,180
You mean Madam Huo?

605
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,180
Miss, you didn't make a mistake, right?

606
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,180
Fatty, didn't you say you didn't find Madam Huo?

607
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,180
I really didn't get the chance to go.

608
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,180
Please.

609
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,180
Please.

610
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,180
Fatty, does Madam Huo know we're looking for her?

611
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,180
The Huo family is not a joke.

612
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Maybe she has some connections with your grandfather.

613
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,180
It's a good chance to meet you.

614
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,180
See if you look like your grandfather.

615
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,180
Come to the Sun Siye.

616
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,180
Sun Siye?

617
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
Really have culture.

618
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,180
You're so great.

619
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,180
Anyway, thank you for taking care of Madam Huo.

620
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,180
Let's go.

621
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,180
We can't be in the wrong place.

622
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Let's go.

623
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,180
Please.

624
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,180
The golden stone is like a string.

625
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,180
The water is like a hairpin.

626
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,180
The red thread is like a silk.

627
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,180
The green leaves are fragrant.

628
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,180
This is a beautiful painting by Liu Xiaochuo.

629
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,180
Please come in.

630
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,180
You're eating money.

631
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,180
Is Madam Huo here?

632
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
It's none of your business.

633
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,180
Don't look down.

634
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,180
Let me tell you.

635
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,180
The New Moon Hotel has not been so lively these two years.

636
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
Eat slowly.

637
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Today, it's rare to follow the old lady of the Huo family.

638
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,180
Let's have a look.

639
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
Isn't it?

640
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,180
Excuse me.

641
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,180
Here.

642
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
Don't look at me.

643
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,180
I'm your partner.

644
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
Let's go.

645
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,180
Madam, I'll be there in a minute.

646
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:10,180
Hello, Aunt Huo. I'm Wu Xie.

647
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,180
I didn't disturb you to rest, right?

648
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
You're Puppy Wu?

649
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,180
You really look like that old dog.

650
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,180
It's hard to believe.

651
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,180
So that dog

652
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,180
really has no trace of it.

653
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,180
Uncle, you must be joking.

654
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,180
It's not that I'm joking.

655
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,180
But you're joking.

656
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,180
It's more like it when you laugh.

657
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,180
It doesn't seem like a good thing.

658
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,180
What are the people next to you doing?

659
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,180
They're here with me.

660
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,180
Get out.

661
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,180
You're not staying in Hangzhou.

662
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,180
Why are you going to Beijing?

663
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Granny, I came here this time

664
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,180
to ask you a favor.

665
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,180
Let's talk after I finish eating.

666
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,180
It's so stuffy in here.

667
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,180
This old man from the bed room

668
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,180
is really strong.

669
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,180
He's really a member of the Huo family.

670
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,180
In his eyes,

671
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
there's a unique beauty of Eastern women.

672
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,180
Enough.

673
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,180
What are you two fighting about?

674
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,180
Have you seen the world?

675
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,180
What's wrong with you?

676
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,180
Let's go.

677
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,180
I'll take you to another place.

678
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,180
There's a lot of fun here.

679
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,180
You're awesome.

680
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,180
What are you doing?

681
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,180
You asked me to stay in the room.

682
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,180
I didn't.

683
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
What are we going to do, Mr. Fatty?

684
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,180
What can we do?

685
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,180
What if Wu Xie is in there?

686
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,180
It's okay.

687
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,180
I'm here.

688
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,180
Sir.

689
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,180
Your jade hairpin fell.

690
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,180
Where's it?

691
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,180
It's not there.

692
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,180
I can't find it.

693
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
I'm looking for it.

694
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,180
I'll find it.

695
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,180
I'll bring it for you.

696
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,180
Okay.

697
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,380
Your jade hairpin fell off.

698
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,300
The jade hairpin and the lady's

699
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,460
face-saving appearance

700
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,700
are a perfect match.

701
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,460
Without a step earlier,

702
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,180
without a step later,

703
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,780
the lady happened to pick it up.

704
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,140
It must be a destiny.

705
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,060
I gave this jade hairpin to the lady.

706
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,500
I wonder if the lady can enjoy it

707
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,660
and go to the room to have a rest.

708
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,580
Sorry, sorry.

709
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,660
I'm from a distant place.

710
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,260
I just came back from Germany.

711
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,700
There's something wrong with it.

712
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,900
It's not healed yet.

713
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,420
Sorry for disturbing you.

714
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,460
You're busy.

715
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,180
Sorry.

716
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,180
What are you doing?

717
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,780
I...

718
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,340
I don't know if he's from the second floor.

719
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,180
What's wrong with the second floor?

720
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,460
I told you you didn't remember.

721
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,620
Those who can go to the second floor

722
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,700
are all handsome.

723
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,020
Why are you looking for him?

724
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,780
That's right.

725
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,260
Everyone in Germany is so naughty.

726
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,620
I said are you crazy?

727
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,740
You're so naughty in Germany.

728
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,860
Are you a commoner?

729
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,020
What's wrong with this list?

730
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:40,760
Did you steal it from the

731
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,060
Panjiayuan's stall?

732
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,380
I didn't say you're a commoner.

733
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,740
You're a secret.

734
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,540
I don't want it.

735
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,100
You're a fat girl.

736
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,580
Can you write a book?

737
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,060
You're a bad girl.

738
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,020
Even the square dance

739
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,540
of my aunt can be seen as fake.

740
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,980
It's embarrassing to be a fat girl.

741
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,180
It means I'm innocent and kind.

742
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,220
I'm not scheming.

743
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:55,940
Miss.

744
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,740
By the way, Dacheng.

745
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,820
I just saw a few people

746
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,100
with good looks.

747
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,340
Where did they come from?

748
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,060
Madam asked them to come.

749
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,620
Grandma asked them to come.

750
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,100
They came with

751
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,060
the young master of the Wu family.

752
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,980
Young master of the Wu family?

753
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,660
Madam asked you to go in.

754
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,220
I see.

755
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,260
By the way, he's almost here.

756
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,020
You go and pick him up.

757
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,220
I'll wait for him here.

758
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,020
Yes.

759
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,340
Life will always

760
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,820
drop small hopes.

761
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,940
I'm so convinced.

762
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,180
Don't say that.

763
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,940
You have a good eye.

764
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,860
That girl is good-looking.

765
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,180
What are you talking about?

766
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,540
I mean,

767
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,180
Wu Xie is in a bad situation now.

768
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,060
The Huo family is hard to deal with.

769
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,660
That's right.

770
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,580
It's too much to drive us out.

771
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,780
They must think we have no origin.

772
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,420
You don't even look at the Huo family.

773
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,780
What are you doing?

774
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,740
What are you talking about?

775
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,140
This one.

776
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,660
If you have the ability, say it in person.

777
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,380
Don't say anything behind my back.

778
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:01,940
What do I say?

779
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,020
It's none of your business.

780
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,700
Brother Pan, forget it. Let's go.

781
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,860
Forget what?

782
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,860
I'm not in a good mood.

783
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,180
The Huo family is so generous.

784
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,700
They are so generous.

785
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,100
They even make a fool of us.

786
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,940
They are really teasing you.

787
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,460
Please step aside.

788
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,700
You want me to step aside?

789
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,940
Our madam is talking for you.

790
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,220
You didn't get kicked out.

791
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,260
Why are you still annoying?

792
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,380
I'm wondering.

793
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,380
Do you think I'm begging you for help?

794
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,260
Step aside.

795
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,940
Han Shang.

796
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,420
Han Shang.

797
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,100
Han Shang, are you okay?

798
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,940
I'm fine.

799
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,100
Fatty is too fat.

800
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,220
He blocked my vision.

801
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
You scared me.

802
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,900
Wake up.

803
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,860
Han Shang.

804
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,860
Han Shang.

805
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,340
Han Shang.

806
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,700
Someone, come here.

807
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,500
Come and give us a salute.

808
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,300
What's going on?

809
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,300
It's a sunny day.

810
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,820
Han Shang.

811
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,460
It's a sunny day.

812
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,060
The Huo family is so rude.

813
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,340
They hit people as they want.

814
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,860
Someone blocked my vision.

815
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,140
Don't make noise here.

816
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,340
Keep pretending.

817
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,740
Even if the Huo family is still respectful,

818
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,780
it's not good for them

819
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,740
if things get worse.

820
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,540
Ladies, you're here at the right time.

821
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,020
You give us a salute.

822
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,860
I...

823
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,500
Han Shang.

824
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,180
Han Shang.

825
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,900
He grew up in Germany.

826
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,940
I saw him grow up

827
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,260
from such a height.

828
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,780
He's been good at studying since he was a kid.

829
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,220
He's the top three in Germany.

830
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,100
But it's the first time

831
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,020
he's come to study with the Wu family.

832
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,020
You said the Huo family is rude.

833
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,620
They hit people as they want.

834
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,340
Right.

835
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,500
Look at his wound.

836
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,340
If he can't tell you,

837
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,340
he'll be a dead man.

838
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,780
Listen,

839
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,620
I didn't hit him.

840
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,060
Han Shang.

841
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,100
He hit him.

842
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,020
Han Shang.

843
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,900
Sir,

844
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,420
we should be polite.

845
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,340
We'll do it.

846
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,300
Just monitor it.

847
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,300
Monitoring is good.

848
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,660
Great.

849
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,940
Come on, lady.

850
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,820
Get up slowly.

851
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,660
You also stand up.

852
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,060
You're just...

853
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,060
Han Shang.

854
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,580
You...

855
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,820
Why are you being polite?

856
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,700
Listen,

857
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,780
everyone is dizzy.

858
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,940
I'm going to the German cinema

859
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,060
to comfort you.

860
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,020
Really.

861
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,780
Han Shang.

862
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,540
Madam.

863
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,860
I'm here to ask you

864
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,260
if you want to

865
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,700
talk about the snake and the copper fish.

866
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,940
Snake and copper fish?

867
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,700
You've come here for nothing.

868
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,100
How is that possible?

869
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,940
Only you know about it

870
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,860
in the Old Nine Gates.

871
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
Who still remembers

872
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,620
such a dirty thing?

873
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,980
Nonsense.

874
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,620
You're a doctor now.

875
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,940
You're a doctor.

876
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,340
How can you not remember?

877
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,500
I'm a little more mature

878
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,180
than that old dog.

879
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,380
You're so smooth-tongued.

880
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,260
You're exactly like that old dog.

881
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,580
How can you be so good?

882
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,100
You've inherited

883
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,340
all the bad things

884
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,220
from me.

885
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,740
Is it because your grandma

886
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,380
asked you to meet me?

887
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,860
See how old I am.

888
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,500
Madam, you've misunderstood.

889
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,900
I just want to ask

890
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,780
about the snake and the copper fish.

891
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,660
To be honest,

892
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,420
I haven't seen my grandma for a long time.

893
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,500
Since my grandpa passed away,

894
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,860
she's been in the old house

895
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,980
and never left the house.

896
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,740
That's because she's bad-sighted

897
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,460
and married a short-lived ghost.

898
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,340
How can you think of

899
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,660
asking me about this?

900
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,700
That old dog

901
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,820
knows much better than me.

902
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,620
Didn't he write it

903
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,860
on his old notebook?

904
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,860
The notebook has been destroyed.

905
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,220
How about

906
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,140
I come to trouble you?

907
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,260
You don't dare

908
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,460
or you don't want to?

909
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,740
I don't want to

910
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,700
trouble you.

911
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,340
Come on.

912
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,860
How do you know this thing?

913
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,780
It's with me.

914
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,500
Where did you steal it?

915
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,660
Madam, I didn't steal it.

916
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,180
There's a group of street vendors

917
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,900
who are very interested in this.

918
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,540
I'm afraid that the cultural relics

919
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,780
will be stolen by the outsiders.

920
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,260
So I want to find out

921
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,180
what the snake-tailed tuna

922
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,500
is for.

923
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,580
The Daomu family

924
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,900
has two generations of

925
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,300
dogs who protect cultural relics.

926
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,500
I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.

927
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,580
If I tell the old dog,

928
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,540
will he get angry

929
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,020
and climb out of the tomb?

930
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,420
Okay, I can promise you.

931
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,100
But you can't ask me.

932
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,980
You have to ask your grandma.

933
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,060
Grandma, let's not joke around.

934
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,220
This thing

935
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:48,940
doesn't have to

936
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,940
disturb my grandma and her family.

937
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,420
Joke?

938
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,940
I don't ask about it.

939
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,340
I, Huo Xian Gu, do business.

940
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,740
I never joke around.

941
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,900
Your grandma and I are childhood friends.

942
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,420
It's been decades.

943
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,340
She never came to see me.

944
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,740
I'm in Hangzhou.

945
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,540
I asked her to come see me.

946
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,260
Is it a joke?

947
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,980
It's settled.

948
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,500
Go back and discuss with your grandma.

949
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,660
If your grandma doesn't want to see me,

950
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,180
you don't have to come to see me.

951
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,500
Song Ke.

952
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,340
You're being unreasonable.

953
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,900
Look.

954
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,500
That's right.

955
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,940
You're too much.

956
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,420
Han Shang.

957
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,100
Is she...

958
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,620
How can you do this?

959
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,740
Han Shang, wake up.

960
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,620
Han Shang, wake up.

961
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,980
You're too much.

962
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,460
What's wrong with you?

963
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,420
Han Shang.

964
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:46,940
Are you okay?

965
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,460
Wu Xie.

966
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,860
They pushed Han Shang.

967
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,620
Look.

968
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,380
She's like this now.

969
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,820
My Peng Gu.

970
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,740
Young Master Wu.

971
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,820
You finally love me.

972
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,940
You give a fair review.

973
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,940
These two guys

974
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,020
are from the Huo family.

975
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,140
They're unreasonable.

976
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,180
They want to drive us out.

977
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,420
They hit us.

978
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,460
Look at the kind of people

979
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,020
they hit.

980
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,780
You're too much.

981
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,300
My tailbone.

982
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,060
They hit people in public.

983
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,980
They're too arrogant.

984
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,300
That's right.

985
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,740
Wu Xie.

986
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,900
What are you doing?

987
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,940
Are you okay?

988
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,700
Young Master Wu is just like this.

989
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,300
Are you serious?

990
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,940
You...

991
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,300
Come on.

992
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,220
Don't touch me.

993
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,980
Don't touch me.

994
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,340
Don't touch me.

995
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,940
Stop.

996
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,780
Who are you?

997
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,780
Who are you?

998
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,660
Who are you?

999
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,180
You're Wu Xie, right?

1000
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,100
Yes.

1001
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,580
I am.

1002
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,420
You are...

1003
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,660
Yuchen.

1004
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,660
Grandma has been waiting for you for a long time.

1005
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,580
Why don't you go up?

1006
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,580
It's so hot.

1007
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,500
Cheng.

1008
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,020
I didn't ask you to pick up so many people.

1009
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,100
You're the guest who just left, right?

1010
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,660
I'm very interested in your conversation.

1011
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,940
Can you tell me?

1012
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,860
It's just about some history.

1013
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,220
And you are...

1014
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,420
Xiu Xiu.

1015
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,260
He is Wu Xie.

1016
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,100
You are indeed the young master of the Wu family.

1017
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,420
Why do you all seem to know me?

1018
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,500
I don't know you.

1019
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,420
I'm Huo Xiu Xiu.

1020
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,380
Since Wu Xie is a friend of Grandma's,

1021
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,660
let's let the bodyguards leave.

1022
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,300
You're wearing a pink shirt.

1023
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,780
You're not afraid of finding your old ass.

1024
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,020
He didn't mean it.

1025
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,780
I'm sorry.

1026
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,100
Don't take it to heart.

1027
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,020
If there's nothing else,

1028
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,020
do you want to come and sit down?

1029
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,100
Young master of the Xie family.

1030
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,140
Could it be that Xie family?

1031
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,620
Which Xie family?

1032
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,020
Is he famous?

1033
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,220
The original Xie family

1034
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,620
is also a member of the Nine Gates.

1035
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,020
In the ancient world of Beijing,

1036
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,820
there is also a number of the Nine Gates.

1037
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,820
I heard that the Xie family is in a marriage with the Huo family.

1038
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,140
Look at the way the young lady of the Huo family

1039
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,020
posted just now.

1040
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,220
You all saw it.

1041
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,620
This pink shirt

1042
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,620
should be her fiance.

1043
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,620
Let's go.

1044
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,620
I have something to say

1045
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,020
to Old Madam Huo.

1046
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,220
This way, please.

1047
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,620
Hello, Boss Zhang, Madam Zhang.

1048
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,820
Granny.

1049
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,820
I'm here to see you.

1050
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,220
I'm here to see you.

1051
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,620
I'm here to see you.

1052
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,620
Sit.

1053
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,220
Didn't I make it very clear to you before?

1054
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,620
If your granny didn't come,

1055
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,220
you wouldn't have to see me.

1056
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,020
I know a little about

1057
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,020
the thing you took.

1058
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,620
But now you're old,

1059
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,020
you can't remember it clearly.

1060
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,220
She said I can't leave.

1061
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,020
It's not easy to see this old witch

1062
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,620
when you're gone.

1063
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,020
What should I do?

1064
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,220
Just play with her.

1065
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,620
Just play with her.

1066
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,620
Just forget about her.

1067
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,820
What's going on?

1068
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,820
Why is everyone like a ghost?

1069
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,220
How would I know?

1070
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,620
Granny.

1071
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,420
This matter is really important to me.

1072
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,820
If you don't tell me,

1073
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,020
we will kneel in front of this restaurant.

1074
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,620
Who told you to sit down?

1075
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,020
Stand up.

1076
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
Stand up.

1077
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,020
Stand up.

1078
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,020
Stand up.

1079
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,020
Stand up.

1080
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,020
Stand up.

1081
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,020
Stand up.

1082
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,020
Stand up.

1083
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,020
Stand up.

1084
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,020
Stand up.

1085
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,020
Cheng.

1086
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,820
Take these rascals away.

1087
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,620
Aomum Xin Peking Entertainment City

1088
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,020
772772

1089
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,820
com.

1090
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,420
The most exciting PG game on the line.

1091
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,820
The mahjong is over.

1092
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,420
The mahjong is over 2.

1093
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,820
The prize-winning queen

1094
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,620
will find the treasure of the Golden City.

1095
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,300
The

1096
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,620
super high rate of compensation

1097
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,620
will get a lot of rewards.

1098
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,420
There are many opportunities to get revenge.

1099
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,820
Hurry up and join.

1100
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,620
Aomum Xin Peking Entertainment City

1101
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,220
772772

1102
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,820
com.

1103
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,220
I've heard that

1104
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,020
the Huo family loves to play.

1105
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,820
Especially you, Mrs. Huo.

1106
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,020
You said you were more popular than the Empress Dowager Siqi.

1107
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,620
Today is a good day.

1108
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,420
But

1109
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,820
if you really let us get these pieces of material,

1110
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,220
it will show that you are very careful, right?

1111
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,420
But our Young Master Mu

1112
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,620
is very popular.

1113
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,820
He is very old and young.

1114
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,220
But Fatty Wang

1115
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,420
is a rascal since he was a child.

1116
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,220
He has a bad temper.

1117
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,220
If he gets angry later,

1118
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,220
and gets hit by this place,

1119
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,420
it will be bad for the reputation of the Huo family.

1120
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,420
Cheng,

1121
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,220
send the guest in.

1122
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,420
Please.

1123
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,420
Don't come over.

1124
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,220
I'll call the police if you come over.

1125
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,620
Let go.

1126
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,620
You are also good-natured.

1127
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,420
You are not as smart as you.

1128
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,020
You don't want to play?

1129
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,420
Aomum,

1130
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,220
don't be angry about this.

1131
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,820
Fatty Wang is also talking nonsense.

1132
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,820
Besides,

1133
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,220
Wu Xie is also the Young Master of the Wu family.

1134
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,620
We don't have to

1135
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,020
get along with our family.

1136
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,220
Aomum,

1137
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,020
if you don't agree,

1138
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,220
I won't leave.

1139
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,420
Okay.

1140
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,420
I'm afraid of you.

1141
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,620
Young Master Wu,

1142
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,620
but don't ask me first.

1143
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,020
Even if you ask,

1144
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,620
I won't say anything.

1145
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,420
You just sit here

1146
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,220
until four thirty.

1147
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,020
If you can sit,

1148
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,220
I won't make it difficult for you.

1149
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,420
Okay.

1150
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,220
Open your misty eyes

1151
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,220
Here comes another fight

1152
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,220
There's a stormy night

1153
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,220
Before the morning arrives

1154
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,220
No matter where you go

1155
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,220
I will follow you

1156
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,220
Keep careful watch

1157
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,220
Of your soul

1158
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,220
Smashing through the door

1159
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,220
Into another world

1160
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,220
Picking up my sword

1161
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:02,220
Nothing I can conquer

1162
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,220
I'll keep carrying on

1163
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,220
We have to fight

1164
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,220
We have to be strong

1165
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,220
Still a long long way to go

1166
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:21,220
Until I see the sun

1167
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:25,220
I see the light

1168
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,220
I hear the triumph

1169
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,220
Let's solve the mystery

1170
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,220
And never dream

1171
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:41,220
I see the light

1172
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,220
I hear the triumph

1173
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:49,220
Let's write our story

1174
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,220
Let's make our fantasy

1175
00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:00,220
Come true

1176
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,220
We have to rock

1177
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:16,220
On our own

1178
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,220
Making our fantasy

1179
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:23,220
Come true

1180
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,220
On our own

1181
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:07,380
I see the light

1182
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,580
I hear the triumph

1183
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,820
Let's write our story

1184
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:27,420
Let's make our fantasy come true

1185
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:37,220
I see the light

1186
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,220
I hear the triumph

1187
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:45,220
Let's solve the mystery

1188
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:49,220
And live a dream

1189
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:54,220
I see the light

1190
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:58,220
I hear the triumph

1191
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,220
I see the light

1192
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,220
I hear the triumph

1193
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:08,220
Let's write our story

1194
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:22,220
Let's make our fantasy come true

1195
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:32,220
Come true
