6
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:33,990
Oh, my.

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,600
(I've become Su Qianyu.)

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,960
Qianyu, what are you saying?

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,800
Don't touch me.

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,350
I've lived a life of wisdom.

11
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,520
Who would've thought
I'd end up so undignified?

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,160
Su Qianyu.

13
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,990
Are you all right?

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,790
Are you Qi Xuan?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,070
Do you still recognize me?

16
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,640
I warn you.

17
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,040
Don't use my body

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,480
to make such expressions and poses.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,680
If you ruin my reputation outside,

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
I will not let you off.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,950
It seems you're fine.

22
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,790
You scared me.

23
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,270
Well.

24
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,200
Girls don't sit like that.

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,310
Keep your legs closed.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,310
I don't do that kind of girlish pose.

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,480
Right.

28
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,350
The book says reliving

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,000
the experience before the body swap
can help us

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,040
change back.

31
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,350
How about

32
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,350
we try it?

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,240
How do we do that?

34
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,710
Last time, you choked me hard

35
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,710
on the neck.

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,140
Endure it.

37
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,990
We'll switch soon.

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,400
It's almost done.

39
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,230
We lay here to switch bodies that day.

40
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,240
Use the blanket.

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,000
It's chilly at night.

42
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,080
What if you catch a cold

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,520
and ruin my health?

44
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,590
Let's sleep.

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,520
We'll switch back by morning.

46
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,750
I'm sleeping with myself
for the first time.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,710
Are you feeling awkward?

48
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,400
You...

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,360
Stop acting like a girl

50
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,000
with my body.

51
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,560
(It feels great being a prince.)

52
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,150
Do you feel comfortable like this?

53
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,560
Yeah, very comfortable.

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,190
Prince, please try this.

55
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,740
Not tasty.

56
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,310
(I need to seize this moment
to get that painting.)

57
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,990
Everyone, leave us.

58
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,310
What did you say at Wind Pavilion?

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,240
Princess Su had been left alone at home.

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,800
Once Prince Su returned,
he even treated her violently.

61
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,910
Dear audience,

62
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,180
isn't that utterly shameless

63
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,190
(Wind Pavilion)
and outrageous?

64
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,080
Nonsense.

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,920
Go, go, go.

66
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,870
Who is this brat,

67
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,360
daring to cause a ruckus here?

68
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,840
Wind Pavilion?

69
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,980
(Wind Pavilion)

70
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,430
It truly lives up to its name.

71
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,630
The wind carries rumors.

72
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,680
How dare you spread rumors
and smear others?

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,270
When did Princess Su become
a domestic abuser?

74
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,270
Who made you turn the truth upside down
and spout nonsense here?

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,040
Storytellers are here
to entertain everyone

76
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,800
with various stories.

77
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,160
Isn't that right, everyone?

78
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,480
Yes.

79
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,240
Full of nonsense.

80
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,230
What are you saying?

81
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,310
(Sang Zhi, Scholar)
Sang Zhi.

82
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,560
The legendary new top scholar,
beautiful and wise.

83
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,720
The youngest scholar of Hanlin Academy.

84
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,190
The grandson of the richest
man in Jinling City.

85
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,070
The Wind Pavilion is well-known.

86
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,480
The owner, Mr. Wang,
is famously friendly.

87
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,000
If you resort to violence at your door

88
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,600
due to a small misunderstanding,

89
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,920
that's quite unbecoming.

90
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,070
Mr. Sang, it makes sense,

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,830
but he's falsely accusing us
of being bribed,

92
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,830
ruining our reputation

93
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,600
and our livelihoods.

94
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
How could I let him go?

95
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,870
Who needs that?

96
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,390
Come at me if you dare.

97
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,110
Xuan.

98
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,230
Why did you leave so soon?

99
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,950
What did you just call me?

100
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,960
Xuan.

101
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,950
Are you hurt from just now?

102
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,920
Sang Zhi has always been
at odds with me in court.

103
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,190
I had no idea he was so close
to Qi Xuan.

104
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,430
