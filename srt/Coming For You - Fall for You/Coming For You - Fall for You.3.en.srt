=Episode 3=

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,960
What exactly did you say
at Wind Pavilion?

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,840
The Wind Pavilion is well-known.

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,350
The owner, Mr. Wang,
is famously friendly.

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,030
If you resort to violence at your door

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,710
due to a small misunderstanding,

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,200
that's quite unbecoming.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,750
But he's falsely accusing us
of being bribed,

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,670
ruining our reputation

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,430
and our livelihoods.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How could I let him go?

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,710
Who needs that?

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,430
Come at me if you dare.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,350
I don't know what you mean.

19
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,200
What's wrong with going there?

20
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,110
Do you dare say you really don't know?

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,230
Are you brave enough
to confront me there?

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,070
I didn't do anything.

23
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,240
Why confront you?

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,120
Whatever you say, we must go.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm not going.

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,020
(Wind and Fortune)

27
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,420
(Righteousness)

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,920
(I just wanted to use rumors
to hold Su Qianyu back)

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,680
(so I could look for the painting.)

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,950
(How did it turn out like this?)

31
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,230
(Who will come to my rescue?)

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,150
Mr. Sang, you suddenly came.

33
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,040
What brings you here?

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,560
I'm looking for the princess,

35
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,920
not you.

36
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,840
Since when did you become so familiar

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,120
with the princess?

38
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,400
No need to explain.

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,470
You have the right to choose friends.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
I won't intervene.

41
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,560
If I hadn't known you for years,

42
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,800
I might have believed that.

43
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,240
(You little brat.)

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,960
(Who's the sarcasm for?)

45
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,030
You suppress
and coerce your wife,

46
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,190
lacking even the most basic trust.

47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
You must bear the consequences
of your actions.

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,360
Mr. Sang, speak carefully.

49
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,310
As a fifth-rank official
of Hanlin Academy,

50
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,910
how can you be disrespectful
to the prince?

51
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,240
You're spouting nonsense.

52
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,280
The prince hasn't
made things hard for you,

53
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,240
which shows his magnanimity.

54
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,030
Xuan,

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,360
don't mind him.

56
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,430
If he truly harms you,

57
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,430
I'll help you no matter what.

58
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,310
(Oh, no.)

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,000
(Su Qianyu wouldn't think
I've cheated on him, right?)

60
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,520
Wait, wait.

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,520
Slow down a bit.

62
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,080
Can't you say it in the main hall?

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,710
Why go back to the bedchamber?

64
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,240
If the servants see, I'll lose face.

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,470
Do you care about your reputation?

66
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,360
Do as you would be done by.

67
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,310
Why are you so merciless
when you smear my name?

68
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,270
How do you know?

69
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,840
I didn't.

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,960
I didn't. Don't smear me.

71
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,590
Fine.

72
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,960
I'll let the matter
about Wind Pavilion go for now.

73
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,800
Tell me. Who's Mr. Sang to you?

74
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,710
Sang Zhi?

75
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,520
Don't you know him?

76
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,910
A well-known celebrity in the city.

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,400
Do I have to introduce him to you?

78
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,150
Stop playing dumb with me.

79
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,910
I'm asking

80
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,070
what your relationship is.

81
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,430
I said that making friends
was my freedom.

82
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,190
Do I need your approval for everything?

83
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,040
Before doing anything,
why don't you reflect on yourself?

84
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,510
(Still flaunting your former power.)

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,360
(But you're not the prince anymore.)

86
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,160
(I can lock you up anytime.)

87
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,830
(Then I can truly do as I please.)

88
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,680
Self-reflection, huh?

89
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,790
Fine.

90
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,070
Proclaim my decree:

91
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,000
The princess is to reflect for ten days.

92
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,600
Without my orders,

93
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,120
no one can release her.

94
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,110
You...

95
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,000
Amitabha, Amitabha.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,270
I just came to find a painting.

97
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,270
