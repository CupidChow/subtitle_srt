I'm Qi Xuan,
an ancient painting appraiser.

7

(Spirit Tablet)

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,160
(Changze)
Due to a painting,

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,120
I got trapped in a dynasty
that history never recorded,

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,350
the Great Yan.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,200
Not only did I accidentally swap bodies,

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,200
but I was caught up
in the struggle for the throne.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,720
At the same time,

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,920
Yue Yunwan, adopted by the late prince,
met the Crown Prince.

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,680
(Yue Residence)
You're quite the strategist.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,560
Just a pawn on the board.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,240
Whether it'll be useful,

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,840
we'll have to wait.

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,920
(Mansion of Prince Su)
Why are you still awake?

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,350
I can't sleep.

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,850
You teased me during the day.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,680
Stop the nonsense.

23
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,120
The Crown Prince might
do something these days.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,590
Take guards when you go out.

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,560
Got it, got it.

26
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,510
Worrying too much
will make you age faster.

27
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,120
What should we do? I'm scared.

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,960
Hide; don't come out.

29
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,150
Luoyun!

30
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,680
Are you okay?

31
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,680
I'm fine.

32
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,920

- Yes!

53
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,750
I heard there's a painting
of a beauty in the palace.

It has a significant connection to me.

55
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
I want that painting.

56
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,520
I can't help you.

57
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,390
Just tell me if you can do it.

58
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,720
I'll agree to everything else,

59
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,910
except for this.

60
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,600
But I don't want anything else.

61
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,950
I only want that painting.

62
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,870
At least tell me why you want it.

63
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,070
What are you hiding?

64
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,800
Su Qianyu,

65
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,950
you said before that we would

66
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,720
face any challenges together.

67
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,560
Now, I'm just asking for a painting,

68
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,480
yet you're dodging the issue.

69
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,430
I should've known.

70
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,390
A man's promises are full of lies.

71
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,610
Stop changing the subject.

72
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,730
I just want to know
why you need the painting.

73
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
What are you hiding?

74
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,270
You can't just want it for no reason.

75
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,190
Are you saying I'm being unreasonable?

76
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,270
Yes.

77
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,630
Since you said that, fine.
I'm unreasonable.

78
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,120
I don't deserve you, Prince Su.

79
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,800
Take care. Leave!

80
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,680
(What are you hiding?)

81
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,920
(What secret does that painting hold?)

82
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,390
(You're afraid of me finding out.)

83
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,870
(Full of Fortune)

84
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,830
The princess and Nai have been looking
for the painting in the mansion.

85
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,360
That's why
she visited the forbidden area.

86
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,830
Since the princess came here,

87
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,630
she only left to meet with Mr. Sang,

88
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,370
without contact with the Eastern Palace.

89
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,750
So, the assassin that night

90
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,950
likely had nothing to do with her.

91
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,960
It just so happens

92
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,390
that Miss Yue met Crown Prince by chance
on the eve of her departure.

93
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,070
What really happened
is still under investigation.

94
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,640
I understand.

95
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,390
- Watch the Eastern Palace.
- Yes.

96
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,240
It's a time of turmoil.

97
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,190
You should be more vigilant.

98
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,710
You're right.

99
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,880
So...

100
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,310
How to coax an angry woman?

101
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,360
Prince, your question
takes quite a turn.

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,070
Family harmony matters.

103
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,270
If I can't even manage my family,

104
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,130
let alone great matters.

105
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,510
As expected of you,

106
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,980
always thinking ahead.

107
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,950
My humble skills are lacking

108
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,870
and can hardly ease your burdens.

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,680
I happen to have
some teaching materials.

110
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,040
I hope they might
offer you some insight.

111
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,000
Want to win me over with these?

112
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,120
From now on,

113
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,030
I'll present

114
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,000
anything you like to you.

115
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,440
Let me tell you a story.

116
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,320
A girl loves to eat pears.

117
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,200
A boy loves to eat apples.

118
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,550
To express his love, the boy

119
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,600
gave the girl a cart of apples.

120
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,670
But the girl loves pears.

121
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,320
Do you understand?

122
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,600
Whether you like apples or pears,

123
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,570
I'll give them to you.

124
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,150
All I want is the painting.

125
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,000
But you can't give it to me.

126
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,870
So all of this is worthless to me.

127
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,200
(It seems this trick
from the storybook isn't working.)

128
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,150
All I want is the painting.

129
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,240
Don't ask me for the reason;
I won't tell you.

130
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,030
I'll only take the painting.

131
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,990
It's up to you.

132
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,040
