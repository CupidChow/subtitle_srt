=Episode 13=

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,030
When I was four,

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,170
my father went on his usual tour,

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,600
and the imperial consorts

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,230
- managed to eliminate her.
- Open the door!

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,900
Is anyone there?

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,670
So, you...

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,400
You are...

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,590
Yes.

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,520
I'm the emperor's firstborn son.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,600
I'm the true heir.

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,600
When the strange fire occurred,

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,030
the consorts involved bribed
the servants of Fengyi Palace,

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,640
leaving no trace behind.

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,560
Luckily, the late prince
arrived and rescued me.

20
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,270
But as for my mother,

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,030
she wasn't saved in time

22
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,560
and died on the spot.

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,400
My suspicion was right.

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,840
The signature is not Changze,
but Changyuan.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,020
(Chang)

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
But why

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,040
didn't you reveal your identity
to the emperor later?

28
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,550
The late prince and my mom's past
was the subject of rumors.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,840
The late prince delayed
the march to save me,

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,740
leading to a military defeat.

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,710
He was harshly criticized,
resigned in disgrace,

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,920
and passed away in sorrow.

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,230
For my mother's honor,

34
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,430
he never engraved his handwriting
on the spirit tablet.

35
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,070
If I suddenly reveal the truth now,

36
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,070
wouldn't all his efforts be in vain?

37
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,640
How would others
view their relationship?

38
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,070
How would they slander my mother?

39
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,640
So he turned the room into a shrine.

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,480
No wonder he made the shrine
a forbidden area.

41
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,840
If people were

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,040
to find out those paintings were
for mourning the late empress,

43
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,030
there would be big trouble.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,030
All these years,
I've indeed made many plans,

45
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,280
but not to seize power.

46
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,030
I just want justice for my mother.

47
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,270
Unfortunately,

48
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,630
all the servants involved
in the Fengyi incident

49
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,750
died mysteriously.

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,380
There's no evidence
against Consort Xian,

51
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,680
so I can only wait.

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,120
Have you

53
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,750
never told anyone about this before?

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,470
Actually, sometimes
saying things out loud

55
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,800
can bring relief.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,630
You've said that I could rely on you.

57
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,190
Likewise,

58
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,910
you can also tell me

59
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,400
what's in your mind.

60
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,750

Qianyu, no need to be so formal.

67
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,910
Just now, Great Zhou
sent the tribute list for this year.

68
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,560
Compared to the past,
it's even more abundant.

69
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,800
Achieving such results

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
is largely thanks to you.

71
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,030
Your Majesty, I only did my humble duty.

72
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,190
Great Zhou signed the alliance treaty

73
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,280
out of respect for our emperor.

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,030
I dare not take credit.

75
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,910
For the alliance treaty,

76
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,030
I'll certainly reward you generously.

77
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,280
If you have any wishes,

78
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,920
feel free to ask.

79
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,000
Prince Su, why such modesty?

80
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,560
Do you fear the emperor can't
grant the reward you desire?

81
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,470
Very well.

82
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,630
Tell me what you want.

83
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,910
In that case,

84
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,800
Your Majesty,

85
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,870
please grant me Firefly Scroll.

86
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,830
Is there anything else?

87
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,950
I will grant any request.

88
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,360
The Minister of Rites is favoring
a concubine and has been caught

89
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,230
in rumors,

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,950
harming our official's reputation.

91
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,510
Your Majesty, please punish him.

92
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,920
Prince, you're quite concerned,

93
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,160
even taking over the role of the censor.

94
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,270
If I recall correctly,

95
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,510
the Minister of Rites
just lost his wife.

96
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,560
If he doesn't have a wife,

97
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,830
why can't he promote his concubine?

98
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,560
We've always valued
status and propriety.

99
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,560
His wife's body is barely cold.

100
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,830
If the concubine were to take charge,

101
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,470
even if she's not promoted,

102
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,220
it'll cost the minister's honor.

103
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,950
Also, I've investigated and confirmed

104
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,160
that the concubine is behind the death
of the minister's wife.

105
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,920
She's unworthy of her position

106
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,950
and can't be allowed
to continue acting rashly.

107
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,560
Qianyu has a point.

108
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,490
No precedent should be set.

109
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,000
The Minister of Rites
shall be demoted three ranks

110
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,340
as a warning to others.

111
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,830
As for that concubine,

112
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,800
since there is evidence,

113
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,600
let the Ministry of Justice handle her.

114
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,600
Your Majesty,

115
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,470
the Book Drying Festival is approaching.

116
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,270
The Ministry of Rites is busy.

117
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,600
I'm willing to share that burden.

118
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,630
Then the Book Drying Festival

119
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,190
will be handled by Qianyu.

120
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

121
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,360
I didn't expect Prince Su

122
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,870
to be such a champion of justice.

123
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,430
You'd better stop now.

124
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,310
Do you think I don't know
the Minister's concubine

125
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,190
is your distant niece?

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,120
Her way of doing things

127
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,040
is just like yours.

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,240
Your Majesty, I...

129
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,080
Enough.

130
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,830
No need to say more.

131
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,520
I'm tired.

132
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,590
You may leave.

133
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,880
Nai,

134
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,160
I suddenly want pastries
from Qingmu Resto.

135
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,040
Okay, Miss. Wait here.
I'll go buy them for you.

136
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,120
One came from a painting,

137
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,270
fading away without a trace.

138
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,820
(Great Fortune-Teller)

139
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,630
Miss, you don't belong here, do you?

140
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,600
If you're feeling lost,

141
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,870
I can give you some guidance.

142
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,470
Really?

143
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,190
Why not give it a try?

144
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,950
Your Highness, news from the palace:

145
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,680
Consort Xian has been confined.

146
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,230
Understood.

147
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,910
You may leave.

148
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,790
Yes.

149
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,160
Confined?

150
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,320
Ten years ago, Consort Xian's father
held military power,

151
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,270
so I couldn't touch her.

152
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,240
Ten years later,

153
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,840
she is the Crown Prince's mother,

154
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,870
so I still can't touch her.

155
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,510
What's wrong?

156
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,750
I just want justice for my mother,

157
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,270
but in reality,

158
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,790
he can't even punish her properly.

159
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,670
If His Majesty turns a blind eye,

160
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,510
will you give up on justice?

161
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,720
It's wrong to place all your hopes
on someone else.

162
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,960
Whatever you want,

163
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,200
you should fight for it yourself.

164
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,910
Whether it's the truth

165
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,080
or something else.

166
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,000
If I also want to win you over,

167
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
what should I do?

168
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,550
We are already married.

169
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,790
It doesn't mean love.

170
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,720
You keep talking about love,

171
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,150
but do you even know me?

172
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,120
Do you know what I want,

173
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
what I fear,

174
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,600
what I like,

175
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,030
or what I dislike?

176
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,350
Your name is Qi Xuan.

177
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,060
You used to be
an ancient painting appraiser.

178
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,470
We've been married for a year.

179
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,790
Before,

180
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,150
we were very happy.

181
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,080
Don't worry.

182
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,030
