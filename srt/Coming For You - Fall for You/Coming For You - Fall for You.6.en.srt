6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,800
How unreasonable.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,120
Your Majesty,

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,120
is this how you treat guests
in Great Yan?

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,710
What we want is for the prince
to sign the alliance treaty?

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,550
Of course.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,240
To get the client to sign the contract?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,600
I'm familiar with this.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,640
No need to trouble you.

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,430
I will certainly fulfill the mission.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,240
This is the envoy's guesthouse.

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,390
If something happens to me,

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,880
what if war breaks out between us?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,960
For a friendly neighbor,

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,000
we must treat you

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,040
as an honored

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,320
guest.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,480
This sword

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,070
must be the renowned Star Dragon, right?

24
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,230
I've heard you like good swords.

25
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,710
On behalf of Great Yan,
I present it to you.

26
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,430
I hope you like it.

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
I do like it.

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,280
If so, how about we find another place

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,230
and clear up the misunderstanding?

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,070
You pitied the lady

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,680
and encouraged my concubine to escape.

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,560
You've admitted this stunning act.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,950
What's to clear up?

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
You got me wrong.

35
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,510
When I saved her,

36
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,790
I had no idea of her identity.

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,070
I only saw her as a foreign girl,

38
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,920
injured all over in our country.

39
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,870
I kindly offered my help,

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,640
with no improper intentions.

41
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,070
Are you sure?

42
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,350
Of course.

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,760
Your Highness.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,560
Everyone knows my feelings for my wife.

45
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,520
I have no improper relations
with your concubine.

46
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,400
I didn't really want to hit her.

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,910
I just got angry
every time I saw her flirting

48
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,150
with other men.

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,400
After hitting her,
I always regretted it.

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,800
(This domestic abuser is garbage.)

51
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,030
(Let it go.)

52
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,280
(I can't afford to ruin the grand plan.)

53
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,240
It's natural to feel jealous,

54
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,360
but a man hitting a woman
always loses grace.

55
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,840
Women are meant to be pampered.

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,560
You need to treat her well.

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,000
That's the ultimate way to keep her.

58
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,840
You're so lucky!

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,240
You triumphed completely!

60
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,000
- You won.
- Really?

61
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,680
What are you doing? Pay.

62
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,630
I've won every game
with money as a newbie.

63
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,190
I feel so embarrassed.

64
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,360
Sales guideline No. 1:

65
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,430
utilize a sense of security
and scarcity marketing.

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,910
You need not be surprised.

67
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,840
This is the newbie's luck.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,150
Newbies are just lucky.

69
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,840
Not long ago,
the envoys from Jing visited.

70
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,800
They won quite a bit

71
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,590
of money at this table.

72
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,150
Envoys from Great Jing?

73
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,470
Naturally.

74
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,190
Aside from Great Zhou,

75
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,960
we can have more options.

76
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,360
But if we choose Great Jing,

77
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,190
you'll be caught in a pincer attack.

78
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,870
It won't be easy for you.

79
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,150
Sales guideline No. 2:

80
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,280
a sense of value
and self-satisfaction are essential.

81
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,710
But after all,

82
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,120
the old friendship remains.

83
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,680
We won't forget righteousness
for profit.

84
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,840
In the end, who we'll choose

85
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,150
is obvious with you

86
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,310
sitting here today.

87
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,310
- Yes.
- Right.

88
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,800
We have military strength.

89
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,680
You have iron mines.

90
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,360
We have soldiers.

91
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,510
You have weapons.

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,600
We can make a strong alliance.

93
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,950
Sales guideline No. 3:
emotional appeal is also necessary.

94
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,360
About the last archery event,

95
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,720
I did something wrong,

96
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,870
but you provoked me first.

97
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,920
We both made mistakes.

98
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,310
Please accept my apology.

99
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,120
We've played mahjong and shared drinks.

100
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,480
We'll be brothers from now on.

101
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,960
Of course.

102
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,390
If you cannot decide on this matter,

103
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,560
no need to force it.

104
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,070
We all understand.

105
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,870
Surviving in the palace is difficult.

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,360
It's even harder to stand out.

107
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,590
Bring me a pen.

108
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,070
(The method of provoking is crude)

109
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,950
(but always practical.)

110
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,640
Here.

111
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,830
This is to you.

112
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,870
I wish you and your wife a long

113
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,800
and happy life together.

114
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,750
Thank you.

115
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,560
Cheers!

116
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,160
I've long heard you guys
are affectionate.

117
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,560
Your father admired the late empress,

118
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,630
but he couldn't express it
for the emperor's sake.

119
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,480
In the end, he married his wife,

120
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,040
refusing to consummate the marriage.

121
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,560
What a scandal!

122
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,360
It's a top secret.

123
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,830
How did you learn of this?

124
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,510
The two countries

125
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,800
have fought for decades.

126
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,190
We surely have the means

127
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,070
to inquire about your royal scandals.

128
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,800
Your father was brave
and skilled in battle,

129
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,680
but suddenly, he retired from the field.

130
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,800
Our spies

131
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,800
tried very hard

132
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,510
to uncover such information.

133
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,720
No more talk.

134
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,110
Let's drink.

135
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,030
Cheers!

136
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,350
What?

137
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,240
He's fooling around with the prince
at the Drunken Tower?

138
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes, that's truly excessive,

139
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
ignoring your reputation.

140
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,510
Take another man to drink, huh?

141
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,750
I won't go back.

142
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,270
Not everyone wants to go

143
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,120
to the Mansion of Prince Su.

144
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,560
Be careful; walls have ears.

145
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,580
Please be cautious.

146
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,440
Cautious with what?

147
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,920
I'll just say it.

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,920
Kill me if you can.

149
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,070
Just chop me down.

150
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,830
Anyway, it's not my body.

151
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,950
What's so good about being a prince?

152
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,240
Always anxious and fearful.

153
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,040
Nothing is right; nothing is allowed.

154
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,830
I just want to lie down and do nothing.

155
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,510
Anyway, no work and no trouble.

156
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,270
If I don't keep an eye on you,
you'll get into trouble.

157
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,510
You're really a worry.

158
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,270
I said I could handle it, right?

159
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,270
Luoyun,

160
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,560
bring me the alliance treaty.

161
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,560
We can always fight with Great Zhou.

162
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
Why must you suffer like this?

163
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,630
I don't even know how you managed
to convince that Great Zhou prince.

164
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,070
Without bloodshed,

165
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,950
you avoided the suffering of battle.

166
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,240
It's indeed a good strategy.

167
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,510
When you married me,
you were crying and sobbing.

168
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,630
Now, you're so clever and resilient.

169
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,920
How many faces do you have?

170
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,240
Who are you?

171
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,750
How come you look so much like me?

172
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,750
Let me tell you a secret about myself.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,750
I actually come
from a very distant place.

174
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,720
You're confused.

175
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,480
Your father's house may be far,

176
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,080
but it's half a day's journey.

177
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,200
I'm not talking about that place.

178
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,750
I'm talking about my home.

179
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,510
If you want to go back,

180
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,630
I'll send someone to take you tomorrow.

181
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,470
Really?

182
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,790
I never break my word.
