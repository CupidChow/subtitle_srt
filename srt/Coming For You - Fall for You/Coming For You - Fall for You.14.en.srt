00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,230
It's wrong to place all your hopes
on someone else.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,190
Whatever you want,

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,430
you should fight for it yourself.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,240
Whether it's the truth

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,430
(Full of Fortune)

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,520
or something else.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,280
If I also want to win you over,

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,350
what should I do?

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,960
We are already married.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,000
It doesn't mean love.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,840
How is it?

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,790
(Great Fortune-Teller)
All things arise from fate.

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,400
Fate has come.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,150
Resistance is futile.

20
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,640
However, fate always ends.

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,150
In the end, we always
return to the starting point.

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,740
What kind of answer is that?

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,230
As for where to go, follow your heart.

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,920
You must have made your decision.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,070
(But in the end, I will leave.)

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,760
(I cannot give you the love you want.)

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,710
You keep talking about love,

28
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,590
but do you even know me?

29
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,350
Do you know what I want,

30
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,150
what I fear,

31
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,840
what I like,

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,070
or what I dislike?

33
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,000
You can't answer any of that.

34
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,480

Loving someone

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,800
isn't like analyzing
military intelligence.

40
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,800

I know you want this painting,

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,080
but now is not the time.

50
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,960
I won't ask you why again,

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,590
but please trust me.

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,280
One day, I will give it to you.

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,590
(This painting looks like the one
I'm searching for.)

54
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,590
(But something feels off.)

55
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,840
Rumor has it

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,310
that during a banquet
after the Book Drying Festival,

57
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,710
a corner was burned.

58
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,750
Since then, it's been stored away,

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
only to resurface

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,310
centuries later.

61
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,190
So careless.

62
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,800
If it were undamaged,

63
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,810
its price could've
multiplied several times.

64
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,750
Some things are beautiful
because of their flaws.

65
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,960
If it weren't for that fire,

66
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,310
it might not have survived until now.

67
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,500
I suppose everything
has worked out for the best.

68
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
(Maybe)

69
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,150
(this is my only chance
to get the painting.)

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,240
Is any major event coming soon
in the palace?

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,240
Major event?

72
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,240
What do you mean?

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,390
An event worthy

74
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,000
of a grand celebration.

75
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,400
The empress dowager's birthday
is coming.

76
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,590
Why do you ask?

77
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,230
(As I thought.)

78
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,870
(The birthday banquet.)

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,070
(If I can please the empress dowager,)

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
(the painting will be mine easily.)

81
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,680
Leave the empress dowager's

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,780
birthday banquet to me.

83
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,630
With such a virtuous wife,

84
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,600
you're truly fortunate.

85
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,800
You have a concubine.

86
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,920
My foolish princess can't compare.

87
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,360
I didn't realize you've been

88
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,800
spending all your time

89
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,480
with a woman in the chamber.

90
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,480
What's wrong with women?

91
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,750
Do you look down on us?

92
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,800
Nuwa, a woman, mended the heavens.

93
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
Jingwei, a woman, filled the sea.

94
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,000
Even Consort Xian,
who gave birth to you, is a woman.

95
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,750
Only those incapable
would use gender as an excuse.

96
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,590
You...

97
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,160
So sharp-tongued.

98
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,750
I'm pleased to have

99
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,800
such a sharp-tongued princess.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
I've spoiled her.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,120
Please forgive her.

102
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,030
Your Highness, why are you here?

103
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,830
I saw this hairpin perfect for you,

104
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,510
so I bought it.

105
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,270
Your Highness,
is something troubling you?

106
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,800
I don't want to burden you.

107
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,360
Is it about Prince Su?

108
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,000
Prince Su's been targeting my mother

109
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,830
and me for reasons unknown.

110
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,960
Matters of the court

111
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,470
need not trouble you.

112
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,310
After all, you're Prince Su's sister.

113
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,070
My family and Prince Su's have grudges.

114
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,950
Once I've avenged the massacre,

115
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,040
I will repay them
for raising me with my life.

116
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,510
But now, I belong to you.

117
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,510
I should be thinking of you.

118
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,000
(Judging by Princess Su's
demeanor today,)

119
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,580
(she'll steal the spotlight
at the birthday banquet.)

120
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,070
(If that's the case,)

121
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,200
(I might as well let these two women
have a go at each other.)

122
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,390
I truly love you.

123
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't want you to get involved.

124
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,830
This issue, in the end,

125
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,680
may well be tied to that matter.

126
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,030
I've sent people

127
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,510
to gather evidence for your family case.

128
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,390
We will surely clear

129
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,160
your family's name.

130
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,630
If my family's injustice
can be rectified,

131
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,240
I'll serve you with unwavering loyalty.

132
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,190
The empress dowager's
birthday is coming.

133
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,240
Father values filial piety.

134
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,510
If you can win
the empress dowager's favor,

135
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,510
Father will surely award you.

136
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,830
If Father decrees a retrial
of your family case,

137
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,830
it will go much more smoothly.

138
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,360
I will not disappoint you.

139
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,900
(Mansion of Prince Su)

140
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,240
What's keeping you busy?

141
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,560
Isn't it obvious?

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,970
I'm preparing
for the empress dowager's birthday.

143
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,390
What is this peculiar thing?

144
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,190
I've never seen it.

145
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,230
This?

146
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,560
It's called a birthday cake.

147
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,830
A specialty from my hometown.

148
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,930
Master Qi has something like this?

149
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,510
It's not important.

150
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,480
Anyway, it's a kind
of specialty dessert.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,360
People only eat it on their birthdays.

152
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,120
Like longevity peaches?

153
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,960
You could say that.

154
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,910
And before eating it,

155
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,270
you have to light candles
and sing a birthday song.

156
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,080
The birthday person can make a wish
before the candles.

157
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,750
That sounds rather interesting.

158
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,120
So, you want to make a birthday cake
for the empress dowager?

159
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,870
Exactly. Like the longevity peaches,

160
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,750
it's a sincere wish
for the birthday person's well-being.

161
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,630
When the birthday person makes a wish,

162
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,840
it symbolizes their hopes
and dreams for the future.

163
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,150
Don't be fooled by its odd appearance.

164
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,550
It carries deep care
for the birthday person.

165
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,200
Receiving it always brings joy.

166
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,870
My birthday and hers
are just one day apart.

167
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,720
I've never properly
celebrated my birthday.

168
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,720
Gifts are a rare thing.
