It's flowing continuously.

You're so delicate.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
Why is the pain

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,560
like a knife cutting through?

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,760
It's normal.

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,030
You'll get used to it.

What did you say?

00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,800
Nothing.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,090
It's getting dark.

20
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,030
Dear, get some rest.

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,000
Do you feel this way every month?

22
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,880
Yes.

I'll share my bed later.

I've long heard you guys
are affectionate.

71
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,430
Your father admired the late empress,

72
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,680
but he couldn't express it
for the emperor's sake.

73
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,220
(Spirit Tablet of Shuwan)

74
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,070
The late princess's maiden name

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,390
wasn't Shuwan.

76
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
So, she is...

77
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,030
You can leave now.

78
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,710
Miss,

79
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,360
the princess is having her period

80
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,320
and is unwell.

81
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,510
The prince has instructed her to rest,

82
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,800
so she got up late.

83
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,190
Please don't blame her.

84
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,310
The princess can't bear any punishment.

85
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,870
Are you using the prince to threaten me?

86
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,360
The prince and I are in harmony.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,390
Our cousin is reasonable.

88
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,120
She surely won't blame me.

89
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,880
You can leave now.

90
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,510
I thought you had
restrained yourself lately,

91
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,310
but it seems you're still unruly.

92
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,920
What was I like before?

93
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,950
Not following rules.

94
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,830
Reckless and willful.

95
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,120
Sharp-tongued.

96
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,390
You were not like a princess at all.

97
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,630
(So, she used
to be like this at home too.)

98
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,600
(It seems it's her temperament.)

99
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,390
It used to be only you and...

100
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,920
the prince.

101
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,240
With me here,

102
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,160
it's much livelier.

103
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,120
But it will trouble you.

104
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,240
I don't like you.

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,870
I'm just straightforward.

106
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,070
It takes time...

107
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,190
But I envy you.

108
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,600
Qianyu enlightened me.

109
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,270
All along,

110
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,000
I've wanted to train you
to be a qualified princess

111
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,920
and Qianyu's virtuous wife.

112
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,600
But in reality,
I'm the only one who cares

113
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,310
about this.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,390
What you've done over the years,

115
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,430
Qianyu remembers.

116
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,680
Actually, I envy your recklessness.

117
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,000
You're so free.

118
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,120
Qianyu is right.

119
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,750
I should also have my own life.

120
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,400
He...

121
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,680
What did he tell you?

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,840
Qianyu.

123
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,360
What brings you here?

124
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,630
I know you're busy,

125
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,160
but you can't starve yourself.

126
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,360
I made some soup for you.

127
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,710
Please eat a bit.

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,840
Thank you.

129
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,370
Why are you being distant

130
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,040
this time after coming back?

131
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,080
Am I?

132
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,800
I heard you've been getting close
to the maids lately.

133
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,720
You're not young anymore,

134
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,510
yet you have only the princess.

135
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,360
I know you don't like this,

136
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,480
but you should think about kids.

137
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,870
You always criticize me,

138
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,240
but you're so amiable to Su Qianyu.

139
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,190
Such a phony.

140
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,390
Actually,

141
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,070
I think Qi Xuan is quite good.

142
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,480
Since you returned,

143
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,920
she has indeed restrained herself a lot.

144
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,360
But a woman running around all the time

145
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,310
is also inappropriate.

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,840
Sister,

147
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,000
have you considered traveling the world?

148
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,830
The outside world is very exciting.

149
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,630
You shouldn't limit yourself
to this small place.

150
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,510
Though this mansion
occupies a large area,

151
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,360
you should go out more

152
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,520
to broaden your horizons.

153
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,920
Sister,

154
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,790
did I say something wrong?

155
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,110
It's fine.

156
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,320
I'll head back first.

157
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,670
(I didn't expect her
to be so considerate.)

158
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,550
I overlooked that.

159
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,910
Not your fualt.

160
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,840
It's my own decision.

161
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,000
Just get along with Qianyu.

162
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,440
Don't let me fail the late princess.

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,390
