=Episode 9=

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,640
You're an esteemed prince

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,280
with royal blood.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,160
Engaging in such sordid affairs

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,920
as eavesdropping

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,000
could surely bring disgrace.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,110
(What nonsense is this?)

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,280
(You dare to act yet fear being seen?)

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,200
Overthinking

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,670
has led me astray.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,920
Consort Xian, please forgive me.

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,640
Astray?

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,750
Since you're here,

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,600
have a cup of tea before leaving.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,040
Yes.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,310
You've helped the emperor
greatly in court.

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,040
Today, let me express our gratitude
on behalf of His Majesty.

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,910
Sounds good.

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,350
Here, have some tea.

24
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,040
What do you think?

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,760
This is fine Mingqian Longjing tea.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,120
I hope it suits your palate.

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,950
(Based on the experience
in palace dramas,)

28
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,840
(is she trying to win me over
because I stumbled upon her affair)

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,200
(with that actor?)

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Thanks for your kindness.

31
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,560
Time flies.

32
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,310
In the blink of an eye,

33
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,430
everything changes.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,480
But you've truly aged gracefully.

35
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,710
You're still so pretty.

36
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,480
Oh, come on.

37
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,840
When did you learn
to be so smooth-tongued?

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,910
My work habits acted up again;
what am I rambling on about?

39
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,470
Would Su Qianyu praise someone this way?

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,710
Aged gracefully?

41
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,680
Today I have urgent matters,

42
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,870
so I can't enjoy the show with you.

43
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,630
I'll take my leave.

44
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,360
I think Su Qianyu's identity
is not simple.

45
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,710
What do you mean, Mother?

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,000
Have you heard?

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,800
There is an unclaimed tablet
in his mansion.

48
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,280
Rumors say that the mansion

49
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,030
is filled with portraits
of beautiful women.

50
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,870
These days in the palace,

51
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,560
he's been visiting departments,

52
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,800
inquiring if there are indeed portraits
of beautiful women.

53
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,800
Even more intriguing.

54
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,520
How?

55
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,840
Do you know that this painting
concerns the late empress?

56
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,310
What?

57
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,960
You mean his inquiries

58
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
are related to the late empress?

59
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,680
Then the late prince...

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,960
Indeed.

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,280
When that wretched woman
was in the palace,

62
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,360
the late prince's gaze towards her
was hardly innocent.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,240
She gave birth to First Prince,

64
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,470
and they avoided seeing each other,

65
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,840
but there were always rumors

66
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,400
the late prince refused to marry
for her multiple times.

67
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,870
Even after marrying his wife,
he neglected her at home.

68
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,870
So,

69
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,800
Su Qianyu's background is suspicious.

70
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,360
I heard that he was brought back
from the border.

71
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,630
It's said he was
the late prince's lost heir.

72
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,520
He was five years old
when he was brought back.

73
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,840
He's of a similar age to Forth Prince.

74
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,080
Shuwan and First Prince
died in the palace long ago.

75
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,360
That fire burned all night.

76
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,680
No one survived in Fengyi Palace.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
Could it be

78
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,240
First Prince didn't die?

79
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,240
It's possible.

80
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,280
Father can't know this.

81
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,000
Not even a hint of suspicion.

82
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Mother, don't be anxious.

83
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,000
I will investigate.

84
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,120
I want to see

85
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,270
what Su Qianyu is up to.

86
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,000
You're the one who deserves to die.

87
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,760
Who?

88
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,680
Who is it?

89
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,590
Who?

90
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,750
Who's talking? Show yourself.

91
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,360
Su Qianyu?

92
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,310
Why did you harm me?

93
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,800
You're the one who should've been dead.

94
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,470
No!

95
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
Had a nightmare?

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,030
What kind of creepy habit
is watching me sleep?

97
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,510
What did you do in the palace?
Who did you meet?

98
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,710
(Oh, no.)

99
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,120
(Did my compliment of Consort Xian
get me into trouble?)

100
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,970
I...

101
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,560
I just attended court as usual.

102
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,560
Consort Xian sent an invitation,

103
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,170
asking you to the palace tomorrow
at noon to enjoy the show.

104
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,270
Oh, no.

105
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,320
What?

106
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,510
Nothing, just an exclamation.

107
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,920
Answer my question.

108
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,600
If I tell him I almost got exposed
in front of Consort Xian,

109
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,510
that dagger from my dream
might really end up in me.

110
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,240
Based on Su Qianyu's personality,

111
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,950
it wouldn't be surprising

112
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,580
if he used my body to harm himself.

113
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,310
It's just a normal social event
in the palace.

114
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,680
I'll be careful when I go.

115
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,510
You're no match for that woman.

116
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,430
Find an excuse to turn her down.

117
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,950
- But...
-There's no but.

118
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,040
(Now, refusing might make me
seem even more guilty.)

119
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,600
(I can't listen to you.)

120
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,510
(Even if it's a trap,)

121
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,630
(I've got to bite the bullet and go.)

122
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,750
Prince Su, please enjoy the tea.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,840
Here.

124
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,360
Thank you for the invitation.

125
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,630
I wonder if the singer in this room
is the famous actor Cheng Ying.

126
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,240
You heard wrong.

127
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,720
The one singing is the actor Qin Shuang.

128
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,930
I heard the best performance
of The West Chamber was by Cheng Ying.

129
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,560
I didn't expect there to be another
who caught your eye.

130
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,070
It seems that you have

131
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,270
quite an understanding of opera.

132
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,160
Not at all.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,840
Well.

134
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,670
I only heard of it.

135
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,430
First Prince is allergic to mangoes;
that's one thing.

136
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,430
If he truly is Fourth Prince,

137
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,510
the portrait of the late empress
could serve as bait.

138
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,070
We can test him.

139
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,720
This morning, Father summoned me

140
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,070
and said the annual Book Drying Festival
in the palace was approaching,

141
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,920
but he hadn't decided on the person
to handle this event.

142
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,360
Book Drying Festival?

143
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,600
It seems you've forgotten
many old palace customs

144
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,800
after years of fighting on the border.

145
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,830
As the name suggests,

146
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,430
the festival involves

147
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,720
airing out all the books, paintings,
and documents in the palace

148
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,070
to avoid insect damage and mold.

149
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,430
I know.

150
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,070
The emperor is wise.

151
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,720
All the paintings?

152
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,560
Does that mean I have a chance
to find that portrait?

153
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,720
Thank you for the invitation,

154
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,200
but I have things to do,

155
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,230
so I must leave now.

156
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,120
He ate a mango

157
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,030
and was completely fine.

158
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,510
It can't be that dramatic, right?

159
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,320
Was I poisoned?

160
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,840
Why hasn't he come out yet?

161
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,480
I remember

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,960
when Fourth Prince
mistakenly bit a mango,

163
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,040
he collapsed immediately,
burning with fever and convulsions,

164
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,360
nearly losing his life.

165
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,360
Could it be that we guessed wrong?

166
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
In any case,

167
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,650
better to kill by mistake

168
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,200
than to let him go.

169
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,840
Can't you save me some worries?

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,030
Didn't I tell you not...

171
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,200
Keep it quiet.

172
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,600
Tell them the prince got tired
in the palace

173
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,010
- and has fallen asleep.
- Yes.

174
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,920
I'll go drive.

175
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,600
I won't die, will I?

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,240
Don't worry. I won't let you die.

177
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,910
Mom.

178
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,960
Why are you crying all day?
Why don't you just go die?

179
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,480
You drink every day; why don't you...

180
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,510
Do I need you to tell me what to do?

181
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,120
Still crying?

182
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,870
I've had nothing but bad luck

183
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,000
supporting you useless things.

184
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,480
Mom.

185
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,510
Open the door.

186
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,960
Let me in.

187
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,630
Open the door.

188
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,360
If it weren't for you crying,
your mother wouldn't have died.

189
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,680
Open the door.

190
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,150
Still wailing?

191
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Are you trying to kill me too?

192
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,910
Come out.

193
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,390
You should die
with that unlucky mother of yours.

194
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,080
You little brat,
why didn't you die instead?

195
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,000
Come out. Get out here.

196
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,440
It's all because of you
that your mother died.

197
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,800
(Mom.)

198
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,030
