6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,640
You've worked hard for this.

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,100
The empress dowager will like this gift.

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,430
You flatter me.

9
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,920
May Grandmother live long in peace.

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,600
Your Majesty, Empress dowager,
greetings.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,390
Long live the emperor.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,000
Long live the empress dowager.

13
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,030
May the empress dowager
live long in peace.

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,320
May you thrive forever.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,590
Grandmother,

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,150
this is my new concubine,

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,440
Yue Yunwan.

18
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,380
We've prepared
a birthday gift for you.

19
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,870
We hope you'll like it.

20
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,560
What exquisite embroidery!

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,880
Yes, indeed.

22
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,840
It's like the brushwork flows
with life and elegance.

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
It looks

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,310
somewhat similar
to the flower and bird painting

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,120
the empress dowager made back then.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,040
Indeed.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,330
Master Lin has great insight.

28
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not as gifted

29
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,150
as the empress dowager was back then.

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,230
You're too modest.

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,310
With such exquisite thoughts,

32
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,200
I was far behind at your age.

33
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,230
Mother, in your youth,

34
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,640
you were a renowned talent
in the imperial city.

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,230
Why should you be humble?

36
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,270
I am dull-witted,

37
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,160
not as adept as Qianyu in discerning
the emperor's intentions.

38
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,910
Yunwan is not as clever as Princess Su.

39
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,800
Our gift surely can't compare
to what they have prepared.

40
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,280
My gift is rather ordinary.

41
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,430
I hope the empress dowager
won't dislike it.

42
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,380
(For longevity)

43
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,620
(For longevity)

44
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,240
What is this?

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
I wish the empress dowager

46
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,360
longevity and celestial blessings.

47
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,800
May your grace be everlasting.

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,360
What is this?

49
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,120
(For longevity)
It looks like a pastry.

50
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,280
How could a pastry look like this?

51
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,840
This is a birthday cake

52
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,310
made by me and Prince Su.

53
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,000
All the ingredients on top are edible.

54
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,400
The longevity peach is made from cream.

55
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,360
It's milk.

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,560
Empress Dowager, Your Majesty,
please taste it.

57
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,710
Why do you have so many wonderful ideas?

58
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,750
The first slice

59
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,750
must be cut by the birthday person.

60
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,260
(For longevity)

61
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,680
This character for longevity
must also be eaten.

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
What's this?

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
Princess Su,

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,360
how dare you offend the empress dowager?

65
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,240
Today is her birthday,

66
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,840
and you sent such a gift.

67
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,190
This signifies a river of blood.

68
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
What do you mean by this?

69
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,390
(It's just a bursting cake.)

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,870
Actually,

71
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,720
I did it on purpose.

72
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,720
You did it on purpose?

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
What does that mean?

74
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,790
Empress Dowager,

75
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,720
this is a kind of cakes.

76
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,720
It's a bursting cake.

77
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,750
Actually, the jam inside

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,430
is made from fresh flowers and fruits.

79
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,000
I discovered a flower called rose.

80
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,630
Once processed, they become edible.

81
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,310
The key point is the language of roses.

82
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,710
What does that mean?

83
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,800
Roses represent passion,
fervor, and vitality.

84
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,630
In fact,
what Consort Xian said isn't wrong.

85
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,430
The red indeed represents blood,

86
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,160
but blood also symbolizes vitality.

87
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,070
I only wish to convey these
beautiful wishes to the empress dowager.

88
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,630
May the empress dowager
live long in peace.

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,310
May the empress dowager
live long in peace.

90
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,270
Please sit down.

91
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,680
Empress Dowager, please have a taste.

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,200
Alright.

93
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,560
It's really delicious.

94
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,120
I've never had anything so tasty before.

95
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,800
Prince Su really put in a lot of effort.

96
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,510
You all have been thoughtful today.

97
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,080
Empress Dowager!

98
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,640
Mother!

99
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,440
Useless!

100
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,430
You can't even identify the poison

101
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,600
that the empress dowager
is suffering from.

102
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,520
What use is there

103
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,680
in keeping you around?

104
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,560
Your Majesty.

105
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,120
I have practiced medicine for years

106
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,240
and have never seen
such a bizarre poison.

107
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,120
The empress dowager can't wake up,
but her life isn't in danger.

108
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,230
Get out!

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,840
Your Majesty.

110
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,270
Princess Su,

111
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,950
what exactly do you want?

112
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,690
I...

113
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,360
The priority now is
to save Grandmother.

114
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,310
Since we know
that the poison is in the cake,

115
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,120
we should ask the culprit

116
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,720
for the antidote.

117
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,230
It wasn't me.

118
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,560
I didn't do it!

119
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,630
Crown Prince, be cautious.

120
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,270
To conclude this based solely
on a blackened silver needle

121
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,270
is rather childish.

122
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,630
Don't be so quick to absolve yourself.

123
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,630
The empress dowager tasted
the longevity character on this cake

124
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,240
at the request of the Princess Su.

125
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,750
Coincidentally,

126
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,040
this silver needle changed color
on that part of the ingredients.

127
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,240
But this chatacter

128
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,000
is traditionally reserved
for the birthday person.

129
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,120
Moreover, we made this cake personally,

130
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,360
so how could it be poisonous?

131
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,040
Princess Su went to great lengths
to please the empress dowager.

132
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,510
You must want something.

133
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,160
If that's true,

134
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,750
wouldn't poisoning her
be digging my own grave?

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,830
Maybe you saw someone
trying even harder than you,

136
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,160
so you decided to go for the worst.

137
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,360
Su Qianyu.

138
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
We made this cake together.

139
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,440
Since you suspect her,

140
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,200
no point in saying more.

141
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,840
I will stand as witness

142
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,970
and protect her with my life.
