00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,440
Don't be fooled by its odd appearance.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,800
It carries deep care
for the birthday person.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,480
Receiving it always brings joy.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,640
My birthday and hers
are just one day apart.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,430
I've never properly
celebrated my birthday.

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,710
To me, gifts are a rare thing.

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,520
As expected, you're not one
to bother with trivial matters.

13
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,320
Your Highness, Ms. Yue is here.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,620
(Mansion of Prince Su)

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,100
Sister, why not come in?

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,200
I'll wait for someone to announce me.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,560
This will always be your home.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,870
How are things in the Eastern Palace?

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,870
Everything there is managed daily.

20
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,780
I'm living in harmony
with the Crown Prince.

21
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,760
My life is peaceful.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,310
I'm here to talk to you
about the princess.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,840
The princess?

24
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,990
What does she want with the princess?

25
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,840
It doesn't matter.

26
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,550
If you ask me,

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,950
you should remind the princess

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,710
that the prince's birthday is coming.

29
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,000
Ms. Yue used to prepare
longevity noodles for him.

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,760
I'll go right away.

31
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,070
Princess.

32
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,990
Princess.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,760
I heard the prince
and the empress dowager's birthdays

34
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,150
are only a day apart.

35
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,910
I know that.

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,230
You should be more mindful.

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,870
Ms. Yue has returned.

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,310
I heard she said something
to the prince about you.

39
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,400
I was too far away to hear it,

40
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,400
but with my years of experience,
it's not good.

41
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,190
Yue Yunwan isn't that kind of person.

42
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,430
Aren't you curious

43
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,240
about what they were saying
behind your back?

44
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,220
(Full of Fortune)

45
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,080
Divorce?

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,240
I don't know what I did wrong.

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,080
Why do you want him to divorce me?

48
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
- Qi...
- Shut up.

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,250
What kind of wife talks
to her husband like this?

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,680
Before marriage,
Miss Qi was gentle and virtuous.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,520
You're nothing like her.

52
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,150
Gentle and virtuous?

53
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,150
That's for outsiders to see.

54
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,750
How I get along with the prince

55
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,630
is between us as husband and wife.

56
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,430
The prince doesn't care,

57
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,740
yet you're asking him to divorce me.

58
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,710
Isn't that a bit meddlesome?

59
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,000
Sister, forgive her.

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
Xuan is just spoiled by me.

61
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,910
She meant no offense.

62
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,310
I forgot that I'm an outsider now.

63
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,150
But as for Qi Xuan's odd behaviors,

64
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,230
I don't believe
you haven't noticed anything.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,910
I just hope she won't hurt you
in the end.

66
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,150
Don't mind this.

67
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,120
Why should I mind?

68
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,800
You two grew up together as a family.

69
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,990
What am I?

70
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,620
I'm just an outsider who will hurt you.

71
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,900
(Mansion of Prince Su)

72
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,560
Did you find out anything?

73
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,630
I bribed their servants.

74
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,240
They said the princess
had been working

75
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,470
on a birthday cake.

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,750
Birthday cake?

77
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,960
I've got the juice for decoration

78
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,520
and the tools
for whipping the egg whites.

79
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,840
But I heard the milk

80
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,630
is only available in the nearby Yecheng.

81
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,270
With the journey back and forth
and the weather conditions,

82
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,270
it'll likely have spoiled
when it gets here.

83
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,630
I have an old friend

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,750
who owns
vast farmlands and livestock.

85
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,600
That should solve your problem.

86
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,320
As the prince...

87
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,830
I apologize on behalf of Sister.

88
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,510
You're not wrong.
How could the prince be wrong?

89
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,480
It's all my fault.

90
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,040
All of it is my fault.

91
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,270
Give me a chance.

92
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,520
Well then.

93
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,190
We'll see how you do.

94
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,560
Is your friend reliable?

95
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,630
Has Mr. Fu encountered some difficulty?

96
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,830
Do you think it's inappropriate
to ask for a favor

97
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,160
at a time like this?

98
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,670
Good point.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,070
Let's ask him what happened

100
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,520
and decide later.

101
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,950
Mr. Fu, what's worrying you?

102
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,480
Feel free to share with us,

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,310
so we can help brainstorm a solution.

104
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,480
This month,
I was supposed to marry Miss Tang,

105
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,240
the daughter of the pastry mogul.

106
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,360
But she wants to call it off now.

107
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,270
Call it off?

108
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,480
Why is that?

109
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,460
I don't know.

110
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
She's been unhappy lately

111
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,500
and has a short temper.

112
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,490
She keeps asking me
these strange questions,

113
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,950
like what if she argues with my mom
after she marries me?

114
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,190
Or what if the servants

115
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,680
don't recognize her as the mistress?

116
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,950
That day, I got annoyed with it,
so I said something.

117
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,250
So, she wants to call it off.

118
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,150
What did you say?

119
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,110
I forgot.

120
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,870
It was just a normal comment.

121
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,630
When a woman wants to get angry,
everything you do is wrong.

122
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,600
You men always try

123
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,800
to absolve yourselves when issues arise.

124
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,040
She can't be calling it off
without reason.

125
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,680
If you ask me,
why not hear what Miss Tang has to say?

126
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,390
I don't know why,

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,430
but the closer the wedding day gets,
the more restless I feel.

128
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,240
I don't know what my life
will be like after we marry.

129
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,560
That day, I went with him
to see our new house.

130
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,240
I said, "This will be our home
for the rest of our lives."

131
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,040
But he said, "That's my home."

132
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,920
I was so disappointed.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,390
We're about to get married,

134
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,040
but he still treats me as an outsider.

135
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,920
Miss Tang, forgive me for being blunt.

136
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,880
Fu Yun is honest
and straightforward by nature.

137
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,050
He's not the ungrateful person
you're describing.

138
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,160
He probably said that without thinking.

139
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,560
Your Highness, no need to persuade me.

140
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,360
I've seen things clearly.

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,510
Life is

142
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,430
like water held in your hand.

143
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,750
Things like kindness and affection

144
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
all slip away.

145
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,680
Nothing lasts forever.

146
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,240
In the end,

147
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,360
he and I just can't escape fate.

148
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,950
Worrying about things
that haven't even happened to the point

149
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,160
of becoming overly sensitive.

150
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,830
The ancients were not wrong.

151
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,790
Nonsense!

152
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,040
Why don't men ever reflect
on their own actions

153
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,360
before accusing women
of being too sensitive?

154
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,680
Why can't you
be more mindful of your words?

155
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,390
That's not what I meant.

156
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,800
Marrying her would be
the greatest blessing of my life.

157
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,750
Wonton!

158
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,160
Why would she misunderstand me?

159
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,000
Then I leave it in your hands.

160
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,680
If this works out,
I will repay you generously.

161
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,880
There is a small favor
I need your help with.

162
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,950
Once Miss Tang is appeased, we can talk.

163
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,720
- Su Qianyu.
- Sure.

164
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,840
What do you think? Looks nice, right?

165
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,510
I've arranged
to meet Miss Tang here tonight.

166
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,510
When the time comes,

167
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,670
you'll give all these things to her.

168
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,390
May I ask

169
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,360
why my apology

170
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,360
needs my entire fortune as a gift?

171
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,710
You blockhead!

172
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,060
(Hold your hand and grow old together)

173
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,920
How about this?

174
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,360
These are for your confession.

175
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,630
Inside these sachets,

176
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,670
some contain property deeds.

177
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,440
Some contain money.

178
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,910
She's afraid you'll treat her
as an outsider,

179
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,120
so you should tell her

180
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,320
she'll always be the mistress at home.

181
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,870
Thank you for your righteous help.

182
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,630
Don't mention it.

183
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,510
