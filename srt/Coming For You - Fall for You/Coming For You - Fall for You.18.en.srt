=Episode 18=

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,230
Qi Xuan, you finally came out.

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,810
Have they made it hard for you?

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,120
With me around,

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,710
who would dare to do that?

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,390
I hope it's as you said.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,520
If I can't protect her,

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,840
then no one in the world can.

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,560
Oh, enough.

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,430
The cause of the poisoning is unknown.

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,600
If you two really have energy to spare,

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,030
go help me investigate leads

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,560
and throw back the blame
others have given me.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,080
- Fine.
- Fine.

19
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,520
The ingredients are clear.

20
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,920
I personally made this icing.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,230
It shouldn't have any issues.

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,560
But the silver needle did change color.

23
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,790
What could be the reason?

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,000
Have you ever thought

25
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,920
that what changed the color
wasn't the ingredients?

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,110
Maybe someone poisoned it in the palace.

27
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,920
But Su Qianyu didn't...

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,320
I'm fine.

29
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,150
But the empress dowager did faint.

30
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,560
Who is so intent on framing me,

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,000
poisoning here?

32
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,230
Today, the Crown Prince
and Ms. Yue were targeting you two.

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,440
It's not the person but the treasure

34
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,010
you possess that brings you trouble.

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,380
(Full of Fortune)

36
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,030
Su Qianyu!

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,120
Su Qianyu!

38
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
I'll go chase.

39
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,870
Are you okay?

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,630
Someone come!

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,870
Luoyun!

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,000
Nai!

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,630
Hurry, someone!

44
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,430
Someone come!

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
Su Qianyu!

46
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,840
Su Qianyu!

47
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,470
(Did the man in black
deliberately lead me here?)

48
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,470
(The Crown Prince is the main suspect,)

49
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,720
(but this doesn't seem like his style.)

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,470
(Unless the one
giving the orders isn't him.)

51
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,560
How cautious of you,

52
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,470
using the empress dowager
to divert their attention.

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,960
They think it's a frame-up,

54
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,840
but they don't know

55
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,030
my target
has always been Su Qianyu.

56
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,430
After this,

57
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,000
Su Qianyu will likely be
in great danger.

58
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,240
Since we are to act,
we must plan meticulously.

59
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,310
Su Qianyu was poisoned,

60
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,720
but I can only rest easy

61
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,700
once I see the poison act up.

62
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,680
What if anything goes wrong?

63
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,360
That'd be a pity.

64
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,350
Mother!

65
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,270
Empress Dowager!

66
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,800
I understand Su Qianyu.

67
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,120
Once Qi Xuan was accused
of poisoning the cake,

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,270
he would certainly prove her innocence

69
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,240
by eating the poisoned cake.

70
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,830
Qi Xuan is indeed his Achilles' heel.

71
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,000
He inhaled the drug added
to the incense burner that day,

72
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,390
so, the man in black
was sent to provoke him.

73
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,430
The poison surely has acted up.

74
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,430
They should never have suspected

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,140
that the empress dowager's slumber
was a diversion.

76
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,190
The one we truly want to poison

77
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,640
is him.

78
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,590
Prince Su called you "Sister"
for over a decade.

79
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,830
You really are heartless.

80
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,630
My life has long
been returned to his family.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,560
I'll make sure to avenge my family

82
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,040
for the wrongs done sooner or later.

83
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,110
That's not enough.

84
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,680
I will seize

85
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,920
whatever they want.

86
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,070
The emperor has ordered.

87
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,070
Princess Su poisoned
the empress dowager and Prince Su.

88
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,680
She is to be arrested immediately.

89
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,120
I never expected

90
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,040
to see you here.

91
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
Princess.

92
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,360
How can you help the Crown Prince?

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,480
Su Qianyu always regards you
as a true sister.

94
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,430
Regards me as a true sister?

95
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,160
I was once my parents' cherished jewel.

96
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,630
I had parents and a younger brother.

97
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,390
If it weren't for the late prince,

98
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,360
how could I end up relying on others?

99
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,720
The late prince ruined my family

100
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,950
and adopted me out of guilt.

101
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,000
Should I be grateful for this?

102
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,070
You hate the late prince?

103
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,270
Does Su Qianyu know about this?

104
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,920
What if he knows?

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,240
What if he doesn't?

106
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,950
In any case, my family's lives
need to be repaid in blood.

107
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,240
Regardless of whether
there's any truth to it,

108
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,950
he was just a child back then.

109
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,040
Why does it concern him or me?

110
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,200
Why does it concern him?

111
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,870
If my family hadn't taken the blame,

112
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,920
would his family have the glory today?

113
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,920
Everything he enjoys

114
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,720
was built on the lives
of hundreds of my family.

115
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Am I wrong to seek revenge against him?

116
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,680
This is your goal.

117
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,070
You used me to drag Su Qianyu down

118
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,830
to kill him.

119
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,680
At least I'm more merciful than you,

120
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,850
allowing you to die knowing the truth.

121
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,870
Is this the result you want?

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,240
I just wanted you to suffer
from losing everything in an instant.

123
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:36,950
The painting you want will be ruined.
That's just a start.

124
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,000
Is this the result you want?

125
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,920
The result I want?

126
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,360
Even if you lose everything,

127
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,270
what I want

128
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,430
won't come back.

129
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,720
(What does she mean by that?)

130
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,830
(She's ruined that painting?)

131
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,000
(It's impossible.)

132
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,320
(The painting must still be there.)

133
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,600
(I will definitely go back.)

134
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,510
Tell me. Who sent you?

135
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,440
Take her away.

136
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,370
Yes.

137
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,920
Su Qianyu!

138
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,360
Someone wants to kill me.

139
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,790
Yue Yunwan said
she wanted me to lose everything.

140
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,680
It's okay now.

141
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,720
I won't let anything happen to you.

142
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
She wants my life.

143
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,750
Su Qianyu.

144
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,630
I...

145
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,510
I want to leave. Take me home.

146
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,360
I've dragged you down.

147
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,080
- I'm sorry.
- I want to leave here.

148
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,600
Take me away from here.

149
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,630
Soon.

150
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll take you away soon.
