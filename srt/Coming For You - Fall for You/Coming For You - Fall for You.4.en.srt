00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,630
This is my homemade ice jelly.

79

with raisins and crushed peanuts on top.

80

Inside there's brown sugar and fruits.

81
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,440
All are chilled.

82

What do you want to ask me?

86
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,360
Today, a maid said you'd changed.

87
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,310
No, I've changed.

88
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,000
Anyway, they noticed it.

89
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,120

90
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,510
Punish her immediately.

91
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,920
That's not the point.

92
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,750
The point is they can all see it.

93
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,870
If this gets out,

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,120
will we be exposed?

95
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Will they think
I'm a monster and kill me?

96
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,870
You have to teach me
how to act like you usually do.

97
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,920
Don't worry.

98
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,510

99
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,070

If anything happens to this body,

101
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,160
it's your body.

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,800

103

No one can touch it easily.

104
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,560
In this body of mine,

105
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,310
you can freely do what you want.

106
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,910
I'll handle

107
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,000
everything for you.

108
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,800
Since you say I can do whatever I want,

109
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
I now command you

110
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,760
to drink it.

111
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,480

I'm used to facing everything alone.)

112

someone's cared about me.)

113

The patient is out of danger,

116
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,940
but before the rescue,

117
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,030
(In Operation)
her heartbeat has stopped.

118
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,910
We performed prolonged CPR
for over 20 minutes.

119
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,120

It's possible...

123
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,910
I mean there is a possibility

124
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,720
she may become a vegetative state

125
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,870
and never wake up.

126
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,080
