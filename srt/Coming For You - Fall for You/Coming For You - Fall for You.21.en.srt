00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,900
(Eastern Palace)

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,160
What did you say?

8
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,480
Qi Xuan went to find Sang Zhi?

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,720
Yes.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,030
The princess didn't let me follow.

11
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,950
Prince.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,560
Mr. Sang went to meet the Crown Prince.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,840
Mr. Sang.

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,680
You've gone to great lengths
to lure me away.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,200
You're joking.

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,790
The Hanlin Academy does need you.

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,550
I have to go back to the Eastern Palace.

18
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,680
Do you want to come with me?

19
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,680
(The Crown Prince did hide it.)

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,430
Princess Su came here as a guest,

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,710
yet no one informed me.

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,760
I'm unworthy to be your guest.

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,760
It's getting late.

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,920
I won't disturb your rest.

25
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,840
This painting seems to be mine.

26
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,560
What crime do you deserve

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,430
for stealing from here?

28
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
Are you alright?

29
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,610
My princess mistakenly entered here.

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,190
She didn't mean to offend you.

31
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,470
Your Highness,

32
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,910
please show some leniency.

33
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,010
(Striving for Progress)
Princess Su attempted to kill me.

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,590
What crime does she deserve?

35
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,520
If you want to slander me,
at least provide evidence.

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,630
As long as I suffer any harm,

37
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,630
there will be proof
of Prince Su plotting against me.

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,840
Someone will have
to take responsibility.

39
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,560
You want to get rid of me,

40
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,000
but now, it won't be so easy.

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,910
What difficulty is there now?

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,870
About the fire in Fengyi Palace,

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,000
as long as I tell Father what I saw,

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,800
then

45
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,560
your position as Crown Prince...

46
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,800
You...

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,280
Take care, Your Highness.

48
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,310
What?

49
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,750
He saw it?

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,840
He said it himself,

51
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,080
so firmly,

52
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,380
using this to threaten me.

53
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,360
I knew he had ambition,

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,190
just like his wretched mother.

55
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,560
I should've been
more ruthless back then.

56
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,960
That woman couldn't defeat me,

57
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,120
and her son won't surpass mine either.

58
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,000
Why deal with him? The Crown Prince
can be replaced at any time.

59
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,150
Only that position is secure.

60
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,000
Father, you're busy with state affairs,

61
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,870
but you can't ignore your health.

62
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,760
There are no small matters in the court.

63
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,000
Once

64
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,310
you sit in this position,

65
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,930
you must take responsibility
for the country without making mistakes.

66
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,200
Then you must take care of yourself.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,360
Only if you are healthy

68
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,400
can the people

69
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,820
of the world live in peace
and prosperity.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,840
Are you saying...?

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,760
Su Qianyu has led the troops for years

72
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,240
and has had a great influence
on the military.

73
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,800
Qi Xuan is supported by the Grand Tutor
and the Sang family.

74
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,710
They have people, money, and soldiers,

75
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
and now they have leverage over us.

76
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,830
If I can't kill in one strike this time,

77
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,160
I won't need

78
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,870
to be the Crown Prince.

79
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,380
(Yangxin Hall)

80
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,510
What happened to Father?

81
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,820
The royal physicians
are treating him.

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,930
I want to get in to care for him.

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,360
The physicians said
Father needed to rest in peace.

84
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,270
If Father wakes, he will summon you.

85
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,630
To achieve your goal,

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,480
you're truly heartless and ruthless.

87
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,310
I don't know what you're talking about.

88
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,800
Father fainted,
and I'm the Crown Prince.

89
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,150
It is proper for me
to take over palace affairs.

90
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,700
It's you who should restrain yourself.

91
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,480
You're nothing but a subject.

92
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,240
Then I'll leave it to you.

93
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,670
Luoyun.

94
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,950
Summon Master Qi, Sang Zhi
and the officer of the imperial guards.

95
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,270
The result depends on this.

96
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,310
Crown Prince, everything is arranged.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,390
Prince Su will walk into the trap.

98
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,310
I didn't know when the Crown Prince

99
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,510
started engaging
in extortion and kidnapping.

100
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,800
Send a message to Su Qianyu.

101
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,920
Tell him that Princess Su

102
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,870
is imprisoned in an abandoned temple
outside the city.

103
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,230
Yes.

104
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,510
I thought you were at least a man,

105
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,430
yet you resort to despicable means

106
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,800
when you can't beat your opponent.

107
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,270
Do you think using me
to threaten Su Qianyu

108
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,560
will make him yield?

109
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,830
You know better than I do
what kind of person he is.

110
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,200
I'm telling you.

111
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,800
Even if I die here tonight,

112
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,630
I won't let you succeed.

113
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,680
It's because I know him so well

114
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,760
that having you here
makes it interesting.

115
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,790
How about

116
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,680
we make a bet?

117
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,870
He captured Qi Xuan?

118
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,080
Your Highness.

119
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,950
Your Highness,
we must prioritize the greater matter.

120
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,170
Qi Xuan is imprisoned
in an abandoned temple.

121
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,110
Luoyun,

122
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,950
take a team with you.

123
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,560
You must bring her back unharmed.

124
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,510
I will not fail you, Your Highness.

125
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,160
All soldiers,

126
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,190
follow me into the palace!

127
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,520
Yes!

128
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,270
Why are you avoiding me?

129
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,360
You want to leave me.

130
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,400
I'm telling you.

131
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,880
Don't think about it.

132
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,160
You want to leave me.

133
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,460
I forbid you from leaving me.

134
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
I won't allow it!
