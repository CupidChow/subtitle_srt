I'm Qi Xuan,
an ancient painting appraiser.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,750
I got trapped in a dynasty
that history never recorded,

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,950
the Great Yan.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,960
Not only did I accidentally swap bodies,

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,320
but I was caught up
in the struggle for the throne.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,880
An assassin attacked us at night.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,430
After a fierce struggle,

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,200
the prince and I collapsed again
amidst the thunder,

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,920
and we were back to our bodies.

(Eastern Palace)

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,030
The assassin sent to Prince Su failed.
Please forgive us.

20
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,960
Haste makes waste.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,400
Don't worry.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,560

00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,480
Miss.

24
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,200
Where are you rushing off to?

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,400
How about my place?

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,000
Sir, please behave yourself.

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,680
You should be honored that I fancy you.

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,790
Take her.

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,840
What are you doing?

30
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,000
Listen, don't mess with me.

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,150

- Shout?

33

Who said Prince Su neglects his wife?

49
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,590
He clearly dotes on the princess.

50
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,360
That's an outdated rumor
from Wind Pavilion.

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,150
The princess had long clarified
that those rumors were false.

61
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,630

It's a trivial matter.

71
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,630
So what if Father knows?

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,070
I have come today

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,720

I hope you'll grant this.

77
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,030
Impossible.

78
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,230
I'm willing.

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,080

80

Why are you out?

81
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,560
I'm willing to marry.

82
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,190
Qi Xuan, you may not know.

83
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,800
I recently had a close call

84
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,310

85
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,190

I am fond of him.

87
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,240

89
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,800
I will never mistreat her.

90
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,910
Impossible.

Sister, you belong here.

92
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,870
I've known Miss Yue's identity.

93
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,920
Once she marries me,

94
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,510
I'll protect her completely.

95
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,710
Qi Xuan,

96
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,760
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,000
Sister, do you mean it?

98
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,800
My heart is already set.

99
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,360
Didn't you tell me to find my life?

100
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,680
This is my answer.

101
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,430
If this is what you truly wish,

102
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,590
then I

103
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,120
have no reason to stop it.

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,430
Crown Prince, remember what you said.

105
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,720
My sister will always

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,310
have us behind her.

107
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,440
Of course.

108
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,120
Go and fetch the sorted documents
about the Eastern Palace.

109
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,080
Yes.

(Righteousness)
Prince.

111
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,720
Miss Yue has entered the Eastern Palace.

112
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,630
What about our plans?

113
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,270
The plan against them

114
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,270
must be put on hold.

115
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,960
Yes.

116
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,120
Did you hear?
The Crown Prince got a new concubine.

117
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,310
She seems to be of low birth.

118
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,390
I heard she is favored
by the Crown Prince.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I heard that she comes from the Mansion
of Prince Su. Is that true?

120
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,740
(Mansion of Prince Su)
There are rumors flying around

121
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,930
about the concubine.

122
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,160
Don't worry about them.

123
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,750
Did you weave these?

124
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,790
What's this?

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,430
It's called a Chinese knot,

126
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,900
also known as a lover's knot.

127
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,070
It symbolizes

128
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,360
eternal unity.

129
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,430
Then give them all to me.

130
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,070
Exchanging gifts
during the festival is a tradition.

131
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,160
Isn't this a gift for me?

132
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,480
You said it was an exchange.

133
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,480
So, where's mine?

134
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,110
You'll have to wait.

135
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,360
But I'll make sure it's a good one.

136
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,120
No wonder the Crown Prince
always gives you a hard time.

137
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,190
Seeing how proud you are,

138
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,460
even I want to handle you.

139
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,680
But why?

140
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,480
He's already the heir,

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,920
so he shouldn't be threatened by anyone,

142
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,150
especially not a prince like you.

143
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,030
Because I'm not
the late prince's biological son.

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,510
My mother was from Jiangnan

145
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,000
and fell in love with the prince
while he was on a tour.

146
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,030
They got together like this.

147
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,720
Despite objections from my grandfather,

148
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,470
my mother went to the capital
with my father.

149
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,870
It wasn't when she entered
the Fengyi Palace

150
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,150
that my mother realized her husband

151
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,790
was the Crown Prince,

152
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,750
the future emperor.

153
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,240
When my father ascended the throne,

154
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,720
she became his most favored consort.

155
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,000
My mother was favored,

156
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,550
but she was always gentle

157
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,750
and never guarded against others,

158
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,030
especially in the dog-eat-dog palace.

159
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,960
When I was four,

160
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,220
my father went on his usual tour,

161
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,600
and the imperial consorts

162
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,390
seized the opportunity to eliminate her.

163
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,750
Open the door!

164
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,630
Someone!

165
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,750

166
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,080
Is anyone there?

167
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,910

Is anyone there?

170
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,360
So you...

171
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,960
You are...

172

Yes.

173
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,000
