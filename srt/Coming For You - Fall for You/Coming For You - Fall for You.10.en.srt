=Episode 10=

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,260
(Mansion of Prince Su)

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,480
Don't scratch.

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,160
You're being mean.

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,390
I don't want to cause you trouble.

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,520
But trouble keeps finding me.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,030
What can I do?

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,790
That day, I saw her listening to opera.

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,350
I couldn't leave,

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,470
so I had to brush it off with her

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,710
but accidentally said something wrong,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,280
raising her suspicion.

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,840
I was afraid
our identities would be exposed,

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,790
so I had to go as she requested,

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,710
only to be tripped up
by this little mango.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,480
You could've told me the truth.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,590
We can find a way to solve it together.

22
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,000
(Together?)

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,640
(Since I got here,)

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,200
(I've been finding a way to go back,)

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,400
(negotiated with the Great Zhou,)

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,590
(and handled Consort Xian alone.)

27
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,590
(It's the first time I've heard someone
say we could do it together.)

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,760
(But I still have
to go back in the end.)

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,580
You don't blame me
for causing you trouble?

30
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,230
If not for me...

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,350
The ignorant are innocent.

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,280
You don't know many past stories.

33
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,350
But still,

34
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,230
you shouldn't put yourself in danger.

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,510
Consort Xian and Su Qianxu are
more capable than you think.

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,150
You're not their match;
don't be reckless.

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,880
Actually,

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,510
you can rely on me.

39
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,870
I...

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
Can I?

41
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,310
Of course.

42
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,520
(Why is everything he says
so heartwarming?)

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,520
(Qi Xuan, wake up.)

44
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,470
(The cost of being lovesick:)

45
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,180
(at best, ten years of wild herbs;
at worst, dying in the sea.)

46
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,560
(Hurry and wake up.)

47
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,910
You didn't help me when Yue Yunwan
was bullying me before.

48
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,400
Sister is just strict with the rules.

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,030
It's not personal.

50
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,590
Remember the day I just returned?

51
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,910
You were the one who angered Sister,

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,120
yet you came to me feeling wronged,
looking for support.

53
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,800
Let's not talk about that today.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,360
Listen, I discovered something.

55
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,710
The reason I was invited
by Consort Xian to have tea

56
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,910
was that I accidentally witnessed her

57
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,680
being unusually intimate with an actor.

58
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,150
Strangely enough,

59
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,790
during the tea,
she didn't mention the actor at all.

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,520
She just kept watching me eat mangoes,

61
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,190
which made me feel awkward.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,950
Crown Prince mentioned
the Book Drying Festival,

63
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,360
saying that all the books and scrolls
in the palace would be taken out to air.

64
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,240
Book Drying Festival?

65
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,540
(Eastern Palace)

66
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,430
Is this information confirmed?

67
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,800
Yes, these paintings were found
in Prince Su's study.

68
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,150
Upon comparison,

69
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,240
the lady in the painting resembles
the late empress.

70
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,630
The paintings Prince Su copied

71
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,630
are ones the emperor made
for the late empress.

72
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,660
They're her most cherished possessions.

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,470
After she passed away,
the emperor kept them in his study.

74
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,310
Her features do look like Su Qianyu.

75
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,960
Mother also suspected his origins.

76
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,750
If he truly is the late empress's son,

77
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,910
I wouldn't allow such a thing to happen.

78
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:17,940
(Yue Residence)

79
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:43,020
(Yue Residence)

80
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,390
Miss, are you hurt?

81
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,270
Thank you for saving me.

82
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,350
Are you an acquaintance
of the Yue family?

83
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,950
Do you know the owner here?

84
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,420
(Yue Residence)

85
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,780
(Mansion of Prince Su)

86
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,800
After so many days,
your face has finally healed.

87
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,360
Now you know
that being the prince isn't easy.

88
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,120
I just accidentally stepped into a trap.

89
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,150
It's fine.

90
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,310
I'll return eight
or ten traps to them later.

91
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,730
I grew up watching palace dramas.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's that?

93
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,240
Seems to be from the palace.

94
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,000
Where did you get it?

95
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,220
Sang Zhi gave it to me.

96
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,680
Sang Zhi seems to be
a bit too attentive to you.

97
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,310
No, don't get me wrong.

98
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,630
Sang Zhi is like a little brother to me.

99
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,750
You're 19 this year.

100
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,750
Mr. Sang Hanlin is already 20.

101
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,630
You're not even trying
to lie convincingly.

102
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,190
Sang Zhi and I are just friends, really.

103
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,800
If you say that, I might think
you're jealous of Sang Zhi.

104
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,040
Do I need to be?

105
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,410
Don't let me hear the name
of another man from your lips again.

106
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,160
Remember this:

107
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,630
You are mine.

108
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,630
Do you want to join

109
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,630
the Book Drying Festival?

110
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,430
I think it sounds interesting.

111
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,610
I want to join in the fun.

112
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,560
Why are you looking at me?

113
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,480
Are you really
just interested in the fun?

114
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,880
What else?

115
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,390
You're not hiding

116
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,000
something from me again, are you?

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,840
I swear.

118
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,750
I won't cause you any trouble.

119
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,760
I just want to find the portrait
and return to the modern world.

120
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,680
That's unrelated
to causing trouble, right?

121
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,680
It's not deceiving you, right?

122
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,390
Unexpectedly, the past of the Yue family

123
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,120
has led to this.

124
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,480
You're clever to plan this.

125
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,150
Miss,

126
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,680
I contacted
the late master's past subordinate.

127
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,390
The late master was
the scapegoat of Prince Su.

128
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,630
The late prince adopted you
to make amends.

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,460
Are you an acquaintance
of the Yue family?

130
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,000
Do you know the owner here?

131
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,040
(Yue Residence)
The Yue family

132
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,530
is known for their loyalty.

133
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,830
The event back then
involved many things,

134
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,390
but I have always
admired General Yue's character.

135
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,480
I occasionally come to pay my respects.

136
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,390
Involved many things?

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,600
(Father always led his troops wisely.)

138
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,750
(The truth must be
related to the late prince.)

139
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,270
(So, my family
was ruined because of Prince Su.)

140
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,550
I never expected this.

141
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,420
(Yue Residence)

142
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,720
Miss Yue from Prince Su
came to us so quickly.

143
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,390
Our planning was not in vain.

144
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,200
Your Highness, you're far-sighted.

145
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,030
I can make her

146
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,240
my concubine.

147
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,240
Let's not mention the past.

148
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,150
Miss, be careful in the future.

149
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,230
I shall leave now.

150
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,480
May I ask for your name?

151
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,750
I will always remember
your kindness today.

152
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,440
I will repay it in the future.

153
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,390
I am Su Qianxu.

154
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,540
(Tactics to Win the War)

155
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,480
Your Highness, good job today.

156
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,480
You two can develop feelings
step by step

157
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,840
and have a little prince
or little princess.

158
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,480
- (If it's with Qi Xuan,)
- It'll be lively at home.

159
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,720
(that kind of life wouldn't be bad.)

160
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,280
Forget it.

161
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,750
Let's set aside matters of love for now.

162
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,120
Going home is the priority.

163
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,120
Following the plot of novels and movies,

164
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,270
repeat the scene from that time,

165
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,230
and then...

166
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Su Qianyu?

167
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,600
Qianyu, I'm sorry.

168
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,910
You have to live well.

169
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,750
(Mom.)

170
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,200
(Living is really exhausting.)

171
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,790
It's been half a year; the patient
shows no signs of waking up.

172
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,510
We have tried all medical means.

173
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,720
There has been no reaction.

174
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,480
You should be prepared for the worst.

175
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,990
(Qi Xuan.)

176
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,670
(Even you want to leave me?)

177
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,110
(Don't.)

178
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,630
(Don't.)

179
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,200
(I'm really so tired.)

180
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,200
(Don't!)
