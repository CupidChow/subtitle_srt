6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,900
(Mansion of Prince Su)

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,190
You have to teach me
how to act like you usually do.

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,520
In this body of mine,

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,150
you can freely do what you want.

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:36,910
I'll handle

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,000
everything for you.

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,280
(After years on the battlefield,)

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,150
(I'm used to facing everything alone.)

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,070
(It's the first time
someone's cared about me.)

15
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,350
(This must be what Mother meant)

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,670
(by being cared for.)

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,440
I didn't expect you

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,200
to be taken down by a bowl of ice jelly.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,520
Feeling better?

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,150
I had them make you some soup.

21
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,910
Drink it now.

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,510
I can do it myself.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,560
It's very hot; let me feed you.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,840
You'd spill it.

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,560
It's okay.

26
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,920
Being able to drink it
means you'll recover quickly.

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,120
You must take good care of my body.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,760
I want to change back soon.

29
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,680
Are you worried about me

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,230
because you're afraid I'll die

31
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,870
and delay your return?

32
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,790
Not entirely.

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,400
You don't want to remain a woman, right?

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
You should also take good care
of my body.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,640
Speaking of which,

36
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,000
I remembered it.

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,870
When it happened,
it was thunder-storming.

38
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,800
Next time we try,

39
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,630
should we check the weather?

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,750
I've told you so many times.

41
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,470
Don't act like a girl using my body.

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,870
Who wants your body?

43
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,190
If I could switch back, I wouldn't wait.

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,430
Who asked you to go
to the forbidden area?

45
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,750
(Should I tell him why
I'm after the painting?)

46
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,590
(He may know where the painting is.)

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,920
(No.)

48
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,150
(Will he think I'm crazy?)

49
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,750
I...

50
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,680
I think I'm the master of this mansion.

51
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,030
Well.

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,430
The fake master.

53
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,520
I should understand the taboos

54
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,430
and the reasons behind them, right?

55
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,030
Your Highness,

56
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,960
the emperor needs you.

57
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,310
You rest easy; I'll be back soon.

58
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,710
I have many enemies.

59
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,240
There are often dangers.

60
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,590
Let Luoyun protect you by your side

61
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
to take care of you.

62
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

63
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,750
You flirted with a lady,

64
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,190
offending the prince of Great Zhou.

65
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,360
Truly our God of War.

66
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,120
Your power remains
out of the battlefield.

67
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,680
Where did you hear such rumors,
Your Highness?

68
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,280
I live a clean life.
How could I flirt?

69
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,750
It's useless to tell me that.

70
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,000
They've got dirt on you.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,710
If that prince insists on pursuing this,

72
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,680
how will the two countries resolve it?

73
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,270
Great Zhou is testing our bottom line.

74
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,240
I just cut off his delusions to avoid

75
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,400
future troubles.

76
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,310
I hope it really goes as you said.

77
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,720
I shall wait and see.

78
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,000
Your Majesty, listen.

79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,830
What the prince said about his concubine
is a misunderstanding.

80
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,950
I ran into a woman on the street.

81
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,430
She was covered in wounds
and looked terrified.

82
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
I heard she was beaten by her husband.

83
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,680
Out of love for the people,

84
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,560
I cared about it.

85
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,750
I did nothing improper.

86
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,270
Nothing improper?

87
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,510
Who can know for sure?

88
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,830
It is my personal matter
to discipline my concubines.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,070
Why did you need to intervene?

90
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,270
You can't say that.

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Ignorance is no crime.

92
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,920
I didn't know that this lady
was your concubine.

93
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,880
What's wrong

94
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,270
with helping her?

95
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,510
Prince Su admitted to encouraging
my concubine to run away.

96
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,630
He's openly humiliating me.

97
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,920
Please don't be angry.

98
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,310
There's a misunderstanding.

99
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,720
Please let Prince Su explain.

100
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,310
Explain? What is there to explain?

101
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,120
He was wrong and hit a lady.

102
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
You must that brutal husband
who hits her

103
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,190
at every little thing, right?

104
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
Hey.

105
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,750
How could her fragile figure
withstand your strength?

106
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,920
Beating women, are you still a man?

107
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,960
How unreasonable.

108
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,750
You did something wrong first,

109
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,600
yet now you're humiliating me.

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
Your Majesty,

111
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,120
is this how you treat guests
in Great Yan?

112
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
If so,

113
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,630
there's no need to sign
the alliance treaty.

114
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,480
Now, you're giving me a tough problem.

115
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,190
How ridiculous.

116
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,120
I just thought that girl was pitiful
and helped her a bit.

117
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,190
How did I get myself into trouble?

118
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,510
Truly speechless.

119
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,750
I didn't think it through.

120
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,240
I'm willing to bear the consequences.

121
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,350
Is that so?

122
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,950
What do you intend to do?

123
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,750
Lead troops to storm their gates?

124
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,960
That's not possible.

125
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,510
Why is that not possible?

126
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,120
(Nonsense.)

127
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,390
(If I were to fight,)

128
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,560
(I'll be dead before the war starts.)

129
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,070
The war wastes soldiers and resources.

130
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,680
If we can resolve it without bloodshed,

131
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,270
that would be perfect.

132
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,870
That's precisely what I'm worried about.

133
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,750
But how can we do that?

134
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,800
It's very difficult.

135
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,000
I have some connections with Zhou.

136
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,430
If Qianyu is willing,

137
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,600
we can go to persuade the prince to sign

138
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,830
the alliance treaty.

139
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,510
So, what we want is

140
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,390
for the prince to sign
the alliance treaty?

141
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,080
Of course.

142
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,630
To get the client to sign the contract?

143
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,870
I'm familiar with this.

144
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,680
No need to trouble you.

145
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
I will certainly fulfill the mission.
