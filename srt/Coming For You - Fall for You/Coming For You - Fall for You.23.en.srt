What are you saying?

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,880
Isn't what the Crown Prince said true?

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,280
I don't know what he said,

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,280
but believe me.
From beginning to end,

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,800
everything I've done

11
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,150
is not just for my mother,

12

but for you

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,920
and our future.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,840
For us?

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,000
After foolishly being used
and deceived by you,

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,520
you're telling me it was all
for me and our future?

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,560
Do you think I'd still believe you?

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,440
Why not?

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,120
From now on,
there will be no more obstacles.

20
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,870
You can do whatever you want.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,520
Do you believe that?

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,680
Your mother was once
your father's most beloved woman,

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,200
yet she still met a tragic end.

24
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,000
Power struggles in the royal family
are the cruelest.

25
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,200
The throne can turn

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,200
father and son, brother and brother
against each other.

27
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,200
The history books are full of it;
no need to involve me.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
My mind is made up.

29
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,990
Let me go.

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,040
Would you still be able to leave

31
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,590
without that painting?

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,960
Where's the painting?

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,480
Where's the painting?

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,760
Where's the painting?

35
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,070
Why are you doing this to me, Su Qianyu?

36
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,190
Why?

37
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,870
Because I want you here.

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,000
Your drastic change in personality

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,940
is because of the painting, right?

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,880
The first time I saw you
after my return,

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,870
you caused chaos at home.

42
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,560
A person cannot change so drastically,

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,560
unless you are not the real Qi Xuan.

44
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,080
I never asked you,

45
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,960
because I trusted you.

46
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,230
I believed that you'd tell me.
But what about you?

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,250
You've always used divorce
to threaten me.

48
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,030
Su Qianyu.

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,910
I just wanted to have a way out.

50
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,240
Is that wrong?

51
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,190
So why do you blame me
for deceiving you,

52
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,320
when you've been deceiving me too?

53
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,030
Stay by my side.

54
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,680

Your health is important.

What's wrong with the princess?

68
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,590
Nai said the princess
still refused to eat

69
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,430
and barely talked every day.

70
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,130

Qi Xuan would be happy for me.

77
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,240

78
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,420
The princess are different

It's said that in his early years,

138
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,560
the late emperor
hid an imperial edict in it,

139
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,190
naming Prince Su Qianyu as his heir.

(You were the one
looking for the painting.)

158
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,360
(That's why you pushed things along,
going to such lengths,)

(offending the Crown Prince
to get the painting for me.)

160
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,120
(Actually,
there is another way to leave.)

161
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,550
This is antipsychotic medication,

162
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,550
commonly used to treat schizophrenia.

163
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,150

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,960
Antipsychotic medication?

166
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,520
What happens if a normal person
takes it by mistake?

167
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,390
If a normal person takes it,
they may experience mild nausea,

168
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,790
severe dizziness, arrhythmia,

169
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,790
and even cognitive impairment.

170
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,630
Su Qianyu, come home early tonight.

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,470
I'm back.

174
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,600
Why did you lie to me?

175
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,420
I thought this was an opportunity.

176
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,910
An opportunity for us to start over.

177
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,150
I'll just ask you one question.

178
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,240
Please, you must answer me.

179
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,080

180
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,480
Are these drugs

181
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,840
really what I should be taking?

182
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,870
So you...

183
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,670
You've been lying to me all along.

184
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,130
I just didn't want you to leave me.

185
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,790
But can being together solve everything?

186
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,390
Using, deceiving,
and hurting aren't love.

187
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,360
If you lose yourself,

188
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,790
it won't last, don't you see?

189
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,200
So, from beginning to end,

190
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,750
you never understood what love is.

191
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,600
You were just afraid of being abandoned.

192
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,560
No.

193
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,670
It's not like that.

194
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,360
Just stay by my side.

195
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,950
As long as you stay by my side,

196
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,490
everything will get better.

197
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,390
Give me one more chance.

198
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,670
Give me one more chance,
and we can start over.

199
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,230
Okay?

200
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,630
Trust me.

201
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,270
We can start again.

202
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,360
I can't trust you again.
