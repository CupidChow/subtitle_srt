1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,110
Why are you trying to avoid it?

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,480
(Divorce Agreement)
You want to leave me.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,400
I'm telling you.
Don't even think about it.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,320
Even if I die, I'll stay with you.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,720
Can't you speak properly?

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,560
No, I can't.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,840
Even if I die, I'll stay with you.

00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:29,100

(Qi Xuan)

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,520
I'm going to deliver a painting.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,840
Don't act impulsively.

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,240
Let's meet at the usual place
in an hour.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,150
Hey, stop.

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,710
Wait for me.

=Episode 1=

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,120
Who did you say I am?

21
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,280
You are Princess Su here.

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,710
(Mansion of Prince Su)

23
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,790
Princess Su?

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,430
If I'm Princess Su,

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,000
then where is Prince Su?

26
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,710
Prince Su?

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,280
Have you forgotten?

28
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,640
On your wedding night,

29
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,120
(Joy)
he left for Great Zhou's envoys.

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,310
You were left alone
in the bridal chamber.

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
Left alone?

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,120
Oh, no! The princess hanged herself!

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,430
(Wind and Fortune)

34
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,590
Wasn't it that night?

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,480
Your Highness, don't overthink.

36
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,430
It happened after the prince
left the mansion.

37
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,350
But the prince is still a scumbag.

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,200
Your Highness, you...

39
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,510
What are you talking about?

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,790
Royal physician!

41
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,680
The princess seems to have gone mad.

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,070
(Something doesn't feel right.)

43
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,630
What's wrong with me?

44
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,660
(Mansion of Prince Su)

45
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,470
(Like the original Princess Su,)

46
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,400
(my name is also Qi Xuan,)

47
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,080
(but I come from another world.)

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,680
(Maybe it's a parallel world.)

49
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,400
(Or perhaps it's a world in the future.)

50
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,240
(That day, I received
an ancient painting)

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,800
(from the Great Yan Dynasty.)

52
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,470
(It was called Firefly Scroll.)

53
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,520
(And then...)

54
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,840
(I seemed to have met someone.)

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,520
(And after that...)

56
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,360
(I ended up here.)

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,840
(All of this is connected)

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,870
(to that ancient painting
called Firefly Scroll.)

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,750
(I must find it)

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,080
(and return to my world.)

61
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,710
(Mansion of Prince Su)
(OK.)

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,940
(Bedroom)
(Let's go.)

63
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,910
(Storage, Study)
I've asked around.

64
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,590
(Storage)
The painting isn't

65
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,150
in the prince's bedroom,
let alone the study.

66
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,400
Have you checked everywhere?

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,520
I've searched everywhere

68
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,190
except for the rumored forbidden area.

69
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,550
What forbidden area?

70
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,560
(Forbidden)
It's said vital things

71
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,840
(Secluded and Elegant)
are kept there.

72
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,680
No one is allowed
in except for the prince.

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,280
Where is Su Qianyu now?

74
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,430
The palace is hosting a banquet
for the Great Zhou envoys overnight.

75
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,960
The prince won't be back
until tomorrow afternoon.

76
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,590
(Tomorrow afternoon?)

77
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,520
(Great.)

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,800
Why do you keep asking me
to find out where the prince is?

79
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,590
I just miss him.

80
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,910
(Secluded and Elegant)

81
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,750
(Since he's not in the mansion,)

82
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,190
(I can explore the forbidden area.)

83
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,900
(Secluded and Elegant)

84
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,590
Hi.

85
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,430
We meet again.

86
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,940
(Yue Yunwan, Daughter of General Yue)

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,910
(Lucky and Bright)
The late prince ordered.

88
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,400
Everyone must abide by it.

89
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,120
Is there a place in this mansion
where I cannot go?

90
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,510
I will not allow anyone
to challenge the rules.

91
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,040
What gives you the right
to boss me around?

92
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,630
Who is the princess here, you or me?

93
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,190
Guards, take the princess away.

94
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,320
Wait.

95
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,430
You want to lock me up?

96
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,680
Let Su Qianyu come here himself.

97
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,560
The prince has returned.

98
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,920
(That face, that figure.)

99
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,680
(Why does this handsome guy
seem so familiar?)

100
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,440
(Wait.)

101
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,870
(The prince?)

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
(Isn't he my husband?)

103
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,750
(Which means
I don't even need to date...)

104
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,000
Prince.

105
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,310
Someone is bullying
your princess.

106
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,960
Your Highness?

107
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,590
Your Highness!

108
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,480
(Oh, something's wrong.)

109
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,790
(No.)

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,390
(Not the time to be lovestruck.)

111
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,830
Su Qianyu, right?

112
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,430
When did you become so brazen?

113
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,270
I...

114
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
How dare you call me by name?

115
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,750
Since the princess went mad,

116
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,950
she's been acting out.

117
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,390
She entered the forbidden area.

118
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,150
The forbidden area?

119
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,710
I warn you.

120
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,120
You must follow the rules here
since you're here.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,840
Guards.

122
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,680
The princess's maid
has failed in her duty.

123
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,680
Give her twenty strokes with the rod.

124
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,670
Yes.

125
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,040
Wait, we're sorry...

126
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,510
Your Highness,
what's wrong with you today?

127
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,510
What's wrong with me? He started it.

128
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,310
I took the punishment for you today.

129
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,830
Let's just let this go.

130
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,830
But if there's a next time,

131
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,750
I might not make it out alive.

132
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,720
Got it. I'll be more careful next time.

133
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,390
But

134
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,390
why is my relationship
with Su Qianyu so poor?

135
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,870
Why did I marry him?

136
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,600
Quick, tell me.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,120
Your Highness,
your mind is still muddled, isn't it?

138
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,680
You fell in love
with the prince at first sight.

139
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,630
You married him
without a second thought.

140
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,560
Your father had no choice

141
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,870
(Joy)
but to pressure the emperor for this.

142
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,630
But on the wedding night...

143
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,160
What happened that night?

144
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,360
The ceremony's over.

145
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,000
You should rest early.

146
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,110
Prince.

147
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,870
Tonight is our wedding night.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,430
With the imperial decree,

149
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,600
you are now Princess Su.

150
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,270
But I admire you and only wish

151
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,310
for a moment of your affection.

152
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,480
I have no time
for these boring games of love.

153
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,480
If you have to go tonight,

154
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,160
are you trying to force me to death?

155
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,190
You may not know,

156
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,240
but I detest being threatened.

157
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,500
(Wind and Fortune)

158
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,950
Oh, no! The princess hanged herself!

159
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,310
(She was like a completely)

160
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,510
(different person from that night.)

161
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,310
The prince left shortly
after you entered the bridal chamber.

162
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,910
And you just...

163
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,750
Fine. You should rest now.

164
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,000
(Even if it's a forced marriage,)

165
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,120
(his wife hanged herself
on the wedding night.)

166
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,000
(How can he pretend nothing happened?)

167
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,960
(No matter how good-looking he is,
he's still a scumbag.)

168
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,500
(Mansion of Prince Su)

169
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,910
(The painting in the forbidden area
isn't the Firefly Scroll,)

170
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,550
(but it depicts the same beauty.)

171
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,720
(The two paintings must be related.)

172
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,240
(I have to check again.)

173
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,960
(Has it been put away? Where is it?)

174
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,680
What are you after?

175
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,200
I...

176
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,030
I went the wrong way.

177
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,680
Tell me.

178
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,150
Who sent you?

179
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,870
What is your purpose?

180
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,630
I have no purpose. Let me go.

181
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,360
I'll give you one more chance

182
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,800
before I torture you.

183
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,870
No one sent me. Please let me go.

184
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,590
Oh, my.
