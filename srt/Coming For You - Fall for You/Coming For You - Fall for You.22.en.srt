6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,710
Everyone says you two
share a deep and loving bond.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,750
Today, I will test it.

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,520
Let's see if your love
is truly as solid as stone.

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,960
I've told Su Qianyu

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,280
you're at the temple here.

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,280
If he chooses to save you
and gives up the throne,

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,840
I'll let you live in seclusion.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,600
But if you mean nothing to him,

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,470
and he insists on opposing me,

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,300
I'll have no choice but to kill you,

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,520
to sacrifice your blood
to rally the troops.

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,190
How about that?

18
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,280
Do you think this bet is meaningful?

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,640
You killed Su Qianyu's mother

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,280
and rose by stepping on her blood.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,070
If he quit on revenge, he'd be ashamed
to call himself her son.

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,150
How righteous of you, Princess Su.

23
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,280
But what if I told you

24
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,640
Su Qianyu has been using you all along?

25
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,870
Would you still be this resolute?

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,710
Using me?

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
That trick might work on Yue Yunwan,

28
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,400
but not on me.

29
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,920
Su Qianyu married you

30
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,280
for your father's power.

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,310
He told you about the late empress,

32
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,120
step by step using you

33
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,510
to expose his identity to Father.

34
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,230
When the emperor's wrath came,
you'd bear the brunt,

35
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,480
while he'd sit back

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,200
and reap all the benefits.

37
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,200
So cunning.

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,350
Even I pale in comparison.

39
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,590
Nonsense. Did you see him do this?

40
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,640
You're better than the at the tea house.

41
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,870
When you're not the Crown Prince,

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,710
you could always become a storyteller.

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,470
You can write

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
with your pen.

45
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,710
I just know him well.

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,960
To men, power always outweighs women.

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,240
That's just how it is.

48
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,520
Women are always discarded in the end.

49
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,360
The late empress and Yue Yunwan
were discarded.

50
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,560
Do you think Su Qianyu
will be any different?

51
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,120
Status or you.

52
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,150
I'm curious to see
which one Su Qianyu will choose.

53
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,630
It seems

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,750
we'll know the result soon enough.

55
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,750
Do you expect to see him,

56
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,400
or not see him?

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,120
Stop!

58
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,000
Su Qianyu, don't worry about me.

59
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,710
You're so calculating.

60
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,910
A life for a life.

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,470
Prince Su has committed treason

62
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,820
and will kill himself in the grand hall.

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,400
Out of compassion
for Prince Su's years of service,

64
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,800
I'll spare Princess Su's life.

65
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,110
How about that?

66
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,870
You don't actually think

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,800
her life could threaten me

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,950
into giving up the throne, do you?

69
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,920
Once this is over,

70
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,190
I'll have a harem of beauties.

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,800
She'll be sacrificed
for the greater cause,

72
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,880
and I'll ensure

73
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,950
she's honored after her death.

74
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,600
Well said.

75
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,120
You're indeed decisive,

76
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,720
unmoved by trivial sentiments.

77
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,560
Princess Su, how noble of you.

78
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,430
Even when being used,

79
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,480
you still care for him so much.

80
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,070
Do you really not care about her life?

81
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,870
You know I've been using her.

82
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,390
What does a mere pawn's life

83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,040
matter to me?

84
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,070
As for you,

85
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,600
you drugged the emperor,

86
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,830
seized control of the palace,
and committed treason.

87
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,190
My actions are
to purge the court of traitors.

88
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,040
One more thing, Crown Prince.

89
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,680
How do you think I got in here?

90
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,190
All your men have been cut down.

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,510
Surrender now,

92
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,950
and I'll spare your life.

93
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,380
How laughable.

94
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,870
You're the one with ambitions,
coveting the throne,

95
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,160
forcing me into this situation.

96
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,270
Why would I ever surrender to you?

97
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,750
Because of my mother's death.

98
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,240
Since the fire years ago,

99
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,760
this battle between us
has been inevitable.

100
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,870
Let's see

101
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,830
who will win.

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,950
If you surrender now...

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,840
Surrender?

104
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
I've been Crown Prince for 20 years.

105
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,070
How would I ever bow down to anyone?

106
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,310
If I die,

107
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,120
I'll take the woman you love with me.

108
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,950
The emperor has passed away.

109
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,750
The emperor has passed away.

110
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,240
During the mourning period
for the late emperor,

111
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,870
I'll temporarily assume the regency
as Prince Qianyu.

112
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
After the mourning period

113
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,430
of thirty-six days,

114
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,920
I will ascend the throne.

115
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,270
Well...

116
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,270
It seems the minister disagrees?

117
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,630
I wouldn't dare.

118
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I just want to remind Prince Qianyu

119
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,920
that besides the emperor's funeral...

120
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,950
The late empress must rest
with the emperor in the royal tomb.

121
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,750
As for Consort Xian,

122
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,000
she's been found guilty
of plotting against the late empress.

123
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,580
She's been sentenced to die.

124
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,000
Do any of you ministers have objections?

125
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,140
(Diligence and Governance)

126
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,000
If there are no objections,

127
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,680
then...

128
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,440
We have no objections.

129
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:08,580
(Wind and Fortune)

130
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,750
What are you doing?

131
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,680
By the prince's order,

132
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,060
we are to protect you everywhere.

133
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,720
Am I a prisoner?
Why following me everywhere?

134
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,440
Stop following me!

135
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,970
Didn't you hear me?
I said stop following me!

136
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,430
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

137
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,750
Are you planning to imprison me?

138
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,590
Of course not.

139
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,510
A lot has happened recently.

140
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,750
Before my coronation,
I can't let anything go wrong.

141
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,900
Once you enter the palace with me,

142
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,600
you'll have your freedom.

143
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,080
Su Qianyu,

144
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,360
do you even realize
how ridiculous that sounds?

145
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,320
Entering the palace is the beginning
of losing my freedom.

146
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,470
Let's separate.

147
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,120
Why won't you listen to me
and get treatment?

148
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,270
I told you.

149
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
I'm not sick!

150
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,000
Can't you face reality?

151
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,630
Do you think we can still
be happy like this?

152
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,960
You want to leave me, right?

153
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,720
You're hurting me.

154
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,960
You want to leave me.

155
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,000
Why are you avoiding it?

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,030
You want to leave me.

157
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,350
I'm telling you.

158
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,040
Don't think about it.

159
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,510
Even if I die, I'll stay with you.

160
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,790
Can't you speak properly?

161
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,630
No, I can't.

162
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,030
You want to leave me.

163
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,630
I forbid you from leaving me.

164
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,920
I won't allow it!

165
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,840
Xuan,

166
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,780
make sure to take your medicine today.

167
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,630
Is the medicine

168
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,670
fake too?

169
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,480
(Without your memory,)

170
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,440
(you'll never leave me again.)

171
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,600
