to you.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,160
You're so afraid of losing me?

So, if one day

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,470
I suddenly disappear from your world,

I would die.

Don't worry.

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,070
I will always be by your side.

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,330

Why are you giving me this?

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,200
Because the rabbit
is very important to you.

29
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,350
So,

30
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,150
you've had no friends in the palace
since you were young.

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
When I was little,
besides my mother,

32
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,870
there was a wounded rabbit with me.

33
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,400
That rabbit accompanied me
for a long time.

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,070
But one day,
the rabbit disappeared.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,480
There hasn't been anyone
to talk to since.

36
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,200
It seems it has always been this way.

The things I care about

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,430
always can't stay by my side.

Don't worry.

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,590
I will always be by your side.

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,680
Do you like it?

42
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,750

and living a stable life,

47
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,190

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,800
(should I do my best to help him?)

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,800
This is my mother's jade pendant.

54
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,960
Her maiden name was Shuwan.

55
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,240
This is the only thing she left for me.

56
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,280
Now I am giving my most precious thing

57
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,920
to you.

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,970
All these years,
I've indeed made many plans,

59
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
but not to seize power.

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,470
I just want justice for my mother.

61
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,710
But since I met you,

62
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,910
I seem to have become greedier,

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,360
wanting to be with you longer

64
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,000
and live longer.

65
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,400
(You want justice;
I will help you seek it.)

66
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,470
Tell me.

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,840
Where did this jade pendant come from?

68
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,220
The pendant was
a gift from an old friend.

69
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,800
He told me

70
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,680
the story of this pendant.

71
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,590
Your Majesty, are you interested?

72
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,360
Please tell me.

73
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,400
The pendant's owner,

74
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,710
was as gentle

75
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,840
and virtuous as her name,

76
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,960
Shuwan,

77
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,660
but she fell in love with someone
she shouldn't have.

78
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,610
She thought their first encounter

79
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,560
on the bridge was the beginning of love,

80
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,630
but little did she know
it was the start of a tragedy.

81
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,070
They loved each other
and promised to be together for life,

82
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,720
but her husband
didn't even reveal his true identity.

83
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,480
She didn't fight for anything
and focused on her little family,

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,160
but in the end,
she couldn't even save her own life.

85
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,270
Even her only son nearly died.

86
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,160
Carrying the only keepsake
from his mother,

87
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,040
he grew up stumbling along.

88
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,430
Before getting married,
she smiled carefree,

89
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,360
but after marriage, even in portraits,

90
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,120
her eyes couldn't hide her sorrow.

91
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,870
She died a mysterious death,

92
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,800
while the murderer sat high and mighty,
stepping on her blood.

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,120
Who knows if she

94
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,600
regrets that encounter in the afterlife?

95
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,240
Who knows if that man

96
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,430
ever thought of her
in the silence of the night?

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,870
When you reach my age,
you will understand

98
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,390
love is not everything in life.

99
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,720
There are more important things.

100
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,360
But she paid her whole life for love.

101
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,120
If she had known she'd be the one
cast aside in the end,

102
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,310
maybe she'd have preferred

103
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,360
never to have met him.

104
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,000
Do you know,

105
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,680
just based on what you said just now,

106
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,160
I could charge you
with the crime of disrespect?

107
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,720
To this day,

108
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,040
do you still not want
to acknowledge your son?

109
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,560
Because I'm not
the late prince's biological son.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,920
So you...

111
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,160
Yes. I'm the emperor's firstborn son.

112
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,160
I'm the true heir.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,160
Summon Prince Su.

114
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,750
Whatever the princess said,

115
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,680
I'll bear full responsibility.

116
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,520
Rise.

117
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,310
Your eyes

118
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,160
are very much like Shuwan's.

119
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,240
Was it my brother who saved you?

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,750
I didn't expect you
to live by my side in this identity.

121
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,110
I don't dare.

122
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,240
You are the child of me and Shuwan.

123
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,270
I'll try harder to make it up to you

124
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,750
by giving you everything you deserve.

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,430
You have married a good wife.

126
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,270
The Grand Tutor is uptight,

127
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,830
but he has raised a daughter
like Princess Su.

128
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,560
That portrait of the beauty

129
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,630
is not just a painting.

130
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,800
What a pity.

131
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,000
I...

132
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,190
You deserve everything
that belongs to you.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,480
By the decree of heaven,
the emperor proclaims:

134
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,360
Prince Su Qianyu

135
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:03,120
is the legitimate son of me
and the late Empress Shuyi.

136
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,360
He is my legitimate firstborn.

137
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,430
Now, his identity has been confirmed.

138
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,000
He's now Prince Qianyu,

139
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,600
with his wife as Princess Qianyu.

140
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,680
He is bestowed with a royal seal
and will not be replaced.

141
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,630
Thus it is decreed.

142
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Congratulations, Qianyu.

143
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,390
Crown Prince, you're too kind.

144
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,840
It's just the beginning.

145
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,500
(Mansion of Prince Su)

146
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,030
Unexpectedly, with the princess's help,

147
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,240
this day would come so quickly.

148
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,820
So smoothly it's unbelievable.

149
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,390
Yes, I didn't expect it either.

150
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,670
Qi Xuan is even more capable
than I imagined.

151
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,790
I have a question for you.

152
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,150
Your feelings toward the princess...

153
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,240
I discovered her talent

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,510
for winning people over
during the envoy incident.

155
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,790
Unexpectedly, by accident,

156
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,240
she uncovered Consort Xian's flaws.

157
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,720
With many ups and downs,

158
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,420
the birthday banquet incident proved

159
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,670
my choice was not wrong.

160
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,620
(For longevity)

161
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,390
The envoy?

162
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,360
Wasn't he persuaded by you,
Your Highness?

163
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,120
What does it have to do
with the princess?

164
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,080
The princess offended the emperor.

165
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,120
What if the emperor punishes her?

166
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,960
But the facts prove

167
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,790
I was right, wasn't I?

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,440
Compared to a prince ambitious
for recognition

169
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,030
and holding military power,

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,390
a man who is impulsive for love

171
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,000
is easier for the emperor
to accept, right?

172
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,150
So do you truly just see
the princess as a tool?

173
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,270
When a person has feelings,

174
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,560
they have a weakness.

175
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,470
But I have more important matters.

176
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,240
No time for romantic entanglements.

177
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,280
Speak.

178
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,320
What do you want me for this time?

179
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,600
I need your help with something.

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,550
There's something I want
from the Eastern Palace.

181
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,240
Can you distract
the Crown Prince for me?

182
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,390
Distract the Crown Prince?
Is it for Su Qianyu?

183
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,220
Do you know by doing this,

184
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,910
you're putting yourself in danger?

185
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,550
You're so focused
on planning for Su Qianyu,

186
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,270
but what if his feelings for you

187
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,630
aren't as good as you think?

188
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,240
Will you really not regret it?

189
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,120
(Su Qianyu.)

190
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,750
(Do you know that the moment
I decided to stay,)

191
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,510
(I had given up everything?)

192
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,480
(So, you must not betray me.)

193
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,910
(It's been six months.)

194
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,720
(Though my memory hasn't returned,)

195
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,550
(Su Qianyu,)

196
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,870
(I feel as long as you're by my side,)

197
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,630
(nothing else matters.)

198
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,030
(We will always be together.)

199
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,120
(Just like you said,)

200
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,550
(living happily together
for a lifetime is enough.)

201
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,870
So, this is what my true memory is.

202
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,600
I told you I'm not sick.

203
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,080
Can't you face reality?

204
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,960
Do you think we can still
be happy like this?

205
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,270
You're hurting me.

206
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,480
You want to leave me.

207
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,150
Why are you avoiding it?

208
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,440
You want to leave me.

209
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,580
I'm telling you.
Don't even think about it.

210
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,440
Even if I die, I'll stay with you.

211
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,840
Can't you speak properly?

212
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,680
No, I can't.

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,080
Even if I die, I'll stay with you.

214
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,890
(So, this is how it is.)
