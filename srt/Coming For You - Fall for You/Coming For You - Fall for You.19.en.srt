=Episode 19=

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,830
Prince Su.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,480
Surprised that I wasn't poisoned?

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,710
On the day of the birthday banquet,

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,380
I noticed something was wrong
with the incense burner.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,960
Everyone else was fine,

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,670
so I didn't pay much attention.

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,790
Then the empress dowager fainted,

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,790
and I knew this matter was not simple.

14
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,670
So I played along

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,280
to lure you into my trap.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,240
Huizhu from the Eastern Palace.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,360
Speak.

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,750
Who sent you to poison?

19
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,110
Was it Consort Xian or the Crown Prince?

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,400
I don't know what you're saying.

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,840
Don't know what I'm saying?

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,070
I don't mind letting you know

23
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,310
how spies are treated in the military.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,920
Here's your chance.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,840
If you reveal the mastermind,
I will let you go.

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,280
If you choose not to say,

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,000
I will just stab you a few more times.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,710
You will have a chance
before your blood runs dry.

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,480
I promise you.

30
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,040
Princess, please take your medicine.

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,300
The physician said
you were startled in the Cold Palace

32
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,560
and had a cold.

33
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,590
You need nourishment.

34
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,630
I don't want to drink it.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,310
What about Su Qianyu?

36
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,560
Princess, don't worry.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,000
The prince has found the real culprit.

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,310
He is meeting with the Emperor.

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,000
I heard it involves
the Crown Prince and Consort Xian.

40
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,190
There's bound to be some arguing.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
Father, believe me.

42
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,870
(Yangxin Hall)
Huizhu is a maid from Mother's palace,

43
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,740
but this absolutely
has nothing to do

44
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,070
(Confession)
with me and Mother.

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,800
The evidence is right here.

46
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,080
The maid is from your palace.

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,680
You still claim to be innocent?

48
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,280
Do you think I'm old and confused?

49
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,870
Your Majesty,
it is my fault for being too lenient.

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,910
It has nothing to do
with the Crown Prince.

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,310
This has nothing to do with Mother.

52
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,430
It's all my fault.

53
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,310
If you have to,
blame me for my poor judgment.

54
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,270
I harmed Grandmother

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,840
and almost harmed you.

56
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,870
What do you mean by this?

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,360
Mother sent the maid Huizhu

58
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,190
to the Eastern Palace
to teach my concubine some etiquette,

59
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,810
but the concubine bribed her.

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,920
In the end,

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,310
it was my fault
for being too sentimental.

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,500
It's quite regrettable.

63
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,400
Yue is a distant relative of Prince Su,

64
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
so I didn't guard against her.

65
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,600
That is how I was deceived.

66
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,310
What do you mean?

67
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,910
I have found out Yue's true identity.

68
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,870
Her father used
to work for the late prince.

69
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,910
He was executed by your order

70
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,560
for failing in his military duties.

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't know how she managed to escape,

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,110
but she must've come to me

73
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,080
to seek revenge against you.

74
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,200
Qianyu.

75
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,750
Is this news true?

76
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,870
Your Majesty.

77
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,910
It was part of my father's fault
for negligence.

78
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,750
Mother took her in when Yue escaped.

79
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,360
You did not exterminate them completely,

80
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,520
so we've never had
any thoughts of treason.

81
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,280
But recently, Yue met the Crown Prince.

82
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,790
After the Crown Prince
sought to marry her,

83
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,960
she suddenly wanted
to take revenge for her father.

84
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,040
The true reason

85
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,760
needs to be investigated thoroughly.

86
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,580
Princess Su is here.

87
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,880
Sister.

88
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,800
You really do look like
a refined lady now.

89
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,160
I have to thank you
for your previous teachings.

90
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,440
No matter how stupid,
I should've learned by now.

91
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,680
Did you come here to mock me today?

92
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,480
Do you regret it?

93
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,040
Regret?

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,120
What exactly did he do to you

95
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,000
that made you love him so much?

96
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,070
The Crown Prince
cleared my family's name.

97
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,270
(Yue Residence)
He provided me

98
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,710
with a place to stay
when I was down and out.

99
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,950
Even knowing how he has
used me multiple times,

100
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,100
(Yue Residence)

101
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,480
I have never regretted it.

102
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,920
I am Su Qianxu.

103
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,870
He once saved my life.

104
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,120
Consider this my repayment.

105
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,070
Just because he saved you
and helped you,

106
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,070
you are so devoted to him?

107
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,920
What if all of this

108
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,430
was his plan?

109
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,430
What do you mean?

110
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,600
Regardless of the truth, Yue must die.

111
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,040
Qianyu handled this very well.

112
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,830
When the Crown Prince
inherits the throne,

113
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,560
you will assist him,

114
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,750
and I can rest easy.

115
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,360
Your family's case has nothing to do
with the late Prince Su.

116
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,720
General Yue was eager for quick success
and fell into the enemy's trap.

117
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,720
The late prince was too lenient.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,750
When criticized by His Majesty,
he still pleaded for your family.

119
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,600
The tragedy of your family

120
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,270
is not the late prince's fault.

121
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,600
Nonsense.

122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,920
Su Qianyu has investigated.

123
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,060
(Yue Residence)

124
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,510
Su Qianxu saving you that day

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,120
was part of his plan.

126
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,390
You thought you were destined,

127
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,720
but little did you know
he was using you all along.

128
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,040
He said you approached him
to take revenge for your family

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,430
and to incite rebellion.

130
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,830
(He's the Crown Prince.)

131
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,590
(Is this why he can be forgiven
even with murder intent?)

132
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,560
(If the world is truly this unfair,)

133
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,310
(I'll definitely)

134
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,000
(fight for the throne.)

135
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,680
My life has become a joke.

136
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,510
What I owe you will only
be repaid in the next life.

137
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,310
Su Qianyu has arranged
everything for you.

138
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,800
You won't be in any trouble.

139
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,630
But from now on, you cannot
step into the capital even once.

140
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,680
With you by Qianyu's side,

141
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
I truly feel at ease.

142
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,390
Remind Qianyu to be careful.

143
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,270
What you want is now

144
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,750
in the Crown Prince's hands.

145
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,190
What's this?

146
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,870
I heard from Luoyun

147
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,630
that there's an effective marriage tree
at Hongluo Temple in Jiangnan.

148
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,460
You can get what you want.

149
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,360
We can't go to Jiangnan,

150
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,670
so I had them arrange this

151
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,230
based on that tree.

152
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,910
What is this for?

153
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,420
This is for seeking a marriage.

154
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,080
But we are already married.

155
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,110
Not enough.

156
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,000
I want to hold your hand

157
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
and grow old with you,

158
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,360
to be together for eternity

159
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,750
and never be separated.

160
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,600
I didn't expect you to believe in this.

161
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,950
I didn't believe in it before,

162
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,840
but since I met you,

163
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,750
I seem to have become greedier,

164
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
wanting to be with you longer

165
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,960
and live longer.

166
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,220
So even if I end up in hell after death,

167
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,090
I'd feel it's worth it.

168
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,080
What nonsense are you saying?

169
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,630
It's not nonsense.

170
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,070
This is my mother's jade pendant.

171
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,790
Her maiden name was Shuwan.

172
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,000
This is the only thing she left for me.

173
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,480
Now I am giving my most precious thing

174
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,160
to you.

175
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,790
Since you were locked
in the Cold Palace,

176
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,240
I haven't slept well or eaten properly,

177
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,010
fearing you might get hurt.

178
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,230
I'm so afraid.

179
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,750
You're so afraid of losing me?

180
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
So, if one day

181
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,750
I suddenly disappear from your world,

182
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,960
what will you do?

183
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,710
♪That light is the strength
from your protection♪

184
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,420
♪That light guides me,

By the way,

196
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,560
I wanted to tell you

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,150
that I've been having
weird dreams lately.

198
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,750
I dreamt I arrived in the Great Yan,

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,720
where there was a cold-faced prince
named Su Qianyu.

200
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,630
Then it seemed I swapped
bodies with that prince.

201
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,720
I became him, and he became me.

202
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,120
The first time we swapped,

203
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,840
and the second time we switched back.

204
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,510
Isn't that strange?

205
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,820
Though it's quite strange,

206
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,700
I'm still very happy
that you are in my dreams.

207
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,320
And then?

208
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,720
And then? Of course,
I haven't dreamed of it.

209
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,720
But if it's a happy ending,

210
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,600
I will tell you.

211
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,850
It'll definitely be a happy ending.
