=Episode 8=

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,830
I'm Qi Xuan,
an ancient painting appraiser.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,670
Because of an ancient painting,

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,120
I got trapped in a dynasty
that history never recorded,

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,510
the Great Yan.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,310
(Spirit Tablet of Shuwan)
I've tried every way to go home.

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,150
Spirit Tablet of Shuwan.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,750
After visiting the forbidden area,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,350
I finally found the hidden painting
in the mansion.

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,320
But this painting isn't that one.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,520
The late princess's maiden name
wasn't Shuwan.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,240
Who is the beauty in Firefly Scroll?

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,240
The late empress?

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,600
Then the true painter
of Firefly Scroll...

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,560
(Changze)

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,400
Luoyun.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,240
I have a question for you.

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,080
What is it?

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,140
The late prince's courtesy name
is Changze.

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,980
(Changze)

25
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,430
Do you know

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,760
the emperor's courtesy name?

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,120
I have no other intention.

28
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,640
I just can't remember for a moment.

29
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,070
Remind me.

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,040
Well...

31
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,070
Well...

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,070
Now, it's just the two of us.

33
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,710
Speak freely.

34
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,070
Yes.

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,280
Changze, Changyuan.

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,070
(Changze, Changyuan)

37
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,870
If this wasn't painted
by the late prince,

38
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,590
could it be...

39
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,680
Then it is...

40
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,120
It's painted by the emperor?

41
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,480
The true Firefly Scroll is

42
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,270
in the palace.

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,310
Prince, the palace summoned you.

44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Great Zhou has promised to continue

45
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,910
honoring the treaty with us.

46
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,840
They have offered sincere concessions.

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Qianyu, your contributions
are undeniable.

48
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,360
It is your wise governance
that has led to Great Zhou's response.

49
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,000
I just got lucky and took the chance.

50
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,520
People say you are ruthless
and unapproachable,

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,280
but to me, you have made great progress.

52
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,870
Combining both grace and authority

53
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,000
will lead to longer-lasting results.

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,080
You've guided me wisely.

55
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,360
Prince Su is perceptive.

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,590
Your intricacies are elusive.

57
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,840
No wonder you could easily
secure the treaty with Great Zhou.

58
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,400
Mr. Sang, you don't know.

59
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,000
This success was entirely

60
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
due to my princess.

61
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,310
If we are to talk about merit,

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,030
she deserves the top credit.

63
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,630
The princess is truly exceptional.

64
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,030
With a wife like her,

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,080
you are indeed fortunate.

66
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,680
It seems you've often

67
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,190
targeted me.

68
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,630
Everything happens for a reason.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,750
Have you considered
that it might be your doing?

70
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,310
(Me?)

71
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,960
(What's wrong with me?)

72
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,560
(Did I err in being too nice to you?)

73
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,360
Prince Su is unwell today,

74
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
yet you are busy
currying favor in court.

75
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,190
Your behavior

76
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,280
doesn't deserve my respect.

77
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,630
(You're worried about me.)

78
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,710
(The meals weren't in vain.)

79
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,080
Don't worry; she's fine.

80
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,120
What is happening here?

81
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,000
Miss, is this your first time out?

82
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,360
This is the annual riddle contest
at the Top Scholar Tower.

83
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
The areas with fewer lanterns
are more difficult.

84
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,190
You must pass through them
in order of difficulty.

85
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,430
The middle one is the hardest.

86
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,750
The grand prize is a dangling hairpin.

87
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,560
Young ladies like you
will surely love it.

88
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,270
It's just solving riddles.

89
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,760
Miss.

90
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,320
Miss.

91
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,390
What do you want?

92
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,870
You just said you would accept the bet.

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,120
I won't let you have it.

94
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,390
You've misunderstood me.

95
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,360
I'm San Zhi,

96
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,870
looking for a method
to solve problems.

97
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,310
A method to solve problems?

98
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,440
That's easy.

99
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,830
Pythagorean theorem
and various mathematical methods.

100
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,720
You can solve it this way.

101
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,150
Got it?

102
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,150
Got it.

103
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Your method is simpler

104
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,160
and easier to understand
than Master Qi's.

105
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,270
Master Qi?

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Is that Princess Su's father?

107
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,030
Do you know him?

108
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,600
I'm Qi Xuan.

109
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,630
I'm Princess Su.

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,480
Then I'll call you Xuan from now on.

111
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,040
This is so delicious.

112
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,070
Xuan, did you really make this?

113
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,870
Of course.

114
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,070
Sir, give me one of these.

115
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,000
By the way, Xuan,

116
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,070
I have two more problems. This one...

117
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,680
It's always solving problems
when I come out.

118
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,200
What's wrong?

119
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,390
I've been targeted
by Prince Su's people.

120
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,070
It's been tough.

121
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,390
I finally snuck out today,

122
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,720
yet it's problems again.

123
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,190
You can cook chicken legs,

124
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,830
make windmills,

125
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,710
and do math.

126
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,190
You're amazing.

127
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,480
What else are you capable of?

128
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,750
I like smooth talkers like you.

129
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,120
You're surely my friend now.

130
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,920
You're my first friend here.

131
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,070
If you're just going to hurt her,

132
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,240
why not let her be free?

133
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,310
I brush it off because I really am fine.

134
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,960
Alright then.

135
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,920
I always have to pay my debt.

136
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,780
(Changze, Changyuan)

137
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,260
(Spirit Tablet of Shuwan)

138
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,240
The imperial palace is so big.

139
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,720
It'd take forever to find it.

140
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,680
(She seems to have a high status.)

141
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,830
(Is she a consort in the palace?)

142
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,480
(But her behavior with this actor)

143
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,480
(seems a bit too intimate.)

144
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,150
Consort Xian, are you satisfied with me?

145
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,080
Consort Xian?

146
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,790
The Crown Prince's mother?

147
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,710
Who is there?

148
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,360
(It's been a week.)

149
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,390
(You haven't woken up.)

150
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,680
(Qi Xuan.)

151
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,030
(I don't know
how long I can wait.)

152
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,630
(You said before)

153
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,120
(you'd always be with me.)

154
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,630
(You'd go wherever I go.)

155
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,080
(You promised to grow old with me.)
