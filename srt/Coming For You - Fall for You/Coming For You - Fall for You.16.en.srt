6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,000
Today, let's talk
about the Seventh Fairy.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,560
(Wind Pavilion)
Have they changed their style?

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,280
No more royal anecdotes,

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,360
but the Seventh Fairy story.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,470
It's normal;
they need new content to offer.

11
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,600
Compared to tragic romances,

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,200
the Seventh Fairy and Dong Yong
become a couple in the end.

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,710
It's more satisfying.

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,310
Do you like it?

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,840
I wouldn't say that.

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,150
The Seventh Fairy's story
may seem perfect,

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,110
but it's been romanticized
by the people.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,640
They've forgotten that it started
with Dong Yong hiding the fairy's wings.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,560
(Wind Pavilion)

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,310
How can I like feelings
gained through deceit?

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,270
You're right.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,230
If you were the heroine of this story,

23
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,310
who knows if the tale

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,870
of the wicked prince
and the charming princess

25
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,710
would have a happy ending?

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,280
I've told you it was made up
by Wind Pavilion.

27
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,760
We should head home.

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
(Mansion of Prince Su)

29
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,480
Is this the birthday cake you mentioned?

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,760
That's right.

31
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,310
The cake may look unusual,

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,070
but the empress dowager has had
something similar.

33
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,120
How can you be sure she'll like it?

34
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,510
This is just a test version.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,840
The final design
is what will win her over.

36
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,080
I heard your embroidery is unmatched.

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,430
You've lived up to your name.

38
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,330
If this is the birthday gift,

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,030
the empress dowager will be delighted.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,240
Thanks to your skilled painter,

41
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,030
I was able to recreate
the empress dowager's handwriting.

42
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,080
Time is tight.

43
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,150
Will it be finished before her birthday?

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Rest assured.

45
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,480
Then I'll leave it to you.
