(Gweon Suk's birthday)

3
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:18,464
A baobab tree?

4
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:21,233
There's one
in a botanical garden here too.

5
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:22,633
Let's go on your birthday.

6
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:24,464
Are you sure?

7
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:32,413
(Incoming Call)

8
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:40,083
Hello.

9
00:00:40,513 --> 00:00:42,823
Mr. Kim. This is Oh Bok.

10
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:45,653
So you wanted to talk to me?

11
00:00:47,553 --> 00:00:50,263
Oh, no. Don't tell me
you already forgot my voice.

12
00:00:51,924 --> 00:00:54,464
Where are you now?

13
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:56,303
Do you want to meet me here?

14
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:59,503
Hold on. This place is...

15
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:06,774
(Fruits, Vegetables)

17
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:39,844
(Did you forget about today?)

18
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:55,624
Come on, babe.

19
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,183
It's good to see you again, Mr. Kim.

20
00:02:23,984 --> 00:02:25,224
You've been keeping busy.

21
00:02:27,754 --> 00:02:29,463
You've been avoiding the police...

22
00:02:29,593 --> 00:02:30,993
while taking care
of Ye Jun's hospital bills...

23
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:32,863
and my mother's store too.

24
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,033
I don't appreciate that tone.

25
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:39,063
As for the boy's surgery,
it was just the chairman's kind gesture.

26
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:41,734
"Kind gesture?"

27
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:45,504
You made them sign a promissory note
and charged them a high interest rate.

28
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:46,613
You call that a kind gesture?

29
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:48,743
My gosh. You're out of line.

30
00:02:49,884 --> 00:02:52,144
We let them borrow a large amount of money
without collateral.

31
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:55,183
We did it to get on your good side.

32
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:57,083
Stop talking such gibberish.

33
00:02:57,783 --> 00:02:59,023
It's not gibberish.

34
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:01,053
We still have a match left.

35
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:02,093
With Lee Gweon Suk.

36
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:05,294
Kim Hee Won ruined everything for us.

37
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:07,033
We need to recover our losses.

38
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,604
Forget about Gweon Suk's match.

39
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:12,363
The deal is off.

40
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:14,803
What do you mean?

41
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:16,903
You can't decide that unilaterally.

42
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:19,644
I agreed to the deal on the condition
that Hee Won's safety would be guaranteed.

43
00:03:19,873 --> 00:03:22,273
So the deal broke the moment Hee Won died.

44
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:24,713
However, I have another athlete for you.

45
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:27,713
Who? Let me hear you out.

46
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:31,583
But it has to be someone
as good as Lee Gweon Suk.

47
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:35,493
Do not hover around
Hee Won's family again.

48
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,924
The same goes for Gweon Suk.

49
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,694
Don't worry about that.

50
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:57,683
Enjoy.

51
00:03:57,683 --> 00:03:58,884
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

(Episode 10)

53
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:06,694
It's from your son.

54
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:19,833
Hey.

55
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:23,173
Why spend money
on something you can't even eat?

56
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:24,273
What a waste.

57
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,614
So? You don't think the flowers look nice?

58
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:27,874
They're pretty,

59
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:29,944
but all I can do is look at them.
It's wasteful.

60
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:31,614
Mom, seriously.

61
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:35,413
I bought them for you to look at them,
so stare at them all day.

62
00:04:36,554 --> 00:04:38,824
Thanks to my son,
my eyes will be very happy all day.

63
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:42,864
Hey, have you been eating well?

64
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:44,463
Of course.
Did you think I'd starve myself?

65
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:46,033
Anyway, I have to go. I'll call you later.

66
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,194
Hey, I know you're busy.
You don't need to call me often.

67
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:50,134
Just call me from time to time...

68
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:52,064
so I'll know that you're alive and well.

69
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:54,033
Okay.

70
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:55,333
All right, then.

71
00:05:00,014 --> 00:05:01,574
My gosh.

72
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:13,454
Here's a surprise quiz for you.

73
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:14,894
Is there a baobab tree...

74
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:17,463
on the Little Prince's planet or not?

75
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,564
Can you talk?

76
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:28,704
Mister.

77
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:33,213
When will he be here?

78
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:38,184
When will he get here?

79
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,124
Dummy.

80
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:50,564
Look here. Yes, that's it.

81
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:54,833
Nice, that's great. Perfect.

82
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:58,603
They're closing soon. Come on.
Let's go. We should get going.

83
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:07,014
(Did you forget about today?)

84
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:48,554
Mister!

85
00:06:52,283 --> 00:06:53,454
Mister!

86
00:06:55,394 --> 00:06:56,463
Over here!

87
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:03,764
Wait for me in front of the baobab tree.

88
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:05,434
I'll be down soon!

89
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:17,343
Mister.

90
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:44,074
What took you so long?

91
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:45,874
It's almost closing time.

92
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:52,014
No, we still have some time left.

93
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:55,413
Going upstairs just in case
was a good call, I guess.

94
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,184
I could have missed you.

95
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:00,554
You could have called me then.

96
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:04,793
I texted you, but you didn't text me back.

97
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:07,134
I have pride too.

98
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:11,403
Just answer the quiz already.

99
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:13,434
What's the answer?

100
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:14,903
What quiz?

101
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:16,403
Come on.

102
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:19,614
Is there a baobab tree
on Little Prince's planet? Yes...

103
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:20,913
or no?

104
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:23,043
Gosh. What a childish quiz.

105
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,213
There must be one probably.

106
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:28,754
Wrong!

107
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:30,684
No?

108
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:31,684
No.

109
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:34,494
Little Prince didn't like it
because it was considered a bad plant.

110
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:42,903
But why was the baobab tree
considered bad?

111
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:45,203
It looked cute.

112
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:46,533
Oh, that?

113
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:49,374
The roots of the baobab tree are...

114
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:51,474
three times bigger than the tree itself.

115
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:54,474
But Little Prince's planet was small.

116
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:58,043
He was afraid that
the tree would take over his planet...

117
00:08:58,043 --> 00:09:00,084
and break it into pieces.

118
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:02,984
Then why did you want to see such a tree?

119
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:04,953
Well,

120
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:07,624
if I have to give you an answer for that,

121
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:12,023
I would say that
boxing was my baobab tree.

122
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:15,634
I'm afraid
it might break my life into pieces.

123
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:19,364
But now that I'm seeing it in person,
it's not so scary-looking.

124
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:21,874
It's smaller than I pictured.

125
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:22,874
Mister.

126
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:25,104
Mister. Dummy.

127
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:26,844
What is this?

128
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:31,313
Mister is an idiot.

129
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:43,023
(Rest Stop)

130
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:50,563
Gosh. Your match is around the corner.

131
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:52,334
Be quiet.

132
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:54,073
It's my birthday, though.

133
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:09,724
After we parted ways,

134
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,384
I had a lot of thoughts.

135
00:10:14,793 --> 00:10:15,793
Like what?

136
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:18,464
Remember what I told you?

137
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:23,004
I said you would be the first to know
if I figured out...

138
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:25,063
whether I still wanted to lose or not.

139
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:28,573
Go on.

140
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:30,573
Did you figure out what you wanted?

141
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:32,474
No.

142
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:36,984
A part of me wants to lose the match
big time and retire as a boxer.

143
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:40,683
But I realized that my life was nothing...

144
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,913
without boxing.

145
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:45,953
I'm not good at anything
other than boxing.

146
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:49,094
I have no dreams either.

147
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,033
Then...

148
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:56,933
try to win this match.

149
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:00,374
You want me to win?

150
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:03,144
What about my retirement?

151
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:05,244
You can win
and then tell people the truth.

152
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:07,714
That actually, boxing...

153
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:09,884
scares you, and you don't like boxing.

154
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:16,053
Don't get mad.

155
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:19,183
Just ask them from the bottom
of your heart to let you go.

156
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:21,894
What's important is that...

157
00:11:22,754 --> 00:11:24,394
you cannot leave...

158
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:27,264
even an ounce of regret in that ring.

159
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:31,203
That way,
you'll figure out what you're made of...

160
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:34,033
and what you'll need to do.
It will come to you then.

161
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:36,443
If I win,

162
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:39,773
will it come to me?

163
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:41,913
If you try to win.

164
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:44,614
So...

165
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:47,354
if you don't have any regrets left.

166
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:53,594
Mister.

167
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:56,224
If...

168
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:57,923
Yes.

169
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:01,364
If I win the match,

170
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,163
what happens to you?

171
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:05,933
What?

172
00:12:06,403 --> 00:12:08,334
I know you're hiding something from me.

173
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:13,974
It was odd that you asked me to lose
when we first met.

174
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:16,443
Look at what happened
with Kim Hee Won too.

175
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:23,624
Are you sure you're okay?

176
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:26,653
Hee Won was framed
for something he didn't do.

177
00:12:27,323 --> 00:12:28,693
I'm trying to sort that out...

178
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,563
because he's got no one but me.

179
00:12:34,193 --> 00:12:35,394
It's not dangerous, right?

180
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,104
Gosh. You've watched too many movies.

181
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:41,673
No.

182
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:43,543
You need to retire.

183
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:46,943
I'm just being careful,
so you don't end up in a scandal.

184
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:51,484
So if anyone asks about me,

185
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:54,313
say that we stopped working together
a long time ago.

186
00:12:55,283 --> 00:12:56,283
Okay?

187
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:03,163
I trust you.

188
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:07,634
Even if the whole world tells me
you're a bad person,

189
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:10,933
I'll trust you to the end.

190
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:15,773
Okay.

191
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:19,874
It's getting late. You should go inside.

192
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:23,913
You'll come back soon, right?

193
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:31,183
Even when the match is over
and I'm retired,

194
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:35,754
you'll stay by my side, right?

195
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:39,764
Happy birthday.

196
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:42,594
Welcome to adulthood.

197
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:47,234
That took you long enough.

198
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:51,004
You didn't even buy me a birthday cake.

199
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:53,474
You owe me. Okay?

200
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:55,913
You'd better buy me
a birthday cake next year.

201
00:13:58,313 --> 00:13:59,313
Sure.

202
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,714
Next time.

203
00:14:31,683 --> 00:14:33,484
Even when the match is over
and I'm retired,

204
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:36,823
you'll stay by my side, right?

(Coach Yang Man Hee)

206
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:46,163
This is the last time.

207
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,163
Lose my number.

208
00:14:49,063 --> 00:14:50,334
And stop coming to me.

209
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:52,563
Then don't give me a reason
to come to you.

210
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:55,374
This is the last time
I'm letting you take my score.

211
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:57,344
I'll come after yours.

212
00:14:59,543 --> 00:15:00,673
I'm not joking.

213

(Ma Young Jun)

214
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:24,663
Bam.

215
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:33,443
Where did you go
this early in the morning?

216
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:36,783
You're not trying to join me
on my roadwork again, right?

217
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:41,653
Gosh. Now that I'm getting older,

218
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:43,984
I'm not so sleepy in the morning.

219
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:46,183
Look at these tomatoes.

220
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:49,293
I let them ripen
until they got nice and red.

221
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:51,124
They are so tasty.

222
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,033
Gosh. What other ingredients
did he say I should add?

223
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:12,943
What?

224
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:14,584
Jae Min.

225
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:17,183
What are you doing here?

226
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:18,683
Me?

227
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:20,653
Well...

228
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:23,053
What was it?

229
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:26,023
What?

230
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:28,234
Who knows if you don't?

231
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:31,334
I'm here anyway, so let's jog together.

232
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:33,903
Oh, right. "Running crew." That's it.

233
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:37,104
What running crew? That's just a hassle.

234
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:39,703
Go home.

235
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:42,514
I don't mind jogging on my own. Go.

236
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:47,183
Really? I'll go back to bed, then.

237
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:02,663
You said you were going back to bed.

238
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:04,533
Well, I suddenly felt...

239
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:07,203
wide-awake on my way home.

240
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:12,003
You smiled.

241
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:15,013
It's a rewarding day!

242
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,394
Eat this for breakfast from now on.

243
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:39,663
This isn't about boxing.
It's me looking out for your health.

244
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:41,003
From Dad.

245
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:44,844
I didn't say anything.

246
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:57,983

Auntie.

250
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:03,963
- It's not "Auntie..."
- It's Big Sis.

251
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:05,193
Where are you going?

252
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:06,663
Where else would I go?

253
00:18:06,663 --> 00:18:08,894
I'll go to the restaurant
then to the boxing gym.

254
00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:09,963
Why?

255
00:18:12,903 --> 00:18:15,903
Can you show us a reverse punch?

256
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,243
What?

257
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:20,413
Pow. Okay, once more.

258
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:22,173
And then...

259
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:29,314
Hey. Who said
you could film me without permission?

260
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:32,084
We won't post it, so don't worry.

261
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:34,453
It's for personal use.

262
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:38,223
Everyone films to practice these days.

263
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:42,894
Do you think boxing's fun?

264
00:18:42,894 --> 00:18:43,963
- Yes.
- Yes.

265
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:45,364
- You like boxing?
- Yes!

266
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,134
You do?

267
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:49,074
You're really bad at it.

268
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:50,203
Is it still fun?

269
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:51,203
- Yes!
- Yes!

270
00:18:52,274 --> 00:18:54,644
Why? It's only fun if you're good at it.

271
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:57,743
He said we were kids,
so it was okay to be bad at it.

272
00:18:57,844 --> 00:19:00,183
We just have to have fun. Right?

273
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:05,153
- Who said so?
- Our coach did.

274

A shoulder injury?

279
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:25,743
She's been in treatment for a week.

280
00:19:26,104 --> 00:19:28,243
Shall we make a move?

281
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:29,344
Like what?

282
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:31,044
Take care of Lee Gweon Suk, for example.

283
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,084
- We should do something.
- Let her be.

284
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:35,513
- It works for us.
- How so?

285
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:38,054
If Han Ah Reum has a shoulder injury,

286
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:41,054
who would our clients bet on?

287
00:19:42,324 --> 00:19:44,963
- Wouldn't they bet on Lee Gweon Suk?
- Yes, they would.

288

And if she loses?
Who gets to keep that money?

289

Oh... I get it.

290
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:58,673
We can't keep this good news to ourselves.

291
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:02,814
- Call the journalists.
- Okay.

292
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:06,344
"Han Ah Reum's shoulder injury."

293
00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:09,554
"Clouds loom over the match
to defend the title."

294
00:20:10,013 --> 00:20:11,683
These sharks...

295
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:15,993
Shouldn't they at least
call us first to confirm?

296
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:17,624
Okay.

297
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:20,163
I'll send a press release.

298
00:20:20,864 --> 00:20:21,894
Bye.

299
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:24,534
Will they print a correction?

300
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:26,233
I'm asking around.

301
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:29,203
I'm not sure if they will, though.

302
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,074
Get me an interview, then.

303
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,044
I can't fight properly like this.

304
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:47,894
Did you read the Han Ah Reum acticle?

305
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:49,453
Yes.

306
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:51,923
Won't that mess with your plan?

307
00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:54,693
You want Suk to fight,
lose, and move to the US.

308
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,294
What if she were to lose now?

309
00:20:56,433 --> 00:21:00,003
"The expert runaway couldn't even beat
an injured Han Ah Reum, LOL."

310
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:01,933
That's what people will say.

311
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:02,973
She can win, then.

312
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:07,013
"You're happy about beating
an injured girl? LOL."

313
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:08,044
That's what...

314
00:21:10,844 --> 00:21:11,943
You want her to win?

315
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:15,013
- Yes.
- You mean actually win?

316
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,524
Yes.

317
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,483
Was there a change of plan?

318
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:21,223
Or did I miss something?

319
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:23,594
Why do you keep changing your mind?

320
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:25,094
So what? You object?

321
00:21:27,193 --> 00:21:28,263
I do not.

322
00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:35,774
This tastes so good.

323
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:40,644
- Tae Young.
- Thanks.

324
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:47,784
I might go to the police soon.

325
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:49,483
What?

326
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:51,354
Tae Young.

327
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:53,723
Hee Won's match fixing.

328
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,693
I was involved.

329
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:57,763
Gweon Suk's contract too.

330
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:01,663
I kind of...

331
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:04,604
had an idea.

332
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:10,274
It took Hee Won's death...

333
00:22:11,804 --> 00:22:12,903
for me to see it.

334
00:22:14,844 --> 00:22:18,114
That you shouldn't cover up
one wrong with another.

335
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,284
Before the match,

336
00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:26,054
I want to get everyone
who was involved behind bars.

337
00:22:26,384 --> 00:22:28,854
So that no one
can mess with Gweon Suk's match.

338
00:22:30,923 --> 00:22:32,064
Then I'll turn myself in.

339
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,094
Is there anything I can do to help?

340
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:39,503
Help Gweon Suk to the end so she can win.

341
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:41,534
That's what you do best.

342
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:43,844
Don't worry about that.

343
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:49,544
Thanks a lot for turning a blind eye.

344
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:51,584
Not at all.

345
00:23:06,024 --> 00:23:07,364
(Will Han Give up? How Bad's the Injury?)

346
00:23:07,364 --> 00:23:08,394
(Pharmacy)

347
00:23:13,663 --> 00:23:14,703
Where were you?

348
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:18,644
I had lunch and went for a walk.

349
00:23:20,344 --> 00:23:23,074
Where's Ms. Jo? She's not here yet?

350
00:23:23,614 --> 00:23:24,784
Not yet.

351
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:26,513
She didn't call?

352
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:29,253
She's getting me all worried now.

353
00:23:51,274 --> 00:23:52,503
Mr. Ma Young Jun.

354
00:23:57,314 --> 00:23:58,344
Who are you?

355
00:24:01,554 --> 00:24:03,013
I'm a fan of yours.

356
00:24:03,554 --> 00:24:05,253
You don't seem like a simple fan.

357
00:24:06,784 --> 00:24:09,153
The Korean League's
greatest relief pitcher.

358
00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:11,394
You got freed up.

359
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:13,024
Am I too late?

360
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:16,993
Oh, are you an agent?

361
00:24:18,364 --> 00:24:19,903
Would you like to play in the US?

362
00:24:20,473 --> 00:24:22,203
Yes, of course, I would.

363
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:24,274
I'm working on my batting.

364
00:24:24,844 --> 00:24:26,544
Do you think you can help me?

365
00:24:27,574 --> 00:24:28,673
I'd be honored to.

366
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:31,084
It's just that...

367
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:46,763
Give me a call.

368
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,081
My legs are all stiff
after jogging just that once.

369
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,480
Why did you bother to come back, then?
You shouldn't have.

370
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,290
Right.

371
00:25:09,862 --> 00:25:11,231
But I made a promise.

372
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:12,832
A promise?

373
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:14,461
With who?

374
00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:17,631
Well, I made a promise to myself.

375
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:21,201
I'll jog with you until the day
of your match. We got this!

376
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:23,711
You're doing great.

377
00:25:26,782 --> 00:25:28,881
Gosh, she's still not answering.

378
00:25:32,122 --> 00:25:33,122
Is she still not picking up?

379
00:25:36,252 --> 00:25:39,092
Coach, did you hurt her feelings
or something?

380
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:40,891
Me?

381
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:42,661
What could I have done to...

382
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:45,302
Show some interest in me too.

383
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:48,032
I am one of
Emperor Diet Boxing's boxers too, you see.

384
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:52,201
Gosh.

385
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:53,502
So you did something.

386
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:56,072
Don't you have her address?

387
00:25:56,342 --> 00:25:58,141
It's in her file, but...

388
00:25:58,582 --> 00:25:59,582
Then why don't you visit her?

389
00:26:00,181 --> 00:26:01,181
Why should I?

390
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:03,282
Having to take care of you
is keeping me busy enough.

391
00:26:05,752 --> 00:26:07,881
Then put your phone down.

392
00:26:24,372 --> 00:26:25,572
(Executive Director Kwon Gui Duk)

393
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:26,572
"MMA?"

394
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:28,141
Mixed martial arts?

395
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:33,681
The match is only a week away,

396
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:35,512
so I must ask you...

397
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:37,711
about your injury.

398
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:39,481
How's your recovery coming along?

399
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:44,191
My right rotator cuff is still a bit torn.

400
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:46,262
But I'm conscientiously receiving
rehabilitation treatment,

401
00:26:46,262 --> 00:26:47,622
and it's been going well so far.

402
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:50,931
I hope you won't suddenly give up
on the match.

403
00:26:54,161 --> 00:26:56,372
I have no interest in running away
whatsoever.

404
00:26:57,671 --> 00:26:58,671
However,

405
00:27:00,372 --> 00:27:02,711
I have a favor to ask all of you.

406
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:05,282
A favor? What is it?

407
00:27:06,512 --> 00:27:08,112
I hope you can please...

408
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:10,381
stop asking me about my injury.

409
00:27:11,481 --> 00:27:14,122
I think it's insulting to both myself...

410
00:27:14,122 --> 00:27:16,092
and Gweon Suk,
my opponent in the upcoming match.

411
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:18,491
Every athlete
has suffered an injury or two.

412
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,691
I'm sure Gweon Suk...

413
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:22,832
is in pain too.

414
00:27:23,532 --> 00:27:25,661
If there's a winner in the match,

415
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:27,901
it means the winner did a great job.

416
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:29,102
If there's a loser,

417
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:32,372
it means the loser lost
because they couldn't beat the winner,

418
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,042
not because of an injury.

419
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:37,171
Isn't that how a match works?

420
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:39,842
And isn't that what boxing is all about?

421
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:45,622
She really is a champion.

422
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:48,282
That was cool.

423
00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:50,991
Gweon Suk.

424
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:53,191
- Yes?
- Tae Young is hoping...

425
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:57,931
you'll win this fight instead of losing.

426
00:27:58,901 --> 00:27:59,901
Yes.

427
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:02,302
He told me that too.

428
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:03,901
All right, then.

429
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:06,842
As of this moment, don't think
about anything else but winning.

430
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:08,342
Okay?

431
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:09,842
You seem to be in a good mood, Coach.

432
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:11,812
Hey. Of course, I'm in a good mood.

433
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,512
Isn't that how a match works?

434
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:16,951
And isn't that what boxing is all about?

435
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:19,721
Hey, let's be honest.

436
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:21,691
It was ridiculous
that you had to practice to lose.

437
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:24,651
I mean, tying your arms like that.
What was that?

438
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:26,092
You're not a dog on a leash.

439
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:29,161
You can beat Ah Reum, right?

440
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,502
Hey, Suk.

441
00:28:36,072 --> 00:28:37,602
Look deep into your heart.

442
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,602
Your desire to win.

443
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:42,711
Just awaken that desire,

444
00:28:43,072 --> 00:28:44,342
and I'm sure you'll win.

445
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,842
Which movie is that line from?

446
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,082
She's a WBC World Champion.

447
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:53,752
You are Lee Gweon Suk.

448
00:28:55,622 --> 00:28:58,252
You beat Estomata, the legendary boxer.

449
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:01,092
You're a championship gold medalist
and a boxing idol.

450
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:19,812
All right, here it is.

451
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:22,681
Here.

452
00:29:25,082 --> 00:29:26,282
Oh, my.

453
00:29:27,252 --> 00:29:28,721
- It's your first time here, right?
- Yes.

454
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:29,921
I gave you extra meat.

455
00:29:30,052 --> 00:29:31,322
This is practically the deluxe size.

456
00:29:31,322 --> 00:29:33,191
I heard you were very generous.
I see that it's true.

457
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:35,092
Yes. Put some rice in it and mix them up.

458
00:29:35,092 --> 00:29:36,862
Then try adding some radish kimchi juice.

459
00:29:37,391 --> 00:29:38,631
It's to die for.

460
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:39,901
Will do. Thank you.

461
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:40,901
Enjoy.

462
00:29:57,151 --> 00:29:58,881
Thank you. Oh, right.

463
00:29:59,451 --> 00:30:00,881
It was practically the deluxe size.

464
00:30:01,221 --> 00:30:03,122
- Please keep the change.
- Thank you.

465
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:05,221
Get back safely.

466
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,762
Wait, sir.

467
00:30:08,661 --> 00:30:11,131
I watched the match where
you won the Asian Championship.

468
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:13,802
Oh, you watched my fight?

469
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:15,572
That was years ago.

470
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,941
It was around 1995, wasn't it?

471
00:30:19,272 --> 00:30:22,241
It's a famous boxing legend meme.
It's still going around on the Internet.

472
00:30:22,411 --> 00:30:23,842
Oh, is that right?

473
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:27,411
You got a KO win in Japan.

474
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:29,151
Especially at the end of the match.

475
00:30:29,151 --> 00:30:31,411
You distracted them with your left fist
and threw a hook with your right fist.

476
00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:32,582
My, that was amazing.

477
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:33,782
- I guess you box too.
- Oh, yes.

478
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:35,252
What you saw is exactly right.

479
00:30:36,052 --> 00:30:38,562
I beat them well, didn't I?

480
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:42,961
My right punch was
what got me the championship.

481
00:30:43,161 --> 00:30:45,661
Your daughter
sure got her talent from you.

482
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:47,961
I mean, her powerful right punch. My gosh.

483
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:50,032
You know about Gweon Suk too?

484
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:52,941
I really want to meet her.

485
00:30:53,572 --> 00:30:55,171
I'm a huge fan of yours and hers.

486
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:57,842
I watched her comeback match
in the stadium...

487
00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:00,241
and bought a ticket
for the upcoming match as well.

488
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:03,112
Oh, my. You really are an avid fan.

489
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:06,721
I was actually just about to head over
to the boxing gym.

490
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:09,122
Why don't you join me
if you have some time?

491
00:31:09,822 --> 00:31:11,822
Oh. May I?

492
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:23,701
My gosh. Mr. Lee.

493
00:31:24,832 --> 00:31:26,171
Here, take this. I brought you some food.

494
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,502
You're the best.

495
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:30,711
He's my customer.

496
00:31:31,112 --> 00:31:34,582
He's a true fan of mine
and Gweon Suk's fan as well.

497
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:37,012
He's a huge fan and knows a lot about her.

498
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:38,181
He wanted to meet her,

499
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:39,282
so I brought him over.

500
00:31:39,451 --> 00:31:40,451
I see.

501
00:31:40,622 --> 00:31:43,491
My gosh. Even from here,
I can see how powerful her punches are.

502
00:31:43,491 --> 00:31:45,721
I heard Han Ah Reum was injured.

503
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:47,191
She'll win
even if she fights half-heartedly.

504
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,131
She won't fight half-heartedly.

505
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:51,092
She'll do a great job and win.

506
00:31:51,731 --> 00:31:52,731
Wait and see.

507
00:31:53,032 --> 00:31:54,032
All right, then.

508
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:58,802
Suk, let's do this.

509
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:06,741
Come on!

510
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:10,082
It's back.

511
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:12,221
What's back?

512
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:13,921
That face.

513
00:32:15,151 --> 00:32:16,151
Here!

514
00:32:16,322 --> 00:32:18,151
- From Gweon Suk's prime.
- Uppercut!

515
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:19,921
That determined face.

516
00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:21,592
It's back.

517
00:32:22,032 --> 00:32:24,391
- Come on.
- Is it because of Han Ah Reum?

518
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,231
- Here.
- The stronger...

519
00:32:26,762 --> 00:32:28,302
her opponent is,

520
00:32:28,302 --> 00:32:30,971
the more determined she tends to become.

521
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:31,971
Here.

522
00:32:32,372 --> 00:32:33,372
Uppercut.

523
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:34,772
Undercut. Once more.

524
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:37,842
Come on.

525
00:32:38,211 --> 00:32:39,211
Here.

526
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:43,552
(Paran Tour)

527
00:32:48,221 --> 00:32:50,292
Gosh, you scared me.
I nearly jumped out of my skin.

528
00:32:50,951 --> 00:32:52,262
Why did you do that?

529
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:55,062
Why were you so startled?

530
00:32:55,362 --> 00:32:56,691
You must feel guilty
about a lot of things.

531
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:58,062
Come on in.

532
00:33:02,832 --> 00:33:03,832
Oh, my.

533
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,941
This used to be their office, right?

534
00:33:09,512 --> 00:33:10,512
Yes.

535
00:33:11,471 --> 00:33:12,941
Many of the offices
in the building are vacant,

536
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:14,782
so I'm renting it cheap.

537
00:33:15,881 --> 00:33:17,181
You're really something.

538
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:19,381
(Boss Nam Hyun Ki)

539
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:20,651
What is all that?

540
00:33:22,122 --> 00:33:23,122
Oh, my.

541
00:33:23,951 --> 00:33:25,622
You've done a lot of research by yourself.

542
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:27,391
You must know your enemy to catch them.

543
00:33:29,731 --> 00:33:31,491
They're monitoring the police too?

544
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:33,661
Yes. Around the clock,
from a different country.

545
00:33:34,631 --> 00:33:35,971
The moment
they see a suspicious IP address,

546
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:38,171
they destroy the website right away
and run.

547
00:33:38,171 --> 00:33:40,542
And you're going to catch them yourself?

548
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:41,842
My strategy is simple.

549
00:33:42,612 --> 00:33:44,141
Find their hiding place...

550
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:46,282
and raid them before they manage
to destroy all evidence.

551
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:48,042
How are you going to find
their hiding place?

552
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,512
It's called a hiding place for a reason.

553
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,122
I'll use bait.

554
00:33:52,752 --> 00:33:53,752
"Bait?"

555
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:57,052
Can I write a story about this?

556
00:33:59,461 --> 00:34:00,792
Okay, fine.

557
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:03,032
Anyway, who gave you this?

558
00:34:04,092 --> 00:34:05,191
Coach Yang from the Cheetahs.

559
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:09,201
He was the jerk who roped
Hee Won into match fixing.

560
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:11,671
What? So he was the broker?

561
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:14,741
My, he sure has the face of a broker.

562
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,511
I think Coach Yang...

563
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:20,911
was planning on using Ma Young Jun
in the next fixed match.

564
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:22,781
But I snatched this up.

565
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:24,111
What do you mean?

566
00:34:25,852 --> 00:34:28,891
Oh, you mean you're going to step in
and act like you're the broker?

567
00:34:28,891 --> 00:34:30,152
Is that it?

568
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,352
I've got nothing to lose.

569
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,692
I'll meet him and tail him...

570
00:34:33,692 --> 00:34:34,692
to their hiding place.

571
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:36,962
(New Message)

572
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:40,002
Who's texting you at this late hour?

573
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:43,832
Lee Gweon Suk?

574
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,741
I have to go to collect my bait.

575
00:35:02,922 --> 00:35:04,352
What was that?

576
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:06,591
Mr. Kim Tae Young.

577
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:08,891
I've heard a lot about you.

578
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:10,991
You were Hee Won's agent.

579
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:13,531
Are you pulling this stunt,

580
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:15,471
so you can insert me
into one of those rigged games?

581
00:35:15,672 --> 00:35:17,902
How dare you intimidate me
with a ridiculous rumor from the tabloid?

582
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:19,641
The tabloid?

583
00:35:19,872 --> 00:35:22,442
Didn't you play Baccarat
on November 14, 2021...

584
00:35:22,442 --> 00:35:24,341
in Macao?

585
00:35:24,442 --> 00:35:27,411
You lost 42,000 dollars to be exact.

586
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,312
This isn't from some tabloid. It's a fact.

587
00:35:32,352 --> 00:35:33,982
Should I send you a picture or something?

588
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:41,721
I only played it once. Okay?

589
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:44,091
I only played it once out of curiosity.

590
00:35:45,431 --> 00:35:48,201
- I know that.
- Then why are you doing this to me?

591
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:51,801
Can I tell you my wish?

592
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:05,721
I think this is the place.

593
00:36:12,522 --> 00:36:13,721
- Hey.
- Hey.

594
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:14,761
Hey.

595
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:18,761
What? Come on.
Hey, hold this for a second.

596
00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:25,841
Ms. Jo!

597
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:29,212
Goodness.

598
00:36:31,971 --> 00:36:33,882
Why did you keep running away?

599
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:35,411
Did you do something wrong?

600
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:39,451
Why did you come to my house?

601
00:36:40,221 --> 00:36:43,752
Wait. You're not sick or anything, right?

602
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:45,391
Are you on the run?

603
00:36:45,562 --> 00:36:47,591
Is it a stalker? Or a creditor?

604
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:49,861
Don't tell me
you're running away from the police.

605
00:36:53,732 --> 00:36:55,232
- I...
- You...

606
00:36:55,232 --> 00:36:56,902
- don't...
- don't...

607
00:37:00,272 --> 00:37:02,672
Gosh, I don't have any makeup on.

608
00:37:07,611 --> 00:37:08,841
(Deep-fried donuts in water and oil
are tasty.)

609
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:10,611
Order anything you like, sir.

610
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:12,582
Gosh, I told you it was my treat.

611
00:37:14,051 --> 00:37:15,622
Did you bring us to your part-time job?

612
00:37:15,922 --> 00:37:18,051
You stopped me on my way
to my part-time job.

613
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:20,422
These are affordable and tasty donuts.

614
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:23,292
So this is a win-win situation.
You know, like a marriage in harmony.

615
00:37:24,062 --> 00:37:25,161
A marriage in harmony?

616
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:27,402
Is that the right analogy here?

617
00:37:27,402 --> 00:37:29,971
Anyway, just pick the donut you want.

618
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:39,442
The menu here is quite extensive.

619
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,781
I recommend the hot Americano...

620
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:43,652
and...

621
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:45,752
the donuts too.

622
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:51,221
It smells nice.

623
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:55,391
Everyone knows
donuts and coffee are the best pairing.

624
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:58,132
- I'm good.
- Try it.

625
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:06,372
It's nice and crispy.

626
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:13,781
What's this?

627
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,582
Wait.

628
00:38:16,882 --> 00:38:18,051
That's...

629
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:21,281
Are you switching over to MMA?

630
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:22,692
What?

631
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:25,221
I just took it because he gave it to me.

632
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:27,391
So you're not leaving?

633
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:29,031
I'm not.

634
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:31,861
Why not? The sport suits you.

635
00:38:32,332 --> 00:38:34,962
My dear, I'm a boxer.

636
00:38:36,172 --> 00:38:37,632
Why are you trying to kick me out?

637
00:38:38,872 --> 00:38:39,971
I'm not leaving.

638
00:38:40,341 --> 00:38:42,942
Gosh. I'm not kicking you out.

639
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:44,442
Then how come you haven't been at the gym?

640
00:38:45,272 --> 00:38:49,982
Oh, that? My former coach
opened up a boxed meal store.

641
00:38:50,281 --> 00:38:51,312
He delivers the boxed meals now.

642
00:38:52,051 --> 00:38:54,781
I've been helping him out there
because he's understaffed.

643
00:38:55,821 --> 00:38:57,422
You should have called then.

644
00:38:59,161 --> 00:39:00,491
You came...

645
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:02,732
because I didn't.

646
00:39:07,402 --> 00:39:08,431
Gosh.

647
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:22,712
You're here.

648
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:26,681
- Goodness, hello.
- Hello.

649
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:28,522
Come and sit down.

650
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:31,292
Let's go.

651
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:37,232
Gosh. All right.

652
00:39:38,062 --> 00:39:40,261
My father went home early today.

653
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:41,431
I'm undermanned as you can see.

654
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:43,602
Gosh. Take this.

655
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:45,942
It's an honor to meet you.

656
00:39:46,502 --> 00:39:47,542
Sure.

657
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:51,571
Gosh. This is some valuable hand
I'm shaking right now.

658
00:39:57,551 --> 00:39:58,852
Okay. Let's drink.

659
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:01,752
Gosh, no.

660
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:06,122
Let me.

661
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:10,431
Gosh.

662
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:15,261
Goodness.

663
00:40:15,261 --> 00:40:18,301
I had no idea he was hiding
an amazing athlete like you.

664
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:19,942
Goodness. Who would have known?

665
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:22,942
By the way,
I didn't read any news articles that...

666
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:24,741
you signed with S and P.

667
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:30,411
We're still sorting out the conditions
of the contract.

668
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:31,752
I see.

669
00:40:33,522 --> 00:40:37,491
Mr. Ma.
What I want from you is very simple.

670
00:40:37,922 --> 00:40:41,091
I just hope we can stay friends
for a very long time.

671
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:44,161
Sure.

672
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:45,562
Dig in.

673
00:40:57,471 --> 00:40:58,641
This is it, right?

674
00:41:02,551 --> 00:41:04,681
You said one meeting.
That's why I came out here tonight.

675
00:41:04,982 --> 00:41:06,022
Keep your promise.

676
00:41:08,982 --> 00:41:10,051
This probably...

677
00:41:11,192 --> 00:41:12,292
won't be the end.

678
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,962
- What?
- Tell your club the truth.

679
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,591
You might have been lucky
to dodge this one.

680
00:41:19,132 --> 00:41:20,462
But it will catch up with you someday.

681
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:26,902
You might end up
ruining your entire life...

682
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,442
at the expense
of trying to cover up one small mistake.

683
00:41:30,942 --> 00:41:32,172
Just like Kim Hee Won.

684
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:34,841
This is your first time.

685
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:38,011
If you go to them first,
your disciplinary action won't be severe.

686
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:39,982
If you need someone to talk about this...

687
00:41:39,982 --> 00:41:41,252
I'll take care of this.

688
00:43:10,442 --> 00:43:11,872
What are you doing
in the middle of the night?

689
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:14,542
Hey, I'm trying to plant strawberries...

690
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:16,611
and a few other things.

691
00:43:16,852 --> 00:43:18,482
Come on. Don't just stand there.

692
00:43:18,582 --> 00:43:20,652
Why don't you help me plant them?

693
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:23,221
Here. It's quite fun.

694
00:43:24,451 --> 00:43:25,522
Put on the gloves.

695
00:43:39,002 --> 00:43:40,071
Dad.

696
00:43:41,672 --> 00:43:43,841
What do people do when they retire?

697
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:46,141
That was random.

698
00:43:46,882 --> 00:43:48,181
Just focus on your match.

699
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:49,982
Are you thinking about retiring?

700
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:52,252
I'm just curious. That's all.

701
00:43:53,022 --> 00:43:54,221
I wonder what they all do.

702
00:43:54,721 --> 00:43:57,321
What's Min Guk up to?
He won the Korean championships.

703
00:43:57,422 --> 00:43:59,122
Right. Min Guk?

704
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,931
Min Guk retired and became
an international boxing referee.

705
00:44:03,491 --> 00:44:05,531
I see. That's good for him.

706
00:44:12,602 --> 00:44:13,641
What about Yeon Kyung?

707
00:44:19,442 --> 00:44:21,442
Yeon Kyung...

708
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:25,781
Come on. Enough with the suspense.

709
00:44:27,622 --> 00:44:29,792
Why are you so impatient?
I wonder where you get that from.

710
00:44:29,951 --> 00:44:31,922
If you're curious, go see her yourself.

711
00:44:36,531 --> 00:44:37,562
I see.

712
00:45:17,931 --> 00:45:19,232
Sorry.

716
00:46:40,196 --> 00:46:41,196
Hey.

717
00:46:43,565 --> 00:46:45,536
You look just the same.

718
00:46:50,306 --> 00:46:52,176
How's Coach?

719
00:46:53,335 --> 00:46:54,346
I don't know.

720
00:46:55,005 --> 00:46:56,505
He's changed a bit.

721
00:46:57,476 --> 00:46:58,476
He's older.

722
00:46:58,616 --> 00:46:59,815
And weaker.

723
00:47:00,016 --> 00:47:01,016
Is he really?

724
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:06,085
I can't imagine. He was so fierce.

725
00:47:06,985 --> 00:47:09,226
Do you like being in graduate school?

726
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:11,056
It's crazy tough.

727
00:47:11,056 --> 00:47:13,096
I played sports my whole life
and never studied.

728
00:47:15,025 --> 00:47:16,025
Hang on.

729
00:47:21,766 --> 00:47:22,935
I got my Grade Two license...

730
00:47:22,935 --> 00:47:24,105
and am working on Grade One.

731
00:47:24,605 --> 00:47:25,735
I'm a freelancer right now...

732
00:47:25,735 --> 00:47:27,375
and consult teenagers mainly.

733
00:47:28,605 --> 00:47:29,775
You can tell me anything.

734
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:31,915
Are you seeing someone?

735
00:47:32,645 --> 00:47:33,645
I can help with that too.

736
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,795
Can I sit here?

737
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:51,996
My ear. This side works better.

738
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:57,676
Gweon Suk. I'm fine.

739
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:01,446
I'm sorry.

740
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,915
I wanted to apologize one day.

741
00:48:07,516 --> 00:48:08,985
I'm okay.

742
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:11,915
It was just my luck.

743
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,926
After I became hard of hearing
and quit boxing,

744
00:48:16,585 --> 00:48:18,426
I felt for a while
that my dreams were crushed.

745
00:48:19,326 --> 00:48:22,065
But I'm really okay now.

746
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:25,036
Because I can't hear too well,

747
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:27,366
I try harder to listen to what others say.

748
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:31,576
As a psychologist and consultant,
that's a good thing.

749
00:48:33,705 --> 00:48:34,705
Yeon Kyung.

750
00:48:36,105 --> 00:48:37,116
Thank you.

751
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:39,716
For making a comeback...

752
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,016
and for coming to see me.

753
00:48:43,415 --> 00:48:44,786
After you disappeared,

754
00:48:45,485 --> 00:48:47,156
I felt guilty for a long time...

755
00:48:47,156 --> 00:48:49,025
because I thought it was my fault.

756
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:52,496
So to be honest,

757
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:55,496
I was so pleased
when I heard of your return.

758
00:48:57,136 --> 00:49:00,196
I finally felt
I could be free of the guilt.

759
00:49:01,665 --> 00:49:02,665
Isn't that funny?

760
00:49:04,505 --> 00:49:05,505
From now on,

761
00:49:06,136 --> 00:49:07,576
let's not feel bad for each other.

762
00:49:08,676 --> 00:49:09,676
Okay?

763
00:49:16,585 --> 00:49:18,656
There's something I can only tell you.

764
00:49:20,116 --> 00:49:21,585
I'm going to retire.

765
00:49:22,685 --> 00:49:24,025
The upcoming title match...

766
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:25,726
will be my last.

767
00:49:27,795 --> 00:49:28,795
I see.

768
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:31,096
I really wanted to see you...

769
00:49:32,335 --> 00:49:34,036
before going into the ring.

770
00:49:35,466 --> 00:49:36,466
Thanks a lot.

771
00:49:38,406 --> 00:49:40,375
I can no longer compete as a boxer,

772
00:49:40,806 --> 00:49:42,306
but I still love the sport.

773
00:49:44,676 --> 00:49:46,116
I wish you the best of luck.

774
00:49:46,346 --> 00:49:47,346
I'll come and watch.

775
00:49:48,045 --> 00:49:49,216
Do your best.

776
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:52,016

Didn't I tell you
to stay away from Gweon Suk?

00:50:34,466 --> 00:50:35,565
Why did you come here?

782
00:50:36,696 --> 00:50:37,696
I should just...

783
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:40,235
No. Wait.

784
00:50:43,065 --> 00:50:44,076
You're mistaken.

785
00:50:54,286 --> 00:50:55,946
I'm anxious myself.

786
00:50:56,985 --> 00:50:57,985
Okay?

787
00:51:00,386 --> 00:51:01,855
Because of Kim Hee Won,

788
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:05,426
you have no idea
how angry the chairman is.

789
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:08,096
He almost killed me.

790
00:51:08,426 --> 00:51:10,196
If this match doesn't go as planned,

791
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:12,966
he'll throw me out for good.

792
00:51:14,435 --> 00:51:15,665
He'll bury me in the mountains.

793
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:17,935
I'll say this one more time.

794
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:20,406
Stay well away from Gweon Suk's match.

795
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:23,275
And from her too.

796
00:51:23,976 --> 00:51:25,476
Do you think I can do that?

797
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:27,516
Seriously?

798
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:30,185
Do you even know how much money
people have bet...

799
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:31,216
on this match?

800
00:51:32,286 --> 00:51:33,656
There's no going back now.

801
00:51:35,886 --> 00:51:37,826
If Gweon Suk wins this match,

802
00:51:38,855 --> 00:51:40,355
I'll really end up dead.

That's your problem.

804
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:51,435

805
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:52,676
Stand up straight.

806

to stay away from Gweon Suk's match.

I'll cancel the match, okay?

809

Do you get it?

00:52:10,426 --> 00:52:11,426
Yes, I do.

811
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:14,196
I'll tell the chairman.

812
00:52:15,096 --> 00:52:16,295
Will that do?

813
00:52:17,366 --> 00:52:18,366
Do it properly.

Just fight me, Ah Reum.

821

That champion belt.

822
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:45,755
I know how precious it is to you.

823
00:53:46,955 --> 00:53:48,056
So fight me.

824
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:09,676
I won't hide...

825
00:54:10,105 --> 00:54:11,476
or run away.

826
00:54:13,446 --> 00:54:15,786
I'll show everyone...

827
00:54:16,446 --> 00:54:19,585
which one of us will remain in the ring
until the end. Me...

828
00:54:20,755 --> 00:54:21,786
or Lee Gweon Suk.

829
00:54:28,996 --> 00:54:30,096
Ah Reum, what are you doing?

830
00:54:31,966 --> 00:54:33,395
Finish up quickly. Let's go home.

831
00:54:33,636 --> 00:54:34,966
Oh, I'm sorry.

832
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,105
Hey.

833
00:54:41,775 --> 00:54:42,775
What are you doing here?

834
00:54:43,806 --> 00:54:44,915
Are you stalking me?

835
00:54:55,656 --> 00:54:57,726
I came to talk to you about something.

836
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:00,895
I have nothing to talk to you about.

837
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:03,795
I...

838
00:55:05,295 --> 00:55:06,795
want to beat you.

839
00:55:09,835 --> 00:55:11,935
I'll beat you,
so you'd better be prepared.

840
00:55:14,946 --> 00:55:16,906
Did you come all the way here to say that?

841
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,746
Honestly, you are really something.

842
00:55:23,985 --> 00:55:25,616
Don't be all talk.

843
00:55:26,516 --> 00:55:28,286
Prove it with your punches
once in the ring.

844
00:55:30,656 --> 00:55:31,795
Thanks, Ah Reum.

845
00:55:33,355 --> 00:55:34,366
For what?

846
00:55:36,895 --> 00:55:38,036
Just something. You don't need to know.

847
00:55:40,735 --> 00:55:41,806
I'll beat you...

848
00:55:42,866 --> 00:55:45,505
in the ring with my punches.

849
00:55:48,246 --> 00:55:49,306
Challenge accepted.

850
00:56:13,096 --> 00:56:15,235
The police arrested a group of men...

851
00:56:15,235 --> 00:56:17,676
who raked in over 47 million dollars...

852
00:56:17,676 --> 00:56:19,705
through an illegal sports betting site.

853
00:56:19,705 --> 00:56:21,605
The bets made on the site
in the past two years...

854
00:56:21,605 --> 00:56:23,545
reach 420 million dollars in total.

855
00:56:23,545 --> 00:56:25,576
It has been revealed
that they even used...

856
00:56:25,576 --> 00:56:28,685
cryptocurrency exchanges
in order to avoid police radar.

857
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:30,955
The police found
hundreds of dollars in cash...

858
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:32,955
in the home and car of Mr. Kim,
the ringleader.

859
00:56:32,955 --> 00:56:34,726
My, look at all the cash.

860
00:56:39,795 --> 00:56:40,926
Why did you turn it off?

861
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,696
The police caught them
thanks to your tip-off.

862
00:56:42,895 --> 00:56:44,696
They haven't caught all of them.

863
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,065
Who? Nam Hyun Ki?

864
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:48,605
I'm sure
the police will track him down too.

865
00:56:49,466 --> 00:56:51,536
But they caught his main henchman.

866
00:56:51,536 --> 00:56:52,875
Kim Oh Bok has been arrested, you know.

867
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:56,746
It may not have been a deadly punch,
but you got them good.

868
00:57:00,775 --> 00:57:02,645
When's your interview with the police?

869
00:57:04,016 --> 00:57:05,085
The day of the match.

870
00:57:29,275 --> 00:57:30,275
Mister.

871
00:57:31,446 --> 00:57:34,076
You'll come and watch me fight, right?

872
00:57:35,616 --> 00:57:37,915
It might be my last match ever, you know.

873
00:57:40,286 --> 00:57:42,485
Yes, of course. I should be there.

874
00:57:43,286 --> 00:57:46,496
You said
you were going to put bandages on me.

875
00:57:47,156 --> 00:57:48,266
You haven't forgotten that either, right?

876
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:51,335
Right, I haven't.

877
00:57:52,395 --> 00:57:53,696
I've made up my mind.

878
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:58,605
I'm not going to think
about losing my match.

879
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,076
For you.

880
00:58:02,275 --> 00:58:04,676
For everyone who's rooting for me.

881
00:58:06,076 --> 00:58:07,685
And more importantly, for myself.

882
00:58:11,786 --> 00:58:12,855
I'll do my best to win.

883
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:16,556
All right.

884
00:58:42,616 --> 00:58:43,685
I'll be off, then.

885
00:58:45,085 --> 00:58:46,116
Okay.

886
00:59:31,335 --> 00:59:32,335
Mister.

887
00:59:37,466 --> 00:59:39,005
I like you.

888
00:59:40,976 --> 00:59:43,105
My heart flutters when I'm with you.

889
00:59:46,976 --> 00:59:48,846
I want to see you when you're not around,

890
00:59:51,386 --> 00:59:53,786
and my heart aches when I see you upset.

891
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:00,955
I don't care
even if you don't like me back.

892
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,096
It's just how I feel.

893
01:00:06,724 --> 01:00:07,924
I've decided...

894
01:00:08,966 --> 01:00:10,665
not to deceive myself anymore.

895
01:00:12,935 --> 01:00:15,205
I felt like I'd never get to tell you
if not now.

896
01:00:19,145 --> 01:00:20,176
I like you,

897
01:00:21,746 --> 01:00:22,786
mister.

898
01:00:34,156 --> 01:00:36,766
(My Lovely Boxer)

899
01:00:55,315 --> 01:00:57,645
(Champion Ox Bone Soup)

900
01:00:58,716 --> 01:01:01,355
You two care for Gweon Suk, right?

901
01:01:01,355 --> 01:01:03,226
- Obviously.
- Exactly.

902
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:07,156
All right, then.

903
01:01:09,096 --> 01:01:11,895
Then let me ask you a favor, man to man.

904
01:01:14,665 --> 01:01:16,435
- Mr. Lee, you take care of her food.
- Got it.

905
01:01:17,335 --> 01:01:18,375
And you're in charge of roadwork.

906
01:01:25,946 --> 01:01:27,145
For Lee Gweon Suk.

907
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:28,446
- We got this!
- We got this!

908
01:01:37,996 --> 01:01:39,226
Let's do this!

909
01:01:39,226 --> 01:01:40,656
- Yes!
- Yes!

910
01:01:40,656 --> 01:01:41,696
We'll show them.

911
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:43,696
Let's go!

912
01:01:45,096 --> 01:01:47,165
- What?
- The thing is,

913
01:01:47,735 --> 01:01:50,766
Gweon Suk told me to leave.
She said she wanted to jog alone.

914
01:01:50,766 --> 01:01:52,406
You can't leave
just because she told you to.

915
01:01:52,406 --> 01:01:54,576
Are you an idiot?
Go back there at once and run with her.

916
01:01:55,906 --> 01:01:56,906
Okay.

917
01:02:00,716 --> 01:02:02,145
You said you were going back to bed.

918
01:02:02,946 --> 01:02:05,685
Well, I suddenly felt wide-awake
on my way home.

919
01:02:07,455 --> 01:02:10,355
As for the chicken breast,
it has to be exactly 200g.

920
01:02:10,585 --> 01:02:13,395
Okay, 200g. Hold on.

921
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:17,295
Yes, it's exactly 200g. What else?

922
01:02:18,065 --> 01:02:19,996
She likes cherry tomatoes,

923
01:02:19,996 --> 01:02:21,366
so make sure to put in some fresh ones.

924
01:02:22,036 --> 01:02:23,235
Okay, no problem.

925
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,855
Why are your eyes all puffy?

926
01:02:42,955 --> 01:02:44,656
It's not like you'll let someone hit you.

927
01:02:45,355 --> 01:02:47,895
- Are you feeling sick?
- I'm heartbroken!

928
01:02:48,025 --> 01:02:50,696
You only know a few guys, so...

929
01:02:51,565 --> 01:02:53,266
What? Don't tell me it's...

930
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,705
Mister.

931
01:02:54,705 --> 01:02:57,466
You have to comfort me this time too.

932
01:02:57,835 --> 01:02:59,536
What if I lose?

933
01:02:59,536 --> 01:03:02,476
A loser who does their best
never looks like a coward.

934
01:03:02,605 --> 01:03:03,676
Don't worry.

935
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:07,415
Do you know what's more important
than the end result in sports?

936
01:03:07,946 --> 01:03:09,016
The process.

937
01:03:09,216 --> 01:03:10,786
So you must pay for it.

938
01:03:12,786 --> 01:03:14,185
You have to watch me, okay?

939
01:03:14,926 --> 01:03:16,355
It's my last match.

940
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:19,926
I'll watch it until the end
no matter where I am.

941
01:03:20,955 --> 01:03:23,570
