00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:05,472
(My Lovely Boxer)

2
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:19,116
Mister.

3
00:00:22,927 --> 00:00:24,427
I like you.

4
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:29,767
I felt like I'd never get to tell you
if not now.

5
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:33,566
I like you,

6
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:35,767
mister.

7
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:46,447
I like you too...

8
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:50,846
because you're my athlete.

9
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:59,057
Is that the only reason you have?

10
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,697
Let me assure you.

11
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:10,367
You'll regret this later.

12
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:17,246
You'll soon regret why you said
you liked someone like me...

13
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:21,216
once you meet a man you really like.

14
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:24,486
- So...
- Even so.

15
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:27,917
You're the man I like right now.

16
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:31,886
You must have forgotten already.

17
00:01:34,197 --> 00:01:36,296
It's better for you
if you stay away from me.

18
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:38,367
I'm a bad guy. Remember?

19
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:41,097
I approached you because of money.

20
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,667
I used you all this time.

21
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:49,776
Is that the only thing you wanted to do?

22
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:54,117
Are you sure?

23
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:00,486
Even if that's the case,

24
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:02,386
I don't care.

25
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:05,126
Remember what you told me?

26
00:02:06,897 --> 00:02:08,656
You told me to give it my all...

27
00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:12,097
and not to leave any regrets in the ring.

28
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:15,067
That's why I made up my mind...

29
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:18,236
to win the match...

30
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,736
and to like you, so there were no regrets.

31
00:02:25,507 --> 00:02:26,616
So...

32
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:29,187
just...

33
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:32,116
let me like you.

34
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:36,386
That's all I need.

35
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:41,326
Don't push me away.

36
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:44,866
I want you to nag me like before,

37
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:46,167
so I can whine.

38
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,366
That's all I ask.

39
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:52,336
Okay?

40
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:03,247
I'll get going now.

41
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:18,157
("Love will find a way."
From a British proverb)

42
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:22,767
(Episode 11)

43
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:33,777
I told you not to collect my laundry.

44
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,946
I didn't know when you were coming home.

45
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:41,816
If you leave them overnight,
they will get damp.

46
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,316
Even so. Just leave them here.

47
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:45,417
I'll take care of my own laundry.

48
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,087
Gosh. Okay.

49
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:51,686
Why are your eyes all puffy?

50
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:53,397
Did you cry?

51
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:54,996
I didn't cry.

52
00:04:55,657 --> 00:04:56,667
I think you did.

53
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:58,126
Let me see.

54
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,227
Come on.

55
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:00,537
Look at that.

56
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:02,566
You did cry. Why did you cry?

57
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,506
It's not like you'll let someone hit you.

58
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,407
Are you feeling sick?

59
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,647
Yes, a bit.

60
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:12,376
What's wrong with you? Is it an injury?

61
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,977
How did you get hurt?

62
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,087
I'm heartbroken!

63
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:40,806
So you broke up with that guy,
Han Jae Min.

64
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,147
How did you find out?

65
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,046
"I have..."

66
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:51,686
"had a boyfriend."

67
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:55,657
"It was short,
and it was both bitter and sweet."

68
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:58,856
You told the entire country
about your romantic relationship.

69
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,397
That's enough.

70
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,027
Where did you watch that interview?

71
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:08,066
Did he say something to you?

72
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,296
Like what?

73
00:06:09,296 --> 00:06:10,306
Yes, he did.

74
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:13,176
Gosh. I'm going to kill that jerk.

75
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,847
Goodness.
You're jumping to conclusions again.

76
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:18,847
No?

77
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:21,017
You aren't injured
and it's not about Han Jae Min.

78
00:06:23,446 --> 00:06:25,917
As for your social circle,

79
00:06:26,256 --> 00:06:27,256
you have your coach.

80
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,056
Hey, is it Kim...

81
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,027
Stop it there.

82
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,397
Don't cross the line.

83
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:36,996
You keep trying to act like a dad.

84
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:58,417
You're late today.

85
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:00,256
Did you oversleep?

86
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:02,926
I woke up early.

87
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:05,186
But I wasn't sure
if I should join you or not.

88
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:07,296
Whatever.

89
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:09,467
Or is it because your body is aching?

90
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:11,227
My legs are aching.

91
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:14,097
It feels like
I'm deceiving you every morning.

92
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:15,267
So there's tension in my stomach.

93
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,066
You're deceiving me?

94
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:19,506
What is it?

95
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,106
Actually,

96
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,847
I'm here because
your agent asked me to join you.

97
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:29,077
He asked you to do this?

98
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:31,946
Yes.

99
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:32,957
For Lee Gweon Suk.

100
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:33,957
- We got this!
- We got this!

101
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,287
Let's do this!

102
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:36,527
- Yes!
- Yes!

103
00:07:36,686 --> 00:07:37,686
We'll show them.

104
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:39,356
Let's go!

105
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:48,637
You didn't have to do this
just because he asked.

106
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:51,137
Why are you doing this?

107
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:54,077
You're making me feel bad.

108
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:56,347
You don't have to feel bad.

109
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:58,176
This was my decision.

110
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:02,777
Whether it was voluntary or not,

111
00:08:04,446 --> 00:08:06,887
I wanted to do something
for the person I liked.

112
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:09,957
Jae Min.

113
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:14,056
I don't have any romantic feelings
for you now.

114
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:17,926
I know that too. I messed everything up.

115
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:20,537
That's just how I feel.

116
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,467
So no pressure.

117
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,736
You're okay with that, right?

118
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:27,436
We're in the same boat.

119
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:29,907
What? What do you mean?

120
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:31,676
You don't have to know.

121
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,046
All right.

122
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,017
Interlock your arms.

123
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:48,596
Come on.

124
00:08:57,907 --> 00:08:58,907
Hey.

125
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,936
So we can stretch together.

126
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:04,277
I see. To stretch. Okay.

127
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:09,476
Here it goes.

128
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:43,417
Starting today, you'll be
on a salt-free diet for a week.

129
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,816
(If you don't eat it because
it's not tasty, you'll get constipated.)

130
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:50,926
If you want to cry, eat while you cry.

131
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:53,127
You can't afford to lose muscle mass.

132
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:08,607
(Lee Gweon Suk)

133
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:12,546
This isn't tasty.

134
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:17,446
But I will still try to enjoy it.

135
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:00,127
Send me Gweon Suk's exclusive interview
before you print it.

136
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,096
Why? Are you afraid I wrote crap?

137
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:06,537
You're restricting my freedom of speech.

138
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,096
I need to check. Are you free tomorrow?

139
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:11,267
I'll let you off this time
because you gave me a huge lead.

140
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,176
Did you see Kim Oh Bok's photo online?

141
00:11:15,436 --> 00:11:16,476
Kim Oh Bok?

142
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:18,576
I didn't.

143
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:20,946
Authorities are starting to
release information about criminals,

144
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,917
and he happened to be number one.

145
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:23,987
It's my gift to you.

146
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:41,167
Well...

147
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:44,267
Just call me Mr. Kim.

148
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:46,976
Sky Sports?

149
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,917
Good shot!

150
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:04,556
I see why you were a pro.

151
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:06,997
Nice shot.

152
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:10,726
Thank you.

153
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,137
Who are you?

154
00:12:14,336 --> 00:12:15,497
We haven't met.

155
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,737
I run this place.

156
00:12:18,507 --> 00:12:19,607
I see.

157
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:21,836
I'm a regular here,

158
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:23,247
and we haven't met.

159
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:25,877
Weren't you on the professional circuit?

160
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:28,046
She's Jung Soo Yeon, right?

161
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:30,316
Yes, that's me.

162
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:32,046
You have a good memory.

163
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:33,757
I was a huge fan.

164
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:35,357
You're an agent now, right?

165
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:37,586
Yes. I have been for a few years.

166
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:38,787
I read about that.

167
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:41,997
You have an important event.
Boxing title match.

168
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:44,726
Hey, since you're a fan of hers,

169
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,226
you could sponsor the match.

170
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:47,836
Come on.

171
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:50,737
What's wrong? I'm doing your sales job.

172
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,637
She's looking for someone
to sponsor Han Ah Reum.

173
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:55,137
She's the world champion.

174
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:58,507
Hey, I hope you win the match.
I really do.

175
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:00,216
- Here's my card.
- Thank you.

176
00:13:02,946 --> 00:13:04,487
I hope we can get closer.

177
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:06,446
Have a good time.

178
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:07,556
- Okay.
- Okay.

179
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:11,027
He must be loaded.

180
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:13,956
I wish he'd sponsor you.

181
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:15,897
Right?

182
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:19,667
He looks strangely familiar.

183
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:21,367
Does he?

184
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,336
(Chairman Nam Hyun Ki, The Sky)

185
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:33,747
Kim, what is it?

186
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:37,617
Right now?

187
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:44,556
What? Who caused his death?

188
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:46,157
All of us.

189
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,257
All of us?

190
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:02,936
All this is true?

191
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:05,676
You should've
told the company first if this was...

192
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:09,716
No. You should've come to me.

193
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:11,487
What's all this now?

194
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:13,617
I thought I could handle it myself.

195
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,157
I don't deserve to be an agent.

196
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:21,726
So what?

197
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,226
What will you do?

198
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:25,796
Turn myself in.

199
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:29,596
Say the company
acknowledged my criminal activity...

200
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,507
and fired me.

201
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:38,306
Well,

202
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,517
let's put the past aside.

203
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,046
Let's make something else clear.

204
00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:48,357
Lee Gweon Suk's match.
That's not rigged, is it?

205
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:52,956
It's not.

206
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:58,167
However, after this match,

207
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:00,767
she will retire.

208
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:04,007
What? Not that again.

209
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,466
Why would you force that on her?

210
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:10,176
She wants it more than anything.

211
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:17,487
She said she was unhappy in the ring.

212
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:19,816
Who are we...

213
00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:22,257
to make her fight?

214
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,956
We can't do that.

215
00:15:27,997 --> 00:15:28,997
Okay, fine.

216
00:15:31,926 --> 00:15:33,027
I'll talk to HR...

217
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,137
about your dismissal.

218
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:51,387
What's that?

219
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:53,387
- Is it for me?
- It's for Suk.

220
00:15:53,857 --> 00:15:54,917
Suk.

221
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,357
She's all he cares about.

222
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,456
Coach, get me a sparring partner.

223
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,367
- A partner?
- Yes.

224
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:06,566
Someone with professional experience.

225
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:08,497
Ah Reum fought 16 matches...

226
00:16:08,497 --> 00:16:09,867
and I fought zero.

227
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:11,907
Okay, I'll look.

228
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:15,476
I'm not sure if I can
now that the match is so close.

229
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,446
- Suk, this...
- A man's fine too.

230
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,517
Say I'll travel
to whatever city they're in.

231
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:25,117
Okay.

232
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:31,157
(Fighting Spirit)

233
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,186
What do you think?

234
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:36,357
Why did you get me this?
I could wear my old robe.

235
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:38,426
Why waste money?

236
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:40,466
It's to make us feel good.

237
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,237
It's your fourth defense match.

238
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:44,706
You should dress
like the champion you are.

239
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:48,007
My daughter asks
for new clothes each season.

240
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,176
I can get you one new robe.

241
00:16:55,277 --> 00:16:57,117
Hey.

242
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:02,086
Seriously, Coach, how could you?

243
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:04,186
What did I do?

244
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:07,127
Who are you to ruin this emotional moment?

245
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:09,456
You should do some PR.

246
00:17:09,756 --> 00:17:10,897
This match...

247
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,637
is our best chance to turn a profit.

248
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,167
Turn around.

249
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:18,006
"Giant."

250
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:22,077
"New members wanted." Plaster that here.

251
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:25,006
You're out of your mind.

252
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:28,216
It's a WBC world champion match.

253
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:29,847
That would make her look bad.

254
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,756
Dear friend. Coach is right about that.

255
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:35,216
That's not right.

256
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,756
If we're going to do some PR,

257
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,127
shouldn't we put our number here too?

258
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:43,226
- What?
- That's genius.

259
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,797
Your mind works in different ways.

260
00:17:48,397 --> 00:17:50,206
Coach, she'll do fine.

261
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,637
- Let's see.
- Isn't it cool?

262
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,637
Hey, are you free to talk?

263
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,976
What is it? I can't talk for long.

264
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:04,847
It won't take long.

265
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:05,847
Suk, come here.

266
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:08,857
(Talking to: Choi Ho Joong)

267
00:18:08,857 --> 00:18:10,016
Show him.

268
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:13,057
It looks weird.

269
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:14,557
Come on.

270
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:17,426
Mister, don't laugh.

271
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:23,706
(The place to diet, Emperor Diet Boxing)

272
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:24,766
It's awesome.

273
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:29,807
See? He laughed!

274
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:32,307
Neither of you get what I'm doing.

275
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:33,547
I do know.

276
00:18:33,716 --> 00:18:35,516
You're all about making money.

277
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:36,776
I am not.

278
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:40,486
Where are you, Mister?

279
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:42,087
Can you come and stop him?

280
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,157
I don't need stopping.

281
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:44,627
Tae Young, you needn't come.

282
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:48,357
Mister, can I really wear
something stupid like this?

283
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:50,627
What? It's stupid?

284
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,127
I can't come over right now.

285
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,067
Sort it out yourselves.

286
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:55,966
- I have to go.
- Okay.

287
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:20,196
Whatever Gweon Suk decides,

288
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,256
please be there for her.

289
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:25,367
Why are your eyes all puffy? Did you cry?

290
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:26,797
How did you get hurt?

291
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:29,196
I'm heartbroken!

292
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,676
You're here.

293
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:40,776
Yes.

294
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:42,976
Sit down.

295
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:56,456
Something was bothering me,

296
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,026
so I decided to ask you about it.

297
00:20:01,436 --> 00:20:02,466
Ask me?

298
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:05,006
You like Gweon Suk, don't you?

299
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:12,377
Why are you copying me?

300
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,547
Or course, I like her. I represent her.

301
00:20:15,877 --> 00:20:17,817
Not like that, fool.

302
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,286
No.

303
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:27,057
No?

304
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:30,667
Good, then.

305
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,436
Hey, man to man... No.

306
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,776
Let me ask you a favor
as Gweon Suk's father.

307
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:45,907
Gweon Suk is still young...

308
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:48,647
and doesn't understand
how the world works yet.

309
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:50,786
I'm saying this just in case.

310
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:53,516
If you ever sense that Gweon Suk
is developing feelings for you,

311
00:20:54,456 --> 00:20:56,087
I trust you'll take care of it
in a wise manner.

312
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,567
You know why I brought this up, right?

313
00:21:12,936 --> 00:21:13,936
Yes, I know.

314
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:16,137
All right, then.

315
00:21:17,047 --> 00:21:18,047
Finish your drink.

316
00:21:36,857 --> 00:21:38,167
None of the guys wants to do it either?

317
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:41,567
My gosh. Who knew it'd be this hard
to find her sparring partner?

318
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:44,266
Oh, boy. All right.

319
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,407
The thought of having to fight Gweon Suk
makes them uncomfortable.

320
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:48,976
All right.
You'll come to the match, right?

321
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:51,877
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

322
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:57,417
Oh, boy.

323
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:02,387
Coach, I'm off.

324
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:04,426
Hey, you stayed late today.

325
00:22:05,226 --> 00:22:06,726
Don't practice too hard.

326
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,327
A KO win in the first round
would be too boring.

327
00:22:09,756 --> 00:22:12,327
Oh, shall we head out together?
I'll take you home.

328
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,196
I'm going to run home.
Will you run with me?

329
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:21,077
All right, then. Get home safely.

330
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:27,417
May I help you?

331
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:30,347
I noticed that your lights were still on.
Are you still open?

332
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:32,387
Take a seat.

333
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:34,087
Thank you.

334
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,127
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

335
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:44,827
You can't close up because of me.

336
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:47,837
Gosh, don't you worry.
Take your time and enjoy the food.

337
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:50,506
By the way,

338
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,107
you look weary,

339
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:54,307
compared to the last time I saw you.

340
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:55,536
Something happened.

341
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,776
A business partner I had trusted
betrayed me.

342
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:02,446
Oh, no. I see.

343
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:05,647
Eat as much as you'd like.
I hope the food cheers you up.

344
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:09,317
Here, soju is on the house.

345
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:10,926
Gosh, thank you.

346
00:23:11,186 --> 00:23:12,426
- No problem. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

347
00:23:14,797 --> 00:23:15,797
Hello.

348
00:23:17,026 --> 00:23:18,766
Hey, what brings you here
at this late hour?

349
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:21,097
Did something happen to Gweon Suk?

350
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:22,567
No, it's not that.

351
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,506
I have a favor to ask.

352
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:28,107
Don't tell Suk though.

353
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:33,107
She'll flip out if she finds out
that I came here to see you.

354
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:34,577
What is it?

355
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,746
Suk wants a sparring session,

356
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,887
but I can't find anyone who'd do it.

357
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:42,016
Can you think of anyone...

358
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:43,857
who'd be up for it among those you taught?

359
00:23:44,186 --> 00:23:46,186
Hey, I taught many boxers,

360
00:23:46,887 --> 00:23:48,926
but I can't really think of
any female boxer who could handle her.

361
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:52,097
Besides, most of them have retired.

362
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:53,966
Hold on.

363
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:55,597
Let me see.

364
00:23:57,867 --> 00:23:58,867
Well...

365
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,837
I know of a female boxer.

366
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:04,547
What?

367
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:16,786
(Emperor Boxing)

368
00:24:38,347 --> 00:24:40,547
What? Why did you buy me clothes?

369
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:43,377
I bought them
so you could do laundry less often.

370
00:24:44,387 --> 00:24:45,387
You won't try them on?

371
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,817
Oh, you're wearing that.

372
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:49,417
Oh, my.

373
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:12,962
Ms. Lee, we'll get going.

374
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:14,561
Keep it up.

375
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:16,791
- I'll go bring the car around.
- Okay.

376
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:25,841
I'm sorry
for not visiting you often, Ms. Lee.

377
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:27,942
The training's intense, isn't it?

378
00:25:28,472 --> 00:25:29,942
No, it's fine.

379
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:34,081
Ms. Lee.

380
00:25:34,982 --> 00:25:37,311
I heard you mentioned
that you wanted to retire.

381
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:39,321
Oh, that.

382
00:25:40,782 --> 00:25:41,782
Yes.

383
00:25:41,782 --> 00:25:43,121
Mr. Kim told me.

384
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:45,121
While packing up earlier, he asked me...

385
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:47,922
- to take good care of you.
- "Packing up?"

386
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:52,262
Did he quit?

387
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:54,601
Yes.

388
00:25:55,331 --> 00:25:56,831
I guess the news hasn't reached you yet.

389
00:25:57,272 --> 00:25:59,041
No, I didn't know.

390
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,811
Coach, I heard Mr. Kim left the agency.
Did you know?

391
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:08,212
What?

392
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:10,752
Yes.

393
00:26:10,811 --> 00:26:11,912
Why did he quit?

394
00:26:13,422 --> 00:26:14,422
Well, he was just...

395
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:16,851
I think he needs a break.

396
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,091
A lot has happened, you know.
The thing with Kim Hee Won and all.

397
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,791
Suk, your sparring partner is here.

398
00:26:25,762 --> 00:26:27,532
Hey, but the thing is...

399
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:29,401
She's a kickboxer.

400
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,631
What?

401
00:26:30,901 --> 00:26:32,002
Not a boxer?

402
00:26:32,401 --> 00:26:34,601
She used to box
but has switched to kickboxing.

403
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,512
What?

404
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:51,222
Will you be all right?

405
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:52,962
They said she was a featherweight,

406
00:26:52,962 --> 00:26:54,091
but she looks like a super-featherweight.

407
00:26:54,891 --> 00:26:55,891
It's fine.

408
00:26:56,091 --> 00:26:57,492
I'll just think that I'm fighting a guy.

409
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:00,932
All right. Don't waste too much energy.

410
00:27:00,932 --> 00:27:02,002
Just check what you need to check.

411
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:03,732
This is just a sparring session,
after all.

412
00:27:04,131 --> 00:27:05,942
Okay. Don't worry.

413
00:27:07,672 --> 00:27:08,672
(Emperor Diet Boxing)

414
00:27:15,182 --> 00:27:16,182
Guard up.

415
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:18,512
Don't drop your guard.

416
00:27:26,192 --> 00:27:27,192
What?

417
00:27:29,091 --> 00:27:30,091
Hey, your arms. Let go.

418
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:31,532
Let go!

419
00:27:33,831 --> 00:27:35,131
- Oh, no!
- The arms.

420
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,131
- That's cheating.
- She just cheated, right?

421
00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:38,432
- What was that?
- That's considered cheating.

422
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:40,141
I can't believe she did that.

423
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:43,111
Hey, are you all right?

424
00:27:43,512 --> 00:27:45,041
She's no good. Let's just stop here.

425
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:47,081
I'm fine. I'll keep going.

426
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:48,742
If she cheats once more,
I'll call it quits.

427
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:54,621
Go.

428
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:10,831
- Nicely done!
- Way to go!

429
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:13,371
Nice.

430
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:28,922
- What?
- What?

431
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:30,321
- No!
- Stop!

432
00:28:30,321 --> 00:28:31,922
- Stop her!
- What's she doing?

433
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:36,932
Hey, Suk.

434
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:38,432
Are you okay?

435
00:28:39,462 --> 00:28:40,462
I'm fine.

436
00:28:41,662 --> 00:28:42,672
Hey, what was that?

437
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:45,672
Are you here to start a fight? Is that it?

438
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:50,341
Hey.

439
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:51,772
Are you all right?

440
00:28:52,641 --> 00:28:53,811
That girl's crazy.

441
00:28:55,782 --> 00:28:57,381
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

442
00:29:06,922 --> 00:29:08,621
Forget about Gweon Suk's match.

443
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:10,262
The deal is off.

444
00:29:10,631 --> 00:29:12,502
You can't decide that unilaterally.

445
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,401
If Gweon Suk wins this match,

446
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,301
I'll really end up dead.

447
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:46,732
You resigned...

448
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,831
- today?
- Yes.

449
00:29:50,101 --> 00:29:51,401
I'm not even surprised.

450
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:53,702
You said you wanted some time off.
But you resigned instead.

451
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:56,012
Are you switching to a new agency?

452
00:29:56,472 --> 00:29:57,942
No. I'm going to take a break.

453
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:03,051
Okay. You do need a break.

454
00:30:04,952 --> 00:30:06,551
I want to take a break too.

455
00:30:08,952 --> 00:30:10,151
What are you talking about?

456
00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:12,422
You should take Ms. Han to the US.

457
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:14,621
I'll introduce a good promoter to you.

458
00:30:14,762 --> 00:30:16,732
Work is all you want to talk about.

459
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:18,532
Seriously. You haven't changed.

460
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:30,512
Do you remember why...

461
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:34,881
we broke up?

462
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:41,381
Why are we suddenly
talking about our breakup?

463
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:43,522
Don't tell me you're already drunk.

464
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:47,222
I'm finally telling you the truth now.

465
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,762
I didn't want to be an athlete.

466
00:30:52,932 --> 00:30:56,202
I wanted to marry you
and have a child together.

467
00:30:58,401 --> 00:30:59,972
I just wanted a normal life.

468
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,841
But you told me that...

469
00:31:05,742 --> 00:31:07,282
I could keep going.

470
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:09,912
You wanted me to keep going.

471
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:11,881
You wanted me to compete
in the U.S. Open too.

472
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:14,222
I didn't want your talent to be wasted.

473
00:31:15,522 --> 00:31:16,891
You could do it,

474
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,462
but you kept trying to give up.

475
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:21,591
It was tough for me.

476
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:25,901
I thought you never loved me.

477
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:30,002
But looking back now,

478
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,401
that might have been
your way of loving me.

479
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:36,111
You know,

480
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:38,811
that crossed my mind.

481
00:31:46,381 --> 00:31:48,222
What? You're going to drink without me?

482
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:50,391
My glass had been empty for a while.

483
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:11,512
Get in.

484
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,341
Is that the only thing
you want to say to me?

485
00:32:14,742 --> 00:32:16,551
I told you everything that was on my mind.

486
00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:21,952
Ms. Jung.

487
00:32:24,452 --> 00:32:25,522
Yes.

488
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:29,091
Meet a nice guy.

489
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:33,401
Don't meet an awful guy like me.

490
00:32:34,962 --> 00:32:36,331
Meet someone nice and honest.

491
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:39,272
Is that what you want to say to me?

492
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:42,502
You're outright dumping me?

493
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:47,982
You'll regret losing me.

494
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:53,682
I already did for a very long time.

495
00:32:57,591 --> 00:32:58,722
Are you seeing someone?

496
00:33:05,032 --> 00:33:06,101
You are.

497
00:33:08,432 --> 00:33:09,432
Who is she?

498
00:33:11,232 --> 00:33:12,472
Do I know her too?

499
00:33:25,651 --> 00:33:26,982
Hey, what is it?

500
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,492
Gweon Suk is hurt.

501
00:33:29,922 --> 00:33:32,222
What? Where? How bad is it?

502
00:33:39,662 --> 00:33:40,702
How's Gweon Suk?

503
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:42,401
She's at the gym.

504
00:33:42,972 --> 00:33:44,772
Hey, do you call yourself her coach?

505
00:33:45,932 --> 00:33:47,942
Who is this athlete?
Where did you find her?

506
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:50,371
How can she cheat during a sparring match?

507
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:54,282
It's my mistake.
I had to find someone fast.

508
00:33:57,012 --> 00:33:59,252
He was a regular customer of Mr. Lee,
so I didn't suspect anything.

509
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:01,851
Gosh. Come on.

510
00:34:02,851 --> 00:34:05,522
What do you mean?
Gweon Suk's father has a regular customer?

511
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:07,662
Well,

512
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:11,831
I had a hard time finding
a sparring partner for Gweon Suk.

513
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:13,462
So I went to Mr. Lee to ask for help.

514
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:17,872
The customer at the restaurant said
he knew someone.

515
00:34:18,702 --> 00:34:19,872
So I said okay.

516
00:34:26,341 --> 00:34:28,782
Is this the regular customer
you're talking about?

517
00:34:29,082 --> 00:34:31,012
Yes. That's him. Do you know him?

518
00:34:45,131 --> 00:34:47,731
What? Mister.

519
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:56,271
How's your foot?

520
00:34:57,242 --> 00:34:58,611
Did the swelling go down?

521
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:00,941
I went to the hospital
and took an X-ray scan.

522
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:04,881
It's fine.

523
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:07,881
It will get better once I get some sleep.

524
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:11,551
That's good.

525
00:35:18,762 --> 00:35:19,861
Let me see.

526
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:34,282
Make sure to massage it with ice
every two hours.

527
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:37,012
Don't do roadwork until the match.

528
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:39,821
Okay.

529
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:45,292
What?

530
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:50,062
I heard you resigned.

531
00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:53,202
I did.

532
00:35:54,062 --> 00:35:55,202
Why did you quit?

533
00:35:56,231 --> 00:35:57,771
You like your job.

534
00:35:58,602 --> 00:36:02,042
I thought you said you were the best agent
in the industry. Are you not?

535
00:36:04,972 --> 00:36:08,111
I had always been at the top.
So it got tiring for me.

536
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,151
Are you really okay?

537
00:36:14,952 --> 00:36:16,622
Gosh. Of course, I'm okay.

538
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:21,091
You got hurt right before the match.
You shouldn't worry about me.

539
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:25,292
Besides, you should have gone home
right away after getting hurt.

540
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:26,401
Why did you come back here?

541
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:29,731
Well,

542
00:36:31,571 --> 00:36:32,771
I feel...

543
00:36:35,242 --> 00:36:36,872
most comfortable here.

544
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:42,341
I had always been here with you.

545
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:03,571
I'll stay with you
until your massage is over.

546
00:37:08,071 --> 00:37:09,071
Right.

547
00:37:11,742 --> 00:37:13,012
Start a 15-minute timer.

548
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:16,952
Start a 30-minute timer.

549
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:26,821
Were you hurt in any other places?

550
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:29,392
No. I'm good.

551
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:33,861
Gosh. I'm so relieved
that it's nothing serious.

552
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:42,171
Go inside.

553
00:37:43,312 --> 00:37:44,412
I'll see you at the match.

554
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:47,341
At the match?

555
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:49,711
I understand
if you can't make it to the weigh-in.

556
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:51,412
But you must be there
when I eat to regain my weight.

557
00:37:52,352 --> 00:37:53,452
I'll call you.

558
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,151
I'll see if I can make it.

559
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:56,792
Look at you playing hard-to-get.

560
00:37:57,722 --> 00:37:58,921
Just come.

561
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:01,921
Don't say stuff like
you're no longer involved in this.

562
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:05,691
I know you quit your job,

563
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:08,801
but this is the match you put together.

564
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:15,001
Okay, fine. Go inside now.

565
00:38:21,441 --> 00:38:22,441
Mister.

566
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:26,682
What?

567
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:29,082
Comfort me.

568
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:32,852
You have to comfort me this time too.

569
00:38:34,421 --> 00:38:36,361
Just like you did last time.

570
00:38:36,932 --> 00:38:37,961
Okay?

571
00:38:38,762 --> 00:38:39,901
What are you doing?

572
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:42,032
Comforting you.

573
00:38:42,562 --> 00:38:44,731
I think this is the only thing
I can do for you right now.

574
00:38:48,271 --> 00:38:50,111
You know that deep down,

575
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:52,111
I'm a coward.

576
00:38:53,742 --> 00:38:55,682
I'm doing this
even when I'm terrified to be in the ring.

577
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:06,251
Mister.

578
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:09,162
I'm sorry.

579
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:11,332
For what?

580
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:16,102
For coming to you that day.

581
00:39:22,702 --> 00:39:23,711
Whatever.

582
00:39:25,512 --> 00:39:26,941
I'm grateful that you did.

583
00:39:35,151 --> 00:39:36,222
I'm sorry.

584
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,691
Why are you acting like this?

585
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:43,162
I really am okay.

586
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:49,461
To be honest, I blamed you at first.

587
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:51,932
But not anymore.

588
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:54,472
I got to meet you.

589
00:39:59,512 --> 00:40:02,111
Your apology makes me feel worse.

590
00:40:05,812 --> 00:40:07,622
Come to the party after my weigh-in.

591
00:40:09,352 --> 00:40:10,452
Don't bail on me.

592
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:14,162
Okay.

593
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:15,861
Go on inside.

594
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:17,461
You go first.

595
00:40:49,262 --> 00:40:50,361
How does the injury look?

596
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:52,461
It's not serious,

597
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:54,631
but won't it affect her performance?

598
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:57,702
"Won't it affect her performance?"

599
00:40:59,131 --> 00:41:00,142
Oh, right.

600
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:02,771
I took a photo yesterday.

601
00:41:04,071 --> 00:41:05,142
Will you have a look?

602
00:41:14,751 --> 00:41:16,251
- Sang Cheol.
- Yes?

603
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:20,122
Do you think I'll sink this ball?

604
00:41:21,591 --> 00:41:22,691
It's so far off.

605
00:41:23,262 --> 00:41:24,731
Shouldn't you leave it to luck?

606
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:27,501
Didn't I tell you many times...

607
00:41:28,131 --> 00:41:29,532
that you make your luck,

608
00:41:30,102 --> 00:41:31,102
not leave it to chance?

609
00:41:32,832 --> 00:41:33,841
Yes, sir.

610
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:36,271
They look very close.

611
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:38,642
Don't they?

612
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:48,521
This is the Kim Oh Bok you know?

613
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:50,122
Yes.

614
00:41:50,992 --> 00:41:53,461
He did a great job
of masking his identity.

615
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:56,191
Then...

616
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:57,892
who is he really?

617
00:41:59,591 --> 00:42:00,602
Wouldn't he be Nam Hyun Ki?

618
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:04,432
That's quite likely.

619
00:42:07,202 --> 00:42:08,841
Find out more about Nam Hyun Ki for me.

620
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:10,941
What's this?

621
00:42:10,972 --> 00:42:12,642
Coach Yang's recording and evidence.

622
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:16,782
I'll look into it.

623
00:42:18,812 --> 00:42:20,051
To tell you what I know.

624
00:42:20,981 --> 00:42:22,321
I'll have to visit you in lockup.

625
00:42:27,961 --> 00:42:30,231
Lee Gweon Suk, step onto the scale.

626
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:31,392
(Women's Bantamweight
Title Match Weigh-in Event)

627
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:38,131
(WBC Women's Bantamweight
Title Match Weigh-in)

628
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:51,881
Weight, 53.5kg, 117.94lbs.

629
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:54,182
Lee Gweon Suk, Bantamweight. Passed.

630
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:03,262
Han Ah Reum, step onto the scale.

631
00:43:11,102 --> 00:43:14,341
Weight, 53.3kg, 117.5lbs.

632
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:16,711
Han Ah Reum, Bantamweight. Passed.

633
00:43:22,381 --> 00:43:25,852
Both athletes will pose for photos.

634
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:29,182
Please face the front and pose.

635
00:43:29,682 --> 00:43:32,122
Turn to your right and pose.

636
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:33,861
Boxing's still hot.

637
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,062
There are lots of journalists.

638
00:43:36,062 --> 00:43:37,832
Turn to your left and pose.

639
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:39,262
It's all down to Lee Gweon Suk.

640
00:43:41,102 --> 00:43:42,961
It's because she's up against Han Ah Reum.

641
00:43:45,602 --> 00:43:47,771
Everyone's talking about Gweon Suk.

642
00:43:47,771 --> 00:43:49,171
Don't you remember her return match?

643
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:50,972
It wasn't that heated then.

644
00:43:51,372 --> 00:43:52,912
Why are you fighting verbally?

645
00:43:52,912 --> 00:43:54,012
Get physical.

646
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:57,051
Sorry.

647
00:43:58,812 --> 00:43:59,812
You can do this.

648
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:06,151
The extensive interview must be draining.

649
00:44:06,151 --> 00:44:09,992
Finally, can I ask
how both athletes feel about this match?

650
00:44:09,992 --> 00:44:12,231
Let's start with Ms. Han,
the current champion.

651
00:44:18,571 --> 00:44:20,202
I'm not that special.

652
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,102
So I always...

653
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:25,372
trained that little bit more.

654
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:29,042
When I wanted to stop, a little bit more.

655
00:44:30,352 --> 00:44:32,782
When I thought I'd done enough,
a little bit more.

656
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:40,222
Tomorrow, I'll show you
how that time added up.

657
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,461
I promise to win.

658
00:44:48,832 --> 00:44:50,171
(Han Versus Lee)

659
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:53,401
Ms. Lee, what about you?

660
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,001
Please.

661
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,521
I got into boxing...

662
00:45:09,452 --> 00:45:10,751
when I was five years old.

663
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:15,521
Apart from the three years
I spent in hiding,

664
00:45:16,361 --> 00:45:18,162
I never took a single day off.

665
00:45:21,762 --> 00:45:24,332
I can proudly say
I put in more effort than anyone.

666
00:45:26,202 --> 00:45:27,301
And tomorrow,

667
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:30,472
I won't lose.

668
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:35,542
I want to compete
and not be ashamed of myself.

669
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:39,881
To win,

670
00:45:41,182 --> 00:45:42,981
I'll give my very best.

671

Please watch.

672
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:59,231
You're awesome, Ms. Lee!

673
00:46:10,012 --> 00:46:11,012
Shall we get some meat?

674
00:46:11,012 --> 00:46:12,151
Sounds good.

675
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:13,821
Ah Reum.

676
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:19,921
I'll wait in the car.

677
00:46:19,921 --> 00:46:20,921
Okay.

678
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:25,332
What is it now?

679
00:46:26,191 --> 00:46:27,562
Why do you follow me around?

680
00:46:28,102 --> 00:46:29,202
How's your shoulder?

681
00:46:29,702 --> 00:46:30,702
Why?

682
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:32,571
Are you afraid it's healed?

683
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:35,401
Well, no, I just...

684
00:46:36,401 --> 00:46:37,412
Are you a kid?

685
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:41,611
It's fine.

686
00:46:43,751 --> 00:46:44,852
Your ankle was taped up.

687
00:46:45,611 --> 00:46:46,682
Is it serious?

688
00:46:47,682 --> 00:46:50,151
I hurt a ligament while training.

689
00:46:52,251 --> 00:46:53,251
It's fine, though.

690
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:54,992
It won't affect the match.

691
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,992
Good. I was worried.

692
00:46:58,631 --> 00:46:59,731
I got afraid...

693
00:46:59,731 --> 00:47:01,562
I'd get criticized
for beating an injured girl.

694
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:03,401
It's fine.

695
00:47:04,832 --> 00:47:06,001
It's good to see you look okay.

696

Hey, where's Gweon Suk?

704
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,460
She's not eating?

705
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,730
She left with her phone.

706
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,500
She looked...

707
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:40,899
so forlorn...

708
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,170
and emotional.

709
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:44,299
What?

710

711

Get over here...

I won't feel let down if you don't,

718

One's for the partner of yours,
the one who won't let you eat.

Sorry?

786
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:46,080
Whenever I had a tournament,

787
00:51:46,609 --> 00:51:48,509
my mom tied my shoelaces for me.

788
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:53,020
So I'm thinking this was probably
how she felt in that moment.

789
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,520
Why? How does it feel?

790
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,529
You feel as if you're praying.

791
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,100
Please don't get hurt,
and make sure you win, Ms. Han.

792
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:14,569
It'll help me let go of my resentment.

00:56:56,489 --> 00:56:57,549
He's almost here.

838
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:01,420
Okay.

839
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,699
Hey, are you all right?

840
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,799
My gosh. You look really nervous again.

841
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,810
You know I always get like this
right before my matches.

842
00:57:20,009 --> 00:57:23,580
Hey, you always fight so well
once you're in the ring.

843
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,810
Why do you get so nervous?

844
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,250
I'll wait outside with everyone else.

845
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:32,089
Try to relax.

846
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,589
Thanks, Coach.

847
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,989
No problem.

848
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,489
Hey, guys. Let's wait outside.

850
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:52,879
Hey, are you here yet?

851
00:57:52,879 --> 00:57:54,179
Yes, I'm heading in now.

(Closed Today)

855
00:58:30,279 --> 00:58:33,049
Sorry, we're closed today.

856
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:07,679
Darn it.

857
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:11,549
Let's go!

858
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:14,060

Mister.

862
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,420
Are you...

863
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:17,290
comforting me right now?

864
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:24,589
Or I'll get the wrong idea.

865
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:27,730
Give me a moment...

866
01:00:29,969 --> 01:00:31,129
to breathe.

867
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,250
I'm so relieved.

868
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:50,049
What do you mean?

869
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:54,819
That I'm not late.

870
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,160
Seriously.
You should have gotten here earlier...

871
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,129
on a day like today.

872
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:15,310
You don't seem to be nervous at all today.

873
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,210
Aren't you scared?

874
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:18,920
What are you talking about?

875
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,120
I was shaking in fear up until
a moment ago because I was scared.

876
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:25,190
Look at this.

877
01:01:25,989 --> 01:01:26,989
I'm shaking.

878
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,410
What if I lose?

879
01:01:44,109 --> 01:01:45,109
Why would you lose?

880
01:01:46,279 --> 01:01:47,609
Ah Reum is strong.

881
01:01:47,609 --> 01:01:48,679
You're strong too.

882
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,310
Just give it your all.

883
01:01:52,149 --> 01:01:53,279
What if I still lose?

884
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:56,049
Then that's it.

885
01:01:57,649 --> 01:01:58,649
Then...

886
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,290
it won't look cool
when I tell people I'm retiring.

887
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,429
It will look like I'm running away.

888
01:02:13,899 --> 01:02:15,509
A loser who does her best
won't look like...

889
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,370
she's running away.

890
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:19,710
Don't worry about that.

891
01:02:22,609 --> 01:02:23,609
Okay.

892
01:02:31,089 --> 01:02:32,089
Mister.

893
01:02:34,089 --> 01:02:35,529
You have to watch me, okay?

894
01:02:36,429 --> 01:02:37,429
Okay.

895
01:02:37,989 --> 01:02:39,699
You have to watch me to the end...

896
01:02:39,699 --> 01:02:41,160
from where I can see you the best.

897
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:43,330
It's my last match.

898
01:02:46,739 --> 01:02:47,739
I'll watch it until the end...
