4
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,720
What are you doing over there?

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,269
Are you done with your practice?

6
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,730
No, not yet.

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,600
I stepped out for a moment
before my evening training...

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,570
because Assistant Director Han
stopped by to see me.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,109
It's been five minutes, right?

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,679
Yes, just five minutes.

11
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,280
You can't step out whenever you want,
even for just a minute.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,450
Don't you know that your breaks
are an extension of your training?

13
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,020
Why are you so angry?

14
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:50,420
I was about to head back in anyway.

15
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:51,689
Let's go inside.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,500
We've met before, haven't we?

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,010
Oh, yes. In front of the kindergarten.

18
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:13,010
Didn't you say you two met
on a blind date that day?

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,650
Please forget that.

20
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:22,120
You seem slow-witted,
so let me tell you this.

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,290
She's not an ordinary woman anymore.

22
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,260
She's a pro boxer who's getting ready
for her comeback match.

23
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,890
Do not contact her without my permission.

24
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,500
And do not visit her unless
you've made an arrangement in advance.

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,469
Mister.

26
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,500
What's the big deal
about him contacting me?

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,239
Why does he need your permission?

28
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,739
Who do you think you are?

29
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:39,739
You know who I am.

30
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,569
I'm your agent!

31
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,069
The person
who packs your lunch every day...

32
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,879
and makes sure you're healthy, feel well,

33
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,079
sleep well, and are getting
all the nutrients you need...

34
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,909
while taking care of you 24-7.

35
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,680
Oh, that's right.
I even do your laundry for you.

36
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:54,650
I washed your stinky sweatsuit.

37
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,420
Seriously, mister.

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,219
That's enough, okay?

39
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,030
See that?

40
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,560
That's the outcome
of your unannounced visit.

41
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,030
Let's go.

42
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,300
Don't touch me!

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,409
(Emperor Diet Boxing)

44
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:24,879
Seriously, what was that about?

45
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,960
If I never hear from him again after this,
it's all your fault.

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,990
Hey. If he really likes you,

47
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,189
he will contact you
even if I beg him not to.

48
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,259
Also, is it that important to you
at this critical time?

49
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,030
Whether he calls you again or not?

50
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,530
Yes, it is very important!

51
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,870
What I want to do isn't boxing.
I want to date!

52
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,039
What? You want to date?

53
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,069
That's what you want? Dating?

54
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,909
What's wrong with it?

55
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:55,009
You might think it's silly,

56
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,780
but romance is important to me.

57
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,849
This is my first time
experiencing these things.

58
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,219
Falling for someone...

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,419
and that person coming all the way here
to see me.

60
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:08,689
It really was such an important moment.

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,360
You ruined it all.

62
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,069
What happened?

63
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,110
What's up with her?

64
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,849
You ruffled her feathers again,
didn't you?

65
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,180
Hey, don't blame me!

66
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,120
Seriously. What's wrong with you?

67
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:37,289
She's already on edge
because she has to lose weight.

68
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:38,319
Even if you wanted to scold her,

69
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,360
you should've given her
some carrots first.

70
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,430
If you keep pushing her like that...

71
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,430
I wire you the money.

72
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,229
For coaching her and renting your gym.

73
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,930
Sook, let's start our evening training.

74
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,580
Stop.

75
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,789
Ho Joong, I need to talk to you.

76
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,329
You can't do this
in the middle of our training.

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,069
Gosh, he totally disrupted my flow.

78
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,870
You know what?

79
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,740
Don't worry about the first match.

80
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,939
Let's practice losing first.

81
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,449
Practice losing?

82
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,449
Tae Young.

83
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,620
What if she loses the first match?

84
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,589
Jo A Ra is a southpaw. She's left-handed.

85
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,060
She needs to work on her routine
from scratch. She has a lot to train for.

86
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,089
Then she can train to win and lose...

87
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,689
at the same time.

88
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,459
It only sounds easy.

89
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,129
Besides, it's weird that
she has to practice losing.

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,329
She still has to throw punches.

91
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:56,569
Her opponent can't find out.

92
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,000
And it's over if there's a dispute
over the result.

93
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Gosh.

94
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,410
Hey, why do you sound...

95
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,509
so negative without even giving it a try?

96
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:06,509
Tae Young.

97
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,750
I pivoted and opened up a boxing gym
to help people lose weight.

98
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,449
But back in the day,
I won the Top Instructor Award.

99
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,160
Can you respect an expert's opinion?

100
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,199
(Episode 4)

101
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,410
Why are you getting out of the car?

102
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,910
Are you going to come upstairs?

103
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,250
Don't do anything stupid.
Wash up and go to sleep right away.

104
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,449
Run the laundry right away.
And don't eat anything.

105
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,819
What a nagger. I can take care of myself.

106
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,089
And don't spend more than an hour
on your phone.

107
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:53,860
Go to sleep before midnight.
If you don't, it will show.

108
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:55,660
Gosh, he and his nagging.

109
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,569
Don't run. Hey, you might hurt yourself.

110
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,870
Gosh. That little...

111
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,639
Goodness.

112
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,470
(Battery)

113
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,920
Uncle Tae Young.

114
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,220
I begged my dad
to bring me here to see you.

115
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,790
My dad didn't want to come here, though.

116
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,089
- Gosh. Really?
- Yes.

117
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:29,490
- I have a question for you.
- Okay.

118
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,860
When will my dad be
a starting pitcher again?

119
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,370
- Why do you ask?
- Come on. You know why.

120
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,939
I already promised my friends
that I would take them to see his game.

121
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,439
But my dad won't give me an answer.

122
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,079
You must know.

123
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
Right?

124
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,209
Well...

125
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,519
Let's go back home, Ye Jun.

126
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,550
Your mom wants you to come back now.

127
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:55,120
Dad, can I...

128
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,389
ride that just once before I go?

129
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,430
Please? Just once.

130
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,399
Mom always tells me that it's dangerous.

131
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,560
She won't let me ride anything. Please?

132
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,029
Then it's just this one time. Okay?

133
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,800
Yes! Don't tell Mom, though.

134
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,339
Don't run. Be careful.

135
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,540
Okay.

136
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,310
I'm sorry. You must be busy.

137
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,050
But are you sure
you can let him ride that alone?

138
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,850
His eyes...

139
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:28,949
It's fine.

140
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,160
The field of his vision
has gotten narrower.

141
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:34,029
But he's managing.

142
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,329
How's your wife?

143
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,629
She's the same.

144
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,730
What about you?

145
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,209
Forget I asked.
You can't possibly be doing well.

146
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,350
I'm reaching out to a few teams.

147
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,649
If you don't want to retire yet,

148
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,649
I'll find you a new team.

149
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,319
Just rest up until I handle this.

150
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,959
It will get out of control
if you start getting involved too.

151
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,089
Okay.

152
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,430
Okay.

153
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,240
I'm sorry for making you come
all the way here.

154
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,250
Don't be sorry.

155
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,949
I get to see you again.

156
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
It's actually nice.

157
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:52,769
Do you remember these flowers?

158
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,639
The kids made this bouquet for you.

159
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,509
They asked me to give you
this bouquet of flowers.

160
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,850
I forgot to give it to you earlier.

161
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,490
It smelled just like that day.

162
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,690
The scent of my mother.

163
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,470
I just wanted to see your face.

164
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,009
And earlier, your agent showed up
out of nowhere,

165
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,950
so I couldn't tell you
everything I wanted.

166
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,710
It's about your match.

167
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,049
I was never interested in boxing.

168
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,120
It was my first time watching
boxing videos for that long.

169
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,590
To be honest, I was disappointed
that I could only see the videos.

170
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
I will watch your comeback match...

171
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:46,960
at the arena.

172
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:50,799
But still.

173
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,870
I don't want you
to watch me fight in the ring.

174
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,200
Why not? I thought you looked beautiful.

175
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,210
You're so cool.

176
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,850
One, two.

177
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,750
Hook.

178
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:11,950
- That's not right.
- What?

179
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,789
What's she doing?
I told her to go to sleep early.

180
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,759
She's got him to come over already?
Come on.

181
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,330
This is my first time
experiencing these things.

182
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,500
Falling for someone...

183
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,440
and that person coming all the way here
to see me.

184
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,639
That wasn't funny? Was it funny?

185
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,049
Look at her smile.

186
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,220
She should focus
on managing her condition.

187
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,850
What did he come by?

188
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,919
(If you don't eat it because
it's not tasty, you'll get constipated.)

189
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,889
You didn't run the washing machine,
so I did it.

190
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,860
Are you even trying
to manage your condition?

191
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,960
If you don't go to sleep before midnight
starting today, I'll take your phone away.

192
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,860
You're spending too much time
in the bathroom. Are you constipated?

193
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,399
Make sure to eat the boxed meal.

194
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,700
If you don't eat it because
it's not tasty, you'll get constipated.

195
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,700
If you get chronic constipation,
there's no remedy for it.

196
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,269
He's unbelievable.

197
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,509
What's the look on your face?

198
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,379
Were you touched?

199
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:53,549
I have severe constipation.

200
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,490
I guess it's because
I couldn't go number two.

201
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,190
No, it's probably because
you were distracted by other things.

202
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,659
What are you talking about?
Did you see what I did last night?

203
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,429
Did you sleep before midnight or not?

204
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:07,029
Were you on your phone the whole night?
I'll check your phone.

205
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,799
I went to sleep before midnight.

206
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,470
You'd better not touch my phone.

207
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,139
I'll report you. I won't hesitate.

208
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,809
Like this.

209
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:22,879
Hey!

210
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,620
What's the look on your face?

211
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:26,419
You must be touched by what I did.

212
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,320
Hey, I'm much older than you.

213
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,659
Hey!

214
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Yes. That's it.

215
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,559
Let's go.

216
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,330
- Faster.
- Come on.

217
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,029
That's it. Faster.

218
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,730
- Gosh, are you tired already?
- Hey!

219
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,870
Hey, you'll never be ready
for a match at this rate. Faster.

220
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,240
That's it. Let's go.

221
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,110
Faster. Yes. Nice.

222
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,710
That's it. Let's go.

223
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,919
There were so many articles
about Lee Kwon Sook.

224
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,350
So I was expecting you.

225
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,360
Don't even think about using Ah Reum
for her comeback match.

226
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,659
Use her?

227
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,389
After she wins her comeback match,
she'll challenge Ms. Han the right way.

228
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,460
For the champion title.

229
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,000
You've got to be kidding me.

230
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:15,600
Can't you see that?

231
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,230
(Remaining 52 days
until the 4th title defense for WBC)

232
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,639
Ah Reum's title defense
is less than two months away.

233
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,070
If she wants to win the champion title,

234
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,139
she will have to wait six months
until Ah Reum's next title defense.

235
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:25,080
She can't wait for six months. Come on.

236
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,080
What can you do
about a match that's already scheduled?

237
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,809
I won't consider anyone but Han Ah Reum.

238
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,490
Lee Kwon Sook has no WBC ranking.

239
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,889
Would they even let her compete?

240
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:36,990
They said yes.

241
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,159
We can do what we want.

242
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,190
What?

243
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,029
It's Lee Kwon Sook.

244
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,769
The girl skipping out there
is Park Hye Jin, right?

245
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,470
Ex-champion.

246
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,139
Why mention her?

247
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,039
She returned her title because...

248
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,940
she couldn't find an opponent
for two years.

249
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,909
I'll set up a match.

250
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,409
You punk.

251
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:03,110
Are you using Hye Jin
as a bargaining chip?

252
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,919
Do you think I don't know how you think?

253
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,389
What was that?

254
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:15,259
The card of someone
who came by before you to bait me.

255
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:16,759
If you want to work with my athletes,

256
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,230
talk to that person instead.

257
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,159
It's my agent.

258
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,500
(Jung Soo Yeon, About Sports)

259
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,009
Back out.

260
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,610
Don't get involved.

261
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,610
I don't want to back out.

262
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,480
I decide whether I get involved or not.

263
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,809
There's no profit in boxing.

264
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:36,210
I'm not in it for the money.

265
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,220
What's your purpose?

266
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,379
Why do you want in?

267
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,990
You first.

268
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:46,460
Why do something that makes no money?

269
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,159
That's not what you do.

270
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:51,830
Do you...

271
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,700
have a crush on her?

272
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,299
- What?
- Did you fall for Lee Kwon Sook?

273
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,639
She's a boxing genius.

274
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,210
And you have a thing
for sporting geniuses.

275
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:07,340
That's why you fell for me. Am I wrong?

276
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:09,149
Yes.

277
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,149
Then what is it?

278
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,320
It makes no sense.

279
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,019
It's not profitable,

280
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:19,259
and you didn't fall for her talent.

281
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,990
It's not love either.

282
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,299
Why did you bring her back?

283
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:28,600
You dragged her back
when she hated boxing.

284
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,399
You don't need to know. Just back off.

285
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,509
I won't.

286
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:38,379
I'm fired up because of you.

287
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,909
Endorphins are flowing through me.

288
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,779
You've got Lee Kwon Sook,
but wait and see.

289
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,820
I'll make sure Han Ah Reum
climbs higher than Lee ever did.

290
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,950
I'll beat you this time.

291
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,320
Who's the return match against?

292
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:55,889
Jo A Ra.

293
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,759
It's not final yet.

294
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:01,899
You'll use Jo A Ra
to get the media interested,

295
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,669
then snatch the title from Han Ah Reum?

296
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,570
Everyone has a decent plan.

297
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,240
Since we're against each other,
let's make this big.

298
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,809
Follow me.

299
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,889
Hey.

300
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,700
Here are your beers.

301
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Ms. Han.

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,100
Ah Reum.

303
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,379
My coach called.

304
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:51,480
Are you here about Lee Kwon Sook?

305
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,419
To get me to fight her?

306
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:54,450
Yes.

307
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,350
What do you say? Are you interested?

308
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,519
It'll be a legendary match.

309
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,490
I won't fight Lee Kwon Sook.

310
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,000
Don't waste your time.

311
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:12,670
Why not? Is it because you might lose?

312
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:14,769
Or lose the championship belt?

313
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,440
I can fight Kwon Sook a hundred times
and win a hundred times.

314
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,380
Then why won't you?

315
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,710
Oh, because of the incident
three years ago?

316
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,480
Because Lee disappeared before the match?

317
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,849
She's a traitor.

318
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,789
Do you know...

319
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,859
how we fought to survive
in the mess she created?

320
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:41,529
All female Korean boxers
can be as rude to her as they want.

321
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:51,940
Ms. Han.

322
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,710
How much do you make boxing?

323
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,220
- What?
- It's rude...

324
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,289
to ask that.

325
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,460
This is business.

326
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,190
Do you make enough to live on
serving beer part-time?

327
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,529
Your coach is in debt because he had to...

328
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,259
pay for you to defend your title.

329
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,529
Will you pay him back?

330
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,130
What is it you want to say?

331
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,640
Fight Lee Kwon Sook.

332
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,640
Instead of regretting it later.

333
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,369
Forget training in a ring
where no one sees you.

334
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,509
Enter the ring with the world watching...

335
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,740
and fight Lee Kwon Sook.

336
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:30,650
That's the way...

337
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,420
to keep your beloved boxing alive.

338
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:39,259
Say yes and I'll repay you...

339
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,230
with a payment that goes down
in Korean boxing history.

340
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,900
Why do you keep talking about money?

341
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,400
Who wants to fight
the likes of her to make money?

342
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:51,000
You have everything but money.

343
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:54,609
It's time you made some money too.

344
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,809
Even if Kwon Sook
were to come to me and beg,

345
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:00,809
I wouldn't fight her.

346
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:03,009
Don't come here again.

347
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,119
Seeing you makes me want to puke.

348
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,190
Mom.

349
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,259
I sent this month's expenses.
Did you get it?

350
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,259
Okay, good.

351
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,369
I also sent a winter jacket.

352
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,769
It's cheaper if you buy it
before it gets cold.

353
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,200
Send me a picture when you get it.

354
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,769
Okay. Send me a nice one.

355
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Hey.

356
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,250
Ms. Jo. Hi.

357
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,750
I thought you weren't in
and were just about to leave.

358
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,890
It's you, isn't it?
I almost didn't recognize you.

359
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:00,599
Where did you get my address?

360
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,940
Coach Lee begged me to make sure...

361
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,039
this match happened.

362
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:08,180
Darn him.

363
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,980
Also, these people
pleaded with me to meet with you.

364
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,720
What's that?

365
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,690
(Love Ara Member Petition)

366
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,359
- "Love Ara?"
- "Love Ara."

367
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,859
Your fan club president
is really enthusiastic.

368
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:28,430
I'm so envious.

369
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,470
You have had a strong fan base
that has sent you...

370
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,539
as much as 50 to 100 dollars
every month for years.

371
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:35,869
So what?

372
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,680
Are you getting sentimental with me?

373
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,079
Even if I were to get
sentimental with you,

374
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:44,720
would it work?

375
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,049
It's just that these people...

376
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:50,390
want the match more than anything.

377
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,859
Think about it...

378
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:57,289
and call me within 48 hours.

379
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,660
I can't wait for you forever.

380
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,400
Oh, right.

381
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,769
About the fight money.

382
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,069
It won't be six-four this time.
For you, especially...

383
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,250
It'll be eight-two.

384
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:18,779
Says Coach Lee.

385
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,849
Gosh. You're here early.

386
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,390
Darn it.

387
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,660
Did you have to see me like this?

388
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,059
I can't wash these anywhere else.

389
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,589
Follow me.

390
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,369
(Management Office)

391
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:16,539
Come in.

392
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,720
Gosh. Most of my employees
rarely come into the office.

393
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,359
Take a seat.

394
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:46,569
Would you like a cup of tea?

395
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,609
I have some hojicha leaves.

396
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:49,839
Shall I brew some for you?

397
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:52,509
No, thank you. I'm good.

398
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,910
Then how about some hot water?

399
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,680
Drinking hot water
does wonders for your body.

400
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:06,319
My father drank this every morning.

401
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,529
But the thing is,
he passed away before the age of 60.

402
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
My goodness.

403
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,069
Anyway, why did you want
to see me out of the blue?

404
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,940
I'm so scatterbrained.

405
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,609
I wanted to ask you
who would fight her in her comeback match.

406
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:26,809
You could've just asked me over the phone.

407
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,980
I figured I should do this to see you.

408
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,349
We need to see each other often
to be on friendly terms.

409
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:36,849
Why must I be on friendly terms with you?

410
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,849
What do you mean, why?

411
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,289
We should become friends
so that we can keep working together.

412
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,160
That way,
I can save face with the chairman too.

413
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
What?

414
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,000
Will you really do it once
and call it quits?

415
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:53,400
I get that Lee Kwon Sook is a one-off,

416
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:56,740
but I'm more intrigued
by your other athletes.

417
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:02,549
What do you say?

418
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,049
Don't you think
we can become good friends?

419
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,250
The thing is,

420
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,759
I'm very selective when it comes
to who I become friends with.

421
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:20,500
Look, Mr. Kim.

422
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:22,369
I'm a busy man,

423
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,799
so stop wasting my time
with all this nonsense, okay?

424
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:26,769
I have...

425
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:29,809
no intention
of being part of the rigged game...

426
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:31,609
in any way.

427
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,019
Mr. Kim.

428
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,089
You're a funny guy.

429
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,720
Do you know what "paradox" means?

430
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:49,059
At the moment,

431
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,490
you're trying to put
the nationally beloved genius boxer...

432
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,859
in a rigged game and make her retire.

433
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,269
Right?

434
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,430
And you said you'd take care
of Kim Hee Won too.

435
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,640
But what?

436
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,400
You have no intention
of being part of the rigged game?

437
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,180
That's paradoxical. Am I wrong?

438
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,710
As for Hee Won, it can't be undone.

439
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:12,450
However,
I won't make the same mistake twice.

440
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,420
I didn't force Lee Kwon Sook
to do anything.

441
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,690
I'm simply following her wishes,

442
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:22,089
which is why
I'm facilitating her plan to retire.

443
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,490
I see.

444
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:27,599
Is that so?

445
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,970
If it makes you feel better
to see it that way...

446
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,970
Go ahead and keep thinking that.

447
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,049
(Paran Tour)

448
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,710
- What has gotten into him?
- What is going on?

449
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
- He's giving me the creeps.
- He's giving me the creeps.

450
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,460
(A hook at your heart!)

451
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Hey.

452
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,200
Stop staring at Kwon Sook's face.

453
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,369
You'll pierce a hole through her face.

454
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,880
The kids asked me to show you these.

455
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,710
They drew you in their art class today.

456
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,609
(Assistant Director)

457
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,990
Look at that. She's smiling again.

458
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,230
I smile too,
when I'm looking at my phone sometimes.

459
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,259
She won't put her phone down.

460
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:38,960
Doesn't everyone have that problem
these days?

461
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,230
Smartphone addiction.

462
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,170
Even so, it's odd
that she just can't stop smiling.

463
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,700
Maybe she just has a smiley face.

464
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,369
She's been following all my instructions
and has been training well.

465
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,380
What's your problem?

466
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:54,109
Kwon Sook!

467
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
Practice.

468
00:27:56,849 --> 00:28:00,380
Mister, can I please take
a five-minute break?

469
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,990
Just five minutes. Please?

470
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
She must be losing her mind.

471
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,990
Did you see that?

472
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,359
- See what?
- She usually gets annoyed...

473
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,900
when I tell her to practice,
but she smiled.

474
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,069
My goodness.

475
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,470
It's nice that she's in a good mood.
Must you be so twisted?

476
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,380
I'm worried because that's a sign
that she doesn't want to box.

477
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,279
Becoming obedient all of a sudden...

478
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,779
or becoming all quiet instead of whining.

479
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,950
Who said that?

480
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,049
It's the exact same situation.

481
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,089
Kwon Sook is doing
the exact same things...

482
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,529
she did right before she ran away.

483
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:43,529
Right?

484
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,660
Try it.

485
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:49,569
Our ox bone soup is famous.

486
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
So is my restaurant.

487
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,650
By the way,

488
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,750
I don't see any pictures of Kwon Sook
in the restaurant.

489
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,359
I don't want people to say
I'm using my daughter...

490
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,019
even at the restaurant to earn money.

491
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,630
This place is like my shrine.

492
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:18,599
It has nothing to do with Kwon Sook.

493
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,700
Kwon Sook's penalty.

494
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:24,569
How much is it?

495
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:25,569
The penalty?

496
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,869
- Why do you ask?
- What do you think?

497
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:31,140
She doesn't want to box.

498
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,079
Come on! You can't do that now.

499
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,079
Why not?

500
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,609
If Kwon Sook really doesn't want to do it,

501
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,609
just let her go.

502
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,250
As for the penalty...

503
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,220
Whether I have to sell the restaurant
or my body,

504
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,490
I'll pay it.

505
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,630
Take this.

506
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,799
Give some to Kwon Sook too.

507
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,529
(Champion Ox Bone Soup)

508
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:56,529
Mr. Lee.

509
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,369
What's your daughter's weakness?

510
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:03,339
I'm asking, so I can help her get ready.

511
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,279
I've already made up my mind...

512
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:09,009
not to get involved in anything she does
if it's connected to boxing.

513
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,009
Do you understand?

514
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,920
She's made the difficult decision
to return to the ring,

515
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,150
so she shouldn't lose.

516
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,390
Lose? Who, Kwon Sook? To whom?

517
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:19,420
Kwon Sook has no weaknesses.
My daughter is...

518
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,190
a monster that I raised.

519
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,359
Well, who knows?

520
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,059
If she lets her guard down...

521
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:31,099
Well, Kwon Sook...

522
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,599
Maybe without her counterpunches,
she could still lose.

523
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:37,039
"Counterpunches?"

524
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,339
That's right. Counterpunches.

525
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:43,579
Make sure she focuses on
practicing her counterpunches.

526
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,279
If her counterpunches have become rusty,

527
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
she could lose.

528
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
What is this?

529
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,529
What are we doing with this?

530
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,930
Making sure you will lose.

531
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,069
We'll use this,
so you can't throw any counterpunches.

532
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,700
My punches?

533
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Yes, your punches.

534
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:13,579
All right. The rules are simple.

535
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,809
You can dodge your opponent's punches...

536
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,549
or defend yourself,

537
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,250
but you cannot counterpunch.

538
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,420
The moment you try to extend your arm,

539
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,490
this band will stop you.

540
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,230
Try it once,
and you'll get the hang of it.

541
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,589
Try it with Ho Joong.

542
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,569
Let's do this.

543
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:37,970
Ready, go!

544
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,839
Are you all right?

545
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,039
Here we go.

546
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:47,339
Come on!

547
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,380
One more time.

548
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:52,849
Come on.

549
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,289
One more time.

550
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:00,359
Don't be too conscious of the band.

551
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,289
It'll automatically stop you
when you try to throw a punch,

552
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,500
so punch all you want.

553
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,630
Will you please stop
going on about punches?

554
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,069
It's easier said than done.

555
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:14,799
You can do it.

556
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,470
Try it once more.

557
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:24,180
What are you waiting for? Just do it.

558
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420
I won't do it.

559
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,289
What's the point?

560
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:32,490
I'll lose anyway.

561
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,259
I can just let her punch me.

562
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:43,130
Let her punch you?

563
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,900
So you're going to lose the match
like some pathetic boxer?

564
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,170
You must still do your best in the ring
even if our end goal is to lose the match.

565
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,410
That's the least you can do
to show respect for the ring.

566
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,509
Respect?

567
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,049
You're the last person
to talk about respect.

568
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,690
You're helping me lose the game.

569
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,690
Yes. I'm the son of a witch.

570
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:08,930
But you're a boxer.

571
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,759
You should at least have respect
for other boxers.

572
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:14,460
Have you ever thought about
how it has been...

573
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,670
for your opponents,
Jo A Ra and Han Ah Reum, all these years?

574
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:20,269
They have been protecting the ring
you ran away from.

575
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,869
So what?

576
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,339
Stop lecturing me.

577
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,140
It's not like I want to be here.

578
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:32,220
Who said you could leave?

579
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,720
Your training isn't over yet.

580
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,250
Put down your phone!

581
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,119
You can't bring in your cell phone
during your training starting today.

582
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:40,490
Says who?

583
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,529
Who do you think you are?

584
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,059
You little...

585
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,269
- Have you gone mad? What are you doing?
- I...

586
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,970
put my life on the line for this game.

587
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,069
I can't ruin my life
because of your love life.

588
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:03,579
What's gotten into you?

589
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:05,309
Who said you could take my phone?

590
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,519
I'm not your slave.

591
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,150
Do you think I'm joking right now?

592
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,750
If you're not going to do what I say,

593
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,190
pay me the penalty of 2.5 million dollars
and leave.

594
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,519
It was you who signed the contract.

595
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,860
Take responsibility for your actions
or leave.

596
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,690
Make a decision.

597
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,630
Did you say 2.5 million dollars?

598
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,699
You've crossed the line.

599
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,070
You're acting just like my dad.
Do you know that?

600
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,070
Do you think I'm some boxing machine
that makes money?

601
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:32,909
I hate you.

602
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,710
Darn it.

603
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,880
Hey, Sook!

604
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,320
Gosh.

605
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,030
Yu Ri.

606
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,469
One of the parents told me
that you were here.

607
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,239
You surprised me.

608
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,670
How did you get here?

609
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:03,309
You're not training today?

610
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,639
I should be training,
but I don't want to do it.

611
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,349
I'm sorry to distract you from work.

612
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,489
I wanted to go somewhere,
but I had no place to go.

613
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,789
And I didn't know where to go either.

614
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,070
I'm glad you're here.

615
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,369
But did something happen?

616
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,139
Something must have upset you.

617
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,119
This isn't good.

618
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,389
I don't have any tissue.

619
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,530
Yu Ri.

620
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,800
You can lean on me and cry.

621
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:05,699
What?

622
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:12,780
Can I?

623
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:16,010
Of course. Lean on me.

624
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,849
I won't watch you cry.

625
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,820
You can blow your nose on my jacket too.

626
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,329
I won't do that.

627
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:09,500
Gosh. Come on.

628
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:10,869
Hey, Tae Young.

629
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:13,300
She didn't come back to the gym, right?

630
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,110
No, she didn't. She's not home either?

631
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,039
No.

632
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,909
She might go to the gym late at night,
so keep checking.

633
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,849
By the way,

634
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,719
Kwon Sook will show up, right?

635
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,989
Shouldn't we call the police?

636
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:31,150
Don't be ridiculous.

637
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,389
Do you want to read
about her disappearance in the newspapers?

638
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:35,389
I'm just worried about her.

639
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:38,030
Gosh, I hope she's not crying right now.

640
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:05,090
- This is funnier.
- What's this?

641
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,219
- That's funnier.
- Gosh.

642
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,460
You!

643
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,619
Where have you been all day?

644
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:42,960
Don't you know what time it is?

645
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,760
How could I possibly know that?

646
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,030
I don't have my cell phone.

647
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:55,909
Gosh. Why did you fold my laundry
without asking me first?

648
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,469
This isn't the first time.

649
00:38:58,309 --> 00:38:59,539
I always folded your laundry.

650
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:01,239
I folded them yesterday too.

651
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,050
From now on, don't touch my laundry.

652
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,849
It's annoying.

653
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:27,440
So you were out
taking stupid pictures with Mr. Han?

654
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,909
Yes. I was. So what?

655
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,940
Do you know how worried
Ho Joong and I were?

656
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,239
Why did you worry about me?

657
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,480
In case
your money-making machine broke down?

658
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,119
- You...
- Enough. Leave now.

659
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,550
You didn't finish folding the laundry.
Where are you going?

660
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,760
Don't spend too much time on your phone!

661
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,559
Or I'll take it from you!

662
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:52,829
Gosh. Seriously.

663
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,329
Stupid laundry.

664
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,199
(Name: Han Jae Min)

665
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,730
Name, Han Jae Min.

666
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,869
He graduated from Sungsil University
as a business major.

667
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:03,510
He failed to find any jobs
one after another.

668
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:07,280
He got a job through nepotism
at his mother's kindergarten.

669
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,679
As the assistant director,
apparently, he's not doing...

670
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,309
much.

671
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:15,119
He usually films
external promotional videos.

672
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,650
Hold on. Could it be possible that...

673
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:22,119
he approached Ms. Lee to use her
to promote the kindergarten?

674
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:25,630
No. I doubt that's the case.

675
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,230
Based on my analysis of him
through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,

676
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:31,369
Han Jae Min...

677
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:33,340
(The cheerful campaigner)

678
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,769
is not the type
to take advantage of people...

679
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:38,670
or use sly tricks.

680
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,440
He applied for a job at our agency.

681
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:44,550
Yes. I checked with HR.

682
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,179
He didn't pass the resume phase
three years ago.

683
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:47,820
That's suspicious.

684
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,559
Is it possible that
our competing agency hired him as a spy?

685
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:54,820
Like Jung Soo Yeon.

686
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,530
She's been coming to our agency
way too often.

687
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,690
Ms. Jung won't do something like that.

688
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:01,800
Then what's going on?
Are they simply dating?

689
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,469
Then we can just manage the risks.

690
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:10,070
On that note,
can I hire a private investigator?

691
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,510
Hey, I haven't heard from you.

692
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,639
You ought to give me a follow-up report.
You punk!

693
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,679
What is it? Should I prepare
some money for the penalty?

694
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:21,980
No. Nothing special happened.

695
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,050
It's about her personal life.

696
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,389
Her personal life? What do you mean?

697
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:29,760
I think she has a crush on a guy.

698
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:32,460
What? A guy?

699
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,230
(Champion Ox Bone Soup)

700
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:37,170
This is the place, right?
That little punk...

701
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,599
Sir!

702
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,369
You can't just show up out of the blue.

703
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:42,670
You can't make a scene here.
This is a kindergarten.

704
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,070
Let go of me before I lose my patience.

705
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,840
- Gosh.
- Hey. Do you have a death wish?

706
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,610
How do you expect me
not to do anything after hearing that?

707
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,010
What?
Who said I was going to make a scene?

708
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,949
I'll take a look at the guy...

709
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:54,650
and talk to him quietly.
That's all I'm going to do.

710
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,920
Your existence is already so loud.

711
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,619
Stay here. Calm down.

712
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,159
Hey.

713
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,260
- Who is that?
- Where is he going?

714
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,969
- We should follow him.
- Follow him?

715
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,510
(Emperor Diet Boxing)

716
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,690
Did I make you wait?

717
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,559
A bit.

718
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,329
That dirtbag.

719
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,530
Hey. I can't see properly.

720
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,429
Do you have binoculars?

721
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:44,869
Who has that in their car?

722
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:46,039
You're a sports agent.

723
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,239
Do you watch baseball games without them?

724
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,510
I watch from the VIP stand.

725
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,840
Darn you.

726
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:55,539
Hey.

727
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,579
They're dating.

728
00:42:58,449 --> 00:42:59,449
Look at him.

729
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:02,480
He's just the type Kwon Sook likes.

730
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,690
He looks like me in my heyday.

731
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:06,389
What?

732
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,130
Ta-da.

733
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,400
Hey.

734
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:18,630
- We saved the same one.
- Yes.

735
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:23,409
Oh, but...

736
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,639
the other teachers will notice
if that's your screensaver.

737
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,909
I want them to notice.

738
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,690
Do you water the flowers?

739
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:41,059
Yes. Why?

740
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,159
The teachers talk about
how they don't like it.

741
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,170
Gosh. They're all so mean.

742
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:56,539
I should be nicer to them.

743
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:02,909
The five minutes are up.

744
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:04,610
It goes by too fast.

745
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,519
I get a day off after my return match.

746
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:09,389
Let's hang out then.

747
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:10,389
Okay.

748
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,159
Who are you up against first?

749
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,030
What are they saying?

750
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:18,630
We're too far off.

751
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,630
Your hearing's failing already.

752
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:24,199
I'm not a cyborg.

753
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:26,469
Good luck.

754
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:27,739
Thanks.

755
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
Anyway,

756
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:31,269
after the return match,

757
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,139
will you stay with your current agent?

758
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,139
Why?

759
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,179
He bothers me a bit.

760
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,489
He signed me for just two matches.

761
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,059
Just two.

762
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,960
Working with him...

763
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,860
I won't work with him after that.

764
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,500
That's the condition of my return.

765
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:59,400
Then after that,

766
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:02,000
you can be with me.

767
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:05,940
All the time.

768
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,079
Yes.

769
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:16,719
Just for five seconds.

770
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:36,769
One,

771
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:38,969
two,

772
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,840
three,

773
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:44,750
three-and-a-half,

774
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,119
three-and-three-quarters.

775
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,949
That darn scum.

776
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:55,019
No, please. Please, stay still.

777
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,789
You said you wouldn't
meddle in her life anymore.

778
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:00,059
Let go, fool. That was about boxing.

779
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,130
What girl's dad would keep still...

780
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,929
after witnessing that?

781
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,530
- Calm down.
- It's over.

782
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:08,840
It's over. It's okay now.

783
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:10,809
It's okay.

784
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,039
- Why? What? No, sir!
- Let go of me.

785
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:16,679
You, punk!

786
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,210
Darn it!

787
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,090
Yes, you. You, punk.

788
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:37,829
You dare hug whom?

789
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,639
Who did you dare touch?

790
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:41,070
Who are you, mister?

791
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:42,539
You punched me.

792
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:44,610
Me? I'm Kwon Sook's dad.

793
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,980
How dare you give me that look?

794
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,210
Sir, seriously...

795
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,650
Darn it.

796
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,750
In the middle of the night
on a brightly lit street.

797
00:46:55,949 --> 00:46:58,949
I didn't raise my precious girl
so the likes of you could hug her.

798
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,300
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

799
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,530
I'm fine. It's bearable.

800
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,900
If you do see a doctor, call me.

801
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,369
My company will pay for your treatment.

802
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:20,309
And...

803
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,750
If Kwon Sook were to hear of this,

804
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,980
the rift with her father
would only deepen.

805
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,250
It could affect her match too.

806
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,889
I won't tell.

807
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:33,619
Don't worry.

808
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,690
I'll compensate you separately.

809
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:37,989
For what?

810
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,659
He's Kwon Sook's father.

811
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:41,300
I don't need compensation.

812
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:43,670
Okay, then.

813
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,099
Can I ask you something?

814
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:51,269
Go ahead.

815
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:54,139
Kwon Sook's next match.

816
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,039
Who's her opponent?

817
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:02,179
Why do you ask?

818
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:10,159
How about Ms. Han Ah Reum?

819
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:12,860
Three years ago,

820
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,960
she lost her title because of Kwon Sook.

821
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:18,769
A revenge match between them...

822
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:21,739
would fire things up.

823
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,969
You must like sports a lot.

824
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:28,039
After her contract with you ends,

825
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,179
I might represent her myself.

826
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,880
She'll feel more comfortable
around me too.

827

(Emperor Diet Boxing)

828
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,130
Ta-da. Here I am.

829
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,829
(Emperor Diet Boxing)

830
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:52,099
Gosh. This place is amazing.

831
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:54,199
What's the theme of the interior?

832
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:55,969
Is it a cafe look?

833
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:57,070
(Where is she?)

834
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,309
(I love you, A Ra.)

835
00:48:58,309 --> 00:49:00,280
The lighting's fantastic.

836
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,380
(The lighting's great.
You look 100 times prettier.)

837
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,809
(Hello)

838
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:04,849
People.

839
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:08,119
This hungry boxer can only cry.

840
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:09,920
(Pay A Ra more.)

841
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,050
Ms. Jo.

842
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,519
(Don't cry.)

843
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:14,760
You can't break into
someone else's studio.

844
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:15,889
People.

845
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:17,889
Do you see her?

846
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:19,059
It's Lee Kwon Sook.

847
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,760
Do you see her over there?

848
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,500
Where are your manners?

849
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,530
(Hello)

850
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,730
(Get out.)

851
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,469
Turn that off.

852
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:27,599
(Kwon Sook's fans aren't welcome here.)

853
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,639
(That coach and Kwon Sook's fans
are all helpless.)

854
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:31,170
A scary man appeared.

855
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:33,340
How the meeting with Kwon Sook went down?

856
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:35,739
I'll tell you later.

857
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:37,579
Bye.

858
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,579
Goodbye.

859
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,489
I'm here to talk.

860
00:49:44,019 --> 00:49:45,250
With Kwon Sook in person.

861
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,090
How much are you getting paid?

862
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:52,559
Why do you ask?

863
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,199
So I can ask for more than you.

864
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,829
Based on experience and results,

865
00:49:57,269 --> 00:49:58,329
I'm better than you.

866
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,400
Ms. Jo.

867
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:03,940
Don't you have a coach?

868
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,710
What are you doing here,
trying to bargain?

869
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:10,010
This is me.

870
00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:12,150
I decide my pay.

871
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:17,050
I want 10,000 dollars more than you.

872
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,719
Or there's no fight.

873
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,960
Let's talk another time,
with her agent present.

874
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,329
You're the boxer.

875
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,260
Where are your guts?

876
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,030
Deal?

877
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:34,969
Deal.

878
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,250
Perfect.

879

(Jo A Ra, Lee Kwon Sook)

880
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,570
Darn it.

881
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,170
You're two kilograms overweight.

882
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:10,440
From now on,
lunch and dinner are dietary fiber only.

883
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:27,719
Hey, Kwon Sook!

884
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,789
My goodness.

885
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,239
- There you are.
- Did I keep you waiting too long?

886
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,440
- About an hour.
- What?

887
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,150
Just kidding.

888
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:51,449

Hey, that guy is ridiculously handsome.

891
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,900
Kwon Sook has high standards after all.

892
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,500
Hey, why did you let her go out,
knowing she's trying to lose weight?

893
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:12,400
They'll go and eat something together.

894
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,469
Well, it's only for two hours.

895
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:16,099
She needs to let loose here and there.

896
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:18,710
If you keep pulling the rein, it'll break.

when you throw punches.)

(Live, Teaching Lee Kwon Sook a lesson)

899

That lunatic.

900
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,300
Darn it!

00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:52,469
Gosh.

902

Hey, what is the reason...

903
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,449
you have to come all the way here
for a run?

904
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:03,619
Do you have OCD?

905
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:08,420
On this important day,
you showed up reeking of alcohol.

906
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:11,829
I went out with some people
who would help us and bought them drinks.

907
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:13,130
Drinking is part of the working culture.

908
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:20,769
I need hangover soup. My stomach is upset.

909

Hey.

910
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,480
That little...

911
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,139
Wait up!

912
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:31,179
Wait up!

913
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:40,260
Why didn't you come last week?

914
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:41,519
We waited for you.

915
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:43,090
From now on, I'll come every day.

916
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:44,389

No.

won't even let me drink water.

What? That little...

920

Goodness.

921
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,869
If he keeps food from you, just steal it.

922
00:53:57,409 --> 00:53:59,139
- Okay?
- Yes.

923
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,480

That punk. My goodness.

00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,630
Don't tell me you came all the way here
for a lollipop.

927

Stop talking to me.

929
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,400
Do you think I can't run
because I'm hungover now?

930
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,110
I used to be... Wait! Stop.

931
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:34,179
I was a catcher.

932
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:36,480
Catcher? As if.

933
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,809
Are you sure you were a baseball player?

934
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:40,980
Why would I lie about that?

935
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:45,650
Number 22. Team Yujin High's catcher.

Oh, the Monster Pitcher?

938
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,599
I thought you were just his agent.

939
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,900
Now, you think differently of me?

940
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:00,670
You won't believe me, but I was
quite famous in high school baseball.

941
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,840
Then why did you quit baseball?

942
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:07,139
Well...

943
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,610
Because of an injury. What else?

944
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,079
Why did you quit?

945
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:16,719
You clearly weren't injured.

946
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,849
I already told you. I hate boxing.

947
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:23,090
Right. Why do you hate it so much?

948
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,329
Mister.

949
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,159
Do you know what
the most important thing is in boxing?

950
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,929
Well...

951
00:55:30,969 --> 00:55:31,969
Your fists?

952
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,050
Standing.

953
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:48,349
In boxing,

954
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:51,250
the one who remains standing
at the end is the winner.

955
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:54,920
My dad said
boxing was like life in many ways.

956
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,059
That's why I hate boxing.

957
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:00,500
I mean, what kind of life is that?

958
00:56:00,699 --> 00:56:02,400
Even if you're exhausted,

959
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,699
you can't even sit or lie down to rest?

960
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,039
It's miserable.

961
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:08,639
But you fight a match to win.

962
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:10,340
Life isn't about winning.

963
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,809
I can't get cold, so I'll keep going.

964
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:16,239
Take a break if you're tired.

- She's unstoppable.

00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,929
and the rest all sold out too.

987
00:58:13,929 --> 00:58:16,559
However, the TV networks
won't buy the right to broadcast it.

988
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,829
It'd be great if they did.

989
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:19,500
(I Love Sports)

990
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,369
Then between Lee Kwon Sook and Jo A Ra,

991
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:24,239
who do you think is more likely to win?

992
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:25,639
It'd say it's Lee Kwon Sook.

993
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:29,480
One heavy punch from her
can knock out anyone.

994
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,179
I think Jo A Ra will win.

995
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:34,380
A three-year hiatus is
too big a handicap for an athlete.

996
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,420
It'll be hard for her
to beat an active boxer.

997
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,789
Besides, Jo A Ra is at her peak now.

998

(K-boxing Hipster Jo A Ra
versus Genius Boxer Lee Kwon Sook)

999
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:52,329
Let's do this!

(K-boxing Hipster Jo A Ra
versus Genius Boxer Lee Kwon Sook)

1001
00:58:58,469 --> 00:59:01,780
- Jo A Ra!
- Why are Jo A Ra's fans there?

1002
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,849
- We adore you, Jo A Ra!
- We adore you, Jo A Ra!

1003

- We adore you!

- We love you, Jo A Ra!

1008
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:21,929
Oh, Mr. Kim.

1009
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,030
Did you have a good dream?

1010
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,500
I hope you had a lucky dream.

1011
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:28,170
Good luck!

1012
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:32,670
Who is he?

1013
00:59:33,909 --> 00:59:35,010
Do you know him?

1014
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:36,840
He is Kwon Sook's fan.

1015
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,909
Jo A Ra is so pretty!

1016
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,250
I'll go check in on Kwon Sook.

1017
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,920
Okay.

1018
00:59:58,429 --> 00:59:59,630
Ms. Jo.

1019
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,969
My, you must be feeling great today.

1020
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:03,099
You seem very relaxed.

1021
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:05,170
Why should I be nervous?

1022
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,039
Well...

1023
01:00:08,139 --> 01:00:11,349
You're about to go up against
the genius boxer, Lee Kwon Sook.

1024
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,210
How do you feel?

1025
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,019
(K-boxing Hipster Jo A Ra
versus Genius Boxer Lee Kwon Sook)

1026
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:16,079
How do I feel?

1027
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:19,550
I'm psyched.

1028
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:21,889
Of course.
You're brimming with confidence.

1029
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,989
Do you have a special strategy for today?

1030
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,059
Hey, honey.

1031
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:32,869
You can use your hands and feet
in kickboxing,

1032
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,739
whereas you can only use your hands
in boxing.

1033
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:37,469
Do you know why more people have died
in boxing matches?

1034
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:41,280
Well, I'm not sure.

1035
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:50,019
It's because we only attack one spot.

1036
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:53,090
I see.

1037
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:56,559
Your hands.

1038
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,500
It's done. Good luck.

1039
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,030
Thank you.

1040
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:06,900
Oh, hello.

1041
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,469
Did he say anything else?

1042
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:15,679
- No.
- You checked everything, right?

1043
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,110
Yes, all good.

1044
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:27,889
What is it?

1045
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,090
Are you all right?

1046
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:33,289
I want to be alone.

1047
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:36,000
Can everyone leave?

1048
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,130
Ho Joong.

1049
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:40,599
Okay.

1050
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,769
Let's leave.
We should use the restroom too.

1051
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:45,010
- Okay.
- Okay.

1052
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:01,590
What's wrong with you?

1053
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:03,159
Are you not well?

1054
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,429
Don't look at me.

1055
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,360
You should leave too.

1056

Hey, how could I leave
when you're like this?

1057
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,000
Please just leave.

1058
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,099
You're sick.

1059
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:17,239
That punk, Ho Joong.
How did he manage your condition?

1060
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:19,869
What kind of coach
manages his athletes like this?

1061
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,309
Don't badmouth him.

1062
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:23,780
He didn't do anything wrong.

1063
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,679
Stay here.
I'll get the ringside physician.

1064
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,250
Stop it.

1065
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,219
You don't have to do anything.

1066
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:37,889
I'm always like this before my games.

1067
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,400
I'll feel fine once I get up in the ring.
So just let me be.

1068
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:02,750
What are you doing?

1069
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,250
Comforting you.

1070
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:10,159
I think this is the only thing
I can do for you right now.

1071
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:25,570
When I was young,

1072
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:29,639
every time I sparred with my dad,

1073
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:35,320
I thought he might punch me to death.

1074
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,250
I had to swing my fists to survive.

1075
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:43,320
I was scared of dying.

1076
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:46,389
I didn't want him to beat me to death.

1077
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,500
I must be losing it.

1078
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,269
Why am I telling you this?

1079

You can tell me more.

Tell me whatever you want to say.

1081

I'll listen to everything.

Yes.

against us and took our sponsors.
