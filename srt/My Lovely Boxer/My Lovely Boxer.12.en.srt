1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,950
Give it to me.

("Life knocks us down,
and we get up again.")

00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,170
(The Final Episode)

5
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,289
Sorry for being rough with you.

6
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,689
We prepared this special room
for Lee Gweon Suk.

7
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,259
Do you like it?

8
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,670
Is this what you do when you hang out?

9
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,239
You must be bored out of your mind.

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,939
That's right.
I'm bored out of my mind these days.

11
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,069
And nothing's going my way.

12
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,939
Meanwhile, things seem to be going well
between you and Lee Gweon Suk.

13
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,409
Shut your mouth.

14
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,549
Hurry up and kill me.

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,590
Go ahead and kill me.
Then we can put an end to this.

16
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,219
Why would I kill someone for no reason?

17
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:24,290
That's no fun.

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,290
You will die...

19
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,159
only if Lee Gweon Suk wins.

20
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,299
Just kill me,
so we can put an end to this all...

21
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,500
because I know Gweon Suk will win.

22
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:38,840
Is that so?

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,870
No one can mess with that match now.

24
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,140
- It's out of my hands now.
- You little...

25
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,540
You think you can run away from this?

26
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,450
Mr. Kim. No matter what you do,
you can't run away from this.

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,879
The scale is on another level
compared to Kim Hee Won's game.

28
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,920
The sum of bets exceeds
that of all the previous matches.

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,019
Even if you die,
it certainly won't be enough.

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,539
You scumbag!

31
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,680
(Lee Gweon Suk's dressing room)

32
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,919
Suk.

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
You're ready, right?

34
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:33,830
Yes.

35
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,099
Han Ah Reum? She's nothing.

36
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:42,669
You can finish her in one blow.

37
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:43,900
Knock her out as soon as it begins.

38
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:45,740
You can do it, right?

39
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:48,439
You're the best.

40
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:49,969
You have everyone at your feet.

41
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,139
You are the Queen.

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Don't forget that.

43
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,680
Coach, I can see
that you've watched a lot of movies.

44
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:00,250
You memorized that line, didn't you?

45
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,389
- Was it that obvious?
- Yes.

46
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,659
It was cool though.

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,259
All right. Put on your gown.

48
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,400
(Emperor Diet Boxing)

49
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,870
What's that?

50
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,879
Sorry. I want to wear this instead.

51
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,180
This dragon is nice though.

52
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,550
You see,
I was going for the royal robe look.

53
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,620
If you win the champion title
wearing this...

54
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,300
All right.

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,189
(Han Ah Reum versus Lee Gweon Suk)

56
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,789
All right, guys. Today, you'll shout "Suk"
instead of my name. Okay?

57
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:14,629
"Gweon Suk." Ready, go!

58
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,459
- A Ra!
- No!

59
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,600
- Suk.
- Gweon Suk.

60
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,699
We're here to root for Lee Gweon Suk. Who?

61
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:21,829
- Lee Gweon Suk!
- Lee Gweon Suk!

62
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,269
Okay, let's go!

63
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:26,269
- Suk!
- Suk! You're doing great.

64
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:29,310
- Louder!
- Suk! Suk is the winner!

65
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,279
- Go, Gweon Suk!
- Go, Gweon Suk!

66
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:36,509
- Let's go!
- You got this!

67
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,649
All right. The fight is about to begin.

68
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:41,290
Oh, my. Look at my palms.
They're all sweaty.

69
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,620
I mean,
it's just a boxing match after all.

70
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,290
Why am I so nervous?

71
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,860
This isn't "just a boxing match."

72
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,089
Lee Gweon Suk versus Han Ah Reum.
Have you seen this before?

73
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,629
Korean female boxers
fighting over the WBC title?

74
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,470
No, this has never happened before.
Not even once.

75
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,970
Gosh, my heart is pounding!

76
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,480
Hurry up, will you?

77
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,839
Okay.

78
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,980
Whose fault was it
that we were late the last time?

79
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,180
- Right?
- My point, exactly.

80
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,379
I can hear you.
I'll go without you ladies, then.

81
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,920
- No, stop!
- Wait up!

82
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,420
- Gosh.
- Come on.

83
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,019
(Women's bantamweight title match)

84
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,670
Sorry we had to bring you
all the way here.

85
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,639
You were so kind to me.

86
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,870
It's shameless of me to do this.

87
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,610
Shame?

88
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,180
What are you up to?

89
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,310
You people.

90
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,019
Are you engaged
in stuff like match fixing?

91
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,930
Hey, you scumbag.

92
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,300
Did you sell my daughter off...

93
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,300
to these sly snakes?

94
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
And what?

95
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,399
"There's nothing to worry about?"

96
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,410
Listen carefully, Kim Tae Young.

97
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,540
If Gweon Suk's match ends like this,

98
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,310
I will kill you first.

99
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,279
I will destroy your life, you jerk!

100
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,360
Let go. Let go of me, you jerk!

101
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,600
Please let him go.

102
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,180
He has nothing to do with this.

103
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,550
He has a lot to do with this.

104
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,779
He is Gweon Suk's father.

105
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:52,850
Please!

106
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,160
Let him go.

107
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,029
Just kill me, and let's call it quits.

108
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,329
You're a very interesting man.

109
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,170
You voluntarily took on
Kim Hee Won's debt.

110
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:13,269
Now, you're going to die
because of a boxing match?

111
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,870
Because you're Gweon Suk's agent?

112
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,310
I can't do that?

113
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,680
Don't be ridiculous.

114
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:23,509
Please let it go
and don't meddle with the match!

115
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,290
Scumbags like us should not step in.

116
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:32,860
No one has the right...

117
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,160
to ruin this match.

118
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,959
You know all the right things to say,
don't you?

119
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,100
But you were going
to toss Lee Gweon Suk after using her.

120
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,769
Stop playing the hero.

121
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,569
I told you the stakes were
much higher than I expected.

122
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:51,980
If this match goes well,

123
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,680
not only will I clear all the debt
you owe me,

124
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,709
but I will also give you some extra cash.
Got it?

125
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,319
From this moment on, let's only focus
on the profit we can make. Okay?

126
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,550
Let's keep it simple.

127
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,589
Sir, I need you to go to the arena now.

128
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,230
Go and tell your daughter...

129
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,560
if she wins this match,
I'm going to Kim Tae Young for real.

130
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,629
Don't tell her anything.

131
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:14,129
Never!

132
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,730
She should get knocked down
a few times during the game. Right?

133
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,170
It will be risky if she wins by decision.

134
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,100
She should get knocked down
around Round 8 or Round 9.

135
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,709
Understood? Hey, escort him.

136
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,839
Mr. Lee.

137
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,050
Gweon Suk said she would win.

138
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,810
She said she wanted to win!

139
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,120
This is going to be her last fight!

140
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,149
It will be her last match!

141
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,950
Please help her!

142
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,620
You got my daughter involved in this?

143
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,590
You shady merchant!

144
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,159
(Han Ah Reum versus Lee Gweon Suk)

145
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,000
Everyone, thank you for your patience.

146
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:54,210
The biggest boxing game in Korea
will begin now.

147
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,570
It's the world champion title match...

148
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,110
for the female bantamweight class of WBC.

149
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,309
The two fighters will enter now.

150
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:02,850
The first fighter from the blue corner.

151
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:04,980
The boxing genius.

152
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,120
The championship gold medalist.

153
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,649
Here comes Ms. Lee Gweon Suk.

154
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,259
(Lee Gweon Suk)

155
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,759
(Bantamweight gold medalist,
world champion gold medalist)

156
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:21,570
Ms. Lee Gweon Suk is entering.

157
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,230
The championship gold medalist.

158
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,700
She also won gold medals
at the World Tournament...

159
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,169
and the Asian Games.

160
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:30,909
She's indeed the strongest amateur fighter
in the bantamweight class.

161
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,039
She has only knockout wins so far.
She's versatile,

162
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,480
but her lethal punch is
her signature move to watch out for.

163
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,080
- Suk!
- Suk!

164
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,620
- She's reacting...
- You're killing it.

165
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,149
- to the cheer from her fans.
- Suk!

166
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,350
- You can dodge like a pro.
- You can dodge like a pro.

167
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,120
- Let's go, Gweon Suk!
- Let's go, Gweon Suk!

168
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,570
- Lee Gweon Suk!
- Lee Gweon Suk!

169
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,139
- Lee Gweon Suk!
- Lee Gweon Suk!

170
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,039
- Lee Gweon Suk!
- Lee Gweon Suk!

171
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,169
She's meeting
the eyes of her cheering fans...

172
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,409
and giving them fist bumps as she enters.

173
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:08,080
- Lee Gweon Suk!
- Lee Gweon Suk!

174
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,419
- Lee Gweon Suk!
- Lee Gweon Suk!

175
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:26,429
This way.

176
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,669
Huddle up.

177
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:33,539
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- Let's go!

178
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,409
Ms. Lee has come into the ring.

179
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:41,509
(Han Ah Reum versus Lee Gweon Suk)

180
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:44,179
She's bowing to the audience.

181
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,889
Mister. You have to watch me, okay?

182
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,190
It's my last match.

183
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:53,590
She's holding up her hand high...

184
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,629
to respond to the audience's cheer.

185
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,000
A lot of people are looking forward
to her match. You know?

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,029
- Right.
- After a long career break,

187
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,970
she's challenging
the world champion again.

188
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,200
I hope she gives her all to this fight
to show us all of her skills.

189
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,019
The fighter from the red corner
to oppose Lee Gweon Suk,

190
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,879
the pride of Korean boxers.

191
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,389
The WBC world champion...

192
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:23,919
of the bantamweight class.

193
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,990
Han Ah Reum is entering now.

194
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,129
(Han Ah Reum)

195
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,029
Ms. Han Ah Reum is introduced.

196
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,559
(The current WBC bantamweight champion)

197
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,970
She's the bantamweight world champion
of WBC.

198
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,730
This is her fourth defense match.

199
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,669
She's nationally recognized
as an incredible boxer.

200
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:42,139
Look at her eyes. She's got fierce eyes.

201
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,009
Her pose is confident too.

202
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:47,879
(Giant Boxing, looking for members)

203
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,080
Wait. That just now...

204
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,519
- Gosh.
- I see a phone number.

205
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,779
I see.

206
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,419
She's gesturing for them to call the gym.

207
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:56,850
Right. How witty.

208
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,919
The world champion
doesn't seem nervous at all.

209
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:04,460
Everyone is calling out
Ms. Han Ah Reum's name.

210
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:09,129
Once Ms. Han gets into the ring,

211
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,539
the match will begin soon.

212
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:14,309
- Han Ah Reum!
- You got this!

213
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,139
- Han Ah Reum!
- Han Ah Reum!

214
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,389
These guys. They watched too many movies.

215
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,789
Wash the mask at least, you jerks.

216
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:35,830
The stink was killing me. Come on.

217
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,330
Get out.

218
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:46,370
All right. Come.

219
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,809
(Han Ah Reum versus Lee Gweon Suk)

220
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,409
The chief referee is calling
both of the fighters.

221
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,110
- Box!
- The game has begun.

222
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,279
It's the WBC women's
bantamweight title fight.

223
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,019
It's Han Ah Reum versus Lee Gweon Suk.

224
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,850
- To the right.
- Han starts jabbing first.

225
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,720
Lee hasn't made any moves yet.

226
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,389
She's jabbing right now.

227
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,360
Han is warming up for now.

228
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,399
It seems Lee isn't focused.

229
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,929
Suk, what are you looking at? Focus!

230
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,799
Suk. Look at her gloves!

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,870
Han takes a swing at her.

232
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,070
But Lee dodges it.

233
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,840
Suk, don't circle around.
Close in the distance.

234
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,610
The two fighters
are sizing each other up for now.

235
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:29,909
Lee should focus.

236
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,019
- Suk. Get your gloves up!
- Gloves up, Suk!

237
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,080
Ah Reum, go for it now! That's it!

238
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,090
Han throws a right-hook punch.

239
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,250
And a left hook!

240
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:43,889
Oh, no. Lee Gweon Suk.

241
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,299
- She's down.
- She's down.

242
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:46,730
- She's down.
- Well done!

243
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,000
- Lee Gweon Suk is down.
- Great!

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,070
I knew it. She's the world champion.

245
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,100
- Han's punch landed right on her face.
- Yes!

246
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
To your corner.

247
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,710
I can't believe that just happened.

248
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,340
No one has knocked her down so far.

249
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:00,409
Three.

250
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:03,379
Four.

251
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:07,019
Five.

252
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,019
(Han Ah Reum versus Lee Gweon Suk)

253
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,159
- Hey, get up. Suk!
- Get a grip, Suk.

254
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,360
Get up, Gweon Suk!

255
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,629
Oh, no! You have to get up!

256
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:18,429
- Oh, no.
- Ms. Lee, please get up!

257
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,799
Gweon Suk, you can do this!

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,269
Don't forget to breathe. Breathe!

259
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,639
Lee Gweon Suk. Get up.

260
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
Seven.

261
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,110
He promised to watch me.

262
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,350
Lee Gweon Suk, get up!

263
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,759
Don't run away.

264
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:49,889
This is your last match.

265
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,370
You can do this.

266
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,639
This ring is for fighters, not quitters.

267
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,500
Get up now!

268
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:03,009
Dad.

269
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,350
- She's up! Lee Gweon Suk!
- Lee Gweon Suk!

270
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,649
- She's getting up.
- Lee Gweon Suk.

271
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:14,889
She's up!

272
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
What a relief.

273
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,059
Gosh. I thought the game was over.

274
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,120
Are you okay?

275
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,889
- Can you still fight?
- Goodness.

276
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,529
Don't you know who she is?
There's no way the game is over.

277
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:25,500
- Box!
- The game resumes.

278
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,629
- Okay. Let's go.
- I wonder if Lee recovered from it.

279
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:30,769
Let's go.

280
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,340
Han throws a right jab and a left hook.

281
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,440
A right jab and a left hook.

282
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,870
Han continues to attack her.
Her movements seem light.

283
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,009
- Put your gloves up. Hang in there.
- A left jab from Lee.

284
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,509
Lee is coming back to life now.

285
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,879
Stop.

286
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,379
Back to your corners.

287
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,019
The trip gong rings. Round One is over.

288
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Water.

289
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,169
Coach. I can't find Mr. Kim. Where is he?

290
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,440
He's probably watching from somewhere.

291
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,000
Focus on your match.

292
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,470
You promised him to win.

293
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,279
Dad, what are you doing here?
I told you not to come.

294
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,340
What happened to your face?

295
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Don't worry about that.

296
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:16,610
You focus on your game.

297
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,889
Suk, forget about all the training
you've had so far.

298
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,659
Extend your arms all the way. Okay?

299
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,519
I know, but I can't get through her guard.

300
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,490
Her feet are quick too.
I can't find a way in.

301
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:31,899
Suk.

302
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,830
Think about why you could've won so far.

303
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,299
Han's stamina will be stronger than yours
in the second half.

304
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,940
Her feet are quick, and she's patient too.

305
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,370
What do you need to do then?

306
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,210
I'll end this before Round Three is up.

307
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,909
That's it. You must be aggressive
with your offense. Okay?

308
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:54,149
- Box!
- There she goes.

309
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,620
Stop.

310
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,059
Give me some water.

311
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,099
All right. Keep your gloves up this round.

312
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,930
Suk, focus.

313
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,400
That's it. Go for it now! Go!

314
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,910
It's the midpoint of the game already.

315
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,140
Round Five begins.

316
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,250
(Han Ah Reum versus Lee Gweon Suk)

317
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,680
As soon as the round begins,

318
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,950
Lee bombards Han
with a barrage of punches.

319
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,220
She got Han at a corner.

320
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,750
She's unleashing
a series of strong punches at her.

321
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,289
A right hook. Han is staggering.

322
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,660
Despite that, but she still stands firm.

323
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,559
Han clings to Lee.

324
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,930
- Stop!
- They both seem exhausted.

325
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,069
- Pause.
- This is so frustrating.

326
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,599
Why is this so frustrating?

327
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,069
It's already round five.

328
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:51,740
- Right. Han isn't attacking at all.
- Box!

329
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:53,640
I get it. It's a strategy.

330
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,250
Lee already went down once.

331
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:57,509
Han's aim is to drain Lee's energy. Right?

332
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:00,180
Lee has been away for a while.

333
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,119
This is no fun at all.

334
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,750
Lee must be furious.

335
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:07,220
Lee's left punch misses by a mile.

336
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,829
Han serves up a right hook.

337
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:13,000
It got her right in the face!

338
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,630
Han really has a powerful punch.

339
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,200
Stop! Round over.

340
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,099
- She did it.
- Oh, no.

341
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,740
What did I tell you?

342
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,140
I said it was a strategy.

343
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,710
Are you okay?

344
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,920
No.

345
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:34,380
I'm scared.

346
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,720
She's the strongest I've ever faced.

347
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,960
Gweon Suk.

348
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:44,529
If it's too much,

349
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:46,900
you can stop fighting.

350
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,430
You can stop.

351
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,869
Losing a match like this...

352
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,569
is nothing in life.

353
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,470
What are you saying?

354
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,970
I want to win, Dad.

355
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,779
Tell me how to break her defense.

356
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
How do I get in?

357
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,849
I said I'd stay out of your matches.

358
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,349
Why say that
when you came all the way here?

359
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,319
It's my last match, so tell me.

360
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,619
You're retiring anyway.

361
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,259
Not winning a belt won't be
the end of the world.

362
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,960
It's not about winning or losing.

363
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:18,630
I want to do my best.

364
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,500
I need to give it all I've got,

365
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,599
so I never have to come back.

366
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,670
Tell me how to beat her.

367
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,569
You know how.

368
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,180
Gweon Suk said she would win.

369
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,509
She said she wanted to win!

370
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,720
Please help her!

371
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,750
Listen carefully.

372
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:48,059
Instead of avoiding it,
attack when she's covering up.

373
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:49,759
Then she'll open up suddenly.

374
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:52,759
When she opens up,
leave it to your instinct.

375
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,299
Put all you have...

376
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:56,529
into one punch.

377
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,789
Box!

378
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,089
It's round six.

379
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,900
Listen carefully.

380
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:35,869
Instead of avoiding it,
attack when she's covering up.

381
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,509
Then she'll open up suddenly.

382
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,849
Lee goes for the torso, and again!

383
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,720
She's going for the arms
Han put up to defend herself.

384
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,519
She has a new target.

385
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,150
She let her guard down!

386
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,559
- Now!
- Go for it!

387
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:55,630
Lee's right-hand punch got in!

388
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,359
Han loses her balance and falls.

389
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,299
The rope saved her.

390
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,440
Han refuses to give up. She's up again.

391
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,009
My gosh. Han Ah Reum's still standing.

392
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,509
I can't believe she survived that.

393
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,839
Lee Gweon Suk, one more punch!

394
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,480
- Suk, don't let off.
- Go!

395
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,680
Keep going!

396
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,279
Keep pushing! Right, left!

397
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,650
Cover up!

398
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,819
Get out of the way!

399
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:23,690
Lee's using the momentum
to keep up the attack.

400
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,319
This is what to do!

401
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,490
Lee's right-hand punch!

402
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,799
The bell rang out.

403
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,099
She was saved by the bell.

404
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:37,930
It's over. No, the bell...

405
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,869
You said you didn't take sides.

406
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,039
How do you think the sixth round went?

407
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:48,480
I wondered how Lee
would take on Han in round one...

408
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,680
She hasn't yet been told to lose.

409
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,880
You could lose your life.

410
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,420
What's a championship belt
compared to that?

411
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,750
As for Han Ah Reum...

412
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,529
She's to go down twice
and get knocked out in round eight.

413
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,099
- What?
- Tell your daughter right now.

414
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,039
Or a man dies.

415
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:16,910
Are you okay with that?

416
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,309
You don't care
as long as your daughter wins?

417
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:20,440
Did I tell you to kill him?

418
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,049
If you want her to do that,
tell her yourselves.

419
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,390
You wouldn't dare
for fear of ruining the match.

420
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,450
Watch what you say.

421
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,690
Do you think your daughter
gets to live if she wins?

422
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,059
The championship belt?

423
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:38,329
Do you think it's about that?

424
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,170
What is it about, then?

425
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,869
You don't have to know.

426
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,339
Punks like you won't get it
until the day you die.

427
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:52,339
Why we won't listen to you.

428
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,589
A loser of a criminal
who can't even give his real name.

429
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,500
I really don't get
why everyone's like this.

430
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,670
What's the big deal
about refusing to throw one match?

431
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,509
If she were to just lose today,

432
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:23,339
everyone could get what they wanted.

433
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:25,279
Give it some thought.

434
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,539
I can make a fortune,

435
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,450
Han can win, Lee can retire,

436
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,779
and you can live. Am I wrong?

437
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,490
Move. I'll talk to her.

438
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,390
I said I'd talk to her. Get out of my way.

439
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,869
By the way.

440
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,740
Goodness.

441
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:02,309
Darn you.

442
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,279
Stay away from my girl.

443
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,519
Or I'll kill you.

444
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:14,960
Hello? Is this the police?

445
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,859
It's round nine.

446
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,960
Lee's laying on the punches.

447
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,700
She should be exhausted,

448
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,200
but she trained hard for this.

449
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,869
A left punch from Lee.

450
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,039
Left jab and right.

451
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,740
Another right punch!

452
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:33,440
Lee Gweon Suk! And Han's down!

453
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,910
That's it!

454
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,279
- Han Ah Reum.
- Nice!

455
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,349
- Ah Reum.
- She's down on her knees.

456
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,519
Han Ah Reum's down!

457
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,950
A great punch from Gweon Suk!

458
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,519
They're even now.

459
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,660
Han Ah Reum! Get back up!

460
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,829
You don't get it at all.

461
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,869
It has nothing to do with that.

462
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:01,069
Look at them.

463
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,309
They're giving it their all.

464
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,779
Three.

465
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,579
- Han's trying to get up.
- Four.

466
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:12,150
Ah Reum.

467
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,450
- Five.
- Keep going.

468
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:15,390
Yes, that's it.

469
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,720
- What determination.
- Six.

470
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,619
Han's showing her fighting spirit.

471
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:19,690
Seven.

472
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,230
To no run away.

473
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,130
To keep moving on somehow.

474
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,630
Are you okay? Can you keep going?

475
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,400
They don't want to tarnish that.

476
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,940
That's all.

477
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,069
Vermin like you will never get it,

478
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,940
even in your next life.

479
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,279
How romantic.

480
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,819
I thought you'd come to your senses
after getting Hee Won killed.

481
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,859
You're still just as clueless and rash.

482
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,789
You killed Hee Won.

483
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,490
You murderer.

484
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,430
We killed him together,

485
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,170
you murderer.

486
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,369
You son of a witch!

487
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,579
The match resumes.

488
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,210
Son of a witch!

489
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,190
Lee's raining punches on her opponent.

490
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,190
Han looks drained.

491
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,759
Right into her stomach!

492
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,630
Han staggers,

493
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,259
and Lee punches relentlessly.

494
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:36,500
Han is holding Lee.

495
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,470
- Will she hold out until the tenth round?
- Stop!

496
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:41,710
Well... Now, it all depends
on their mental strength.

497
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,640
The referee broke them up.

498
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,150
Ms. Han.

499
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,059
Box!

500
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,730
The fight has resumed.

501
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,799
They both look quite tired.

502
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,599
At the end of the day, it's about
who can hold their ground for longer.

503
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:11,970
Lee Gweon Suk versus Han Ah Reum.
Han Ah Reum versus Lee Gweon Suk.

504
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:17,140
They're throwing a punch at the same time!

505
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,539
They both took a big hit.

506
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,009
A beautiful cross-counter!

507
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,150
Lee Gweon Suk, Han Ah Reum!

508
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,450
Lee is knocked down!

509
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,450
- Down!
- Down!

510
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,450
- Lee is down!
- Lee is down!

511
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,990
(We love Lee Gweon Suk.)

512
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,160
No!

513
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,690
This is the third time
Lee has been knocked down today.

514
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,700
Han is standing firm.

515
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,799
- Three!
- Han has such strong willpower.

516
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,400
- Four!
- Gweon Suk, are you all right?

517
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,529
Hey, get up.

518
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:45,740
- Can you keep going?
- Lee Gweon Suk!

519
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,099
- Five!
- Keep breathing.

520
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:48,910
Get up, Gweon Suk.

521
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:50,509
Six.

522
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:53,109
Seven.

523
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,690
Lee is getting up.

524
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,319
Lee Gweon Suk! She really is impressive.

525
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,859
A cross-counter comes at you
when you have your guard down...

526
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:11,529
while throwing a punch,

527
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:13,099
so it can do a lot of damage.

528
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:16,730
That's right. They both look exhausted,

529
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,240
but they're still fighting
with all their might.

530
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,740
You see, this...
Sights like this are what...

531
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,509
- boxing fans have been waiting to see...
- Can you keep going?

532
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:25,009
- for a long time.
- Lee Gweon Suk!

533
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:27,240
My gosh. This is making my heart flutter.

534
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,750
- Finish her in one blow.
- Box!

535
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,750
With a single punch!

536
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:36,690
The bell has rung.

537
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,049
- The two boxers' match.
- Stop!

538
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,990
Now, we'll move on to the tenth round,

539
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,589
which is the final round.

540
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,259
Well done, Ah Reum.
You're doing a great job.

541
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:49,230
- Coach.
- What? What is it?

542
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:51,130
Don't talk.
Save your energy for the fight.

543
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,900
Don't throw the towel.

544
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,009
Not until I tell you to throw it.

545
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,380
If you go ahead and throw it,

546
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,509
I won't see you ever again.

547
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:07,220
Okay, you brat.

548
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:09,650
Do your best to hold out.

549
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,190
Coach, where's my dad?

550
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,900
I'm not sure. Is he outside?

551
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,000
Is there anything you want to say
before the final round?

552
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,230
Me? Not really.

553
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:25,900
But Mr. Lee called.

554
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,670
He said to pass his message along.

555
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:29,369
My dad?

556
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,740
"In boxing,"

557
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:34,940
"the one who remains standing
at the end is the winner."

558
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,609
"Don't worry about a thing."

559
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,279
"Just do your best until the very end."

560
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:43,119
He tried to act all cool.

561
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:46,019
I know, right?

562
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,190
This is the final round, Suk.

563
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:53,099
Yes.

564
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,430
You got this.

565
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:11,950
The WBC Women's Bantamweight Title Match.

566
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,319
Box!

567
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,220
The final round has begun.

568
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,990
They really should give their all now.

569
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:21,019
They've fought so well
in the last nine rounds.

570
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:24,990
They're slowly raising their guards,

571
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,960
facing each other.

572
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,250
I wanted to meet you,

573
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:51,720
Ms. Lee Gweon Suk.

574
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,920
Then let's run away together.

575
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,630
From the ring.

576
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,730
I, Lee Gweon Suk,

577
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,960
will be sure to lose and retire!

578
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,299
Do you remember what I said
about the most important thing in boxing?

579
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:04,430
It's how you stand.

580
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:06,869
Stand like a big tree,

581
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,009
and keep your movements light.

582
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,009
What are you doing?

583
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,579
Comforting you.

584
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,210
You can tell me everything. I'm all ears.

585
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:19,079
What's important is that
you cannot leave...

586
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,420
even an ounce of regret in that ring.

587
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,750
I've made up my mind.

588
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,259
I'm not going to think...

589
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,819
about losing my match.

590
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,460
All right.

591
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,730
For you.

592
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,799
For everyone who's rooting for me.

593
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:37,099
I'll do my best to win.

594
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:48,309
We can start over.
Let's get the belt back.

595
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,509
What do you think talent is?

596
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,380
It's not giving up.

597
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,390
And you... You have that.

598
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,119
Hey, let's have beef ribs.
Let's get Korean beef.

599
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,490
Treat me to beef...

600
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,490
after I defend my title.

601
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,960
Okay, that's a deal.

602
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
Deal.

603
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,799
- Dreams?
- If I beat Lee Gweon Suk...

604
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:11,230
and become champion
of all four boxing organizations.

605
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,740
Ah Reum.

606
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:14,369
You can do it.

607
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,339
Isn't that how a match works?
And isn't that what boxing is all about?

608
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,430
We must call off today's signing ceremony.

609
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,400
I'll keep my champion belt no matter what.

610
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,000
So fight me.

611
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,309
You're not a boxer.

612
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,940
I'll prove it.

613
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,240
Who will be the one
standing in the ring at the end?

614
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,450
Will it be me or Gweon Suk?

615
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,420
Speak with actions, not words.

616
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,779
So make sure to fight me in the ring
instead of running away.

617
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,190
I...

618
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,819
want to beat you.

619
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,230
Challenge accepted.

620
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
Stop!

621
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,240
The bell has rung.

622
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,309
The match is now over.

623
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:02,450
They both fought very well.

624
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,619
Oftentimes, famous boxers
don't live up to their names,

625
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:12,059
but both boxers really fought
with all their might today.

626
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:13,320
That's how I'd sum it up.

627
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,829
Everyone is applauding them.

628
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:18,929
The audience is giving them
a standing ovation.

629
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,599
I want to applaud them too.

630
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,670
I really am proud of them.

631
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,440
No explanation is needed.
It truly was the best fight.

632
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,139
It doesn't matter who wins this match.

633
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:31,070
I want to say they're both winners.

634
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,590
Now,

635
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,730
I will announce the final results...

636
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,969
of the WBC Women's
Bantamweight Title Match.

637
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,639
Judge Jung Dong Chul.

638
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,800
The score is 93 to 97.

639
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:03,739
Lee Gweon Suk wins.

640
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,039
Yes!

641
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,639
(We love Lee Gweon Suk.)

642
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,809
Judge Jwa Kyung Ho.

643
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,719
The score is 95 to 94.

644
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:18,190
Han Ah Reum wins.

645
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:22,829
Judge Kim Hong Geun.

646
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,909
The score is 94 to 93.

647
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,309
Han Ah Reum wins.

648
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:42,949
With two judges selecting Han Ah Reum
as the winner,

649
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,880
Han Ah Reum wins this match.

650
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
Yes!

651
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,630
(Winner Han Ah Reum)

652
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:12,139
I love you!

653
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,380
- Han Ah Reum!
- Han Ah Reum!

654

00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,940
Let's go.

666
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,579
(Han Ah Reum versus Lee Gweon Suk)

667
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,059
(Gweon Suk, full of laughter,
full of joy, we love you!)

668
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,989
(Lee Gweon Suk)

669
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:11,159
That was amazing!

670
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,340
Mr. Kim. You're lucky.

671
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:02,210
Good job.

672
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,949
Let me go now.

673
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,280
You won.

674
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,989
In sports,

675
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:12,889
do you know
what matters more than the results?

676
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,630
The process.

677
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:18,860
Did they follow the rules?

678
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,800
Did they give their all?

679
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,769
That's the proper attitude for athletes,
isn't it?

680
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:27,699
But you betrayed me
in the middle of the game.

681
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:32,480
So it's only fair that
you pay the price for that.

682
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,690
I had already...

683
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,300
made arrangements
to report you to the police...

684
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,599
and submit the evidence...

685
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,570
if I didn't turn myself in
by the end of today.

686
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,670
You won't be able to get away with this
after killing me.

687
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:40,139
Come on in. Good job.

688
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:41,380
(WBC Women's Bantamweight Title Fight)

689
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:45,820
I'll be right outside.

690
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,219
(Lee Gweon Suk's dressing room)

691
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,300
So how do you feel?

692
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,599
Are you feeling okay?

693
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,769
I feel liberated.

694
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,309
But where did you go
in the middle of my game?

695
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,710
What?

696
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,780
Oh, me? I went to the restroom.

697
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,110
My stomach kept bubbling up
all of a sudden.

698
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:21,349
Seriously.

699
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:26,489
Where's Mr. Kim? Did you see him?

700
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:29,329
He said he'd be sitting ringside.
But I couldn't find him.

701
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:31,989
Gweon Suk.

702
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,300
That jerk, Kim Tae Young, left.

703
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,110
What?

704
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:48,610
He left? Where?

705
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
Well...

706
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:02,159
Are you all right?

707
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:12,769
Suk.

708
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:16,340
He's not here.

709
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,710
What do you mean?

710
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,539
If he's not here,

711
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,179
where is he right now?

712
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,010
He said he was going to the police.

713
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,980
You can't look for him,

714
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:30,250
especially now that you lost the game.

715
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,190
You know why.

716
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:37,929
I know.

717
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:41,360
I know,

718
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,769
but why all of a sudden...

719
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:46,170
I need to talk to him.

720
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,940
No. Do it later.

721
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,639
Talk to him
once he gets in touch with you.

722
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,280
What if he never does?

723
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,289
He made me promise...

724
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:07,960
I would do everything to make sure...

725
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,559
this game didn't get mixed up
with his problem.

726
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,590
Let's do what he wanted us to do.

727
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,699
Please?

728
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,750
It was an intense fight today.

729
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,880
Unfortunately, you lost by decision.

730
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:35,719
What do you think...

731
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:37,219
the cause of your defeat was today?

732
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,460
It's probably...

733
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,630
the level of our affection for the sport.

734
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,159
I had...

735
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:53,469
never liked boxing even for a moment.

736
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:00,380
So you excelled in a sport
you didn't like so much?

737
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,480
You won the gold medal
at the championship.

738
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:06,920
I didn't ask for it,

739
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,690
but I had a talent.

740
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:13,489
On top of that,
I kept training without any breaks.

741
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,260
But I wasn't happy at all.

742
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,659
So I ran away...

743
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:23,800
three years ago.

744
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,039
Anyway, you came back.

745
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:28,400
You showed us
an incredible match today too.

746
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,340
Someone told me...

747
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:37,349
that I shouldn't run away from it.

748
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:42,480
Thanks to him, I was able to face boxing.

749
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,889
But this time, without hiding from it.

750
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,460
When will your next match be?

751
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:56,730
Today,

752
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,869
with this match as my last,

753
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,469
I will say goodbye to boxing.

754
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,780
I want to live a peaceful life,

755
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:11,610
not the life of a boxer.

756
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,719
I want to be happy.

757
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:21,360
I still hate boxing.

758
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:25,789
But I'm really glad that I came back.

759
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:28,559
Thanks to the sport I hate,

760
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,929
I met people who are very dear to me now.

761
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,579
Yes. There.

762
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:45,949
(Giant Boxing)

763
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,679
- Right here?
- Yes. It hurts.

764
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:09,710
What's going on?

765
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:12,409
Is he crying?

766
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,880
They taught me that...

767
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,949
boxing wasn't about winning or losing.

768
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:19,579
I just needed...

769
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,949
to have the will to give it my all
and try to move forward.

770
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,090
I was truly happy...

771
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,659
that my last opponent...

772
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,230
was Ms. Han.

773
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:35,599
I'm pleased I was able to...

774
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:38,670
be a boxer,

775
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:43,309
Thank you.

776
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:16,710
What's important is that...

777
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,010
you cannot leave...

778
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:22,079
even an ounce of regret in that ring.

779
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:25,210
That way,
you'll figure out what you're made of...

780
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:28,079
and what you'll need to do.
It will come to you then.

781

(Han Ah Reum versus Lee Gweon Suk,
WBC Women's Bantamweight Title Fight)

782
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,789
Thanks a lot.

783
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,849
Mister.

784
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,760
Mister!

785
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,260
Where did he go?

786
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,130
Dad.

787
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:27,869
Let me go.

788
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,139
I won't be long.

789
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:35,239
It really won't take long. I swear.

790
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,579
I want to talk to him!

791
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:39,309
I just want to say one thing!

792
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:42,579
I only have to say one thing to him, Dad!

793
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:43,650
Let him go.

794
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,590
The scumbag...

795
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:48,119
did his best for you.

798
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:04,530
I'm back.

799
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:23,190
(1 year later, in the spring)

802

At dawn,

803
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,769
I wake without fail.

804
00:52:04,429 --> 00:52:06,289
I run five kilometers every morning.

805
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,530
This is nothing.

806
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:12,269
Because I'm Lee Gweon Suk.

807
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,650
I used to be alone.

808
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:31,119
But now I know.

809
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:33,860
You're wearing it.

810
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:38,559
I'm not alone.

811
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,269
This man...

812
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:48,670
changed my world.

813
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:54,909
Auntie.

814
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,219
- "Auntie?"
- No, Big Sis.

815
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,179
- "Big Sis?"
- No, Coach.

816
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,820
We practiced from one up to six.

817
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,690
Did you?

818
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,260
We can do it perfectly. Shall we show you?

819
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,230
Ready, go.

820
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,300
One, two, three, four, five, six.

821
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,130
One, two, three...

822
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:20,739
- Well done.
- Kids!

823
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:24,440
See? She's angry again.

824
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:29,079
Head coach said it was fine
as long as we were having fun, didn't he?

825
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:31,309
That's right. You're like a boomer.

826
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:33,619
Let's go and exercise.

827
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,260
(Korean Lightweight
Championship Match, D-25)

828
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,260
Come on.

829
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:43,989
Keep moving. Don't slack off.

830
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:44,989
- Okay.
- Go.

831
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,170
- They'll all be much younger.
- Keep them coming, okay?

832
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:51,170
Go.

833
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:52,199
Right?

834
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,230
What?

835
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:54,769
Come on. Go.

836
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:58,309
Ho Joong's championship match.

837
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,579
He's coming back after five years.

838
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,750
Isn't that cool?

839
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:09,380
You look forlorn and emotional.

840
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:13,920
He's so precious.

841
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,530
Ho Joong. My dear.

842
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,010
Get a grip.

843
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:32,809
You're so out of it.

844
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,309
- Focus!
- Yes, sir.

845
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:41,420
My changed world isn't that special.

846
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,480
Go.

847
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,489
Perhaps...

848
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:46,250
- it's just the same.
- Come on.

849
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,860
It's just that I have grown up a bit.

850
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:50,989
Watch your breathing.

851
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:52,530
Jab.

852
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:53,730
That's it. Jab.

853
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,360
Reach further. Jab.

854
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,400
One, two.

855
00:54:57,769 --> 00:54:59,070
Back, one, two.

856
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:01,369
Don't lower this arm. Keep it up.

857
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:03,199
- Who's up next?
- Me.

858
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,840
To and from.

859
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,980
One, two... Jab.

860
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,179
(4 Major Organizations'
Joint Title Match Training Schedule)

861
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:10,550
One, two, jab.

862
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,349
No, one, two, jab. Like that.

863
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:15,619
That's better. One, two, jab.

864
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,190
Keep going.

865
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:20,719
Okay.

866
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,760
Coach.

867
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:27,699
You have another hangover?

868
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,599
Can you not drink so much? Please?

869
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,369
It's not like I drink every day.

870
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,699
Our new hire is here.
I want to introduce him to you.

871
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:38,670
Where did he go?

872
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,579
Who are you?

873
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:50,989
I'm Han Jae Min. I recently joined About.

874
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:53,659
I'm a fan of yours.
It's an honor to meet you.

875
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,800
(Agent Han Jae Min)

876
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,150
- I look forward to working with you.
- Likewise.

877
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,619
You must be busy these days.

878
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,179
A little.

879
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:23,489
He's very personable.

880
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:24,949
He'll do a good job.

881
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,690
I hope so.

882
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,869
There's so much work to do
with Tae Young gone.

883
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:42,570
About the athletes he used to manage.

884
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,010
Their contracts are coming to an end,

885
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:47,610
and everyone wants to steal them from us.

886
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,440
We won't let anyone steal them from us.

887
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,880
Don't worry.

888
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,480
I'll take great care of them.

889
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,619
Someone's confident.
What are you counting on?

890
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,679
What do you think?

891
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,389
My strong determination
to become the highest-paid agent.

892
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,030
All right. Good luck with that.

893
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:06,130
Cheers.

894
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,929
Let's clink our glasses.

895
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:10,300
Look at you. You've grown up, Sun Jae.

896
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,250
(Horticulture Certificate)

897
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,300
(The guy)

898
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,559
The flower started to open
in just three days.

899
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,869
The exam prep is going well.

900
00:57:58,849 --> 00:57:59,849
(In Loving Memory of Kim Hee Won)

901
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:06,219
Dad, happy birthday.

902
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:09,360
Happy birthday.

903
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:11,360
How are things where you are?

904
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,230
Ye Jun had a follow-up appointment
with his doctor yesterday.

905
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,230
The doctor said
his eyes were looking great.

906
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:20,500
Now, he just needs to go back
for a follow-up checkup once a year.

907
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:22,940
- Aren't you glad?
- Aren't you glad?

908
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:25,610
Oh!

909
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:26,610
(In Loving Memory of Kim Hee Won)

910
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,010
Mom, I guess Uncle Tae Young was here.

911
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:33,280
That's Uncle Tae Young's, isn't it?

912
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,619
(Kim Hee Won)

913
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:40,360
A single shot or a double shot?
A single...

914
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,789
- I'll go for the double...
- The grape-ade for me.

915
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,159
The green grape-ade is good.

916
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:47,659
I'll have the same.

917
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,059
With those doughnuts.

918
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:02,510
My, it's nice and sweet.

919
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,579
The doughnuts are good too.

920
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,590
You still haven't heard from Mr. Kim?

921
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:12,250
I heard he moved out of his place too.

922
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,619
No, not yet.

923
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:18,460
He's so stubborn.

924
00:59:20,699 --> 00:59:22,130
I actually looked it up yesterday.

925
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,929
The court has made
the final decision on his case.

926
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:25,900
Really? It's been announced?

927
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:29,000
He was sentenced to 4 months in prison
and 10 months of probation.

928
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,369
He helped the police
arrest the ring members.

929
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:33,340
It helped mitigate his sentence.

930
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,239
So it's all over, then.

931
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,949
Why isn't he calling us? I'm worried sick.

932
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:41,679
I suppose
he still has things to take care of.

933
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:57,730
This is it.

934
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:00,130
Sir.

935
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:07,980
Mr. Nam Hyun Ki, right?

936
01:00:17,389 --> 01:00:18,550
Let me finish my food first, okay?

937
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,769
It's all over now.

938
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:39,440
Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Kim.

939
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:05,170
(The exam prep is going well.)

940
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:06,670
(Jae Min is her agent.)

941
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,000
(It'd be nice to celebrate with you.)

942
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,199
(You're doing well, right? Text me back.)

943
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:32,360
Life...

944
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:36,260
knocks us down way too often.

945
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,699
But it's not a big deal.

946
01:01:57,449 --> 01:01:58,519
Hi.

947
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,159
You can just get up again.

948
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:06,190
Raise your guard again.

949
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,019
I wanted to meet you,

950
01:02:34,989 --> 01:02:36,059
Ms. Lee Gweon Suk.

951
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,599
It's so good to see you
standing right before me.

952
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,199
Who are you?

953
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:47,639
Are you a reporter?

954
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,440
Oh, right.

955
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,849
This won't do.

956
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,489
Have you got anything else?

957
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:41,090
Where do you want to go?

958
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:43,719
I'll take you there.

959
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:50,900
Right here.

960
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,869
I can't think of a better place.

961
01:04:15,989 --> 01:04:18,860
How not to lose?
It's actually quite simple.

962
01:04:21,429 --> 01:04:23,599
What took you so long, mister?

963
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,429
How much longer
will you call me like that?

964
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:30,199
Then how about Mr. Kim Tae Young?

965
01:04:31,769 --> 01:04:34,210
Goodness. Forget it.

966
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:37,380
Trust yourself a little more,

967
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:40,849
think that you're not alone in this fight,

968
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:43,449
and remain standing in the ring.

969
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,250
- That is...
- That is...

970
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,360
- all you have to do.
- all you have to do.

971
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:50,929
(Thank you for watching My Lovely Boxer.)

972
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,960
(My Lovely Boxer)
