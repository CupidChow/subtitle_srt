I had abducted you to a strange place.

Sure.

116

Go ahead.

00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,682
Ms. Lee Gweon Suk publicly challenged you.

118

Will you accept her challenge?

119
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:50,851
You didn't release
any official announcements.

120
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,091
A lot of people are wondering
if you're running away from the fight.

121
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:55,692
I...

122
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:57,591
neither hide...

123
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,692
nor run away.

124
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:01,831
I will gladly accept...

125
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,131
Ms. Lee's challenge.

126
00:11:04,802 --> 00:11:06,001
Gosh, she's so cool.

127
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:09,501
Then is there anything
you would like to say to Ms. Lee...

128
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,101
who challenged you?

129
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:15,912
I guess Ms. Lee...

130
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:19,341
wants to take my belt.

131
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:22,152
You're always welcome here.

132
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:24,251
Come and visit me.

133
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,652

(Sports K)

135
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:29,892
You're so cool, Ah Reum!

136
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:31,922
Gosh.
She's already trying to psych you out.

137
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:33,162
You're the best, world champion!

138
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:34,392
I'm fine.

139
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:37,361
She's only verbally attacking me today
at least.

140
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,341
This revenge match will take place
after three years.

141
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:46,302
This must feel quite different
from other matches.

142
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:48,142
Please tell us
how determined you are to win this fight.

143
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:51,282
I'm not determined to win this fight.

144
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,081
I'll just prove it to her.

145
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:54,682
What do you mean?

146
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,121
Even if Ms. Lee hadn't run away
three years ago,

147
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,822
I would still have won the fight.

148
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:02,822
And I will win this fight again.

149
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:07,062
People call Ms. Lee the Genius Boxer.

150
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:09,032
She's the strongest amateur boxer
and hasn't lost a single match yet.

151
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:12,432
Some people said that
you were actually lucky...

152
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:15,731
that the match was canceled
three years ago.

153
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,371
Are you sure you're not one of them?

154
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:25,542
I'm not a genius boxer.

155
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:27,481
My hard work got me here.

156
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:31,881
But I don't believe
hard work is always rewarded.

157
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:34,792
Hard work...

158
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:37,721
betrays us way too often.

159
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:40,591
Staying in the ring...

160
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:43,662
instead of giving up
after knowing all that.

161
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,672
That's my talent.

162
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:51,902
I'll show everyone...

163
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:56,111
which one of us will remain in the ring
until the end. Me...

164
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,611
or Lee Gweon Suk.

165
00:12:58,711 --> 00:12:59,981
Goodness.

166
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:01,711
That was cool.

167
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:12,562
I got goosebumps.

168
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,032
Whose side are you on?

169
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:17,761
Right.

170
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,601
Gosh, she's great at giving interviews.

171
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,672
There will be a lot of tension
in this match.

172
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:27,611
Let's get this momentum going
and sell out all the tickets.

173
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:28,611
Okay?

174
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:30,312
We should.

175
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:36,682
What happened to his face?

176
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,081
The son of a witch must have...

177
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:41,491
I guess he got beaten up.

178
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:42,851
It happens from time to time.

179
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:44,562
Right.

180
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:51,062
Why would two men video-call each other?

181
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:53,432
I just talked to Ye Jun,
and it went to video automatically.

182
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:56,131
You didn't pick up yesterday
when I called after I landed.

183
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:59,072
I had business.

184
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,871
How's the dorm? Is it uncomfortable?

185
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:04,282
It's bearable. I have the room to myself.

186
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:06,312
I think they'll let me play.

187
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:09,211
This season's almost over,
so I thought I'd have to wait.

188
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,981
The manager suggested I play.

189
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:13,322
I'll call when the date's set.

190
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:14,621
Okay, Hee Won.

191
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:18,922
- Tae Young.
- Yes?

192
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:23,532
Next year, how many wins do you want?

193
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,131
Fifteen.

194
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,601
Hey.

195
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:32,101
Ten.

196
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:34,672
Okay, deal.

197
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:36,942
Take care.

198
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,522
I neither hide...

199
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,662
nor run away.

200
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,802
I'll show everyone...

201
00:14:57,802 --> 00:15:00,871
which one of us will remain in the ring
until the end. Me...

202
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:02,831
or Lee Gweon Suk.

203
00:15:10,282 --> 00:15:13,652
Darn it. You don't know anything.

204
00:15:17,522 --> 00:15:18,621
What's wrong, Coach?

205
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:21,991
It's nothing at all.

206
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,961
It's not nothing.

207
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:31,731
- It's something.
- It's not.

208
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:39,101
"Why are you back? Do you need money?"

209
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:40,672
"You're so shameless."

210
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,172
"Do you think nothing of a champion?"

211
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,741
Don't waste your breath. Stop reading.

212
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,851
There was some negativity
before your return match,

213
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,182
and there is more now.

214
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,422
They're not wrong.

215
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:05,361
Let's talk. You too.

216
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:08,601
A loss by decision?

217
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:14,172
If I'm going to lose,
I'd rather be knocked out.

218
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:16,312
There won't be a controversy then.

219
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:17,812
We can't go for a KO.

220
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,182
You'll look too bad.

221
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:21,581
They might suspect you.

222
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,812
I don't care.

223
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:25,581
Why take the high road
when there's an easier way?

224
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:27,952
It'll only mess up the match.

225
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:29,621
How would it mess up the match?

226
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,562
You keep up with her, then barely lose.

227
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:33,162
There will be no problem.

228
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:36,861
Whatever. How I lose is up to me.

229
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:39,432
I'll be in the ring on my own.

230
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,542
Tae Young.

231
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,812
Gweon Suk's right.

232
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,682
A loss by decision is risky.

233
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,121
It might jeopardize her retirement.

234
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,851
I won't let her retire.

235
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:03,692
I'm sending her to the US after this.

236
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:06,991
What? She's counting down
to the day she reties.

237
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:08,692
She's retaliating because...

238
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,932
boxing used to stress her out so bad.

239
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,801
In a much better environment,

240
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,971
I'll let her compete
to her heart's content.

241
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,501
Does that look like a girl
who's sick of boxing?

242
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:21,112
You too said she was wasting her talent.

243
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:23,882
Yes, but still.

244
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:26,711
It's fine to lose.

245
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:28,682
Just not with a KO.

246
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:31,251
We must leave the option open
for a comeback in the US.

247
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:40,531
(Emperor Diet Boxing)

248
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:50,541
(Emperor Diet Boxing)

249
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,981
Do you like boxing?

250
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:00,352
- What?
- Do you like boxing?

251
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:03,652
I do.

252
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:07,221
The coach was an Asian champion.

253
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,721
He's good,
and the facility here is awesome.

254
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,122
The membership fee.

255
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:14,832
Is it cheap?

256
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:18,362
There's more to it than cost-efficiency.

257
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,372
It's your lucky day.

258
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:25,041
You get 20 percent off
the first six months of basic training.

259
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:35,582
You're a great salesman.

260
00:18:38,922 --> 00:18:43,521
What the... Ms. Jo, wait.

261
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:45,422
(You're the prettiest
when you throw punches.)

262
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:53,531
I don't accept other pros.

263
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,602
People come here to lose weight.

264
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:56,672
Can't you tell?

265
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,602
What about her, then?

266
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:02,811
(Let's get pretty. You trust me, right?)

267
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:04,741
She's an exception.

268
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:07,481
You're discriminating.

269
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:09,112
It's not discrimination.

270
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:12,382
Coach.

271
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:15,991
Take it. It's my coach.

272
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:19,122
Take it, already.

273
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,561
Hello, I'm...

274
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:28,071
Hello, sir. Gosh.

275
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:33,372
Oh. I see.

276
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:35,142
Bang.

277
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:39,741
Guys.

278
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:43,481
My boxing gym closed down.

279
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:44,821
(Our A Ra's the best!)

280
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:46,051
(What?)

281
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,291
(What do you do now, then?)

282
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,021
So I moved to a new gym.

283
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:52,192
Which one is it?

284
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,632
I'm now at...

285
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,162
Ta-da.

286
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:00,402
Can you not film us too?

287
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:03,071
Will you look at my new coach?

288
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:05,872
He refuses to be on camera
but he's promoting his business.

289
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:09,912
He offers 20 percent off basic training.

290
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:14,352
Come to Emperor Diet Boxing,
the place to go...

291
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:16,211
if you want to lose weight.

292
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,852
I'll train for much better matches here.

293
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,221
See you. Take care.

294
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:22,592
Bye.

295
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,602
Why are you always in
some kind of trouble?

296
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:32,332
Why are you buying me a drink?

297
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:33,872
Do you come here often?

298
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:35,932
Not often. Only when I feel like drinking.

299
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:41,071
I recently got a tip-off.

300
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:42,571
What about?

301
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:46,142
The guys...

302
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:49,182
are coming back to the baseball games.

303
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:50,952
What?

304
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:53,352
Come on. You know who I mean.

305
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,321
The illegal gamblers. The match-fixers.

306
00:20:57,862 --> 00:20:59,761
You remember Kang Tae Hoon, don't you?

307
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,192
It was a huge deal four years ago.

308
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:04,001
Match fixing.

309
00:21:04,702 --> 00:21:07,202
I thought things had quietened down.

310
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:10,202
Have you heard anything about it?

311
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:16,571
I'm not a reporter.

312
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,781
You're the first to tell me about them.

313
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,422
As if I am.

314
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:32,862
Oh, right. I saw Kim Hee Won
before he left for Taiwan.

315
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:34,031
Hee Won?

316
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,561
That was this neighborhood too.

317
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:39,662
The mall across the road.

318
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,771
He was with men I'd never seen before.

319
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:49,771
They must've been his friends.

320
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:56,382
He said they were his seniors.

321
00:21:57,352 --> 00:21:58,551
Did he reach Taiwan safely?

322
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:01,092
You bet.

323
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:02,952
I saw him off.

324
00:22:14,763 --> 00:22:15,833
Are you okay?

325
00:22:17,662 --> 00:22:19,333
My goodness.

326
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,773
- My word.
- Tae Young.

327
00:22:24,472 --> 00:22:26,142
What a mess.

328
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:29,383
What's going on? Where's Gweon Suk?

329
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:30,513
She went to buy some water.

330
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:34,553
She drinks much less
than she looks like she can handle.

331
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:37,853
Hey.

332
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:41,692
Don't I look like I can't drink much?

333
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:44,932
What happened?

334
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,162
Her boxing gym closed down.

335
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:50,603
My senior asked me, so I couldn't say no.

336
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:52,873
But what about Gweon Suk's training?

337
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:54,402
I'll pay more attention to her.

338
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:56,002
I won't let her find out.

339
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:58,513
You figure it out, then.

340
00:22:58,773 --> 00:22:59,773
I don't know.

341
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:05,513
Hey.

342
00:23:07,212 --> 00:23:08,222
A Ra.

343
00:23:13,722 --> 00:23:14,922
Hey, can you take Gweon Suk home?

344
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:16,922
I'll make sure A Ra sobers up
and gets home safely.

345
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:18,593
I can go home by myself.

346
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:20,563
- No, you can't.
- No, you can't.

347
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:34,142
Don't you want to learn how to box?

348
00:23:35,742 --> 00:23:36,742
That's random.

349
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:40,252
I'm only suggesting it...

350
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:41,883
because you got beaten up.

351
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,152
Are you worried about me?

352
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,692
Don't do anything that would give someone
a reason to beat you up.

353
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:50,992
My goodness. So you are worried about me.

354
00:23:51,593 --> 00:23:54,593
Then what?
"Nice one. That serves you right."

355
00:23:54,593 --> 00:23:55,603
Shall I say that instead?

356
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,232
Gosh. You always have something to say,
don't you?

357
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:01,902
About my phone.

358
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,873
How did you do that?

359
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:07,442
- Do what?
- You know, the water damage.

360
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,083
They said it couldn't be repaired.

361
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:11,813
How did you fix it?

362
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:13,712
Aren't you grateful?

363
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,152
Look at you.
I can see that you were touched.

364
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,422
Jae Min bought me a new phone.

365
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:23,692
Why are you telling me this just now?

366
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:26,892
Because you never asked.

367
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:29,063
Your pockets must've been very heavy.

368
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:30,633
Well, they weren't too bad.

369
00:24:32,702 --> 00:24:33,702
Don't smile.

370
00:24:37,073 --> 00:24:38,073
Thank you.

371
00:24:38,942 --> 00:24:41,442
- Thanks to you, I restored all the data.
- Forget it.

372
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:43,912
I'll do as you say.

373
00:24:47,883 --> 00:24:48,883
The match.

374
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:52,192
All of a sudden?

375
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:55,992
When I watched Ah Reum's interview today,

376
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,932
I felt my competitive juices flowing.

377
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:01,263
To tell you the truth,

378
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:04,702
I don't want to lose with a KO either.

379
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:08,843
Well, I've never been knocked out.

380
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:11,202
I know she's strong,

381
00:25:11,472 --> 00:25:13,412
so she may be able to knock me out.

382
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,982
But I promise you
that I won't lose pathetically.

383
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:22,922
- Instead...
- Hold on.

384
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,422
"Instead?"

385
00:25:29,222 --> 00:25:30,363
Stop. No.

386
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:34,333
What do you think I'll say?

387
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,932
Whatever it is, my answer is no.

388
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:44,472
(Fun, Exciting Boxing Experience)

389
00:25:44,873 --> 00:25:45,873
Hi, kids!

390
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:49,013
- Ms. Yu Ri!
- Ms. Yu Ri!

391
00:25:49,343 --> 00:25:52,313
- Ms. Yu Ri!
- Ms. Yu Ri!

392
00:25:52,313 --> 00:25:55,922
- Ms. Yu Ri.
- We missed you, Ms. Yu Ri.

393
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:58,053
- We missed you.
- We missed you so much.

394
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,152
- We missed you, Ms. Yu Ri.
- Welcome back.

395
00:26:00,722 --> 00:26:03,263
- Ms. Yu Ri!
- I really missed you.

396
00:26:04,692 --> 00:26:06,293
Once upon a time,

397
00:26:06,763 --> 00:26:09,563
a scary tiger lived.

398
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:15,573
That tiger liked to bother children.

399
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:23,313
At that moment,

400
00:26:24,113 --> 00:26:25,783
Red Cape showed up.

401
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:38,533
Please clap along.

402
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:40,133
It'll give Red Cape
the strength she needs.

403
00:26:40,692 --> 00:26:42,162
- You've got this!
- You've got this!

404
00:26:42,363 --> 00:26:43,763
- You've got this!
- You've got this!

405
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:45,472
- You've got this!
- You've got this!

406
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:06,093
- Lee Gweon Suk!
- Lee Gweon Suk!

407
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:07,952
- Lee Gweon Suk!
- Lee Gweon Suk!

408
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:10,462
Hi, friends!

409
00:27:10,692 --> 00:27:12,892
- Hello.
- Hello.

410
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:15,833
Today, I'll teach you...

411
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,373
how you can bravely fight a bad monster.

412
00:27:18,573 --> 00:27:20,273
You can observe me
and do what I show you, right?

413
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:22,002
- Yes!
- Yes!

414
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:24,043
Never hit your friends.

415
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:27,513
- "Never hit your friends."
- "Never hit your friends."

416
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,883
Ready, go.

417
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:30,712
One, two.

418
00:27:31,113 --> 00:27:32,553
- One, two.
- One, two.

419
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:33,813
One, two.

420
00:27:33,813 --> 00:27:35,383
- One, two.
- One, two.

421
00:27:35,383 --> 00:27:36,452
One, two.

422
00:27:36,452 --> 00:27:37,823
- One, two.
- One, two.

423
00:27:41,152 --> 00:27:43,692
I'll let this one go,
but this should not happen again.

424
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:47,533
- Sorry?
- This is for promoting the kindergarten.

425
00:27:48,162 --> 00:27:50,303
With these things,
you'll have to consult me first.

426
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:51,672
Do not contact my athletes directly.

427
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:52,672
Oh, I see.

428
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:55,873
Had I consulted you first,

429
00:27:56,273 --> 00:27:57,402
you would've turned it down.

430
00:27:57,402 --> 00:27:58,513
Yes, I would have.

431
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,583
Then we wouldn't have been able to see
how happy Gweon Suk was today.

432
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:09,853
I'm not trying to promote the business.
Don't get the wrong idea.

433
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:13,392
Today,

434
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:15,962
I organized this for Gweon Suk.

435
00:28:17,123 --> 00:28:18,123
I wanted to make her smile.

436
00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:23,833
All right. This time,

437
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:26,672
you must all remember
the lethal move I used to beat the tiger.

438
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:27,833
- Yes!
- Yes!

439
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,902
We'll try the uppercut this time.

440
00:28:30,472 --> 00:28:31,813
Punch!

441
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,843
All right.
Do you all want to give it a shot?

442
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:38,813
Punch!

443
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:40,083
- Punch!
- Punch!

444
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,652
Now, shall we connect it
to the move you learned earlier?

445
00:28:42,652 --> 00:28:44,682
One, two. Punch!

446
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,992
- One, two. Punch!
- One, two. Punch!

447
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:50,063
My gosh. Great job!

448
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:03,972
Oh, are you...

449
00:29:03,972 --> 00:29:05,142
Yes, hello.

450
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:07,613
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Hee Won's friend.

451
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,142
I'm here because of
Ye Jun's appointment today.

452
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:15,053
Hello.

453
00:29:15,883 --> 00:29:17,922
Ye Jun, say hello.

454
00:29:18,182 --> 00:29:20,853
You know,
the doctor who's going to fix your eyes.

455
00:29:20,853 --> 00:29:22,492
He helped us
get an appointment with the doctor.

456
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:23,922
The doctor is very famous,

457
00:29:23,922 --> 00:29:25,263
so it was hard
to get an appointment with him.

458
00:29:36,502 --> 00:29:37,902
Don't make me wait.

459
00:29:38,073 --> 00:29:39,672
I came all the way here.

460
00:29:42,343 --> 00:29:43,583
Did someone punch you?

461
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,752
Why bother asking? It's not like
you're going to get punched in my place.

462
00:29:47,682 --> 00:29:48,682
Let's go.

463
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:53,692
Remember that you aren't young anymore.
You think you're still in your 20s.

464
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:56,823
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

465
00:29:57,222 --> 00:29:58,593
Hey, how is Ah Reum doing?

466
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:04,902
Sorry.

467
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:13,013
I'm happy.

468
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:15,073
I've never felt so happy.

469
00:30:16,912 --> 00:30:18,013
It's all thanks to you.

470
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:20,883
I'm glad I invited you.

471
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:27,992
How are things between you
and your agent these days?

472
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:32,492
Well, we have our moments.

473
00:30:34,063 --> 00:30:35,063
Why?

474
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:37,103
I'm a little worried.

475
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:39,202
Why are you worried?

476
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:40,533
You said...

477
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:42,742
he was intense.

478
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,313
I was worried about you,
so I asked around.

479
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,212
And he's the real son of a witch.

480
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:52,752
He's notorious
for recruiting talented athletes...

481
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:55,113
and making them retire
after sucking everything out of them.

482
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:57,452
He's not like that.

483
00:30:57,452 --> 00:30:58,523
How do you know?

484
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,752
They're just rumors.

485
00:31:00,922 --> 00:31:02,563
He's the type
that could be misunderstood easily.

486
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:05,363
You signed a one-off contract
for two matches.

487
00:31:06,192 --> 00:31:07,793
I looked into it. Everyone said...

488
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:09,363
you wouldn't even be paid properly
under such conditions.

489
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:10,603
As for the one-off contract,

490
00:31:11,462 --> 00:31:12,732
I requested it.

491
00:31:16,103 --> 00:31:18,172
Fine. Forget about the contract, then.

492
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,313
What kind of agent
lets an athlete stay at his place?

493
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:23,412
We had no choice.

494
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:25,283
People kept coming to see me,

495
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:27,412
so he said it'd be dangerous
to stay at a hotel.

496
00:31:27,412 --> 00:31:29,283
Why do you keep defending him?

497
00:31:31,252 --> 00:31:32,252
It's not that.

498
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:36,692
I mean...

499
00:31:37,793 --> 00:31:38,793
Sorry.

500
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:40,492
I overreacted.

501
00:31:43,462 --> 00:31:44,462
No.

502
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:48,103
I was going to tell you later,

503
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,442
but I should just tell you now.

504
00:31:53,843 --> 00:31:55,073
I've handed in my resignation.

505
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:17,033
You resigned?

506
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:18,603
Yes, today.

507
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,603
How about you start working with me...

508
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:22,103
after this title match?

509
00:32:22,103 --> 00:32:23,103
With you?

510
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:24,402
Yes.

511
00:32:25,002 --> 00:32:26,813
Let's move to a different agency together.

512
00:32:27,043 --> 00:32:28,472
There's an agency that's showing interest.

513
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,712
They promised to give you
all the support you need.

514
00:32:31,813 --> 00:32:33,113
You don't have to answer this today.

515
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:35,323
Think about it
until the match is over and...

516
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:36,353
I don't want...

517
00:32:37,652 --> 00:32:39,152
to work with you in the boxing industry.

518
00:32:42,523 --> 00:32:43,523
Why not?

519
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,392
Do you think I'll do a bad job?

520
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:48,563
No, it's not that.

521
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:51,033
I can do a better job
than Kim Tae Young at least.

522
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:03,313
I'm going to quit boxing.

523
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:05,952
What?

524
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,083
When?

525
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:11,523
After the title match.

526
00:33:17,093 --> 00:33:18,162
Why?

527
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:24,462
I hate boxing.

528
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,533
I had never liked it even for a moment.

529
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,313
Sweetie.

530
00:33:34,573 --> 00:33:36,783
Why are you telling me that now?

531
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:39,652
Look at what you made me do.

532
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:41,452
You got my hopes up and got me excited.

533
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:45,593
I'm a joke, aren't I?

534
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:19,252
Hello.

535
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:21,692
Hello.

536
00:34:23,493 --> 00:34:24,993
I thought you were busy.

537
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:27,593
I had to handle some stuff. Get in.

538
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,033
I'm good. I'm going to walk.

539
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:32,633
Your face got puffy.

540
00:34:33,203 --> 00:34:34,332
Did something happen?

541
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,073
No.

542
00:34:40,343 --> 00:34:42,212
Don't go anywhere. Come home straight.

543
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,913
Gosh, that nagging.

544
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:48,113
We'll get going first. See you then.

545
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,533
You must be cold. Come on in.

546
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:11,272
I'm here as a driver.

547
00:35:11,772 --> 00:35:14,172
Did you know he cracked his ribs?

548
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,343
Really?

549
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:17,482
Gosh. Don't make a fuss.

550
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,312
It's just a hairline fracture. It'll heal
in two weeks with some medication.

551
00:35:20,312 --> 00:35:21,883
Is it okay for you to go around like this?

552
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:23,582
Then you have to take the medicine.

553
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:26,823
He likes to worsen his condition.

554
00:35:26,823 --> 00:35:28,622
He hates going to the hospital
like a little kid.

555
00:35:29,422 --> 00:35:30,792
If I hadn't spotted his injury,

556
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:31,993
he wouldn't have gone
to the hospital today.

557
00:35:32,962 --> 00:35:34,962
Why are you taking off your jacket?
You're leaving soon.

558
00:35:34,962 --> 00:35:37,502
Gosh, I want to warm up my body
before I leave.

559
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:39,772
He hates shots too.

560
00:35:41,872 --> 00:35:43,272
That's enough.

561
00:35:43,473 --> 00:35:44,703
I'll make coffee.

562
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:48,172
I'll do it.

563
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:50,042
It's fine. I know where everything is.

564
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:52,042
I bought a lot of stuff for this house.

565
00:35:53,113 --> 00:35:54,183
And they're still here.

566
00:36:07,163 --> 00:36:08,433
How's the training going?

567
00:36:09,102 --> 00:36:10,962
Tae Young can be
a bit suffocating at times.

568
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:13,033
Yes, a bit.

569
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:15,433
He's always been that.
He likes to nag his athletes.

570
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:17,502
He goes all-in on his athletes.

571
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,542
Was he like this with you too?

572
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:22,883
Don't even get me started.

573
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:30,852
But come to think of it,
being his athlete was nice.

574
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:35,093
He was always by my side.

575
00:36:41,893 --> 00:36:43,433
That was quick.

576
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:45,002
I was having fun, badmouthing you.

577
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,533
What are you doing there? Come here.

578
00:36:59,413 --> 00:37:00,652
This brings back old memories.

579
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:06,323
You don't have a photo of Ms. Lee
on the wall.

580
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:07,692
Why didn't you hang one?

581
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,393
Oh, that.

582
00:37:12,122 --> 00:37:13,692
I haven't brought it from my office yet.

583
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,363
If you're waiting to hang...

584
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:20,502
a photo of her with the champion belt,
you'd better quit dreaming.

585
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:26,372
You too.
We're not going to let you take it.

586
00:37:29,243 --> 00:37:31,042
I'll go to my room now.

587
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:33,982
- Enjoy your coffee. Goodnight.
- Rest up.

588
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:42,263
I told you to just leave.

589
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:44,393
I'm injured. Why are we going on a walk?

590
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,593
Let's just walk for a bit.

591
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:48,692
It's only a hairline fracture anyway.

592
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:50,033
Don't play hard-to-get.

593
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:53,033
Let's go and get you a cab then.

594
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:54,803
You're so mean.

595
00:37:55,602 --> 00:37:56,743
Yes, I'm mean.

596
00:38:00,243 --> 00:38:02,542
I've been thinking about why
I wanted Ms. Han to fight Ms. Lee...

597
00:38:03,212 --> 00:38:05,652
and why I wanted us to win this fight.

598
00:38:05,652 --> 00:38:06,712
And?

599
00:38:07,883 --> 00:38:09,852
The 70 percent of my reason was you.

600
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,453
What do you mean?

601
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:16,062
I'm going to beat you no matter what.

602
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:20,893
If I beat you,
do you want to give us another shot?

603
00:38:27,902 --> 00:38:30,303
Work hard. I'll go upstairs.

604
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:35,013
What was that? My cab isn't here yet.

605
00:38:35,843 --> 00:38:37,542
You'd better pay me back
for taking care of you today.

606
00:38:37,843 --> 00:38:39,312
Buy me drinks.

607
00:39:04,402 --> 00:39:05,473
Are you sleeping?

608
00:39:06,473 --> 00:39:09,542
What? You didn't leave?

609
00:39:09,942 --> 00:39:12,113
Why did you barge into my room?

610
00:39:12,212 --> 00:39:13,582
Hey, I knocked.

611
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,223
I didn't say you could come in.

612
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:20,223
- Did you cry?
- I didn't.

613
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:23,723
You did cry. Your eyes are puffy.

614
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,292
Gosh. Come on.

615
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:34,872
What happened with Han Jae Min?

616
00:39:35,602 --> 00:39:37,143
Don't bring him up.

617
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:38,803
What's wrong?

618
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:40,413
What did he do to you?

619
00:39:40,973 --> 00:39:42,042
Tell me.

620
00:39:50,183 --> 00:39:51,453
We had a fight...

621
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:55,152
because we weren't on the same page.

622
00:39:59,562 --> 00:40:01,232
Stop asking me questions. Just leave.

623
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,002
I want to be left alone.

624
00:40:10,272 --> 00:40:11,272
Okay.

625
00:40:16,743 --> 00:40:19,113
- As for the photos in the living room...
- It's okay.

626
00:40:20,053 --> 00:40:22,312
I'm not your real athlete anyway.

627
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:24,482
I know that.

628
00:40:27,622 --> 00:40:28,652
Sleep tight.

629
00:40:38,732 --> 00:40:40,133
Honey.

630
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:41,672
Dad, hello.

631
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:45,042
Honey, they scheduled the procedure
for Ye Jun's eyes.

632
00:40:45,203 --> 00:40:47,843
We kept calling you yesterday,
but you didn't answer your phone.

633
00:40:47,843 --> 00:40:49,312
Oh, really?

634
00:40:49,312 --> 00:40:50,913
Your junior didn't tell you?

635
00:40:50,913 --> 00:40:53,082
You personally asked him to help Ye Jun.

636
00:40:53,082 --> 00:40:55,752
Without his help,
it would have taken a year.

637
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:58,652
Right. The doctor said...

638
00:40:58,652 --> 00:41:01,352
that the condition of Ye Jun's eyes
wasn't bad.

639
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:05,562
Ye Jun's prognosis will be good
as long as he gets the procedure.

640
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:06,663
Isn't that great news?

641
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,962
Yes. That's great news.

642
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:13,433
I have to go to my training now.

643
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:15,232
I'll call you later tonight.

644
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:17,703
Okay. Ye Jun, say bye.

645
00:41:18,272 --> 00:41:21,143
Dad, bye. Strikeout!

646
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:23,212
Bye.

647
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:38,223
(Kim Tae Young)

648
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:46,372
(Mr. Kim at Sky)

649
00:42:03,752 --> 00:42:06,022
(Jae Min)

650
00:42:27,343 --> 00:42:28,513
You didn't answer my call.

651
00:42:30,812 --> 00:42:32,683
You're not avoiding me, right?

652
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:34,783
No.

653
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:38,683
I'm sorry. I blew up on you, didn't I?

654
00:42:40,493 --> 00:42:41,553
You were surprised, weren't you?

655
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:44,663
I should have told you
about my plan first.

656
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:47,792
Gweon Suk.

657
00:42:49,562 --> 00:42:51,462
Can you not think about it?

658
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,172
At least until after your match.

659
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:56,073
You've been alone so far,

660
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,172
but now you have me.

661
00:42:59,102 --> 00:43:01,343
Give me a chance. I won't let you down.

662
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:08,482
Sweetie.

663
00:43:11,082 --> 00:43:12,622
I've already made up my mind.

664
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:16,823
Sorry.

665
00:43:19,893 --> 00:43:20,893
I...

666
00:43:21,962 --> 00:43:24,232
I quit kindergarten to work with you.

667
00:43:25,332 --> 00:43:27,602
I tried to become someone you needed.

668
00:43:29,643 --> 00:43:31,402
Can you even say you'll think about it?

669
00:43:33,743 --> 00:43:35,113
It's just a month.

670
00:43:35,372 --> 00:43:37,582
- Think about it and...
- Then...

671
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:42,383
If I decide to quit boxing then,

672
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:47,953
will you still be there for me?

673
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:00,172
Do you think I'm pathetic too?

674
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:02,203
Sweetie.

675
00:44:06,073 --> 00:44:08,212
You think
I don't give much thought to life.

676
00:44:08,473 --> 00:44:09,683
I don't think so.

677
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:11,383
Then why act like this...

678
00:44:11,383 --> 00:44:12,542
when we talk about work?

679
00:44:13,752 --> 00:44:15,352
Do you think you're a star?

680
00:44:16,352 --> 00:44:19,152
Who do you think you are
to toy with me like this?

681
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:23,163
How will you make up for
the time I wasted on you?

682
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:34,473
That's enough.

683
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:39,942
She said no.

684
00:44:58,393 --> 00:45:00,933
Should I have punched him?

685
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:02,832
Shall I go after him?

686
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:05,303
We're not in a ring.

687
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,672
Why would you punch someone?

688
00:45:14,413 --> 00:45:15,542
Skip training today.

689
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:17,113
Let's get everyone...

690
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:18,982
and have jokbal.

691
00:45:20,252 --> 00:45:21,283
Forget it.

692
00:45:23,553 --> 00:45:25,053
I'm going home.

693
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,223
Walk back really slowly.

694
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,900
She's so tenacious.

695
00:46:49,699 --> 00:46:51,810
She's already made up for yesterday's
missed training already.

696
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:54,009
You drank for months...

697
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:55,239
when you broke up with Soo Yeon.

698
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,449
Suk. That's enough.

699
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,290
Take a break.

700
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:20,839
(Power Off)

701
00:47:53,569 --> 00:47:54,569
What are you doing?

702
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:58,910
She's been in there for ages.

703
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,810
My goodness.

704
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:06,810
(You're the prettiest
when you throw punches.)

705
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,020
Gweon Suk.

706
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,890
What are you doing?

707
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:18,589
Why the huge fuss?

708
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,600
I have a lot on my mind.

709
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:22,929
Are you okay?

710
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,870
Coach, tell this guy to leave.

711
00:48:26,429 --> 00:48:28,000
He's disrupting my training.

712
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,940
What?

713
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,480
You're done for the day.

714
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:41,679
Get changed.

715
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,120
Why would you order tteokbokki?

716
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,359
I can afford more.

717
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,960
There are times when you crave something.

718
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,359
Today, it's tteokbokki.

719
00:48:58,399 --> 00:49:00,870
A few days ago,
I had to just watch someone enjoy it.

720
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:07,910
You've eaten five pieces already.

721
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:10,810
Eat just two more, and that's one portion.

722
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,109
Seriously?

723
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,580
Are you here to stress me out?

724
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:16,819
Eat up, then.

725
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:18,219
It's your weight to lose.

726
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:19,290
You're so mean.

727
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,359
One's first love...

728
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:29,759
always ends in a breakup.

729
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,640
Even if it feels like you'll die,

730
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,370
you somehow...

731
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:41,480
learn to move on and forget.

732
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,739
Even so,

733
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,580
I didn't think it would end so quickly.

734
00:49:48,049 --> 00:49:50,279
It means
there's a better guy out there for you.

735
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,089
Anyway,
I think that wasn't even your first love.

736
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:59,259
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

737
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,069
Do you want to go somewhere?

738
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,699
I'll take you, to celebrate your breakup.

739
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,649
There is one place.

740
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:19,649
Where's that?

741
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:22,679
My home.

742
00:50:23,379 --> 00:50:25,149
Where I lived with my parents.

743
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,719
You can just go.

744
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:29,219
I ran away from home.

745
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:31,190
On the rooftop...

746
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,199
is a small garden my mom made.

747
00:50:35,029 --> 00:50:36,359
I bet it's gone now.

748
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,569
I'm pretty sure Dad killed everything.

749
00:50:43,069 --> 00:50:44,069
Then how about...

750
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,640
we go to a botanical garden?

751
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,679
For real?

752
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,980
I want to see a baobab tree.

753
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:53,850
A baobab tree?

754
00:50:55,879 --> 00:50:57,989
Isn't that in space?
On the Little Prince's planet?

755
00:50:57,989 --> 00:51:00,350
There's one
in a botanical garden here too.

756
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,120
You want to see the weirdest of things.

757
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,460
Let's go on your birthday.

758
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:06,790
Are you sure?

759
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:09,330
Promise.

760
00:51:13,929 --> 00:51:16,399
First, can you stop being angry?

761
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:18,670
What?

762
00:51:23,509 --> 00:51:26,210
"Jo A Ra's
a talent-less attention-seeker."

763
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:28,620
"It shows that she was never loved."

764
00:51:31,819 --> 00:51:32,819
Hey.

765
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:36,420
My mom loves me loads.

766
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:38,859
Mom, I love you.

767
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:45,699
See?

768
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:46,969
That's what you do.

769
00:51:47,029 --> 00:51:48,370
She's pretty good.

770
00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:50,569
Do I have to go that far?

771
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,609
I'm pretty?

772
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:56,179
Thanks. I love you.

773
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,020
You don't have to go that far.

774
00:52:03,149 --> 00:52:04,149
Okay.

775
00:52:05,649 --> 00:52:07,250
"Gweon Suk's punches..."

776
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,089
"make me doubt her gender."

777
00:52:09,819 --> 00:52:11,330
"I bet her beard grows at night."

778
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,500
This is a compliment, right?

779
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,429
Could you recommend a good razor?

780
00:52:18,629 --> 00:52:21,569
"She has a resting witch face."

781
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,440
Gosh.

782
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,370
Sorry.

783
00:52:28,009 --> 00:52:29,480
"She never had a boyfriend."

784
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,750
"Did she even hold hands with a guy?"

785
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,949
"It shows on her face."

786
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,420
I have...

787
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,149
had a boyfriend.

788
00:52:41,319 --> 00:52:43,960
It was short,
and it was both bitter and sweet.

789
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:46,129
Dating is all about reality.

790
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:48,460
I bet you never dated.

791
00:52:48,529 --> 00:52:50,969
I suggest you try it out.

792
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,739
(Battery)

793
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,009
Hey, Hee Won.

794
00:53:07,379 --> 00:53:08,779
(33rd Bonghwangdaeki National High School
Baseball Championship, Yujin High School)

795
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,199
Thank you.

796
00:53:22,929 --> 00:53:25,670
When Ye Jun gets home,
he'll be so excited.

797
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:28,469
He hasn't been allowed
to play video games because of his eyes.

798
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,839
When will he undergo the procedure?

799
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,410
In two weeks.

800
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,310
I've been so anxious and worried
because of his eyes.

801
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:42,080
I'm really happy for you guys.

802
00:53:45,549 --> 00:53:46,949
When will Ye Jun get home?

803
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:49,960
Hee Won said I had to
play the game with him before I left.

804
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:51,989
He'll be home shortly.

805
00:53:56,629 --> 00:53:59,199
Does Hee Won still listen
to that album often?

806
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,739
Yes. Funny, right?

807
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:04,339
Even back in school,
everyone called him an old man...

808
00:54:04,339 --> 00:54:06,339
because he always listened
to old pop songs.

809
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:09,739
He used that song
to profess his feelings to me.

810
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,410
Really?

811
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,350
My, he's really something.

812
00:54:29,259 --> 00:54:31,170
- Where's Ho Joong?
- He left early.

813
00:54:31,429 --> 00:54:32,500
He said he was meeting his friends.

814
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,640
Here, let me.

815
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,299
No, thanks.

816
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,170
Just let me do it.

817
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,049
What's with you, all of a sudden?

818
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,920
Are you complaining
that I'm being nice to you?

819
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:04,330
My dad used to do this for me.

820
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,500
Are you saying I remind you of your dad?

821
00:55:07,899 --> 00:55:09,000
Before my matches,

822
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:13,370
he always tied and untied them for me.
My dad.

823
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,910
I got it for this match.

824
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,520
Well, I'll make a special exception
and let you do it this time.

825
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:26,589
From now on, don't dwell on things,
and just tell me right away.

826
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,160
Tell you what?

827
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,319
You know, those hate comments and...

828
00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:34,299
If I ever fail to notice something,
point it out right away.

829
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:36,600
You're acting weird today.

830
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,299
Why are you nice to me?

831
00:55:40,429 --> 00:55:43,069
Don't tell me
you're being nice to me out of pity...

832
00:55:43,069 --> 00:55:44,270
because I got dumped.

833
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,210
You've realized that just now?

834
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:53,449
(About, Jung Soo Yeon)

835
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,980
Hey, what's up?

836
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,649
Where?

837
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:01,319
Cheers!

838
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,230
Now, I can breathe.

839
00:56:13,899 --> 00:56:15,770
Sorry, we're drinking when you can't.

840
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,040
That's okay.

841
00:56:19,569 --> 00:56:21,779
This place always looks the same,
doesn't it?

842
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,779
But we've changed.

843
00:56:25,109 --> 00:56:27,109
The day I won
the KLPGA Championship title,

844
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:29,179
the two of us got drunk
and passed out here.

845
00:56:29,949 --> 00:56:31,890
Stop talking and drink already.

846
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,120
Gweon Suk has to go home.

847
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,859
You're looking out for your athlete.

848
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:38,560
You two share many memories together.

849
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,690
I envy you.

850
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,600
You guys can make
countless memories together from now on.

851
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,770
I envy you more.

852
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:53,640
I'm so forgetful.
I meant to ask you about this.

853
00:56:53,739 --> 00:56:55,839
For Ms. Lee, what kind of visa
are you going to apply for?

854
00:56:58,379 --> 00:57:00,350
Are you going for O-1 or P-1A?

855
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:03,120
I'm trying to figure it out
for Ms. Han at the moment.

856
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,620
My visa? What do you mean?

857
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,929
Isn't she going to the US...

858
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,830
after her title match?

859
00:57:18,929 --> 00:57:20,000
The US?

860
00:57:30,509 --> 00:57:31,580
Hey.

861
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,679
The US?

862
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,420
How much longer
were you planning on deceiving me?

863
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:42,290
I was going to tell you after this match.

864
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:44,060
You said you'd help me.

865
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:48,299
You said you'd help me quit boxing.

866
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:50,429
You told me we could run away together!

867
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:51,469
Gweon Suk.

868
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:54,839
Let's go to the US together.

869
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:57,199
We can start afresh in the US.

870
00:58:00,569 --> 00:58:01,640
Are you kidding me right now?

871
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,949
So you're telling me to keep boxing.

872
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:09,350
You think you're helping me by doing this?

873
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,790
Go to the US.
And without anyone forcing you,

874
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,520
try it just once more, of your own accord.

875
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:20,060
If that doesn't work either,
then you can quit for good.

876
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,699
You, of all people, know
how afraid I am of boxing.

877
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,770
Fear is like a hurdle.

878
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,440
It's something you must overcome
if you're an athlete.

879
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,609
I'll be by your side.

880
00:58:35,609 --> 00:58:37,210
I will help you so that
you can overcome this hurdle.

881
00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:39,810
No.

882
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,719
I'm not going to the US.

883
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:45,989
I don't need boxing in my life.

884
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,120
I was a fool for trusting you.

885
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,259
You're worse than Jae Min.

886
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,460
You're over 20 now, so grow up already.

887
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:00,670
You say you were miserable
because of boxing.

888
00:59:01,339 --> 00:59:04,399
Then were you happy
when you quit and ran away from it?

889
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,339
Tae Young.

890
00:59:09,339 --> 00:59:10,410
I bet you thought a happy life
would unfold...

891
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,879
once you ran away from boxing.

892
00:59:11,879 --> 00:59:13,049
No, you are wrong.

893
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,580
Do you think life's that easy?

894
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,649
Mr. Kim.

895
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,730
Tae Young.

896
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,029
Right now,

897
00:59:30,929 --> 00:59:32,000
on the news...

898
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,739
I repeat.

899
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:45,350
Professional baseball player
Kim Hee Won...

900
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:47,750
was found dead
at his residence in Taiwan...

901
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,149
at around 10 a.m. today, local time.

902
00:59:50,449 --> 00:59:51,719
The reporter will tell us more.

903
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,960
Where was he found?

904
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,929
He was found dead in his bedroom.

905
00:59:57,929 --> 01:00:00,759
The club manager found him...

906
01:00:00,759 --> 01:00:03,129
and reported it
to the local police in Taiwan.

907
01:00:03,129 --> 01:00:05,469
I see. I believe...

908
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:08,270
a three-page suicide note was found
at the scene.

909
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,399
However, the content of the suicide note
hasn't been revealed yet.

910
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:13,469
Right. From what I've found out,
he wrote that...

911
01:00:13,469 --> 01:00:15,879
he was involved in match fixing
back in his Cheetahs days...

912
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:19,549
and that he was ashamed of it.

913
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:20,679
I see.

914
01:00:20,779 --> 01:00:23,319
Once more details are revealed
about the suicide note,

915
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,549
the Korean professional baseball industry
will be upended.

916
01:00:25,549 --> 01:00:27,750
That's right. They say...

917
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,890
match fixing is the worst crime
athletes can commit.

918
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:32,960
Four years ago,
the Korean baseball league...

919
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,600
had a rough time due to match fixing,

920
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,299
which is why the baseball industry...

921
01:00:37,299 --> 01:00:38,429
- Tae Young.
- is closely...

922
01:00:38,429 --> 01:00:40,230
observing the situation at the moment.

01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:35,920
Pick up.

926
01:01:42,129 --> 01:01:43,830
Pick up, Hee Won.

927
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,569
Hee Won!

Hey!

932
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:11,089
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

933
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:15,000
Oh, my.

934
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,399
I'll wait for you.

935
01:02:16,759 --> 01:02:18,299
You're confident
that you'll get picked, right?

936
01:02:18,629 --> 01:02:19,730
Yes, of course.

937
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,339
When you go to the Major League,
I'll be right next to you.

938
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:24,910
Just wait and see.

939
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,649
Pick up.

940
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,660
Pick up your phone.

941
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:09,350

942
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,219

(Next episode)

945
01:03:57,929 --> 01:03:59,469
In Hee Won's suicide note,

946
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,540
your name wasn't mentioned.

947
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:02,540
Why not?

948
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:05,040
He didn't want you to get suspected.
Not even for a second.

949
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:06,870
I can't breathe.

950
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:09,239
It's okay to cry in front of me, mister.

951
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:10,440
I'm all ears.

952
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,410
Maybe, I wasn't supposed to see that.

953
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:15,319
Kim, are you living with Lee Gweon Suk?

954
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,520
There's Lee Gweon Suk!

955
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,580
Don't come near me.

956
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:19,319
You'll get hurt.

957
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:20,489
If I tell your granddaughter...

958
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,890
that you got fired for fixing matches...

959
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:25,230
and that you're responsible
for a man's death,

960
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:28,029
I'm very curious about what she'll say.

961
01:04:28,029 --> 01:04:29,929
Where are these jerks?

962
01:04:30,129 --> 01:04:32,129
I guess you adore Lee Gweon Suk.

963
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:37,339
I do adore her.

964
01:04:41,509 --> 01:04:42,509
Mister?
