1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:02,410
Get up! Come at me!

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,110
Get lost!

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,050
- Move aside!
- Dad!

5
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,030
Sleep some more.

6
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,030
It's okay to sleep more.

7
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,810
I'm Lee Yu Ri.

8
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:18,519
Except for my habit
of waking up before dawn,

9
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,719
I was perfectly Lee Yu Ri.

10
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,640
A peaceful world...

11
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,349
where I had no expectations
or hardships I couldn't handle.

(Kim Tae Young, Sports and Passion)

13
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,390
I wanted to meet you, Ms. Lee Kwon Sook.

14
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,930
This man crushed my world.

15
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,199
My gosh. I looked everywhere for you.

16
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:15,469
It's so good to see you
standing right before me.

17
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,210
I don't know who you are,

18
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,449
but you've got the wrong person.

19
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,750
I guess you still box.

20
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,860
You still run every morning.

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,129
Don't tell me
you've been following me in secret.

22
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,259
What are you looking at?

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,460
I'll report you to the police.

24
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,830
It's been a long time
since you disappeared,

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,770
but I see that you're still in shape.

26
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,539
Who are you?

27
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:47,539
Are you a reporter?

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,520
(Sports and Passion, Kim Tae Young)

29
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,719
What's your offer, mister?

30
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,789
Will it be 200,000 dollars?
Or 300,000? A million?

31
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,990
You have no money.

32
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,129
Stop following me around.

33
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,169
I will never go back to the ring.

34
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:21,509
Wait.

35
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,789
Next time, I won't stop.

36
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,189
You've been warned.

37
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:47,629
You see,

38
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm not trying to do anything here.

39
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,099
I'm here to help you.

40
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,139
Help me?

41
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,509
People at the association
are looking for you.

42
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,710
So?

43
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,509
From reporters to agents,

44
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,949
everyone will swarm here and bother you.

45
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,389
If it gets too much, call me.

46
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,349
I'll help you.

47
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
(Sports and Passion, Kim Tae Young)

48
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,230
Take it.

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,170
Take it for now. If you deem it useless,
you can then chuck it.

50
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,379
But why would you help me, mister?

51
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,649
Because Lee Kwon Sook is the best boxer,

52
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,810
and I want to work
with the best of the best.

53
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,949
Don't waste your time talking
to everyone who comes here.

54
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,850
Only talk to me.

55
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,660
Because I'm the best.

56
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,660
I'm sorry,

57
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,160
but I'm not Lee Kwon Sook.

58
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,329
I'm Lee Yu Ri.

59
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,860
I moved six times.

60
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,860
I don't want to move anymore.

61
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,629
What a bother he is.

62

(Central Electronics)

63
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,930
Welcome.

64
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,870
Gosh, you're here early.

65
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,430
There was no traffic jam?

66
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,939
Dad, can you prepare
one more serving of today's special?

67
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,439
Sure.

68
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,649
Why are you still standing there?
Come and sit down.

69
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,720
This is the best restaurant
you will find in Seoul.

70
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,089
Right, Dad?

71
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:58,860
You're the only one who thinks that.

72
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,660
Sit down.

73
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:06,529
Where's Chairman Nam?

74
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,839
Goodness. You know, he's such a busy bee.

75
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,839
So I came alone.

76
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,540
I checked out the plan you sent over.

77
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:19,180
I was quite surprised to see a name
I didn't see coming at all.

78
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,279
So Lee Kwon Sook?

79
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,250
She's a boxer
who was active up until three years ago.

80
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:29,689
Gosh, you said
you weren't interested in our business.

81
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,189
I was indeed impressed by your choice.
You know?

82
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,829
Here's a thing about match fixing.

83
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,129
Soccer and baseball
draw too much attention.

84
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:42,230
So sports that are out of the public eye
like boxing are perfect for this.

85
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,939
Could you give me a detailed plan
of what you have in mind?

86
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,709
- Here's some water.
- Okay, Dad.

87
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,310
You can talk freely here.

88
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,449
He's one of Chairman Nam's regulars.

89
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:00,649
First off,

90
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,550
I'm going to get her to come back
to the ring as soon as possible.

91
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,730
Two, please.

92
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:14,329
She will play only two matches.

93
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,199
She will win her comeback match.

94
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,069
But she will lose
the world championship title match.

95
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,240
("Exclusive: The Return of a Genius,
Genius Boxer Lee Kwon Sook in Hiding")

96
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,480
There aren't a lot of
female professional boxers.

97
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,319
She'll be able to participate in
a title match only after two games.

98
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,480
Only two matches? Are you serious?

99
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,850
Think about all the effort
you made to find her.

100
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,120
We won't be able
to make any profit off this.

101
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,789
Then we can raise the stakes.

102
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,659
I get that
Lee Kwon Sook is a famous boxer.

103
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,289
But it won't be easy to do that.

104
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,799
You know that
boxing isn't a popular sport.

105
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,029
This isn't the US.

106
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,169
You know that
she once ran away from the ring.

107
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:50,940
If the hurdle is too high,
she won't even want to negotiate.

108
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,000
So is she interested
in negotiating a deal?

109
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,470
I'll make it so that signing the deal
is the only option she has.

110
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,809
So it's not because she wants more money?

111
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:59,740
I think I can sign her
without offering the full amount.

112
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,279
(Title Match)

113
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,950
Do we need her to play two matches?

114
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,649
She can't lose the first one
as soon as she comes back.

115
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,090
Why would people bet big money
on a boxer...

116
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,990
who might not even win?

117
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,429
Well, the chairman...

118
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,399
isn't the patient type.

119
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,029
Are you sure
you can do this in three months?

120
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,100
Three months...

121
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
will be enough time.

122
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,740
Let me be honest with you.

123
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,809
Something about this makes me nervous.

124
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,009
The victory in her comeback match
will get people hyped up.

125
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,679
And your plan is to rake in money
with the next match.

126
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,379
It's obviously a plan,
concocted by a novice.

127
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:42,120
Besides, the boxer will have to take
on a lot of risk for this.

128
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,919
Let's begin.

129
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,990
<i>Pinocchio the marionette</i>

130
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,960
<i>- I like you</i>
<i>- I like you</i>

131
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,029
- One.
- One.

132
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,730
- Two.
- Two.

133
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,730
Go.

134
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,340
If we rig a big game like this
from the beginning,

135
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,669
she won't have a future as an athlete.

136
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,639
Are you sure about this?

137
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,779
- Lee Kwon Sook is still pretty young.
- One, two!

138
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,850
So what?

139
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,250
What's your point?

140
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,889
I'm saying this out of caution.

141
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,029
She's different from Kim Hee Won,
a player whose retirement was nearing.

142
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,929
To end her career like this,

143
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:26,730
don't you think she's too young
and we're wasting her talent?

144
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,470
That girl...

145
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,700
She might never be able to box again.

146
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,110
She's already quit once.

147
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,440
Isn't she perfect to use and then discard?

148
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,009
How cold-hearted.

149
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,350
Do you have a problem with my plan?

150
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,950
If you're that worried about her,

151
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,120
why don't we stop here?

152
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:50,789
No.

153
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,889
You do live up to your reputation.

154
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,659
You're a true businessman.

155
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,870
- Can you make space in the middle?
- Sure.

156
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,500
Okay. It's hot.

157
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Here.

158
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,340
Actually,

159
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,779
the tastiest thing we serve is water.

160
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:19,720
Since it's your first time here,
I'll give you one more bowl of rice.

161
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,120
Gosh. You didn't give me any extra rice.

162
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,450
Come on.

163
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,960
Then enjoy your meal.

164
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,929
Wait. Where are you going?

165
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,230
Eat before you go.

166
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,200
You'll upset them.

167
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:33,929
Eat up.

168
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,740
Gosh. Thanks for the food.

169
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,679
How is it?

170
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,980
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

171
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,980
Cheers.

172
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,129
Hold on a minute.
You haven't told us any good news, Yu Ri.

173
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,759
How did the blind date go?

174
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,529
- What?
- You just flinched.

175
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:07,799
You must have gotten dumped again.

176
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,529
No, my friend was a jerk.

177
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,370
It turned out he had a girlfriend.

178
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,570
- Gosh.
- I ended up wasting your time. I'm sorry.

179
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,740
You don't have to apologize.

180
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:19,779
Do you want to go on another date?
I know a great guy.

181
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:21,580
He works at a gaming company.

182
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,879
And he owns the house he lives in.

183
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,590
Ms. Yu Ri!

184
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,860
Do you want to date my uncle?

185
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,960
He's really handsome.

186
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,059
His nickname is Cha Eun Woo!

187
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:38,399
Hey, your uncle looks just like you.

188
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,100
Then he must be handsome.

189
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,799
I don't want to go on blind dates.
So stop trying to fix me up.

190
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,570
All right, kids.

191
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,840
You're done with your food.
Let's go and brush your teeth.

192
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,279
Let's go. Come here.

193
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,909
Does she have a crush on someone?

194
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,120
Who?

195
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Who knows?

196
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,549
The sky is the limit
as long as her crush isn't that dreamboat.

(Superwoman, Assistant Teacher Lee Yu Ri)

201
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,190
I'm not some superhero.

202
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,830
- Yu Ri.
- Yu Ri.

203
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,059
Yes?

204
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,769
You like Mr. Han, right?

205
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,370
What?

206
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,669
Me? No. That's not true.

207
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,840
Of course, you do. I saw your googly eyes.

208
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,340
You've been staring at his picture.

209
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,480
I thought
you were going to make a hole there.

210
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,450
Oh, that? His name tag was crooked.

211
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,649
So I was just fixing that.

212
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:40,549
That's all.

213
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,120
He's 30 years old, but he still
hasn't gotten his act together.

214
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,759
He's mooching off his mother.

215
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,690
He looks down on us
because he's the son of the director.

216
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,830
We shouldn't be fooled by good looks.
That's the last thing we should do. Okay?

217
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Let's get back to work.

218
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,769
I know that too.

219
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,610
(Assistant Director Han Jae Min)

220
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:13,919
My goodness.

221
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,450
Why does he keep his desk here?
It takes up so much space.

222
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,059
Yu Ri, don't clean it for him.
Let him do it.

223
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,059
Be nice.

224
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,700
He comes to work
three times a week at most.

225
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:29,200
He goes camping in the spring,

226
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,100
surfing in the summer,
snowboarding in the winter,

227
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:35,169
and riding his motorbike all year round.

00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:36,210
(hjm_win00)

229
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,779
I wondered what I could do, as an adult,

230
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:41,779
to ensure the children could always smile,

231
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,350
and I decided to give them...

232
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,419
a yard for them to run around in
and look up at the sky.

233
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:48,250
They can run freely,

234
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:49,990
draw on the ground,

235
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,590
and grow produce in the fields.

236
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,019
He's such a talker.

237
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,230
He looks pretty too.

238
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,090
He gets paid regularly.

239
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,700
He should be good at something.

240
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,629
How much is that outfit?

241
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:02,799
It's his mom's money.

242
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,169
Emotional growth is...

243
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:08,809
He's nothing without
his smooth talk and pretty looks.

244
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,580
He does nothing for his pay
and uses his mom's credit card.

245
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,649
And still, my heart races
when he's around.

246
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,690
- Yu Ri.
- Yes?

247
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,419
There's ash on your cheek.

248
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,429
- Ash?
- Yes.

249
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,500
Oh, right.

250
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,230
- This side.
- Okay.

251
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:39,000
It's smudged.

252
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,950
There you go.

253
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,190
My gosh.

254
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:05,529
That scared me.

255
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,269
I jumped.

256
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,170
Oh, let me.

257
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,069
No, I'll do it.

258
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,910
He's the first man...

259
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,180
who didn't punch me,

260
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,250
Doesn't it look good?

261
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,009
shout in anger, but wiped my face...

262
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,019
with his bare hand.

263
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,799
What are you looking at?

264
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,440
What if we planted flowers over there?

265
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,869
I think the kids would like it.

266
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,670
Flowers? What kind?

267
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,210
We could plant so many kinds.

268
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,920
Marigold. Shasta daisies are pretty too.

269
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,119
Garden nasturtiums are pretty.

270
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,390
So are garden zinnias.

271
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,119
Pansies are cute with their short stems.

272
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:06,920
It has a nice message.

273
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,430
"Please love me."

274
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:16,170
You must like flowers.

275
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:19,339
Yes. A lot.

276
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,309
My mom liked them.

277
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,640
You must be a lot like her.

278
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,210
She must've been pretty too.

279
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,150
Yes.

280
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,619
Flower names are quite hard to remember.

281
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,890
Marigold.

282
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,119
It means...

283
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,890
Look.

284
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,630
"Happiness that is bound to come."

285
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,299
I like what marigolds mean. Don't you?

286
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,470
Yes.

287
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,910
If we were to plant some,
the parents would like it.

288
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,910
Thanks, Yu Ri.

289
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,430
Table eight, drinks one and seven.

290
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,130
Table eight, drinks one and seven.

291
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,430
- Table three?
- Yes.

292
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,539
Ah Reum, can I have a word?

293
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,839
Yes. Table three, your order's coming.

294
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:34,339
- Here you go.
- What would you recommend?

295
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,079
I think the Belgian...

296
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,480
- You're off soon, right?
- Yes.

297
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,789
So am I. What do you do later?

298
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,089
Why do you want to know?

299
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,589
I just want to.

300
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,529
- Mr. Manager.
- Yes?

301
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,930
Do you want to do something with me?

302
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,240
You're outspoken and direct.

303
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,539
Well, there's no need to waste time.

304
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:05,339
I don't mind hanging out,
but it won't be fun.

305
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,980
You don't mind hanging out?

306
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,049
I don't.

307
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,119
But anything physical like kissing's a no.

308
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,089
Who'd do that on the first date?

309
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,250
I'm not that kind of guy.

310
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,859
Can we do what I want to do?

311
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,990
What?

312
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,529
Yes. Let's do what you want.

313
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,759
Okay, then.

314
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,269
Jab...

315
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:33,900
Jab...

316
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,109
One, two, three, four.

317
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,779
Forward and backward.

318
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,809
Okay, now punch.

319
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,180
Come on. One, two.

320
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,509
Guards up.

321
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,720
Guard.

322
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,420
Do it properly.

323
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,119
Hey, face me.

324
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,460
Come on.

325
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,490
Hit this.

326
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:57,589
Ah Reum has a weird hobby, doesn't she?

327
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:01,630
She got rid of about 20 guys this way.

328
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,869
No, exactly 28.

329
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:07,000
This guy paid for three months in advance.

330
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,039
A single payment too.

331
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,609
And go. One...

332
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:12,079
I didn't force him to.

333
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,609
He wanted to appeal to Ah Reum.
Why would I stop him?

334
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,950
- You shouldn't.
- Pace lightly and go.

335
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,119
Guard up.

336
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,460
One, two, three, four.

337
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,819
Keep it tight.

338
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,589
When can I send out the article?

339
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,900
Give me a rough date at least.

340
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,329
Because of you,

341
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,400
I postponed the show
to write this up first.

342
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,670
Wait just one week.

343
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:40,569
That long?

344
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:43,740
What if word gets out
and someone else writes about it?

345
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,809
Who else would catch wind?

346
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:47,980
You'll get your exclusive.

347
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,319
Hey, I have to hang up.

348
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,849
- Okay.
- Let's talk again tomorrow.

349
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:57,150
Mr. Kim, long time no see.

350
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,859
(Battery)

351
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,000
First floor.

352
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,049
What are you doing?

353
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,109
Hey, you're back.

354
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,390
She won't wake up.

355
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:34,220
Shall I get her a cab?

356
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,460
You can't send her off
when she's this drunk.

357
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:40,430
Ms. Jung, wake up.

358
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:42,299
Soo Yeon.

359
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,700
Will you leave me alone?

360
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,210
It's Tae Young.

361
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,410
Tae Young, I'm here to see you.

362
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,750
Why did you drink so much?

363
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,920
Let's get you up on your feet.

364
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,319
No, get a grip and stand up.

365
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,920
Why are you so frigid?

366
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:10,730
It's me, Jung Soo Yeon.

367
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,759
The golfing empress.

368
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,599
- Hey.
- What?

369
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,900
If you want a promotion,

370
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,470
complete fair and square and perform well.

371
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,509
- Yes, that's right.
- What's right?

372
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:26,609
Do you think you can beat me?

373
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:27,980
- Let go.
- No.

374
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,420
Gosh. She still buys fruit
whenever she visits.

375
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,490
You guys broke up ages ago.

376
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,730
Peeling mandarins...

377
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,369
brings back memories.

378
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,339
You know what Soo Yeon used to say.

379
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,410
Fruit stores reminded her...

380
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,140
of your mom,
so she just had to buy something.

381
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,710
That was long ago.

382
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:07,450
If she were to know
she got drunk and visited her ex...

383
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,650
She'd want to hit herself.

384
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,319
I wonder how she'll manage tomorrow.

385
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,190
Wake her up in the morning
and send her to work.

386
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:17,059
What?

387
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,259
You're going to bed already?

388
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:22,269
I haven't visited in a while.

389
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,869
Don't you know the term "miracle morning?"

390
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,970
It's the secret to my success.

391
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:32,140
You can't sleep in because you're old.

392
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,980
Darn him.

393
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,309
Ms. Lee!

394
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:06,680
You lied when you said
you didn't want to return.

395
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,710
Be honest.
You want to box again, don't you?

396
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:11,980
So you're trying to stay in shape.

397
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:15,920
I'm not running because I want to.

398
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,160
- Go away.
- Why run if you don't want to?

399
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:20,319
It makes no sense.

400
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,559
It hurts when I don't run.
That's why I do it.

401
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,630
It hurts when you don't run?

402
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:25,000
Is there a disease like that?

403
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,559
It's just the way my body is.

404
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:29,529
My dad put the curse on me.

405
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,470
I must say, you're so nice.

406
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,539
You're answering every question I ask.

407
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,210
Leave me alone.

408
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,150
Shall I call the cops on you?

409
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:45,519
It must've been hard.

410
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:47,779
I get it.

411
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,450
I was a baseball player in high school,

412
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,690
so I know how hard it is.

413
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,890
Gosh, it really is awful.

414
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,730
In winter, you have to
freeze your buttocks off. And in summer...

415
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,059
It's so hot that you can't breathe.

416
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,049
What?

417
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,119
Hello.

418
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,549
- Hi.
- Hi, you're here.

419
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:23,549
Yes!

420
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,960
Oh, boy.

421
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:29,589
Have you eaten?

422
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:30,960
I just had some milk.

423
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,259
Good girl.

424
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,130
Good. Never leave the house
on an empty stomach.

425
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,299
Take this.

426
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:39,069
Yes.

427
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,500
Thank you.

428
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,369
- Gosh, how adorable.
- I'll be off, then.

429
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,710
All right. Keep it up.

430
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,710
Okay!

431
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,450
Do you like candy?

432
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:55,519
Oh, no. Then it'll be hard for you
to watch what you eat.

433
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:58,859
You put on such an angelic smile
in front of that lady earlier.

434
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,690
How much will you get paid
if you persuade me to return to the ring?

435
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,630
Will you get 10,000 dollars?

436
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Or 20,000 dollars?

437
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:08,029
Come on. Why are you asking me this?

438
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,799
I'll give you the money.

439
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,009
I have money.

440
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:18,880
I get pension benefits
thanks to my medals.

441
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,279
I received prize money
from the association too,

442
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,009
and I've saved some of the money I earned
from my part-time jobs.

443
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,279
How much do you want?

444
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,650
How much do you think I'd want?

445
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,589
Don't smirk like that.
I'm dead serious right now.

446
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,819
I will never go back to the ring,
no matter what.

447
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,160
And I don't want to move again.

448
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,789
I'd hate to look for a new job,

449
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,289
and I cannot change my name again.

450
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:40,299
- So how much?
- I'm expensive.

451
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:41,430
How much?

452
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,829
Two and a half million.

453
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,309
Oh, no. You don't have that kind of money?

454
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:51,670
I got excited for no reason.

455
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:54,640
Then you have no choice.

456
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,079
Let's run together like this
every morning...

457
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,480
until you change your mind.

458
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:02,920
It's like a trend these days.
You know, a running crew.

459
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:05,390
Thanks to you, I get to exercise.

460
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,990
And you won't be lonely.

461
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,089
I said I would never return to the ring.

462
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:12,859
Over my dead body!
My mom died because of boxing.

463
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,400
Do not follow me.

464
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,170
If you follow me, you're dead meat.

465
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,319
Yes.

466
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,859
Ms. Lee, did you receive the first draft
of Lee Kwon Sook's contract?

467
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,359
Tae Young said he sent it just now.

468
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,529
Hold on. Let me check.

469
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,730
Yes. A hospital?

470
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,829
Sure, I'll look into it
and let you know right away.

471
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:51,500
A hospital? Someone's hurt again?

472
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:55,440
No. He said to find the hospital
where Lee Kwon Sook's mother was.

473
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,609
Lee Kwon Sook's mother?

474
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,609
Yes.

475
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,250
Lee Kwon Sook?
The Lee Kwon Sook we all know?

476
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:08,349
Hey.

477
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,490
Why did you come to my office
so early in the morning?

478
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,519
You're not welcome here. Also...

479
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:15,559
why didn't you knock?

480
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,630
I heard you were looking
for Jang Jae Hee's batting gloves.

481
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,400
My gosh. You found them?

482
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,430
I couldn't find any in Korea.

483
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,099
I have a habit
of buying these things in bulk.

484
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,569
Oh, my. I should call Jang.

485
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,009
If you need more, just let me know.

486
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:33,240
Will do. Thank you.

487
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:40,779
Did you not go home last night?

488
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,750
Goodness. You reek of alcohol.

489
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,390
So I guess Kim is...

490
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,230
helping Lee Kwon Sook
prepare for her comeback.

491
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,960
Gosh, you smell like booze.

492
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,230
Why do you need to know that?
It's none of your business.

493
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,740
Stop making my office smell like booze.

494
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:00,269
Get out at once.

495
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,210
- Get out. Now!
- Am I right?

496
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,470
Gosh, you stink.

497
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:07,339
Go. Get out! Did you have soju last night?
Hurry up and go.

498
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:08,579
My goodness.

499
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:13,549
How much did she drink last night?
I feel like I'm tipsy now.

500
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:14,849
Gosh, I feel dizzy.

501
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:20,589
Ms. Lee!

502
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,730
Stopping suddenly like this
only makes it harder.

503
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,700
It makes your temperature drop.
What if you catch a cold?

504
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,599
Why are you so late?

505
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,769
Good morning!

506
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:45,109
All right. Today,

507
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,079
let's do some weaving while running.

508
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,119
All right! Like this.

509
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:00,599
Are you trying to wave away mosquitoes?

510
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:04,200
Gosh, you know nothing about boxing.

511
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,170
You know nothing about me.

512
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,240
I used to manage a boxer.

513
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,369
Estomata of Korea.

514
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,240
Then go to him.

515
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:12,640
Stop bugging me.

516
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,349
Lee Kwon Sook is right before my eyes.

517
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:21,049
Why would I go to someone else?

518
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,390
I will persuade Lee Kwon Sook
to go back to the ring!

519
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,720
Hey, good morning!

520
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,430
Hi!

521
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,279
Hey!

522
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,619
What are you waiting for? Start running.

523
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,220
Were you waiting for me?

524
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:05,259
Nice. One, two, one, two.

525
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,329
The left foot!

526
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:08,930
Try weaving a little too.

527
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,400
And throw some jabs!

528
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,730
Shoot.

529
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,410
(Safety Guidelines for Step-Stone Bridge)

530
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,380
Did you have breakfast?

531
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,079
- Yes.
- Yes, we did.

532
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,279
Take this.

533
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,319
Thank you.

534
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,430
That lollipop. Do you get one every day?

535
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:39,160
You don't eat it, do you?

536
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,329
I must eat sweets after I run.

537
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,440
If I don't, I might pass out.

538
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:46,970
I'm addicted to sugar.

539
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,740
Come on.
I think you're just eating it to show me.

540
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,339
I must say, you look like
you do need to lose some weight.

541
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,880
How dare you scan me up and down?

542
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:59,579
You're 4kg overweight
for your weight class, right?

543
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:02,190
No, I'm 40kg overweight.

544
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,589
What do you say? Do you want to experience
a heavyweight boxer's punch?

545
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:18,970
One iced Americano, please.

546
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:20,269
I'll pay with this card.

547
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,470
Put it on this card.

548
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,579
And one more iced Americano
with an extra shot.

549
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,980
What's with you today? You're scaring me.

550
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,380
I heard you found Lee Kwon Sook.

551
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,819
What? Come on. Who said that?

552
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,819
The show hasn't even hit the air yet.

553
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,460
Don't be like this.

554
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,359
I know you teamed up with Kim Tae Young
and tracked her down.

555
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,759
Where is she?

556
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:46,630
Let's exchange some valuable intel.

557
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:49,230
Come on. I can't tell you.

558
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,269
I can't betray my partner's trust.

559
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,700
The most prominent free agent
of the year, Yang Jae Ho.

560
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,369
I'll give you an exclusive scoop.

561
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,470
Now, what do you say?

562
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:04,309
Deal.

563
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,950
Deal.

564
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,260
What's going on this morning?

565
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,829
He's going to plant flowers over there.

566
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:21,230
I'm talking about the assistant director
who comes to work three days a week.

567
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,230
Flowers?

568
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,599
We didn't even finish farming the field
in the back.

569
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,800
He's not expecting us to water them,
right?

570
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,579
What? Aren't those boxes of flowers?

571
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,650
Of course, they are.

572
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,349
The assistant director
is blowing money again. Gosh.

573
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:44,250
But flowers are pretty at least.

574
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,789
And kids will like them too.

575
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Let's go inside.

576
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,380
It smells like my mom.

577
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,090
You must be a lot like her.

578
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,760
She must've been pretty too.

579
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,230
"Happiness that is bound to come."

580
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,460
I like what marigolds mean. Don't you?

581
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,530
A secret between the assistant director
and me has bloomed here.

582
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,289
Great.

583
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,230
Come on. How big of a legend
are you trying to be now?

584
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,329
I may not be the starting pitcher,

585
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:05,769
but the least I can do
is not let my team down.

586
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,570
I have a job thanks to them.

587
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:12,309
Gosh. Come on. Don't be like that.

588
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:13,679
You're a legend. Don't downplay it.

589
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,059
Gosh.

590
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,000
Just the two of us being here...

591
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,039
brings back old memories.

592
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:45,139
You struck out a lot of players
on that field right there.

593
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:47,079
And the team won the Korean Series
back to back.

594
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,980
It was great, wasn't it?

595
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,280
I'm sorry.

596
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,519
You went to that jerk...

597
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:58,050
and told him
you would take responsibility for it.

598
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,860
I went to Reporter Park a few days ago.

599
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,960
I was going to tell him everything I did.

600
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:09,630
But what?

601
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:12,500
But I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

602
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,809
Why did you go see him
if you couldn't even go through with it?

603
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:22,809
Are you trying to ruin your life for good?

604
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:24,309
I went to him because I was frustrated.

605
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,119
When I came back to my senses,
I couldn't believe what I had done.

606
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,219
I'm ashamed to face my son.
And I put you in a tight spot too.

607
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,519
I thought going to prison
after coming clean...

608
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,460
would make me feel at ease.

609
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,590
If you go to prison,

610
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,400
what will happen to Ye Jun?
What about his eyes?

611
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,960
You'll let him go blind?

612
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,710
Hee Won, just lie low.

613
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:57,980
Don't get involved and make a mess...

614
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,579
unless you're trying to ruin your life.

615
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:02,289
I'm going to clean this up.

616
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,820
If you're truly sorry,

617
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:10,190
finish the season without injury...

618
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:12,659
and retire
when your team still respects you.

619
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,300
And think about
how you'll retire in style.

620
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:17,130
Got it?

621
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,960
Where are you?

622
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,599
Hey, there will be a traffic jam
in Gangnam around this time of the day.

623
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,440
Okay.

624
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,969
Even if I'm late,
be a good girl and wait for me there.

625
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,309
Okay. Me too.

626
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,420
Are you going to water them?

627
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,719
Yes. Are you getting off work?

628
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,719
Why are you doing it?

629
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,360
We can get the workers to do it.

630
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,230
I just wanted to water them.

631
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,289
But that must be heavy.

632
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,530
Look. Your clothes got wet.

633
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:26,440
What is it?

634
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,409
Then why don't you carry it for me?

635
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,210
What? Me?

636
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,010
Gosh, I can't.

637
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,349
Then you should just go.

638
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,349
Give it to me. I'll do it.

639
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,760
Let me. Gosh. What is this?

640
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,059
Why is this so heavy?

641
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:54,000
Did I just get some muscles?

642
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,300
All of a sudden?

643
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,469
I had to carry the bucket many times.

644
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,869
I don't want a muscle imbalance.

645
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,340
How are you getting home?

646
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,610
I'm taking the local bus.

647
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,210
If it's on the way, I can drive you.

648
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,250
Which neighborhood is it?

649
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:16,119
You have someone waiting for you.

650
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,360
A good girl who will wait
even if you're late.

651
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,420
Right.

652
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,059
You pointed that out without a heads-up.

653
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,130
Fine. Then let's take a rain check.

654
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:31,969
I'll drive you
when no one's waiting for me.

655
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,340
You don't mind, right?

656
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:38,739
I'll think about that when the time comes.

657
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:45,949
Yu Ri!

658
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,989
Gosh.

659
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,019
I'm sorry. I should have called ahead.

660
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,260
I was in the neighborhood.

661
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,389
And I really missed you.

662
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,699
I see. Is he your colleague?

663
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:04,570
Yes, sort of.

664
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:07,539
- Who is he?
- Oh, me?

665
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:10,239
I went on a blind date with her
a while ago.

666
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,510
And we've been exercising together
every morning lately.

667
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,579
A morning exercise?

668
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,550
Mr. Han, I'll get going first.

669
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:20,519
Drive safely.

670
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:23,449
Let's go. Hurry up.

671
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,590
See you around.

672
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,869
Are you trying to ruin my life?

673
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,579
A blind date?

674
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,179
You missed me?

675
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,610
Ridiculous.

676
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:57,690
I see. You like the assistant director.

677
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,860
No wonder you came here
without complaining.

678
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:03,429
What? Seriously.

679
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:06,400
You're going to want to thank me.
But don't.

680
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,500
Men get more anxious
when they see competition.

681
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,699
What are we doing here?

682
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,199
What's this?

683
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:20,079
Read it and give me some feedback.

684
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,079
I'll manage 2 games in the next 3 months
after you come back to the ring.

685
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,219
The sponsorship deals for the matches,
commercials, product planning, and so on.

686
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:29,150
You will get the best treatment
in the industry.

687
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:32,050
How many times must I say this?

688
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:34,090
I'm done with boxing.

689
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,320
Go anywhere in the world.

690
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,630
But you won't be able to find
a deal better than this.

691
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:41,099
If you want to add more conditions,
let me know.

692
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:42,630
Do you not understand me?

693
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,969
I'm done with boxing.

694
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,670
Why not?

695
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:50,909
Because of your mother?

696
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,739
Stop using your mother as an excuse.

697
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,980
You're 23. You're not that young anymore.

698
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,110
Are you done?

699
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,150
I went to the nursing home
where your mother was admitted.

700
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:04,289
I was told that she had a chronic disease.

701
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:06,260
And she passed away peacefully...

702
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,019
in the presence of her family.

703
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,829
You're using her as an excuse
because you don't want to box.

704
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:16,170
Aren't you ashamed
to face your late mother?

705
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:19,940
What do you know about my mother?

706
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,150
The day you promised came and went.

707
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,920
What about the Lee Kwon Sook article?

708
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,860
(Kim Tae Young)

709
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,730
(What about the Lee Kwon Sook article?)

710
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,360
Send the Lee Kwon Sook article.

711
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,500
Eleven hours until the press release.

712
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,000
Okay.

713
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,110
(They're cautiously working out details.)

(Lee Kwon Sook, The Boxer Who Vanished)

716
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:45,250
What? A reporter from where?

717
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,019
There's no teacher here with that name.

718
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,530
- Hodong Kindergarten.
- You can't keep calling us.

719
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,300
None of our teachers are into boxing.

720
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,130
- Hodong Kindergarten.
- You got the wrong number.

721
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,400
Goodbye.

722
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,130
- Sorry.
- Can you not call us?

723
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,900
- None of the teachers boxes.
- How many times must I say so?

724
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,840
Hodong Kindergarten.

725
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,139
Yes, goodbye.

726
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:06,139
No, sorry.

727
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:07,179
Attention, everyone.

728
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:10,210
Don't answer
any of the reporters' questions,

729
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,550
and call the parents
of all your students in person.

730
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,550
Okay?

731
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,219
- Yes.
- Yes.

732
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,460
What's up with him?
He's not the guy I knew.

733
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,559
I know.

734
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:25,630
Yu Ri was Lee Kwon Sook.

735
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,960
That's why she was so strong.

736
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,699
- What's going on?
- What's the time?

737
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,510
- Hey.
- The school bus is here!

738
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,880
- Let's go.
- Wait!

739
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:56,889
Can you open the door? Let us in.

740
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,780
- I'm scared.
- It's okay, kids. It's nothing.

741
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,210
Ms. Yu Ri.

742
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,309
Who is Lee Kwon Sook?

743
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,480
Can we not go to class?

744
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:21,949
What are the grown-ups doing?

745
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:26,119
It's okay. Nothing's wrong.

746
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:29,420
What should we do? They're scared.

747
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,800
I'll get out first so you can drive in.

748
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,039
Are you sure about that?
What if you get hurt?

749
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:41,769
- I'll open the door.
- Come outside!

750
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:46,239
- She got up.
- Open the door!

751
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:48,010
Wait. Open the door!

752
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:52,449
You read the article, didn't you?

753
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:54,619
Is it true you signed
with S and P to return?

754
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:56,349
Why were you hiding here?

755
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:58,420
Do you know who you're up against?

756
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,019
Is anything decided yet?

757
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:01,989
Will you take on Han Ah Reum?

758
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,059
It's okay.

759
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:11,969
Be quiet. The kids are crying!

760
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,840
Get out of the way.

761
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,340
Get out of the way.

762
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,579
Get out of the way.

765
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:48,269
Should we show Ah Reum or not?

766
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:51,739
Won't she have seen it?

767
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,440
Shall I comfort her?

768
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,010
Or curse with her?

769
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,710
Curse with her if she curses,

770
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,280
and if she goes too far, comfort her.

771

What's that?

772
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,250
Cater to how she feels.

773
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:05,719
Okay.

774
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:07,619
Is Young Sik...

775

Coach.

Can you find me a guy
to spar with next time?

781

Okay, why not?

Will you set her up with my brother?

784
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:34,820
Ah Reum, can you beat him to a pulp?

785
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:39,250
Which part, exactly?

786
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,690
Name any part of the body.

787
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,349
Ah Reum.

788
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,289
Ah Reum!

789
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:14,860
(3 years ago)

790
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,960
Hey.

791

You've been in there for days.

792
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,000
Will you leave me alone?

793

Your mother came to me in tears.

794

You need to eat to live.

795
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,900
You must live to get your belt back.

796
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:32,869
Are you sulking
because you lost a stupid belt?

797
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:34,380
"A stupid belt?"

798
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,449
It was the WBC belt!

799
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:39,880
I lost two molars trying to win that!

800
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,179
What about you?

801
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:42,679
You took out loans...

802
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,550
just to pay for the match.

803
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:45,849
So what?

804
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:47,760
Where's your pride?

805
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,090
You used to be a world champion!

806
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:52,630
Why lock yourself up and cry...

807
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,599
over a kid who fled from a match?

808
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,840
I wasn't crying over her.

809
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:05,369
I felt bad about what you went through.

810
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,940
What?

811
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,110
Why would you feel bad for me?

812
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,050
We can start over.

813
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,380
Let's get the belt back.

814
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:17,190
It'll take just a year.

815
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,219
What if we can't?

816
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:23,329
What do you think talent is?

817
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:25,059
It's not giving up.

818
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:26,900
And you...

819
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,630
You have that.

820
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,130
We can try again.

821
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:31,670
We can get it back.

822
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:19,150
What did the director say?

823
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,179
Until things calm down,

824
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,190
I should take time off.

825
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,159
I apologize.

826
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,929
I disrupted everyone's class.

827
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:32,489
You don't have to apologize to me.

828
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,630
I think the teachers
and kids were shocked.

829
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,630
Some kids even had fits during class.

830
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:39,670
I apologize.

831
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,539
It's not your fault.

832
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,610
All the people who came here are at fault.

833
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:47,539
Don't be too upset.

834
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,110
If you must take a break,
you might as well enjoy it.

835
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,280
Don't worry about us here.

836
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:53,820
Okay.

837
00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:55,349
Take your time.

838
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,619
Step up carefully. Watch your step
and the person in front of you.

839
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,860
That's it. Climb up carefully.

840
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,929
Carefully and slowly.

841
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:07,860
Yu Ri.

842
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:10,130
I'll go on my own today.

843
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,400
I have to explain to the parents...

844
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,940
and apologize for what happened.

845
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,469
It would be much easier
if you weren't there.

846
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,980
Okay. I'm sorry.

847
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,539
It was a long, crazy day.

848
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,050
Why didn't you even tell me?

849
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:27,579
See you.

850
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,190
(Hodong Kindergarten)

851
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:33,989
Wear your seat belts.

852
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,949
- Isn't this the place?
- This should be it.

853
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:06,420
I heard she had gone into hiding.
What is going on?

854
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,659
- Why isn't she here yet?
- Maybe she's already here.

855
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,500
Oh! Hey, look. Isn't that Lee Kwon Sook?

856
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,199
- Yes, I think it's her.
- Right?

857
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:18,829
- She's here. Lee Kwon Sook!
- Get her!

858
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:20,800
- Stop!
- Kwon Sook, wait!

859
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,000
Get her on camera!

860
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,139
Wait!

861
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:24,739
- Go, hurry!
- Get her!

862
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:26,679
- Stop! Let's talk!
- Lee Kwon Sook!

863
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:28,579
- One moment! Wait up!
- Kwon Sook!

864
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:30,050
- Why is she so fast?
- Wait!

865
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:32,480
- I've never seen a woman run this fast.
- Wait! Let's talk!

866
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:35,449
- Could we please interview you?
- Go, hurry.

867
00:53:35,449 --> 00:53:36,989
Hurry! Get her!

868
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:38,550
- Wait!
- My gosh.

869
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:45,730
Wait!

870
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,300
Come here.

871
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:53,940
Darn it.

872
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:57,039
- Where is she?
- Where did she go?

873
00:54:19,429 --> 00:54:20,630
You jerk.

874
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:22,699
It was you.

875
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,369
You did this, didn't you?

876
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,570
If I can get you to sign the papers,

877
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,210
I'll do even worse stuff than this.

878
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:33,010
Like I said, I'd never go back.

879
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:36,440
I told you I would never go back
to the ring! Never!

880
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,079
You'll have to go back
unless you drop dead.

881
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:40,420
I will make you go back.

882
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:43,320
Then shall I just drop dead?
Is that what you want?

883
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:44,650
Go ahead and die, then.

884
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,619
That way, I can move on to someone else...

885
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:49,119
and stop wasting my time like this.

886
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,230
You crazy scumbag.

887
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,559
What do you get out of this?

888
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,599
Money?

889
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:00,139
My life.

890
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:01,670
Cut the nonsense.

891
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:03,670
You evil jerk.

892
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,210
If you follow me, I will kill you.

893
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,550
It's pointless to run away.

894
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:11,579
You can't get out of this.

895
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,050
I told you not to follow me.

896
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,519
Just 3 months would do. Only 2 games.

897
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:22,519
Just do that,
and I'll get out of your hair for good.

898
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,559
Get lost, will you?

899
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:29,130
Ms. Lee.

900
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:46,920
If I give up,

901
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,820
do you think this misery will end?

902
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,420
Even if I leave you alone,
someone else will come.

903
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,559
If that person leaves,
someone else will show up.

904
00:55:57,559 --> 00:55:59,230
After that,
someone else will come for you.

905
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,099
You can keep running, but people
will find you over and over again.

906
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:03,929
Why? Because you beat Estomata.

907
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,739
Boxing is your fate.
You can never run away from it.

908
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:09,269
I'll put my life on the line
to make sure you can't run away!

909
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,699
(Dongil Police Station)

910
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:39,199
(Report)

911
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:41,639
Sir, let me ask you just once more.

912
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:47,210
Are you sure
this lady was the one who hit you?

913
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,409
My jaw was dislocated.

914
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:55,150
I got folded in half.

915
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:58,389
Then I floated in the air
and fell to the ground.

916
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,320
Shut it, will you?

917
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:02,119
Be quiet. You did nothing to be proud of.

918
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:03,889
You did hit him, right?

919
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:05,659
Yes.

920
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:09,329
It requires three weeks of treatment.
That's quite serious.

921
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,369
So you won't settle?

922
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,940
No. Never.

923
00:57:16,539 --> 00:57:18,940
If you refuse to settle,
it'll get complicated.

924
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,179
Ms. Lee, you'll be indicted.

925
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,179
Settle it with him, or the case
will be handed over to the prosecution.

926
00:57:25,349 --> 00:57:26,449
You know what that means, right?

927
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,880
Hey!

928
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:32,019
You can't do that here.

929
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:33,789
Hello, Officers.

930
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,460
Goodness, how...

931
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:40,429
Are you all right?

932
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,099
A professional boxer
should never hit people.

933
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,840
I'm going to go ahead
and publish an exclusive on you.

934
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,309
Gosh, what are you going to do?

935
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:55,579
What if it scars?

936
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:56,579
Let me get the door for you.

937
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,949
Oh, boy. Are you all right? Be careful.

938
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:04,750
A boxer should never punch
ordinary people like us.

939
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,559
It could provide grounds
for additional punishment.

940
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,659
Kim, how many weeks?

941
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,559
Three weeks?

942
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:14,659
Then you'd have nothing to say even if
you ended up behind bars for assault.

943
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,469
Hey, Kim. You went too easy on her.

944
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,739
Anyhow,
you'll become famous again, Ms. Lee.

945
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,380
You'll either make a successful comeback
and end up in the sports section...

946
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,880
or see your name
among crime news headlines...

947
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,449
as an ex-boxer
who beat up an innocent civilian.

948
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,780
Make your choice wisely!

949
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:38,989
Gosh, poor you.

950
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:43,159
At this rate, you'll die
while trying to persuade her to return.

951
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,590
What if all our efforts end up in vain?

952
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:48,000
Gosh, she seemed very feisty.

953
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,429
She's still a kid though.

954
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,869
I'm sure
it was enough to scare her at least.

955
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:54,340
Let's go.

956
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,170
Wait. They haven't called you, have they?

957
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,909
Kim Hee Won. They've decided to oust him.

958
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,179
What?

959
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,480
I heard it from someone on the inside.

960
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,949
They'll announce it officially soon.

961
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:13,960
Darn it.

962
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,900
You'll announce the decision
when the season isn't even over yet?

963
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,159
Are you trying
to make him a franchise star...

964
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,300
so he can't retire from Cheetahs?

965
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:27,800
"Star?"

966
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,139
If it were any other team,
he'd be a backup player forever.

967
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:32,469
He's a pro
when it comes to bases on balls.

968
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:34,309
- Why couldn't he do it when I told him...
- You jerk.

969
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,010
Are you really his manager?

970
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,610
The match fixing failed,

971
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,849
so he fell out of favor with you.
That's why you're kicking him out!

972
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:45,019
Fine.

973
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,420
I admit that I can't stand him.

974
00:59:47,989 --> 00:59:49,460
It's all true,

975
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,090
but he needs to be treated.

976
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,260
His shoulders are all messed up.

977
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,500
His shoulders, not his elbows.

978
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,599
When will he undergo surgery
and make a comeback?

979
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,929
When he's 40?

980
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,400
Is he Park Chul Soon?
Does he think he's Song Jin Woo?

981
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:03,809
Gosh.

982
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,820
This is on the house. Enjoy.

983

You're confident
that you'll get picked, right?

Yes, of course.

Come on, I'll help you!

1023

I'll make sure no one comes to you,

1024
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,650
so you won't have to hide anymore.

1025
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:41,250
I'll help you quit boxing
for the rest of your life!

Stop lying.

1027
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,329
At the end of the day,
you want to take advantage of me too.

1028
01:04:57,329 --> 01:05:00,030
You're doing this because you need money!
I know that too!

1029
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,969
You can use me too then!

I'll get you the biggest match ever.

Then you can lose and retire afterward.

1033
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:15,250
If you lose,
you will no longer be a genius boxer.

The world doesn't remember losers!

1035

No one will come to you or bother you.

1036

Do you think that's going to work?

1037

I'll help you.

1046

I will...

1047
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:03,059

01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,659
You don't know anything about boxing.

Who do you think will win?

1058
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,800
Gosh. She couldn't have picked
a worse time to pass away.

1059
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,469
Sit back down.

1060
01:07:17,469 --> 01:07:18,809
I really don't want her to lose.

1061

- Hey, stop it.
- Hey, don't be ridiculous.

1062

01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,579
No.

1064
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:28,820
You think she lost her focus?
She can get it back.

1065
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:30,219
Are you okay?

1066
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,489
Quit asking me that. Just drink.

1067
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,300

1068

no one talked about her.

1069
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:54,809
My mom was gone.

1070
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:00,480
Without her in the world,
I had no reason to box anymore.

1071
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,760
I took my mom with me...

1072
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:12,789
and ran away.

1073
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,670
Kwon Sook is in great shape.
Too great, if you ask me.

1074
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:24,569
But who's going to fight her
in the first round?

1075
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:25,869
I bet you want to smack me.

1076
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:28,380
She's not an athlete.
She's more like a performer.

1077
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,810
She earns money with the attention
she gets, not with the boxing matches.

1078
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:33,210
Do you have to rig the game?

1079
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:34,619
You're that infamous son of a witch.

1080
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:35,880
How did you sweet-talk my daughter
into doing this?

1081
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,920
Do you have something on her?
Did you threaten her or something?

1082
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:40,090
I won't say anything. Don't worry.

1083
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:41,659
I'm asking you a question. Answer me now!

1084
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,560
Staying at hotels can be risky too.

1085
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,560
Stay here for the time being.

1086
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,890
With you?

1087
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:48,029
I don't like this either.
It's uncomfortable for me too.

1088
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:49,500
Are you crazy?

1089
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:50,970
Didn't Mr. Kim Tae Young...

1090
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:53,130
tell you he would take you
to the place you wanted to go?

1091
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,640
That's what he does.

1092
01:08:54,939 --> 01:08:57,569
He has the athletes under his thumb.

1093
01:08:57,569 --> 01:08:58,970
And he does whatever he wants
to do with them.

1094
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:00,270
Have you given it some thought?

1095
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:02,039
I won't do it.

1096
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,310
Can I...

1097
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,750
really trust you?
