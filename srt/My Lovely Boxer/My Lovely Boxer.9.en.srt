Ahjussi, where are we going?

I'll no longer be involved in your match.

You promised you'd let me retire.

5

My job is done.

6
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,874
I created a match everyone's interested in.

7
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:21,564
What would happen if I said I'd go to the US, then?

Finish the match and retire as you promised.

I'll find a new client.

14

My company will get you a new lodging.

Stay at my place until then.

16

Talk to the company if you need to ask for something.

Say it again.

18

What? You told her to lose the match?

19
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:33,544
You were wrong, you bastard.

20
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:36,534
That's not for Kwon Suk.

21
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:37,874
I know.

22
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:43,994
I took advantage of the fact that she wanted to quit boxing.

23
00:01:43,994 --> 00:01:45,624
Why?

24
00:01:45,624 --> 00:01:47,554
Was it because of money?

25
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:49,044
Yes.

26
00:01:49,044 --> 00:01:51,964
How dare you say that right now?

27
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:03,604
Do you...

28
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:08,114
know why I retired before a title match?

29
00:02:08,114 --> 00:02:10,364
Wasn't it because of an injury?

30
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:13,524
You had a chronic fracture on your hand.

31
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:15,794
It was an excuse.

32
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:19,214
An excuse I barely came up with to run away.

33
00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:21,104
Do you want to know the truth?

34
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,914
I was afraid.

35
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:29,074
I was afraid to death to

I was scared.

Do you know what was funny after I gave up on the title?

39
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:41,224
What was it?

40
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:45,624
They said I was an unlucky boxer who could've become a lightweight world champion.

41
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:50,014
Isn't that funny?

42
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:52,904
They thought a coward like me had potential.

43
00:02:55,834 --> 00:03:01,214
While I was secretly preparing to come back after I retired,

44
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,894
I saw Kwon Suk's punch.

45
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:06,554
After that day, I totally gave up on boxing

46
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:09,184
and pushed Kwon Suk instead of myself.

47

I...

48

ran away completely until the end

49

by even using my daughter.

50
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:23,614
You said that Kwon Suk wants to finish what happened three years ago.

51
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:25,574
I was happy.

52
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:27,794
I thought she was an adult

54
00:03:31,364 --> 00:03:34,684
different from me, who ran away cowardly.

But you're trying to kill her alive right now.

56

You're making her regret this for the rest of her life.

00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:56,374
What brings you here?

170
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:58,824
Suk told me to come.

171
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:01,154
Suk? Kwon Suk did?

172
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:02,414
Yes, she said she'd feed us.

173
00:15:02,414 --> 00:15:05,424
She said she'd stay here until the match ends.

174
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:22,024
What are you doing? Won't you take orders?

175
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:24,084
Y-Yes, yes.

176
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:25,224
Have a seat.

177
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,694
Okay.

178
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:27,954
Have a seat.

179
00:15:27,954 --> 00:15:29,894
What would you like?

180
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:34,114
I need to have a seolleongtang. Champion seolleongtang.

181
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:35,824
It'd be an honor.

182
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,664
Me, too.

183
00:15:38,664 --> 00:15:40,774
I'll have the same.

184
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,934
Three seolleongtangs.

185
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:45,734
Less broth. A lot of meat.

186
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:47,694
Yes, okay.

187
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:55,284
Wow. Looking at both of you, you resemble your father-

188
00:15:56,514 --> 00:15:59,454
Is it just her eyes? You know what I mean?

189
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:05,604
Okay. Get in position. Let's go. Start.

190
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:08,164
<i>- One, two. One, two.</i>
- Good job.

191
00:16:08,164 --> 00:16:10,184
One, two. Hey, where are you going?

192
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:13,014
- Come here, come here.
<i>- One, two. One, two.</i>

193
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,424
You have to do it with your friends.

194
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:16,624
That's right. Keep going.

195
00:16:16,624 --> 00:16:18,244
Gosh, so loud.

196
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,494
I can't ever teach kids.

197
00:16:20,494 --> 00:16:22,034
Hey, you'll fall! You'll fall!

198
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:24,394
He hasn't changed at all.

199
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:26,684
- Huh?
- My dad.

200
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:29,804
He's trying to create a monster like me again.

201
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:33,204
- Geez, whatever!
- It doesn't seem like that at all.

202
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:36,614
- Hey, that's cheating!
- You don't know my dad.

203
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:38,884
- Yes, yes! That's right!
-Is that so?

204
00:16:38,884 --> 00:16:42,364
Back to position. That's right. You're good. That's how you do it.

205
00:16:42,364 --> 00:16:43,694
By the way, Coach.

206
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:44,974
Yes.

207
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:48,024
Haven't you heard from Ahjussi?

208
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:49,304
No.

209
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:52,194
- That's right. That's it. One, two.
<i>- One, two. One, two...</i>

210
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:54,634
Last night,

211
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:58,654
he suddenly dropped me off here and left.

212
00:16:58,654 --> 00:17:01,634
I stopped by his place this morning,

213
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:04,254
but he changed his passcode.

214
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:07,804
- Geez. Seriously.
- Back to position. That's right.

215
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:11,174
- You know why he's doing this, right?
- That's how you do it.

216
00:17:11,174 --> 00:17:13,224
Tell me if you know anything.

217
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:15,574
I don't really know how he feels.

218
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:17,334
He rarely talks about his feelings.

219
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:18,614
That's right!

220
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:21,814
He just told me to keep doing what I've been doing.

221
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:25,394
<i>- One, two. One, two. One, two.</i>
- That's right.

222
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:27,434
Come here. Y-You're about to fall.

223
00:17:27,434 --> 00:17:30,714
Hold on. Do it together. Yes, do it together.

224
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:35,114
Gosh, you scared me.

225
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:38,464
Agent Kim, why did you show up without notice?

226
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:41,284
- Will you buy me a coffee?
- Why aren't you writing the article?

227
00:17:41,284 --> 00:17:45,264
I will. Do I ever break promises?

228
00:17:46,924 --> 00:17:48,534
Do you want some coffee?

229
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:56,724
I drink iced coffee even when it's freezing.

230
00:17:58,094 --> 00:17:59,834
Gosh, you're so impatient.

231
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:02,784
I need some caffeine to wake myself up.

232
00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:05,874
Okay, okay.

233
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:10,574
I'm preparing a special three-part article.

234
00:18:10,574 --> 00:18:12,654
"The truth about fixing games in pro sports."

235
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:15,484
The first part will be about Kim Hui Won.

236
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:19,724
Did you come all the way here to ask me about that?

237
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,364
Look someone up for me.

238
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:22,844
Who?

239
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:27,024
Sky Sports?

240
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,484
[Section Chief Kim O Bok]

241
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:31,824
He's a distributor at an illegal gambling house.

242
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:34,694
Above him, there's a man called Chairman Nam In Gyu.

243
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:41,144
Could this be regarding Kim Hui Won?

244
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:44,574
Don't ask any more questions.

245
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:49,744
Okay. I'll look into it. Buy me a drink. An expensive kind.

246
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:54,444
No, if I'm lucky, it'd be a scoop.

247
00:18:54,444 --> 00:18:56,204
Should I treat you instead?

248
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:57,924
Kim O Bok.

249
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:02,934
No. Are you crazy?
[Resignation Letter]

250
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,424
What will our team do?

251
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:08,884
I even let you get out of Lee Kwon Suk's match, too.

252
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:12,384
I should be begging you not to be on a break. But you're quitting?

253
00:19:13,624 --> 00:19:16,164
Have you been scouted somewhere, by chance?

254
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:19,844
I would've bragged about it to everyone if that were the case.

255
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:22,084
You're so annoying.

256
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:25,794
I know you're having a hard time,

257
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:28,404
but it's better to work at times like this.

258
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:32,174
It's the FA Cup season. Are you joking right now?

259
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:36,784
Make someone an up-and-coming player and scout a star.

260
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:39,864
I'll consider if I'll let you go or not then.

261
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:44,534
I still can quit after a month.

262
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:46,614
I know, too.

263
00:19:46,614 --> 00:19:48,944
You think only you know.

264
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:50,744
That's just how I feel.

265
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:52,194
Get out.

266
00:19:58,344 --> 00:20:01,784
Agent Kim, Ms. Lee is here right now.

267
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,144
- Ms. Lee Kwon Suk?
- Yes.

268
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,164
Geez.

269
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:29,914
What did you want to talk about?

270
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:34,424
I came because I wanted to talk to you as your client.

271
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:40,364
Yesterday, you only said what you wanted to say and left.

272
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:44,004
Okay. Go ahead.

273
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:48,014
Is it okay to switch the person in charge without the client's approval?

274
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:51,184
Does the contract say I can't do that?

275
00:20:53,344 --> 00:20:54,774
If so,

276
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:58,954
how about the fact that you betrayed my trust all this time?

277
00:20:58,954 --> 00:21:03,674
How about trying to send me to the US without my consent and neglecting me for a while?

278
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:05,214
So?

279
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:08,114
Will you break off the contract?

280
00:21:09,054 --> 00:21:11,374
How about the match?

281
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:13,734
Will you still do the match?

282
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:18,284
I'm not really sure.

283
00:21:19,184 --> 00:21:21,924
I'm confused about everything right now.

284
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:26,174
How could you do this?

285
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:28,494
You said you'd let me quit boxing.

286
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:30,654
You suggested running away from the ring.

287
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:32,334
You told me to trust you.

288
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,104
But how could you leave like this?

289
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:39,074
I had all sorts of thoughts all night.

290
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:42,104
"Should I just go to the US with Ahjussi?"

291
00:21:42,104 --> 00:21:44,084
I even thought that, too.

292
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:46,124
-We're done talking about that.
- I know.

293
00:21:46,124 --> 00:21:48,854
I really don't want to go to the US.

294
00:21:49,764 --> 00:21:51,664
But...

295
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:54,994
I hate saying goodbye to you even more.

296
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:04,784
I know you think I'm foolish.

297
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:10,734
I don't know why I'm doing this, either.

298
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:13,194
But...

299
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:17,124
that's...

300
00:22:19,914 --> 00:22:24,084
just how I feel right now.

301
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:33,094
Let me know when you get things sorted out.

302
00:22:33,094 --> 00:22:37,834
I'll terminate the contract without penalty if you don't want to have the match.

303
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:41,294
This is all I can do for you right now.

304
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,494
The sooner you decide, the better.

305

Why do you teach kids how to box?

329
00:25:39,286 --> 00:25:41,926
You want to create monsters like me again?

330
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,079
Weight loss and kids. Those are the only ways to make money these days.

331
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:52,299
You're talking about money again.

332
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:55,089
It's not money. It's reality.

333
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:58,809
Also, I don't force anyone anymore.

334
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,469
I only teach the ones who want to learn.

335
00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:02,049
You're lying.

336
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,809
I'm sure you'd show your true color again.

337
00:26:07,229 --> 00:26:09,019
I don't trust you.

338
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,769
There's nothing I can do about it, then.

339
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:15,969
Don't meddle with my gym.

340
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:18,089
I won't meddle with your match, either.

341
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:21,789
You'd better keep your promise.

342
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,569
I'll leave home the moment you meddle.

343
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:26,479
Don't act so proud.

344
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:28,529
Don't worry, okay?

345
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:31,669
Let's go downstairs so I can turn the lights off.

346
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:34,579
I'll stay here just for a moment.

347
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:36,329
Don't stay for too long.

348
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:37,939
It's cold even with the heater on.

349
00:26:37,939 --> 00:26:39,619
You'll catch a cold.

350
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:00,799
<i>Will you still do the match?</i>

351
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,239
<i>Let me know when you get things sorted out.</i>

352
00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:10,629
This sound is not coming from my mouth.

353
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,879
It's coming from your fists.

354
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,149
Yes. One, two.

355
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:19,259
Your punches are too weak. Let's use a special move.

356
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:21,159
Tornado punch.

357
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,779
Tornado punch.

358
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:25,049
That's right. Good job.

359
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,659
Hey, kiddo.

360
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:30,569
If you set your feet that far apart,

361
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:33,979
your form would get ruined when you switch play.

362
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:36,079
Why are you discouraging him?

363
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,599
Why are you meddling with my business?

364
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,899
You promised you wouldn't.

365
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:43,249
I'm not meddling. I'm teaching him the basics.

366
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:45,369
That's meddling, punk.

367
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:46,899
Just focus on your training.

368
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:48,659
Wow.

369
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,399
Okay. I won't say anything anymore.

370
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:55,009
It's okay. It's okay. You did great. Really great.

371
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:56,839
Okay, that's it for today.

372
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,779
You can stay and play if you want.

373
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:01,399
Stand straight. Bow.

<i>- Thank you.</i>
- Yes. Well done.

Auntie, you're Lee Kwon Suk, right?

Auntie?

I'm not Auntie. I'm Noona.

378

Auntie, I heard your punches are really strong.

379

I'm not Auntie. I'm Noona.

Can you show us sandbagging just once? Please?

382

- Please.
- Just once. Please.

383

Do you think I'm good?

<i>Yes!</i>

00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:53,019
Hey, you can all leave now.

390
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,099
Agent Kim.

391
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:15,059
Let's talk inside.

392
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:22,479
Gosh, I'm tired.

393
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:26,259
I drank all night because of this last night.

394
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:29,679
I spent money and spent my liver, too.

395
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,029
Gosh.

396
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:41,169
Let's make this clear first.

397
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:45,449
This has to do with Kim Hui Won, right?

398
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:48,779
It needs to have a connection with the special story, so I...

399
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:54,189
Gosh, I'm stupid for asking.

400
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:57,379
First of all, Sky Sport's Kim O Bok.

401
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,889
The background check didn't tell me much about him.

402
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:04,199
He supplied used phones to foreign countries, and he sold used cars for a bit.

403
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:06,799
He went to a physical education college. For judo.

404
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,379
Judo?

405
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,049
Why?

406
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,089
It's nothing.

407
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:21,129
How about Nam In Gyu, then?

408
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:22,959
He's daebak.

409
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:27,099
He did run a private gambling website in 2015.

410
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,899
I guess it was hugely successful back then.

411
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:30,739
He had 15 distributors

412
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:33,989
and he collected over 2 trillion won for betting money each day.

413
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:36,569
Two trillion per day.

414
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:39,189
<i>He had the HQ in the Philippines.</i>

415
00:30:39,189 --> 00:30:43,169
<i>The NIS barely managed to catch him by doing a cooperative investigation.</i>

416
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:47,019
You mean he's in prison in the Philippines now, then?

417
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,429
You think he is?

418
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,769
He got out by paying bail.

419
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:53,719
I guess he returned to Korea two years ago.

420
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,779
People don't know what he's doing now.

421
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:58,739
They don't know?

422
00:30:58,739 --> 00:30:59,959
He's quiet, apparently.

423
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:03,189
Because you can't get out by paying bail in Korea.

424
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:06,959
Maybe he kept doing what he was doing quietly.

425
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:12,239
I'm thinking of looking into this further.

426
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,819
How much do you know, Agent Kim?

427
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:20,639
I know a bit about Hui Won.

428
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:22,819
You pretended you didn't.

429
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:24,899
I knew it.

430
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:29,519
Help me catch these bastards.

431
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,979
I'll tell you everything I know.

432
00:31:32,979 --> 00:31:36,469
I can give you all the evidence I have, too.

433
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,299
To me?

434
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:43,219
How much are you involved in this?

435
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:48,319
Could you go to jail for this, by chance?

436
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:03,029
How can I help you?

437
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:13,999
Yu Ri.

438
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,679
<i>Yu Ri!</i>

439
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,539
- It's been so long!
- Have you been well?

440
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:37,549
- Thanks for the food.
- Thank you.

441
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:39,369
Take care.

442
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:41,189
Let me clean up, Father.

443
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:42,639
Seolleongtang is ready for Kwon Suk's table.

444
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:45,379
Seriously. I told you not to call me "Father."

445
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:47,019
Yes, Father.

446
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:50,949
Geez.

447
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,989
Okay. Here we go.

448
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,429
Just go ahead and try it first.

449
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:01,169
Here you go.

450
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:04,659
Our broth is out of this world.

451
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:06,249
We'll enjoy it.

452
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:09,099
Wow, this is so crazy. Look how white the broth is.

453
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:10,739
- Wow, this looks amazing.
- It looks so good.

454
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,029
I know. You can see the grains on the beef.

455
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:16,959
Wow, doesn't it look amazing?

456
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:22,739
Why did you come here?

457
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:25,969
There was no way for me to reach you.

458
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:27,779
I wanted to apologize somehow.

459
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,479
Apologize?

460
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,209
You said you wasted time.

461
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,369
You said I played you.

462
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:36,179
After hurting me so much,

463
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:38,559
you came to apologize because you felt uncomfortable?

464
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,669
I regretted it the moment I said it.

465
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:42,649
And I still do.

466
00:33:44,449 --> 00:33:47,239
I'm so embarrassed of myself, too.

467
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,129
I'm so sorry.

468
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:58,289
It might sound like an excuse, but I really like you.

469
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:02,279
You looked so cool and pretty in the ring.

470
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:08,049
I might've felt that way because you're a star boxer and famous.

471
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:12,289
Because I fell in love with the boxer Lee Kwon Suk. Not Lee Yu Ri, the TA.

472
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:15,909
So when you said you'd quit boxing,

473
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:19,759
I got angry without realizing it.

474
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:21,529
I felt hurt.

475
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:25,679
Okay.

476
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:28,859
I'm sorry for hurting you.

477
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:31,919
It's fine.

478
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:33,789
I forgot all about it already.

479
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,259
All of it?

480
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:41,379
I want you to just forget the bad part.

481
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:44,489
Wouldn't that be possible?

482
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:02,439
Yu Ri, see you on the day of the match.

483
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:05,079
Good luck training. Don't hurt yourself.

484
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,989
I won't.

485
00:35:08,169 --> 00:35:10,339
The kids are looking forward to it a lot.

486
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:11,909
It'd be our day off,

487
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,799
but they want to watch it together at the kindergarten.

488
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:16,289
I'll cheer for you.

489
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:18,809
You're the prettiest when you box.

Fighting.

00:58:17,115 --> 00:58:19,955
Gosh, seriously.

823
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:21,875
Just eat.

824
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:48,955
- Bye.
- Bye.

825
00:58:48,955 --> 00:58:51,215
Take care.

826
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:57,725
Hi.

827
00:58:57,725 --> 00:58:59,765
You remember me, right?

828
00:59:02,585 --> 00:59:07,275
Do you know what kind of person your grandpa is?

829
00:59:09,055 --> 00:59:11,955
- Your grandpa-
- What are you doing?

830
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:17,505
Why did you come this time?

831
00:59:17,505 --> 00:59:20,415
You told me not to call.

832
00:59:20,415 --> 00:59:22,715
That's why I came here.

833
00:59:25,485 --> 00:59:27,225
<i>Don't you know who drove him to do that?</i>

834
00:59:27,225 --> 00:59:29,825
<i>- We all did.
- "We all did"?</i>

835
00:59:29,825 --> 00:59:33,475
<i>How about you? You're not responsible at all?</i>

836
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:44,435
Go and pick the ones you want to eat.

837
00:59:44,435 --> 00:59:46,225
Yay.

838
00:59:53,525 --> 00:59:56,635
I gave you what you wanted, you bastard.

839
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:59,485
Are you kidding right now?

840
00:59:59,485 --> 01:00:00,945
You want to stop there?

841
01:00:00,945 --> 01:00:03,195
What do you want me to do?

842
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:07,925
What more do you want from me?

843
01:00:09,285 --> 01:00:12,895
I know you're working on the second Kim Hui Won.

844
01:00:12,895 --> 01:00:15,335
Who is that?

845
01:00:15,335 --> 01:00:17,615
There's nothing like that going on.

846
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:20,085
You're a broker that fixes games.

847
01:00:20,915 --> 01:00:22,945
I know you have someone.

848
01:00:22,945 --> 01:00:24,555
Hand him over.

849
01:00:27,215 --> 01:00:30,745
I'll lock up all of those bastards

850
01:00:33,965 --> 01:00:36,275
and make sure to wipe everything out.

851
01:00:37,695 --> 01:00:39,695
Hand it over by the end of the day.

855
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:13,665
<i>There's one in Korea, too. At botanical gardens.</i>

Hello?

<i>I'll no longer try to lose the match.</i>

867

<i>For you. And most importantly, for me.</i>

868

<i>How could I possibly do that?</i>

869
01:03:03,995 --> 01:03:05,115
<i>This is your first time here, right?</i>

870

<i>If this match doesn't go as planned, I'll really be finished.</i>

<i>You said you'd put bandage on me.</i>

873

<i>No.</i>
