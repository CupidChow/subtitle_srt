1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:05,080
So I just have one match left, right?

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:07,910
That's it, right?

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,679
US debut, perhaps?

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,089
The US?

5
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:16,350
Just one more match,
and then I can retire.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,429
Why are you all quiet?

7
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:22,530
You're making me nervous.

8
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,129
To tell you the truth, it would be a waste
if she only stayed in Korea.

9
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,399
She could compete in the US...

10
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,629
to go after the titles
at the four major sanctioning bodies.

11
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:31,739
Hey!

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,640
That's pretty cool.

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,009
Gosh, Korean boxing will be fun to watch.
It's been a while, you know.

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,750
Stop!

15
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,149
Hey, stop it.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,960
("Never make predictions, especially
about the future." By Casey Stengel)

17
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,429
(Episode 6)

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,370
My, it smells amazing.

19
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,879
I think water got into my phone.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,980
It won't turn on.

21
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,150
Oh, no.

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,480
You can't fix a water-damaged phone.

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,250
Go downtown tomorrow and get a new phone.

24
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,920
What's the rush?

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,819
Wait until you're back in Seoul.
I'll buy you a new phone.

26
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,730
I never asked you to buy me a new phone.

27
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,359
Everything's on this phone.

28
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:34,370
The pictures of me and Jae Min
and the texts from him.

29
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,799
If they were that important to you,
you should've backed them up.

30
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,769
Says the person
who suddenly pushed me into the sea.

31
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,310
Come on. You had fun too.

32
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,650
Eat up.

33
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,650
Gosh. I'm the only one
having chicken again?

34
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,659
I see chickens even in my dreams.

35
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,390
This is way better
than having to go on an extreme diet...

36
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,629
just before the weigh-in.

37
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,230
Try it.

38
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,370
Come on. Just try it.

39
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,590
It's good, isn't it?

40
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:33,490
- Look, she likes it.
- As if.

41
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,189
It's just a little better
than boiled chicken.

42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,830
Eat up.

43
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,900
Did you have some delicious food?

44
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:45,199
You're in a beach town.

45
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,039
(Ms. Yu Ri)

46
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,439
It doesn't matter.

47
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,539
I ate chicken.

48
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:51,879
It was precisely measured.

49
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,879
I only had five pieces of sashimi.

50
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,310
Gosh, that's so mean.

51
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,419
You know what?

52
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,919
He even brought a scale.

53
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:01,990
He's ridiculously strict.

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,159
Do you know what people call him?

55
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,460
Son of a witch. Jerk.

56
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,199
Gosh!

57
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:14,400
I can't believe you've been on the phone
for over an hour.

58
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,469
We were just about to hang up.

59
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,139
(Ms. Yu Ri)

60
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:19,240
Right?

61
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,469
That's right.

62
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,169
I've said this to you before.

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,509
She's no longer an ordinary woman.
She is a professional boxer.

64
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,050
Refrain from making long phone calls
at night.

65
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,020
Okay, we heard you.
Stop nagging, will you?

66
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,750
I'm only saying these things...

67
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,689
because he doesn't seem to know
who you are.

68
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,259
You still don't fully understand
how important it is for an athlete...

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,129
to have a regular routine, do you?

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,699
It's time you learned these things.

71
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,460
(Jae Min)

72
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,900
Yes, I'll learn.

73
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:51,300
However, isn't the athlete's
mental well-being as important as...

74
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,770
having a regular routine?

75
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,039
Helping her feel at ease.

76
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,979
Thanks for the advice.

77
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:00,009
I'm ending this call.

78
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,409
What? Mister!

79
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,550
Wait, let me say good night...

80
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,889
You're so mean.

81
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,090
Like I said, we were about to hang up.

82
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,520
Go to bed now, or you'll lose muscle mass.

83
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,689
Gosh, seriously.

84
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,930
Oh, I was just about to head inside.

85
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,540
You're having another beer?

86
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,269
Yes.

87
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,639
Go inside and comfort her
so she can get some sleep.

88
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,139
What did you do this time?

89
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,350
All right.

90
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,350
And see if you can find
a boxing gym in the area.

91
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,350
- Let's rent it for a few days.
- Okay.

92
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,839
Why did you come out? Go inside and sleep.

93
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,040
I'm upset because of someone.

94
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,939
I'll go back inside in ten minutes.

95
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:15,220
Set timer for ten minutes.

96
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,790
You have to go back inside
the moment you hear the alarm.

97
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,129
Okay.

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,370
You're head over heels
for the assistant director.

99
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:32,899
Don't let yourself fall too hard,

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,310
although I know it's not easy.

101
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:40,649
Mister.

102
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,149
I bet you've never failed
at anything in life.

103
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
Me?

104
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,389
That is complete nonsense.

105
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,519
You're always brimming with confidence.

106
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,459
The day when you first came to see me too.

107
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,730
Don't waste your time talking
to everyone who comes here.

108
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,300
Only talk to me.

109
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,370
Because I'm the best.

110
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:11,279
That day, I thought you were obnoxious
but envied you at the same time.

111
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,110
I thought, "I'm a coward,
so everything makes me nervous,"

112
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,680
"but he's different."

113
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,230
Do you know why I quit baseball?

114
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,500
Wasn't it because of your injury?

115
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,800
Every athlete gets injured.

116
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,040
My school was known for its baseball team.

117
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,839
I know. Yujin High School.

118
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,480
You and Kim Hee Won were batteries.

119
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,480
I was the main catcher...

120
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,120
only for a short while
when Hee Won was in 12th grade.

121
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,160
I was a mediocre player.

122
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,000
- Gosh, he's great.
- He's better than Tae Young.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He's really good.

124
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,600
- After Hee Won graduated,
- Gosh, that's nice.

125
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,670
I had no doubt that
I would be the main catcher.

126
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,269
But my junior outperformed me.

127
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,910
I had no chance of getting drafted.

128
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,279
When getting into college
became uncertain for me,

129
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,680
I suddenly got scared.

130
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,879
(Baseball Team)

131
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:27,449
(Baseball Team)

132
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,459
So I ran away...

133
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,860
because I didn't want
to feel like a loser.

134
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,459
"Fine. Let's see."

135
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,129
"Do you think you can even pass..."

136
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,170
"the preliminary round
at the national championship without me?"

137
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,040
I was so spiteful and cursed them.

138
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,009
So what happened?

139
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,879
They won.

140
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,009
Two years in a row
at Bonghwangdaeki Baseball Championship.

141
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,819
I didn't get into any colleges.

142
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:00,050
With the money
my mom earned by selling fruits,

143
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,319
I signed up for an academy
for CSAT re-takers.

144
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,160
When you keep trying out
for something you're not talented in,

145
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,529
you face a series of failures like me.

146
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,829
So think about how lucky you are.

147
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,670
You were born with a talent for boxing.

148
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:20,470
Whether you liked it or not,

149
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,009
you mastered the basics as a kid.

150
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,810
And you have me, the best agent.

151
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,250
Gosh, look at you bragging again.

152
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:32,379
Let me ask you something.

153
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,720
There really isn't anything
you want to try out?

154
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,519
Not at all.

155
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,120
Don't you want the champion belt?

156
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:41,629
The belt...

157
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
is too big and heavy.

158
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,600
Then what are you interested in?

159
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,399
There must be something
you want to do, though.

160
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,210
There is.

161
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,740
What is it?

162
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Gosh.

163
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,950
You don't need to know that.

164
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:04,879
Gosh, what is it?

165
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,590
You don't need to know that.
Why do you keep asking?

166
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,889
What on earth is it?
You're making me more curious now.

167
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,419
Don't laugh at it then.

168
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:13,990
Of course, not.

169
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,600
Kissing.

170
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,279
This is why!

171
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,879
I told you not to ask me that.

172
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,549
You're so clueless sometimes.

173
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,139
I told you I could run by myself.

174
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,470
Don't you think I improved?

175
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,240
You've been running for a month now.

176
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,139
Even the kids from Hodong Kindergarten...

177
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,379
can run like you with some practice.

178
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:40,379
Gosh.

179
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,710
What about this?

180
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,789
If you want me to compliment you,
learn how to box properly.

181
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,789
Sir, 200 dollars a month is
all you need to invest.

182
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,259
Okay.

183
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:59,730
Hey, let's go downtown
after our breakfast.

184
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,730
I'll buy you a new phone.

185
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,830
Forget it.

186
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,169
I'll buy it myself.

187
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,710
Gosh, you and your pride.

188
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,879
I offered to buy it for you.
Just accept it.

189
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,450
Don't criticize me for my gesture.
You did that when I bought you clothes.

190
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,450
Darn it.

191
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,220
I won't fall for that twice.

192
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:24,889
You...

193
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:27,289
What's gotten into them?

194
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,259
Hey, slow down!

195
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:39,769
Wait up, Ah Reum.

196
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,210
What is it?

197
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,779
Let's slow down.

198
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:47,009
Gosh.

199
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:49,179
Must you make it obvious that you're old?

200
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,580
Hey! I'm not old!

201
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:55,149
Right. I'm old.
I'm too old to be doing this.

202
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,519
So you'd better show me respect.

203
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,389
- Okay, ma'am.
- Hey.

204
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,490
I'll get going first.
I don't want my body to cool down.

205
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,830
- See you at the gym later.
- Okay.

206
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:28,019
Excuse me.

207
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,019
Aren't you the world champion boxer,
Ms. Han Ah Reum?

208
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:39,059
Gosh, you're not so different either.

209
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,129
I knew that
you were running too fast earlier.

210
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,139
Ah Reum.

211
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
Are you crying?

212
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,370
No.

213
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,909
Yes, you are.

214
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,309
Your defense match got canceled.

215
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,110
It makes sense that you want to cry.

216
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,820
What do you say?
Do you want to lean on me and cry?

217
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,019
I said no!

218
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,860
Hey, it's okay. Why are you angry?

219
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,500
That's not why I'm crying.

220
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,629
I fell down.

221
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,899
I'm crying because it hurts.

222
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Hey.

223
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,240
Don't be ridiculous.

224
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,480
You've gotten beaten up more in the ring,
but you never cried.

225
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,490
It's okay.

226
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:02,409
(Lee Gweon Suk)

227
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,950
What's this?

228
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,220
The complete data
on Lee Gweon Suk's skills and stats.

229
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,720
(WBC Title 4th Defense Match)

230
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,789
This isn't right.

231
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:15,159
(Lee Gweon Suk)

232
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,730
(Move to Trash)

233
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,730
(Do you want to permanently erase
the items in the Trash?)

234
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,230
(Yes, No)

235
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,710
(Do you want to permanently erase
the items in the Trash?)

236
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,720
Coach, you're here early.

237
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,919
Gosh.

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,570
(Lee Gweon Suk)

239
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:14,419
Tae Young.

240
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
It's Soo Yeon.

241
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,820
What?

242
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,120
Soo Yeon is calling.

243
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,830
Why is she calling this early
in the morning?

244
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:24,029
Did you cause trouble?

245
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,100
Hey. What's up?

246
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:40,809
Hey.

247
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,110
- What about my mom?
- She's in the room.

248
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,679
Mom.

249
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,320
Gosh, you're here too.

250
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,590
You didn't have to come.

251
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,330
I just slipped at the store.

252
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,429
Mom, I told you to hire someone
to clean your store.

253
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:58,700
How many times must I say that?

254
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,600
Why do you always tell me
to spend money to get things done?

255
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,730
It's a tiny store.
I don't need to hire anyone for that.

256
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,470
What about the tests?
Did she do all the tests?

257
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:12,039
Yes. She did all the tests
the doctor recommended.

258
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,940
It was just a waste of money.

259
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:16,710
Soo Yeon was on her way to work.
She ended up taking care of me.

260
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,220
What was that called?

261
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,389
You know, the phone number they call
during emergencies.

262
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:24,860
I guess you two were listed
as my emergency contacts.

263
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,129
I was going to take you off the list,
but I forgot.

264
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,990
Don't take me off the list.

265
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,929
Just look what happened today.
He couldn't answer his phone.

266
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,330
Thank you.

267
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,629
Why don't you have a meal before you go?
It's been a while.

268
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,639
Gosh.

269
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,470
Where are you going? You're injured.

270
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,940
I don't have enough side dishes.

271
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,580
I can't let Soo Yeon eat just plain rice.

272
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,750
Who knows when I'll get to see her again?

273
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,379
Gosh. I'll go.

274
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,149
Mom, you're not young anymore.

275
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,850
You need to be careful.

276
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,059
You must be glad I'm old.

277
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,889
I'll keep him company.

278
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,079
He has the athletes under his thumb.

279
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,710
And he does whatever he wants
to do with them.

280
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,950
He did that to me too.

281
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,279
Mr. Kim was...

282
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:28,019
my agent in the past.

283
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,430
Sorry to eat this when you're on a diet.

284
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,329
If you mind the smell, shall I go indoors?

285
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,230
- It's fine.
- What's up with you?

286
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,400
You're not being snarky.

287
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,400
When was I snarky?

288
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,910
Sorry.

289
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,779
- Hey.
- What?

290
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,190
Are you close to the woman who called?

291
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,490
Who?

292
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,490
Oh, Soo Yeon?

293
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,559
Rather than being close,

294
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:11,759
we used to live together.

295
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,430
She was Tae Young's girlfriend.

296
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,930
Not anymore, though.

297
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:19,900
Why did they break up?

298
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:22,039
How would I know
about their personal lives?

299
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,740
But I am sure that she dumped Tae Young.

300
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:28,910
For real?

301
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,650
He's great at his job,

302
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,880
but he's useless when it comes to dating.

303
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:38,059
If you think about it, those two...

304
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,190
Get a big pack.

305
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,700
Why do you suddenly want noodles?

306
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,730
Your mother likes noodles.

307
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,799
Everyone knew they were a unit,

308
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,069
but now they're colleagues
as if nothing happened.

309
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:52,200
Come on.

310
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,400
Gosh. I could never do that.

311
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,740
How could you be friends
with someone you loved to death?

312
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:01,079
Tae Young was a moping mess
after they broke up.

313
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,380
What? Really?

314
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,109
He was?

315
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,450
He's not how he looks.

316
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,920
He's a romantic.

317
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,490
I think there's still something there.

318
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,759
Sometimes,
Soo Yeon comes over when she's drunk.

319
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:20,400
- To Mr. Kim's place?
- Yes.

320
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,670
It's so suspicious.

321
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,069
You won't even finish that?

322
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,240
I lost my appetite.

323
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,890
You're crossing the line.

324
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,460
You crossed it first.

325
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,259
What line did I cross?

326
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:52,630
Han Ah Reum.

327
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,630
I can handle my business.

328
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,769
You say that and you let
Kim Hee Won's team release him?

329
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,980
You're going a bit too far.

330
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,079
You always go too far.

331
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,079
I put my career on the line.

332
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:14,819
Why would you risk your career?

333
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,849
When I said I wanted to sign Han Ah Reum,

334
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,390
my boss said no.

335
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,630
I shouldn't try too hard
when she's no Lee Gweon Suk.

336
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,759
I suddenly became determined.

337
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,930
So I said I'd take the fall
if things didn't work out.

338
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,170
Too bad. It'll be hard
to find a new job at your age.

339
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,579
Are you stocking the fridge?

340
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,119
How many meals are you cooking?

341
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,920
It's for your mother,
you useless fool of a son.

342
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,190
My mom sells fruit for a living.

343
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,490
Right.

344
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,630
We got an extension for the defense match.

345
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,730
They said they'd give us two months.

346
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,230
Find another opponent
with those conditions.

347
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,299
You've been doing this for years,
and you can't even do that?

348
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:09,440
What's going on?

349
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,210
How are you?

350
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,980
I'm here because
I thought things wouldn't be great.

351
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,210
Forget it, then. I'll find someone myself.

352
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,490
Hye Jin.

353
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,319
Why are you back here?

354
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,759
Did you listen to what I said?

355
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,829
I happened to.

356
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,930
I'll find you an opponent.

357
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,440
He'll throw a fit
if he realizes we cut short...

358
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,079
our training to come back.

359
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,779
What should I say
that will make him less angry?

360
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:51,009
Let's think.

361
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,890
I'm Kim Tae Young...

362
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,220
Stop it.

363
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,390
You sound pathetic.

364
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,859
Okay. Let's just call him.

365
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,130
Gosh.

366
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,200
(Lucky Man)

367
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,329
He's psychic.

368
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,940
Go on ahead.

369
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
Hi.

370
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,750
You can't just come back
because she insisted.

371
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,980
You can't even control one athlete?

372
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,049
You know how stubborn she can be.

373
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,059
She said she'd train hard in Seoul.

374
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:36,089
I'll complete
her band training within the week.

375
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,329
How's your mother?

376
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,029
Now you ask?

377
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,730
She's fine.

378
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,200
Oh, good.

379
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,339
Tell her I miss her.

380
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:49,410
Okay.

381
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,690
(Mr. Kim at Sky)

382
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,769
Why are you calling this late?

383
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:20,069
Gosh, I'm glad you picked up.

384
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,970
I was wondering
if I should pay you a visit.

385
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,910
What is this about?

386
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,039
Oh, the thing is,

387
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,650
I must report to the chairman...

388
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,410
who the next match is against.

389
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,549
The return match was just two days ago.

390
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:35,490
Two days is a long time, isn't it?

391
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,220
I'll call when it's decided.

392
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,160
Are you aware the due date
for the interest is coming up?

393
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,099
What interest?

394
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,460
The money for Ye Jun's treatment.

395
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:49,130
The deal we signed with Kim Hee Won.

396
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,329
You agreed to take it over.

397
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,200
The interest rate is pretty high.

398
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,910
So schedule the next match soon.

399
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,009
Mr. Kim.

400
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,240
Why did you buy me clothes?

401
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,839
I bought them
so you could do laundry less often.

402
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,470
You won't try them on?

403
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,220
You're here.

404
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,359
Hi. Where's Mr. Kim?

405
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,660
- He won't come today?
- No. He didn't tell you?

406
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:54,930
He's off to get Han Ah Reum.

407
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,970
What?

408
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,009
(Three Teeth Knocked Out)

409
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,539
Tooth one.

410
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,980
Tooth two.

411
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,210
Tooth three.

412
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,750
Hello. It's a pleasure to be here.

413
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,589
Who are you?

414
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,619
You're so handsome.

415
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,990
- Silence.
- No.

416
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,799
I'm Kim Tae Young,
boxer Lee Gweon Suk's agent.

417
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,960
(Why is he so handsome?
Will this be a legend show?)

418
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,000
There's a huge response in the chatroom.

419
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,200
People are asking
if it'll be a legendary episode.

420
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,009
Mr. Kim, there's a reason
you wanted to be here?

421
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:36,769
Why do I think I know?

422
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:39,180
Wait. Is it really about that?

423
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,410
I'm here to challenge...

424
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,079
Ms. Han Ah Reum.

425
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,319
Great! I knew it.

426
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,150
We'd heard that
her defense match had been cancelled,

427
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,720
and we were so worried.

428
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,559
She's our only world champion,

429
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:55,559
and she needs that match to happen.

430
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,589
If she were to fight
Lee Gweon Suk instead?

431
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,799
- Even better.
- Even better.

432
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,359
But aren't they holding grudges
against each other...

433
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,170
because of what happened three years ago?

434
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,369
It won't be easy to persuade Ah Reum
to accept the request.

435
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:07,539
You could think of it
as a way of repentance.

436
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:08,539
(Three Teeth Knocked Out)

437
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:12,910
Back then, Gweon Suk caused such damage
even though she'd never intended it,

438
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,779
which is why she's reaching out a hand
to Ah Reum this time.

439
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,710
Yes, that's it.
This is what I'm talking about.

440
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,150
Whose fault is it that
the defense match got canceled?

441
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,750
All right, guys.

442
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,089
Since Lee Gweon Suk
is officially challenging her,

443
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,720
we should hear what she has to say.

444
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,990
Let's call and ask her now.

445
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:30,630
I'm calling her now.

446
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,829
(Three Teeth Knocked Out)

447
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:35,829
What's he saying?

448
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,930
Who is he calling?

449
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,369
Coach, don't answer...

450
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,910
Thank you for calling Giant Boxing.

451
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:49,450
Hello, Coach.

452
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,579
It's been a while. It's me,
Park Kyung Soo from "Sports K."

453
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:54,950
We're doing a live stream
for "Three Teeth Knocked Out" now.

454
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,950
You know, the show.

455
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,259
What's up, Reporter Park?

456
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:00,960
I'm surprised you called me.

457
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
Coach.

458
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,730
Sorry? What are you saying
out of the blue?

459
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,200
(Coach's Office)

460
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,529
I can't answer that now.

461
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,170
The defense match is around the corner,

462
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,769
and she's struggling to find an opponent.

463
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,569
It's such a shame, don't you think?

464
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,440
It is, but...

465
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,940
I won't do it.

466
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,779
What is with those people?

467
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,549
They called us while livestreaming?

468
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,849
What? I think
Han Ah Reum is standing next to him.

469
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,950
She sounds angry.

470
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,519
Hello, Coach Song. It's me, Kim Tae Young.

471
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:36,089
We'll take care of the expenses
for the title match. All of it.

472
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,829
For real? Coach Song.

473
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,759
- You really should do it.
- Just do it!

474
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,630
Tell them we won't do it and just hang up.

475
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,970
My goodness.

476
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,039
Don't tell me you're trying
to avoid it altogether.

477
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:51,240
But I get it.
Gweon Suk is such a strong fighter.

478
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,009
Hey, Mr. Kim. We're no strangers.

479
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,680
Get it straight.

480
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,579
Do you think Ah Reum would avoid Gweon Suk
because she's scared?

481
00:27:58,579 --> 00:27:59,819
Then could this be the reason?

482
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,890
Some champions pick
weak opponents on purpose.

483
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:06,089
(Three Teeth Knocked Out)

484
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,089
So they can keep their champion title.

485
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,990
That is not how we roll.

486
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,660
Ah Reum has no reason to avoid her.

487
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,759
Then let them fight.

488
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,500
What do you say?

489
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,099
I cannot concede any more.

490
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:26,109
Too bad.

491
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:29,609
- Then forget what I said...
- Let's do it.

492
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:33,819
Coach.

493
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,589
Ah Reum won't run away.

494
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,049
I'll be in touch.

495
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:45,799
Yes! Nice!

496
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,170
All right, guys.
The revenge match is happening.

497
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,069
This historic match
will really happen, guys!

498
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,240
We did it! This is amazing.

499
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,109
Nice. We did it.

500
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,480
Comments are pouring in!

501
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,910
What...

502
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:02,509
How could you tell him that we'd do it?

503
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,380
I told you I didn't want to do it.

504
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:06,849
People will criticize you
if you keep refusing to do it.

505
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:08,450
Let them criticize me all they want.

506
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:10,750
I really don't care.

507
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:12,190
I care.

508
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,960
Why should you be criticized
when you did nothing wrong?

509
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,430
You're a champion.

510
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,660
Do champions pick and choose
their opponents?

511
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,900
Wouldn't it be such a waste
if you lost your belt?

512
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,029
You can keep your championship belt,
so why run away?

513
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,029
It would be such a waste.

514
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,140
I'd hate to lose it!

515
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,839
But...

516
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,640
what can I do? I just don't want to do it.

517
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,809
I refuse to contend against her,
no matter what.

518
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,190
Ah Reum.

519
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,289
Gosh, that stubborn brat...

520
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,940
Oh?

521
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:02,069
Hey, where did you have to go?

522
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,269
We'd run out of milk.

523
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,440
What about you? Where have you been?

524
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,980
That's right. Coach said
you went to get Han Ah Reum.

525
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,150
Well...

526
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Oh, you're wearing that.

527
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,430
My gosh.

528
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,829
What are you looking at?

529
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:28,500
Were you stunned by my beauty
all of a sudden?

530
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,240
- What do you think?
- What are they all doing here?

531
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
My gosh.

532
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,980
- You're cute.
- Don't stare at me so intensely.

533
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,250
Gweon Suk.

534
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:48,990
What? Sweetie.

535
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,599
What is this?

536
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,900
I went ahead and got you a new phone.

537
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,430
Don't yell at me, please.

538
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,170
I did this because I was frustrated.

539
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:14,009
Ta-da.

540
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,690
Have you lost your mind?

541
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,990
It's not even a lot of money.
I can't believe...

542
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,089
Then what was I supposed to do?

543
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,759
My client said he wanted to sign up
for an annual membership.

544
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,259
Was I supposed to tell him to leave?

545
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:34,259
Since when was he your client?

546
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,769
Since the moment
the credit card transaction was approved.

547
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,599
You'd better cancel the transaction
at once.

548
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:40,400
No, I won't cancel it.

549
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,210
I've already signed up,
so I should do my best.

550
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,980
But what if you get hurt
while learning to box?

551
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,150
I'm taking the beginner's class anyway.

552
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,420
Oh, right. I'm planning an event
at the kindergarten this month.

553
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,250
An event?

554
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,019
How about you come and teach boxing?

555
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,759
The kids won't stop going on
about how much they miss you.

556
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,960
Really? Yes, I'll do it.

557
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,230
My gosh. I really miss the kids.

558
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
I'll be there.

559
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,299
But your agent probably won't let you.

560
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,200
Don't you worry about that.

561
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,900
I'll sneak out if I have to.

562
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:19,410
Yesterday, I watched some videos and
taught myself how to do the one-two combo.

563
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,410
Do you want to see it?

564
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,859
Well...

565
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,859
All right. Do exactly what I do.

566
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:41,099
Okay.

567
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:44,529
Stand with your feet slightly wider
than shoulder-width apart.

568
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,299
Step back with the right foot, diagonally.

569
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:48,769
Step back.

570
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,410
Shift 70 percent of your weight to your
right foot. The left foot, 30 percent.

571
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:56,009
Guard up.

572
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:57,779
Like this?

573
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,250
Well...

574
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,150
Like this.

575
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,470
All right.

576
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,470
Now, we'll try the one-two punch.

577
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:19,869
Okay.

578
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,000
One, two.

579
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,039
One, two.

580
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:26,809
One, two.

581
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,940
One, two.

582
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,579
One, two, three, four.

583
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,579
One, two, three, four!

584
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,490
One, two, three, four, five, six.

585
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:43,460
One, two, three, four...

586
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,519
I should practice a lot
to do it properly, right?

587
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,690
For someone who has never done it before,
you did...

588
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
a really great job.

589
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,489
Did I?

590
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,030
Just talk casually to me.

591
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Shall I?

592
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,110
All right, then.

593
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,519
Let's go.

594
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,210
Gosh.

595
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Hey.

596
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,179
I got a call from Taiwan.

597
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,579
(One-dollar bill accepted)

598
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,949
Do you want to take the test
to join the club?

599
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,989
I'm trying to talk to them
so they'll forgo the test for you, but...

600
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,960
Yes, I should take the test.

601
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,630
Who'd accept me without testing me first?

602
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,369
Well, I should still try.

603
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,369
If it gets finalized,

604
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,010
join them for just three years.

605
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,679
After that, I'll make sure
you can return to Korea no matter what.

606
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,010
Gosh.

607
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,550
I'm not young anymore, you see.

608
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Thanks for the offer though.

609
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,019
Well, how about another game?

610
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:53,889
You'll regret saying that.

611
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,829
I won't go easy on you anymore.

612
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,630
(Right side)

613
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
Two, three, four...

614
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,309
Mister. There's something
I want to run by you.

615
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,909
That hurts. Why did you slap my hand?

616
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:47,440
Eat it at the scheduled time.

617
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:51,280
Starting today, you'll be
on a salt-free diet for a week.

618
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,920
Gosh, come on.

619
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,550
Besides, you gained more body fat.

620
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,420
You've been eating behind my back, right?

621
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,360
Whatever.

622
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,230
- Mister.
- What?

623
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,869
Well,

624
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,409
have you ever...

625
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:23,179
asked a woman
to be in a relationship with you?

626
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,079
Why do you ask?

627
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:29,550
Han Jae Min didn't ask you yet?

628
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,050
I didn't say that.

629
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:35,519
Hey, if you're curious, just ask him...

630
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:36,760
if you guys are dating.

631
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:39,460
What if I ask him
and he says that we're not?

632
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,900
I had already asked him out once.

633
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,000
But he turned me down that time.

634
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,369
Him who?

635
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,039
Oh, you mean Han Jae Min?

636
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,510
Yes.

637
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:57,949
Gosh. Things have changed now.

638
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,820
Back then, you were Lee Yu Ri.

639
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:01,880
You're Lee Gweon Suk now.

640
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,719
Does that make a difference?

641
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,559
Yes, it does.

642
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,360
Really?

643
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,469
I told you to eat it
at the scheduled time.

644
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,099
Besides, a guy problem should be
the last thing on your mind.

645
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,440
Did you master the training drills
with the bands?

646
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,570
Darn you.

647
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:31,480
I'm here to challenge...

648
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:34,119
Ms. Han Ah Reum.

649
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,690
- Great! I knew it.
- Gosh, so this is what he meant?

650
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,420
We'd heard that
her defense match had been cancelled,

651
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,760
- What are you watching?
- Gosh, you startled me.

652
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:44,829
She's our only world champion,

653
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:46,400
and she needs that match to happen.

654
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,429
What's this?

655
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:48,860
If she were to fight
Lee Gweon Suk instead?

656
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,900
- Even better.
- Even better.

657
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,929
But aren't they holding grudges
against each other...

658
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,500
because of what happened three years ago?

659
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:57,969
That was just wrong.

660
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,280
How could you call him
in the middle of a livestream...

661
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,980
and pressure him to agree to the match?

662
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,409
If you keep cornering him...

663
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:06,550
Then what? Do you have any other plans?

664
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,150
But still.

665
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,559
It was too rude of you
to use the livestream.

666
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:17,030
Did you have to go that far?

667
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,460
You told me to do it right
if I was going to do this.

668
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,260
You were the one who told me to get
a match with Han Ah Reum no matter what.

669
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,840
My life depends on this match.

670
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,889
(Giant Boxing)

671
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,260
Hey, aren't you Ms. Lee Gweon Suk?

672
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:56,429
Yes.

673
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:58,300
Are you here to see Ah Reum?

674
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:04,840
Yes.

675
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,880
She went to her part-time job.

676
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,179
Do you want to wait here?
I'll tell her to come by once she's done.

677
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,510
No.

678
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:13,750
I'll just get going.

679
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,519
Hey.

680
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:19,389
Did you have dinner?

681
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,219
What?

682
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,360
Gosh, their jokbal was amazing.

683
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,889
- You must eat there often.
- Yes.

684
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,130
Hey, isn't that Kim Hee Won?

685
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,230
Yes, he is.

686
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,639
I don't recognize the other two.
Do you know them, Coach Hong?

687
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,070
No.

688
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,969
Come to think of it,
before he got kicked out of his team,

689
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,309
wasn't there a rumor?

690
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:41,480
I see.

691
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,650
What rumor?

692
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,710
Some weird guys came,
put him in a car, and drove away.

693
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:48,179
I heard it from the players of Cheetahs.

694
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:51,849
Those guys showed up everywhere.
The stadium and the dorm.

695
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,119
You just name it.

696
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,460
The doors are opening.

697
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,829
Let's go.

698
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,500
The doors are closing.

699
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,909
The fifth floor.

700
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:26,860
I heard that
you were going to Taiwan soon.

701
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:28,489
So a team made an offer.

702
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,360
Yes.
Luckily, I didn't have to do a tryout.

703
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,260
So things got finalized
faster than planned.

704
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:35,199
This is your first time playing abroad,
right?

705
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,530
Yes.

706
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:40,070
Gosh, you're going to miss your family.
That's awful.

707
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:43,369
I saw the other day that
your son was so adorable.

708
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,190
I know that I didn't keep my promise.

709
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,860
I will do everything I can
to take responsibility.

710
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:06,030
Gosh, no.

711
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,059
I wasn't asking you
to take responsibility.

712
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:13,300
You no longer have any responsibility
for that incident now.

713
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,110
Mr. Kim is taking full responsibility
for that now.

714
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,539
He promised to pay us 2.5 million dollars,
the monetary loss our company faced,

715
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,539
in three months.

716
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,920
Did you say 2.5 million dollars?

717
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:34,619
But you only gave me 500,000 dollars.

718
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:39,130
Are you telling me two million dollars
was the damage I caused that day?

719
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,300
Gosh.

720
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:44,099
We were generous with the figure too.

721
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:47,239
I guess
Mr. Kim didn't tell you everything.

722
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,070
Goodness.

723
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,739
You have a great friend.

724
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:53,409
Or should I say a great agent?

725
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,250
No agent in the world...

726
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,980
would dive into the fire
to pay back the debt for his athlete.

727
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,150
Why did you want to see me today?

728
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:11,090
If...

729
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,500
there's a way...

730
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,630
to take care of this on your own,

731
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,170
what will you do?

732
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,239
It's not that hard.

733
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,880
Are you interested in...

734
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,250
taking care of this on your own?

735
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:11,090
Mr. Kim Hee Won?

736
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,590
Gosh. It is you, Mr. Kim.

737
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,559
Gosh, what a coincidence.

738
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,329
What brings you here?

739
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,269
Well, I'm here to see a friend of mine.

740
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:25,800
Oh, I see.

741
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,300
I heard you were going to Taiwan.

742
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,170
Allow me to write an article about that.

743
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,610
Sure. Of course.

744
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,670
Excuse me then.

745
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:34,539
Okay. Bye.

746
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,719
Mr. Kim, good luck in Taiwan!

747
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,820
(Paran Tour)

748
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,690
What kind of business is that?

749
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:54,099
(Paran Tour)

750
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,769
(Paran Tour)

751
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:01,940
Do you have business here?

752
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:05,610
Oh, sorry.

753
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,039
I came to the wrong place.

754
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:08,510
I thought it was the fourth floor.

755
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,010
My bad.

756
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,519
Sorry.

757
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:32,300
Come in and sit down.

758
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:35,969
Here goes.

759
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:37,969
Ta-da.

760
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,239
When did you learn that?

761
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,409
I'm a fast learner.

762
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,489
We should've toasted first.

763
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,820
I'm in no mood for that.

764
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:54,059
Goodness.

765
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,760
Jung Soo Yeon was here today.

766
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,530
The agent from About Sports.

767
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,940
What for?

768
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,400
To talk about money?

769
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,269
Did she want to sign a deal?

770
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:15,579
You and I both are no match for agents.

771
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,650
She didn't want to talk about money.

772
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,409
I'm here to talk about dreams.

773
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,050
Dreams?

774
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,719
Ms. Han's dream is to become champion
of all four boxing organizations?

775
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,289
I'll help her do that.

776
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:31,530
It's not official yet,

777
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,760
but Lee Gweon Suk's
preparing to fight in the US.

778
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:37,730
Her agent's meeting with certain people.

779
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:39,369
For this to happen,

780
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:43,340
she needs to win against Ms. Han
and secure the title of champion.

781
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,710
Who says that Ah Reum will fight her?

782
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,539
He can dream on.

783
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,750
I plan to use that against them.

784
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,679
Ms. Han beats Ms. Lee...

785
00:46:54,219 --> 00:46:57,250
and signs the US deal instead.

786
00:46:58,849 --> 00:46:59,989
What did you say?

787
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,289
What else? I said no.

788
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:05,389
Good for you.

789
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,400
What's this?

790
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:15,869
The complete data
on Lee Gweon Suk's skills and stats.

791
00:47:16,269 --> 00:47:17,269
What?

792
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,269
Kim Tae Young gave it to me.

793
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:20,980
Gweon Suk's agent.

794
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,210
They have more than enough info on you,

795
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:25,949
but we have nothing on them.

796
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,119
Gosh.

797
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:29,849
Seriously?

798
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,250
He's insane.

799
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,320
So what?

800
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,019
- Did you take a look?
- What?

801
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,360
Well... I almost did.

802
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,230
I didn't look.

803
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:46,099
Ah Reum.

804
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:50,440
I've thought about it
for the past couple of days.

805
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,909
If you're really not up for it,
it's best to pass.

806
00:47:53,909 --> 00:47:55,340
You might get some bad press,

807
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:59,110
but I can find you another opponent.

808
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:01,079
If we miss the deadline...

809
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:02,949
and lose the title, so be it.

810
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:04,619
We can start over.

811
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:06,219
Like we did three years ago.

812
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,090
I'm not sure about anyone else,

813
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:11,690
but you, Ah Reum,

814
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:13,730
can do it.

815
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:24,769
Deal?

816
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,840
Deal.

817
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,150
It tastes great.

818
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,789
Here, let's eat.

819
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,900
This is the best thing to eat
when you're drinking.

820
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,809
(Giant Boxing)

821
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:08,420
Let's see.
You reduced the time by 15 seconds.

822
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,619
Your breathing is level,

823
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,050
so you're getting fitter.

824
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,059
Your reflexes...

825
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,360
My goodness.

826
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,590
Faster than before.

827
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:19,260
Are you training to be a coach?

828
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,170
I think it would be a shame
to waste your title.

829
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,940
Hey, I saw Gweon Suk yesterday.

830
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,940
Lee Gweon Suk?

831
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,840
Where?

832
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,449
She was standing outside
when I was clocking off.

833
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,449
She was here to see you.

834
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:46,789
Aren't you curious?

835
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,070
Hey.

836
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:07,579
You won't ask what I came here to say?

837
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,110
Before I do,

838
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,210
you won't eat?

839
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:14,449
The food here's good.
Ah Reum and I are regulars.

840
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,389
Oh, I'm on a strict diet.

841
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,019
Oh, I'm so sorry.

842
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,489
This is a calorie minefield.

843
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,860
I don't mind.

844
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:30,599
I'll listen.

845
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,070
In Ah Reum's place.

846
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:38,070
Apologize to her for me...

847
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:40,980
for being rude along the way.

848
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,179
My agent's a bit...

849
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:46,079
like that.

850
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:49,019
I know. He's pretty famous.

851
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:51,150
I kind of get it.

852
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,690
I'm not sure about Ah Reum, though.

853
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:57,929
And...

854
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:01,900
If she doesn't want to fight me,

855
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:05,400
tell her that...

856
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,639
she doesn't have to do it.

857
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:10,809
I can't do that,

858
00:51:12,909 --> 00:51:14,510
but if Ah Reum...

859
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,010
isn't up for it,

860
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,480
I'd like her to follow her heart.

861
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,389
She was sweeter than I thought.

862
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,760
And cute too.

863
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:32,559
I'll pay for the tteokbokki.

864
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:35,829
What? Just like that?

865
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Yes.

866
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,110
Have this.

867
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,179
You gave in over a pot of tteokbokki?

868
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:53,010
You can tell a lot about a person from it.

869
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,320
She must've been so hesitant
to come all the way here.

Hello, Ms. Jung.

Why is everyone tiptoeing around me?

874
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:20,039
Do you think I'll throw a fit...

875
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:21,440
because I lost out on a promotion?

876
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:23,079
It's not that.

877
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,110
You have a visitor.

878
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:46,070
Should I not have come here?

879
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:48,639
Why say that?

880
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:50,510
I thought you were influential.

881
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:53,210
You lost out on a promotion?

882
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,440
You're a true champion.

883
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,510
You attack away from the ring too.

884
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:09,989
Why are you here?

885
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,889
To talk about dreams.

886
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:14,730
Dreams?

887
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,940
If I fight Lee Gweon Suk...

888
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,269
and beat her,

889
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,710
will that get you promoted?

890
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,949
If I beat Lee Gweon Suk...

891
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,420
and become champion
of all four boxing organizations.

Uncle.

895
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,590
Hello, Ye Jun.

00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:16,289
- Uncle.
- Hello.

897
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:28,039
I'll come over when I'm not as busy.

898
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:30,010
- Around the end of the month.
- Okay.

Call when you get there.

00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,579
Look after yourself and stay in touch.

903
00:54:40,449 --> 00:54:41,449
See you.

904

Dad.

905
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,420
Strikeout.

906
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:19,889
What? Sweetie.

907
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,699
Will you be okay without the headgear?

908
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:34,300
Since I'm teaching a total beginner,

909
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,400
I'll be fine without it.

910
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,670
What will you do
if you end up getting punched?

911
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,809
Gosh.

912
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:48,719
I won't throw a single punch.

913
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,250
Punch me once, and you win.

914
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:52,889
Just once?

915
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,829
Gosh. I know that I'm a total beginner,
but I'm a man, you see.

916
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,230
Are you sure you'll be okay?

917

Then the loser will grant
the winner's wish.

00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:06,429
Sure, let's do it.

920
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:17,610
Come on.
I can dodge that with my eyes closed.

921
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,289
Mind your shoulders.

922
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:30,730
I can see all your moves.

923
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,119
You've gotten much better.

924
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,289
You told me to get the basics right.

925
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:03,389
Come on. It takes everyone time
to get the hang of things.

926
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,030
But...

927
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:16,699
can I really tell you my wish?

931
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,519
How about...

932
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:41,800
we go on just ten dates?

933
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,969
Just ten dates?

934
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,900
Yes.

935
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:49,139
Serious dates.

936
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:52,769
Just ten dates.

937
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,050
Why ten?

938
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,090
Ten seems like a good number.

939
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:06,750
If we don't think it'll work out
after the ten dates,

940
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,420
then we'll call it quits.

941

I looked everywhere for you.

I couldn't reach you. I was worried.

946
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,849
I was going to give you a call.

947
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:41,019
Couldn't you wait a little?
Why did you come here?

948

I couldn't reach you,
so I was worried sick.

I had a lot going on, so I forgot.
