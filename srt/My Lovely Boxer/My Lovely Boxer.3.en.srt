2
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,660
Are you telling me
to deliberately lose a match?

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,059
Then would this misery be over?
Is that it?

4
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,460
Lose, then you'll find out.

5
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,559
You've never once lost.

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,899
What if it doesn't end even after I lose?

7
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,339
Then what will you do?

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,869
I...

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,579
I will end it for you.

10
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:44,679
You'll do something I couldn't do myself?

11
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,990
Who do you think you are? Mister.

12
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,289
Do you know me?

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,929
Do you know why I started boxing?

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,469
Do you know what I've been through?

15
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,140
Do you know why I had to hide?

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,409
You know nothing.

17
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,920
You know nothing about me.

18
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:20,019
You're right. I don't know.

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,689
I know nothing.

20
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,859
So help me find out.

21
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:28,760
How did you get into boxing?

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,260
What have you been through?

23
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,760
Why did you quit boxing?

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,200
Why have you been hiding?

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,900
Let me find out.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,870
Three months would do.

27
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,170
I want to learn more about you,
so give me three months to do just that.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,980
I'll learn. All of it.

29
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,819
Then let's run away together.

30
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,120
From the ring.

31
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,030
Trust me.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll make it happen, no matter what.

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,180
(Episode 3)

34
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,610
Here.

35
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,479
You can keep it. I don't need it back.

36
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,860
It's not used.

37
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,060
You saw me rip the paper seal just now.

38
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,060
Yes, I know.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,300
I have eyes too.

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,870
Why me?

41
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,180
Why me, of all people?

42
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:31,120
There are other boxers too.

43
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,449
Let's just say the timing worked out.

44
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,219
"Timing?"

45
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,789
I needed a boxer
who'd be willing to deliberately lose,

46
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,560
and you needed an opportunity
to leave boxing for good.

47
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,159
And we met...

48
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,270
at the perfect timing.

49
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,539
You're lying.

50
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,379
Fine. To tell you the truth,

51
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,610
I did consider other boxers too.

52
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,349
Although I ended up coming to you.

53
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:02,650
But why me?

54
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,050
Because you won't ask questions.

55
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,219
Look, even now.

56
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:10,289
You're not asking me why I need someone...

57
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:11,960
to deliberately lose the fight.

58
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,129
And you're not asking me for money
in return for losing the match.

59
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,930
See?

60
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,470
That's what you're after. Money.

61
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,709
Gosh, what are you doing?

62
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,110
You shouldn't catch a cold.

63
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,480
As of today, you're my precious boxer.

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,449
Stop! I told you to stop.

65
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,120
Why am I your "precious boxer?"

66
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,649
I haven't even signed a contract with you.

67
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:41,649
But you will.

68
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:46,560
Why do you keep talking so casually to me?
I'm offended.

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,660
You can talk casually too.

70
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,930
It's fine.
I don't care about such formalities.

71
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,060
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

72
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,699
I don't want people to think we're close.

73
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,079
I'll think about it.

74
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,110
You said you wanted me to lose the match.

75
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,319
I'll give it some thought.

76
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:25,829
If I give up,

77
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,829
do you think this misery will end?

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,829
Even if I leave you alone,
someone else will come.

79
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,800
If that person leaves,
someone else will show up.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,670
After that,
someone else will come for you.

81
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,970
Boxing is your fate.
You can never run away from it.

82
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,939
Where do you want to go?

83
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,009
I'll get you there.

84
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:42,649
Three months would do.

85
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,720

Hey, why join a stupid chatroom like that?

98
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,279
I need to do some digging on you too.

99
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,550
You want to work with me.

100
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,779
People are calling you
all sorts of names, by the way.

101
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,649
So what? What's your point?

102
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Can I...

103
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,060
really trust you?

104
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,399
Look at you getting all quiet.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,970
You're the one who found me in hiding.

106
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,269
And you made all kinds of threats too.

107
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:18,439
Hey, why are you so impatient? Goodness.

108
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,509
So just answer me.

109
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,350
Can I really trust you?

110
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,550
To you, this is just about money.
But to me,

111
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,319
it's about my life.

115
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,829
Why take responsibility
for what you didn't do?

116
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,529
Because I'm his agent.

117
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,509
Either pay us back or make the game happen
within three months.

118
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,509
But you'd better leave...

120
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,350

Okay.

Why is it taking so long to decide?

Didn't you say your life depended on this?

127

If you don't like that, forget it.

128

When will you give me an answer?

129
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,939
How would I know that?

130
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:28,250
Don't show up in front of me
until I contact you.

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,409
You should come by from time to time.

168
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,080
- Okay?
- Yes.

169
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,909
Gosh. Now that you're leaving,

170
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,980
I'm really sad.

171
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,019
Right.

172
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,460
Will you start boxing again?

173
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,690
No. I haven't made any decisions yet.

174
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,929
Gosh, why not?
Everyone said you were a gifted boxer.

175
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:34,700
You can't let your talent
go to waste like that. That'd be a pity.

176
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,970
Well, if you happen to go back
and end up with a boxing match,

177
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,409
call me.

178
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,179
Okay.

179
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,210
Mr. Han.

180
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,659
Is there anything you want to say?

181
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,090
If...

182
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,100
I come back here after three months,

183
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,700
will you take me back?

184
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,200
After three months?

185
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:11,169
Yes.

186
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,840
I can come back...

187
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,870
after three months.

188
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
I see.

189
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:21,909
Is this a work-related question?
Or is it a personal question?

190
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,820
Both...

191
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,889
if you don't mind.

192
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:33,059
Then...

193
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,289
I should answer it carefully.

194
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,929
Well,

195
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,700
to be honest,

196
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,570
boxing isn't exactly my kind of sport.

197
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,440
You get punched, throw punches, and bleed.

198
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:50,139
Boxing looks quite primitive. You know?

199
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,980
I don't mind having a colleague who boxes.

200
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,980
But I don't think I can date...

201
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,080
a woman who boxes.

202
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Well,

203
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:08,389
did that answer your question?

204
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,690
Yes.

205
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,929
I hope you're not upset.

206
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,860
No.

207
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,299
I feel bad for saying so.

208
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,940
But still. You should come by sometimes.

209
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,409
You know, to look at flowers.

210
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:25,009
Okay.

211
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,990
(Year 2017)

212
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,990
Do I...

213
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,860
just stand here?

214
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,500
I don't get to come to school that often.

215
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,169
("Youth Documentary:
Genius Boxer Lee Kwon Sook")

216
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:52,840
I come to school
when there's a break between matches.

217
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,240
("Youth Documentary:
Genius Boxer Lee Kwon Sook")

218
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,139
To me, the boxing gym is my school,

219
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,940
my home, and my playground.

220
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,950
Friends?

221
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,279
Well,

222
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,019
I rarely see other kids.

223
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,889
But even when we run into
each other in our classroom,

224
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,830
our conversation stops
after we say a few things to each other.

225
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,100
We don't have that much in common.

226
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:21,470
And our worlds are different too.

227
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,139
I trained her...

228
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,710
as if I would train an animal.

229
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:30,840
I told her only weak people lost...

230
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
and she couldn't lose.

231
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,179
Make a fist.

232
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,850
Unclench it.

233
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,250
Boxing is all about retaliation.

234
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:44,559
Let's say your opponent killed your puppy.

235
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,830
Then you must do the same
and kill her puppy.

236
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,889
No.

237
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,929
You should beat up its mother
until she's breathless.

238
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,980
Kwon Sook.

239
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:08,909
That's boxing.

240
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:14,149
Hold this.

241
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Hook.

242
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,789
Punch me.

243
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,389
Smash me!

244
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,629
If you can't kill me, you die.

245
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:32,340
Why didn't you go for it?

246
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,000
Why did you pause?

247
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,070
Don't you ever get angry?

248
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,370
Do you always give in?

249
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,049
Did you hurt your fists?

250
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,009
Why do you stop at that?

251
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,649
For fear you'll hurt me?

252
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,750
Would you rather hurt me
or get hurt yourself?

253
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,250
I asked a question. Answer me!

254
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,830
I don't want either to get hurt.

255
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,629
What? What did you say?

256
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:01,370
"Either?" Can you say that in the ring?

257
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,399
Then you can die.

258
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,970
If not me, it'll be you.

259
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,740
It only ends when one dies.

260
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,110
That's boxing.

261
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:13,940
Training...

262
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,750
It's what I do every day,
so it's not tiring at all.

263
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,250
(Lee Kwon Sook, Age 18, Team Korea boxer)

264
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,549
I must train hard
to win gold at the championship.

265
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,289
I really want to win the gold medal
and give it to my mom.

266
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,500
Stay sharp. Play!

267
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,269
Get back up.

268
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,600
Get up and come here!

269
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,440
Punch me with all you've got.

270
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,340
Am I your dad?

271
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,409
- No.
- Then what?

272
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:53,720
- Am I your coach?
- No.

273
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,789
Then what?

274
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,720
What am I?

275
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,490
- You're my enemy.
- So what, then?

276
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,230
And you punch me like that?

277
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,799
Listen up.

278
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,339
I just killed your dog.

279
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:16,809
Okay?

280
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,549
That's all for today.

281
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,579
Turn that off.

282
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:08,329
(The guy)

283
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:09,730
(Missed calls, Unread messages)

284
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,740
Ms. Lee. Lee Kwon Sook!

285
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,480
Are you in there?

286
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:28,009
Lee Kwon Sook! Ms. Lee!

287
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,849
What the heck?

288
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,400
What are you doing at my door?

289
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,329
You're so noisy.

290
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,069
Were you here all along?

291
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,500
Yes, why? Is there a problem?

292
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,509
I...

293
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,809
Do you know how many times I called?

294
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:59,640
I went to the kindergarten
and looked for you everywhere.

295
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,509
I was going to go to the cops
if I couldn't reach you today.

296
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:03,009
Did I ask you to look for me?

297
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,920
I told you to stay away until I called.

298
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,619
Where are you going?

299
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,829
Where are you going?

300
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:27,170
I'm low on sugar.

301
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,940
- What?
- My blood sugar is low.

302
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,809
It's all your fault.

303
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,279
There are reporters by the main road.

304
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,289
Follow me.

305
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,769
Each one has 247 calories.

306
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:56,970
Do you know that?

307
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,970
Do you know which donuts taste the best?

308
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,769
No.

309
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,509
The ones with the most calories.

310
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,039
They're all good.

311
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,579
Should an athlete eat like this?

312
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,319
Weight-watching
is really important for boxers.

313
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,519
I'm not a boxer.

314
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,130
You know,

315
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,460
I called you 43 times.

316
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:31,130
I actually thought
something had happened to you.

317
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,740
You created this whole situation.

318
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,609
I lost my job.

319
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:39,440
As if you're worried about me.

320
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,380
The lawsuit. I dropped it.

321
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:50,190
There's no point
in threatening you with that.

322
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,319
You act like you really care about me.

323
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:53,819
So,

324
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,160
have you given it some thought?

325
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,259
You said you'd think about it.

326
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,730
I won't do it.

327
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,940
If I put up with this
for about five years,

328
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,910
people will stop caring.

329
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,809
It's just five more years.

330
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,380
Why would I box again?

331
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,609
I hate that more than dying.

332
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:22,849
Don't drink that.

333
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,160
What's wrong with you?

334
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,130
Don't come between me and food.

335
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Mister.

336
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
What?

337
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,009
You called me, so talk. What?

338
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:52,019
I'll do it.

339
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:00,059
I'll box again.

340
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,430
You just said you wouldn't.
Why the sudden switch?

341
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,700
Shall I not, then?

342
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,940
Why the sad face, then?

343
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,619
Because I don't want to do it.

344
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,759
I hate boxing so much.

345
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,630
But if I run away again,

346
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,940
I don't think it'll ever come to an end.

347
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,869
However hard I try to run,

348
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,480
boxing will come after me until I die.

349
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,849
That terrifies me.

350
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,190
I'm scared.

351
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:37,990
A bit higher.

352
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,230
A bit lower.

353
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,799
Why does it look slanted?

354
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,329
Up or down, which way?

355
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,009
I think that'll do.

356
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,839
(Lee Kwon Sook, welcome to SP)

357
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:04,980
- Hello.
- Hi.

358
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,119
- I'm off to pick her up.
- Okay.

359
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,589
Kim.

360
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,960
Make it very clear
that she'll only take...

361
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,589
the fight money with no signing bonus.

362
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,930
Don't let her change her mind
before she signs the form.

363
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:20,960
Our rivals are all waiting
for our deal to fall through.

364
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:23,400
She will just take the fight money,

365
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,500
and she doesn't want too much.

366
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,269
Good luck.

367
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,740
Thanks.

368
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,559
Isn't it a nice day?

369
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:52,059
Lots of people would love to see you.

370
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,430
I've already sent three people packing.

371
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,930
From right here.

372
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,710
(Team Manager Jung Soo Yeon)

373
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,079
If you're here because of my comeback...

374
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,980
I've already made my decision.

375
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,750
I know you've been in contact
with S and P.

376
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,519
Since you always fought
as an amateur boxer,

377
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,019
I bet you don't know what it's like
for pro boxers.

378
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,329
Do you know how much
professional boxers make in a year?

379
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:26,430
I'm not sure.

380
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,960
I'd say it's around
3,000 to 4,000 dollars.

381
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:30,799
For the Korean National Championships,

382
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,670
it ranges from 100
to 1,000 dollars per match.

383
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:37,240
And you have to do a 70-30 split
with your coach.

384
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,809
You'd have to win
the Asian Championship...

385
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:40,809
to bump it up severalfold.

386
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:43,950
Han Ah Reum,
even with her World Champion title,

387
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,380
is in a similar situation.

388
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,549
Thank you.

389
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:49,619
Let's do a good job.

390
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:52,289
A champion must have a mandatory
defense match every six months.

391
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,859
Each match costs...

392
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:56,990
- about 100,000 dollars.
- I'll take it now.

393
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,130
- One, two, three.
- As a rule, the champion...

394
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,460
- Stand closer.
- must take care of all the expenses.

395
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,670
Shall we shout "Let's go" together?

396
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,670
- Sure.
- Sure.

397
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,170
- Han Ah Reum must've shed many tears...
- Let's go!

398
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,410
while trying to keep her champion belt
for the past few years.

399
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,579
We're ready to order.

400
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:14,579
Sure.

401
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,920
I must say,
Ah Reum has it easier than the others.

402
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,549
For all the pro boxers in this country,
having to keep side jobs...

403
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,859
- I'll serve this to Table Five!
- is a given.

404
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:33,000
Why are you telling me all this?

405
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,160
Because you...

406
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:36,700
can change it.

407
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,839
That's nonsense.

408
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,140
How could I do something like that?

409
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,180
Do you remember
the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight?

410
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:50,950
The cheapest ticket for that match...

411
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,119
cost 3,800 dollars.

412
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,750
But...

413
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:57,849
the tickets all sold out
in just one minute.

414
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:01,119
The fight money surpassed
400 million dollars,

415
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,230
for both fighters combined.

416
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:05,529
We need a star player
to keep boxing alive.

417
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,470
That's why I'm here.

418
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,069
I want to make you...

419
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:15,910
the Mayweather of Korea.

420
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:34,460
Gosh, seriously.

421
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,660
(Lee Kwon Sook)

422
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,960
(I'm on my way now.)

423
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,470
(Where on earth...)

424
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,509
I'm sorry,

425
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,079
but I don't think I can do it.

426
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,890
I know you came all the way here
to see me,

427
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,990
but I don't have what it takes to do that.

428
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,190
Would you please help me?

429
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:14,000
Korean boxing needs you, Kwon Sook.

430
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,470
I...

431
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,000
don't even deserve to talk about boxing.

432
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,109
I'm sorry. I have to go.

433
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,710
By any chance,

434
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,549
did he ask you where you wanted to go?

435
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,450
Didn't Mr. Kim Tae Young...

436
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,220
tell you he would take you
to the place you wanted to go?

437
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,890
I will take you there.
To the place you want to go.

438
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,930
That's what he does.

439
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,170
He has the athletes under his thumb.

440
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,000
And he does whatever he wants
to do with them.

441
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:56,569
He did that to me too.

442
00:28:58,509 --> 00:28:59,680
Mr. Kim was...

443
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,250
my agent in the past.

444
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Ms. Lee.

445
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,160
Ms. Lee!

446
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:23,000
(Lee Kwon Sook)

447
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,109
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

448
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
Darn it.

449
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,559
Hey!

450
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,630
Oh!

451
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:50,390
Mister, you're late.

452
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,359
Meet me in the parking lot.

453
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:08,240
Why did you turn your phone off?

454
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,980
My battery was running low.

455
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,119
Why are you yelling at me?
I ran all the way here.

456
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:17,420
Hey, you should've charged your phone.

457
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,319
Why can't you be more prepared?

458
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,960
Look who's talking.
Why couldn't you trust me?

459
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,460
That look on your face in the car...

460
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,630
I told you I'd come.

461
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,460
It's not that I don't trust you.

462
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,200
I was just worried.

463
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,170
Worried, my foot.

464
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:34,569
You were totally antsy.

465
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:39,539
Do you really think
I'd get antsy about stuff like this?

466
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:40,740
You were antsy.

467
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,740
No, I wasn't.

468
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,009
Wimp.

469
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:44,549
Stop, will you?

470
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,720
- Mister.
- Why? What?

471
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:57,859
Can you unlock the door for me?

472
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Oh, right.

473
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,599
I, Lee Kwon Sook,
will be sure to lose and retire!

474
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,609
Shall I set up a billboard for you
in front of Gangnam Station?

475
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,779
Mister.

476
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,079
Why do you keep calling me? What is it?

477
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,109
You should thank my mom.

478
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,750
My mom told me that...

479
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,750
when I wanted something with all my heart,

480
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,650
the universe would send me someone
who'd help me achieve it.

481
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,119
I'm going to put my trust in you.

482
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,230
But if you betray me,
you'll die at my hands.

483
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,950
Please sign here.

484
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,950
(Lee Kwon Sook)

485
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,950
I look forward to working with you.

486
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,400
Smile. One, two.

487
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,670
Go, Lee Kwon Sook!

488
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,240
(Park Kyung Soo, See Results)

489
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,980
- Oh.
- Here we go.

490
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,109
- Keep going.
- Oh, no.

491
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,150
Let's go!

492
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:28,519
- Nice!
- It's Reporter Park!

493
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,220
- Nice!
- Great.

494
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,619
Since it's on Reporter Park,

495
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:32,920
let's have ginseng chicken soup. Okay?

496
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,390
Come on. We should have
the Hanwoo beef set for lunch.

497
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,660

Lee Kwon Sook has signed her contract.

500
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:47,240
We'll distribute the press release
in 21 hours.

501
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
What are you doing? Let's go.

Oh, I'll meet you guys there.

503
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,609
Goodness. He's at it again.

504
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:56,680
You're really something!

505
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:58,980

- What do you feel like?
- I want sundaeguk.

511
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,289
Oh, the sundaeguk restaurant is...

512
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:14,130
Then I'll have tripe soup.

513
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,799
Let's go.

514

So?

Did the two of you
manage to get to the place...

you'd wanted to go?

It makes me angry to say this,

but yes. We did.

He's a jerk, but he keeps his promises.

Then it's fine.

525
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,950
I don't know what he promised you.

526
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,019
But I'm a good agent too.

Will you give me a chance
to show you that?

No.

I'm sorry to say this,

for this house
until your second match is over.

546

You didn't tell me I had to move.

547
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:52,119
You said people still came here
to see you every day.

548

The building supervisor said
it was a hassle...

to deal with residents, making complaints
all because of you.

550

It's because of you, not me.

551
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,630
Anyway, you can't stay here.

552

There's no security here,
and it's far from the gym too.

Hey.

Don't look.

557
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,679
I'm sorry.

558
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,750
So where are we going?

559
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,949
My house.

560
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,489
Your house?

561
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:30,789
Are you telling me to stay here?

562
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,260
It doesn't matter where you stay.

563
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,929
You said you didn't want
to run into people.

564
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:36,530
Staying at hotels can be risky too.
Stay here for the time being.

565
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:38,030
With you?

566
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,000
Are you crazy?

567
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,170
I don't want to stay with you either.
It's uncomfortable for me too.

568
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,809
I'll stay at my junior's house.
Don't worry.

569
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:51,480
This is the guest room.

570
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,980
Let me know if you need anything.

571
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,320
I have storage here.

572
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,750
You'll find everything you need there...

573
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,139
Mr. Kim was my agent in the past.

574
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:24,809
They are the athletes I used to manage.

575

I'm going to plan your diet
starting tomorrow.

Before your comeback match,

577
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:34,920
you must lose at least 6kg.

578
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,059
Ask me before you eat anything
including water.

579
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:37,989
No need to scare me. I know the drill.

580
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,960
Gosh, I hate dieting.

581
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,530
Send me your bank account number
so I can pay the rent.

582
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,369
When did I ask you to pay rent?

583
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:49,710
I have money.

584
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,369
- I get pension.
- I never said you didn't have money.

585
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,210
Why are you wasting your pension?

586
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,750
It's my money. I'll spend it
however I see fit. Why are you meddling?

587
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:57,409
Pensions are different from regular money.

588
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,380
You should spend it
on something more valuable.

589
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,079
There's some money
I'd rather spend on useless things.

590
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:05,860
To me, pension is a symbol of my trauma.

591
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:07,820
Are you a teenager?

592
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,929
Do you know
how immature you sound right now?

593
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:11,590
If you don't take it, I'll move out.

594
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,059
That's it.

595
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,300
I told you...

596
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,070
All right. Do the steps.

597
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,739
One, two. Let's go.

598
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:29,880
One, two. Down and hook.

599
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,750
One, two. Down and hook.

600
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,019
One, two. Down and hook.

601
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:37,289
Let's do that three more times.

602
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,590
Down and hook.

603
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,260
- One, two. Down and hook.
- One, two. Down and hook.

604
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:46,329
One last time. One, two. Down and hook.

605
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,760
Gosh. Good work.

606
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:50,500
- Good work.
- Bye.

607
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,840
- Thank you.
- That was a good workout.

608
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,340
- Thank you.
- You saw our new schedule, right?

609
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,010
- Yes. Thank you.
- Let's go.

610
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:58,909
Hey, Tae Young.

611
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:05,449
Gosh. It's nice to meet you.

612
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,380
What do you think about the gym?
Do you like it?

613
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,190
Yes. Well,

614
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,150
it looks like this place is...

615
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,820
for unenthusiastic quitters, so I like it.

616
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:14,619
It doesn't smell like sweat either.

617
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,460
Right?

618
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,030
People these days love working out
at places like this.

619
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,130
(Let's get pretty. You trust me, right?)

620
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,260
Where's the coach?

621
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,400
(You're the prettiest
when you throw punches.)

622
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:26,000
That would be me.

623
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,940
Forget about the formalities.

624
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,610
Coach or whatnot.

625
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,139
My students here usually call me...

626
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,809
"my dear."

627
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:40,820
I see. Okay.

628
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:42,050
His name is Choi Ho Joong.

629
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,619
The former lightweight champion in Asia.

630
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:46,519
He'll be your training partner.

631
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,920
I look forward to working with you.

632
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,030
Sure.

633
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:58,199
As for the equipment here,
it's in the best condition.

634
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:00,599
Besides,
I'm a bit of an equipment enthusiast.

635
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,769
You can use this gym
from morning until night.

636
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,780
From 9 a.m. until 2 p.m.,

637
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,639
you'll have the gym to yourself
for these five hours.

638
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,280
Reporters will come
and watch you train in a few days.

639
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,650
So get ready with Ho Joong.

640
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,880
The public will watch?

641
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:14,449
It's nothing more than...

642
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:17,320
just an event. So relax.

643
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,590
Do I have to do that?

644
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,519
You're no longer an amateur.
You're a professional boxer now.

645
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,190
You must be a good boxer
who can also communicate with the public.

646
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,030
- Get her ready.
- Okay.

647
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,630
I hate doing stuff in front of reporters.

648
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,199
Come on, mister.

649
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:36,969
You can't leave until 2 p.m.

650
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,809
I cleared the morning classes here
for you.

651
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,110
If you want to leave,
you have to beat me first.

652
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:50,150
You must not have learned this yet.

653
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,420
You're a boxer.
If you go around throwing punches...

654
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,860
Great.

655
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,059
Faster. Come on.

656
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:52,719
Hey, hold on.

657
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,030
Sook.

658
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,030
Enough with the evasion drill.
Let's hit the sandbag for ten minutes.

659
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,300
Gosh, come on.
I told you to stop calling me Sook.

660
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:14,170
What's wrong with you?

661
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:24,849
Hey, why do you call her Sook?

662
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,079
She already hates her name.

663
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:29,150
It's cute that she gets so irritated.

664
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,059
When did you two drop the honorifics?

665
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:34,719
Us?

666
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,889
We did that almost immediately.

667
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,530
I guess you haven't yet.

668
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,469
She said she didn't want us
to look friendly.

669
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:45,940
Hey, check that out.

670
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,210
Kwon Sook is in great shape.
Too great, if you ask me.

671
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,409
- Is that so?
- She's got good muscles.

672
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:57,579
Endurance, flexibility, agility,
and dynamic visual acuity.

673
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:59,679
She's at the top,
even among the current boxers.

674
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:03,150
(Your age of cardiovascular health
and lung capacity, 20 years old)

675
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:05,989
- Tae Young.
- Yes.

676
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:07,789
Do you have to...

677
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:10,730
rig the game?

678
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,429
Why do you ask?

679
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,869
She took a long break.

680
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:19,300
I thought it would take a long time
to rebuild her body.

681
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,639
But that's not the case at all.

682
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:22,670
Do you see this?

683
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,840
It looked like she didn't even try
that hard, but that was a mean punch.

684
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,019
What's the point?

685
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,449
She despises boxing.

686
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
She said she was cursed by her father.

687
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,690
You mean Lee Chul Yong?

688
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,429
Gosh. What a waste of talent.

689
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:51,130
Don't you even mention his name to her.

690
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,239
Why? I have so much respect for the guy.

691
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,539
She hates her father
as much as she hates boxing.

692
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:58,710
You'll just ruin her comeback match.

693
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,880
Okay.

694
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,610
But who's going to fight her
in the first round?

695
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,449
Shall I list up some boxers?

696
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:07,920
No, don't bother.

697
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,090
I've decided.

698
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,650
Who is it?

699
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,260
That's it!

700
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:17,489
Don't shy away!

701
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:21,760
Jo A Ra, aged 27.

702
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,230
As a pro, she has six wins,
one loss, with six KO victories.

703
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:27,469
Stop.

704
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:28,599
Start over. Fight.

705
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:30,409
That's it.

706
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
Stop.

707
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,849
That's enough!

708
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,320
What's she doing? Why won't she stop?

709
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,050
Her only loss was due to a penalty foul.

710
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,619
The opponent who won that match
retired due to her injuries.

711
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:57,469
Away from the ring,
she's an ordinary woman in her 20s.

712
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,809
In the ring, she's a mad attention-seeker.

713
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:19,519
Her fandom is the craziest and weirdest.

714
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,030
She's a master of media manipulation.

715
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,699
She uploads an average
of 13 photos and videos a day.

716
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:31,699
That's how addicted
to social media she is.

717
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,579
(Jo A Ra)

718
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,579
Gosh.

719
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:46,920
Save me.

720
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,150
Tae Young.

721
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,159
She's not an athlete.
She's more like a performer.

722
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:55,690
She acts like a lunatic.

723
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,230
She earns money with the attention
she gets, not with the boxing matches.

724
00:45:58,889 --> 00:45:59,900
What about it?

725
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,030
That's how she became...

726
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,500
the second-most famous boxer
after Lee Kwon Sook.

727
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,230
Not everyone knows champion Han Ah Reum,

728
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:06,900
but they all know Jo A Ra.

729
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:09,139
She has pretty good skills,

730
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,239
and she has never lost a match.

731
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,239
She did lose one.

732
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:15,679
By a penalty foul.

733
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,880
She's the best first opponent.

734
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,550
She has a strong fandom,

735
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:21,380
and she can control the media.

736
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:24,719
She'll do our work for us
and promote the match.

737
00:46:26,389 --> 00:46:27,989
Do you think boxing's a show?

738
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:31,989
We must make it a show.

739
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,260
That sells tickets,

740
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,130
and sold tickets make us money.

741
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:38,269
You focus on winning the match.

742
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,940
Jo A Ra's no pushover.

743
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,539
She doesn't have a title
but she's Asia's bantamweight number four.

744
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,380
She's a strong southpaw.

745
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:53,820
Three years ago, maybe,

746
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:55,679
but she'll be hard to beat now.

747
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,360
Take this.

748
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:03,860
Thank you.

749
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,840
If any of the reporters have a question.

750
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,079
Yes, you.

751
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:33,349
I believe you changed your legal name.

752
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,820
Is there a reason
you changed it to Lee Yu Ri?

753
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,920
I believe...

754
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,619
it's boxer Lee Kwon Sook
that the fans want to see.

755
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:43,260
Now that I'm back,

756
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,860
I'd like you to call me Lee Kwon Sook.

757
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:51,329
Will you have any problems
with the weigh-in?

758
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,900
You were away for quite a while.

759
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,269
It won't be easy
to lose the extra weight to compete...

760
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,909
in your usual bantamweight category.

761
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,780
That's not an issue.

762
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:06,179
Ms. Lee's currently training with me,
a weight loss expert...

763
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,920
at Emperor Diet Boxing.

764
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:16,730
Ms. Lee's current weight is 59.64kg.

765
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:23,130
That's 6kg above
the bantamweight limit of 53.52kg.

766
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:25,369
She just has to lose six kilos.

767
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,440
Mister.

768
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:33,610
What?

769
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:40,820
Any other questions?

(Lee Kwon Sook fails bantamweight.)

774

I don't weigh 60kg.

775
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,309
I weigh 59.64kg!

776
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:54,860
Did you have breakfast?

777
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,230
Why ask?

778
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,760
Oh, do you want to know
how I put on weight?

779
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,539
What's up with her?
Why won't she let me talk to her?

(Emperor Diet Boxing)

Please wait for your order.

782
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:22,119
Are you ready to order?

783
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,949
I'll have an iced latte.

784
00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:27,960
With two shots and this much milk.

785
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:31,059
An iced latte
with two shots and a dash of milk.

786
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,860
No, wait.

787
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,630
What's the drip of the day?

788
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:39,429
The drip of the day is Yirgacheffe.

789
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:41,340
It's lightly acidic...

790
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,070
with a flowery, fruity aroma.

791
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:47,480
Just give me a hot black coffee.

792
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,980
A tall one.

793
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,710
One hot black coffee.

794
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:56,789
Four dollars and ten cents.

795
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:00,860
You can't...

796
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,389
I bet you want to smack me.

797
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:07,429
I'll arrange a match. Call me.

00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,179
You never cared for sports.

The algorithm keeps recommending clips.

Do you want something to drink?

803

No. I can't stay for long.

804
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,800
I'm here to say something.

805

You want to talk? What about?

806
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,530

Are you proposing to me right now?

809
00:52:57,409 --> 00:52:58,809
What kind of reaction is this?

810
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,050
I want to marry someone else, not you.

811

Are you surprised?

00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:07,860
No.

But why him and not me?

814
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,929
Come on. Don't be clingy.

815
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,059
We were like key rings to each other.

816
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,070
- A key ring?
- Yes.

817
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:20,539
Someone who looks nice by my side.

818

Someone I can take profile pictures with.

819
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,110
Nothing more than that.

820
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:28,309
My friends told me to choose
a diligent man with a promising future.

821
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,210
You were never serious about me anyway.

00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:33,349
And about your career too.

823
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:34,980
Am I wrong?

824
00:53:41,489 --> 00:53:42,989
Get it together already.

825
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:45,159
You're 30 now.

826
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:48,400
How much longer will you rely
on your mother financially?

827
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:55,599
- Oh, my.
- My gosh. She's amazing.

828
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,210
- Did you see that?
- Yes, she's so fast.

829
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:59,840
- I didn't know she was so cool.
- My gosh. Right?

830
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,639
- She's really cool.
- Yes, look at that.

831
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:02,739
Her moves are so fast
that you can't see them.

832
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:05,610
You don't need to turn it off.
Keep watching.

833
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,619
Who moved my desk?

834
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,860
I moved it
because the director told me to.

835
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:24,400
You moved it?

836
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:27,340
How could you get rid of my desk
without even telling me?

837
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,469
I had no choice but to do it
because the director told me to.

838
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:31,010
I have no power, you see.

839
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:33,269
You should've at least called me.

840
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:35,409
You rarely answer our calls.

841
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,809
We moved it two days ago,

842
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,579
and you found out just now.

843
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,659
Okay, so where is my desk?

844
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:03,070
Gosh, it's so heavy.

845
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:05,610
- Mr. Han!
- Mr. Han!

846
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,139
You can't even carry this?

847
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,550
Ms. Yu Ri moved that totem pole
all by herself.

848
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:14,420
By herself?

849
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,019
No way.

850
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:17,820
Who can move that thing by themselves?

851
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,920
I'm telling you the truth!

852
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,789
She lifted it effortlessly
and moved it by herself.

853
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:21,960
I saw it!

854
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,130
Yes, I think I saw it too.

855
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,159
- I saw it too!
- Me too!

856
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:29,760
Okay, I heard you. Stop.

857
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:34,400
Hey, you can't go on it. Get down.

858
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:36,869
Hey, don't do that. Come here. Get down.

859
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:39,409
Don't!

860
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,199
So? Have you given it some thought?

861
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:03,929
A match with Lee Kwon Sook.
All eyes will be on it.

862
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,000
It'll be a great opportunity for you.

863
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,699
"Opportunity?" Oh, please.

864
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:09,139
Where will the fight take place?

865
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,869
- Is it a big place?
- A municipal stadium with 500 seats.

866
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:13,980
That's small.

867
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:17,510
I won't do it if I have to be there
as male boxers' sidekick.

868
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:18,710
It'll be the main event.

869
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:22,280
- Which TV network?
- I can't guarantee you any TV exposure.

870
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:24,349
But it'll be live-streamed.

871
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,219
So even Lee Kwon Sook
couldn't sell the right to broadcast it.

872
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:33,559
How much will you pay me?

873
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:35,699
How much is Lee Kwon Sook getting?

874
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,599
You'll be surprised to hear it
as it's very small.

875
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,469
She said a large amount
would make her uncomfortable,

876
00:56:40,469 --> 00:56:42,269
so we're giving her the bare minimum.

877
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:46,469
She must be very comfortable financially.

878
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:48,340
She turned down money?

879
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,679
How much would you like?

880
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,380
I want 100,000 dollars.

881
00:56:55,949 --> 00:56:57,820
- Why did you scoff?
- Will you do it for 100,000 dollars?

882
00:57:00,389 --> 00:57:01,460
No.

883
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,829
Lee Kwon Sook is a hot potato
at the moment.

884
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,559
If I fight with her,
the others will call me a traitor too.

885
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,599
Sorry, honey.

886
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,210
Now, I can eat, right?

887
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:55,739
Who are you? Who sent you?

888
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,150
Hey, are you Kim Tae Young?

889
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:08,159
Are you Lee Chul Yong?

890
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,400
When did you start tailing me?

891
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,860
That's what you want to know?

892
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,769
If you were that curious
about what your daughter was up to,

893
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:20,130
why didn't you call me?

894
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,900
I can't believe you punched me.

895
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:23,099
What are you, a thug?

896
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,369
Why you little...

897
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:28,079
Hey. You're that infamous son of a witch.

898
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,210
How did you sweet-talk my daughter
into doing this?

899
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,449
Do you have something on her?
Did you threaten her or something?

900
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:35,719
If I did, then what?
What can you even do now?

901
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,920
You piece of...

902
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,389
Gosh! Stop, okay?

903
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,489
Your daughter made the decision
of her own accord.

904
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,230
To get closure
on what happened three years ago.

905
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:55,940
Hey. If you're her agent,

906
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:58,039
why are you two so close?

907
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:01,579
You little... Are you trying
to make a move on my daughter?

908
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:04,349
Gosh, seriously!
No, I do not have any feelings for her.

909
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,880
Fine.

910
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,150
Hand over your phone.

911
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:11,619
Why?

912
00:59:12,889 --> 00:59:14,590
(Lee Chul Yong)

913
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:16,789
If anything happens,

914
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,789
call me right away.

915
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,829
Answer me.

916
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,900
Okay! I heard you.

917
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,070
Good grief. I will call you.

918
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,239
Don't even tell Kwon Sook that you met me.

919
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:33,070
You got that?

920
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:40,579
There will come a time
when Kwon Sook suddenly changes...

921
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,519
as if she's dying or something.

922
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:46,449
For example, that rebel
would suddenly become obedient.

923
00:59:47,019 --> 00:59:49,360
Or she'd suddenly stop whining
and become all quiet.

924
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:50,789
That's a sign...

925
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,260
that she doesn't want to box.

926
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,329
Don't stop her, and just let her go.

927
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:00,130
What if I stop her?

928
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,409
Then I...

929
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,239
won't let you off.

930
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,090
You can try throwing longer punches.

931
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,590
All right. Let's take a quick break.

932
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,199
(Assistant Director Han Jae Min)

933
01:00:41,539 --> 01:00:42,639
Hello?

934
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,710
Gosh, thank goodness you picked up.

935
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:46,679
What are you up to now?

936
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,050
Now?

937
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,190
I was just practicing.

938
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,519
Oh, you had to practice.

939
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,090
Yes. What's up?

940
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,389
Do you have some time now?

941
01:00:58,389 --> 01:00:59,590
Five minutes would do.

942
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:00,630
Five minutes?

943
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,369
Yes, that should be fine.

944
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,929
Really? Then look out the window.

945
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,000
The window?

946
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:26,550
Come out for a moment.

947
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:33,690
My gosh.

948
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,800
(Emperor Diet Boxing)

949
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,599
What brings you here?

950
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,539
You should've called me in advance.

951
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:45,239
Then you wouldn't have let me come here.

952
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,539
I asked Eun Sol for your address.

953
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:50,309
I came to give you this.

954
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:02,489
I'm covered in sweat
as I've been practicing.

955
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:04,960
You're worried you'd stink?

956
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:06,889
Come on. Who cares?

957
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,840
Oh, one moment.

958
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,480
What is this?

959
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,119
What do you think?
Clearly, I've come here to apologize.

960
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:32,449
I said to you that boxing was lame.

961
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:36,119
I wanted to apologize for that.
I bet it's obvious.

962
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:39,960
Okay.

963
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,599
But this won't do.

964
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:48,769
Well,

965
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,340
then...

966
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,670
do you want to punch me?

967
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:55,079
What?

968
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,349
(Emperor Diet Boxing)

969
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:02,179
I watched the video today.

970
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,949
Your training video.

971
01:03:03,949 --> 01:03:06,590
I see. That...

972
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:10,090
After watching that video,
I watched videos of all of your fights.

973
01:03:10,659 --> 01:03:12,860
I enjoyed watching them.

974
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:16,960
I was so clueless.

975
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:20,030
And I realized that
what I said to you was so hurtful.

976
01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:22,800
So I came here to apologize.

977
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,440
I see.

978
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:26,369
Okay.

979
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:37,750
Gosh, my phone.

980
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,920
It's so not helpful.

981
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:42,619
I set the timer for five minutes.

982
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:44,889
I can't distract you from your training.

983
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,860
My five minutes are up.
So I'll get going now.

984
01:03:49,929 --> 01:03:52,099
I might be back. When I do,

985
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:53,500
spare me five minutes again.

986
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:56,300
I'll set the timer again. Okay?

987
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:57,869
Okay.

988
01:04:09,949 --> 01:04:11,019
(Emperor Diet Boxing)

989
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,860
What are you doing over there?

990
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:40,550
(My Lovely Boxer)

991
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,940
What I want to do isn't boxing.
I want to date!

992
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:06,570
That's what you want? Dating?

993
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,139
You might think it's silly.

994
01:05:08,139 --> 01:05:09,780
Romance is important to me.

995
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,949
Why must I be on friendly terms with you?

996
01:05:12,949 --> 01:05:15,679
That way,
I can save face with the chairman.

997
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:16,880
Kwon Sook's next match.

998
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:18,550
Who's her opponent?

999
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:20,320
How about Ms. Han Ah Reum?

1000
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,530
I have no intention
of being part of the rigged game.

1001
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:25,559
I see.

1002
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,360
Do you know the definition of paradox?

1003
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,630
- Have you gone mad? What are you doing?
- I...

1004
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:31,429
put my life on the line for this game.

1005
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:33,769
I can't ruin my life
because of your love life.

1006
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:35,940
You're trying to put
the nationally beloved genius boxer...

1007
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:38,309
in a rigged game and make her retire.

1008
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,269
- What are you doing?
- Comforting you.

1009
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:42,010
That's paradoxical.

1010
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:45,610
- Lee Kwon Sook!
- Kwon Sook will show up, right?

1011
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:49,050
- Lee Kwon Sook!
- Shouldn't we call the police?
