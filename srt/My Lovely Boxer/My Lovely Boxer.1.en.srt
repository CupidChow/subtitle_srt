00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,580
(WBA World Championship Match,
Yuh Myung Woo)

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,910
(Yuh Myung Woo, fought 39 times
with 38 wins and a single loss)

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,980
(Inducted into the International Boxing
Hall of Fame in 2013)

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,380
She was a brilliant player.

5
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:13,550
Will we have a chance to see someone
as good as her in Korea?

6
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:17,320
Her punches are clean and powerful.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,730
After just one punch,
her opponents want to run away.

8
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:23,760
We can tell
because we've fought in the ring too.

9
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:27,370
The fact that we can see it in Korea,
right before our eyes.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,269
That is a blessing, in and of itself.

11
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:31,940
When will we have the opportunity
for such an experience?

12
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,810
It felt as if
the stadium was going to explode.

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,109
I was in the stadium that day.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,740
It was an incredible fight.

15
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,880
It was the best fight I had ever watched.

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,750
The best boxer after Muhammad Ali.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,750
Estomata.

18

(Fight with Estomata)

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,700
The living legend.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,900
The strongest man on Earth!

21

Estomata!

22

Everyone, make some noise!

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,980
This undefeated boxer...

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,390
had an unforgettable fight in Korea...

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,349
where boxing was unpopular.

26
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,790
Here's the main event of the day.

27
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,659
Fight with Estomata!

28
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,260
A focused sparring session!

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,260
Fight!

30
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,709
- Let's go!
- Go for it!

31

You got this!

32
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:29,550
All right. Here's the next participant.

33
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,259
It's a female student.

34
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,400
She's the only female participant today.

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,569
Is there anything
you would like to say to Estomata?

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,469
Can I punch you for real?

37
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,469
(Fight with Estomata)

38
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,580
Yes, of course.

39
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,310
What is your name?

40
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,610
My name is...

41
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,849

Get ready to rumble.

45
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:06,259
Fight!

Come on, lady.

47
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,509
- You got this!
- Let's go!

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
She's good.

49

Hey, can you look over here!

00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,209
- Over here!

55
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,740
- Come on!

56

She will go after the gold medal
at the Championships.

70
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,120
How's the training going?

71
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
Are you confident?

72

There's nothing special.

73

I've been doing so far...

she will win the gold medal.

The world gave unilateral love
to the genius.

Ms. Lee Kwon Sook,
have you come up with your next goal?

100
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:31,500
Ms. Lee Kwon Sook's next goal is...

101
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
to become the champion.

102
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,769
She'll go after the world champion title.

What's your training plan?

107
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,980
Does it mean you will debut
as a professional boxer?

Who will be your first opponent?

109
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,149
When's your debut match?

110
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,680
And they couldn't care less
about what she wanted.

111
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:53,920
Has it been decided?

112

Why am I dressed up as a chili pepper?

120

Why didn't you put me in my uniform?

121
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,379
It was probably done to emphasize
the spicy flavor of the food.

Kim,

128
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,600
the sales of boxed meals these days
are off the charts.

129
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,970
Boxed meals are very trendy.

130
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,269
That's right.

131

Do you think
you'll always be in the field?

132

What did you say?

133
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,410
I got you a deal with the royalties
from the boxed meals...

134

- Lee Kwon Sook.

164
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,110
The Korean female boxer
with the gold medal.

165
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,610
No.

166
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,580
Hey, Kim. Let's talk.

167
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:48,860
Come on, she's great.

168
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,330
She made a glorious debut...

169
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,259
in the boxing scene,
the wasteland of sports.

170
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,600
She won the Asian Games,

171
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,629
the World Tournament,
and the Championships.

172
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,970
She ruled these three major competitions
back to back...

173
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,179
Gosh, it was crazy back then.
Don't you remember?

174
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,980
Everyone on TV was talking about her.

175
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,850
There were so many kids at boxing gyms.

176
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,480
She was like the idol star of boxing.

177
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,320
The queen of golf, Pak Se Ri.

178
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,889
The figure skating queen, Kim Yuna.

179
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
And...

180
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,590
Lee Kwon Sook.

181
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,330
In my opinion,
Lee Kwon Sook will be a megastar...

182
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,529
who will follow in
Pak Se Ri's and Kim Yuna's footsteps.

183
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,539
Seriously.

184
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,909
She retired.

185
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,309
You heartless man.

186
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,250
She didn't retire.

187
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,909
She went into hiding.

188
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:44,980
(WBC Women's Bantamweight
Title Match Signing Ceremony)

189
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,919
(3 years ago)

190
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,419
(Lee Kwon Sook Versus Han Ah Reum)

191
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,159
What time is it?

192
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,389
What's the time?

193
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,470
I must share some unfortunate news.

194
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,840
We can't seem to reach
Lee Kwon Sook's team.

195
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,840
We must call off today's signing ceremony.

196
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,009
Was there an accident?

197
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,110
Were there no hints?

198
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,809
Is the title match off as well?

199
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,350
Han Ah Reum
doesn't have much time left to defend.

200
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,289
Doesn't she lose the title automatically
if she goes over the deadline?

201
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:24,919
(Han Ah Reum and Team)

202
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:28,429
I'll keep the championship belt,
whatever the cost.

203
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,230
How will you do that?

204
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,629
(WBC Women's Bantamweight
Title Match Signing Ceremony)

205
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:35,970
(What a nuisance.)

206
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,200
(Lee Kwon Sook will go down as a legend.)

207
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,870
That's retirement.

208
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,440
That's going into hiding.

209
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,639
What retiring athlete
doesn't have a retirement ceremony?

210
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,879
Going into hiding means retiring.

211
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,580
We agreed to call that a retirement.

212
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,750
It's a social agreement.

213
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,120
Why waste a busy man's time with this?

214
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,950
Hey, Kim!

215
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,220
That punk, you can't just...

216
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,889
My gosh. That jerk...

217
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,360
He has no manners.

218
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,870
Mr. Kim.

219
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,250
Ms. Lee.

220
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,720
Will you teach your people
basic business ethics?

221
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,750
What is it now?

222
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,289
Why are you here
talking about business ethics?

223
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,129
We work at different agencies
but we're all colleagues.

224
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,629
Aren't we?

225
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,029
We are. We're all colleagues.

226
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,240
So what?

227
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,769
What did Tae Young do now?

228
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,779
Yoon Gun Hee.

229
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,149
What 21st-century agent poaches players?

230
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,250
It's not the first time either.

231
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,879
Do you know what people call him?

232
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,919
Are you all right, Ms. Lee?

233
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,490
Yes. I know.

234
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,590
It's bad.

235
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,470
Kim Tae Young's not human.
He's more like a dog.

236
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,299
He forces his athlete to retire,

237
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:18,769
poaches from another agency,

238
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,500
bribes referees and coaches.

239
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,669
He even pays reporters.

240
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,509
Guess what? Recently...

241
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
The crazy...

242
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,490
Still, he does a good job.

243
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:44,759
He's a skilled dog.

244
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,860
You're right.

245
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,230
Everything you say is right, sir.

246
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,500
But will you just keep quiet?

247
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,639
Your stupid excuses
are just making things worse!

248
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,769
Is it normal to fling...

249
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,710
a bat around because he's ticked off?

250
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,179
What did you teach your kid?

251
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,480
This isn't the first time!

252
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,110
Don't take any reporters' calls.

253
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,379
Hide your son's phone first.

254
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,049
And you, talk only to me!

255
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,899
Relax. It's not that hard.

256
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,799
The fight between you and Yo Han...

257
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,669
that happened in the locker room.

258
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,509
It wasn't a fight. He beat me up.

259
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:32,080
He's a psycho.

260
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,740
He said my dialect was annoying,

261
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,379
and he swung a bat at me.

262
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:36,379
Yes, but...

263
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:39,320
You hit him once too.

264
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,490
Take a look.

265
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,960
This document is a memo,
a contract of sorts...

266
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,730
that says you won't talk about...

267
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,600
your fight with Yo Han to friends, family,

268
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,929
or especially the press.

269
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,639
What happens if I do talk?

270
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,639
If you talk...

271
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:08,179
Do you see the compensation
and contribution amounts here?

272
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,779
Talk and you won't get this.

273
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:19,320
You live with your grandmother.

274
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,830
With two younger siblings.

275
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:26,460
Yes.

276
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:29,029
(Kim Jin Chul)

277
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,299
Well done.

278
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,440
Money isn't all in life,

279
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:40,409
but then, nothing beats it.

280
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,580
Call me whenever you need something.

281
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,350
Bravo.

282
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,759
You majored in theater and film?

283
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,059
Your acting's just...
You could win an Oscar.

284
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,500
I almost thought you meant it.

285
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,600
I did mean it, Mr. Park the Reporter.

286
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,500
Nothing beats money in life.

287
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,639
Even so...

288
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,909
I guess you're right.

289
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,240
I am right, aren't I?

290
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,110
What are you doing? Why...

291
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,279
Okay, fine.

292
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,220
I'll drop it this time.

293
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,289
But not next time.

294
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,990
Park Yo Han
will get in real trouble one day.

295
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,090
Preventing that is my job.

296
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,059
- See you.
- My gosh.

297
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,370
He cares so much for his athletes.

298
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,769
You son of a witch.

299
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,639
I know.

300
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:46,179
- Just 50 dollars?
- Yes, I'm the son of a witch.

301
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,350
Even I have...

302
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:52,350
a wish, a dream that I cling to.

303
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,649
Why do you want to take a photo?

304
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,200
My hero back when I played baseball,
my battery Kim Hee Won.

305
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,440
That guy is the yet untainted...

306
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,910
real dream of mine.

307
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,670
(Kim Hee Won)

308
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:20,410
I believed that dream would save
the son of a witch that I once was.

309
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:22,809
I believed it with my heart.

310
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,119
Running 11 points behind
at the top of the seventh inning,

311
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,750
the Cheetahs switch pitchers.

312
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,819
- It's the fifth pitcher of the game.
- Yes.

313
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,119
Kim Hee Won takes the mound.

314
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,259
Oh, my gosh.

315
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:38,900
Why him of all people?

316
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,269
Cheetahs!

317
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Cheetahs, you morons!

318
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,039
You were last and now you're even worse!

319
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:51,069
Die, the lot of you!

320
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,940
Why send out Kim Hee Won?

321
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,549
Are you forfeiting the game?

322
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,150
Hey, you idiot! What can you do?

323
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,779
Are you out there to hand over points?

324
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:01,849
Go for it!

325
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:04,089
(Kim Hee Won)

326
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,089
Kim Hee Won has been doing...

327
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:07,690
the tough jobs all season.

328
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,029
He's doing
all the heavy-lifting for his team,

329
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:11,829
but his scores aren't great.

330
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,059
The first pitch is a ball.

331
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:16,599
Hee Won used to be the Cheetahs' ace.

332
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,869
He secured a total of 76 wins.

333
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,470
The Cheetahs won just twice,

334
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,940
- and that was during the Korean Series.
- Yes.

335
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,910
- He was a great pitcher.
- That's right.

336
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,980
Go for it, Kim Hee Won!

337
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,049
Good luck!

338
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,609
He takes a swing.

339
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:32,079
It's a foul.

340
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,289
(I've never wanted you to be a champion.
You were always one.)

341
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,809
Come on, sir.
This isn't what you promised.

342
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,140
What promise?

343
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,480
Did we make a promise?

344
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,450
You said you'd let Hee Won start.

345
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,980
You can't make him clean up
all the losing games.

346
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,880
Was the money I gave you not enough?

347
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,849
Are you bragging about
giving me chump change?

348
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,960
Did you ever see me brag?

349
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,490
Don't push it.

350
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,400
I was thinking of letting him
start the next game.

351
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,130
Before then, we should meet for a drink.

352
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,039
Let's catch up.

353
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,180
How do you feel?

354
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,250
The muscles here are tight.

355
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:43,990
Let's go out. My treat.

356
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:52,759
(18 years ago)

357
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:58,970
Three balls, two strikes, full count.

358
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,200
One throw will decide the game.

359
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,740
Yujin High's starter Kim Hee Won.

360
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,579
What ball will he throw?

361
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,119
It's off!

362
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,589
Strike!

363
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:19,059
Strike out!

364
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:20,390
The game's over!

365
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
The final score is eight to seven,

366
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,759
and Yujin High School...

367
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,730
wins the 33rd Bonghwangdaeki
National High School Championship!

368
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,440
- Go, team!
- Let's go!

369
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,609
(Winner, National High School
Baseball Championship)

370
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Hey!

371
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,059
How have you been?

372
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,529
I've been well, of course. What about you?

373
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:00,960
My gosh. That's so cool.

374
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
Are you jealous?

375
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:05,769
No.

376
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,700
Not at all.

377
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:09,769
Stop acting all tough.

378
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:13,079
I must say, it looks very cool.

379
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,690
Hey, Battery!

380
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,099
(Kim Hee Won)

381
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:42,769
It's our victory ball.

382
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,369
I'll wait for you.

383
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,309
You're confident
that you'll get picked, right?

384
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:47,309
Yes, of course.

385
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,410
Who else will go there, if not me?

386
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:53,619
When you go to the Major League,
I'll be right next to you.

387
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,950
Just wait and see.

388
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,190
Thanks.

389
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,690
Oh, thank you.

390
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,990
Here, let me.

391
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,490
I'm sorry.

392
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,599
I feel like I'm third-wheeling.

393
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,700
I've heard so much about you,

394
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,940
which is why I asked him...

395
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,170
to introduce me to you.

396
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,809
Oh, I see.

397
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:50,069
Well...

398
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,309
Kim Hee Won is in a bind.
He can get him out of the rut.

399
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:58,619
Gosh, please. Stop talking nonsense.
It's not even funny.

400
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Well...

401
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,650
Just call me Mr. Kim.

402
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:04,789
Yes.

403
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,460
"Sky Sports?"

404
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,960
I work at a private gambling house
that specializes in pro sports betting.

405
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,900
It's not big. It's a small company.

406
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
A private gambling house?

407
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,500
Are you saying it's illegal?

408
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:21,440
Then why are you here?

409
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,079
May I explain?

410
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,579
A successful gambler...

411
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,289
needs good luck and skills.

412
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,990
It's like fighting a war.

413
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,559
So there are times when
dealers like myself have to suffer a loss.

414
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:42,990
So the chairman of the company...

415
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,259
suggested we lead the games.

416
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,430
Chairman Nam Hyun Ki.

417
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,839
He owns several companies like Sky.

418
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,200
Okay, so?

419
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,910
Why are you here?

420
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,509
I came to relay the chairman's message.

421
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,519
We'd like to hire Kim Hee Won
as one of our players.

422
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,619
Darn it.

423
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,730
You said he'd be the starter
in the next game.

424
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,029
Was this what it meant?

425
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:24,470
Score rigging?

426
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:28,410
Even if I'm the biggest jerk in the world,

427
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,410
I'll never sell off my players like this.

428
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,509
It was Hee Won.

429
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,650
Not me.

430
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:42,089
He bit the bait.

431
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,059
He said he'd do it
if you gave him the go-ahead.

432
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,390
He still thinks of you...

433
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,460
as his agent.

434
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:51,859
Got more gibberish to say?

435
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Sit back down.

436
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,130
Sit down!

437
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,410
Kim.

438
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,819
In the past few years,

439
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,089
were you even interested in Kim Hee Won?
Be honest.

440
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,460
While you were busy
profiting off the other players,

441
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,430
Chairman Nam took care of Hee Won,
who was left all alone.

442
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,200
He sent gifts to his family celebrations,

443
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,160
sent him on a trip every season,

444
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,769
and got him treated for his injuries.

445
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:30,500
If he's such a kind man,

446
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:33,099
how could he use a player
as a mere casino card?

447
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,309
If Hee Won gets caught,
his career is over!

448
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:36,809
He won't get caught.

449
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,279
Hee Won...

450
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:40,279
bit the bait because he's confident.

451
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,509
Are you kidding me?

452
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,809
You're his manager, aren't you?

453
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:57,589
Let's go for 1 IP, 2 BB.

454
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,269
Simple, right?

455
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:05,869
At the beginning,

456
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,039
we'll keep it simple and easy.

457
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:09,369
Okay?

458
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,740
This season, Kim Hee Won...

459
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,009
earned 17 BB for every 9 innings pitched,
which is a lot.

460
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,319
If a player like that
earns 2 BB by the 5th inning,

461
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,819
no one will suspect him. Am I wrong?

462
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:23,519
Are you done talking?

463
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,490
The club is talking
about ousting Kim Hee Won.

464
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:34,200
Chairman Nam is offering to save him.

465
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,069
He knows nothing but baseball.

466
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,839
Are you really going
to neglect him like this?

467
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,599
Cut the nonsense.

468
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,210
I can't listen
to this despicable gibberish.

469
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,170
Hey, Battery!

470
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,210
Can you still pitch at 160km per hour?

471
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:23,579
What brings you here?

472
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,750
You said you were busy.

473
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,920
I had a few drinks.

474
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,130
I was out drinking.

475
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,700
Go ahead and pitch.

476
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:51,069
Monster Pitcher, let's act like
we're friends for a change.

477
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,500
Darn it. Aren't you Monster Pitcher?

478
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,630
Hey.

479
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:21,170
Throw it properly, will you?

480
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:25,210
Why come here and go on a drunken rampage?

481
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:27,839
Stop bugging me and leave.
I need to practice.

482
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,240
Hee Won.

483
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,210
You should retire.

484
00:28:58,579 --> 00:28:59,579
What?

485
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,109
You should retire...

486
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,950
while you're still sellable.

487
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,950
Have you seen anyone
who got involved with Chairman Nam...

488
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,079
end up well?

489
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:11,650
I'll deal with them.

490
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,430
You should just retire.

491
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:19,200
Retire, okay?

492
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,640
I'm hearing this, at last.

493
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,339
I knew you didn't hesitate
to force your players to retire...

494
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:31,039
when you deemed them useless,

495
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,079
but I really didn't think
you'd say this to me.

496
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,910
If I retire,

497
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,250
how will I and my family survive?

498
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,619
I'll find a way for you to earn a living.

499
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:44,789
You?

500
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,589
I'm a hundred times better
than those scumbags who rig scores.

501
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,470
Hey, you know I'm a jerk.

502
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:00,339
You don't need...

503
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:02,609
another jerk in your life.

504
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:07,309
So just ignore what other jerks tell you.

505
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:10,910
I'll do whatever it takes
to make sure you can earn a living!

506
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,450
Hee Won!

507
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,390
I heard you...

508
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:22,559
loud and clear,

509
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:24,789
so leave now.

510
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,500
You understand, right?

511
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,059
Yes, I heard you.

512
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,029
So leave.

513
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,740
I'm leaving too.

514
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,369
Hee Won.

515
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,210
I know that it's crushing your pride,

516
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,109
but let me say this one more time.

517
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,279
Ignore those jerks!

518
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,049
Okay?

519
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,670
Are you looking for Lee Kwon Sook?

520
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,410
I never said I would.

521
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:13,009
I'm going to believe in you.

522
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,180
I will.

523
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:20,880
I haven't told any of the agents yet.

524
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,619
You know what that means, don't you?

525
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,130
(Jung Soo Yeon from About)

526
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,299
I'm busy. What is it?

527
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,569
Come on, Kim. Is this all we amount to?

528
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,640
I know that we are at each other's throats
when we fight.

529
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,940
But we are supposed
to tell each other news, good or bad.

530
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:48,539
I thought I deserved that from you.

531
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:50,109
What's this about?

532
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,680
Look at you, acting innocent.

533
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,890
Why didn't you tell me that
Hee Won was starting today?

534
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,319
This is such amazing news.

535
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,349
What do you mean?

536
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:00,059
He's starting what today?

537
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,490
What? Are you serious?
Aren't you at the stadium?

538
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:05,430
I was about to order some fried chicken.

539
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,230
What are you talking about?

540
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,769
Well, Hee Won was
the starting pitcher today.

541
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,539
He hasn't allowed any points yet.
And it's the top of the third inning.

542
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,940
Darn it.

543
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,670
Look at his manners.

544
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,069
How come he didn't know that?

545
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,509
I thought he knew everything
about Hee Won.

546
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:24,279
(Whales, Cheetahs)

547
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,700
That's another ball.
There are three balls now.

548
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,460
If he strikes out one more batter,

549
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,670
he can be the winning pitcher of the game.

550
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,470
But this is a full count now.

551
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,769
It had been four years
since he had been the starting pitcher.

552
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:51,339
He's already thrown a lot of pitches,
so he can't play after this inning.

553
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:54,210
If he throws one more ball, the game
will be tied with the bases loaded.

554
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,380
This will be an important pitch for him.

555
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,450
That's right.

556
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,950
(Kim Hee Won)

557
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,609
Don't push it.

558
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:26,509
I was thinking of letting him
start the next game.

559
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:27,740
Let's go for 1 IP, 2 BB.

560
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:31,549
Simple, right?

561
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:33,720
If a player like that
earns 2 BB by the 5th inning,

562
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,319
no one will suspect him. Am I wrong?

563
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:40,220
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

564
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,660
How many walks has the pitcher had so far?

565
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,990
How many walks? I think there were three.

566
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,559
No. Only in this inning.

567
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,029
I see. In this inning.
Only one walked so far.

568
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:51,799
It's flying to the left. It's a foul ball.

569
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,299
This is his sixth foul ball.

570
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,200
- It's okay!
- It's okay!

571
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,450
There goes his seventh pitch!

572
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,050
It's a foul ball.

573
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,519
The eighth pitch. The batter hit the ball.

574
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:11,949
Foul.

575
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,320
The 9th pitch. The 10th pitch.

576
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,929
That was pretty dangerous.
Lee Dong Kyu hits another foul ball.

577
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,000
Timeout.

578
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,039
Dad, you can do this!

579
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,639
(Strikeout Genius Kim Hee Won)

580
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,079
That crazy jerk.

581
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:52,090
- Strike him out!
- Strike him out!

582
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,030
- Strike him out!
- Strike him out!

583
00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:00,000
- Strike him out!
- Strike him out!

584
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,570
I wonder what kind of ball
Hee Won will throw this time.

585
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,909
This is his 11th pitch
against Lee Dong Kyu.

586
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:07,579
His pitching is solid,
but it doesn't seem to help right now.

587
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:09,909
Then it's better to go
with the best pitch he can throw...

588
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:11,449
from the mound.

589
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,150
- Strike him out!
- Strike him out!

590
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:18,320
- Strike him out!
- Strike him out!

591
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,760
- Strike him out!
- Strike him out!

592
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:25,800
- Kim Hee Won!
- Kim Hee Won!

593
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,329
- Kim Hee Won!
- Kim Hee Won!

594
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:32,769
- Kim Hee Won!
- Kim Hee Won!

595
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:36,170
- Kim Hee Won!
- Kim Hee Won!

596
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,480
- Kim Hee Won!
- Kim Hee Won!

597
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,710
- Kim Hee Won!
- Kim Hee Won!

598
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:53,860
He swings and misses. It's a strikeout!

599
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,389
That ends the inning.

600
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:58,329
Gosh, that was a fastball.

601
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:00,829
Given the course of his pitch,
it was directed toward the center.

602
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:02,199
- But he swung and missed.
- Yes.

603
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:05,269
Based on that, I can say that
his pitching was excellent.

604
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,800
- Nice.
- Nice.

605
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,510
- Nice.
- Nice.

606
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:14,039
- Kim Hee Won.
- Kim Hee Won.

607
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:17,510
- Kim Hee Won.
- Kim Hee Won.

608
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,179
- Kim Hee Won.
- Kim Hee Won.

609
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,389
Darn it. Come on.

610
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,309
You son of a witch, Yang Man Hee!

611
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,110
What did you make him do?

612
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,949
Gosh, that rude jerk.

613
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:51,250
You don't know anything.

614
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:55,619
Calm down. Okay?

615
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:58,090
You can't take it out on the coach.

616
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,119
Coach Yang is also a victim
in all of this.

617
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,329
What? Get out of my way.

618
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:03,889
He didn't have to think.

619
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,630
He just had to throw the balls
just as planned. It was a simple job.

620
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,659
A simple job?

621
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,429
Does it look like a simple job to you?

622
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:12,639
Baseball had been his entire life.

623
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,170
Baseball was his everything,
you son of a witch!

624
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,769
You've got this all wrong!

625
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
You see,

626
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,110
I was going to pull him out.

627
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,780
You didn't want him to do it,

628
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,289
so we couldn't force him.

629
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:34,219
But it was Kim Hee Won
who wanted to proceed with this game.

630
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,460
He came to me that night
and told me he had to do it.

631
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,159
I'm sincerely worried too.

632
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,940
The damage is pretty severe.

633
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,110
Kim Hee Won has no idea
how the real world works.

634
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,139
Do you know how miserable
he's going to be from here on out?

635
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,550
The chairman may put up with injustice,

636
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,619
but he doesn't put up with loss.

637
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,530
Ye Jun, stop running around.

638
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,030
- You're distracting your dad.
- Ye Jun, don't run.

639
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,070
- Dad.
- Don't run.

640
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,599
- Dad.
- Yes.

641
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:21,469
You'll win the next one too, right?

642
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:26,409
Of course. If you cheer for me,

643
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,880
I can win anytime.

644
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,780
Come here.

645
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,289
Why did you do it?

646
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,590
Don't you know your career would be ruined
if you got caught rigging games?

647
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,630
Don't you know that the worst crime...

648
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,389
an athlete can possibly commit
is match fixing?

649
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,800
I'm sorry.

650
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,900
You were the one who went to those jerks.

651
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,570
Why did you do that?

652
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,369
Come on. Tell me.

653
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,139
Why did you go see them?

654
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,179
I needed money.

655
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
Money?

656
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,210
Are you gambling?

657
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,150
Were you conned? What happened?

658
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:44,690
You should've come to me first!

659
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,519
I could've done something to help!

660
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,789
- I did.
- Did what?

661
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,460
I told you.

662
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
See you.

663
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:56,199
Tae Young.

664
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,500
Do you have some money?

665
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Money?

666
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,739
Why? What is it for?

667
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,079
It's for some family stuff.

668
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,309
My son Ye Jun...

669
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:11,309
Sorry, wait.

670
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,420
If it's not urgent,
let's talk another time.

671
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,820
I'll call.

672
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,260
Mr. Kang, you finally got back to me.

673
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,789
I was waiting for your call.

674
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,800
You're always busy.

675
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,400
You always forget.

676
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:32,170
You're always just talk.

677
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Hee Won.

678
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,070
You said...

679
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:38,340
you'd make me a major-leaguer.

680
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:40,780
That if I just trained,
you'd handle the rest.

681
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
But...

682
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,880
look at me now.

683
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,289
You're 80 percent responsible
for my failed career.

684
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:53,289
That's not right at all.

685
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:54,519
How is it not?

686
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,829
You ruined my chances of going abroad.

687
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,929
Not on purpose.

688
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,000
I tried to negotiate a better deal!

689
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,829
I told you clearly
that I'd go for any amount!

690
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,130
I didn't care if my pay
was a million dollars or not!

691
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,099
Not that again!

692
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,070
Darn it.

693
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:12,739
Fine.

694
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,010
Let's say it's my fault
you couldn't go to the US.

695
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:19,380
What does that
have to do with match fixing?

696
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,449
Is that why you did it?

697
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:21,920
For a few bucks?

698
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,289
Let's be honest.

699
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:26,489
You messed up your own career
after the US deal fell through.

700
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:29,829
You kept drinking
instead of going to rehab!

701
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:31,789
My son's sick, you scumbag!

702
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,230
What?

703
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,239
Ye Jun's sick.

704
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,170
He'll go blind if we don't do something.

705
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,710
A US company has developed a cure.

706
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,139
One injection is all it takes,

707
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,519
but the cure costs
500,000 dollars per eye.

708
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:55,889
All I needed was some money.

709
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:58,690
But I was getting older,

710
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,019
I wasn't getting a break,
and my injury wouldn't heal.

711
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,559
I'd spent all my savings
on my surgery and rehab.

712
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:04,559
What else should I have done?

713
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:06,000
Should I have just died?

714
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,900
You should've come to me even more!

715
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:11,369
What if I did?

716
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,900
What would that change?

717
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,710
Forget it.

718
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,079
I'll handle this.

719
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,780
What can you do?

720
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,650
You said I'm 80 percent responsible
for your failed career.

721
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:31,389
The other 20 percent.

722
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,489
I'll salvage it somehow.

723
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,730
Darn you.

724
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:15,429
Isn't it a lovely sight?

725
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,630
I didn't have such a childhood.

726
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,670
My father was rarely home.

727
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,239
That's real paradise.

728
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,780
I'm envious.

729
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,750
I heard you're the same.

730
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,320
Your mother raised you and your brother.

731
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,090
Who told you about me?

732
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,719
Hee Won's a great dad.

733
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:45,260
He called me after the game.

734
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:48,030
To apologize for not keeping his word.

735
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,530
He said he'd return the money.

736
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:55,269
He's unaware that it's more complex
than just returning the money.

737
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:57,739
It's a huge pity.

738
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:02,280
He didn't think his son would be there.

739
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:05,849
I bet he wanted the boy to see him win.

740
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,150
Since he's a dad.

741
00:44:11,389 --> 00:44:12,590
Sorry.

742
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,820
Seriously, Dad?

743
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,860
- Thank you.
- Sure.

744
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,030
How nice.

745
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:29,539
Why did you ask to see me?

746
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,010
I'll sort this one out.

747
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:36,510
It's a big ask,

748
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,050
but pay for Ye Jun's treatment too.

749
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,389
I'll pay you for that too.

750
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:45,789
Leave Hee Won alone.

751
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,090
Why?

752
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,760
Why take responsibility
for what you didn't do?

753
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,530
Because I'm his agent.

754
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:04,210
You're an amusing guy.

755
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,710
Am I funny?

756
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,780
I said this was on me.

757
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,150
Do you need another reason?

758
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,320
No.

759
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,579
I don't.

760
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,190
Sorry.

761
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,989
It's contrary to what I heard about you.

762
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,559
Whatever the reason...

763
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,530
Okay, fine.

764
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:36,510
Here's the chairman's answer.

765
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,050
My gosh!

766
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,920
Hello?

767
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:08,059
Hello?

768
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,760
Sorry for the rough handling.

769
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,530
You must be in shock.

770
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,900
You must be out of your mind!

771
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,829
I didn't want to do this either.

772
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:20,800
I just do this for a living.
I hope you understand.

773
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:22,369
You son of a witch!

774
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:25,969
Would you understand
if this happened to you?

775
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:28,639
Don't be too angry.

776
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,250
You should have the chairman's reply.

777
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:50,130
(Promise to Pay: 2.5 million dollars)

778

(Three Teeth Knocked Out)

781
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,309
All right. This is where
you can watch all kinds of fights!

782
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:35,280
- "Three Teeth Knocked Out!"
- "Three Teeth Knocked Out!"

783
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,809
Oh, what did we say
we were going to talk about today?

784
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,619
The genius boxer who fell off
the face of the earth three years ago.

785
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,519
Lee Kwon Sook!

786
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,460
My gosh. I'm a die-hard fan!

787
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,690
When she disappeared,

788
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,329
I couldn't sleep for a month.

789
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:54,400
When exactly did she go missing,
Reporter Park?

790
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,300
The day before her title match
with Han Ah Reum.

791
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,000
There were all kinds of rumors back then.

792
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,139
Some said she was kidnapped.

793
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:02,539
Some believed
she eloped with her boyfriend...

794
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:03,969
or jumped into the Han River.

795
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:05,809
I even heard a theory...

796
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,679
that Han Ah Reum hired a hitman
because she was afraid she'd lose.

797
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:09,710
- Really?
- Yes.

798
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:10,750
I've never heard this before.

799
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,179
- You didn't know?
- No!

800
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:13,949
Okay. Be quiet, you two.

801
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,550
So?

802
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,190
Did you find Lee Kwon Sook or not?
Tell us.

803
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:19,590
That's...

804
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:25,230
After the commercial break.

805
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,500
- Gosh!
- Darn it.

806
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,960
I can't believe he stopped right there.

807
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,570
Goodness. I knew he'd do that.

808
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:35,000
I suppose President Jung
of the Boxing Association...

809
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,969
is asking people to help find her.

810
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:42,940
At this rate,
all sorts of riffraff will jump in.

811
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,250
Hey, call Reporter Park
and ask him if he's found Lee Kwon Sook.

812
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,449
Don't you think it'd be all over
the news already if he'd found her?

813
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:54,559
You know how Reporter Park is.

814
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,489
Right? He probably hasn't found her yet.

815
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,099
I suppose it's my turn to step in.

816
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:13,440
Where is Kim Tae Young?
How come he's nowhere to be seen?

817

Gosh, that rude jerk.
You don't know anything.

821
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,829
Oh, this?

822
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:08,400
- It has shine muscat too.
- I see.

823
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,400
This looks good.

824
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,800
Darn it.

825
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,469
(Mr. Kim at Sky)

826
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,179
Hey.

827
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:25,980
What do you think you're doing?

828
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,519
It's like insurance, you see.

829
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,380
Nothing will happen.

830
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,920
If you keep your promise, that is.

831
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,250
Your money...

832
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,360
I'll pay you back in full.

833
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:36,989
I'll pay you back, no matter what.

834
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:40,059
But you'd better leave my mom alone.

835
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:42,400
If not, I don't know what I'd do.
Do you hear me?

836
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,329
Luckily for you,
Chairman Nam is giving you three months.

837
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,639
Either pay us back or make the game happen
within three months.

838
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,940
Otherwise, I won't even be able
to face Chairman Nam.

839
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,110
Darn it!

840
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,690
Hey.

841
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:13,659
Why are you sitting there like that?

842
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,739
What do you think?
I was waiting for you, Mom.

843
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:23,610
I'm hungry, Mom.

844
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:27,380
Did you lose the key again?

845
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,610
I made a new copy for you the other day.

846
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,809
I know. I lost it again.

847
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:36,719
I hate keys. I keep losing them.

848
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,590
Goodness. You're not even 40 yet,

849
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,690
but you're already so forgetful.

850
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,329
Mom.

851
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,500
Since I'm here anyway, let me change it
to a digital door lock today.

852
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,829
You know, the thing
where you have to punch in numbers.

853
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:53,130
And let's put up
some security cameras too.

854
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:55,800
What? Why bother?

855
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,170
There's nothing to steal.

856
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,110
I find it so uncomfortable. That's why.

857
00:54:01,309 --> 00:54:04,449
If it's that uncomfortable for you,
then I can't stop you.

858
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:07,579
Mom.

859
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,179
Do you have some money?

860
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,650
Money?

861
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,289
Why?

862
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,460
How much do you need?

863
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,329
I only asked because I was worried
you'd be running out of pocket money.

864
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,469
My goodness.

865
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,769
Do you want to go on a trip with Auntie?

866
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:31,869
You can go to Jeju Island with her.

867
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,880
A trip, all of a sudden?

868
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:37,409
Your aunt can't even walk a lot
because of her joints.

869
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,210
And what about the store?

870
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:43,179
I have so many customers
who only buy fruits from my store.

871
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:51,860
Come and eat.

872
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:54,960
Hey, what are you doing?

873
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:01,440
He said he was hungry.
Why is he suddenly napping?

874
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:06,539
Hey, Tae Young.

875
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:08,780
Goodness.

876
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:12,579
Hey, what's wrong?

877
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:14,449
Are you not feeling well?

878
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,550
Where does it hurt?

879
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:26,389
My heart?

880
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:31,329
My goodness. You gave me such a scare.

881
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:40,639
(1 Iced Americano)

882
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:44,280
Thank you.

883
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:46,150
One more iced Americano, please.

884
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,780
With an extra shot.

885
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:52,650
Yes, sure.

886
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,289
What kind of agent makes a reporter
pay for her coffee?

887
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,329
That's how I got the team manager title
in my fourth year,

888
00:55:59,329 --> 00:56:01,329
whereas Mr. Kim Tae Young still
isn't a manager even after ten years.

889
00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:03,829
Come on. Titles don't matter.
Your compensation is what matters.

890
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,130
I heard Mr. Kim was number one
in the industry.

891
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,570
He gets the highest pay.

892
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:12,170
I enjoyed "Three Teeth Knocked Out."
The one on Lee Kwon Sook.

893
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:15,110
- You watched it?
- So? Did you find her?

894
00:56:15,579 --> 00:56:16,909
It wasn't revealed in Part One.

895
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:19,179
If you're curious,
watch Part Two next week.

896
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:22,150
And be sure to like the video,
leave a comment, and subscribe.

897
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,760
So you haven't found her.

898
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,960
I am still trying to track her down.

899
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,369
Oh. Anyway, have a good day.

900
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:38,829
I have to go.

901
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:41,739
Okay, bye.

902
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,510
My gosh, Assistant Inspector Lee.

903
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,969
Really?

904
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,980
Ms. Lee, that's your coffee.

905
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,050
What? You bought me a coffee?

906
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,650
They have a 2-for-1 deal until tomorrow.

907
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,659
You can get me one tomorrow.

908
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,630
I knew it.

909
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:09,460
President Jung of the Boxing Association
has no conditions?

910
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:10,800
What about President Jung?

911
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:12,570
They want us to find Lee Kwon Sook.

912
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:14,400
What are the association's conditions?

913
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,639
How could there be any, in this situation?

914
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:20,139
They want us to find her
and put her in the ring.

915
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:22,480
The commission will be 200,000 dollars,
and we'll get all the profits.

916
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,309
If I find her, give me full authority.

917
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,449
As if I never did.

918
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:32,150
But she won't come back easily
even if you manage to find her.

919
00:57:32,889 --> 00:57:34,159
Do you know how you'll persuade her?

920
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,929
She'll come back if we create a situation
where she has no choice.

921
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,489
I decide the commission amount.

922
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,730
What?

923
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:48,440
Gosh, that little...
This is like daylight robbery.

924
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:54,710
All right.

925
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,579
I think Lee Kwon Sook is...

926
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,380
dead.

927
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:04,190
She died? When?

928
00:58:06,389 --> 00:58:08,219
No, I mean that's what my gut tells me.

929
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,190
Watch what you say.

930
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,300
You know Lee Chul Yong, right?
Lee Kwon Sook's coach.

931
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,829
Yes, her father.

932
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:20,030
(Champion Ox Bone Soup)

933
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,699
He retired about 20 years ago.

934
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:24,639
He opened an ox bone soup restaurant.

935
00:58:26,139 --> 00:58:27,139
It's good.

936
00:58:27,139 --> 00:58:28,840
- What?
- Sorry.

937
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:33,579
Lee Kwon Sook stopped going
to his restaurant too.

938
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:34,579
No one's seen her.

939
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:36,650
But the food is good.

940
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:40,960
The sushi was great.

941
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:42,389
Let's eat here again next time, Kim.

942
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,889
Gosh, there's no next time.

943
00:58:43,889 --> 00:58:46,260
Gosh. Have you seen this?

944
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,260
What?

945
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,300
The online forum,
looking for Lee Kwon Sook.

946
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:52,570
At one point, there was a reward too.

947
00:58:53,869 --> 00:58:55,469
An award of 80,000 dollars.

948
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:58,739
An award of 80,000 dollars.

949
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,010
Right.

950
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:03,539
It's a lot of money for a mere reward.

951
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,409
Imagine how many people tried to find her.

952
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:10,420
She moved around a lot during those years
after going into hiding.

953
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,190
I see. Yes, it's her.

954
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:18,889
She used to live in that unit.

955
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,659
I don't know what she did for a living.

956
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,329
But she kept going out
early in the morning.

957
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:26,269
- Early in the morning?
- Yes.

958
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:28,070
And she moved out
in the middle of the night too...

959
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:29,539
like she was on the run
from her creditors.

960
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,780
But...

961
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,920
since when did you start
taking an interest in boxing?

962
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:44,920
What are you going to do
with the runaway boxer?

963
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:47,360
I'm looking for her
because the agency told me to find her.

964
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,730
Oh, right. Did I tell you?

965
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,190
What?

966
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:56,059
Lee Kwon Sook changed her name.

967
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,900
Why are you telling me that now?

968
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:03,670
You never asked.

969
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:05,340
Can I have this too?
It's on the gold plate.

970
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,340
- Don't eat that.
- Come on. What are you doing?

971
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,940
- Kim, don't be petty!
- No, I'll eat it.

972
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,949
I'm going to eat it.

973
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:13,679
Here's another one.

974
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,099
- Ms. Yu Ri!
- Ms. Yu Ri!

975
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:35,699
- Ms. Yu Ri!
- Ms. Yu Ri!

976
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:37,369
Ms. Yu Ri!

977
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:40,070
You can cut this with your bare hands,
right?

978
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:41,280
Right?

979
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,309
What? The apple?

980
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:44,849
Yes.

981
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:47,679
Hey, did you know?
Ms. Yu Ri is super strong.

982
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:51,849
I saw her lift the big totem pole
and move it all by herself the other day.

983
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,300
Really?

984
01:01:07,699 --> 01:01:09,099
- Is that true?
- Is that true?

985
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:17,949
Gosh, how could I lift that by myself?

986
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:19,909
I lifted that with the other teachers.

987
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,420
I knew it.

988
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,579
You're always lying to us.

989
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:24,590
No, I didn't lie.

990
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:26,449
I saw it myself!

991
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:27,989
Ms. Yu Ri.

992
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:31,260
Come on. You lifted that by yourself.

993
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:32,960
Come on. That's true.

994
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,760
No. Don't cry.

995
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,670
Then I'll cut the apple for you.

996
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:38,769
Give it to me.

997
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,309
All right. Look at this, everyone.

998
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,949
The cooking teacher is going to scold you.

999
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,550
The cooking teacher said
we should never do that.

1000
01:01:54,849 --> 01:01:56,679
We were told to wash the apple
in running water to make it...

1001
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:58,590
- squeaky clean.
- Squeaky clean.

1002
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:03,889
Right. We have to wash apples thoroughly
before eating them.

1003
01:02:04,489 --> 01:02:07,429
If we don't wash them,
the dirty Baikinman will...

1004
01:02:15,769 --> 01:02:16,769
There you are.

1005
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:18,210
Save me!

1006
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:21,280
I got you.

1007
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,340
She got me.

1008
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,559
Gosh, this tastes great.

1009
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,530
This is my favorite time of the day.

1010
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:45,530
Same here.

1011
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,400
Not me.

1012
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,269
The time to get off work
is the best time of the day.

1013
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,269
That's true.

1014
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,840
Right, Yu Ri.
I set it up as a lunch date for tomorrow.

1015
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,110
He'll text you.

1016
01:02:57,409 --> 01:02:58,409
That fast?

1017
01:02:58,750 --> 01:02:59,750
What's this about?

1018
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:01,949
Is it a blind date?

1019
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,420
I showed him a picture of her.

1020
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,849
And he just went crazy.

1021
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,219
Actually, I don't want to go on the date.

1022
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:10,389
- Why not?
- Why not?

1023
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:13,929
No. He's been on my back
about this date. You have to go.

1024
01:03:13,929 --> 01:03:15,099
The date is already scheduled.

1025
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,400
Yu Ri, it's not because of
your embarrassing past, right?

1026
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,670
Come on.

1027
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:22,469
Her embarrassing past? What is it?

1028
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,269
It was
when she had just started working here.

1029
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:27,309
Mi Jung hooked her up with a guy.

1030
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:29,780
Come on. Please stop. I'm begging you.

1031
01:03:29,909 --> 01:03:31,380
Can you please stop?

1032
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,480
Where are you going?

1033
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,929
Yu Ri, I hope
you can make your first boyfriend.

1034
01:03:47,929 --> 01:03:49,559
Stop making excuses and get a boyfriend.

1035
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,170
Have steak instead of jokbal.

1036
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:04,250
You don't have to cut it for me.

1037
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:07,619
You seemed nervous.

1038
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,420
It's hard to cut things
when your hands are shaking.

1039
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:16,519
Here.

1040
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:27,300
What is it?

1041
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,670
Is something on my face?

1042
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:33,340
No. Was I staring?

1043
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:36,110
Yes. Kind of?

1044
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:39,380
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

1045
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,280
By the way,

1046
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:45,989
has anyone said you resemble someone?

1047
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:47,119
Well,

1048
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:50,559
my mom, perhaps?

1049
01:04:53,329 --> 01:04:54,329
Yu Ri.

1050
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:56,760
You're Lee Kwon Sook, right?

1051
01:05:02,539 --> 01:05:05,269
No. I'm not her.

1052
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:07,110
Come on. You are her.

1053
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,840
Gosh.
Eun Sol kept saying that you weren't.

1054
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,050
I thought I was mistaken.

1055
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,579
But you're much prettier in person.

1056
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:14,949
This is crazy.

1057
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:16,050
That's not me.

1058
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,019
Why did you disappear back then?

1059
01:05:18,019 --> 01:05:21,260
You should've fought against Han Ah Reum
and won the champion title.

1060
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:22,590
When will you come back?

1061
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:24,489
You should have a revenge match
with Han Ah Reum.

1062
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,260
Why did you change your name?

1063
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,900
I love your name, Lee Kwon Sook.
It's perfect for you.

1064
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,269
That's a fitting name for a boxer. Right?

1065
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:40,139
I'm sorry, but I'll get going.

1066
01:05:40,139 --> 01:05:42,039
What? Wait.

1067
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:44,010
Wait.

1068
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:46,280
Then can we take a picture together?

1069
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,449
If you're not her, you wouldn't mind...

1070
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:49,550
taking a picture.

1071
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,889
- I'll take the picture now. Smile.
- Stop it.

1072
01:05:55,889 --> 01:05:57,489
One, two...

1073
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:58,960
Three.

1074
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,760
Hey, what are you doing?

1075
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,429
What's your problem? Give back my phone.

1076
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,800
Wait.

1077
01:06:09,769 --> 01:06:10,969
It looks like you're not single.

1078
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,309
Why did you go through my cell phone?

1079
01:06:14,909 --> 01:06:17,349
I was just checking
in case you took her pictures.

1080
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:21,349
Let's go.

1081
01:06:21,949 --> 01:06:24,219
You don't have to be polite
to a rude jerk like him.

1082
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:54,880
You are more patient...

1083
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,519
than I thought.

1084
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:06,130
Do you know me?

1085
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:10,559
Of course.

1086
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:17,639
I wanted to meet you,

1087
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:20,010
Ms. Lee Kwon Sook.

1088
01:07:31,489 --> 01:07:33,119
(Special appearances: Park Chong Pal,
Chang Jung Koo, Yuh Myung Woo,)

1089
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,159
(Shin Bo Mi Re, Jang Sung Ho)

1090
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:38,530
(My Lovely Boxer)

1091
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,550
Gosh. You said
you weren't interested in our business.

1092
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:03,079
Lee Kwon Sook?

1093
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:04,789
- First off,
- Who is he?

1094
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:07,150
I'm going to get her to come back
to the ring as soon as possible.

1095
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,719
I went on a blind date with her
a while ago.

1096
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:12,190
I told you I would never go back
to the ring! Never!

1097
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,590
Even if I leave you alone,
someone else will come.

1098
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,159
You can keep running, but people
will find you over and over again.

1099
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:17,699
Why were you hiding in this kindergarten?

1100
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:20,369
I'll make it my life's mission
to stop you from running away!

1101
01:08:20,369 --> 01:08:23,069
She might never be able to box again.

1102
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,939
Isn't she perfect to use and then discard?

1103
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,369
How cold-hearted.

1104
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:30,210
You're a true businessman. Right, Father?

1105
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:34,250
The tastiest thing we serve is water.

1106
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,720
If I can get you to sign the papers,

1107
01:08:38,449 --> 01:08:40,119
I'll do even worse stuff than this.
