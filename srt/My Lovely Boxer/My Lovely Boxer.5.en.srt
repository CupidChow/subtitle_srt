Mister.

5
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:27,880
Yes.

00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,650
Can I really tell you anything I want?

8
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:37,491
Yes. Go ahead.

9
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:40,190
I'm...

10
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:44,430
scared of boxing.

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,470
But...

12
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:51,741
I will win today's game.

13
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,430
Don't let her hit you even once.

14
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:18,331
Today, beat her all you want.

15
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:25,200
What are you doing? You need to get going.

16
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,010
Come on. Hurry.

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,821
- Get the ice packs.
- Got it.

18

(Emperor Diet Boxing)

19
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,941
My, look at that.

20
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:06,650
While you guys were in the restroom...
See that?

21
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,751
- It's a full house.
- Yes, this is it.

22
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:11,221
This is why I've been waiting
for Lee Gweon Suk!

We don't need to explain this lineup.

25
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:15,651
Look how excited everyone is.

26
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:16,760

we'll get started!

42
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:03,971

she has never lost.

The in-fighter...

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,811
with a 100-percent knockout ratio.

47
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,781
The invincible slugger
known for her lethal punches!

48
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,450
- Team Emperor.
- Let's go!

49
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,990
- Lee Gweon Suk.
- Let's go!

50
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,561
- You're here.
- Hey.

51
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:35,131
Why did they call out Ms. Lee first?

52
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,501
Everyone came to see her.

53
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:38,001
She lost her ranking.

54
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:39,841
She's the underdog now.

55
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,480
Come on. You should have
at least played some music for her.

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,181
The atmosphere feels way too dull.

57
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,790
She didn't want me to play any music.

58
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:55,691
She didn't want the ring to be special.

59
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,091
Seriously.
She's a particular lady, isn't she?

60
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,191
You got this, Gweon Suk!

61
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:04,531
Contending against her is
the fighter from the red corner,

62

the hipster of Korean boxers.

63

Jo A Ra.

64

Come on out!

65
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,911
Lee Gweon Suk, the genius on the run.

66
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:15,610
You just wait there.

67
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:18,080
I'll make you regret
not running away today.

68

75
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:34,760
She has it in the bag.

76
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,200
Don't you think
she's going to win this one?

77
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,131
She's the hipster boxer.

78
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:39,671
She's currently number four
in the bantamweight class in Asia.

79
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:40,830
She's an out-boxer.

80
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,671
She can land a nasty punch
with her left hand.

81
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:44,001
She's one of the best southpaws.

82
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,910
Wait.

83
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:52,280
Gosh, Mr. Han. Hurry up!

84
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,410
Let him take his sweet time, Eun Sol.
We didn't even invite him.

85
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,510
Why did he come with us?

86
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:58,181
Wait up for me!

87
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,791
(We love you, Lee Gweon Suk.)

88
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:01,751
There she is. Oh, my!

89
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:03,491
Gosh.

90
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:08,061
(The Cutest Superwoman of Class Flowers)

91
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
What about mine?

92
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,330
I should hold up a board too.

93
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,970
Why did you make only three? Seriously.

94
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,600
Lee Gweon Suk!

95
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:20,171
Lee Gweon Suk!

96
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,811
Lee Gweon Suk!

97
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,541
Lee Gweon Suk!

98
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,350
This is the main event of today's match.

99
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,181
Let me introduce the fighters today.
From the red corner,

100
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:31,520
we have a fighter from Gojan Gym.

101
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,650
Weight, 53.5kg.

102
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,350
She's had 6 victories and 1 loss.

103
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,390
She had six knockout victories.

104
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,760
She's a powerful southpaw
and has incredible footwork.

105
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,561
The hipster of Korean boxers!

106
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:47,501
Jo A Ra!

107
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
- Jo A Ra, we love you!
- Jo A Ra, we love you!

108
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,010
- Jo A Ra.
- Jo A Ra.

109
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,941
- Jo A Ra, you got this!
- Jo A Ra, you got this!

110
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,850
Contending against her is the blue corner.

111
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,921
The fighter is from Emperor Diet Boxing.

112
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:08,890
Weight, 53.37kg.

113
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,861
She had 1 victory and forfeited 1 match.

114
00:06:10,861 --> 00:06:15,491
The genius boxer who destroyed
Estomata with one punch.

115
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:21,700
Lee Gweon Suk!

116
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,811
Touch gloves.

117
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,580
Round One. Fight!

118
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:40,921
Round One begins.

119
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,890
Lee Gweon Suk versus Jo A Ra.

120
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,530
All right. Jo A Ra's movements
seem pretty light today.

121
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,830
It looks like Gweon Suk is studying
her opponent first, right?

122
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,530
Jo A Ra is doing a great job
of staying in rhythm.

123
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:01,311
She's jabbing. That's a right hook!

124
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:03,080
She landed a right hook.
That carried some weight.

125
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:05,481
Jo A Ra landed the first punch
to take the lead.

126
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,220
Jo A Ra is provoking her.

127
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,390
Gosh, Jo A Ra's footwork is great.

128
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,890
But why is Lee Gweon Suk
staying in one spot like that?

129
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,191
She's probably waiting.

130
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:20,431
Is that so?

131
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,160
Jo A Ra seems to be
in control of her movements.

132
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,830
She got Lee's face. Very good.

133
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,871
What was that?

134
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,510
Jo A Ra is a southpaw.

135
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,510
Did she change her style?

136
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,780
Did she become right-handed,
not left-handed?

137
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,981
Jo A Ra keeps on attacking her.
She's driving in the punches.

138
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,950
Left. Right.

139
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
A right hook.

140
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,590
It lands right in her face!

141
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:55,460
Gosh. Lee Gweon Suk
can't keep her head straight.

142
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,431
Is Gweon Suk flustered?
It landed right on her face.

143
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,001
Look at Jo A Ra's steps in the rhythm.

144
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:02,371
Calm down, Gweon Suk.

145
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:03,571
Stay focused.

146
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,941
Step to the side.

147
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:09,941
Her left hook was spot on!

148
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:12,640
Gosh, Gweon Suk must be anxious.

149
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,510
She can't even land a punch.

150
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,780
No, it's Jo A Ra who's anxious.

151
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:20,491
If she can't knock her out,
she'll end up getting tired first.

152
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,321
Gweon Suk is on a different level.

153
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:25,421
Jo A Ra knows that. That's why
she switched to her right hand.

154
00:08:30,731 --> 00:08:32,431
She keeps getting hit, though.

155
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:34,770
What are you doing, Gweon Suk?

156
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,941
Jo A Ra is unleashing
a barrage of punches.

157
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:38,941
- Gweon Suk, punch her!
- Gweon Suk.

158
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:40,271
Don't fall for that. Keep your hands up!

159
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,740
Stay focused.

160
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,480
You need to get out of there.

161
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:47,350
- That was the bell.
- Stop.

162
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:49,720
Stop.

163
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,291
- She can't cheat like that.
- Jo A Ra, you cheated!

164
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:00,661
Gosh, Jo A Ra is pretty worked up.

165
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:02,590
That wasn't good manners.

166
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:04,161
Are you okay?

167
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:06,671
To your corner.

168
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:08,970
This is a warning.

169
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,571
If you do this again, I'll deduct points.

170
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,041
To your corner.

171
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,171
- Jo A Ra.
- In a way, that's expected of her.

172
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:17,340
She seems proud even after her foul play.

173
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:18,681
- Jo A Ra!
- Jo A Ra!

174
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,311
- Jo A Ra!
- Jo A Ra!

175
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:21,911
- Jo A Ra!
- Jo A Ra!

176
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,620
- Jo A Ra!
- Jo A Ra!

177
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:25,281
- Jo A Ra!
- Suk.

178
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,791
- Jo A Ra!
- Jo A Ra!

179
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,590
Give me a cotton swab.

180
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,830
Suk. Don't get worked up
at Jo A Ra's play.

181
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,391
Her strategy is to get you angry.

182
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,730
Don't fall for that.
Wait until the end. Okay?

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,271
I'm scared of boxing.

184
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
But...

185
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:45,541
I will win today's game.

186
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:56,151
(Emperor Diet Boxing)

187
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,750
Fight!

188
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:07,130
Jo A Ra is showering her with punches
as soon as the second round begins.

189
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:08,161
Gweon Suk.

190
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,561
Don't let her land a punch on you.
You're Lee Gweon Suk!

191
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,571
Lee Gweon Suk delivered a right hook.
It landed right on her face.

192
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,041
Gosh, look at Jo A Ra.
I think it hit her pretty hard.

193
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,011
- That's it. Go for it, Gweon Suk.
- Go for it.

194
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:29,250
This is Lee Gweon Suk. Is the genius back?

195
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,250
Jab.

196
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:35,191
- All right. That's her chance.
- Let's go, Gweon Suk.

197
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:36,720
- Lee is bombarding her with punches.
- Two, three.

198
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,490
- Get out of there now!
- Great.

199
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,830
Gosh, she's clinching.

200
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,761
- Jo A Ra is clinching her. Yes.
- Break.

201
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,130
I bet she was flustered.

202
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:44,901
Fight!

203
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:46,460
The round has resumed.

204
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,240
Gosh, Lee Gweon Suk's gaze changed.

205
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:53,840
Keep your hands up.

206
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,011
She landed a powerful punch on Jo A Ra
as we speak.

207
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:01,110
Jo A Ra is staggering.

208
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
A punch to her body.

209
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,330
And a left hook. Her chin is exposed.

210
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:18,630
- Lee Gweon Suk!
- Lee Gweon Suk!

211
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,970
She's down!

212
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:36,281
Game over!

213
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,681
- The referee calls it.
- He calls the game!

214
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,291
- A knockout victory for Lee Gweon Suk!
- This is it!

215
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,391
It was the perfect victory!

216
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:44,661
The queen has returned!

217
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,360
- Lee Gweon Suk!
- Jo A Ra!

218
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,960
- Lee Gweon Suk!
- Hey.

219
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:50,860

- A Ra!
- Lee Gweon Suk!

240
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:32,200
- Hey.
- Oh, no. A Ra!

241
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,311
- No way.
- A Ra.

242
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:36,271
Congratulations.

243
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,710
- Thanks.
- Good work.

244
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:39,281
Thank you.

245
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:46,480
Kim, congratulations.

246
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,620
This worked out well, right?

247
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,051
We finally took our first step. Right?

248
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:52,120
Gosh, I was really nervous.

249
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,130
Look at her talent.
She won't be able to lose.

250
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,801
She's way too strong.
It's not even fair how strong she is.

251
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:57,901
Can you just leave?

252
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:00,431
Actually, we were just about to go out
and have some food and drinks.

253
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,931
It would be great
if you could swing by after this.

254
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:03,370
Why would I go there?

255
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,171
Right. You need to look after her. Okay.

256
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:07,271
Great work. I love it.

257
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:22,791
How's her wound?

258
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,860
Are the bones okay?

259
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,620
The pain's gone, so she'll be fine.

260
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,391
- We're ready.
- Oh, okay.

261
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:30,830
Let's go.

262
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,271
You'll pose for photos
and talk to the press.

263
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,330
Be prepared.

264
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,600
I'll go outside for a bit.

265
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,370
- Where to?
- I'll be right back.

266
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,110
Hey, Ms. Lee.

267
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,421
Where's she going?

268
00:13:53,421 --> 00:13:54,691
Can she be left alone?

269
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,791
- I'll go with her.
- Okay.

270
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,590
Don't be too long.

271
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,960
Let's not keep the reporters waiting!

272
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,261
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

273
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:10,671
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

You...

280
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,901
What are you doing? Why are you here?

281
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,311
I came to see...

282
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:23,941
if you were okay.

283
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,610
What?

284
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,720
You're so weird.

285
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:39,120
You hit me so that I wouldn't be okay.

286
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,791
If I didn't hit you,
you'd keep hitting me.

287
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Why can't I stand you?

288
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:55,041
Are you here to pity me?

289
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:58,681
How dare an athlete pity an opponent?

290
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,051
It's not anything like pity.

291
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:02,911
It's just...

292
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,090
a concern.

293
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,521
Who are you to be concerned?

294
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:12,261
Are you my mom? Or my coach?

295
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,830
Are you doing this to humiliate me?

296
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,301
It's not that.

297
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:21,401
As if it's not.

298
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:25,771
Sorry, but I'm not humiliated at all.

299
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,970
Because I gave it my all today.

300
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,311
Did you give it your all
in the ring today?

301
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,651
You didn't.

302
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:44,720
I knew it.

303
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,061
You weren't even pleased to win.

304
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,860
That was annoying.

305
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,340
I can't stand your face, so get lost.

306
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,340
I need to post that I'm fine.

You're still here?

308
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:09,011
I'll post your photo.

309
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:10,721
Get out.

310
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:32,501
Why did you come here?

311
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,511
That was bad of you.

312
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,340
You knocked her out.

313
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:41,551
It's impolite to comfort the loser.

314
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,251
She'll have felt incredibly insulted.

315
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,051
Stop it.

316
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:48,590

What about the interview?

321

We can skip it.

The reporters will chew me out.

00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:13,080
They'll write mean stuff about me.

324
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,380
I'll take care of that.

325
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:17,620
Today, let's not do what we don't want to.

326
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,180
What's gotten into you today?

327
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,291
You won.

328
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:26,690
It's only right for the winner
to revel in their victory.

329
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,971
Tae Young!

330
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,071
Why didn't you answer your phone?
I looked for you everywhere.

331
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,471
Ms. Lee wants you
and Gweon Suk back right now.

332
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,140
The reporters are going crazy.

333
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:50,380
I don't want to talk to the press.

334
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,951
Can we skip it?

335
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:54,991
Yes.

336
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,291
Tae Young! Gweon Suk!

337
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:00,221
Where are you going?

338
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:02,461
Ms. Lee will kill me
if I don't bring you back!

339
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:05,160
Tae Young! Gweon Suk!

340
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:06,501
Darn you!

341
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:09,067
Mr. Park.

342
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:11,714
Talk to the other reporters for me.

343
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:14,315
Okay, fine.

344
00:19:20,114 --> 00:19:21,884
You ran off with me...

345
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:23,525
only to buy me donuts?

346
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:25,255
Isn't this your favorite place?

347
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:27,124
Look.

348
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,194
I picked out the ones
with the most calories.

349
00:19:31,325 --> 00:19:33,934
Do you think I'm crazy for donuts?

350
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:47,575
Can I ask you something?

351
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:52,085
In the dressing room,
you said you were scared of boxing.

352
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:54,854
Why are you scared of boxing...

353
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:57,154
when you're the best in the country?

354
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:04,164
Mister.

355
00:20:05,265 --> 00:20:06,464
Have you...

356
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:10,934
given a friend an injury?

357
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:13,174
A friend?

358
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:16,174
No.

359
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:18,714
I have.

360
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:20,545
Focus!

361
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:23,384
You'll never kill your opponent like that.

362
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:26,815
Keep going until I say stop, okay?

363
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:28,384
Speed up!

364
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:30,325
Move faster!

365
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:36,164
Yeon Kyung...

366
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:38,735
was my closest friend at the gym.

367
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:40,565
My dad coached her too.

368
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:43,765
She was the first person...

369
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:46,104
I sparred with after I turned pro.

370
00:20:50,404 --> 00:20:52,714
We faced each other
for the first time without our headgear.

371
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,114
I suddenly felt scared.

372
00:21:01,315 --> 00:21:03,255
I thought if I didn't make her fall,

373
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:06,225
I could possibly end up dead.

374
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:14,265
Yeon Kyung, wake up.

375
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:16,035
- Call an ambulance.
- Okay.

376
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:19,005
Yeon Kyung, wake up!

377
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:21,204
Send an ambulance to Champion Boxing Gym.

378
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:23,005
Someone's down and unconscious.

379
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:25,644
Luckily, she woke up.

380
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:28,015
I'd ruptured her eardrum.

381
00:21:30,444 --> 00:21:33,614
Because of that injury,
she gave up trying for the title.

382
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:37,525
Even now, she can barely hear in one ear.

383
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:41,454
All athletes sustain
big and small injuries.

384
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:44,065
It's not your fault.

385
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:45,795
No.

386
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:49,235
I hurt her.

387
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:51,904
It wasn't even a real match.

388
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:55,345
I went berserk.

389
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:57,674
At the time,

390
00:21:59,745 --> 00:22:01,674
I was a monster, not a person.

391
00:22:03,845 --> 00:22:06,485
A monster who went berserk
whenever she went up to the ring.

392
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:11,285
My dad turned me into a monster.

393
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:16,424
Oh, hello. Welcome.

394
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:18,164
You can take this table.

395
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:19,735
We'll have two of those.

396
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:22,065
- To my dad,
- Two servings? What about soju?

397
00:22:22,065 --> 00:22:23,505
- I was a mere tool, not his daughter.
- No, we're good.

398
00:22:23,505 --> 00:22:24,505
Okay.

399
00:22:24,664 --> 00:22:26,035
A tool for achieving his ambitions.

400
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:27,204
One.

401
00:22:28,335 --> 00:22:30,444
- Clench your teeth! Two.
- That man...

402
00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:32,644
trained me inhumanely.

403
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:34,714
Get up.

404
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:35,944
Snap out of it!

405
00:22:35,944 --> 00:22:37,614
- He trained me like an animal.
- Get up at once!

406
00:22:37,614 --> 00:22:38,614
Honey!

407
00:22:39,154 --> 00:22:40,884
Honey! Why are you being like this?

408
00:22:40,884 --> 00:22:44,124
Please don't do this. Don't hit Gweon Suk.

409
00:22:44,124 --> 00:22:45,124
Step aside.

410
00:22:45,495 --> 00:22:46,854
The match is just around the corner.

411
00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:49,065
Is that match more important to you
than your own daughter?

412
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:50,325
Step aside before I lose it.

413
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:52,035
- Honey!
- I told you to step aside!

414
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:55,735
Mom, are you all right?

415
00:22:57,235 --> 00:22:58,235
Dad!

416
00:22:58,575 --> 00:22:59,575
Darn it.

417
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,674
To me, the boxing ring was...

418
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:08,045
the source of my misery.

419
00:23:09,785 --> 00:23:10,785
Even so,

420
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:14,485
I trained every single day without fail.

421
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:19,555
I thought if I quit boxing,

422
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:21,755
my mom could get hurt.

423
00:23:23,225 --> 00:23:24,525
That thought terrified me.

424
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,464
That's why you went into hiding...

425
00:23:30,765 --> 00:23:32,204
after your mother's funeral.

426
00:23:34,904 --> 00:23:37,144
I no longer had a reason to box.

427
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:41,045
My mom is no longer around.

428
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:44,614
Right.

429
00:23:48,825 --> 00:23:50,755
By the way, you were pretty cool earlier.

430
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:53,694
The last two punches were really nice.

431
00:23:53,694 --> 00:23:55,595
Punch! Bam! Pow!

432
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:58,065
"Punch?" Will you stop that?

433
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:00,464
I'm hungry.

434
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,335
This won't fill me up.

435
00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:21,654
(Champion Ox Bone Soup)

436
00:24:21,985 --> 00:24:23,184
This is an ox bone soup restaurant.

437
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:24,684
You said you wanted short rib soup.

438
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:26,495
Let's go somewhere else.
There are many good places here.

439
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:28,295
This restaurant is good too.

440
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:35,235
Hello!

441
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:40,434
You're here.

442
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:46,015
Hey, what is going on?

443
00:24:49,985 --> 00:24:52,884
Oh, I don't see short rib soup
on their menu.

444
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:54,255
Shall we go somewhere else?

445
00:24:54,354 --> 00:24:56,585
Wait. They'll make it for us
even if it's not on the menu.

446
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:01,495
That man is my dad.

447
00:25:02,225 --> 00:25:03,225
Oh!

448
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:06,495
Right. Lee Chul Yong.

449
00:25:07,495 --> 00:25:08,735
After a match,

450
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:10,664
I always crave short rib soup.

451
00:25:11,204 --> 00:25:12,404
It's my habit.

452
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:14,934
Whenever I had a match,

453
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:17,404
my dad always made short rib soup
and boiled pork for me.

454
00:25:28,315 --> 00:25:31,225
Hello, I'm Kim Tae Young.

455
00:25:32,025 --> 00:25:34,025
I'm Ms. Lee's agent.

456
00:25:36,095 --> 00:25:38,595
Congratulations
on winning the comeback match.

457
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:40,934
Yes.

458
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:42,735
Thank you.

459
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:51,144
My gosh. For some reason,
I wanted to cook short rib soup today.

460
00:25:51,874 --> 00:25:53,874
I put in all sorts of good stuff,

461
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,315
so finish the broth.
Don't leave a single drop.

462
00:25:57,414 --> 00:25:58,585
We offer free refills,

463
00:25:58,954 --> 00:26:00,315
so let me know if you need anything.

464
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:03,154
Okay. Leave us alone now, will you?

465
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:05,285
Let us eat.

466
00:26:06,424 --> 00:26:07,424
Okay.

467
00:26:08,124 --> 00:26:09,124
All right, then.

468
00:26:12,835 --> 00:26:13,835
We'll talk later.

469
00:26:31,114 --> 00:26:32,354
Meet me in the back. Right now.

470
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:37,555
Oh, I'll be right back.
I need to use the restroom.

471
00:26:46,335 --> 00:26:47,495
Gosh.

472
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:06,815
You little...

473
00:27:06,954 --> 00:27:07,954
That hurt.

474
00:27:07,954 --> 00:27:09,085
See?

475
00:27:09,624 --> 00:27:11,225
No one told you to punch me.

476
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:13,154
I bet you did this to Gweon Suk
all the time.

477
00:27:14,354 --> 00:27:17,194
You hit her and abused her,
using training as an excuse.

478
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:19,634
That's right. And I regret it now!

479
00:27:19,894 --> 00:27:22,704
You punk.
Must you rub salt into the wound?

480
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:25,065
Why did you bring Gweon Suk here?

481
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:27,075
I did not.

482
00:27:27,204 --> 00:27:28,575
She suggested we come here.

483
00:27:28,575 --> 00:27:30,174
Okay, but why?

484
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,674
She never once visited me for three years.

485
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:34,475
Don't tell me...

486
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:36,644
Did you tell her that I beat up that kid?

487
00:27:36,644 --> 00:27:37,644
Han Jae Min?

488
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:40,985
You little...
You'd better tell me the truth.

489
00:27:41,154 --> 00:27:42,485
Why would she come here, if not for that?

490
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:46,795
Thanks to me, you got to see your daughter
whom you missed. So just thank me.

491
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:49,765
You have trust issues, don't you?

492
00:27:51,694 --> 00:27:52,694
Gosh, I...

493
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:03,874
So you're a spy.

494
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:08,414
When I heard the way you said "punch,"

495
00:28:09,245 --> 00:28:10,384
I knew you were up to something.

496
00:28:12,214 --> 00:28:14,214
Since when
have you been following his orders?

497
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,325
"Orders?" What are you talking about?

498
00:28:16,924 --> 00:28:19,194
He came to see me.

499
00:28:19,194 --> 00:28:21,394
He said he couldn't bring himself
to meet you,

500
00:28:21,394 --> 00:28:23,295
so I've just been telling him
how you were doing.

501
00:28:23,624 --> 00:28:24,864
- Right, Mr. Lee?
- What?

502
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:27,995
Yes, that's right.

503
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:29,235
Dad, you stay out of this.

504
00:28:29,864 --> 00:28:31,005
He and I need to talk.

505
00:28:31,904 --> 00:28:34,434
Yes, all right.
I shall leave you two to talk.

506
00:28:34,634 --> 00:28:37,545
I'll go back inside
and pack some food for you.

507
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:40,075
Take your time and talk.

508
00:28:49,725 --> 00:28:51,384
What? Are you going to punch me?

509
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:54,654
Fine. If that will make you feel better,

510
00:28:55,225 --> 00:28:56,295
go ahead and punch me.

511
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,025
I'll let you punch me. Go for it.

512
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:11,904
I don't know what you
and my dad are cooking up together,

513
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:13,444
but don't betray me.

514
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:18,245
Please don't.

515
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,555
That won't happen.
Why are you even worried about that?

516
00:29:24,854 --> 00:29:26,495
Don't talk to me for a while.

517
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:29,295
I'll do things alone
until my anger goes away.

518
00:29:30,424 --> 00:29:32,025
If you think
that can make your anger go away...

519
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:33,934
Sure, do that.

520
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:39,475
I won't practice tomorrow.
Consider yourself informed.

521
00:29:39,634 --> 00:29:41,174
Why won't you practice?

522
00:29:41,174 --> 00:29:43,545
You said you'd give me a day off
after the match.

523
00:29:44,775 --> 00:29:46,345
You always forget these things.

524
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:54,214
Oh, this is...

525
00:30:00,854 --> 00:30:01,854
Hey.

526
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:04,095
Where's she going tomorrow?

527
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:06,164
How would I know?

528
00:30:06,164 --> 00:30:07,565
You must find out at all costs!

529
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:09,235
What am I, a stalker?

530
00:30:11,104 --> 00:30:13,134
Do not contact me for a while.

531
00:30:14,134 --> 00:30:15,745
Gosh.

532
00:30:16,345 --> 00:30:17,345
Hey.

533
00:30:17,704 --> 00:30:18,704
Hey!

534
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:20,345
Goodness.

535
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:41,765
Let's go.

536
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:42,765
Okay.

537
00:30:59,515 --> 00:31:00,614
I'm excited.

538
00:31:01,515 --> 00:31:02,624
We'll have fun.

539
00:31:26,414 --> 00:31:29,985
I never thought
we'd take a camping trip together.

540
00:31:31,644 --> 00:31:36,184
To be honest, I bad-mouthed you a little
with the other teachers.

541
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:37,854
I knew you were bad-mouthing me.

542
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,354
Really?

543
00:31:39,954 --> 00:31:41,725
I feigned ignorance
because I'm a nice guy.

(Bada Convenience Store)

546
00:31:58,644 --> 00:32:00,475
What will you do
if Gweon Suk goes berserk?

547
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:01,815
You know how she is.

548
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:03,644
She won't go berserk
if she's with that jerk.

549
00:32:04,144 --> 00:32:05,545
You know nothing about women.

550
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:07,755
Goodness. Hey, hurry.

551
00:32:09,124 --> 00:32:10,124
Fine.

552
00:32:10,354 --> 00:32:11,624
(Mongsampo Auto Campground)

553
00:32:11,624 --> 00:32:12,694
Get everything we need.

554
00:32:15,964 --> 00:32:17,325
I want to call you casually now.

555
00:32:18,124 --> 00:32:20,765
Should I call you Gweon Suk or Yu Ri?

556
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:22,864
Yu Ri, of course.

557
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:25,604
Then Gweon Suk it is.

558
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:27,434
What?

559
00:32:27,634 --> 00:32:29,704
If you already had an answer in mind,
why did you ask me?

560
00:32:29,874 --> 00:32:30,944
How about calling me Sweetie?

561
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:35,345
I don't like that.

562
00:32:36,545 --> 00:32:38,015
Call me Sweetie starting today.

563
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,585
Gosh, I didn't peg you
as such a cheesy guy.

564
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:45,285
Should I set up the tent now?

565
00:32:47,624 --> 00:32:48,624
Sweetie?

566
00:32:52,434 --> 00:32:53,495
Sounds good.

567
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:57,735
(Campground)

568
00:33:00,505 --> 00:33:02,174
See? What did I tell you?

569
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:03,874
I told you they would lend it to you
as long as you paid them.

570
00:33:04,174 --> 00:33:06,475
If there's a big supermarket,
we should swing by there.

571
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:08,674
I'm starting to get hungry.

572
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:25,525
Goodness. What a nice view.

573
00:33:29,864 --> 00:33:32,505
Gosh, I don't believe this.

574
00:33:32,735 --> 00:33:33,835
Look who's here.

575
00:33:34,475 --> 00:33:36,904
Gweon Suk is here.

576
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:39,745
What a small world.
I ran into my runaway daughter here.

577
00:33:40,874 --> 00:33:43,515
And there's a good-looking guy
I haven't met before.

578
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:48,684
Well, are you Gweon Suk's boyfriend?

579
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:50,124
- Yes.
- I see.

580
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,595
I'm Gweon Suk's father.

581
00:33:56,424 --> 00:33:57,525
I'm Han Jae Min.

582
00:33:58,364 --> 00:34:01,194
Don't mind us. Just enjoy your time
like you were doing before.

583
00:34:01,194 --> 00:34:03,704
We're here to hang out by ourselves too.

584
00:34:04,735 --> 00:34:05,805
She's just like me.

585
00:34:07,404 --> 00:34:09,035
What a coincidence this is.

586
00:34:16,084 --> 00:34:17,285
Gosh, come on.

587
00:34:18,245 --> 00:34:19,254
Don't mind them.

588
00:34:19,754 --> 00:34:21,254
You had to work hard to get a day off.

589
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:23,785
Let's just have fun today.

590
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:27,725
But still. They're crossing the line.

591
00:34:28,154 --> 00:34:29,794
How could they follow me here?

592
00:34:31,165 --> 00:34:32,694
They were probably worried.

593
00:34:32,694 --> 00:34:34,995
I'm fine. Just let them be.

594
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:54,754
By the way, what's this?

595
00:34:57,855 --> 00:34:59,524
Hey, that's a pop-up tent.

596
00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:01,555
Will you take all day to pitch the tent?

597
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:02,825
Haven't you learned anything
in the military?

598
00:35:03,765 --> 00:35:05,694
I served as a public service worker
on Line Seven.

599
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,334
Gosh, what a weakling.

600
00:35:07,334 --> 00:35:08,595
You know what? Your body says it all.

601
00:35:09,504 --> 00:35:10,705
Then what about you?

602
00:35:12,504 --> 00:35:13,504
I was exempted from it, you punk.

603
00:35:14,174 --> 00:35:15,234
I'm hungry.

604
00:35:15,234 --> 00:35:16,944
Let's eat first. You can do that later.

605
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:18,805
Gosh.

606
00:35:33,794 --> 00:35:35,055
Gosh!

607
00:35:35,794 --> 00:35:37,024
- That looks good.
- Yes.

608
00:35:40,035 --> 00:35:41,935
Gosh. Whatever.

609
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:43,805
Hey, I told you to buy some meat.

610
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:45,734
But you stubbornly didn't buy any.

611
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,134
Then we had to buy charcoal
and borrow a brazier.

612
00:35:49,134 --> 00:35:50,274
That doesn't cost much.

613
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:52,105
It's not about money.

614
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:54,745
- Why must I grill meat with you?
- This is great.

615
00:35:55,314 --> 00:35:56,384
Darn it.

616
00:36:06,095 --> 00:36:07,495
- Gosh.
- Is it good?

617
00:36:07,495 --> 00:36:09,464
- This is so good.
- Here.

618
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:20,274
Do you have any extra kimchi?

619
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:23,944
They sell kimchi at the snack bar.

620
00:36:24,345 --> 00:36:25,674
Go and buy it there if you want kimchi.

621
00:36:28,214 --> 00:36:29,214
We have a lot of kimchi.

622
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:31,484
Here.

623
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:35,515
It looks like you have extra utensils.

624
00:36:35,614 --> 00:36:37,185
Can you give me some utensils?

625
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:39,125
I can't use those wooden chopsticks.

626
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,395
You need two pairs, right?

627
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:51,004
Do you need anything else?

628
00:36:51,105 --> 00:36:52,364
Wait.

629
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:54,075
I'm thinking right now.

630
00:36:54,634 --> 00:36:56,375
Why are you doing that here?

631
00:36:57,075 --> 00:36:58,674
Even if you need more stuff, just go.

632
00:37:02,745 --> 00:37:04,814
Do you want to eat the meat with us,
Father?

633
00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:07,984
Hey, I'm not your father.

634
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,455
Hey, Kim Tae Young.

635
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:14,095
Bring ramyeon over here. Hurry up.

636
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:23,004
This is tasty.

637
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:26,105
Gosh. You see, pork belly is the best...

638
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:28,234
with kimchi.

639
00:37:28,234 --> 00:37:29,845
Hey, grill the onions too.

640
00:37:29,845 --> 00:37:31,145
- Sure. The onions.
- Here.

641
00:37:31,145 --> 00:37:33,114
If you want to eat that, you grill it.

642
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,044
Why are you bossing him around?

643
00:37:38,444 --> 00:37:40,814
Gosh. Please eat as much as you want, sir.

644
00:37:41,185 --> 00:37:42,415
Shall I then?

645
00:37:45,725 --> 00:37:47,754
- Hey, come and eat.
- Okay.

646
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:53,665
Gosh.

647
00:37:53,794 --> 00:37:55,265
You're eating meat thanks to me.

648
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:56,805
Gosh.

649
00:38:02,404 --> 00:38:03,475
Gosh.

650
00:38:04,145 --> 00:38:05,774
I won't be able to eat in good conscience.

651
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,345
- Give me that.
- No, I'll do it. It's okay.

652
00:38:08,345 --> 00:38:09,345
Give me that.

653
00:38:13,015 --> 00:38:14,015

What do you mean?

656
00:38:26,464 --> 00:38:28,864
Why would the promoter stop communicating?

657
00:38:29,564 --> 00:38:31,205
Did they send over
the medical checkup results?

658
00:38:32,504 --> 00:38:33,774
Then they won't call it off.

659
00:38:33,774 --> 00:38:35,805
Keep calling them. Okay.

(Coach's Office)

663
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:50,555
Hye Jin is going to spar with me today.

664
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:53,395
You can save 200 dollars
for the sparring match.

665
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:58,564
That doesn't cost much.

666
00:38:59,895 --> 00:39:03,105
Hey, let's have beef ribs
after our training later.

667
00:39:04,334 --> 00:39:06,064
Let's get Korean beef.

668

Sister Hye Jin!

669
00:39:14,774 --> 00:39:16,845
Let's go at it today. Let's do it!

670
00:39:18,845 --> 00:39:19,984
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

671
00:39:31,895 --> 00:39:33,464
Leave them. I'll take care of them.

672
00:39:34,134 --> 00:39:36,064
Gosh, I don't like free things.

673
00:39:36,064 --> 00:39:37,165
I should pay for the food somehow.

674
00:39:41,205 --> 00:39:42,274
Then I'll go with you.

675
00:40:00,924 --> 00:40:02,754
So you're not completely clueless.

676
00:40:03,665 --> 00:40:06,665
Agents don't usually follow athletes
on their days off, right?

677
00:40:09,364 --> 00:40:11,105
You know,
keeping tabs on athletes and so on.

678
00:40:12,265 --> 00:40:14,375
I don't keep tabs on anyone.

679
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:18,105
It wasn't my intention
to follow you guys today.

680
00:40:19,845 --> 00:40:20,944
That's good then.

681
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:23,915
But if you keep this up,

682
00:40:25,044 --> 00:40:26,555
it will be too much on Gweon Suk.

683
00:40:48,734 --> 00:40:50,044
Why are you following me?

684
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:55,745
Why are you pretending to be my dad?
It's annoying.

685
00:40:57,614 --> 00:40:58,785
Is it because you need money?

686
00:41:00,015 --> 00:41:01,384
Money, my foot.

687
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,125
I have more money than you.

688
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,625
Good for you. You got your wish.

689
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:11,825
You love money.

690
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:15,564
Even at Mom's funeral,

691
00:41:16,564 --> 00:41:18,464
all you talked about
was the match and money.

692
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:20,475
Is that why you left home?

693
00:41:22,435 --> 00:41:24,544
With Mom gone,
I don't have a home anymore.

694
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,845
What's going on between you
and that guy you came with?

695
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:31,384
Is it serious?

696
00:41:31,915 --> 00:41:33,254
Don't be nosy.

697
00:41:34,654 --> 00:41:35,685
It's my life.

698
00:41:36,484 --> 00:41:37,555
Kim Tae Young.

699
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:39,725
Is he trustworthy?

700
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:47,834
What do you mean?

701
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:50,705
I looked into him.
He has an awful reputation.

702
00:41:52,064 --> 00:41:54,334
Did you fall
for that jerk's silver tongue...

703
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:55,605
and sign some weird contract?

704
00:41:55,605 --> 00:41:56,674
What if I did?

705
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:58,904
What can you do about it?

706
00:41:59,004 --> 00:42:01,515
You... How much is the penalty?

707
00:42:02,015 --> 00:42:03,584
I'll pay it. Terminate the contract.

708
00:42:03,984 --> 00:42:05,015
Have you gone mad?

709
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,484
Why would I take money from you?

710
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:10,384
Don't you know that
our industry is full of vipers...

711
00:42:10,384 --> 00:42:11,984
looking for a chance to make a big score?

712
00:42:12,084 --> 00:42:14,995
Those jerks don't know
what it means to play fair, to begin with.

713
00:42:14,995 --> 00:42:18,125
Listen.
One small mistake could ruin your life.

714
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:20,035
You were that viper.

715
00:42:23,904 --> 00:42:26,105
My life is already ruined because of you.

716
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:33,475
Don't ever meddle in my life again.

717
00:42:35,814 --> 00:42:36,814
I warned you.

718
00:42:51,564 --> 00:42:53,495
Is this Hanwoo beef?

719
00:42:53,495 --> 00:42:55,035
It's a pig's front leg.

720
00:42:55,294 --> 00:42:57,234
- It has lots of fat.
- And it's cheap.

721
00:42:57,665 --> 00:42:59,105
It's from a domestic pig.

722
00:42:59,134 --> 00:43:00,134
My gosh.

723
00:43:00,705 --> 00:43:04,145
I can afford to buy you Hanwoo.

724
00:43:04,605 --> 00:43:06,044
Forget it, Coach.

725
00:43:06,174 --> 00:43:09,645
How could we dare make you buy us Hanwoo?

726
00:43:10,845 --> 00:43:13,455
If you chew on this and pretend it's beef,

727
00:43:13,455 --> 00:43:14,984
it really tastes like beef.

728
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:19,524
- Right? Doesn't it?
- It does.

729
00:43:19,524 --> 00:43:20,524
It's beef.

730
00:43:20,694 --> 00:43:21,694
It is.

731
00:43:22,055 --> 00:43:23,395
You two really...

732
00:43:23,864 --> 00:43:26,564
If you spend whatever you make right away,

733
00:43:26,564 --> 00:43:28,995
that's the surefire way to become poor.

734
00:43:29,495 --> 00:43:30,964
Right, sis?

735
00:43:30,964 --> 00:43:32,404
Right, sis.

736
00:43:34,504 --> 00:43:35,504
My gosh...

737
00:43:38,004 --> 00:43:40,345
Treat me to beef after I defend my title.

738
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:42,415
Okay?

739
00:43:44,314 --> 00:43:45,584
Okay, that's a deal.

740
00:43:46,245 --> 00:43:47,254
Let's eat.

741
00:43:49,455 --> 00:43:50,555
- Here.
- Thanks.

742
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,125
It's so pretty.

743
00:43:55,355 --> 00:43:56,355
Isn't it?

744
00:43:56,355 --> 00:43:57,964
Yes. I like it.

745
00:43:59,794 --> 00:44:00,794
No.

746
00:44:02,234 --> 00:44:03,234
It went out.

747
00:44:04,205 --> 00:44:05,205
That was fun.

748
00:44:10,174 --> 00:44:11,544
It was a long day, wasn't it?

749
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:17,314
Sorry. I ruined your day off.

750
00:44:17,314 --> 00:44:18,314
It wasn't ruined.

751
00:44:19,145 --> 00:44:20,154
We can do it again.

752
00:44:21,084 --> 00:44:22,415
After your next match,

753
00:44:22,714 --> 00:44:24,185
let's come back and stay longer.

754
00:44:25,285 --> 00:44:27,825
To celebrate us starting over.

755
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:29,924
"Starting over?"

756
00:44:34,995 --> 00:44:37,464
Okay. Let's come back.

757
00:44:38,504 --> 00:44:39,504
Let's.

758
00:44:50,785 --> 00:44:51,785
It's lovely.

759
00:45:15,935 --> 00:45:16,975
What did she say?

760
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:18,475
To not see you again.

761
00:45:18,845 --> 00:45:21,875
I won't tell you anything now.
Don't ask questions.

762
00:45:40,963 --> 00:45:41,963
Here.

763
00:45:43,262 --> 00:45:44,262
Your packed lunch.

764
00:45:44,863 --> 00:45:47,233
You must lose
all the weight you gained back.

765
00:45:48,702 --> 00:45:51,142
I can tell you gained at least two kilos.

766
00:45:52,843 --> 00:45:54,043
Okay, fine.

767
00:45:54,573 --> 00:45:55,573
Stop it.

768
00:45:59,142 --> 00:46:00,543
What was that about?

769
00:46:00,613 --> 00:46:01,613
The smell of sweat.

770
00:46:02,383 --> 00:46:04,312
Do you have just one sweat suit?

771
00:46:05,253 --> 00:46:07,653
I couldn't wash my clothes
because I was training.

772
00:46:10,193 --> 00:46:11,193
Gosh...

773
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:23,503
- Hello, Tae Young.
- Hi.

774
00:46:25,803 --> 00:46:26,872
What's all this?

775
00:46:27,343 --> 00:46:30,113
Gifts for Gweon Suk we got at the match.

776
00:46:30,912 --> 00:46:33,713
She got a lot of plushies
when she's not an ice skater.

777
00:46:34,242 --> 00:46:35,253
Did you have a good dream?

778
00:46:35,253 --> 00:46:36,653
I hope you had a lucky dream.

779
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:41,222
What are you doing? What's wrong?

780
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:49,892
What are you doing?

781
00:46:51,932 --> 00:46:52,932
Tae Young.

782
00:46:59,642 --> 00:47:01,073

(WBC Title 4th Defense Match, D-35)

787
00:47:41,383 --> 00:47:43,883
Ms. Han, I just heard the news.

788
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,153
What?

789
00:47:48,523 --> 00:47:49,892
That my defense match got canceled?

790
00:47:50,423 --> 00:47:53,293
Sorry. I should've found out sooner.

791
00:47:54,023 --> 00:47:55,032
My bad.

792
00:47:55,193 --> 00:47:57,193
Didn't you talk to my opponent?

793
00:47:57,363 --> 00:47:58,503
So I'd fight Gweon Suk?

794
00:47:59,032 --> 00:48:01,133
No, I swear it wasn't me.

795
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,803
I don't work like that.

796
00:48:03,573 --> 00:48:05,443
I'm looking into what happened.

797
00:48:06,073 --> 00:48:08,472
I'll tell you as soon as I find out.

(Giant Boxing)

801
00:48:38,102 --> 00:48:39,102
What's this?

802
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:42,843
The complete data
on Lee Gweon Suk's skills and stats.

803
00:48:44,242 --> 00:48:46,213
What are you up to?

804
00:48:46,512 --> 00:48:49,653
We have more information than we need
about Han Ah Reum,

805
00:48:49,912 --> 00:48:51,012
but you have nothing.

806
00:48:51,383 --> 00:48:53,753
Let's call it a handicap of sorts.

807
00:48:53,753 --> 00:48:54,753
You...

808
00:48:55,492 --> 00:48:57,423
Do you think that little
of Ah Reum and me?

809
00:48:57,553 --> 00:48:59,262
Did you get to her opponent?

810
00:48:59,693 --> 00:49:00,693
Yes.

811
00:49:01,062 --> 00:49:03,062
I set her up with another boxer.

812
00:49:03,062 --> 00:49:05,963
Did you get the Southeast Asian promoters
to back down too?

813
00:49:06,403 --> 00:49:09,332
- Was that your doing?
- I couldn't let you find a replacement.

814

I'll make it so you're left
with no one but Gweon Suk.

815

You evil punk.

816
00:49:15,472 --> 00:49:16,713
You called off the defense match,

817
00:49:16,943 --> 00:49:19,182
got the promoters to turn against us
and took our sponsors.

818
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:21,452
And then what? "Call it a handicap?"

819
00:49:22,113 --> 00:49:24,622
No human being
would do something like that.

820
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:29,492
I'm not human, you see.

821
00:49:29,492 --> 00:49:31,593
I don't need anything like this!

822
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:37,093
We can win a hundred times over
without your data.

823
00:49:37,093 --> 00:49:39,262
Then get Ah Reum
to fight and beat Gweon Suk.

824
00:49:39,762 --> 00:49:40,803
What?

825
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:42,673
I can't help it if you won't believe me,

826
00:49:43,503 --> 00:49:45,673
but all I want is for them
to put up a great fight.

827
00:49:45,872 --> 00:49:49,073
What kind of nonsense is that, moron?

828
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:51,682
I don't want a boxing industry
where Gweon Suk is the only survivor.

829
00:49:52,312 --> 00:49:53,582
For new stars to rise up,

830
00:49:53,582 --> 00:49:55,653
for people to pay to watch matches,

831
00:49:55,653 --> 00:49:56,653
and for their money...

832
00:49:57,613 --> 00:50:00,352
to gather to fund even bigger matches.

833
00:50:02,923 --> 00:50:05,693
Isn't that what you want
more desperately than I do?

834
00:50:06,762 --> 00:50:07,762
Am I wrong?

835
00:50:19,472 --> 00:50:20,472
Coach.

836
00:50:22,673 --> 00:50:24,213
You're struggling, aren't you?

837
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:28,253
You have a daughter to marry off.

838
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:31,053
- What?
- We'll foot the bill...

839
00:50:31,053 --> 00:50:33,082
for the title match.

840
00:50:40,262 --> 00:50:41,262
Gosh.

841
00:50:42,032 --> 00:50:43,762
There's quite a lot.

842
00:50:45,332 --> 00:50:47,762
They're from fans from the match.

843
00:50:49,573 --> 00:50:51,702
Suk, let's take a photo.

844
00:50:53,102 --> 00:50:54,102
Are you ready?

845
00:50:55,142 --> 00:50:56,742
One, two, three.

846
00:51:00,543 --> 00:51:01,952
(A hook at your heart!)

847
00:51:01,952 --> 00:51:03,312
Hey, Ms. Han.

848
00:51:04,053 --> 00:51:05,053
What are you doing here?

849
00:51:10,952 --> 00:51:12,492
What was that about?

850
00:51:15,332 --> 00:51:16,332
It's okay, Coach.

851
00:51:17,093 --> 00:51:18,133
She's here to see me.

852
00:51:18,133 --> 00:51:20,932
You can't get angry
because you know what you did to me.

853
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:23,003
If slapping me will make you feel better,
go ahead and slap me again.

854
00:51:23,003 --> 00:51:24,032
Really?

855
00:51:24,872 --> 00:51:26,073
Then let me slap you once more.

856
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:39,282
Your agent...

857
00:51:41,622 --> 00:51:43,153
got my defense match canceled...

858
00:51:44,492 --> 00:51:45,492
so I could fight you instead.

859
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:51,503
How could he cancel
my defense match twice?

860
00:51:54,972 --> 00:51:55,972
I didn't know.

861
00:51:58,003 --> 00:51:59,602
And I never thought
he'd do this on purpose.

862
00:51:59,972 --> 00:52:01,043
You didn't know?

863
00:52:02,843 --> 00:52:04,782
If you say you didn't know
with that angelic face, that's it?

864
00:52:05,812 --> 00:52:07,082
For the past three years,

865
00:52:07,443 --> 00:52:09,952
I have poured my heart and soul
into regaining that title.

866
00:52:11,282 --> 00:52:12,323
Who do you think you are?

867
00:52:14,483 --> 00:52:18,423
Why do I have to put up with this
because of a nobody like you? Why?

868
00:52:22,733 --> 00:52:24,032
Explain.

869
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:28,673
I can't.

870
00:52:29,372 --> 00:52:30,903
Just fight me, Ah Reum.

871
00:52:31,943 --> 00:52:33,003
What?

872
00:52:33,242 --> 00:52:35,073
That champion belt.

873
00:52:36,012 --> 00:52:37,543
I know how precious it is to you.

874
00:52:39,582 --> 00:52:40,983
So fight me.

875
00:52:41,682 --> 00:52:43,383
Fight me and win.

876
00:52:44,153 --> 00:52:45,852
Then you can keep your title.

877
00:52:47,182 --> 00:52:48,222
Hey.

878
00:52:49,992 --> 00:52:51,153
Don't be delusional.

879
00:52:51,963 --> 00:52:54,363
I refuse to fight you. Over my dead body!

880
00:52:56,392 --> 00:52:57,492
You're not a boxer.

881
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:02,872
So you don't have the right
to enter the ring.

882
00:53:36,903 --> 00:53:38,003
I heard about what happened.

883
00:53:39,872 --> 00:53:41,073
What did you hear?

884
00:53:42,713 --> 00:53:44,573
You mean, how I got in trouble...

885
00:53:44,812 --> 00:53:46,213
for your bad deed?

886
00:53:48,653 --> 00:53:50,653
I didn't know Ah Reum
would take it up with you.

887
00:53:51,553 --> 00:53:52,682
It is my fault.

888
00:53:53,852 --> 00:53:55,293
I'll make sure it won't happen again.

889
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,463
You don't need to apologize.

890
00:54:03,733 --> 00:54:06,303
You do bad things anyway.

891
00:54:07,363 --> 00:54:09,303
I was the one
who decided to join hands with you.

892
00:54:11,133 --> 00:54:12,202
But you see,

893
00:54:13,173 --> 00:54:14,912
can you at least do things properly?

894
00:54:15,972 --> 00:54:18,883
Make sure the match with Ah Reum
takes place no matter what.

895
00:54:20,282 --> 00:54:22,282
I don't want her to lose the title again.

896
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,523
I won't allow it.

897
00:54:48,843 --> 00:54:50,443
If you want to cry, eat while you cry.

898
00:54:50,742 --> 00:54:52,483
You can't afford to lose muscle mass.

899
00:54:55,883 --> 00:54:58,782
I talked to Ho Joong.
You'll train outdoors for a few days.

900
00:54:59,282 --> 00:55:00,553
Ho Joong will pick you up tomorrow.

901
00:55:11,162 --> 00:55:14,133
In any case, this is...

902
00:55:14,133 --> 00:55:15,832
That's what the agency wants.

903
00:55:16,303 --> 00:55:17,303
Who are those men?

904
00:55:20,573 --> 00:55:21,642
Mr. Kim.

905
00:55:25,142 --> 00:55:26,483
Hello.

906
00:55:26,812 --> 00:55:27,843
Hello.

907
00:55:29,312 --> 00:55:31,682
What are you waiting for, Mr. Kim?
Introduce me to them.

908
00:55:34,452 --> 00:55:36,823
This is my friend, Jung Soo Yeon.

909
00:55:38,662 --> 00:55:42,293
They're The Rumble Hunters'
sports managing directors.

910
00:55:42,293 --> 00:55:44,492
Eric Hahn and John Kim.

911
00:55:46,403 --> 00:55:50,273
He didn't tell you something important.

912
00:55:51,073 --> 00:55:52,742
We're not friends.

913
00:55:52,803 --> 00:55:54,903
We're rivals, you know.

914
00:55:55,812 --> 00:55:56,872
Rivals.

915
00:55:56,872 --> 00:55:59,082
Of course, I'm better than him.

916
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:02,883
Soo Yeon, you're funny.

917
00:56:04,553 --> 00:56:06,253
Your Korean is good.

918
00:56:07,622 --> 00:56:09,952
My English is even better.

919
00:56:13,722 --> 00:56:15,662
All right, then.
If you're done, let's get going.

920
00:56:15,662 --> 00:56:16,832
The car is here.

921
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:19,363
This way, please.

922
00:56:43,323 --> 00:56:44,753
When will Mr. Kim get here?

923
00:56:46,093 --> 00:56:47,593
I hope he doesn't come.

924
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,432
Hey, what are you saying?

925
00:56:49,992 --> 00:56:51,262
He's the one who's paying for us.

926
00:56:52,633 --> 00:56:55,273
He said he'd go to the office,
then come here. He'll be here soon.

927
00:56:56,403 --> 00:56:58,543
Everyone calls him the son of a witch.

928
00:56:59,803 --> 00:57:02,443
So why do you still work with him?

929
00:57:02,773 --> 00:57:04,142
Do you owe him something?

930
00:57:07,113 --> 00:57:08,782
I'm hugely indebted to him.

931
00:57:10,082 --> 00:57:11,153
I owe my life to him.

932
00:57:12,682 --> 00:57:14,852
He paid off my father's debt...

933
00:57:15,722 --> 00:57:17,293
and helped me open the boxing studio.

934
00:57:17,293 --> 00:57:19,593
- He did?
- He's like that.

935
00:57:20,392 --> 00:57:21,832
He's the real son of a witch,

936
00:57:22,032 --> 00:57:24,032
but he takes such good care
of his athletes.

937
00:57:24,162 --> 00:57:26,233
His athletes never have to starve.

938
00:57:26,903 --> 00:57:29,932
He makes sure they can earn a living
even after they retire.

939
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:33,173
No matter what anyone says,

940
00:57:34,503 --> 00:57:37,613
he's my lucky man.

941
00:57:38,642 --> 00:57:39,713
"Lucky man?"

942
00:57:42,213 --> 00:57:44,282
- Ho Joong.
- Hey!

943
00:57:45,182 --> 00:57:47,082
- Here, take these.
- Okay. Oh, my.

944
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:52,262
A sashimi platter?
My, we'll pig out today.

945
00:57:56,293 --> 00:57:58,503
So? Do you feel better now?

946
00:58:02,633 --> 00:58:03,633
Come with me.

947
00:58:05,303 --> 00:58:07,602
- Where are we going?
- Just come with me.

948
00:58:34,133 --> 00:58:35,133
What is this?

949
00:58:36,173 --> 00:58:37,673
Why did you buy me clothes?

950
00:58:37,832 --> 00:58:39,742
Did you think this would make me happy?

951
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:43,912
I bought them
so you could do laundry less often.

952
00:58:44,173 --> 00:58:46,043
You're complaining
that I bought you clothes?

953
00:58:47,883 --> 00:58:50,213
- You won't try them on?
- Why should I?

954
00:58:50,352 --> 00:58:52,452
I love my stinky clothes.

955
00:58:52,452 --> 00:58:54,823
Goodness. You sure hold a grudge.

956
00:58:58,323 --> 00:59:00,492
- Mister.
- Yes.

957
00:59:00,963 --> 00:59:03,193
Can I say whatever I want?

958
00:59:04,733 --> 00:59:05,733
Go for it.

959
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:08,832
You are...

960
00:59:13,773 --> 00:59:15,073
a real scumbag.

961
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,282
So you wanted to curse at me? Is that it?

962
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:26,383
And so am I.

963
00:59:30,193 --> 00:59:34,193
I wish I could blink and wake up
the day after the match.

964
00:59:36,992 --> 00:59:38,932
Then I wouldn't have to put up
with people bashing me,

965
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:41,463
and I wouldn't have to eat the lunchboxes
which I'm so sick of.

966
00:59:44,403 --> 00:59:46,472
So I just have one match left, right?

967
00:59:47,403 --> 00:59:49,642
That's it, right?

968
00:59:52,682 --> 00:59:54,912
You asked me to look into that company,

969
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:56,452
The Rumble Hunters.

970
00:59:57,452 --> 00:59:59,082
They're a new American sports promoter.

971
00:59:59,553 --> 01:00:02,553
I heard they were recruiting
all the rising sports stars overseas.

972
01:00:03,122 --> 01:00:04,193
Really?

973
01:00:05,587 --> 01:00:09,638
Then do you think
they helped Kim Tae Young...

974
01:00:09,662 --> 01:00:10,892
cancel Ah Reum's defense match?

975
01:00:10,992 --> 01:00:14,633
Well, it's definitely possible.

976
01:00:16,032 --> 01:00:18,173
I wonder what he used
to cut a deal with them.

977
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:21,403
They're not philanthropists.

978
01:00:21,403 --> 01:00:23,472
They must've wanted something in return.

979
01:00:24,443 --> 01:00:26,082
US debut, perhaps?

980
01:00:28,213 --> 01:00:29,312
The US?

981
01:00:30,012 --> 01:00:31,653
Just one more match,
and then I can retire.

982
01:00:34,852 --> 01:00:36,622
Why are you all quiet?

983
01:00:36,622 --> 01:00:37,852
You're making me nervous.

984
01:00:54,202 --> 01:00:56,073
What are you doing?

985
01:00:56,073 --> 01:00:57,742
What a scumbag would do in this situation.

986
01:00:57,742 --> 01:01:00,043
What? Have you lost your mind?
Why are you doing this?

987
01:01:00,043 --> 01:01:01,113
Have you lost your mind?

988
01:01:01,113 --> 01:01:03,782
Seriously! What are you doing?

989
01:01:03,782 --> 01:01:05,323
I said no! Put me down! Gosh.

990
01:01:05,323 --> 01:01:06,653
All right. Here we go.

991
01:01:06,653 --> 01:01:08,923
- No!
- One.

992
01:01:08,923 --> 01:01:10,053
- No!
- Two!

993
01:01:13,693 --> 01:01:14,992
My gosh! Seriously?

994
01:01:15,863 --> 01:01:17,463
What was that?

995
01:01:17,463 --> 01:01:19,863
We're at the beach. We should
at least get a taste of the ocean.

996
01:01:20,463 --> 01:01:21,733
Isn't that sweet?

997
01:01:21,733 --> 01:01:23,233
You come here.

998
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:25,233
Come here right now!

999
01:01:27,843 --> 01:01:29,273
They might have offered to help him...

1000
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:31,043
in exchange for
signing Lee Gweon Suk exclusively...

1001
01:01:31,043 --> 01:01:33,713
when she starts competing in the US.
Maybe, they had a deal like this.

1002
01:01:34,113 --> 01:01:36,883
To tell you the truth, it would be a waste
if she only stayed in Korea.

1003
01:01:37,253 --> 01:01:38,952
She could compete in the US...

1004
01:01:39,053 --> 01:01:40,923
to go after the titles
at the four major sanctioning bodies.

1005
01:01:41,352 --> 01:01:42,352
That's pretty cool.

1006
01:01:42,492 --> 01:01:44,423
But she'll have to beat Han Ah Reum first.

1007
01:01:45,323 --> 01:01:46,392
Who said we would let her?

1008
01:01:47,093 --> 01:01:49,193
I have a grand plan for Han Ah Reum.

1009
01:01:49,693 --> 01:01:52,662
Gosh, Korean boxing will be fun to watch.
It's been a while, you know.

1010
01:01:58,803 --> 01:02:00,073
Come here.

1011
01:02:06,443 --> 01:02:07,843
Gosh.

1012
01:02:15,053 --> 01:02:16,053
Go away.

1013
01:02:17,423 --> 01:02:18,423
No.

1014
01:02:20,593 --> 01:02:21,593
Hey.

1015
01:02:25,062 --> 01:02:26,062
I got you.

1016
01:02:30,202 --> 01:02:31,803
It's so cold.

1017
01:02:31,803 --> 01:02:32,803
Hold on.

1018
01:02:33,173 --> 01:02:35,043
Hey, stop it.

1019
01:02:40,312 --> 01:02:42,582
(My Lovely Boxer)

1020
01:03:04,303 --> 01:03:06,003
There really isn't anything
you want to try out?

1021
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:08,343
- What is it?
- It's none of your business.

1022
01:03:08,343 --> 01:03:09,943
Gosh, what is it?

1023
01:03:10,512 --> 01:03:12,543
Don't you want the champion belt?

1024
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:15,753
Some champions pick
weak opponents on purpose.

1025
01:03:15,753 --> 01:03:18,553
We're here to challenge Ms. Han Ah Reum.

1026
01:03:18,553 --> 01:03:21,452
Just tell her that
she doesn't have to do it.

1027
01:03:21,452 --> 01:03:23,722
Things with the athletes
aren't going as you planned, right?

1028
01:03:23,722 --> 01:03:24,852
What is this about?

1029
01:03:24,852 --> 01:03:26,122
The money for Ye Jun's treatment.

1030
01:03:26,593 --> 01:03:28,793
- The interest rate is pretty high.
- You got this!

1031
01:03:28,793 --> 01:03:32,602
If there's a way
to take care of this on your own,

1032
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:34,102
do you want to do that?

1033
01:03:34,363 --> 01:03:35,633
What are you looking at?

1034
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:38,403
Were you stunned by my beauty
all of a sudden?

1035
01:03:38,702 --> 01:03:40,543
There really isn't anything
you want to try out?

1036
01:03:41,142 --> 01:03:42,142
Kissing.

1037
01:03:42,512 --> 01:03:46,282
Have you ever asked a woman
to be in a relationship with you?

1038
01:03:47,142 --> 01:03:49,452
