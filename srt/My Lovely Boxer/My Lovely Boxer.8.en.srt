("When one door closes, another opens."
Spanish proverb)

2
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,260
How is Tae Young?

3
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,800
I feel bad asking how he's holding up
when I just left him in your hands.

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,740
We'll talk later.

5
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:48,789
I'm heading out to do roadwork with Coach.

6
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,180
Just call me Mr. Kim.

7
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,150
You said he'd be the starter
in the next game. Was this what it meant?

8
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,579
Score rigging?

9
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,689
Let's go for 1 IP, 2 BB. Simple, right?

10
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,359
The club is talking
about ousting Kim Hee Won.

11
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,030
Hee Won. You should retire.

12
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,159
My son's sick, you scumbag!

13
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,500
Next year, how many wins do you want?

14
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Kim Hee Won was found dead
at his residence in Taiwan.

15
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,810
I believe...

16
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,140
a three-page suicide note was found
at the scene.

17
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:55,150
If you make porridge, will he eat it?

18
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,459
He'll eat a little,
enough to keep him alive.

19
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:58,859
(Episode 8)

20
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,530
- Can you taste this?
- Sure.

21
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,669
Gosh, it tastes awful.
What if he doesn't even touch it?

22
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:14,039
Just order some and get it delivered.

23
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,210
Gosh, seriously.

24
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,939
What? Who could it be?

25
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,580
Hello.

26
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,719
Yes, hello.
You can't be having a great day.

27
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,900
- You're here too.
- Oh, hello.

28
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,229
Where is Tae Young?

29
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,229
He's still in his room.

30
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,469
He won't come out.
He even locked the door.

31
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,810
- For three days?
- Yes.

32
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,340
Are you here because he has missed work?

33
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,180
No, the team manager took care of that.

34
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,349
Mr. Kim Hee Won's body...

35
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:01,250
arrived from Taiwan early this morning.

36
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,259
It arrived today?

37
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,090
Mister.

38
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,259
Tae Young.

39
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,900
Tae Young.

40
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,939
The team manager said
not to attend the funeral.

41
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,270
You shouldn't come.

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,310
Step aside, Sun Jae.

43
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,740
Tae Young.

44
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,810
Step aside.

45
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,319
Wait, Tae Young. Shoot.

46
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,550
Tae Young, stop!

47
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,090
Gweon Suk, he's not in his right mind.

48
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,289
He didn't even put on his shoes.

49
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,949
Mister.

50
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,449
Thanks.

51
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,230
You shouldn't drive, mister.

52
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,170
I called a taxi.

53
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,699
I'll come with you.

54
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,810
Let me tag along
and say my goodbyes. Please?

55
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,740
No, don't come.

56
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,560
(Funeral Hall)

57
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,329
Yes, all right.

58
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,800
You should go back to the office. Okay.

59
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,600
I think he's cabbing here.

60
00:04:58,769 --> 00:04:59,800
He'll be here shortly.

61
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,970
Oh, team managers.

62
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:06,310
My gosh, Reporter Park.
Did you have breakfast?

63
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,279
When did you get here?

64
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,680
Let's go have our morning coffee.

65
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,079
- I have to wait here.
- No, you don't. Come on.

66
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,550
What is it?

67
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,790
- Wait, I...
- Come on.

68
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,560
(Funeral Hall)

69
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,930
Let go.

70
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,839
No, you can't go in there.

71
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,310
Go home.

72
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,240
I heard Hee Won died.

73
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:38,540
He's dead, and that's why he's here.

74
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,149
- I must check with my own eyes.
- Tae Young.

75
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:45,620
I must see it with my own two eyes,
or I won't believe it.

76
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,220
I mean, why?

77
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,459
Hee Won had no reason to die,
so why did this happen?

78
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,230
He was pressured to partake in
match fixing until the day before he died.

79
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,889
A reporter I know told me.

80
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,560
Until the day before he died?

81
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Why?

82
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,269
I don't know.

83
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,370
Do you know anything about it?

84
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,439
The guys are coming back
to the baseball games.

85
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,649
I saw Kim Hee Won
before he left for Taiwan.

86
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,350
He was with men I'd never seen before.

87
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,550
Why do you think the reporters are here?

88
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:23,449
Because Kim Hee Won died?

89
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,389
They want to know
who's behind the match fixing scandal.

90
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,699
They're camping out here,
hoping to get the person on camera.

91
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,800
They're all waiting for you now.

92
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,629
They say there's no way you didn't know.

93
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,170
They all suspect you.

94
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,470
Do you want to get roped into this?

95
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,339
I don't care. I'm going in.

96
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,870
No, you can't.

97
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,939
I care.

98
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,050
This could ruin our match too.

99
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,620
Try to think about
how Hee Won must've felt.

100

(Our Deepest Condolences)

101
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,759
In Hee Won's suicide note,

102
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,300
your name wasn't mentioned.

103
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,839
Your idol, Hee Won,

104
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,839
didn't even leave any messages for you.

105
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,879
Why do you think that is?

106
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,579
He didn't want you to get suspected.
Not even for a second.

107
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,120
He did everything he could to protect you.

(Funeral Hall)

111
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Go inside.

113
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,949

(Paran Tour)

116
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,820
Who are you calling?

117
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,350
Your ex-boyfriend?

118
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,919
What?

119
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,059
I bet you're heartbroken
and miss him dearly.

120
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,570
It's obvious you're calling your ex
from the look on your face.

121
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,940
You're wrong.

122
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:01,169
I was calling my agent.

123
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Is that so?

124
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,210
My hunch is mostly spot on.

125
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,220
I don't think so.

126
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,720
He hasn't been coming by for a few days.

127
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:22,659
And you've been glued
to your phone all day.

128
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,730
Because something happened to him.

129
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,940
What are you doing?

130
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:41,379
Gosh. I swear there's something going on.

131
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,450
Do you like him? Yes?

132
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,750
Do you think about him?

133
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,419
No!

134
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,159
What?

135
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,590
It looks like you do
when you look so serious like that.

136
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,200
I'll root for you.

137
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:01,929
Gosh.

138
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,809

(That guy)

140
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,950
According to Kim Hee Won's suicide note,

141
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,789
match fixing had secretly been conducted,

142
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,960
centered around less popular
baseball teams in the professional league.

143
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,759
However, he didn't single out any games
or any individuals...

144
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,299
who participated in match fixing.

145
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:10,230
The police's priority will be confirming
the validity of the suicide note...

146
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,539
as they proceed with the investigation.

147
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,580
Mister?

148
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,750
Mister.

149
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,460
Mister.

150
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,360
I woke you up, didn't I?

151
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,330
Sorry.

152
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,759
I wasn't sleeping.

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,929
Why didn't you come in?
Why did you leave right away?

154
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,240
I was walking and just ended up here.

155
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,639
Go back inside and get some sleep.
I'll go to Ho Joong's house.

156
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,879
You're not going anywhere
in that condition.

157
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:55,679
Just come inside.

158
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,580
But it's uncomfortable for you.

159
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,850
It's not.

160
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,549
Besides, this is your house.

161
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:09,889
Stay here for the time being.

162
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,370
You didn't eat all day, right?

163
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,710
Wash up and have a meal first.

164
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,220
That way, you'll have some energy.

165
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:52,899
Mister.

166
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,950
- Mister.
- Stay there.

167
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:46,059
Don't come near me.

168
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,429
You'll get hurt.

169
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,970
Show me your fighting spirit.

170
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:07,970
Do a winning pose.

171
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,409
Let's take another one
with a different gaze.

172
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,279
Great.

173
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:16,850
Look more confident.

174
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:20,419
Excellent.

175
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,320
Maybe, we should have brought
your gold medal from the Olympics.

176
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,789
Right. Should I go and get it now?

177
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,129
Should we?

178
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,759
That's fine.

179
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:34,259
That makes me look more pathetic.

180
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,570
Hey, Suk.

181
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,570
Cheer up a bit. Okay?

182
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,299
You can't look like that
in front of a camera.

183
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:41,769
Look at Han Ah Reum.

184
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,470
She has the aura of a champion.

185
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,779
I have no energy.
What do you expect me to do?

186
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,480
I wonder if he's okay.

187
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,980
He broke all the picture frames
of his athletes yesterday.

188
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
What?

189
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,750
What about my picture?

190
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,759
Gosh, that's one of my best photos.

191
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Seriously, coach?

192
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,059
I was trying to make you smile a bit.

193
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,630
He's not that weak.

194
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,200
I'll get him to leave after training.

195
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,640
No, leave him alone.

196
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,339
He'll prefer being in his own room.

197
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,339
Ms. Lee, they're ready for you.

198
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,490
She looks pretty good.

199
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:30,950
Clench your fist.

200
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:34,190
Glare at your opponent.

201
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,890
Give us another confident pose.

202
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,769
Look over here.

203
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:43,130
Nice.

204
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,670
See you next time.

205
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,069
Shall we get something to eat?

206
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,180
Ms. Lee.

207
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,559
I think you two should try to get closer.

208
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,759
There are so few female boxers.

209
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,230
Why did you call me over?

210
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,769
Ho Joong told me...

211
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,410
that Tae Young was at home.

212
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,079
Tae Young and Hee Won.

213
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,480
They were as tight as brothers.

214
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,450
No one can imagine
what he's going through.

215
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,890
Yes. I heard.

216
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,420
Call if he becomes too much to handle.

217
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,329
Who knows? I might be able to help.

218
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,930
- I'll do that.
- Bye, then.

219
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:50,799
See you.

220
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,049
This brings back old memories.

221
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:07,250
You don't have a photo of Ms. Lee
on the wall.

222
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,200
Tae Young was a moping mess
after they broke up.

223
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,430
Call if he becomes too much to handle.

224
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,700
Who knows? I might be able to help.

225
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,819
- My dear, lunch is here.
- What?

226
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,690
It'll be so good.

227
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,690
Lunch?

228
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,819
I didn't order anything.

229
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,529
Sir.

230
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:34,170
Stop following me around.

231
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,440
What are you even doing here?

232
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,839
I brought some short rib soup.

233
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,509
- What?
- Tae Young ordered some.

234
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,710
Ask him if you don't believe me.

235
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,450
You should learn when not to lie.

236
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,250
You don't know anything.

237
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,450
I know everything.

238
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,059
The baseball player.
Tae Young was his agent.

239
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,789
I hear stuff too.

240
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,500
How's he doing these days?

241
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,299
Did you get that close
after spending time together?

242
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,670
He's barely surviving.

243
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,880
Will that be a problem with your match?

244
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:14,140
Don't mention my match.

245
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,410
I don't want to discuss boxing with you.

246
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,589
Take some of the soup to Tae Young.

247
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,390
- I added lots of good...
- I know that.

248
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,259
Don't bother to show off.

249
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,029
And don't come here again.

250
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,640
I ordered whatever I thought you'd like.

251
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,750
This tea's supposed to calm you down.

252
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,750
Thanks.

253
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:57,150
I'm sorry to bother you
when you must be busy.

254
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,690
Are you here
because you can't reach Tae Young?

255
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,089
I'm glad you came.

256
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:03,730
The news is full of terrible details.

257
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The boys practically grew up together.

258
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,400
If I feel this dreadful,
Tae Young must feel worse.

259
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,509
If you're that worried,
shall I take you to see him?

260
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:19,809
No. My visit
will only make him feel worse.

261
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,480
I should get back.

262
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,380
I asked someone to watch my store.

263
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,549
Share this with your colleagues.

264
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,359
Mother. I'll tell Tae Young to call you.

265
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
Don't.

266
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:42,299
Okay. Thanks.

267
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,410
(Ms. Lee Gweon Suk)

268
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,250
Ms. Lee. Is something wrong?

269
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,750
Sorry to bother you when you must be busy.

270
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,150
It's fine.

271
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,430
Were you alone all this time?

272
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:11,390
No.

273
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,700
My coach was here,

274
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,299
and he offered to stay,
but he wasn't much help.

275
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:19,400
Where's Tae Young?

276
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,609
In his room.

277
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,440
He won't come out...

278
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,740
or answer when I call.

279
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:28,809
Does he eat?

280
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,279
He seems to come out for a while
when I'm in bed.

281
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,049
He has barely eaten in the past few days.

282
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,799
This is from his mother.

283
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
Share it with him.

284
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:53,799
It's tough, isn't it?

285
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,480
I just don't know what to do,

286
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:02,880
so I called you.

287
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:05,650
Good for you.

288
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,019
First,

289
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:12,990
shall we break in?

290
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,359
Tae Young, I'm coming in.

291
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,259
Tae Young.

292
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,940
Oh! Ma'am.

293
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:16,549
I didn't expect to run into you here.

294
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,160
Where's your boyfriend?
Why are you alone today?

295
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,359
He's not my boyfriend.

296
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,160
When he was running with you,

297
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,630
you looked so excited,

298
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,130
so I totally assumed
that he was your boyfriend.

299
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,339
How did I look
when I was running by myself?

300
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:43,970
You looked like you were forcing yourself
to do homework that you didn't want to do.

301
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,180
I see.

302
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,579
That was the vibe I gave off.

303
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
Did you guys fight?

304
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,059
No, we didn't.

305
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,160
But he's going through
a really hard time right now.

306
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
I see.

307
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,569
I didn't know this in the past,

308
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:14,000
but he's done so much for me.

309
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,640
So knowing that he's having a hard time,

310
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:20,279
I want to do something for him too.

311
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,009
But I'm still young,

312
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,180
and there's nothing I can do.

313
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,049
I'm sure there's something.

314
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:34,289
Look at me. I take her out for a walk
every single day.

315
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:37,660
I'm not sure whether or not
she really wants this,

316
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,500
but what can you do?

317
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,829
As long as he doesn't say no,

318
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,740
do everything you can. Just go for it.

319
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,740
So I should find out what I can do?

320
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,670
- Yes.
- And go for it?

321
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,170
- That's right.
- Just go for it?

322
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,180
Yes, just do it.

323
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Okay.

324
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:56,349
Just do it.

325
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,910
Yes, that's right.

326
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:03,420
(Lee Gweon Suk)

327
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,259
Mr. Kim Tae Young, are you inside?

328
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,799
Mister!

329
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:23,509
Mister, wake up already.

330
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,539
Do you know
how many times I've called you?

331
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:31,079
Gosh. What are you doing?

332
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,420
Get up already.

333
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,650
The sun's high up in the sky. Come on.

334
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,619
Leave me alone, will you?

335
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:37,789
You wish.

336
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,259
Get up already.

337
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,230
How much longer will you hide like this?

338
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:48,029
Can you please just leave me alone?

339
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Let's go.

340
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,140
I'll take you there.

341
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,309
Where do you want to go?

342
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,210
You asked for my help,
saying you'd help me too.

343
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,680
I'll help you.

344
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,319
So you should help me too.

345
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,819
It's my turn to help you.

346
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:15,329
That pledge in the rain.

347
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,730
Have you forgotten all about it?

348
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,559
It was freezing cold that day.

349
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,480
Hey, what are you doing?

350
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,079
I'm copying you.

351
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,650
What?

352
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:39,920
The things you did for me.

353
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:41,920
I'm returning exactly what I've received.

354
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:44,519
That's what I've been doing
this whole time.

355
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:46,089
You couldn't tell?

356
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,190
"Let's go back to the ring."

357
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,759
"I'll get you the biggest match ever."

358
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:58,369
Sweat it out.

359
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,170
We've been living as if we were dead.

360
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,309
I can't box.

361
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:06,009
I know. Your face screams that
you don't know a thing about boxing.

362
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,079
I'm a pretty good boxer, you see.

363
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,079
I'm only allowed to throw left jabs,

364
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:16,990
while you're really going to box.

365
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,390
Okay?

366
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:20,789
All right.

367
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,099
Go.

368
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,380
Hurry up and come at me.

369
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,579
I'll keep throwing jabs
until you start moving.

370
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,859
Do you remember what I said
about the most important thing in boxing?

371
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,230
It's how you stand.

372
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,730
Stand firmly.

373
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,170
Stand like a big tree,

374
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,299
and keep your movements light.

375
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:10,009
Guard up. Your guard.

376
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,839
Guard up.

377
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,250
That ruined your stance.

378
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,319
Plant both feet firmly on the floor.

379
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,420
Throw a punch
with all the anger inside you.

380
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,039
Don't take your eyes off me.

381
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,339
Look at me.

382
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,470
Watch for a chance to attack.

383
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,210
Are you already getting tired?

384
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,740
Go ahead and punch me.

385
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:50,049
With all the anger inside you.

386
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
Guard up.

387
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,450
Don't drop your guard. Guard up.

388
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:58,990
Guard up.

389
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Your guard.

390
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,130
Gosh.

391
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
Darn it!

392
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,579
(A hook at your heart!)

393
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,559
That was good.

394
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,000
This is ridiculous.

395
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,140
You know,

396
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:33,220
I boxed once while hiding...

397
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,490
because I was so frustrated...

398
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,819
and wanted to cry.

399
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:43,829
Back then,

400
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,460
I had totally forgotten how to cry.

401
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,799
My dad didn't let me cry
from a very young age.

402
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,869
He hit me when I cried.

403
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:06,420
Even when my mom died,
I couldn't cry as much as I wanted.

404
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,059
I felt like
something was blocking my heart.

405
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,789
I had made the decision to run away
but didn't know what to do.

406
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,059
So I rented a boxing ring.

407
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:24,869
Funny, right?

408
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,269
It was the only thing I knew how to do.

409
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,780
Once back in the ring,

410
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,320
it finally hit me that I'd lost my mom,

411
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,190
and I burst into tears.

412
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,369
Someone who was dear to you
has passed away.

413
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,840
It's okay to cry in front of me, mister.

414
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,210
You're heartbroken and devastated.

415
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:08,849
You can tell me everything.

416
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,750
I'm all ears.

417
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,349
I'm struggling to breathe.

418
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,889
I can't breathe.

419
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,570
I don't remember how his face looked...

420
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,679
back in the days when things were good.

421
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,019
I only remember seeing him walk away...

422
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:50,949
from behind...

423
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,960
the day I told him to retire.

424
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,630
Hee Won.

425
00:35:58,789 --> 00:35:59,800
I thought...

426
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:03,130
I thought I was protecting Hee Won.

427
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:05,539
But I wasn't.

428
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:10,710
I was wrong.

429
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,409
Hee Won was the one...

430
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,210
protecting me.

431
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:22,320
He kept waiting for me...

432
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,519
and talking to me.

433
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,389
But I didn't know.

434
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,900
I didn't even listen.

435
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,769
I...

436
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,539
I was just a coward.

437
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,110
I was shortsighted.

438
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,920
I really was the son of a witch.

439

("Kim Hee Won,
the Only Accomplice to Match Fixing?")

("Kim Hee Won,

441
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:30,250
(Requesting to publish corrected articles
about Kim Hee Won)

442
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,150
Don't just stand there. Take it.

443
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,219
Mister.

444
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:14,989
Gosh, just take it already.

445
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,400
Are you touched?

446
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:27,199
You were supposed to tell me
if you were going out.

447
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,539
What am I? A kid?

448
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:30,840
Were you worried
something might have happened to me?

449
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,710
That I might stay in my room forever?

450
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,619
What's this?

451
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,679
What do you think? It's chicken breast.

452
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:45,289
I didn't have the time to make
your meal today, so I bought it.

453
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:47,420
You're really back.

454
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,530
It's chicken again.

455
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,590
So what? Do you not want it?

456
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,559
Thank you.

457
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,170
Not for the chicken.

458
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,210
Aren't you tired?

459
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,210
Running again after a break can be tough.

460
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,050
I told you to ride the bicycle instead.

461
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,280
I wanted to go for a run.

462
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:19,090
When you beat me up yesterday,

463
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,159
I finally got a grip.

464
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,659
It's nice to run after a while.

465
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,030
You seem to be in a good mood.

466
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,269
Really?

467
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,340
Well, I am actually in a good mood.

468
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:37,409
When I first started running...
How should I put it?

469
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,139
It felt like I was doing homework
I didn't want to do.

470
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:42,710
But after I started running with you,

471
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,920
I guess it looked like I was having fun.

472
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:50,050
What do you mean?
It looked like you were having fun?

473
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,250
If you're having fun, then that's it.

474
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,260
I was just telling you
what the old man with the candy told me.

475
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,860
Gosh, when did you guys talk about that?

476
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,400
You know what? That's what I do.

477
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,530
I cheer people up.

478
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:07,000
You cheer people up?
Let's not give yourself too much credit.

479
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,210
What else did he say?

480
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:11,269
Well, he said...

481
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,280
When he was running with you,
you looked so excited,

482
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,380
so I totally assumed
that he was your boyfriend.

483
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,579
I can't tell you.

484
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,650
What is it?

485
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,150
Stop.

486
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,019
You're doing that again.

487
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:29,159
What ridiculous thing
is on your mind this time?

488
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,630
That's enough. Forget it.

489
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,230
I'll get going first.

490
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,030
Gosh.

491
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,619
(Kim Tae Young)

492
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,559
Yes, Kim.

493
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,690
How are you feeling?

494
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:04,329
I'm at Giant Boxing.

495
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,960
What?

496
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:38,159
What's wrong with her?

497
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,599
She's not feeling well.

498
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:44,099
Or did I finally become a decent boxer?

499
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:48,269
Gosh, I'm too good of a boxer.

500
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,269
Too bad my retirement
is around the corner.

501
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:53,039
Hey, Hye Jin.

502
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:56,349
Once Ah Reum is done with her match,

503
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:58,780
- I'll make sure to get you...
- She said I would get a bonus match.

504
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,280
A bonus match? What do you mean?

505
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,849
Did she not tell you yet?

506
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,889
Ah Reum's agent said
she would book me a match too.

507
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,530
You know that a good bonus game
can be as feisty as the main game, right?

508
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,300
I'll get you another Korean champion belt.

509
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:16,000
Sure. Deal.

510
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:29,679
Ah Reum, are you all right?

511
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,280
You haven't been feeling well.

512
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,719
Everything is good, right?

513
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,250
Gosh.

514
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,760
Did I make you worry?

515
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,519
I'm fine.

516
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,989
I watched dramas all night yesterday.
That's why.

517
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:48,099
I can't stop watching the series
once I start.

518
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,969
You must have gone mad.

519
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:59,340
You're going to take a break?
This is the season for free agents.

520
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,780
With me out of the game,
it'll be good for you.

521
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:02,210
You have one less man to beat.

522
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,550
Why do you have to put it like that?

523
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,010
What about our match?

524
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,679
You'll see it through, right?

525
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,849
I'll hand over everything to Sun Jae.

526
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:13,659
Hey, you're the reason
I got involved in this whole thing.

527
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,230
Does Ms. Lee know about your decision?

528
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Not yet.

529
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:26,869
Is this your way of dumping me?

530
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,199
Dump you?

531
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,309
I told you I wanted
to give us another shot if I won.

532
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:35,710
You told me to do my best.

533
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,150
I was going to do my best.
And look at you, running away.

534
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:39,550
Hey, that's...

535
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,650
There is one more reason
I shouldn't be involved in this match.

536
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,019
Get back inside. Bye.

537
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:50,889
(Giant Boxing)

538
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:08,780
(I'm informing you that
I cannot publish any corrections.)

539
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,349
(I cannot publish any corrections.
I'm sorry.)

540
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:13,420
(There isn't enough evidence
to warrant a correction.)

541
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,500
Jab.

542
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:27,829
One, two, three, top.

543
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,429
And pass.

544
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,730
Jab.

545
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,900
Uppercut.

546
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:38,840
Hey, mister.

547
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:40,309
Tae Young.

548
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,980
Gosh.

549
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,550
What's the occasion?

550
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:45,510
You couldn't be bothered to come.

551
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,349
It's great to see you.

552
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:49,179
Right, Coach?

553
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:50,349
Yes.

554
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:52,889
Ho Joong, let's talk.

555
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,659
- Okay.
- Okay.

556
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,130
You stay and practice.

557
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:02,159
You stay and practice.

558
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,230
Darn you.

559
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:11,340
What did you and Coach talk about?

560
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,179
You left me out.

561
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:16,349
Don't ask. You'll only get hurt.

562
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,949
See, I knew you'd say that.

563
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,650
What are you planning now?

564
00:46:22,889 --> 00:46:23,949
Are you...

565
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,690
going back into your hole?

566
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:29,159
It's not that.

567
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,059
Why have you been like this?

568
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,960
What was I like?

569
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,329
You were fine in the morning,

570
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,940
but then you turned gruff.

571
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,500
You won't talk to me...

572
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,940
or even look at me.

573
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,510
Do I have to look at you?

574
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,110
Did I say that?

575
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,679
It just looks like
you're avoiding my gaze.

576
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,519
You won't smile either.

577
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,619
I have nothing to smile about.

578
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:03,559
Don't.

579
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,190
You smiled.

580
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:07,130
That's so childish.

581
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,039
Hi.

582
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:14,599
You look great together.

583
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,800
I couldn't help it.

584
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:17,469
Go on home.

585
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:19,780
I'll go to Ho Joong's.

586
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,340
Okay.

587
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,820
Hey.

588
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:31,750
What's going on?

589
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,360
What is it?

590
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,699
I get the feeling
I saw something I shouldn't have.

591
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,869
Did you shack up with Lee Gweon Suk?

592
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:48,369
I let her stay at my place...

593
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,039
while I stayed with my junior.

594
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,309
You seemed to get along.

595
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,280
I guess you adore Lee Gweon Suk.

596
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,449
I do adore her. She's a talented boxer.

597
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:02,949
Why are you here anyway?

598
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:05,789
You sent out an email...

599
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:08,059
asking us to correct
our article on Hee Won.

600
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,690
You got shot down, didn't you?

601
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,360
I'll write something for you.

602
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:17,199
We have something special.

603
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:20,869
What do you want?

604
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:22,769
Money?

605
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:25,539
An exclusive interview with Gweon Suk.

606
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:26,909
- What?
- What?

607
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:28,039
That's it?

608
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,539
What do you mean "That's it?"

609
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,110
She's Lee Gweon Suk.

610
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,349
She has never done a solo interview
since her comeback.

611
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,150
What do you say? Isn't that a nice deal?

612
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,989
Lee's solo interview
instead of a report on Kim Hee Won.

613
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,690
Delete the photos first.

614
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:47,760
After the interview.

615
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:50,929
It's annoying, isn't it?

616
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:53,840
I learned all this from you.

617
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:56,769
Call me.

618
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,550
Hey.

619
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,789
(Chicken breast and quail egg)

620
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,429
I won't jog with you anymore.

621
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,000
You can manage on your own, right?

622
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,599
I'm not a child.

623
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:28,440
Does he think I can't?

624
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:46,789
Silly me.

625
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,599
(Mister)

626
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,510
Gosh.

627
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,079
- Is it fun?
- Yes.

628
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,280
There.

629
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:15,519
Be careful.

630
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:17,789
There.

631
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:21,820
Red light, green light.

632
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:23,489
She's cute.

633
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,090
How old is she?

634
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:27,159
She's ten.

635
00:50:27,699 --> 00:50:28,900
The same age as Ye Jun.

636
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:32,900
Hee Won's son.

637
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,539
It's such a shame.

638
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,239
Why did he off himself...

639
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:42,079
when he has a young boy?

640
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:43,309
What?

641
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,750
Who caused his death?

642
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:50,690
All of us.

643
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:51,690
"All of us?"

644
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:54,690
Have you been meditating
since you quit baseball?

645
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,829
Quit the nonsense.

646
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,130
What about you?

647
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:00,659
Are you not responsible?

648
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,599
Hee Won was an honest professional.

649
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,900
He wasn't corrupt like us.

650
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Think about it.

651
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:10,840
Hee Won...

652
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:12,809
didn't break the law...

653
00:51:13,409 --> 00:51:15,340
until the very end.

654
00:51:23,449 --> 00:51:25,150
Where are these jerks?

655
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,590
I don't know.

656
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:29,389
You know where they are.

657
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,130
Tell me!

658
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,159
Be quiet.

659
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,980
If I tell your granddaughter...

660
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,050
that you got fired for fixing matches...

661
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,920
and that you're responsible
for a man's death,

662
00:51:58,349 --> 00:51:59,489
I'm very curious...

663
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,690
about what she'll say.

664
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:04,929
I really don't know where they are.

665
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,500
They shut down all the betting sites too.

666
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:10,900
I'm expecting to get a new URL...

667
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,869
from a new messenger ID.

668
00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:15,369
I'll pass it on to you when I get it.

669
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:19,070
That's all I can do.

670
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:20,909
Don't ever...

671
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,349
come to me again.

672
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,650
- Do you get it?
- Yes.

673
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,880
Hey.

674
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,320
Let's go home.

675
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,019
Okay.

676
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:32,119
- Bye.
- Bye.

677
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:33,260
- Bye.
- Bye.

678
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,730
(Recording 001)

679
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,739
(Read)

680
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:54,809
How could he be so mean?

681
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,650
(Mister)

682
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:01,550
Mister, are you the best agent ever?

683
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:02,920
(Mister, are you the best agent ever?)

684
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,389
You're ignoring
your athlete and your duties.

685
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:06,860
(You're ignoring
your athlete and your duties.)

686
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,989
And you left me on read.

687
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:09,519
(Mister)

688
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,190
Come outside. I'm by the gym.

689
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Gosh.

690
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:20,900
Over here.

691
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,480
Do I have to do this interview?

692
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:31,679
I really don't want to.

693
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:32,809
Just do it.

694
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,219
Is this what you do
as soon as you come around?

695
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,250
You're shipping me abroad too.

696
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,750
You always do whatever you want.

697
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,820
We need to get rid of those photos.

698
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:44,889
Did you have to be so childish?

699
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,429
Okay, fine.

700
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:49,599
I'll do it.

701
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,300
Just answer his questions.

702
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,739
That you're training hard.

703
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:56,639
That you really want to win.

704
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,440
Really?

705
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,980
You don't have a single day off.

706
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,820
You train all day every day.

707
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,519
You'll barely have time
for your boyfriend.

708
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:15,059
How can I see a boyfriend I don't have?

709
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:19,760
For now,
I want to focus on the title match.

710
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:21,929
Because...

711
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:25,369
I really want to win.

712
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:30,409
Call me if you have any good news.

713
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,679
This is an unrelated topic,

714
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:37,179
but do you know
Kim represented Kim Hee Won...

715
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,110
who exposed a match-fixing ring?

716
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:42,750
Yes.

717
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,949
When Kim came to see you,

718
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,960
did he make any strange offers?

719
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,860
Lose, then you'll find out.

720
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,630
You've never once lost.

721
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:54,730
Then let's run away together.

722
00:54:56,769 --> 00:54:57,769
From the ring.

723
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,630
I'll make it happen, no matter what.

724
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,079
Why are you all quiet?

725
00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:11,480
So he made an offer, didn't he?

726
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,480
Reporter Park.

727
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,250
Don't cross the line.

728
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:21,320
What does that have to do
with this interview?

729
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,130
He did make an offer.

730
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,769
He said
he'd get me the biggest match ever.

731
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:40,309
He told me he'd take me
to the place I wanted to go.

732
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,880
Right?

733
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,519
That's why I returned to the ring.

734
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,420
And he kept his promise.

735
00:55:57,559 --> 00:55:59,590
That's it for the interview.

736
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:01,400
Thank you for your time.

737
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:05,469
Thank you.

738
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:22,150
She did a great job with the interview.
She didn't get flustered at all.

739
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,489
Come on. Are you mad at me?

740
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,989
Forgive me. We're both pros, you know.

741
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:31,590
Delete the pictures.

742
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,530
Yes, of course. I should delete them.

743
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:37,230
This one and everything here.

744
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,670
Delete, move to trash.

745
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,369
As you promised,

746
00:56:42,139 --> 00:56:44,940
you have to publish a correction
to your article about Hee Won.

747
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,469
Don't you worry about that.

748
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:49,380
Hey, Kim.

749
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,210
There's something
I don't quite understand.

750
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:57,119
He didn't name anyone connected
to the match fixing in his suicide note.

751
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:00,320
What was he trying to hide
even in his final moments?

752
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:03,219
The fact that he hid them means...

753
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,530
that there was someone
he wanted to protect.

754
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:10,829
You really have nothing
to do with it, right?

755
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,510
I want to write a story on it.

756
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,139
Give me a call
if you find out anything new.

757
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,329
Don't you have something to tell me?

758
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,969
What do you want to hear?

759
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:46,070
What do you think?

760
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,139
"Good job with the interview today.
Well done."

761
00:57:50,739 --> 00:57:53,739
And an apology. "I'm sorry."

762
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,179
An apology for what?

763
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,750
Must I twist your arm to hear an apology?

764
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:03,119
Let's say the interview
was partially my fault.

765
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:05,420
But sending me to the US.

766
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:09,190
You've never once apologized for it.

767
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,699
I know what you're going through...

768
00:58:15,429 --> 00:58:18,900
and how you must be feeling,
so I've been patient.

769
00:58:21,269 --> 00:58:23,340
And I'll be honest.

770
00:58:23,969 --> 00:58:25,639
You've been neglecting me.

771
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:27,980
Am I wrong?

772
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,809
Don't miss your next payment deadline.

773
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:34,050
Next time, it could be somewhere else.

774
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:38,920
And it could be someone else, not you.

775
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,469
Mister.

776
00:58:52,269 --> 00:58:53,840
Aren't we going home?

777
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:59,510
Mister, where are we going?

778
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,360
Get out.

779
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,630
Why did you bring me here out of the blue?

780
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:23,769
I told you to get out.

781
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,630
Why did you bring me here?

782
00:59:25,969 --> 00:59:27,599
This isn't my home anymore.

783
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:28,969
You know that I moved out.

784
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:30,369
Hurry up and get out.

785
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:51,559
I'm taking my hands off your match.

786
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,000
I've already told the company about it.

787
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,469
So you're out?

788
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,170
Why?

789
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,099
You don't need me anymore.

790
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:03,170
You know Sun Jae, right?

791
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:05,469
He'll take care of you from now on.

792
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:09,739
What?

793
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,210
You can't suddenly spring this on me
without talking to me about it first.

794
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:17,090
It's not over
until I retire after the match.

795
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:19,150
You promised me that you'd help me retire.

796
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,219
Go ahead and retire.

797
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,889
I kept my promise
and got you the biggest match ever,

798
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:27,630
so I've done my job.

799
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:33,699
Are you doing this because of Kim Hee Won?

800
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:36,099
Is there really something going on?

801
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:38,739
That has...

802
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:41,440
nothing to do with your match.

803
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,179
Then why are you being like this,
seriously?

804
01:00:44,179 --> 01:00:45,210
Must I repeat myself?

805
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,619
I've done my job.

806
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,579
I managed to persuade Han Ah Reum...

807
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,719
and get you the match
that became the talk of the town.

808
01:00:52,889 --> 01:00:54,619
You didn't want anything more than that.

809
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:59,059
Mister,
is this about your plans for the US?

810
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,159
Because I refused to go to the US?

811
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,300
Yes, that's right.

812
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,710
Then what will happen if I change my mind
and say I'll go to the US?

813
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:15,239
- What will you do?
- Ms. Lee Gweon Suk.

814
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:18,650
No, Ms. Lee Yu Ri.

815
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,380
Don't say what you don't even mean.
Snap out of it, okay?

816
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:36,699
We're done.

817
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,769
You can retire after the match,
as we promised.

818
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,179
I'll find a new athlete.

819
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:01,860
(My Lovely Boxer)

820
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,250
You said we should run away together
from the ring.

821
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,219
So how could you leave like this?

822
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,420
I thought we were done talking about that.

823
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,650
What about the match? Will you do it?

824
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:34,420
- A shoulder injury?
- She's been in treatment for a week.

825
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:36,920
- Shall we make a move?
- Like what?

826
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,860
Take care of Lee Gweon Suk, for example.
We should do something.

827
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:41,360
Look into someone for me.

828
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,099
He's the head of an illegal gambling ring.

829
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,070
He works for Chairman Nam Hyun Ki.

830
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:47,070
Hello, sir. Don't you remember me?

831
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:48,699
We had a meal together with your son.

832
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:50,469
I have many sons.

833
01:02:50,469 --> 01:02:52,440
- I told you not to call me "Father."
- Okay, Father.

834
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,980
Could you let him know
that I'd like to be his friend?

835
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:57,380
Take a seat. Have a drink.

836
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,579
That won't help Gweon Suk in any way!

837
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:01,550
You're trying to bury Gweon Suk alive.

838
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:03,650
I really don't want to go to the US,

839
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:04,719
but...

840
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,360
I hate the thought of you leaving me
even more.
