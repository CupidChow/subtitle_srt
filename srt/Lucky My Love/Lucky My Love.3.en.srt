00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,951
I like you.

2
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,166
I like you too.

3
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,680
Oh! Why was I dreaming like this?

4
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,988
I better go showering.

5
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,202
9.00 AM. step with the left foot, right?

6
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,800
There must be something wrong. You’re here early today.

7
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,280
I’m hungry. / You’re here early for eating?

8
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,408
Oh! You both came together today?

9
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:08,697
No. I came across with her at the gate. 

10
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:10,607
Ah I see.

11
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:13,009
What?

12
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:16,644
It sounds weird. 

13
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:21,558
. Look! There are people wearing shirt with the same color.

14
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,410
Why?

15
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,200
Here!

16
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,920
Enough of both of them. Today the auspicious color is black.

17
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,832
I didn’t even say anything.

18
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,141
Hello everyone. 

19
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,617

Have you been tired?

22
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:47,917
Pretty tired…

23
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,149
I am tired. Really tired. Is there any chance to get a bonus this month?

24
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:54,512
Saimai. You can’t talk like this to him. 

25
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:56,072
Enough. No need to be arguing. 

26
00:02:56,072 --> 00:02:59,210
Just do your best today. Keep going!

27
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,199

How is it? Is it okay?

37
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:44,281
Well, it looks nice. I like it so much. 

38
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:47,496
Your company is great as people say.

39
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:51,967
I have to give credit to Khun Weala and her team.

40
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:54,425
I love it.

41
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,286
Hmm… 

42
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:03,000
Then, you don’t want to add any more things, right?

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,486
No. I like it like this. I’ll take this one.

44
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,323
Well, I probably must leave now.

45
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:15,775
Okay. I’ll take Khun Ray to the car

46
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:17,309
See you, Khun Ray.

47
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:18,515

49
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,463
How is it now?

50
00:04:34,463 --> 00:04:36,409
What…

51
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,633
Look! That was so clear. Don’t refuse to admit it.

52
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:43,813
Because there’s nothing.

53
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:47,015
Or… you fell in love with her.

54
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:48,511
No way. 

55
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,735
You know it. I don’t love anyone.

56
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:55,873
Khun Wea. If you find the right one. That one will get rid of your fear, 

57
00:04:55,873 --> 00:05:00,460
if the one is not right. May I take that one?

58
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,104
You should leave now.

59
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,958
I’m your client. You’re telling me to leave? 

60
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,800
There you go.

61
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,648

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,530

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,956
Khun Nabdao.

68
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,654
Khun Nabdao.

69
00:05:39,654 --> 00:05:41,642

70
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,467
See you in the evening

71
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:45,118
Yes

72
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,929
Hey Cindy, what are you doing?

73
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:15,402
Cindy's secret to a good figure

74
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:19,379
No wonder Miss Cindy always has a good figure.

75
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,141
I'll have to find some to eat soon.

76
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,767
You can do it.

77
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,178

You’re good as people say. 

81
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:47,671
Hmm… nah. I only meant to do it my best.

82
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:53,358
Beautiful and smart! Do you have a boyfriend?

83
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:56,661
No, I don’t.

84
00:06:56,661 --> 00:07:02,374
Same here. I don’t have a girlfriend.

85
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,209

89
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,984
Come on, sis.

90
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,808
Khun Nabdao…

91
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,325
Yes, boss?

92
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,795
Khun Nabdao…

93
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:07,724
Yes, 

94
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:12,760
I have something to tell you.

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,103
What about it?

96
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,802
I think you’re the one who makes my time runs faster.

97
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,626
Yes? What is it?

98
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,984
Everytime I’m near you. I’m so happy. I want to stop time.

99
00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:39,909
You’re what I want to see every day. 

100
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:44,649
I’ve been trying to find out about this,

101
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:53,958
and the answer is… I like you.

102
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,074
Is it possible if we try to…

103
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:11,545
Boss, I’m so drunk. 

104
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:13,140
I have headache too. 

105
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,636
Cindy. You’re too drunk now.

106
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:18,871
Hey, boss. Cheers!

107
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:21,283
Saimai.

108
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:26,240
Where should we go next? It’s so fun now!

109
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,153
Take care!

110
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:31,139
Saimai. Don’t be too noisy.

111
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:36,917
I’ll take her out now. I’m leaving

112
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:39,871
You go with Khun Ve, Okay?

113
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,409
Boss. I have a severe headache. We should leave now.

114
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:57,138
Okay. Take care of Nabdao for me, Khun Weala.

115
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,209
Let’s go. Hurry up, boss.

116
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,206
Are you okay?

117
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,577
Hmm… Khun Wea

118
00:10:13,577 --> 00:10:15,177
Nabdao

119
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:17,394
Khun Wea

120
00:10:17,394 --> 00:10:20,797
is so cute.

121
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,007
Let’s go home!

122
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:29,855
Going home? Take me there! 

123
00:10:29,855 --> 00:10:30,605
Yes.

124
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,169
It’s hot! 

125
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,536
It’s hot! Khun Wea

126
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,747
Ouch!!

127
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,616
What are you doing?

128
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,063
I just…

129
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,186
Heat it again once you’re awake.

130
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,541
Sis. / What's wrong?

131
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:50,599
Why did you have such a strange hairstyle today?

132
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:54,149
It's the same.

133
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,259
Where is it like?

134
00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:01,838
My hair is very long

135
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:06,184
I rode a motorcycle just now.

136
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:08,307
I don't know when the wig fell out.

137
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,816
So I had to wear a headband.

138
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,993
Should have expected that from the moment they left the house it wouldn't be blown away.

139
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:17,732
You're really good at knowing about other people.

140
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:21,353
I'm damaged.

141
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:24,385
Stop it, I have something to say.

142
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:29,400
I saw Nabdao coming down from Khun Wea's condo.

143
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,631
I saw them at the coffee shop.

144
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:39,320
They come together every day.

145
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,091
I thought I was the only one who knew.

146
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,976
I know.

147
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:46,291
Hey, I have something to say.

148
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,007
What's up?

149
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:48,141
You, do you know?

150
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:52,766
Nabdao with Khun Wea They have Something.

151
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,659
Nabdao, aren't you a fan of Boss Peam ?

152
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,682
 doesn't know anything at all.

153
00:14:57,682 --> 00:15:01,683
Tell me, you know everything.

154
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:04,504
You're the one who told me this.

155
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,263
Tell me where?

156
00:15:06,263 --> 00:15:09,515
Tell me about it.

157
00:15:09,515 --> 00:15:14,393
That day, they met in front of the office.

158
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:17,867
Many people saw each other.

159
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:20,994
They always come together.

160
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:22,897
I can't remember, there were too many things.

161
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:27,311
You're the one who told me.

162
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,712
Nooo… What happened to me. 

163
00:16:07,712 --> 00:16:11,215
I actually like Khun Wea… 

164
00:16:11,215 --> 00:16:15,742
What about Boss Peam.

165
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:20,882
I think you’re the one who makes my time runs faster.

166
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:23,683
Yes? What is it?

167
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,007
I like you. 

168
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,898
Oh, what is this?
