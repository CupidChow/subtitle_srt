1
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,754
Close your eye and let your heart lead you.

2
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:44,027
Close your eyes. 

3
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:46,802
Follow your heart.

4
00:00:46,802 --> 00:00:51,886
Oh god!  What a mystery. 

5
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,818
I don’t get it.

6
00:00:53,818 --> 00:00:59,654
What’s happening. Why are you upset this early?

7
00:00:59,654 --> 00:01:04,269
Ugh! I don’t get this one. It is so hard.

8
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,311
It’s a long story, right?

9
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:07,443
I see…

10
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:09,195
Let’s spill the tea. 

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,275
Well, it was like this

12
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:16,218
You want a full version one, right?

13
00:01:16,218 --> 00:01:17,196
A full one.

14
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,376
Long time no sees. Anything makes you anxious?

15
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:35,135
Ma’am,

16
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:41,240
I don’t know which one I should pick. I can’t find my answer.

17
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,699
So, you think these cards would help you? 

18
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:48,778
If a card turns out, you must be with one.

19
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:56,840
Then, you will pick that one even though you don’t love that one.

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,084
I’m afraid I’d pick the wrong one.

21
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:05,224
There is nothing incorrect about love. 

22
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:07,509
Take it easy.

23
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:14,137
Cards are unable to help you pick the right one.

24
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:21,920
Cards can advise you but it’s you who must decide.

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,621
You use your brain to think and it's tiring.

26
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:30,913
Close your eye and let your heart lead you.

27
00:02:30,913 --> 00:02:33,392
Listen to your own heart

28
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:38,386
It's clear now Who will your heart choose?

29
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:42,738
Don't beat your heart again.

30
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:45,891
It's tiring.

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,602
You really love hearing prediction!

32
00:02:51,602 --> 00:02:53,840
What about Boss Peam 

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,479
or which one who you really love.

34
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,795
What… You knew it?

35
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:02,282
Don’t tell me…Khun Wae.

36
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,980
Keep it down. People can hear it.

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,725
Oh! You both kissed?! 

38
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:16,790
I said keep it down!

39
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,641
I don’t want to be so dramatic but you both look like a couple.

40
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:29,637
Whatever you do seems to be fit in.

41
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:33,839
You’re right. 

42
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:39,040
I feel of being myself when I’m with her.

43
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:48,514
I feel good. It’s like I will see her beside me whether I feel good or bad.

44
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:53,013
I don’t know when did I find her.

45
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:57,512
I only fell in love with her now.

46
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,493
I don’t know.

47
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,188
Now I know which one you’re picking.

48
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:14,507
What about Boss Peam. I think I also like him.

49
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:16,744
Why do you like him?

50
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:20,040
He is cute, handsome, 

51
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,080
and gentle. Such a material-boyfriend in many girls dream.  

52
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,493
Ughh!!! I dob’t know which one to pick.

53
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:36,240
I can’t figure it out.

54
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,120
Stop first.

55
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,160
 Maybe you should let you follow your heart like the lady said.

56
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,814
Follow my heart… How?

57
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:55,804
Close your eyes… What! Close eyes and follow your heart.

58
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,962
What are you guys doing? Are you guys talking about me?

59
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:04,077
Oh god! I got frightened by you!

60
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:07,337
Well, Saimai

61
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:13,825
If someone told you to close your eyes and follow your heart. How would you do it?

62
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:17,370
I think probably… hugging!

63
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,485
Hugging? 

64
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,220
How…

65
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:28,020
Hmm… When we hug with someone, we will be able to hear their heartbeats.

66
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,159
We can feel how the other one feel and how you feel clearest.  

67
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:38,068
Wow Saimai, 

68
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:42,690
but who is that unfortunate boy?

69
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,879
Well, He is my lovely Sehun.

70
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,297
Ughh…

71
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:51,842
Here! 

72
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:53,908
What is this?

73
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:56,985
Choose one and I will tell you.

74
00:05:56,985 --> 00:06:00,245
I take this one.

75
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:04,695
What does it say? 	

76
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:08,101
Go having a meal with Khun Wae.

77
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,517
And another one?

78
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:13,786
It’s also “Having a meal with Khun Wae”

79
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:17,197
Oh!

80
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,565
You’re taken!

81
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,973
Taken what? A table? Are they going to reserve it for us?

82
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:36,287
Nubdao!

83
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,825
Hello! Nubdao!

84
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:41,066
What?

85
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,747
Hello 

86
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,191
Hello Boss. You look specifically handsome today.

87
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:51,821
Thank you.

88
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:54,900
Are you guys busy now?

89
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,542
No, Boss. There’ll be no work If  Wawa is there.
 

90
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:02,631
Saimai! You again!

91
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:07,210
May I have a private talk with Nubdao, please?

92
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,261
Uhh… sure!

93
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:13,807
What’s happening.

94
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,723
Well, you go first.

95
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:16,990
I’ve got to go.

96
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,148
What happened?

97
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,360
I don’t know. Do you?

98
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,786
Is there anything wrong?

99
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,093
Uhh… 

100
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:45,868
It’s not easy for me. 

101
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:50,333
I don’t understand what love is. 

102
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:56,776
I don’t even know how it feels like to love someone 

103
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:04,800
until the day I started feel like to see you happy 

104
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,098
or when you’re struggle. 

105
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:09,895
I want to be there for you.

106
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,521
I don’t know for you. Are these things called “Love”?

107
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,751
but for me, I think it is. 

108
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,420
I like you…

109
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,150
Is it possible if we should try…

110
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:49,076
Boss! Let me hug you.

111
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,900
Um.....

112
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,840
I feel thankful of your warm feelings for me 

113
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,036
 but I can’t really take it. 

114
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,723
You’re not sad?

115
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,261
Actually, I know who is in your mind. 

116
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:49,533
It’s just.. 

117
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,077
I don’t want to give up before I start it.

118
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:55,390
You knew it?

119
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,765
It’s probably only you who doesn’t know about your heart.

120
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,179
True. 

121
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:09,274
I’m sorry about doing this to you.

122
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:12,178
It’s alright. 

123
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:16,237
At least, I helped a person I love. 

124
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:18,127
Please, hurry up.

125
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,777
Hurry up?

126
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:23,435
Khun Wae saw when we were cuddling.

127
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,844
Okay. I’ve got to go.

128
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,309
Khun Wae. 

129
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,881
Listen to me first.

130
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:46,714
Let me go.

131
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:50,479
No! You now misunderstood about me.

132
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,317
Please, let me go.

133
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:55,221
 Khun Wae. Listen!

134
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,857
I didn’t like him.

135
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,275
I said you leave me!

136
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,008
I really like you. 

137
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:12,394
I don’t even know when I allowed you to get to my heart. 

138
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:18,120
I think of you every time I wake up in the morning,

139
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,590
before I go to sleep.

140
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,708
I just wanna ask you. 

141
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,358
Can you be my girlfriend?

142
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,093
Khun wae…

143
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:43,252
Please don’t get closer to me. 

144
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,795
I didn’t like you.

145
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,714
What about that we went for food, holding hands, 

146
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,406
and …

147
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:58,133
What does it mean?

148
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:01,921
You’re not the only one I’m doing this with. 

149
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,757
I hope you understand. 

150
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:08,139
I’ve got to go.

151
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,174
Are you okay?

152
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,994
I don’t understand. Why she…

153
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,684
She is like a dead clock 

154
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:34,077
but not broken yet or doesn’t know how to love. 

155
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:36,694
She is only afraid to love. 

156
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:39,382
Afraid to love. 

157
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,902
It’s not that everyone has such a good love in the past. 

158
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:46,427
It might be a bit hard

159
00:12:46,427 --> 00:12:52,080
hard but I think the clock would be able to work again  

160
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,432
with power of the star.

161
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:36,640
Remember! If we step in the office with our left-side foot, we will get a good luck for all day.

162
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,400
Let’s have a lunch. Yes/No

163
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,554
No

164
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,711
Let’s have dinner. Hotpot or Grilled pork?

165
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,614
You have no work to do?

166
00:14:14,614 --> 00:14:16,480
I do.

167
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,254
Why don’t you do it?

168
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:20,210
I’m doing it.

169
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:25,012
I can’t stop thinking about you.

170
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,804
It’s fine. I’ll be back again. I will not give up easily.

171
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,520
Before, I got shaking because of the coffee.

172
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:04,316
Since I find you. Coffee is no longer important.

173
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,880
I finally miss her again.

174
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,168
You miss me.

175
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,530
You will never be able to leave me.

176
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,771
Here!

177
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:45,484
No matter where you are. 

178
00:15:45,484 --> 00:15:50,031
I’ll always be by your side.

179
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,081
Khun Wea

180
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:57,587
I really like you.

181
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,668
Just like how you like Boss Peam.

182
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,507
Why are you smiling?

183
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,715
Because of you’re jealous of me. 

184
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:16,706
. I don’t like him just like I like you.

185
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:19,758
How’s the difference?

186
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:23,385
It’s true that Boss Peam is handsome

187
00:16:23,385 --> 00:16:25,348
and smart 

188
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:27,210
it’s not the same way as I like you. 

189
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,485
I want to be with you.

190
00:16:32,485 --> 00:16:35,760
I like when I can talk to you 

191
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,232
or even go everywhere with you.

192
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,533
I like it when I can hold your hand.

193
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,516
I like when I can touch you…

194
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,253
And I like it....

195
00:16:56,253 --> 00:16:59,884
Is that also how you get me?

196
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,282
The more you try to flee this star. 

197
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:11,949
You will be pulled closer by gravity. 

198
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:16,570
The time like me seems hard to get away from this star.
