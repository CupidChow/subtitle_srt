1
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,803
It’s hot!

2
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,174
It’s hot!

3
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,565
Khum Wae, I feel hot?

4
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,115
Ouch!

5
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,278
What are you doing?

6
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,228
I just…

7
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,898
3 months ago

8
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,713
Hello

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,986
How are you doing? Do you have any concerns?

10
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,834
Well…

11
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,929
You want a husband?

12
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,240
That’s right! Maybe just a boyfriend 
		but how do you know?

13
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,629
It’s just you seem to be ardent so far. 

14
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,683
All right. Close your eyes and imagine of what you’re suspicious 

15
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:28,261
about then pick 3 cards.

16
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,600
May this prediction take me to encounter a good person, 

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,810
A one who I can get along perfectly. 

18
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,535
No matter who that person is, I wish that we destined to meet each other.

19
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,459
Can I pick one now?

20
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,134
How is it, ma’am? 

21
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:06,680
You will meet one soon. 

22
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,081
. Unexpectable. 

23
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,000
The encounter of you both would be at the best time. 

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,068
Once it’s the right time, the person will come.

25
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:22,393
You both can see eye to eye.

26
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:25,929
See eye to eye? 

27
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:28,575
That’s so romantic. 

28
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:34,680
If the results turn out just like you said, I will share such a slay review for you ma’am 

29
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,587
Hey sis, why are you all seem to be so faded?

30
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,254
Or.. you argued with your boyfriend?

31
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:03,631
A boyfriend? I don’t even have one.

32
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:08,474
Oh! I thought you will get a boyfriend after the prediction.

33
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,396
Ughhhh!

34
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,009
Is there anything wrong?

35
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:29,357
Nothing

36
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,318
You want to eat this? / No, thanks.

37
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:51,336
Then, I will.

38
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,658
Is there anything wrong? 

39
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:15,604
Ah. You’re full now?

40
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,455
Girls are like this. Eating too less.

41
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:21,059
Well, I will eat it then.

42
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,688
Should I have sympathy for the guy or you, Nabdao? 

43
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,927
But I think… Isn’t it better if you just be frankly?

44
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:42,085
By telling him, it’s like I’m commanding. 

45
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:44,720
It’s not as special as he does it himself 

46
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,050
But.. 

47
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,816
Why are you always dissatisfying me?

48
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,193
Sis.. Did you see?

49
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:53,888
She’s still new about this. Just let it go.

50
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,897
Wow!

51
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:11,070
He is like an angel.

52
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,360
Obviously, an angel!

53
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,081
That’s Boss Peam, not any angel sis.

54
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,606
Hmph! Saimai

55
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:25,823
You are not belonging to us anymore

56
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:28,038
Woww.

57
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,418
Always dissatisfying me, Saimai.

58
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,414
He’s the right one that I’m looking for

59
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,390
Hello

60
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,200
I don’t think it’s that easy. 

61
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,940
Look! Cindy is trying to steal your spotlight.

62
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,595
Hmph! What a day! I wear a lucky color shirt. I start my day stepping with my left foot out of home.

63
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:07,365
Still, where is the boyfriend?

64
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,932
You seem to be stressful.

65
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,523
Boss! When did you get here?

66
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:17,665
I’ve got here for a while now.

67
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,652
Hm well, what’s new?

68
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:26,760
It just so happen that I’ve heard you like it so I bought one

69
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,391
.. for everyone.

70
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,852
So, can we eat it now?

71
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:38,136
Don’t you see? There’s only one.

72
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,045
Hey! I’d like to inform that tomorrow there’ll be a new boss here

73
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:47,278
Yes, Boss

74
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,963
Hmm.. Boss. 

75
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,618
Thank you

76
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:08,960
It’s mine. Only for me. No sharing.

77
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,192
Ahh. 

78
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,488
What a tiring day!

79
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,608
Why is he so cute? 

80
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,624
What’s up sis. Why you called me?

81
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:17,448
Oh! You were asleep?

82
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:21,306
Siss. Nooo. I was dreaming my sweet dream. 

83
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:25,920
Hurry up! There’s a conference with boss this morning.

84
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,340
I’ve got to go.

85
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,799
9 AM.. to step my left foot at 9.. 

86
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,483
Sorry!

87
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,390
That’s alright.

88
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,120
Not yet? Please be hurry to make an appointment for me

89
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,078
See? I knew it

90
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:54,020
What’s wrong with you?

91
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,787
I wear the wrong color shirt. It’s such a bad luck.  

92
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,538
Everyone is here. Let me introduce the new marketing team’s boss

93
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,920
Here is Vela. The new boss of our marketing team.

94
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Hello

95
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Nice to meet you all,  

96
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,218
and also..

97
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,383
I think this one is yours. 

98
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,894
Thank you.

99
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,021
I’ve told you all to be here today

100
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,579
since we’re having an important client.

101
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,832
Hello everyone. I’m Ray.

102
00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:18,388
Hello

103
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,524
So, I’d like you all to concentrate with works. Are you all okay?

104
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,441
There are many cute girls here. 

105
00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:31,001
It’s starting to intrigue me.   

106
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,301
That’s great!

107
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,240
Oh!

108
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,120
Wea. You work here?

109
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,524
Yes. Why are you here?

110
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,691
Hmm.. You both know each other?

111
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:46,712
Yes. Just have you here. That’s good.

112
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:50,413
Vela also just moved here as a new marketing team’s boss,

113
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:53,345
including responsible for our project.

114
00:12:53,345 --> 00:12:56,923
It’s so great to have you here! I feel relieve now. 

115
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,745
What is your new product, Khun Ray?

116
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,818
My heart

117
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,515
Just kidding. 

118
00:13:07,515 --> 00:13:10,271
It’s a lipstick. Let me show you.

119
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,131
This is my product.

120
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:18,462
Actually, to advertising. You all can have fully right to design. I’m kind of easy going.  

121
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:21,622
Our budget this year, 50 millions baht. Let’s do it!

122
00:13:21,622 --> 00:13:22,948
50 millions baht. 

123
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:26,249
When will be the deadline to present this concept? 

124
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:27,444
Next week.  

125
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:33,960
I’m also kind of furious and the opening day for the product is on this month.

126
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,028
. So, I want you all to be hurry. 

127
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,678
Okay 

128
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,246
Would be great if I can get a cup of hot chocolate.

129
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,947
Khun Nubdao 

130
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:11,370
Here’s a coffee for you.

131
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,918
Thank you boss.

132
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,829
Excuse me boss. There’s none for me?

133
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:25,440
Well, I couldn’t carry so many at once.

134
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,800
Excuse me. I have got to leave now. Go girls!

135
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,443
Keep going!

136
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,233
Thank you 

137
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,893
Vava. 

138
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:48,094
I think our Boss seems to be different lately. 

139
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:51,179
I think he has a personal favorite.

140
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,742
Uh. Saimai. 

141
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:57,373
What’s wrong with you? Are you still good?

142
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,465
I’m not good. I feel like to sleep so badly

143
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,715
You all can leave now. 

144
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,816
I will try to finish a little more.

145
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,280
Oh. Nabdao. Well, who is going to take you home?

146
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,635
I’ll take that duty to take Nabdao home.

147
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:18,444
. Everyone can leave. Don’t worry

148
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,925
So, I’m leaving now. 

149
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:23,518
Nubdao, See you

150
00:15:23,518 --> 00:15:24,594
See you  

151
00:15:24,594 --> 00:15:25,950
Don’t stay up here till late, okay? 

152
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,035
Yes.

153
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:28,818
Take care of her 

154
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:30,715
I’m leaving now

155
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:33,484
See you / Drive safely. Bye

156
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,159
Oh god! Why is it so hard?

157
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,064
think! Nubdao.

158
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,030
Well,

159
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,597
maybe take a little break? 

160
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,640
How do you know what kind of drink do I like?

161
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,618
I’ve never seen you drink coffee at all. 

162
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:13,493
Also, you are the only one at the office who drinks hot chocolate.

163
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,320
You’re so observant. 

164
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:23,053
Well, I allergic to coffee. I’d have heart palpitations 

165
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:24,721
I knew it. 

166
00:16:24,721 --> 00:16:27,674
How’s your work going? Let me see

167
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:30,577
There’s one here. It’s not very good. 

168
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:32,632
I’m trying to work on it.

169
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,405
I think it’s perfect now. Really okay. 

170
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:39,945
Better not to put too much pressure on yourself.
