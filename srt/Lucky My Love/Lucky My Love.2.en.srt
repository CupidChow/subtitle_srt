1
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,861
Oh god! Why is it so hard? think! Nubdao.

2
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,048
Well,

3
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:45,981
maybe take a little break?

4
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,581
Oh! 

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,675
How do you know what kind of drink do I like?

6
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:56,973
I’ve never seen you drink coffee at all. 

7
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,029
Also, 

8
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:02,670
you are the only one at the office who drinks hot chocolate.

9
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,471
You’re so observant. 

10
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:12,441
Well, I allergic to coffee. I’d have heart palpitations if I have it.

11
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:13,847
I knew it. 

12
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:16,809
How’s your work going? Let me see.

13
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:19,727
There’s one here. It’s not very good.

14
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:22,092
I’m trying to work on it.

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,659
I think it’s perfect now. Really okay. 

16
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,973
Better not to put too much pressure on yourself.

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,950
Nubdao!

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,933
Nubdao!

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,961
Nubdao!

20
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,225
Are you okay?

21
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,682
I’m good. 

22
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:44,604
Probably a bit tired.

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,155
Well, I think. We should go home now. It’s getting late. 

24
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:50,846
We can continue this work tomorrow.

25
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:53,838
Okay. Let’s go.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,830
So tired. 

27
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,894
There were so many tensions today.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,983
Really?   

29
00:02:14,983 --> 00:02:17,910
Did you step out of the house with the right foot side?

30
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,654
Yes, I did.

31
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:24,120
Oh! How do you know about my belief?

32
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,346
Everyone knows about you, I guess…

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,019
Ahh. Remember! 

34
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:38,702
If we step in our first pace with the left side, we will get lucky for all days. 

35
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:40,357
Really? 

36
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:42,124
I will try this next time, 

37
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:46,640
but I think I’m lucky today.

38
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,077
It’s good because we have received the mega project which is great

39
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:56,520
but it’s quite hard.

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,708
Hmm. It’s quite hard 

41
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:05,836
but it’s nice to get to see some funny and odd people

42
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:07,852
Are you mocking me?

43
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:09,762
I’m not.

44
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,519
Well, Khun Wea. When is your birthday?

45
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,461
Uhh why? Are you trying to give me some gifts secretly?

46
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:20,094
I have no money.

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,222
I will look for the right lucky shirt’s color for you

48
00:03:25,222 --> 00:03:26,142
I see.

49
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,023
It was Saturday.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,017
Really? Me too! So, 

51
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:38,120
you must remember to wear a white or brown one and you must 

52
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,080
not wear a red or black one.

53
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,949
Okay. 

54
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,368
Let’s go home. It’s too late now.

55
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:49,498
Sure. Let’s go.

56
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,205
We’ve arrived?

57
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:16,600
Yes

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,808
Khun Nabdao. 

59
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:23,115
Are you free tomorrow?

60
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,065
Hmm?	

61
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,659
Well, I have some strategies to help you for the project.

62
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,318
Take it easy. I’ll come picking you up tomorrow.

63
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:37,783
Good night.

64
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,138
All right. Khun Wea. Good night.

65
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,588
Khun Wea

66
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:06,749
Why are we here?

67
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:08,888
Why not?

68
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:12,119
I thought we’re going to work. 

69
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,817
Really?

70
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:17,066
Did I say so?

71
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:19,108
Yes! You did.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,386
Khun Wea…

73
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,517
To step in cafe, right side, right?

74
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,742
Khun Wea…Hmm

75
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,374
Khun Wea What are you doing?

76
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,903
Let’s go.

77
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:01,368
Thank you.

78
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:04,585
Let’s get inside.

79
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,058
Wow. Smell of coffee. It’s so good

80
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:22,030
You allergic to Coffee, don’t you?

81
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,713
Yes.

82
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:27,281
Impressive! you can remember it.

83
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,601
Would you like any dessert? 

84
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:38,480
Some dark chocolate, cheesecake, or a croissant?

85
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,016
I saw you seem to be stressful. 

86
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:46,651
Too stressed might caused you not to have an idea..

87
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:50,269
Hmm. True. 

88
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,863
Well, should we have a dark chocolate one or a croissant one?

89
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:54,962
Let’s have a cheesecake

90
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:57,680
I’d like a cheesecake with.....

91
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,717
Hot Cocoa?

92
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,813
Sure 

93
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:05,703
Okay. I’ll order them for you. You can go sit first.

94
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:08,384
Okay, I’ll be sitting there

95
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,715
Oh! Khun Wea. 

96
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:57,540
What is this?

97
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,051
A love?

98
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,167
I meant to make it by myself. 

99
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:07,125
Probably not very pretty but I made it with my heart

100
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,191
So cute 

101
00:09:09,191 --> 00:09:11,184
Me or A cocoa?

102
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,773
A cocoa. 

103
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,717
I was kidding you. 

104
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,090
You’re cute too.

105
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,337
Let’s take a picture.

106
00:09:23,337 --> 00:09:24,887
Sure

107
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:37,880
Let’s see. What Khun Wea’s made. It’s so cute.

108
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,966
Try it.

109
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,286
Let’s try. 

110
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:46,100
Hmm. Should I?

111
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,609
I will try it now.

112
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:50,705
Please do it.

113
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,566
It’s good.

114
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,226
Your mouth is messy now.

115
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,881
Now back to be pretty like the same

116
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,974
Well, Khun Wea. You’re being caring with everyone?

117
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:28,595
I’m not. I only do this with the one I care.

118
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:33,528
If I don’t know. I might think that you’re flirting me.

119
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,630
Well… I think you’re right...

120
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,305
Is it good?/Yes, it is.

121
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:10,262
I can’t finish this one. 

122
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:14,812
It’s so hard. I can’t fugure it out

123
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,156
Hold on.

124
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,560
What are you looking at? Khun Nubdao, do your work.

125
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,659
I’m doing it

126
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,674
Where are we going to?

127
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:48,586
You’ll see.

128
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,502
You’ll lose.

129
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,909
Hurry up! That one!

130
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,921
Thank you so much for today.

131
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,318
It’s okay. You’re welcome.

132
00:14:58,318 --> 00:15:01,477
Well, see you tomorrow.  

133
00:15:01,477 --> 00:15:04,684
Remember to wear black clothes or blue

134
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:07,760
And not to wear white or red

135
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,653
Yes, ma’am my boss. 

136
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:12,157
I’ll take a rest now. Don’t forget to dream about me.

137
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:15,426
I better just go. Good night, Khun  Wea. 

138
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,872
I like you.

139
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,474
I like you too.

140
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,679
Oh! Why was I dreaming like this?

141
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,873
I better go showering.
