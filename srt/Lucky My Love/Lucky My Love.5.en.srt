1
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,679
Come in! You’ve been here before! 

2
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,287
Or... you don’t remember.

3
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:50,560
Khun Wae!!!

4
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,713
You forget it, I guess…

5
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,675
Well… Why don’t you think I remember it?

6
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,050
I don’t believe you.

7
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,930
That day… we…

8
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,298
We did what…

9
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,129
Nabdao 

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,516
Nabdao 

11
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,380
Wait till my turn.  

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,499
So, what about recently?

13
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:23,817
That’s embarrassing!

14
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,058
You feel regret? 

15
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,079
Sure! But still not too late.

16
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,093
 Do you want to be my girlfriend?

17
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:50,806
What are you doing?

18
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:51,837
Dob’t look!

19
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:07,319
No.

20
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,562
No way that I’d deny.

21
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:21,275
Khun Wae. 

22
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:25,607
I was afraid of your answer. I thought you’d say ‘’no’’

23
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:28,283
What about if I said “No”

24
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:31,602
I’d just keep flirting you

25
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,916
because…

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,247
Time is now surrounding by stars.  

27
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,249
 Good morning Khun Waela.

28
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:36,852
Good morning.

29
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:41,492
Khun Wae, you woke up so early! Is there anything I can help?

30
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:46,052
What kind of noodles do you like?

31
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:47,816
I like the soft ones.

32
00:06:47,816 --> 00:06:49,434
 Same here! 

33
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:52,816
What about eggs? What kind?

34
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:56,510
I like the cooked one. Really cooked! 

35
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,054
How about you? 

36
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:00,954
Me too! I like cooked!

37
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:04,777
Khun Wae, are you kidding me?

38
00:07:04,777 --> 00:07:09,646
 I’m not. Whatever you like. I like it too!

39
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,745
Khun Wae, 

40
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,622
 I’m hungry. 

41
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:21,057
Should we have some noodles first?

42
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:22,789
Fine.

43
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,305
Done! You can have it!

44
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,975
It does smell good! 

45
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:41,882
You’re so adorable.

46
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,922
 A prize for a cute one.

47
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:49,437
And you love me too?

48
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:53,134
I do. I love you so much!

49
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:55,600
Let’s eat.

50
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,921
Look how good your skills are.

51
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,159
I’ll taste how good you can make. 

52
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,486
Anything on my lips?

53
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,216
 Nothing.

54
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,053
Where is it?  / Here.

55
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,466
There’s nothing.

56
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:40,588
I’ll eat it more. It tastes so good.  

57
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,601
Oh! Cindy. You’re beautiful today.

58
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:01,980
thank you

59
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,714
Oh! Such a sweet color today. 

60
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:14,033
Must be a lucky color for sure.

61
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:18,540
Does it represent the love of you both?

62
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,080
It has been this good.  

63
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,901
The only lucky thing is not about colors but our wedding.

64
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:27,319
Enough! 

65
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:29,668
You made her feel shy.

66
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:33,829
Not really. I like it.

67
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:38,603
Woww… I feel so jealous of you.

68
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:41,079
Congratulations! 

69
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,396
Well, boss… I…

70
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:46,160
That’s alright. It’s her happiness. 

71
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,975
Please take care of her. 

72
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,291
I’ve got to go now.

73
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,259
Yes, boss.

74
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:03,016
Congratulations to you both.  

75
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:07,624
And for Boss Peam, I’ll take care of him.

76
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,133
Now you take him out. 

77
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,464
It’s over!

78
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,400
So creepy.

79
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,723
Let’s go.

80
00:11:07,723 --> 00:11:11,671
Where are you bringing me to?

81
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,600
To date…

82
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,440
Dating? Would you mind let me do some recharge before going?

83
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,595
No?

84
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:29,060
No.

85
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,633
Oh why?  

86
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:35,331
Nothing but better not. 

87
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:37,843
May I have it one more time?

88
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:39,728
Khun Wea

89
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:43,588
You should leave now. Stop tricking me.

90
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:46,010
Let’s go.

91
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,512
Wow! So beautiful.

92
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,497
Really?

93
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:59,407
But not as pretty as Nabdao, though.

94
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:02,625
Hmm… really?

95
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,084
Yes.

96
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,997
You’re so lucky to have such a cute girlfriend. 

97
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:22,464
. Let’s give lots of thanks to Madame 

98
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:26,069
because she got me a right one at the right time.

99
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,814
You chose me because someone told you to? 

100
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,585
No. 

101
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:38,167
It was because she told me to close my eyes and I must follow my heart,

102
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:41,560
listen to my heart.

103
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,627
What did your heart tell you about?

104
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:45,746
My heart said

105
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:50,643
Khun Wae, Wae, Wae. It’s only you!

106
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:56,115
Thank you for being such a good luck for me. 

107
00:12:56,115 --> 00:13:02,193
From now on, Your time will be having me for always.

108
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:05,342
That’s really nice of you too, 

109
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:09,465
to get rid of all fears from my heart.

110
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:12,147
I love you.

111
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:14,557
I love you too.

112
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:20,445
Ok! Then. From now on, you’re mine.

113
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,600
 Let’s go!
