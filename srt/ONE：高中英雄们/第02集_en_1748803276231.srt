1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
Technically谢谢

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,080
She's in a states

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,800
Come on

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Ah!

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
You dance.

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
Try it again.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Is it slow?

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Faster.

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
You!

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,640
What's the problem?

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
It's too long.

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
This is fun.

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
Again?

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,440
Ah, it's time.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm lying.

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Who is it? Nice.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Look at this.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Did you get it right?

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You bastard.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No matter how much you get slapped, you're just a criminal.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll make you a hell of a school.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You can hit a school like a candle.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The fight is about to start.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you stand on the street, you'll be hit.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You must get hit and get beaten.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Get up.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Faster!

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hey, you bastard!

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You bastard!

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You didn't do that.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're making me a criminal.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You bastard!

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You bastards!

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ah!

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Where is this?

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You bastard!

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You bastard!

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You bastard!

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll kill you!

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You bastard!

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You bastard!

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You bastard!

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You bastard!

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you remember...

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
the...

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Get up, get up, get up.

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Stop.

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You lost.

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Just stay still.

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You can't do it with your money.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hey, hey.

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Hey, you're the one who got hit on the street.

53
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Where is that bastard?

54
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You could have died.

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I didn't know he was such a weirdo.

56
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sure he was really surprised.

57
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He thought he was a criminal, but he's a fool.

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
As expected.

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Fight skills are talent.

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What's wrong with you?

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hmm...

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Personal curiosity?

66
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The only person who has recognized your talent?

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You...

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
can't fight, can you?

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You're a bit like a kid.

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The coach doesn't really matter

71
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
about fighting skills.

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The eyes are important.

73
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I've had it.

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I've always believed in my skills

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and hated those kids.

76
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
They're just kids.

77
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Where are you?

78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You didn't answer my call.

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I heard you didn't get a size in the academy.

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Call your dad, the one you see this time.

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Kang Hyung-gi.

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes.

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let me ask you something.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Hurry up. I'll give you 100.

85
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's change our clothes.

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Thank you.

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You're in big trouble.

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thank you, my friend.

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll learn how to use the PR look on YouTube

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and bring it to school tomorrow.

91
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Don't worry.

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Thank you so much.

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You're my friend.

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll go first.

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Already?

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Aren't you hungry?

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm late. I have to go.

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Where are you going?

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
To the academy.

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You have to go and study.

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You were the top of the school, right?

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're a student who has been through a lot.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm going.

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hey, Kim Hyuk-yum.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wait a minute.

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Here.

107
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is BB cream.

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If you get bruises on your face, you'll get a lot of bruises.

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Your parents will be surprised.

110
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I didn't even say thank you.

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm a weirdo.

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're so annoying.

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What should we do?

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Just think about it.

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What do you mean?

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If Seung-jun gets broken,

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
we won't let you go first.

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We have to step on it first before you know it.

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You should've just stood there like a ghost.

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You were the top of the school.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You were the top of the school.

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You were the top of the school.

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's a ghost!

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's not waste time.

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We're going to be late.

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We're going to waste time.

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You have time.

128
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You've got a lot of money.

129
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Stop it.

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't do it!

131
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hey!

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You bastard.

133
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Did you get hit?

134
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You bastard!

135
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Don't do it!

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't do it!

137
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Wake up, baby.

138
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Wake up, baby.

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Baby.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why are you so surprised?

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Did you dream?

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What kind of dream is this?

144
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What's wrong with your lips?

145
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I was playing basketball yesterday and got hit by a ball.

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You should be careful.

147
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's okay.

148
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll stop here.

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm going to play basketball.

150
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sure it's different from playing basketball.

151
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Mom,

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Can I have some rice?

153
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Rice?

154
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Sure.

155
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Do you want some sausage fried rice?

156
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Sure.

157
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I should move to another school.

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If I fall into the Chinese class, I can't get into that school.

159
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'll take the test of the level test.

160
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Dad.

161
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll try harder.

162
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You can do it, dad.

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay.

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You can do it.

165
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes.

166
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Okay.

167
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Wait a minute.

168
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Thank you.

169
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's really good.

170
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But...

171
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's not the end of the father's word.

172
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Eat more.

174
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Eat a lot.

175
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Hey.

176
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're the best.

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
How can you break your son without a name?

178
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What?

179
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Don't you have a face?

180
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You're the best.

181
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You should get in.

182
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Be quiet.

183
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's comfortable to let go of it.

184
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No.

185
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What are you doing?

186
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Get up.

187
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Get up.

188
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Get up.

189
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Get up.

190
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Hey, Seungjun.

191
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
How can you break it while fighting?

192
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Tell me.

193
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Why are you telling me that?

194
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You're not a kid.

195
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What kind of fight is this?

196
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If you have a lot of points, you win?

197
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you hit the wall, you win once you hit the wall.

198
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's not a fight.

199
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm not a kid.

200
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm sick.

201
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Be straight.

202
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Hey.

203
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If you can't get your head off the wall,

204
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
you'll be dead today.

205
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Answer me.

206
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Okay.

207
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I won't answer.

208
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay.

209
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay.

210
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This was your way to go to your house, right?

211
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why?

212
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Are you going to go another way?

213
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You can go another way.

214
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But my house is out of the blue.

215
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm tired of you.

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I didn't get hurt.

217
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm a strong guy.

218
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Younggi, let's talk while walking.

219
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You'll be late.

220
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Hey, you're late.

221
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm not late.

222
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm not late.

223
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm not late.

224
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm not late.

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's talk. You'll be late.

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If you're late, you'll get a message from your dad.

227
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I saw YouTube and bought a fake shot of Gwasanan, a fake shot of Gwatansan, and a fake shot of your skin.

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Aren't you grateful?

229
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Do you know what the principle of fake shots is to remove blood?

230
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why do you know that?

231
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You're so ridiculous.

232
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Isn't this really a big deal for us?

233
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But I can't tell you what Ji Hyuk said.

234
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This is a real strong show.

235
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Isn't this a lot?

236
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, I'm going.

237
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Kim Ik-young and Kang Kyu are going together.

238
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Today, Kim Seung-joon and Chaeyoung were beaten by Lee Yang-hye, Lee Jin-woo, and Lee Yang-hye.

239
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You don't know what that means, do you?

240
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You won't know.

241
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You have to fight with Lee Yang-hyeon in the future.

242
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I told you.

243
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm not going to fight.

244
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I told you.

245
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm not going to fight.

246
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But how did you fight?

247
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But don't worry.

248
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm here for you.

249
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm here for you.

250
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Lee Yang-hyeon is Choi Ji-hyeok.

251
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He fights with his best.

252
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I think I'll keep fighting.

253
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Kim Seung-joon.

254
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Kim Seung-joon, you bastard.

255
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hey, are you okay?

256
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hey, wake up.

257
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

258
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's okay.

259
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Don't worry about it.

260
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What are you talking about?

261
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Don't worry.

262
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Don't do it if you want to.

263
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

264
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

265
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

266
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Wake up.

267
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Wake up.

268
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Wake up.

269
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Lee Gyeong-ah.

270
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Lee Gyeong-ah.

271
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Lee Gyeong-ah.

272
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, my God.

273
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, my God.

274
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Kim Gyeong-ah.

275
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Wake up.

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Are you okay?

277
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hey, Kim Gyeong-ah.

278
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Wake up.

279
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Hey, wake up.

280
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Are you okay?

281
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Hey, what are you doing?

282
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Just stay here.

283
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll call the nurse.

284
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Where are you going?

285
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Hey, don't stay here.

286
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Let me invite you to my place.

287
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Where are you going?

288
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Hey, you can't go now.

289
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Hey, are you okay?

290
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Are you okay?

291
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What happened?

292
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Hey, hey, hey.

293
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's okay.

295
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Aren't we in trouble?

296
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I hit it too hard, Seungjun.

297
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
There's something going on in the motorcycle.

298
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You should've calculated it and hit it.

299
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You can't leave again.

300
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Thank you.

301
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Thank you.

302
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But I'm really glad you're like this.

303
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Do you know how surprised your mom was?

304
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What happened?

305
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It slipped on the stairs.

306
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The bus stop at 378, the hospital in the school is a bit far.

307
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So we're on the way.

308
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
There's a staircase in the middle.

309
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But the stairs are very narrow.

310
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So the kids often fall asleep there.

311
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I fell asleep about three times when I was in 1st grade.

312
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I broke my arm here.

313
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
How many students are you in school?

314
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Why?

315
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What happened to your back?

316
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm not good at studying.

317
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll go in first.

318
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Okay, then go carefully.

319
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Thank you.

320
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Goodbye.

321
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Goodbye.

322
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'll get up now.

323
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I have to go to the academy.

324
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Are you in the academy now?

325
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You're not in the right place.

326
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Just stay.

327
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sorry for making you worry.

329
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Why are you so sad?

330
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes.

331
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You can't get hurt.

332
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You can't even get sick.

333
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Are you okay?

338
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Do you want me to take you to the hospital?

339
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Wait a minute.

340
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You just have to stay like this.

341
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Is this your friend?

342
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
What?

343
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I have a uniform.

344
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Didn't you come to see your face?

345
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Hello.

346
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Thank you for coming all the way here.

347
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
How is your stomach?

348
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Fortunately, I didn't get hurt.

349
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I guess you were worried.

350
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I didn't come here long ago, but I'm here to see my friends.

351
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I have to go now.

352
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Goodbye.

353
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You're looking at your face.

354
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
No, I'm just curious if it's okay.

355
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
What's wrong with your face?

356
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Don't touch it.

357
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm going to move. I'm going to apply the ointment.

358
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Men get hurt so often.

359
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm worried about you.

360
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What?

362
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Stop standing up.

365
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Don't you hurt your back anymore?

366
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I met someone like you.

367
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Hey, Yu-gyeom.

368
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Can you talk to me?

369
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
What do you mean?

370
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm curious about your school life.

371
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Did your friends date?

372
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
No.

373
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's better to rest tomorrow, right?

374
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's okay.

375
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
No, let's just rest.

376
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I had a problem, but I can't go to school right away.

377
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Mom, you can get back to me if you don't go.

378
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You don't want to talk to me?

379
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Are you being resentful of me right now?

380
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You're being resentful of me right now.

381
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Right?

382
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Yu-gyeom, I'm sorry.

383
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What are you going to do?

384
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's not just mom's hard time. You must be having a hard time, too.

385
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Mom.

386
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I have to study.

387
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Mom.

388
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
This is really crazy.

389
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Hey, I was so upset and at least I was relieved.

390
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Hey, didn't you really feel sorry for your friend who slipped from the stairs yesterday?

391
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But your father was so scared that he wanted to check the scene.

392
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And he seemed to be the only one left.

393
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But your father's post was really amazing.

394
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You were so good to live under your father.

395
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Kim Sung-jun, you're calling me a fool.

396
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Kim Sung-jun, Kim Sung-jun, Kim Sung-jun, why are you calling me?

397
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You're so annoying.

398
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm the most murderous person in the world.

399
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Why aren't you at school?

400
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
If you're a little bit upset, you should have been lying down.

401
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I didn't have a problem with the fact that you came out to be a suspect yesterday.

402
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But please end it here.

403
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:47,000
If you're proud of yourself, too.

404
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Kim Yu-gyeom.

405
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Don't be a coward.

406
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Be like a coward.

407
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Okay?

408
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Let's go.

409
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
What?

410
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Should we start?

411
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Can we?

412
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Hey, Seung-bin, you're going to die like that.

413
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Are you out of your mind?

414
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm so upset.

415
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You're over 100,000.

416
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It's okay.

417
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's over now.

418
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Hey, Kim Sung-jun.

419
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I told you to take Kim Yu-gyeom.

420
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Don't you think my head is clear?

421
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Huh?

422
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Let's see if Kim Yu-gyeom is scared or I'm scared.

423
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I...

424
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I...

425
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I stepped on it safely yesterday, so that the baby won't be forgotten again.

426
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You're a bad boy.

427
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Hey, Kim Yu-gyeom.

428
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Who is Kim Yu-gyeom?

429
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It's a call, brother.

430
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Go away.

431
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Are you Kim Yu-gyeom?

432
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm asking you, but you don't answer.

433
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Hey, Hong-il.

434
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
What?

435
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You don't answer like this?

436
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm good at answering.

437
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm a bad boy.

438
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Hey, seniors.

439
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
If you do this here, I have no choice but to do this to Da-in.

440
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
What are you? Are you Da-byun?

441
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Why aren't you answering?

442
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Oh, I'm not Da-byun.

443
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm a group leader, brother.

444
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Hey.

445
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Hey, Choe Yong-il.

446
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Aren't you getting up?

447
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You're going to sell this baby to me?

448
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Hey.

449
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Yes.

450
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Kim Yu-gyeom.

451
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Come to the rooftop at lunchtime like this.

452
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
If you're a minute late, all the kids here are bored until they graduate from school.

453
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Here you are.

454
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Hey.

455
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Why are you so good at it?

456
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You want to die, right?

457
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Look at your face.

458
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'm sorry.

459
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Hey, you don't know what a soldier is, do you?

460
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Hey, Ji-ah, let's fight properly today.

461
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Don't fight like that.

462
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Don't talk.

463
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Did you get too much water?

464
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Kim Yu-gyeom.

465
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yes.

466
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Yu-gyeom.

467
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yes.

468
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You're good at answering now.

469
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Why didn't you answer when you were asking for a senior?

470
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm sorry.

471
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It's all my fault.

473
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But please send me a courage.

474
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
What?

475
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You're a trainee.

476
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I almost got hit by him.

477
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Okay?

478
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I didn't even think of touching your friend.

479
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
What?

480
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
What's wrong?

481
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I didn't even think of touching your friend.

485
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
What?

486
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Hey, what's wrong?

487
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm annoyed.

488
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm going to see my friends.

489
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yes.

490
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You know, Yu-gyeom.

491
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I can't just let Seung-jun and Hong-il go.

492
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You did wrong, right?

493
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yes.

494
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So you should be punished for it, right?

495
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yes.

496
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Hey, Kim Seung-jun.

497
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Come here.

498
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Hurry up, you bastard.

499
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Why?

500
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I don't want to bother you anymore.

501
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I don't want to bother you anymore.

502
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Get out of my way.

503
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You're holding back because you don't want to fight with me anymore.

504
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Don't make any more trouble.

505
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Kim Yu-gyeom.

506
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Yes?

507
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Apologize to my beloved brother.

508
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Seung-jun, I'm sorry.

509
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I won't be able to repay you again, and I'll do everything you ask me to do in the future.

510
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Hey, Seung-jun.

511
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I haven't seen your boxing competition in a while.

512
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Kim Yu-gyeom, take a break.

513
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Take a break.

514
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Seung-jun.

515
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You're so good at this.

516
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You're so good at this.

517
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You're so good at this.

518
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You're so good at this.

519
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You're so good at this.

520
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You're so good at this.

521
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
You're so good at this.

522
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You're so good at this.

523
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Hey, you're so cute.

524
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Seung-jun.

525
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
From now on, you're a bastard who's been walking around like a fool.

526
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Don't be so cold-hearted.

527
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Hey, Seung-jun.

528
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
What are you doing?

529
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Hit me.

530
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Hey, don't be so far away.

531
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Hey.

532
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Hey, you bastard.

533
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You're crazy about this bastard.

534
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You're still not hit, right?

535
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yeah.

536
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Hey, you're so good at this.

537
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Hey, you bastard.

538
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Hey, you bastard.

539
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You know what you're doing when you're hit properly, right?

540
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Hey, Kang Eun-gil.

541
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
What?

542
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
How many people are there?

543
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
What?

544
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
If I send this bastard, how many people are left in front of me?

545
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Two people.

546
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Two people.

547
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Two people.

548
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I can't fight if I send two more people.

549
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Yeah.
