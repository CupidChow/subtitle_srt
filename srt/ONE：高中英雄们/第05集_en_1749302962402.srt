00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,315
You're going to face it with confidence, okay?

188
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,916
Don't be afraid of these guys

Property? Uh, a medal?
Well, it'll be something like this

208

226
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,564
- Oh, really?

Choi Ji-hyeok and Nam Seung-sik too

312

It's been like that from the beginning
They weren't childish

00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:30,771
A beggar is coming in?

351
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,340
Is that because of circumstances?

352
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:36,644
The teacher gave permission

353
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,345
okay?

354
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,315
But could you please turn off?

355
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:43,484
Because that's my seat

356
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:48,489
[Geuljae's sigh]

357
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:49,490
(Geoljae) Sorry

358
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,226
I thought it was empty

359
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:53,394
are you okay

360
00:19:53,928 --> 00:19:54,995
That could be the case

361
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:57,264
But I'm sorry

362
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,466
lend me some money

363
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:03,504
(Seungsik) [Laughing] These days, I
Because I don't have money

364
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:05,272
There are many uses here and there

365
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:08,342
Help out our needy neighbors

366
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:11,779
[Seungsik's faint smile]

367
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:15,916
[Students chattering]

368
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:18,853
Is this okay?

369
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:21,989
We can communicate

370
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:26,827
Instead, I have a favor to ask.

371
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:28,562
[tensing music]
[Sound of a bill being tossed]

372
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,398
I want to be quiet for a while

373
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:35,503
Can you help me?

374
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,542
okay?

375
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:44,078
okay

376
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:46,747
Then I only pay 100,000 won a week

377
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:49,683
(Seungsik) If you don't have money

378
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:52,520
Hit with your body

379
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,024
[Creating music]

380
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:03,330

[Seungsik's powerful voice]
[thud]

383
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:09,303
Are you doing something too?

00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,274
[urgent music]
[Seungsik's powerful voice]

385
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,278
Got it

[Laughing] Mr.

390
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:27,521
I'm so pissed

391
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,190
Let's stop

392
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,191
[Seungsik's sigh]

393
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:31,325
Please

394
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:32,593
It won't work?

395
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:34,762
I feel like this today

396
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,997
Because it's so bad

397
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:38,332

(Teacher) This is it!

402
00:21:56,684 --> 00:21:58,953
You, Inma, have you been fighting since your first day at school?

403
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:02,089
[Seungsik's faint smile]

404
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,324
you

405
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,060
Know that you are lucky

406
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,296
(Teacher) Nam Seung-sik, Lee Geul-jae, you two

407
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:11,799
Come to the teachers' office right now.

408

409
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:15,769

[Laughing] Mr.

417
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,467

Hey, Hong Il-ah

420
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,046
Yes, brother

are you okay?

425
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,293
Yeah, it's okay

426
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:13,961
(together) I'm sorry

427
00:23:14,495 --> 00:23:16,497
(Student 8) Hey, because of you
I almost died

00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,535
[Meaningful music]

429
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,243
[Light sigh]

430
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:33,113
(Yoongi) Idiot
What does it feel like to come from a place like juvenile detention center?

431
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,982
(Hong Il) You will feel it just by looking at it

432
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,184
(Yoongi) Uigyeom

433
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:42,056
A transfer student came in the third year.
I heard you got into a fight with Nam Seung-sik

434
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:43,757
why?

435
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:44,792
(Hongil) Why, why?

436
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,961
Of course I'm trying to catch up with school

437
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:48,529
If you lay down Nam Seung-sik

438
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:50,898
Next up is Kim Ui-gyeom, you right?

439
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:52,900
Where should I go?

440
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:54,568
wait for a sec

441
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,871
(Yoongi) There's no need to fight right away

442
00:23:57,404 --> 00:23:59,006
You have to explore first

443
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:01,375
Let's go now

444
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:04,712
okay
[tensing music]

445
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:14,889
Are you going right now?

[Yoongi's whistle]

447
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:30,037
Is there a senior who transferred today?

448
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:33,107
(Yoongi) Ah

449
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:34,542
I can tell at a glance

450
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:37,945
Senior, I came here after hearing the rumor.

451
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:42,016
If you want to catch a school
Not senior Nam Seung-sik

452
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:44,985
I should have found Kim Ui-gyeom here

453
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:45,886
[Yoongi's laughter]

454
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:57,064
Let's talk in a quiet place

[Yi-gyeom's sigh]

456
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:13,714
Are you sure this isn't anonymous?

457
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:17,318
I think there is some misunderstanding.

458
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:19,553
I have no intention of fighting

459
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:22,756
Then as soon as you arrive
What was the fight with Nam Seung-sik about?

460
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,826
(Geoljae) I just stopped him because he was attacking me

461
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,928
[laughs]
Then let me block it too

462
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:31,098
[urgent music]

[sound of panic]

466
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:45,079
(Yoongi) Hey, Eui-gyeom

467
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:47,481
Hey, stop, stop, hey
You, you're not the one to fight

468
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:49,416
- (Yi-gyeom) Get out of the way
- Hey, listen to me, man.

469
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,584
Hey, even if we fight, it'll be later, okay?

470
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:51,652
(Yoon-ki) Please, huh?

471
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:52,853
I told you

472
00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:55,523
I have no intention of fighting

473
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,525
Don't touch

474
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:00,261
If I fight you die

475
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:02,696
[Yi-gyeom's heavy breathing]
(Yoongi) Oh, really, shit

476
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,265
Just stay still

477
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:07,434
What my senior said
I've heard it a lot since middle school

478
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:11,572
I apologize for what happened today

479
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:17,044
Uigyeom and I
I didn't mean to fight, I just

480
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:20,147
My senior also likes to use his fists
I thought he was a gangster

481
00:26:22,283 --> 00:26:23,284
sorry

482
00:26:26,353 --> 00:26:27,788
What you guys are doing

483
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:29,890
(Geoljae) Doing what gangsters do
What's different?

484
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,791
Different

485
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:32,860
We only pick on bad guys

486
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,495
(Yoongi) Stay still
[Geoljae's empty laughter]

487
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:35,396
It's fun

488
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:38,699
Who decides who the bad guys are?

489
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:41,702
Am I a bad guy or a good guy?

490
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:44,572
[Meaningful music]

491
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:46,040
you?

492
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:56,050
Those who use their fists
It doesn't always end well

493
00:26:58,352 --> 00:26:59,420
You have to experience it to know

494
00:27:00,588 --> 00:27:02,323
Experience it and feel it for yourself

495
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:07,995
[Yoon-ki's faint sigh]

496
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:16,704
(Yoongi) Wow, sir

497
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:18,539
I almost got sick of it, seeing this in person

498
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:19,707
Crazy, really

499
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:20,941
[Yoongi's laughter]

500
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:22,276
Is that kid that tall?

501
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,778
Kim Ui-gyeom couldn't win even if 10 people attacked him

502
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:26,981
Who will be Senior Geuljae in the future?
When you find out

503
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:29,416
At our school
There won't be a single one of you who will nag

504
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:32,019
The school will be quiet

505
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:32,987
[Yoongi's laughter]

506
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:34,522
That's why you have to have strength

507
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:36,891
[Yoongi's laughter]

508
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,394
[Yoongi's elasticity]

509
00:27:41,595 --> 00:27:42,496
(Seungsik) So

510
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,031
You said you didn't fight?

511
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:45,266
(Hongil) Yes

512
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:47,168
Yeah, that transfer student

513
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:50,204
He said he had no intention of fighting.

514
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:51,238
[Seungsik's empty laughter]

515
00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:52,840
what

516
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:55,442
Why are the kids suddenly like this?

517
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,379
Do you respect other people's feelings?

518
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:01,982
[Seungsik's empty laughter]
[Hong-il's awkward laugh]

519
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:02,883
(Sungwook) Seungsik

520
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:06,587
Are you having fun?

521
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:10,457
You little brat, you got stepped on by a first grader.
There was a rumor going around the school.

522
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:12,960
(Seungsik) Really?

523
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:16,797
But you got stepped on by a first-year student
Haven't you heard the rumor?

524
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:19,700
(Yi-gyeom) Anonymous?

525
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:23,904
(Yoongi) Oh, this is
It's a school that few people know about.

526
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:27,908
It's a kind of model school.
It's a really tough school

527
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,611
Because juvenile crime is so rampant

528
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:32,913
The juvenile detention center can't handle it.

529
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,316
Because all the bad guys are gathered in one place

530
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:36,584
You only learn worse things

531
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:37,518
Wouldn't that be so?

532
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:41,055
So, we need to rehabilitate the kids.
Is it okay to train ex-convicts?

533
00:28:41,055 --> 00:28:42,556
Well, the Ministry of Justice is doing this

534
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,992
It's like a weird demonstration school
It's already been made

535
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:46,894
[Meaningful music]
There are several schools like this across the country.

536
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:50,331
This isn't even a juvenile detention center
It's not even school

537
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:52,766
Anyway, the teachers here

538
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:55,069
Rather, just there
Encourage a fighting atmosphere

539
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:58,639
[noisy fighting sounds]
They just rank the kids by fighting rank and manage them like that.

540
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,042
Do you know Samcheong Education Corps?

541
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:03,144
uh

542
00:29:03,144 --> 00:29:04,678
(Yoon-ki) That, in the past
Arrest the thugs

543
00:29:04,678 --> 00:29:05,613
I was treated like a dog

544
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:07,148
You can think of it as the same thing

545
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:09,950
But the anonymous
You have to fight every day

546
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,118
They said we have no choice but to fight

547
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:14,321
If you can't fight there

548
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:17,024
I'm completely broke
I have to live like a loner

549
00:29:17,258 --> 00:29:19,393
But senior Geuljae
A regular high school like ours

550
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:20,828
That I transferred to a new school

551
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:21,929
[Student 9's groan]

552
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:24,365
There at the anonymous high school
It means that I ate a lot

553
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,101
If you eat there, it's the best
I can transfer schools

554
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:27,935
General high school

555
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:31,105
So I'm always thinking about transferring schools
They fight so hard that it makes blood boil

556
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:32,239
Understand?

557
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:35,009
[Yoongi's sigh]

558
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:38,345
Wow, sir, hey

559
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:39,513
He's senior Geuljae

560
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,982
Ha, if we had a senior like that on our side

561
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:44,084
There really is nothing to be afraid of in this world, really

562
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:45,953
to?

563
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,355
[tensing music]

564
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:52,293
[Seongwook and Seungsik's faint smile]

565
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:53,828
What is this situation, what is this?

566
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,998
[exciting music]

567
00:29:58,098 --> 00:29:58,933
(Seungsik) Hey, it's hot!

568
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:00,067
(Sungwook) Hey, catch that kid!

569
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:02,236
(Yoongi) Wow, man, daebak, man

570
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:03,571
Hey, let's go see it quickly.

571
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:04,538
Hurry up and get to work, let's go

572
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:06,373
Hey, let's go see it, quickly
Hurry up, hurry up, come quickly

573
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:10,311
[The heavy breathing of the bullies]

574
00:30:16,951 --> 00:30:18,953
[Creating music]

575
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:23,357
[Seungsik's heavy breathing]
[The bullies' urgent voices]

576
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,498
(Iljin 4) Hey!

577
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:32,733
[Seungsik's heavy breathing]

578
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:34,668
(Seungsik) Huh?

579
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:39,673
[Struggling] Ah, sir

580
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:43,978
[interesting music]

581
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:44,912
what?

582
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:46,647
Have you been waiting?

583
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:48,382
(Iljin 4) Oh my

584
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,252
Do you really have to see it through to the end?

585
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,088
[Seungsik's laughter]

586
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,157
(Seungsik) Isn't it cool?

587
00:30:56,457 --> 00:30:58,058
As expected, it's an anonymous legend

588
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:00,628
I didn't know you were that famous

589
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:02,997
how

590
00:31:03,797 --> 00:31:05,366
Shouldn't you play a game with me?

591
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:08,669
[Geuljae's sigh]

592
00:31:09,436 --> 00:31:10,771
Lastly I say

593
00:31:11,806 --> 00:31:13,407
I'll pretend not to be at school

594
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:17,178
So let's stop here

595
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:19,079
[laugh]

596
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:21,248
Charisma kills

597
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:23,751
But it's already too late

598
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:26,453
Because this is my pride

I apologize again

It looked dangerous

You know too?

634
00:33:07,054 --> 00:33:09,190
Oh, but don't look at it so negatively.

635
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,457
My senior said that

636
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:11,525
You have to experience it to know

637
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:13,861
We are experiencing this right now too.
[laugh]

638
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:18,265
(Yoon-ki) Oh, but senior
You are the kind of person who should not cause accidents

639
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:20,167
If the fight we had just now gets rumored at school

640
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,669

Senior, I'll just do it once
When you need help

644

If you could help me just once
Can't you? Yes?

645
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:35,049
Are you threatening me now?

Senior, then tell me
You just owe me one debt, okay?

649
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:43,357
Just once, okay?

Am I a bad guy or a good guy?

you?

(Instructor) Okay, each one
Should I differentiate with respect to t?

660
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:14,922
Okay, then

You can ask first

[heavy music]
Why did you do that, what did you do?

679
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:11,745
I'm asking you

680
00:35:12,012 --> 00:35:14,081
Can't we talk it out without hitting?

681
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:16,717
You, get out

now!

Your teaching style

687
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:34,568
Makes the kid more wrong
Don't you think so?

688
00:35:36,737 --> 00:35:37,638
what?

689
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:41,075
