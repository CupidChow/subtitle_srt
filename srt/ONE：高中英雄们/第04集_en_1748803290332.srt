1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Yu-kyung.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,000
Yu-kyung, wake up.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You're so mean.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey, hey, you're so mean.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm going to end this here.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm getting so tired.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Stop it.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hey.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll take care of your school life from now on.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hey, come here.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Then the next step is you.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually, I was interested in you, too.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What do you think?

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hey, let's have fun.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's play.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's play.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm a coward.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't want to be kicked out.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're so mean.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Are you ready?

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What are you doing?

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm alive.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What did you say?

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm alive.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you're so mean, I'm going to die.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm going to wait a little longer.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's go.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's go.

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm going to kill you just once more.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What are you going to do?

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hey, stop it.

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I have a problem with my throat.

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll kill you in a minute.

34
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What are you doing?

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What the hell are you doing?

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You have two left in this school, right?

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:59,000
One of them is cleaning up.

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Who's cleaning up?

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll...

42
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Kim Yu-kyung.

43
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's going to be fun.

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's look around and help each other.

45
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to kill you.

46
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm going to kill you.

47
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm going to kill you.

48
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm going to kill you.

49
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What the hell.

50
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Nam Sik-yi.

51
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Your nose is a little bit serious.

52
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's give up.

53
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, my.

54
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're so cute.

55
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You have to break one leg of the blue one.

56
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wait a minute.

57
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What the hell.

58
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What the hell.

59
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What the hell.

60
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What the hell.

61
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, my.

62
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You started it on purpose.

63
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Don't stop me.

64
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm going to drink.

65
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's hard to drink.

66
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, my.

67
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, my.

68
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I told you.

70
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I told you.

71
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm going to kill you just once.

72
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Hey.

73
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hey.

74
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm warning you.

75
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Hey.

76
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Hey.

77
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Hey.

78
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
How was the airport?

79
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Teacher.

80
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I can't do this.

81
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Please help me.

82
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If you have any memories that you didn't want to remember and remember, I hope you look at it rather than run away.

83
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sure you're going to try to get rid of the things you couldn't do.

84
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Hey.

85
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Hey.

86
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Hey.

87
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hey, let's get it.

88
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't have to look at the things that are being stolen.

89
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Now you're doing what you want.

90
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's all over.

91
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Now you're not going to touch it.

92
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You can focus on studying again.

93
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, I'm getting tired.

94
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hey, Kim.

95
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Kim.

96
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Kim.

97
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Kim.

98
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yes.

99
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What do you think?

100
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You told me to focus on the teacher.

102
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Are you out of your mind?

103
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What's the problem?

104
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Focus.

105
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What are you thinking about?

106
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hey, aren't you going to do this?

107
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're so ridiculous.

109
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What are you doing?

110
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you want to be a burden to the teacher?

111
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You son of a bitch.

112
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't go to the academy.

113
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Isn't this your life?

114
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Is it my life?

115
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Don't do that.

116
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Get out.

117
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yes.

118
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Hey, hey, hey.

119
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Hey, Kim.

120
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Kim, how did you suddenly get up in class?

121
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Huh?

122
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Why?

123
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The teacher told me to go out first.

124
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But he just said he was out.

125
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
My dad said he was studying more systematically.

126
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I thought that was right.

127
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I didn't know the grade recently, so I said I'd be fine someday.

128
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Kim, are you listening to me now?

129
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
No.

130
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I told you when I was in this school.

131
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You were at the end of the cliff.

132
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You're going to run away whenever you get a driver's license?

133
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
No.

134
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Then why did you do that in the academy?

135
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'll call the academy.

137
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Go to the hospital and apologize yourself.

138
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Okay?

139
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay.

140
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You can't do this again.

141
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Again.

142
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes.

143
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Study.

144
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes.

145
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Do you want a bite?

146
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What's up?

147
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The atmosphere is a little strong.

148
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What's up?

149
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Why did they say something?

150
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Who?

151
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Male students?

152
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No.

153
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's time to lower your voice a little.

154
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why?

155
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Did you expect it?

156
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What did you say?

157
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We're not done yet.

158
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
We're going to start now.

159
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What?

160
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The bad guys in the world are so bad.

161
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
For example, you called Seomunggu here.

162
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm a bad guy.

163
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What's wrong with you?

164
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Don't eat.

165
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Get rid of it.

166
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We're preparing for the live broadcast.

167
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Go home safely.

168
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Did you hear that?

169
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Let's finish it quickly.

170
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Get rid of this bastard.

171
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Let's go home safely.

172
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Don't do that.

173
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Seomunggu, come here.

174
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Don't do that.

175
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Kim Nam-yeol, you're a very insolent sadist.

176
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He's a very annoying bastard who's stressed out because he's studying.

177
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's not a single or two times like this.

178
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But your dad covers it all up.

179
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I guess the professor's power is really good.

180
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So what are you going to do?

181
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
We're going to catch him.

182
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What?

183
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You like it.

184
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You're scolding me for being bad.

185
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
We're going to the school garden now.

186
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What are you doing?

187
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh, don't make me eat.

188
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You have to do what you want to do.

189
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Are you crazy?

190
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You're coming out strong.

191
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You're going to hit me, too.

192
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Kang Hyun-gi.

193
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Do you want to die?

194
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Hey, Yook-yeom.

196
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Thank you.

197
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Who is it?

198
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm in the same school.

199
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
After you hit Hong-il last time, they don't bother me anymore.

200
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So I wanted to say thank you.

201
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Hey, you don't have to thank me.

202
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He didn't do it for you.

203
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Our stupid school first place doesn't have a heart for others.

204
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I just fought to relieve my stress.

205
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I can't give it to my dad.

206
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Go.

207
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I guess my bad-looking guy is like that.

208
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll eat it.

209
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Thank you.

210
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
If you meet your parents and get a face, you can go to college later.

211
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's why my grandfather sent me a first-class certificate.

212
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yes.

213
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Among the people who come with us today, there are a lot of kids who are ready to go.

214
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Go and pack your things and listen to the know-how.

215
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Huh?

216
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes.

217
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This way.

219
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Oh, the team representative.

220
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh, director.

221
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
How are you?

222
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Oh, I'm...

223
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm the director.

224
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh, okay.

225
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
This way.

226
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm glad to see you, director.

227
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Yes.

228
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You're still beautiful.

229
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's because the team representative takes good care of you.

230
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Oh, you're a good-looking guy.

231
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Oh, the second brother of Su-gyeom's younger brother.

232
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yes.

233
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Please say hello to the team representative who helps your mom a lot.

234
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Hello.

235
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Da-rim.

236
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yes.

237
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You're beautiful.

238
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm sorry, director.

239
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Did you say that I'm a good-looking guy?

241
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh, you're a good-looking guy.

242
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Come to our school hard.

243
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yes.

244
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Of course, I'm going to go because I'm here.

245
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Oh, okay.

246
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
My son, the team representative.

247
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Hello.

248
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Oh, you're the team representative.

249
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Oh, let's catch the handgun.

250
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Nice to meet you.

251
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I saw the TV a few days ago.

252
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
The AI school report is a kidnapping for the disabled students.

253
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I was wondering if that young man would think that way.

254
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I got hurt once a month, but I realized that there was no time for healing at school.

255
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
That's why I made it.

256
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Oh, right.

257
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You got hurt while doing the Muay Thai, right?

258
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yes, that's right.

259
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Muay Thai?

260
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yes.

261
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You exercise, take care of your hands.

262
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You're amazing.

263
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You're amazing.

264
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You're amazing.

265
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You're amazing.

266
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Say hello to the medical school.

267
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Nice to meet you.

268
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Sir, what happened to the five-star crime?

269
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's a case of the school's opening.

270
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
No.

271
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It's still that dirty rumor.

272
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
There's a video.

273
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Music.

274
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
No.

275
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's really terrible that someone who made an app for disabled people made a fire.

276
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Just win.

277
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's still that dirty rumor.

278
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Sir.

279
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We went into the room of that son.

280
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:40,000
In fact, that son of ours committed suicide in that room.

281
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Are you out of your mind right now?

282
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's such an important and good place to be.

283
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That senior is a bully who hits and takes money.

284
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeom.

285
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I saw it myself.

286
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
If you do it, you'll...

287
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Yeom.

288
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
To a person who's good at it, you always follow that strange rumor.

289
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's not a rumor.

290
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I saw it myself.

291
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeom.

292
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Do you think the world is just a person who takes money and takes money?

293
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
No, man.

294
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The world is so complicated and cold.

295
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Look at others.

296
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
How awkward it is to be in such a rumor.

297
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Do you know what I'm doing here?

298
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm taking you here to learn that attitude.

299
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Let's go.

300
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Go and apologize to others.

301
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
This is the place you're going to live.

302
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Why?

303
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Why should I do that?

304
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I don't want to be like that bad guy.

305
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Kim Haekyung.

306
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I don't want to be the same person.

307
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Kim Haekyung.

308
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I want you to be like me.

309
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Even if you do that?

310
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I don't want to be like that.

311
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
How could you?

312
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I've been doing that for a month after I joined the army.

313
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Now that I think about it,

314
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
for the past month,

315
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
our eldest son has been doing this for a month.

316
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
He's been doing this for a month.

317
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
For the past month,

320
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
our eldest son has sent me a signal to help me a few times.

321
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But I couldn't notice at all.

322
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
At that time,

323
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I would have liked to have found out.

324
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Kim Haekyung.

325
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Kim Haekyung.

326
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Lee Kyung.

327
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Let's go.

328
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
What?

329
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Let's go get him.

330
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Jungwon.

331
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Jungwon.

332
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Where's Jungwon?

333
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Jungwon.

334
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Are you going to sit in the police station and do something?

335
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Hey, you're still a human.

336
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Are you going to sit in the police station and do something?

337
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It smells like a joke.

338
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
That's right.

339
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You're not here, are you?

340
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm here, so I'm going to have a bathroom at school.

341
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Oh, here it is.

342
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Open the door.

343
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Before you kill me.

344
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I feel a little bad.

345
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
If you don't open the door, you might really kill yourself.

346
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Stand here.

347
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You know, right?

348
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You can avoid it.

349
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Oh, Choi Jungwon.

350
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You didn't avoid it this time.

351
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh, fuck.

352
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's not fun.

353
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Let's see how it goes after school.

354
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You're a man.

355
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Don't stop.

356
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
What's going on?

357
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Jungwon.

358
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm dying.

359
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

360
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I need to breathe.

361
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Hey, wake up, wake up.

362
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I need to breathe.

363
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

364
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I need to breathe.

365
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Are you okay?

366
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Are you okay?

367
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It hurts, so stop it.

368
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Stop it.

369
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's not over yet.

370
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Hey, come out.

371
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Come out, come out.

372
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Jungwon.

373
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Jungwon.

374
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
These days, you don't get tired of this TV.

375
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Hurry up and get on the plane.

376
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You know how to move, right?

377
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm sorry.

379
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Hey, did you avoid it?

381
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Look at the flag.

382
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
What's wrong with you?

383
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Just get rid of it.

384
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Get rid of it.

385
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I'm breaking your arm.

386
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Nam Yeob.

387
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Nam Yeob.

388
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
What's going on?

389
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Is there a person here?

390
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Oh, there he is.

391
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm sorry.
