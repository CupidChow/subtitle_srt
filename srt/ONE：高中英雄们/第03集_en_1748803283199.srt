1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
The hospital in Donggwang was 25 million won last September.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,040
It was 21.7 million won in September last year.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,000
How much was the total?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,440
The total was 23.2 million won in August last month.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,480
You're good.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,840
You're good.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,040
Who's the new hospital?

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,040
Yes, it's me.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,040
Chief Cho.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,040
Choi Young-kyu.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,040
Yes.

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,040
I went to the new hospital and hit the JK Bioade.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
Did you hit the medicine?

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,040
Hey, what are you doing there?

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,040
I'm giving you a bobbin card.

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,040
Use the bobbin card.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,040
Why didn't you use it?

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,040
Someone stop you?

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
I'll do well.

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,040
You follow me to the night market.

22
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Yes.

23
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,040
You guys know how much the price of the medicine was in the JK Bioade.

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,040
You guys didn't even go out.

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,040
You were sitting in the desk.

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,040
Don't you have any oil?

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Do you think I'm the only one here?

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
Chief Kim.

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Yes.

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,040
Do you know that you're expanding with the video medicine at the Sobundae Hospital?

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
Yes.

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,040
You can see the MRI, CT, X-ray, angio, and photovoltape there.

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,040
If you miss this, all of you will die.

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,040
If you cry, you'll be hit by a bat.

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Chief Kim.

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Yes.

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
If you don't talk to me this month, you...

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,040
You'll go to the night market and get 1.5% off.

39
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Yes, sir.

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Get out.

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Move quickly.

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Yes, sir.

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,040
You're coming to the weekend, right?

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,040
You know, the kids are busy at the academy these days.

45
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
So?

46
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
What?

47
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,040
You're coming to the weekend, right?

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,040
I'm busy these days.

49
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
So?

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
What?

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
You're coming to the weekend, right?

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
Yes.

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Okay.

54
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,040
Come to the weekend.

55
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Bring your aunt and brother-in-law.

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Yes.

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,040
You're doing well at the academy, right?

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Yes.

59
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,040
I'm always doing well.

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
I'm doing well.

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Hey, Kyung-yoon!

62
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
What?

63
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
How many people are there?

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
What?

65
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,040
I'm the one who's going to the weekend.

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Kyung-yoon!

67
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
What?

68
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,040
If I send this bastard, how many people are there?

69
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Two people!

70
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,040
If I send more people, I won't be able to fight.

71
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Hey!

72
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Hey, hey, hey!

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Hey!

74
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Hey!

75
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
You little bastard!

76
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

77
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
You're going to get caught, right?

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Come here.

79
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Hey, hey, hey!

80
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
You're so mean.

81
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Are you kidding me?

82
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,040
If you run to him, you'll be punished.

83
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Hey!

84
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
Hey!

85
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
That's it.

86
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Hey!

87
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
You're a coward.

88
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
You're too mean.

89
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Die.

90
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Are you scared now?

91
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,040
I should have told you the truth.

92
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Hey!

93
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Kim, Kim Sung-joon!

94
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Hey!

95
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Let's use this to kill him.

96
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Let go of me.

97
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Are you crazy?

98
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Are you crazy?

99
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Hey, hey, stop it.

100
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
What are you doing?

101
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
It's a little bit of a mess.

102
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Kim Sung-joon, you're out of your mind, right?

103
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Yeah.

104
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
This bastard is crazy.

105
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Just...

106
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Hey!

107
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
Hey!

108
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Hey!

109
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Hey!

110
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Hey!

111
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Stop it.

112
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
Stop it.

113
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Stop it.

114
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,040
I'm annoyed.

115
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Kim, Sung-joon, do you want to see the combination?

116
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
I'll show you instead.

117
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Hey!

118
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,040
This bastard is a coward like you.

119
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
This bastard is crazy.

120
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Let's go.

121
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Let's go.

122
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
What the hell is this bastard?

123
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,040
He won the first game of the game with a single-man win.

124
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,040
He won't be beaten up by a coward.

125
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,040
If Jong-hyun is caught by the seniors,

126
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
I won't be looking around.

127
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
What?

128
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Is this a bastard?

129
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
If he's not caught,

130
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,040
you should come here first.

131
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
You should have reported to 112.

132
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Are you okay?

133
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,040
I don't think this is the end of the housework.

134
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
What do you want to do?

135
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Please stop at this point.

136
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
I think it's going to be good.

137
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Isn't it going to be a sample room?

138
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Who are the rest?

139
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Oh.

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
School students.

141
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Nam Seung-sik, He Sung-wook.

142
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
How much time do you have left?

143
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Why, are you going now?

144
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,040
I'm going to play basketball with my friends.

145
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Hey, don't go.

146
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm going to play basketball with my friends.

147
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
How much time do you have left?

148
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,240
Why? Are you going now?

149
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,740
You just fought with that crazy guy.

150
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,580
Oh, it's Byung-hoon.

151
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,760
Don't look for me anymore.

152
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,920
Get tired of this.

153
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,760
What are you talking about?

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,600
I don't think this is right.

155
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,080
Now you guys go and play.

156
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,980
You know, I've been following the seniors for a long time.

157
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,080
I can't stay here.

158
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,380
Hey, Seung-joon.

159
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,840
Oh Jung-min, hello.

160
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,200
Yoon Jung-tae.

161
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,920
Let me play for you.

162
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,840
Back in my house.

163
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,500
Don't you see your brother, Peike?

164
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
What?

165
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
I have something to tell you.

166
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Thank you.

167
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Hello.

168
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Hello, sir.

169
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Hello, sir.

170
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,500
I have something important to tell you.

171
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Hey, are you okay?

172
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Are you sick?

173
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm fine.

174
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
I don't think so.

175
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Let's go to the bathroom. I'll take you there.

176
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,500
No, I'm really fine.

177
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
What's wrong?

178
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Where's the classroom?

179
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
I'll take you there.

180
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Thank you.

181
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Mr. Nam Seum.

182
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Why didn't you come to the classroom yesterday?

183
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Did you have a meal?

184
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,500
I was going to go to the classroom to see you today.

185
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
I saw a sick leg here.

186
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I'll take you to the classroom.

187
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
See you later, sir.

188
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
What the heck?

189
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Okay.

190
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Let's go.

191
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
3rd grade?

192
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Yes.

193
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
I'll live if I can help you with the same school.

194
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Thank you.

195
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Wait.

196
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
I want some money.

197
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
I said I'd check, but you're not here.

198
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I don't have money to buy drinks.

199
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
As you can see, I can't buy shoes.

200
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
I'll take you there.

201
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
I'll take you there.

202
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Thank you.

203
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
I'll see you again next time.

204
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Let's go to the classroom.

205
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
I'm going to take a test today.

206
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Don't be nervous.

207
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
You can do whatever you want.

208
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
I'll take you there.

209
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Hey, you.

210
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Hey, you.

211
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Hey, you.

212
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Yes.

213
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
You're hurt, right?

214
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,500
How could you get a top in the class?

215
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Your dad is so aggressive.

216
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
You don't look like you're being mean.

217
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Focus.

218
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Sung-ah.

219
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Yes.

220
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Look at him.

221
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
You crazy bastard.

222
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
That bastard.

223
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
That bastard with a phone.

224
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Hey, Kim Yu-kyung.

225
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Hey, friend.

226
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Are you all here?

227
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Thanks to you, I drank well.

228
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Hey.

229
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
I won't hit you, so come here.

230
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Let's talk for a minute.

231
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
Are you one of those two?

232
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
What is he saying?

233
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,500
I think he's asking if you're the strongest in our school.

234
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
You're talking so nicely.

235
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
You said you'd organize our kids one by one.

236
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Let's see why.

237
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Should we do it here?

238
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
What?

239
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Hey.

240
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
You can't go home with me if you fight with me.

241
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
I'm not here to fight today.

242
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
I'm nervous.

243
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
You can sleep.

244
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Let's talk for a bit.

245
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Kim Yu-kyung.

246
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
It's late. Get on the car.

247
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Dad's here.

248
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Kim Yu-kyung.

249
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Take off your headphones.

250
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Who were they?

251
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Are they friends?

252
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
No.

253
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,500
They just pretend to know each other.

254
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
They don't seem to be in good shape.

255
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Kim Yu-kyung.

256
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Yes?

257
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
There are two types of power.

258
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
One-way power and one-way ability.

259
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Those who are in the first-class power and are in the middle of it

260
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
can never get the ability to keep going.

261
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,500
You have to have the ability to keep going.

262
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Okay?

263
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Yes.

264
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Dad, where are we going now?

265
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Let's make a choice.

266
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Oh, you're the professor this week.

267
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
That's right.

268
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I remember you were the professor when you started to get fat.

269
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Yes.

270
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,500
So I asked the chairman to come to the office to make a decision this weekend.

271
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
We can't even go home at this hour.

272
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
You know everything.

273
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,500
If we were the professor, we would have come to help you.

274
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
You've seen a lot of professors.

275
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
You're healthy, right?

276
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Of course.

277
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
You'll be healthier than me.

278
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,500
You have to be healthier, the chairman.

279
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Okay.

280
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
I'll be the chairman.

281
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Okay.

282
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Here.

283
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,500
You're tall and your shoulders are all broken.

284
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
You're all grown up now.

285
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
You won't know if you look outside.

286
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I heard that your son will be the chairman of the department of science.

287
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
How are you doing?

288
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Of course.

289
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I'm doing well.

290
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,500
I want to go to school as soon as possible.

291
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,500
There are a lot of fun things to do when you go to school.

292
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,500
What? You went to the Korean school at the men's school?

293
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Yes.

294
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
I didn't come to fight.

295
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Then you went to see your face?

296
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
What are you talking about?

297
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
You're not going to fight when you go out, right?

298
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
I don't think you look that great.

299
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,500
You're not in good condition.

300
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Huh?

301
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
You fought yesterday.

302
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,500
You have to avoid fighting until your body recovers completely.

303
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
You have to fight only in the best condition.

304
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
That's the trend.

305
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Uh-huh.

306
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Hey.

307
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Let's go to the classroom because we can see the teachers.

308
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
If you run away, all your friends will die.

309
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
What is this?

310
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Is this expensive?

311
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Don't worry.

312
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
I'm not interested in that.

313
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Let's play together.

314
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
I like you.

315
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Then you don't have to fight.

316
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Let's play together.

317
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
How is it?

318
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
What is it about playing together?

319
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Look at them.

320
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
They can't even say a word.

321
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,500
You're not the one who wants to be that fat.

322
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
You can be a playground for school too.

323
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
I'll move wherever you want.

324
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Are you proud of that?

325
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
I feel good.

326
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
It's a special power.

327
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,500
If you have the strength, you can be free and you can do it at home.

328
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,500
This is the same as you.

329
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
I'm saying it out loud.

330
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
You're a bully.

331
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
You're a bully.

332
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
You're a bully.

333
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
You're a bully.

334
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
You're a bully.

335
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
What are you talking about?

336
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
You're a bully.

337
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
I'm sorry.

338
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Why don't you drink?

339
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
I'm buying it for you.

340
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Drink it.

341
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
You're drunk.

342
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Let's go.

343
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Can you turn it off?

344
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
Let's see.

345
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Let's go.

346
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
You did a good job.

347
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Are you just going to leave him alone?

348
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Then what?

349
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,500
You're a bully.

350
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
It would be fun to play together.

351
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Don't you think I'm a bully?

352
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
There's no cheap way.

353
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
If you put that kid on, they won't get a chance.

354
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,500
I'll fix it if I don't know how much.

355
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Okay.

356
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Congratulations on your birthday, father.

357
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,500
My son came here for us.

358
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Congratulations on your birthday, father.

359
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Congratulations, father.

360
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
I prepared this.

361
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Take care of your health.

362
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
I'm going to the living room.

363
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
Let's go in.

364
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Hello.

365
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Hello.

366
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
Let's have a drink.

367
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Here.

368
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Have a good meal.

369
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Eat well.

370
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Eat well.

371
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Oh, Cheoyoung.

372
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,500
Congratulations on your internal affairs.

373
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
What are you doing?

374
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
My house is full of food.

375
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,500
I don't care about my dad or daughter.

376
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,500
But I'm glad you're a doctor.

377
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,500
If you were a doctor, I would have been full of food with you.

378
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
Right?

379
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
You said you signed with Hanjin Hospital.

380
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Oh.

381
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Father, please give me your leg.

382
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
I'll give you a heart attack.

383
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
What's the matter with you?

384
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Are you talking to me?

385
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Yes.

386
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Compared to the promotion, the level of the surgery is very low.

387
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Why do you have to give me an important time?

388
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
I still don't understand.

389
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,500
I thought it was better for you, father.

390
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,500
It will be more advantageous for the internal affairs.

391
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Of course, you should do that.

392
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,500
I'm afraid of the economy and I'm leaving that good school.

393
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,500
I'm sending you to the school where the sheep are drawing a special line.

394
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Grandpa, I like this school.

395
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Father, I asked you to tell me that the tattoo artist is going to congratulate you.

396
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,500
I heard the tattoo artist went to the store to wear it today.

397
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Really?

398
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,500
I heard that the tattoo artist is leaving.

399
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,500
The tattoo artist is leaving.

400
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
I'm sorry.

401
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
I'm sorry.

402
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
I'm sorry.

403
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
I'm sorry.

404
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:38,500
The tattoo artist is good at the body without any mistakes.

405
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,500
It's not as good as you think.

406
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,500
You know your score well.

407
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Just say that.

408
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,500
The tattoo artist is a really good person.

409
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:09,500
If you don't tell me, your score will be ruined.

410
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Do you know what that is?

411
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Oh, it's a fake.

412
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Grandpa, I'm still a minor.

413
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,500
You're learning to drink from an adult, right?

414
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,500
It's delicious when you give it to an adult.

415
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Yes, I'm the one who's going to leave.

417
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Your father didn't understand that well.

418
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,500
He thought he was a coward.

419
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,500
He thought he was going to do his job, so he ran away.

420
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Look at where he came back.

421
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,500
He could have gone to a higher place.

422
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Look at it now.

423
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,500
You can't do anything without this help.

424
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:02,500
You have to endure the moment you want to run away.

425
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,500
Your father and brother couldn't endure that moment.

426
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:14,500
You have to endure that moment to be a coward.

427
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Now this is the only thing left for you.

428
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,500
You, Gye-min.

429
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,500
Go back to the island.

430
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Pardon?

431
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,500
I have a question for you.

432
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,500
People don't live alone.

433
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:43,500
You can go to a higher place if you survive there.

434
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,500
What's not enough for you?

435
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,500
You liked it, too.

436
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,500
It's a place where you lived.

437
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Grandpa.

438
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:14,500
If I go there again, I think I'm going to die.

439
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:24,500
What?

440
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Your father is ruining you.

441
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
What did you do when you were a kid?

442
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
You didn't do anything.

443
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
You did everything I told you to do.

444
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,500
You're so mean.

445
00:31:40,500 --> 00:32:08,500
I'm sorry.

446
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:36,500
Brother.

447
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Brother.

448
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Brother.

449
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:06,500
Brother.

450
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Brother.

451
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Brother.

452
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:36,500
Brother.

453
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Father.

454
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
But what if you drink to him?

455
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
He's a minor.

456
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
A man should be raised strong.

457
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,500
He's weak in both M.E.A.P.

458
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,500
He can't even have a son.

459
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
He doesn't even let Sukyubin go like that.

460
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Father.

461
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
Say something.

462
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Father, go.

463
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,500
Go in.

464
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,500
I'm going to protect you.

465
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Father.

466
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
What a loser.

467
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
What's this?

468
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,500
Father, please.

469
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Father.

470
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Hey, it's not working yet.

471
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
You didn't come out yet.

472
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
It's not easy to see.

473
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Let's just leave it.

474
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Hey, how many times do you have to do this?

475
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Stop.

476
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
Hey, stop.

477
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
You can't do this, you bastard.

478
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
You're going to get kicked out.

479
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Get out of here.

480
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

481
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Tell me.

482
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,500
I'm getting kicked out.

483
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,500
What?

484
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
If you get kicked out by those guys,

485
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
I'll get kicked out.

486
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Hey, get out of here.

487
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:32,500
It's better if you get out of here quickly.

488
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Kim Ikyeom.

489
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
Did you change your mind?

490
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Yeah.

491
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
I thought you would drink some coke.

492
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
I regret it.

493
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Really?

494
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Here, drink.

495
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,500
You bought this too.

496
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Thank you for the fight.

497
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,500
I was really worried about you.

498
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:22,500
I was worried you wouldn't fight with me.

499
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Should I do it here?

500
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
You bastard.

501
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
I'm sorry for the coke.

502
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Let's go out.

503
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:47,500
You're the one who's giving me back what I received.

504
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:53,500
You're no joke.

505
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,500
You're a bastard.

506
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Hey, Nam Seung-sik.

507
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
Hello, sir.

508
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,500
You said you wouldn't let me go if you let me go.

509
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,500
How many times are you a coward?

510
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
I'm sorry, sir.

511
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Don't do this.

512
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,500
What's wrong with your hair?

513
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
What's wrong with your hair?

514
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Is it coke?

515
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Yes, I'll clean it up.

516
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,500
I'm sorry.

517
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,500
I'll let you go.

518
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Are you feeling better?

519
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,500
You're the last one.

520
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Thank you so much, sir.

521
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
What are they?

522
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,500
They're the juniors who came to get the award.

523
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
To you?

524
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Yes.

525
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Now, juniors.

526
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Go back to your classroom.

527
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:12,500
The rest of the life counseling is next time.

528
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Come to the band room for lunch.

529
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:24,500
If you run away, you'll be killed.

530
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:35,500
I'm sorry.

531
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:43,500
I have a Korean identity.

532
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:49,500
Shouldn't you ask me again?

533
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Kim Kyu-young.

534
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
I'll ask you for the last time.

535
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Are you going to be surprised with me?

536
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,500
Or just die here?

537
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Think about it.

538
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Until you're done with this.

539
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
Let's go.

540
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Complete.

541
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,500
The answer?

542
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Let's finish it and go.

543
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:46,500
Study hard.

544
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,500
Okay.

545
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Let's go.

546
00:39:51,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Let's go.

547
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Let's go.

548
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Let's go.

549
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Do you know that you're not good at playing football?

550
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:51,500
I'm not good at playing football.

551
00:40:51,500 --> 00:41:01,500
Hey, you're going to die.

552
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Hey, you.

553
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
It's not fun.

554
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:10,500
I'm going to end here.

555
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,500
Hey, you.

556
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
Hey, you.

557
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Get your hands off me.

558
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,500
What's wrong with you?

559
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Hey, you.

560
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Hey, you.

561
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Hey, you.

562
