Property? Uh, a medal?
Well, it'll be something like this

Choi Ji-hyeok and Nam Seung-sik too

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,340
Is that because of circumstances?

351
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,640
The teacher gave permission

352
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,350
okay?

353
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,320
But could you please turn off?

354
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,480
Because that's my seat

355
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,490
[Geuljae's sigh]

356
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,490
(Geoljae) Sorry

357
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,230
I thought it was empty

358
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,390
are you okay

359
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,000
That could be the case

360
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,260
But I'm sorry

361
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,470
lend me some money

362
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,500
(Seungsik) [Laughing] These days, I
Because I don't have money

363
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,270
There are many uses here and there

364
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,340
Help out our needy neighbors

365
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,780

[Students chattering]

367
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,850
Is this okay?

368
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,990
We can communicate

369
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,830
Instead, I have a favor to ask.

370
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,560
[tensing music]
[Sound of a bill being tossed]

371
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,400
I want to be quiet for a while

372
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,500
Can you help me?

373
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,540
okay?

374
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,080
okay

375
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,750
Then I only pay 100,000 won a week

376
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,680
(Seungsik) If you don't have money

377
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,520
Hit with your body

Are you doing something too?

[urgent music]
[Seungsik's powerful voice]

384
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,280
Got it

[Laughing] Mr.

389
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,520
I'm so pissed

390
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,190
Let's stop

391
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,190
[Seungsik's sigh]

392
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,330
Please

393
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,590
It won't work?

394
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,760
I feel like this today

395
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,000
Because it's so bad

396
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,330

(Teacher) This is it!

401
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,950
You, Inma, have you been fighting since your first day at school?

[Seungsik's faint smile]

403
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,320
you

404
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,060
Know that you are lucky

405
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,300
(Teacher) Nam Seung-sik, Lee Geul-jae, you two

406
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,800
Come to the teachers' office right now.

are you okay?

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,290
Yeah, it's okay

425
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,960
(together) I'm sorry

426
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
(Student 8) Hey, because of you
I almost died

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
[Light sigh]

429
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,110
(Yoongi) Idiot
What does it feel like to come from a place like juvenile detention center?

430
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,980
(Hong Il) You will feel it just by looking at it

431
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,180
(Yoongi) Uigyeom

432
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,060
A transfer student came in the third year.
I heard you got into a fight with Nam Seung-sik

433
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,760
why?

434
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,790
(Hongil) Why, why?

435
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,960
Of course I'm trying to catch up with school

436
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,530
If you lay down Nam Seung-sik

437
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,900
Next up is Kim Ui-gyeom, you right?

438
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,900
Where should I go?

439
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,570
wait for a sec

440
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,870
(Yoongi) There's no need to fight right away

441
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,010
You have to explore first

442
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,380
Let's go now

443
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,710
okay
[tensing music]

444
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,890
Are you going right now?

[Yoongi's whistle]

446
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,040
Is there a senior who transferred today?

447
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,110
(Yoongi) Ah

448
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,540
I can tell at a glance

449
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,950
Senior, I came here after hearing the rumor.

450
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,020
If you want to catch a school
Not senior Nam Seung-sik

451
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,990
I should have found Kim Ui-gyeom here

452
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,890
[Yoongi's laughter]

453
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,060

[Yi-gyeom's sigh]

455
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,710
Are you sure this isn't anonymous?

456
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,320
I think there is some misunderstanding.

457
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,550
I have no intention of fighting

458
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,760
Then as soon as you arrive
What was the fight with Nam Seung-sik about?

459
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,830
(Geoljae) I just stopped him because he was attacking me

460
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,930
[laughs]
Then let me block it too

461
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,100

465
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,080
(Yoongi) Hey, Eui-gyeom

466
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,480
Hey, stop, stop, hey
You, you're not the one to fight

467
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,420
- (Yi-gyeom) Get out of the way
- Hey, listen to me, man.

468
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,580
Hey, even if we fight, it'll be later, okay?

469
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,650
(Yoon-ki) Please, huh?

470
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,850
I told you

471
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,520
I have no intention of fighting

472
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,530
Don't touch

473
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,260
If I fight you die

474
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,700
[Yi-gyeom's heavy breathing]
(Yoongi) Oh, really, shit

475
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,270
Just stay still

476
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,430
What my senior said
I've heard it a lot since middle school

477
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,570
I apologize for what happened today

478
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,040
Uigyeom and I
I didn't mean to fight, I just

479
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,150
My senior also likes to use his fists
I thought he was a gangster

480
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
sorry

481
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,790
What you guys are doing

482
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,890
(Geoljae) Doing what gangsters do
What's different?

483
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,790
Different

484
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,860
We only pick on bad guys

485
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,500
(Yoongi) Stay still
[Geoljae's empty laughter]

486
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,400
It's fun

487
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,700
Who decides who the bad guys are?

488
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,700
Am I a bad guy or a good guy?

489
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,570
[Meaningful music]

490
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,040
you?

491
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,050
Those who use their fists
It doesn't always end well

492
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,420
You have to experience it to know

493
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,320
Experience it and feel it for yourself

494
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,000
[Yoon-ki's faint sigh]

495
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,700
(Yoongi) Wow, sir

496
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,540
I almost got sick of it, seeing this in person

497
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,710
Crazy, really

498
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:51,940
[Yoongi's laughter]

499
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,280
Is that kid that tall?

500
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,780
Kim Ui-gyeom couldn't win even if 10 people attacked him

501
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,980
Who will be Senior Geuljae in the future?
When you find out

502
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,420
At our school
There won't be a single one of you who will nag

503
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,020
The school will be quiet

504
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:03,990
[Yoongi's laughter]

505
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,520
That's why you have to have strength

506
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,890
[Yoongi's laughter]

507
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,390
[Yoongi's elasticity]

508
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,500
(Seungsik) So

509
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,030
You said you didn't fight?

510
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,270
(Hongil) Yes

511
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,170
Yeah, that transfer student

512
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,200
He said he had no intention of fighting.

513
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,240
[Seungsik's empty laughter]

514
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,840
what

515
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,440
Why are the kids suddenly like this?

516
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,380
Do you respect other people's feelings?

517
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,980
[Seungsik's empty laughter]
[Hong-il's awkward laugh]

518
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,880
(Sungwook) Seungsik

519
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,590
Are you having fun?

520
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,460
You little brat, you got stepped on by a first grader.
There was a rumor going around the school.

521
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,960
(Seungsik) Really?

522
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,800
But you got stepped on by a first-year student
Haven't you heard the rumor?

523
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,700
(Yi-gyeom) Anonymous?

524
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,900
(Yoongi) Oh, this is
It's a school that few people know about.

525
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,910
It's a kind of model school.
It's a really tough school

526
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,610
Because juvenile crime is so rampant

527
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,910
The juvenile detention center can't handle it.

528
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,320
Because all the bad guys are gathered in one place

529
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,580
You only learn worse things

530
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,520
Wouldn't that be so?

531
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,060
So, we need to rehabilitate the kids.
Is it okay to train ex-convicts?

532
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,560
Well, the Ministry of Justice is doing this

533
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,990
It's like a weird demonstration school
It's already been made

534
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,890
[Meaningful music]
There are several schools like this across the country.

535
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,330
This isn't even a juvenile detention center
It's not even school

536
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,770
Anyway, the teachers here

537
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,070
Rather, just there
Encourage a fighting atmosphere

538
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,640
[noisy fighting sounds]
They just rank the kids by fighting rank and manage them like that.

539
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,040
Do you know Samcheong Education Corps?

540
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,140
uh

541
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,680
(Yoon-ki) That, in the past
Arrest the thugs

542
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,610
I was treated like a dog

543
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,150
You can think of it as the same thing

544
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,950
But the anonymous
You have to fight every day

545
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,120
They said we have no choice but to fight

546
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,320
If you can't fight there

547
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,020
I'm completely broke
I have to live like a loner

548
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,390
But senior Geuljae
A regular high school like ours

549
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,830
That I transferred to a new school

550
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,930
[Student 9's groan]

551
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,370
There at the anonymous high school
It means that I ate a lot

552
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,100
If you eat there, it's the best
I can transfer schools

553
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,940
General high school

554
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,110
So I'm always thinking about transferring schools
They fight so hard that it makes blood boil

555
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,240
Understand?

556
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,010
[Yoongi's sigh]

557
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,350
Wow, sir, hey

558
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,510
He's senior Geuljae

559
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,980
Ha, if we had a senior like that on our side

560
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,080
There really is nothing to be afraid of in this world, really

561
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,950
to?

562
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,360
[tensing music]

563
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,290
[Seongwook and Seungsik's faint smile]

564
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,830
What is this situation, what is this?

00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,000
[exciting music]

566
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,930
(Seungsik) Hey, it's hot!

567
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,070
(Sungwook) Hey, catch that kid!

568
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,240
(Yoongi) Wow, man, daebak, man

569
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,570
Hey, let's go see it quickly.

570
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,540
Hurry up and get to work, let's go

571
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,370
Hey, let's go see it, quickly
Hurry up, hurry up, come quickly

572
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,310
[The heavy breathing of the bullies]

573

[Creating music]

[Seungsik's heavy breathing]
[The bullies' urgent voices]

575
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,500
(Iljin 4) Hey!

576
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,730
[Seungsik's heavy breathing]

577
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,670
(Seungsik) Huh?

578
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,670
[Struggling] Ah, sir

579
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,980
[interesting music]

580
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,910
what?

581
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,650
Have you been waiting?

582
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,380
(Iljin 4) Oh my

583
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,250
Do you really have to see it through to the end?

584
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,090
[Seungsik's laughter]

585
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,160
(Seungsik) Isn't it cool?

586
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,060
As expected, it's an anonymous legend

587
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,630
I didn't know you were that famous

588
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,000
how

589
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,370
Shouldn't you play a game with me?

590
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,670
[Geuljae's sigh]

591
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,770
Lastly I say

592
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,410
I'll pretend not to be at school

593
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,180
So let's stop here

594
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,080
[laugh]

595
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,250
Charisma kills

596
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,750
But it's already too late

597
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,450
Because this is my pride

I apologize again

It looked dangerous

You know too?

633
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,190
Oh, but don't look at it so negatively.

634
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,460
My senior said that

635
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,530
You have to experience it to know

636
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,860
We are experiencing this right now too.
[laugh]

637
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,270
(Yoon-ki) Oh, but senior
You are the kind of person who should not cause accidents

638
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,170
If the fight we had just now gets rumored at school

639
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,670

Senior, I'll just do it once
When you need help

643

If you could help me just once
Can't you? Yes?

00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,050
Are you threatening me now?

Senior, then tell me
You just owe me one debt, okay?

648
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,360
Just once, okay?

Am I a bad guy or a good guy?

you?

(Instructor) Okay, each one
Should I differentiate with respect to t?

659
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,920
Okay, then

You can ask first

[heavy music]
Why did you do that, what did you do?

678
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,750
I'm asking you

679
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,080
Can't we talk it out without hitting?

680
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,720
You, get out

now!

Your teaching style

686
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,570
Makes the kid more wrong
Don't you think so?

687
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,640
what?

688
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:12,080
