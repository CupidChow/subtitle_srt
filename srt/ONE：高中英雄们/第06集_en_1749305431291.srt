Don't fight

536
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,580
Yoongi, don't hang out with that kind of guy.

537
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,590
[Seungjun's empty laughter]

538
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,560
Wearing headphones like before

539
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,260
Go study, Inma
[Yi-gyeom's groan]

540
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,100
A guy who studies well and comes from a good family
What are you worried about?

541
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,300
While going to school
I've never fought before

542
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,900
There are a lot of kids graduating

543
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,340
And this fight

544
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,210
Once you've done it, keep doing it, okay?

545
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,640
[cell phone vibrating]

546
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,520
Why don't you accept it? Isn't it your home?

547
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,950
(Yi-gyeom) I don't want to accept it

548
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,420
[Seungjun's laughter]

549
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,490
[Yi-gyeom's groan]

550
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,590
(Seungjun) Beomsaengi
I had a big accident today

551
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,660
[Yi-gyeom's struggling voice]

552
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,390
There was a time when I first started boxing.

553
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,100
What, you hit someone in the face and get hit in the face

554
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,330
[Seungjun's powerful breathing]

555
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,600
That's so scary

556
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,470
The fight is the same

557
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,710
It's difficult at first

558
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,640
Hitting and getting hit in the face

559
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,950
And then you lose your fear?

560
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,720
From then on the fight
It becomes very natural

561
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,990
It becomes a habit, a habit

562
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,660
For some reason
It's not a fight

563
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,890
Make up a reason

564
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,390
Because it's a habit

565
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,730
[laugh]

566
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,600
(Yi-gyeom) Hey, Seung-jun Kim
You speak well.

567
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,040
It's unexpected

568
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,110
[Yi-gyeom's laughter]

569
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,210
What have you been up to?

570
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,710
I'm just being childish
Well, I was just holding onto Fukashi

571
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,190
You should just learn boxing instead.

572
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,090
[cell phone vibrating]
(Seungjun) Ah, don't do things like fighting, do boxing, Inma.

573
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,560
[sigh]

574
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,870
Hey, take that
Your parents will be worried

575
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,040
[sigh]

576
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,940
[heavy music]

577
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,520
[Seungjun's tongue clicking sound]

578
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,890
[Yi-gyeom's sigh]

579
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,400
(Yi-gyeom) I'm going to sleep over at my friend's house.

580
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,410
- Hey, teacher.
- (private tutor) Yes

581
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,050
Today my child
I think I'll be late

582
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,820
- sorry
- (private tutor) Ah

583
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,420
Hey, it's okay

584
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,850
Then I'll come back tomorrow

585
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,100
(Dabin) I'm sorry, my child
This kid has never been like this before

586
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,200
(Tutor) Oh, yes.

587
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,700
Oh, don't come out

588
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,300
Yes, see you tomorrow.

589
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,200
- (Dabin) Take care.
- (private tutor) Yes

590
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,700
[Sound of door opening]
[Door lock operation sound]

591
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,180
[Door lock operation sound]

592
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,150
[Seok-tae's sigh]

593
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,990
[rider's laughter]

594
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,940
Kangyoon?

595
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,540
Is this the Kang-Yoon we know?

596
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,440
(Doyle) That's right

597
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,680
Then who is the kid next to you?

598
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,910
(Rider) Oh, this kid is funny.

599
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,310
(Doyle in the video) Hey
Who are you?

600
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,150
[heavy breathing]

601
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,680
High school superhero
This kid

602
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,120
[rider's laughter]

603
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,450
'High School Superhero'?

604
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,690
[rider's laughter]

605
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,320
He's a kid I don't even know

606
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,190
(Doyle) He's a guy that Namhyeop knows.

607
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,000
(Namhyeop) I don't know much about it

608
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,370
I saw him briefly at my father's alumni association.

609
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,870
He's a guy who has nothing to do with us

610
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,440
Hey, anyway

611
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,810
You're saying you got hit by him too?

612
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,740
Lee Ki-yoon

613
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,350
[rider's laughter]

614
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,350
(Rider) Oh my god, you guys, really

615
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,150
Oh, hello, my middle school kids

616
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,620
(Rider Friend 1) Hello

617
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,050
[Rider's Sigh]

618
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,290
(Rider Friend 2) Oh, but

619
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,460
Where are you going like a fool?
I came here after getting hit

620
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,000
Are you here to meet Gisu now?

621
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,060
[Laughter from the riders]

622
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,930
- I see
- (Rider Friend 1) Bbaengsin [dark music]

623
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,570
[Coughs from the riders]

624
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
(Rider) But what can I do?

625
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,170
Even though we're like idiots, we're still friends

626
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,940
[The rider's empty laughter]

627
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,080
So what do you want me to do?

628
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,680
Arms? Legs?

629
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,420
where?

630
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,920
[Cue rubbing sound]

631
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,050
Do it yourself

632
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,190
But Hyeop-ah

633
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,490
You are a commoner at Seomungo
What are you doing here?

634
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,860
(Rider) Dad told you to study

635
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,230
Didn't you send it to Seomungo?

636
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,940
Follow your father
I need to become a doctor quickly.

637
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,310
Then I can help you later

638
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,140
Lee Ji-seong woke up yesterday

639
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,880
who?

640
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:42,980
(Rider) Ah

641
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,020
That little bastard that fell off on his own?

642
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,190
[heavy music]

643
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,560
so?

644
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,230
What is that?

645
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,860
Because of that kid's grades
Didn't you fall alone?

646
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,860
uh?

647
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,830
Your dad
You know best, kid.

648
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,070
[Namhyeop's absurd breathing]

649
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,810
Hey, but seriously, your dad too
Great, great

650
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,540
[snickers] That's it
Two years ago? Three years?

651
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,610
Are you still looking into it?

652
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,350
[Laughing] Hey, sir.
It's annoying, it's annoying, huh?

653
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,020
scary

654
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,890
Hey, that's about it
I'm a doctor

655
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,090
[Laughter from the riders]

656
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,120
[rider's laughter]

657
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,460
So, did you find out about school?

658
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,060
Even in middle school
I asked the kids below

659
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,070
I heard you're in love

660
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:36,830
ductility?

661
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,470
This kid ran away to the next neighborhood?

662
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:42,740
I'll go tomorrow

663
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,280
Can I just do it myself?

664
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,580
But Hyeop-ah

665
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,390
Give me more money this time

666
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,230
Oh, we're friends

667
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,460
You only come to me at times like this

668
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,800
(Rider) I'm very sad

669
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,010
Give me more pocket money this time

670
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:16,810
uh?

671
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,380
[Laughter from the riders]

672
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,350
(Seungjun) Everyday
What do you see here?

673
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,620
Like a fool

674
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,160
Can't you see?

675
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,790
- what?
- (Yi-gyeom) Airplane

676
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,900
(Seungjun) Oh, I see that
That's what I said

677
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,830
[airplane engine sound]
[Calm music]

678
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,900
But can you hear everything even after writing that?

679
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,400
this?

680
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,740
It's broken, it doesn't make a sound

681
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,910
[laughs]

682
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,980
Now, this civil revolution

683
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,950
(Teacher) Citizens' freedom and
suppressing rights

684
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,490
Cut off the king's head

685
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,290
This is a civil revolution

686
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:09,190
After the introduction of the civil revolution
Civil society comes in

687
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,600
The image of citizens becoming the masters

688
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,230
The most representative example is
What could there be?

689
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,570
(Students) Democracy and republic.

690
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,430
(Teacher) Right

691
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,240
And then there is the constitutional monarchy.

692
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,740
[tensing music]

693
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,210
[Deep breath]

694
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,690
(Rider) You really don't know?

695
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,100
[Student 5's trembling breathing]
I don't know

696
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,830
(Rider) Hey, just
Answer if you know, okay?

697
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,070
[Yawning sound of Iljin 20]

698
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,100
Oh, you guys?

699
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:57,980
What are you?

700
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Aren't you Kang-yoon?

701
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,980
(Rider) Oh, this kid
You keep saying you don't know

702
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,230
what?

703
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,630
No, you're not Kang Yoon-gi

704
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,530
Bring Kang Yoon-ki here.

705
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,330
[laughs]

706
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
Me for free?

707
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,940
Hey, how much is it?

708
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,570
(Seungsik) Hmm

709
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,710
[laugh]

710
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,410
50 thousand won

711
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,910
okay

712
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,980
Let's get 50 thousand won worth once

713
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,350
[Seungsik's groan]
