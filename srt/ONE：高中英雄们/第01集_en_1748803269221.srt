1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key...

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
...on the door.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key...

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
...on the door.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,200
produced by E einer

12
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,820
You were not struggling to sustain the economy.

13
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,840
The Thanh Thai is always other members of the Single Saiyan

14
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,760
You did praise a lot Miss Ji

15
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,880
You are prevail可是 conflicts with the government

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,680
Especially your foreign-owned competitions

17
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,900
Also, you won the award for a special mahjong

18
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,280
Miss Ji requested a special dialyce

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,280
And we also love when a good student like you comes in.

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,280
This place is different from the Seomun High School.

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,280
There are more students, so the atmosphere is different.

22
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
Do you know what I mean?

23
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,280
I'll get used to it.

24
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Everyone is a good student.

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Right?

26
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Yes.

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Everyone, sit down.

28
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Hello.

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Today, our classmate is here.

30
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Kang Hyunki, you're early today.

31
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,280
That's right. I'm not in the subway today.

32
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,280
What's wrong? You're not in the subway?

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,280
I'm going early.

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Okay.

35
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,280
Kim Woo-kyum, do you want to introduce yourself?

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,280
I'm Kim Woo-kyum.

37
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Is it over?

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
It's short, so it's good.

39
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,280
I'm sitting down.

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,280
This is a plan for the class.

41
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Write it down and submit it tomorrow.

42
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Kim Woo-kyum said that he won the first place in the school.

43
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Be a good student.

44
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
Help your school life.

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,280
Yes.

46
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,280
Don't get sick or get sick.

47
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Choi Hong-il.

48
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
Yes.

49
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Okay?

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
Yes.

51
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,280
Why did you come to the first place?

52
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,280
I'll come.

53
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,280
Don't get sleepy during class.

54
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,280
Don't do anything else.

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Okay.

56
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Yes.

57
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Let go of me.

58
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
I'm going to sleep.

59
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
You're going to sleep as soon as you see this bastard.

60
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
Let go of me.

61
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Don't touch me when you're in school.

62
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
I'm going to sleep.

63
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,280
Let's look at page 3.

64
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
What's the result of all the mistakes?

65
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,280
I'm a little late today, so I'm sending you the pictures I took in the academy.

66
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
I'm studying.

67
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Go home soon.

68
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm going to sleep.

69
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
Good morning.

70
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
Oh, are you here?

71
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
How was the new school?

72
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
It was okay.

73
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,280
This school uniform is prettier.

74
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Do you need anything?

75
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Mom.

76
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Yes.

77
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Can't you try the medicine that your mom is taking?

78
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Why?

79
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,280
Why do you need medicine for a student?

80
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
No.

81
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I'm going to sleep.

82
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Where are you?

83
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,280
How many pages are there?

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
178 pages.

85
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
I drank a little with dad.

86
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,280
The doctors are all bad guys.

87
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,280
I'm going to get a doctor's license.

88
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,280
The doctors think that their children are the best.

89
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
I'm going to sleep.

90
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Kim Hyuk-yong.

91
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Do you want to focus?

92
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Focus.

93
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
I'm sorry.

94
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
It's not something I'm sorry about.

95
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Again.

96
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Again.

97
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
Again.

98
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Again.

99
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
That's right.

100
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
You can do it.

101
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Why do you keep falling into the same trap?

102
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Focus.

103
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Next.

104
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,280
Mom.

105
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
What's wrong?

106
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,280
You're crazy.

107
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Did I tell you to go to the desk?

108
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Come here.

109
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,280
You're not getting hit these days, are you?

110
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,280
I can't focus because I'm not getting hit.

111
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
Get up, you bastard.

112
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
I bought you a bread.

113
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
I'm starving.

114
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Did you eat?

115
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Yes, I did.

116
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
I'm sorry.

117
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Mom, make it delicious.

118
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
It's going to be good.

119
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
I'm starving.

120
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
Hey.

121
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Hey.

122
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
Hey.

123
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
How much is it?

124
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
2,000 won.

125
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
2,000 won?

126
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
Do you want to make it 2,000 won?

127
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,280
I'm hungry today, so I can't eat all day.

128
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Can you do it?

129
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Did you give it to me at school?

130
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Why?

131
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
You didn't use your hope yet.

132
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,280
What are you doing?

133
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
I should start over.

134
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Stand up, you bastard.

135
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Hey, you bastard.

136
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Hey, you bastard.

137
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
What are you doing?

138
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Hey, you bastard.

139
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
1,000 won.

140
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
You're going to get hit.

141
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
You're not going to get hit.

142
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Hey, you bastard.

143
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Why are you so stupid?

144
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Hey, you ate your lunch.

145
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Why are you so stupid?

146
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Stand up.

147
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
What did you do yesterday?

148
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Did you see my money yesterday?

149
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
No, I didn't.

150
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
No, bastard.

151
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Why are you so stupid?

152
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
You bastard.

153
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,280
You said you didn't eat your lunch.

154
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,280
No?

155
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
You bastard.

156
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
You bastard.

157
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
What did you do to me?

158
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Hey, you bastard.

159
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
You bastard.

160
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
You bastard.

161
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
You bastard.

162
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,280
You bastard.

163
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,280
What are you doing here?

164
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,280
Stop it.

165
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,280
You bastard.

166
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
You bastard.

167
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Get up, you bastard.

168
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Stop it, you bastard.

169
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Okay, I won't hit you.

170
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,280
I won't hit you.

171
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
You got hit, bastard.

172
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Get out of here.

173
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Are you not going to wake up today?

174
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Do you want to do more?

175
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
What are you doing, you bastards?

176
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Get out of here.

177
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
You bastard.

178
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
I'm just a man.

179
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
What's this?

180
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Are you crazy?

181
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,280
You bastard.

182
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,280
You bastard.

183
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,280
You bastard.

184
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Get out of here, you bastard.

185
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,280
I'm sorry.

186
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Actually...

187
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Yeah, yeah.

188
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,280
I was out of my mind.

189
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
I'll fix it slowly.

190
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,280
I'll make some money.

191
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Money?

192
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
You're a bastard.

193
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
You're in a bad mood.

194
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
Because of you.

195
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
You're right.

196
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Was that a gold coin?

197
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Was it?

198
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Do 10,000 won.

199
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Why do you give 10,000 won?

200
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Take your phone out.

201
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Why?

202
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
You're a bastard.

203
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
You're trying to take my phone number.

204
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
You should have taken my phone number.

205
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
No, that's not true.

206
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
You mean it?

207
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Yeah.

208
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Hong-il,

209
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
if I talk, you'll check it in 10 seconds and answer.

210
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Yeah.

211
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,280
When I was in school and when I was studying at home,

212
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
I already...

213
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
If you don't answer in 10 seconds,

214
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
it's a one-second time.

215
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
Go.

216
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Do you want to go to the karaoke?

217
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
I don't think you're scared of the devil.

218
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
You're really scary.

219
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Didn't you see the bubbles?

220
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
You didn't see it.

221
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
I didn't see it.

222
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
I'm sorry.

224
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
I called from the academy.

225
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
If you don't get a good result in this exam,

226
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
you have to go to the Chinese class.

227
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
I told you that I would never do that.

228
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
Go to my place and buy bread.

229
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
I'm sorry.

230
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Why do you need my phone?

231
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Hey you bastard,

232
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
are you laughing at me?

233
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
I gave you bread.

234
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Do you want to die?

235
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
Sorry.

236
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,280
I forgot.

237
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
I'll forget it.

238
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Did you have breakfast?

239
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Yes.

240
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,140
Did you make mom eat it for you?

241
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
Yes.

242
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,640
But this bastard is talking about music,

243
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,560
and he's holding a phone.

244
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,120
What? Why isn't it coming out?

245
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,420
Didn't you say it was a bug?

246
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,020
How did you turn it on?

247
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Give it to me.

248
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
What?

249
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
A replay?

250
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,560
It's not coming out.

251
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
What?

252
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Huh?

253
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Oh, I like it.

254
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Hey, Chae Hong-il.

255
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
What is this?

256
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Give it to me.

257
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
What?

258
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
I want to hear it.

259
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
Are you crazy?

260
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
It's an important class for me.

261
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
I'm not a student.

262
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Give it to me.

263
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
I don't want to.

264
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
It's mine from now on.

265
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Hey.

266
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
I'll ask you.

267
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Give it to me.

268
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
I'm so scared.

269
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,560
If it's that important, I'll tell you seriously.

270
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
It's a human-like bastard.

271
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
I'm scared.

272
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Take it.

273
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Hey.

274
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
I told you it's important.

275
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
So?

276
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
What do you want?

277
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
What do you want?

278
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Huh?

279
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
What do you want?

280
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
Hey.

281
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Don't you want to call the police?

282
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Do you want to get a call?

283
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
You just want to be a pig today, right?

284
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Huh?

285
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
You bastard.

286
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Hey.

287
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
Are you okay?

288
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
I don't have any problems.

289
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Hey.

290
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Give me the car.

291
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
I'm really going to kill you today.

292
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
I'm going to kill you today.

293
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
Okay.

294
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
I'll kill you.

295
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Stop.

296
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Stop.

297
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Hey.

298
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Hey.

299
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Stop.

300
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
What?

301
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
What?

302
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
What do you want?

303
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
What do you want?

304
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
What do you want?

305
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
What do you want?

306
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Damn it.

307
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
Damn it.

308
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Damn it.

309
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
You crazy bastard.

310
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
It's 1 to 1.

311
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
You can't get him, right?

312
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
What the hell are you doing?

313
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Me?

314
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
The judge.

315
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
What the hell are you doing?

316
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
I told you I was important.

317
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Why did you take him to the police station?

318
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Come here, you bastard.

319
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Can you be my wife?

320
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Hey.

321
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Nice soup.

322
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
I'm sorry.

323
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
Hey, Kim Yu-kyung.

324
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
Hey, Kim Yu-kyung.

325
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
Hey, Kang Yu-kyung.

326
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
You're the same age as me.

327
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
You were good at fighting.

328
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
What kind of exercise did you learn?

329
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
I didn't learn.

330
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
Okay.

331
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Fight is talent.

332
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
So how are you going to fight tomorrow?

333
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
What are you saying?

334
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
How are you going to fight tomorrow?

335
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,560
I'm not going to fight.

336
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
You have to fight.

337
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
You're the best.

338
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
You're not going to stay still.

339
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
I don't want to fight.

340
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
You're not going to stay still.

341
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
I don't want to fight.

342
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
You're not going to stay still.

343
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Hey, leave it.

344
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
It's starting tomorrow.

345
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Goodbye, Kim Yu-kyung.

346
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
I'm sorry.

347
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Oh, my.

348
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
You're so slow.

349
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
You started the test.

350
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
I'm sorry.

351
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
I'll check it out.

352
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
Okay.

353
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Take care.

354
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Thank you.

355
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
Why are you here?

356
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
I'm back.

357
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Go wash up.

358
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
Kim Yu-kyung.

359
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Why did you get up late today?

360
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
I thought I forgot to give you a ride.

361
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,560
I'm sorry.

362
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
I'm sorry.

363
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
I'm sorry.

364
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
I'm sorry.

365
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
I'm sorry.

366
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
I'm sorry.

367
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,560
I know that if you don't get a good result this time,

368
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,560
you'll be in the middle of the game.

369
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Okay.

370
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
I'm not talking.

371
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
I'm sorry.

372
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Study hard.

373
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Just look for this and go back.

374
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Okay.

375
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Hey.

376
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Listen to this.

377
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
How is it?

378
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
It's good, right?

379
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
This is real.

380
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,560
It's real music.

381
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
You...

382
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
Yu-kyung.

383
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Don't listen to it with your ears.

384
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Feel it with your heart.

385
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
I'm sorry.

386
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
This is not music.

387
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
It's real.

388
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Real life.

389
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Yu-kyung.

390
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,560
Why are you standing like this?

391
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
How old are you?

392
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,560
193.

393
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
I'm 193.

394
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
I'm 193.

395
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
I'm 193.

396
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm 193.

397
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
I'm 193.

398
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
I'm 193.

399
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
I'm 193.

400
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
I'm 193.

401
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
I'm 193.

402
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Is this for me?

403
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Did you sleep well last night?

404
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,560
I couldn't even sleep because of you.

405
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
I'm sorry about yesterday.

406
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
What?

407
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,560
You're such a fool.

408
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Sorry?

409
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
Yes.

410
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
I'm really sorry.

411
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,560
You're such a fool.

412
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Let's meet later.

413
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,560
What's wrong with him?

414
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
He's so cute.

415
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
He's so cute.

416
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,560
I can't think of anything to think about.

417
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Did I tell you?

418
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
It's starting from today.

419
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
I think it's Kim Soon-jun.

420
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,560
He's a great guy who works hard for boxing.

421
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
He's not that great.

422
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
The fight is starting.

423
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
If you stand on the punch line, you'll be crushed.

424
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
You'll be stuck.

425
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,560
And you'll be cramped.

426
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,560
You're stronger.

427
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,560
I think so.

428
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Don't fight with me.

429
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,560
And...

430
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
I'm not going to fight.

431
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
You're not going to fight?

432
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,560
You're such a fool.

433
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
You're not going to fight?

434
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,560
You're such a fool.

435
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Get out.

436
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
Get out.

437
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
Get out of here.

438
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,560
Get up.

439
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,560
Hurry up.

440
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Hurry up.

441
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
What's wrong?

442
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
Are you not going to fight?

443
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,560
Me?

444
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Guk-young.

445
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,560
Are you going to die?

446
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
It was so much fun yesterday.

447
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
Are you okay?

448
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
I was just going in the right way.

449
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
I just got stuck.

450
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,560
You're a crazy guy.

451
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
I'll call you.

452
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,560
You're a crazy guy.

453
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,560
You're not going to fight with those crazy guys.

454
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
You're a crazy guy.

455
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
You're a bad guy.

456
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
You're a bad guy.

457
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
Are you going to die?

458
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
Oh, hi.

459
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
Hey.

460
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
What's wrong with you?

461
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
Did you tell Hong-il?

462
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
I apologized for what happened yesterday.

463
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
And your friend...

464
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
What?

465
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Are you kidding me?

466
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
Guk-young.

467
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Why me?

468
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Guk-young.

469
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,560
It's the last time.

470
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Guk-young.

471
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,560
I'm going to kill you.

472
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
What's wrong?

473
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
What's wrong?

474
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
What's wrong?

475
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Guk-young?

476
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Are you bleeding?

477
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Hey, Seung-joon.

478
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Did you hit him?

479
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
You're so curious.

480
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,560
What are you going to fight with, you bastard?

481
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
You bastard.

482
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
I'm going to go.

483
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Okay.

484
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Hang in there.

485
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,560
Take Guk-young to the nursing room.

486
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
Okay.

487
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
I'll talk to you in the office.

488
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Hey, Seung-joon.

489
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
Are you a gangster?

490
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Are you a gangster?

491
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,560
If you do anything because you're working out,

492
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
you're a gangster.

493
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
What do I do with you?

494
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,560
What if I hit you with a fake phone?

495
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,560
You bastard.

496
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,560
You can't even contact your mother.

497
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
Do you know where she is?

498
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,560
What does that have to do with you?

499
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
What does it have to do with you?

500
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
You bastard.

501
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
You bastard who worked out.

502
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
You bastard.

503
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,560
You're not the first one, are you?

504
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,560
You said you were going to punch me, right?

505
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,560
I told you to punch me.

506
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,560
I told you, you can't punch me like this.

507
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
You have to stick it on.

508
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
You have to hold it.

509
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
You said you were going to punch me.

510
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,560
You're so mean.

511
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,560
You're a bastard who works out a lot when you get my coaching.

512
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,560
I don't fight.

513
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
I don't think he's a bastard.

514
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
Please.

515
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,560
Can you stop talking to me?

516
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,560
I'm sorry.

517
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,560
Hello?

518
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,560
What is it?

519
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,560
You're out of your cassette?

520
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
Did you take it?

521
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,560
You're out of your cassette after you got the other one.

522
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,560
Choi Young-il, where are you?

523
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,560
You bastard.

524
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,560
You're the first one in the gold market.

525
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,560
You're a bastard who works out a lot.

526
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,560
Where are you?

527
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,560
You're the one who's going to punch me.

528
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,560
I'm sorry.

529
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,560
Kim Mook-hyun!

530
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Hey, Kim Mook-hyun!

531
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,560
What are you doing?

532
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
Don't run.

533
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
You're going to get hurt if you lose your strength.

534
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,560
If you touch this, you're going to turn around, right?

535
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,560
You're going to get completely blinded.

536
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,560
You're a crazy bastard.

537
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,560
You're going to get hit on the head and bite your neck.

538
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,560
You might bite your teeth.

539
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Be careful.

540
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
I'm on my way home.

541
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,560
I'm on my way home.

542
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,560
I think I'm on my way home.

543
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,560
But I guess the cassette is important.

544
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
It's yours.

545
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,560
Yours?

546
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
I borrowed it, so be careful.

547
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,560
Oh, it's yours.

548
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,560
I guess the guys here are not kidding.

549
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,560
They've been hitting you since you took off your shoes.

550
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,560
They're here to get you.

551
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,560
I guess...

552
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,560
You're here.

553
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,560
Kang Yong-gi!

554
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,560
Hi.

555
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,560
Wait here.

556
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,560
If Kim Minkyeom is done, I'll have to make him pay for his personal training.

557
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,560
I'm sorry.

558
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,560
I'll be back.

559
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,560
You're a crazy bastard.

560
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,560
Take this.

561
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,560
Go and bring it.

562
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,560
Before you talk to Park.

563
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,560
Keep going.

564
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Keep it.

565
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,560
Don't kill me.

566
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,560
Give me my Walkman.

567
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,560
Who's not giving it to me?

568
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,560
I'll give it to you.

569
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,560
If you win with me, it's easy, right?

570
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,560
Why should I fight?

571
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,560
Take off your bag.

572
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,560
I said I didn't want to fight.

573
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,560
I feel very dirty today.

574
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,560
Stop it.

575
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,560
You're a total bastard.

576
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,560
Stop it.

577
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,560
Stop it!

578
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,560
You're a total bastard.

579
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,560
Stop it.

580
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,560
Are you having fun because you're a human?

581
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,560
Do you have something to say now?

582
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,560
Hey, Kim Seung-jun.

583
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,560
You guys are the ones who started the fight first.

584
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,560
And you guys are the ones who took my Walkman.

585
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,560
Damn it!

586
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,560
What did I do wrong?

587
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,560
Did you do something wrong?

588
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,560
You should've brought it to me.

589
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,560
We're just a bunch of fools.

590
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,560
Are you guys going to fight?

591
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,560
Give me your hand.

592
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,560
I'm sorry.

593
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,560
You're a big-hearted person.

594
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,560
Let's try.

595
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,560
What should I do?

596
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,560
Try again.

597
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,560
Should I give you a try?

598
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,560
Faster.

599
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,560
Stop it.

600
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,560
What's wrong with you?

601
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,560
You're a total bastard.

602
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,560
What's wrong with you?

603
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,560
Stop it.

604
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,560
It's time.

605
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,560
Then I'm lying.

606
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,560
It's over.

607
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,560
I'm sorry.

608
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,560
I'm sorry.

609
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,560
I'm sorry.

610
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,560
I'm sorry.

611
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,560
I'm sorry.

612
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,560
I'm sorry.

613
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,560
I'm sorry.

614
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,560
I'm sorry.

615
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,560
I'm sorry.

616
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,560
I'm sorry.

617
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,560
I'm sorry.

618
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,560
I'm sorry.

619
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,560
I'm sorry.

620
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,560
I'm sorry.

621
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,560
I'm sorry.

622
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,560
I'm sorry.

623
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,560
I'm sorry.

624
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,560
I'm sorry.

625
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,560
I'm sorry.

626
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,560
I'm sorry.

627
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,560
I'm sorry.

628
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,560
I'm sorry.

629
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,560
I'm sorry.

630
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,560
I'm sorry.

631
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,560
I'm sorry.

632
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,560
I'm sorry.

633
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,560
I'm sorry.
