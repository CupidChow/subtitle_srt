Are you acting weird right now?

536
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,381
Don't fight

537
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:42,583
Yoongi, don't hang out with that kind of guy.

538
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:47,588
[Seungjun's empty laughter]

539
00:29:48,189 --> 00:29:49,557
Wearing headphones like before

540
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:51,258
Go study, Inma
[Yi-gyeom's groan]

541
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:55,095
A guy who studies well and comes from a good family
What are you worried about?

542
00:29:56,197 --> 00:29:58,299
While going to school
I've never fought before

543
00:29:58,299 --> 00:29:59,900
There are a lot of kids graduating

544
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:03,337
And this fight

545
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:06,207
Once you've done it, keep doing it, okay?

546
00:30:07,475 --> 00:30:08,642
[cell phone vibrating]

547
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:16,517
Why don't you accept it? Isn't it your home?

548
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:17,952
(Yi-gyeom) I don't want to accept it

549
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,420
[Seungjun's laughter]

550
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:20,488
[Yi-gyeom's groan]

551
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:22,590
(Seungjun) Beomsaengi
I had a big accident today

552
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,657
[Yi-gyeom's struggling voice]

553
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,393
There was a time when I first started boxing.

554
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:30,097
What, you hit someone in the face and get hit in the face

555
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:31,332
[Seungjun's powerful breathing]

556
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:32,600
That's so scary

557
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:36,470
The fight is the same

558
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:39,707
It's difficult at first

559
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:42,643
Hitting and getting hit in the face

560
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:44,945
And then you lose your fear?

561
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,716
From then on the fight
It becomes very natural

562
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:51,986
It becomes a habit, a habit

563
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:56,657
For some reason
It's not a fight

564
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,893
Make up a reason

565
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,394
Because it's a habit

566
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:02,730
[laugh]

567
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,601
(Yi-gyeom) Hey, Seung-jun Kim
You speak well.

568
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:09,036
It's unexpected

569
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,105
[Yi-gyeom's laughter]

570
00:31:12,173 --> 00:31:13,207
What have you been up to?

571
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:16,710
I'm just being childish
Well, I was just holding onto Fukashi

572
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:26,187
You should just learn boxing instead.

573
00:31:27,021 --> 00:31:30,090
[cell phone vibrating]
(Seungjun) Ah, don't do things like fighting, do boxing, Inma.

574
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:32,560
[sigh]

575
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:42,870
Hey, take that
Your parents will be worried

576
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,041
[sigh]

577
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:49,944
[heavy music]

578
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:54,515
[Seungjun's tongue clicking sound]

579
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:03,891
[Yi-gyeom's sigh]

580
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:11,398
(Yi-gyeom) I'm going to sleep over at my friend's house.

581
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,408
- Hey, teacher.
- (private tutor) Yes

582
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:26,046
Today my child
I think I'll be late

583
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:27,815
- sorry
- (private tutor) Ah

584
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:29,416
Hey, it's okay

585
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,853
Then I'll come back tomorrow

586
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:41,095
(Dabin) I'm sorry, my child
This kid has never been like this before

587
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,196
(Tutor) Oh, yes.

588
00:32:43,164 --> 00:32:44,698
Oh, don't come out

589
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:46,300
Yes, see you tomorrow.

590
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:49,203
- (Dabin) Take care.
- (private tutor) Yes

591
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:50,704
[Sound of door opening]
[Door lock operation sound]

592
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:56,177
[Door lock operation sound]

593
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:03,150
[Seok-tae's sigh]

594
00:33:12,393 --> 00:33:13,994
[rider's laughter]

595
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:20,935
Kangyoon?

596
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:24,538
Is this the Kang-Yoon we know?

597
00:33:25,473 --> 00:33:26,440
(Doyle) That's right

598
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:29,677
Then who is the kid next to you?

599
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:30,911
(Rider) Oh, this kid is funny.

600
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:32,313
(Doyle in the video) Hey
Who are you?

601
00:33:32,313 --> 00:33:33,147
[heavy breathing]

602
00:33:33,147 --> 00:33:35,683
High school superhero
This kid

603
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:37,117
[rider's laughter]

604
00:33:37,117 --> 00:33:38,452
'High School Superhero'?

605
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:39,687
[rider's laughter]

606
00:33:39,854 --> 00:33:41,322
He's a kid I don't even know

607
00:33:42,923 --> 00:33:44,191
(Doyle) He's a guy that Namhyeop knows.

608
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:48,996
(Namhyeop) I don't know much about it

609
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:51,365
I saw him briefly at my father's alumni association.

610
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:53,868
He's a guy who has nothing to do with us

611
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:55,436
Hey, anyway

612
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:57,805
You're saying you got hit by him too?

613
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:01,742
Lee Ki-yoon

614
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,345
[rider's laughter]

615
00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:07,348
(Rider) Oh my god, you guys, really

616
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:11,152
Oh, hello, my middle school kids

617
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:12,620
(Rider Friend 1) Hello

618
00:34:13,187 --> 00:34:14,054
[Rider's Sigh]

619
00:34:14,088 --> 00:34:15,289
(Rider Friend 2) Oh, but

620
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:18,459
Where are you going like a fool?
I came here after getting hit

621
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:20,995
Are you here to meet Gisu now?

622
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:22,062
[Laughter from the riders]

623
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:23,931
- I see
- (Rider Friend 1) Bbaengsin [dark music]

624
00:34:27,868 --> 00:34:29,570
[Coughs from the riders]

625
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:31,238
(Rider) But what can I do?

626
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:33,174
Even though we're like idiots, we're still friends

627
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:34,942
[The rider's empty laughter]

628
00:34:37,044 --> 00:34:38,078
So what do you want me to do?

629
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:40,681
Arms? Legs?

630
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:42,416
where?

631
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,918
[Cue rubbing sound]

632
00:34:44,218 --> 00:34:45,052
Do it yourself

633
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:47,188
But Hyeop-ah

634
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:50,491
You are a commoner at Seomungo
What are you doing here?

635
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:52,860
(Rider) Dad told you to study

636
00:34:53,894 --> 00:34:55,229
Didn't you send it to Seomungo?

637
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,936
Follow your father
I need to become a doctor quickly.

638
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,305
Then I can help you later

639
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:08,142
Lee Ji-seong woke up yesterday

640
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:09,877
who?

641
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:12,980
(Rider) Ah

642
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:17,017
That little bastard that fell off on his own?

643
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,187
[heavy music]

644
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:21,555
so?

645
00:35:23,324 --> 00:35:24,225
What is that?

646
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,862
Because of that kid's grades
Didn't you fall alone?

647
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:29,864
uh?

648
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:32,833
Your dad
You know best, kid.

649
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:34,068
[Namhyeop's absurd breathing]

650
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:39,807
Hey, but seriously, your dad too
Great, great

651
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:42,543
[snickers] That's it
Two years ago? Three years?

652
00:35:43,144 --> 00:35:44,612
Are you still looking into it?

653
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:47,348
[Laughing] Hey, sir.
It's annoying, it's annoying, huh?

654
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:49,016
scary

655
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:50,885
Hey, that's about it
I'm a doctor

656
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:52,086
[Laughter from the riders]

657
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:54,121
[rider's laughter]

658
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:59,460
So, did you find out about school?

659
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:03,063
Even in middle school
I asked the kids below

660
00:36:03,898 --> 00:36:05,065
I heard you're in love

661
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:06,834
ductility?

662
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:10,471
This kid ran away to the next neighborhood?

663
00:36:11,906 --> 00:36:12,740
I'll go tomorrow

664
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:16,277
Can I just do it myself?

665
00:36:20,614 --> 00:36:21,582
But Hyeop-ah

666
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:32,393
Give me more money this time

667
00:36:33,994 --> 00:36:35,229
Oh, we're friends

668
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:37,464
You only come to me at times like this

669
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,800
(Rider) I'm very sad

670
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:45,005
Give me more pocket money this time

671
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:46,807
uh?

672
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,376
[Laughter from the riders]

673
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,352
(Seungjun) Everyday
What do you see here?

674
00:36:58,686 --> 00:36:59,620
Like a fool

675
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:01,155
Can't you see?

676
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:03,791
- what?
- (Yi-gyeom) Airplane

677
00:37:06,494 --> 00:37:08,896
(Seungjun) Oh, I see that
That's what I said

678
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:10,831
[airplane engine sound]
[Calm music]

679
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:15,903
But can you hear everything even after writing that?

680
00:37:16,504 --> 00:37:17,404
this?

681
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:19,740
It's broken, it doesn't make a sound

682
00:37:22,943 --> 00:37:23,911
[laughs]

683
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:27,982
Now, this civil revolution

684
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:30,951
(Teacher) Citizens' freedom and
suppressing rights

685
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:32,486
Cut off the king's head

686
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,288
This is a civil revolution

687
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:39,193
After the introduction of the civil revolution
Civil society comes in

688
00:37:40,995 --> 00:37:42,596
The image of citizens becoming the masters

689
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:44,231
The most representative example is
What could there be?

690
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:46,567
(Students) Democracy and republic.

691
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,434
(Teacher) Right

692
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:50,237
And then there is the constitutional monarchy.

693
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,744
[tensing music]

694
00:37:57,545 --> 00:38:00,214
[Deep breath]

695
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:13,694
(Rider) You really don't know?

696
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,095
[Student 5's trembling breathing]
I don't know

697
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:17,832
(Rider) Hey, just
Answer if you know, okay?

698
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:23,070
[Yawning sound of Iljin 20]

699
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,104
Oh, you guys?

700
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:27,975
What are you?

701
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:32,480
Aren't you Kang-yoon?

702
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:36,984
(Rider) Oh, this kid
You keep saying you don't know

703
00:38:45,292 --> 00:38:46,227
what?

704
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:48,629
No, you're not Kang Yoon-gi

705
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:50,531
Bring Kang Yoon-ki here.

706
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:52,333
[laughs]

707
00:38:54,235 --> 00:38:55,236
Me for free?

708
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,938
Hey, how much is it?

709
00:38:58,739 --> 00:38:59,573
(Seungsik) Hmm

710
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:01,709
[laugh]

711
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:04,411
50 thousand won

712
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:05,913
okay

713
00:39:06,714 --> 00:39:07,982
