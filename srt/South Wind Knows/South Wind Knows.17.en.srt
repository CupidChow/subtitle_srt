[Episode 17]

21
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,540
Does it hurt?

22
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,660
A little.

23
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,780
Try to endure it for a bit.

24
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,140
This means the nerves
are slowly recovering,

25
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,100
which is a good thing.

26
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,500
Our Dr. Zhu sure is working very hard.

27
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,540
First, you have to take care
of the patients at the hospital.

28
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,900
Then, you have to come home
and take care of another patient like me.

29
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,580
Nonsense.

30
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,260

Thanks for your trust, Mr. He.

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,140
Mr. Fu, you're too kind.

37
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,060
So now can you join me
for a drink tonight?

38
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,340
Of course.

39
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,340
We'll drink to our heart's content.

00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
What happened?

41
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,300
Why did you drink so much?

Wake up.

50
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,620

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,780
It's okay.

52
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,580
It's fine.

53
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,660
Why are you crying again?

54

I'm just too happy.

55
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,620
Your grandpa will be happy
to hear about this too.

56
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,900
Then I'll call Grandpa tomorrow.

57
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,020
Okay.

58
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,900
You're coming back to Shanghai soon,
right?

59
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
Not so soon.

60

There's still follow-up rehabilitation

61
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,100
and regular check-ups are needed.

62
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,140
When you've fully recovered,

63
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,700
I'll personally come to pick you up.

64
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,740
Mom, it's not necessary.

65
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,300
It's getting late.

66
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,420
You should go to bed early.

67
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,300
Don't stay up.

68
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:15,940

Yes.

79
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,900
that her precious son can walk

80
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,180
and he's coming to the company
to help her.

81
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,700
He hasn't fully recovered yet.

82
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,340
He still can't return
to the country for now.

I acknowledge
Yunshen's research abilities.

But he's simply not suitable
for management.

Mom,

98
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,380
how long does this soup need to simmer?

99
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,700
It needs to simmer on low heat
for an hour.

100
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,060
One hour.

101
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Look at you.

102
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,420
You're over twenty years old.

103
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,180
But you still act like
an elementary school student.

104
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,540
I know, right?

105
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,620
I've lived a quarter of my life.

106
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,140
But I still don't know how to cook.

107
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,340
Mom,

108
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,100
why didn't you teach me sooner?

109
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,140
Because I didn't want you to learn.

110
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,700
If you don't know how to cook,

111
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,260
you don't have to cook for others.

112
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,820
But Mom,

113
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,980
I can't let Xizhou eat out anymore.

114
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,660
He had a gastric hemorrhage
from drinking too much a few days ago.

115
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,340
I felt so sorry for him.

116
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,420
My concern is all for you.

117
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,340
If you want Xizhou to eat at home,

118
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,940
why don't you hire a housemaid?

119
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,260
That won't do.

120
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,900
I want to cook for my family,

121
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,780
just like you do.

122
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,260
That's how you show love.

123
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,140
You silly child.

124
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,740
He lost his mind.

125
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,580
I can't figure out what is wrong.

126
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,220
When did you come back?

127
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,020
What's the matter?

128
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,140
You don't look good.

129
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,100
He just finished shooting a zombie movie

130
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,100
and hasn't removed his makeup.

131
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,940
Perdo extract.

132
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,660
Yunshen, can you take a look?

133
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,460
I've separated this from the inside.

134
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,980
But what's wrong with it?

135
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,100
Well.

136
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,340
I'll take a look for you,
my dear cousin.

137
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,020
Could there be a problem

138
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,460
with the chemical structure?

139
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,820
How is that possible?

140
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,820
Oh, that is the case.

141
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,780
That's where the problem is.

142
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,780
I've been working tirelessly
day and night.

143
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,860
That's why I was too tired to notice.

144
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,860
It must be it.

145
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,940
Thanks.

146
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,860
Thanks.

147
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,940
Leo, your coat!

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,460

149
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,100

Where to, sir?

151
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,740
Switzerland.

152
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,220
Switzerland? Let me see.

153
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,940
The postage would be 34 Euros.

154
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,340
Keep the change.

155
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,660
Thank you, sir.

156
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,980
What did you post?

157
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,740
A love letter.

158
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,620
I dare you to say that again.

159
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,180
I post a letter to my future wife.

160
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,780
Do you really want to receive it?

161
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,140
No, I don't.

162
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,300
What do you mean by that?

163
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,140
Hello?

164
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,340
Hello, Mint.

165
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,780
The professor is back.

166
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,140
He wants to meet you and Yunshen.

167
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,380
Okay.

168
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,420
The professor is back.

169
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,980
Let's go and visit him, then.

170
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,620
Uncle Hans,

171
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
how are you feeling?

172
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,380
Do you feel uncomfortable?

173
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,740
This is just an old ailment of mine.

174
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,300
Nothing to worry about.

175
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,060
I'm getting old now.

176
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,260
So it's about time to retire.

177
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,380
But it's a pity

178
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,700
that I discovered Danmin Disease.

179
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,740
But I didn't have the opportunity
to overcome it.

180
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,300
Do you mean the immune disease
in Country M?

181
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,860
Yes.

182
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,860
I named this disease

183
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,100
after the boy who died from it, Danmin.

184
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,140
Later,

185
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,420
I went to the northern highlands
for several investigations.

186
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,220
Nearby tribe area,

187
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,060
I've also found Danmin Disease.

188
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,660
All the patients are children.

189
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,420
Leo and the team have been working
on the medication.

190
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,340
I believe there will be
a positive outcome.

191
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,660
Yunshen,

192
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,380
I heard about your situation from Leo.

193
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,020
I'm really glad you've recovered.

194
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,180
Thank you, Professor Hans.

195
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,300
Normally, I shouldn't bring this up
considering all the suffering

196
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,500
you've gone through because of Perdo.

197
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,940
But over the past year,

198
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,780
we've tried various methods.

199
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,500
Only Perdo extract

200
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,780
has been the most effective
for Danmin Disease.

201
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,100
So,

202
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,060
I can only muster the courage

203
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,180
to ask you again.

204
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,940
You don't need to ask.

205
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,500
I'll help for sure.

206
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,780
Thank you, Yunshen.

207
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,380
Thank you.

208
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,660
Please focus on recuperating.

209
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,580
Leave everything to me.

210
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,370
[Yunshen]

211
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,780
Hello?

212
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,180
Xizhou,

213
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,780
it's me.

214
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,540
It's been a long time.

215
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,980
Yes, indeed.

216
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,460
How have you been?

217
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,340
Pretty good.

218
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,860
I can walk now.

219
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,740
Really?

220
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,220
Grandpa will be so happy.

221
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,820
Are you happy for me?

222
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,220
Of course.

223
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,020
Xizhou,

224
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,340
are you angry

225
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,740
that I haven't contacted you?

226
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,580
No.

227
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,780
I'm glad to hear that.

228
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,340
Chen Le told me
you were promoted to Vice President.

229
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,340
Congratulations.

230
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,300
So how about I come back and assist you?

231
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,820
Are you informing me

232
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,900
or asking for my opinion?

233
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,180
Of course, I'm asking for your opinion.

234
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,580
Then don't come back.

235
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,180
Why not?

236
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,740
You want to work on research, right?

237
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,180
The company can set up a lab for you

238
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,660
in Heidelberg.

239
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,060
I want Perdo.

240
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,220
You almost lost your life because of it.

241
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,460
Haven't you learned your lesson?

242
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:28,940
Xizhou,

243
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,900
that was really an accident.

244
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,940
An accident?

245
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,660
Listen to me carefully.

246
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,580
All accidents are caused by people.

247
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,060
So it was not considered an accident.

248
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,700
Xizhou...

249
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,980
I have a meeting.

250
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,220
I'm hanging up.

251
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,860
You're back.

252
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,060
Did I wake you up?

253
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,940
I'm sorry.

254
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,580
I had an emergency meeting today.

255
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,580
You should have told me.

256
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,100
You promised

257
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,900
to come back
and have dinner with me tonight.

258
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,140
It was too sudden.

259
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,660
It slipped my mind.

260
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,380
I called you multiple times,
but you didn't answer.

261
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,100
Don't you know I would get worried?

262
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,900
I'm sorry.

263
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,300
I left my phone in the office.

264
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,860
I know

265
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,500
you're really busy with work.

266
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,420
I've been trying to understand.

267
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,660
But I truly hope

268
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,500
you can consider
my feelings occasionally.

269
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,220
Can you do that?

270
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,900
Okay.

271
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,380
I'll make sure to be more mindful
in the future.

272
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,540
You haven't eaten yet, right?

273
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,580
Let me warm up the food for you.

274
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,900
You've made so many dishes.

275
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,820
Let me warm them up.

276
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,500
You haven't eaten either, have you?

277
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,820
Join me and have a few bites.

278
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,020
I'll warm these up.

279
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,100
Wait here.

280
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,220
[Thank you, Yunshen.]

281
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,060
What's wrong?

282
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,220
You look worried.

283
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,340
They say a man deep in thought
looks the most handsome.

284
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,140
I'm trying to act like one.

285
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,900
Mr. Fu,

286
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,020
did you know?

287
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,860
To me,

288
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,340
you're the most handsome
every day all year.

289
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,340
I didn't know

290
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,420
you gave me a high score.

291
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,100
What's up with you?

292
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,460
See if you remember them.

293
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,300
Isn't this Babulu?

294
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,100
He has grown taller and also grown up.

295
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,100
This is Liqi.

296
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,780
Mosang.

297
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,100
This kid

298
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,820
is the one I kicked.

299
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,500
Look at him frowning
while taking the photo.

300
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,500
I think he still hates me.

301
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,940
They all seem so happy.

302
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,380
I hope they can be happy forever.

303
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,900
Even when they're 20

304
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,020
or 30.

305
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,060
Up until they're 60.

306
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,900
Just like us.

307
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,620
Zhu Jiu.

308
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,820
I've talked to Leo.

309
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,900
I've decided

310
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,860
to work with him to develop medicine
for Danmin Disease.

311
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,900
Because of Perdo, you were...

312
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,380
Those were just some unexpected events.

313
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,620
I do hope we can develop a medication

314
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,060
to treat Danmin Disease
as soon as possible.

315
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,580
But I'm also afraid of
you getting hurt again.

316
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,980
I'm sorry, Dr. Zhu.

317
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
I've put you in a difficult position.

318
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,820
Will the company change its mind?

319
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,140
Chen Le said

320
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
there hasn't been much progress
with Perdo.

321
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,580
So I need to find a way
to persuade the company.

322
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,820
It won't be easy.

323
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,460
Doing research itself

324
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,460
is already not easy.

325
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,980
It's not as simple as one thinks.

326
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,500
Since you've decided,

327
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,580
what are you worrying about?

328
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,740
I don't like
long-distance relationships.

329
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,580
Just kidding.

330
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,980
Right now,

331
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,420
my mom and my brother
aren't getting along.

332
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,860
They clash a lot.

333
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,020
Like fire and water.

334
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,500
But both of them

335
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,220
are very important to me.

336
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,540
It's really hard to be stuck
in the middle.

337
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,860
Family relationships
are indeed hard to handle.

338
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,300
But I'm sure

339
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,260
you'll manage it well.

340
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,220
You have that much confidence in me?

341
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,540
Mr. Fu,

342
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,540
do you know when men
look the most handsome?

343
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,460
When do they look the most handsome?

344
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,860
- You don't know?
- I have no idea.

345
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,500
It's when they're working.

346
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,740
Go back.

347
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,860
I know you miss your lab.

348
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,220
But if I go back alone,

349
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,460
can I take you with me?

350
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,500
If you put it that way,

351
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,700
I might consider it.

352
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,700
Really?

353
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,340
Yes.

354
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,220
Grandma is getting older now.

355
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,620
I think I should be with her.

356
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,980
So, once I've sorted things out here,

357
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,020
I plan to go back.

358
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,980
How long will that take?

359
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,660
About three years, I guess.

360
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,140
Are you teasing me for fun, huh?

361
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,700
Is the scenery beautiful?

362
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,180
When we grow old in the future,

363
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,020
we'll keep horses and cows here.

364
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,900
We'll spend our days fishing
by the lake ahead.

365
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,660
Come in.

366
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,500
Grandpa.

367
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,020
Come, have a seat.

368
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,260
You wanted to see me?

369
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,380
I wanted to ask you

370
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,260
if you're facing any financial problems.

371
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,660
Grandpa,

372
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,220
what do you mean?

373
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,420
Ruanruan came to see me
a couple of days ago.

374
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,220
She wanted to sell me a painting

375
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,980
for over a hundred thousand yuan.

376
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,940
So I asked

377
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,580
if she could give me a discount.

378
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,340
She said no.

379
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,140
What's this?

380
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:30,860
Grandpa,

381
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,340
how much is the painting?

382
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,380
I'll pay you back the money.

383
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,860
What's this all about?

384
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,420
I've noticed you've been distant lately.

385
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,460
No.

386
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,540
You and your younger brother,
Yunshen are the same.

387
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,220
You two

388
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,980
used to be so close.

389
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,180
Nobody wanted that accident to happen.

390
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,100
When you said
you wouldn't contact him at the time,

391
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,380
I can understand.

392
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,980
But he's coming back soon.

393
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,140
We're a family, right?

394
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,220
Surely, we can overcome anything.

395
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,060
Grandpa,

396
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,460
I understand.

397
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,260
Okay, you can go about your business.

398
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Watch him.

399
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,420
Keep me updated if he makes any moves.

400
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,300
Okay.

401
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,820
Mr. Fu.

402
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,700
You can count on me.

403
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,660
So happy?

404
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,700
Are you tired?

405
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:45,940
Nope.

406
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,100
This person drives recklessly like you.

407
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,740
How am I reckless?

408
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,020
Not looking where you're going?

409
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,420
Where did we park?

410
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,420
Over there. Don't you remember?

411
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,460
What's wrong?

412
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,380
Look who's here.

413
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,540
Long time no see, Dr. Zhu.

414
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,700
What do you want?

415
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,100
Are you surprised I'm out?

416
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,260
Excuse me.

417
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,660
Dr. Zhu,
you have a really special taste.

418
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,460
I didn't know you like cripples.

419
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,460
Cripples?

420
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,420
Yunshen!

421
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,100
Let me go!

422
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,260
Let me go!

423
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,700
Well,

424
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,740
aren't you brave?

425
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,980
Not bad.

426
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,940
Dr. Zhu,

427
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,420
this is the man you want to be with?

428
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,980
Stop!

429
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,280
Look at him.

430
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,980
He's pathetic.

431
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,700
Do you like that?

432
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,220
Yunshen!

433
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,940
How about this feeling?

434
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,660
How about this one?

435
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,620
He'll never walk again.

436
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,060
Stop...

437
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,940
- I'll make sure.
- Stop...

438
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,660
Enough, let's get out of here.

439
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,660
Yunshen!

440
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,100
Yunshen.

441
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,980
Yunshen.

442
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,700
Yunshen.

443
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,380
Help!

444
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,140
I've sorted it out for you.

445
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,180
You sorted it out?

446
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,700
What did you do?

447
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,380
Xizhou.

448
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,620
Yes, Grandpa.

449
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,100
This time,

450
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,580
you've successfully secured
the Singapore market.

451
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,100
Well done.

452
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,020
It's my job.

453
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,440
You've been leading
the Marketing Department

454
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,380
over these past few years.

455
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,020
You perform really well.

456
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,260
You may be a bit young,

457
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,540
but you've always been reliable.

458
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,900
Now that you've been promoted
to Vice President,

459
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,580
you should keep up the good work.

460
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,620
I will.

461
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,620
Don't worry, Grandpa.

462
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,580
Xizhou,

463
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,940
I'm already old.

464
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,220
I can't work too much now.

465
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,780
Now, I'm counting on you guys.

466
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,900
I'll head back first.

467
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:11,820
Remember

468
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,220
not to work too late.

469
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,540
All right.

470
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,180
Come in.

471
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,060
Mr. Fu,

472
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,180
congratulations.

473
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,020
Thank you.

474
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,940
Those from the department
want to have dinner with you tonight.

475
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,180
But I know you're not too fond

476
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,380
of such social activities.

477
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,180
Sure.

478
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,300
Find a place.

479
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,180
My treat.

480
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,220
Really?

481
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:41,820
Okay.

482
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,500
Gather around.

483
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,580
Listen up, everyone.

484
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,220
Mr. Fu said

485
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,860
he's buying us dinner tonight.

486
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,180
Mint.

487
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,300
These are Mr. Fu's things.

488
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,460
See if we need anything else.

489
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,420
I'll bring them over.

490
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,500
Thank you.

491
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,420
What happened?

492
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,540
I thought you guys went out
to buy groceries.

493
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,860
How did he get hurt?

494
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,460
It was all my fault.

495
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,740
How is he?

496
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,140
The patient's spleen and liver
were previously injured.

497
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,220
And he suffered another severe blow.

498
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,220
This time, we perform surgery
to repair them.

499
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Is he okay?

500
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,740
Don't worry.

501
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,380
There's no danger to his life.

502
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,620
However, he'll require more careful care
in the future.

503
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:51,300
The lower limb venous thrombosis
caused by external trauma

504
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,020
has also been taken care of.

505
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,460
Will he be able to walk?

506
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,620
Use a wheelchair for now.

507
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,980
Mr. Fu's recovery

508
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,180
will take a while.

509
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,020
He'll be fine.

510
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
Why aren't you going inside?

511
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,820
I don't know how to face him.

512
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,500
It was all my fault.

513
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,220
I would rather have been the one
getting beaten.

514
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,980
Yunshen won't blame you.

515
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,460
He'll say

516
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,740
it's a man's duty
to protect his girlfriend.

517
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,860
He has really suffered a lot for me.

518
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,180
Now he can finally stand up.

519
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,900
If something really goes wrong,

520
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,100
I don't know
how hard it would be for him.

521
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,380
He was already planning to return home.

522
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,820
I know how much he misses his lab.

523
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,780
Don't worry too much.

524
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,340
Stephen told me

525
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,580
that using a wheelchair
is only temporary.

526
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,380
Go inside and see him.

527
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,620
Please just go and see him.

528
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,580
I'll come later.

529
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,180
Congratulations on your promotion!

530
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,540
To celebrate your promotion,

531
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,420
how about we make plans for the weekend?

532
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,340
I've already chosen the location.

533
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,700
Where?

534
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,540
Do you remember Ji Fenghe?

535
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,700
Her birthday is this weekend.

536
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,260
She wants to have a themed party.

537
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,740
I want to dress up as Sailor Moon.

538
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,740
You know it?

539
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,820
The one who says,

540
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,940
"In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you."

541
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,140
I rarely read comics.

542
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,380
Can you dress up as Tuxedo Mask?

543
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,180
Tuxedo... what?

544
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,660
Tuxedo Mask.

545
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,820
He's Sailor Moon's boyfriend.

546
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,340
Everyone else is bringing partners.

547
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,620
It would be too sad if I go alone.

548
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,100
So, can you go with me?

549
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,540
Just this once.

550
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,700
Just this once.

551
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,820
I'll go with you for sure.

552
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,220
Really?

553
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,900
Promise?

554
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,900
Then let's go and try on the costumes.

555
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,060
I've already bought them.

556
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,500
You already bought them?

557
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,300
Come on.

558
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,500
Hello? My son didn't answer my call.

559
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,500
Is he home?

560
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,620
Get him to the phone.

561
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,740
Ms. Jiang,

562
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,780
Mr. Fu is...

563
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,220
What's wrong?

564
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,940
Just tell me.

565
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,700
Mr. Fu is injured and hospitalized.

566
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,620
What?

567
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,020
Injured?

568
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,700
I'll fly over right away.

569
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:47,860
Ms. Kong,

570
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,100
book me the fastest flight
to Heidelberg.

571
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,220
Mr. Fu,

572
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,540
you must be very careful

573
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,020
not to injure your leg again.

574
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:12,900
Okay.

575
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,460
You also have to watch out

576
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:19,700
for complications
from venous thrombosis.

577
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,900
Thank you.

578
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,580
Dr. Zhu?

579
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
Have some water.

580
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,740
Are you planning to ignore me
from now on?

581
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,140
Here,

582
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,060
have a seat.

583
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:19,900
I'm sorry.

584
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,580
Why are you apologizing to me?

585
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,420
Leo told me

586
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,060
you've been blaming yourself all night.

587
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,660
I almost got you killed.

588
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,860
It was my fault

589
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,140
for not being able
to protect my girlfriend.

590
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,860
That's very humiliating.

591
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,260
Of course not.

592
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,460
Mark has already been arrested.

593
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,860
He was despicable.

594
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,100
Enough said.

595
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,740
Let's stop...

596
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,780
Yunshen!

597
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,340
Where are you injured?

598
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,660
Let me have a look. Quick.

599
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,580
Where? Your arm?

600
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,580
Are they okay?

601
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,340
Your shoulder?

602
00:40:59,500 --> 00:40:59,700
Mom?

603
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,180
Your back?

604
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,100
Tell me.

605
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,100
Is it your legs again?

606
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,940
Tell me quickly.

607
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,020
What happened?

608
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,580
Mom, I'm really okay.

609
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,580
What are you doing here?

610
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,540
You scared me to death.

611
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:10,820
Why

612
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,180
didn't you tell me

613
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,300
that you were hospitalized?

614
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,340
Why?

615
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,780
How did you get injured?

616
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,140
It was nothing.

617
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,980
It was a robbery

618
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,100
and some flesh wound.

619
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,580
Robbery?

620
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,460
It's too dangerous here.

621
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,380
This won't do.

622
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,180
You're returning to Shanghai with me
this time.

623
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,340
By the way, Mom,

624
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,980
let me introduce you.

625
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,100
She's my girlfriend,

626
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,380
Zhu Jiu.

627
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,740
Hello, Mrs. Fu.

628
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,260
Hello.

629
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,300
What did the doctor say?

630
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,300
When can you be discharged?

631
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,460
It's just a minor accident.

632
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,220
Don't worry.

633
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,500
With Dr. Zhu working

634
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,940
and taking care of me at this hospital,

635
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,620
you can rest assured.

636
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,820
I can take care of you.

637
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,260
Or you can have Linda take care of you.

638
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,500
Dr. Zhu is still in her working attire.

639
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,820
You must be on duty.

640
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,460
Aren't you guys busy?

641
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,700
It's almost time for me to go now.

642
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,540
Mrs. Fu,

643
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,540
I'll get going, then.

644
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,620
Yunshen.

645
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:06,900
Okay.

646
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,780
Remember to eat.

647
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,300
Here.

648
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,500
Have some water.

649
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,060
