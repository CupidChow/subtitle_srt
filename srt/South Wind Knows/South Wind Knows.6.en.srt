[Episode 6]

21
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,420
It's my birthday.

22
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,980
Why should I call him?

23
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,140
I guess

24
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,980
he has already forgotten
about my birthday.

25
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,140
That's impossible, Dad.

26
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,620
I'm sure there's no phone signal
where Yunshen is right now.

27
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,780
He discussed with me the other day

28
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,540
about what present

29
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,620
we should get for you.

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,860
I told him...

31
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,820
Zhizhi.

32
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,660

I'm sorry I'm late.

34
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,460
Mr. Fu, I got this present for you.

35
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,460
I wish you good health and a long life.

36
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,580
Thank you.

37
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,380
I'll place it over there.

38
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:11,740
Sure.

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,700
Have a seat.

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,780

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,180
It's a secret.

Let's dig in.

Let's wish Grandpa a happy birthday.

47
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,060
- Sure.
- Come on.

48
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,860
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Grandpa.

- Yun...
- Ms. Jiang.

What's the matter?

57
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,620
What happened, Shuning?

58
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,700
Yunshen went missing.

59
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,670

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,740

Are you feeling better?

62
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,220
I'm all right,

63
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,140
but I'm worried about Yunshen.

64
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,300
Danwei is not being helpful at all.

65
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,020
He said it was difficult to run a search
during the monsoon season.

66
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,580
I want to get discharged
as soon as possible,

67
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,700
- so that I can go there myself...
- Sure.

68
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,860
Wait. Calm down.

69
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,540
Focus on your own recovery first.

70
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,140
Perhaps

71
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,300
I should go there myself.

72
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,940
Elders shouldn't go there.

73
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,580
Grandpa.

74
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,900
Let me go.

75
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,980
Yunshen's safety is our priority now.

76
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,140
I'll reschedule
the contract signing tomorrow.

77
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,380
Don't worry.

78
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,020
It'd be better if you go,

79
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,900
but

80
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,340
you should be careful, too.

81
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,100
Dad.

82
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,500
I think I should go with him.

83
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,740
I can't rest assured.

84
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
Come on.

Zhizhi and I are worried about him.

93
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,060
But Zhizhi returned to the hospital first
for some emergencies.

94
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,260
I have no choice
but to come on her behalf.

95
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,940
This is not a game.

96
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,620
Go home.

97
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,060
You always regard me as a child.

98
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,420
I can help out.

99
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,100
Stop fooling around.

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:04,940
I'm not.

00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,100
Moreover,

102
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,980

109
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,060

111
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,980

112
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,780
Sure.

113
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,660

People with your status

126
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,460
should not walk with us.

127
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,620
Just return to the hotel
and wait for our good news.

128
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,700
Please.

Yes, I am.

145
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,500
I am starving.

146
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,220
I miss the plain noodles
my grandma used to make for me.

147
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,780
They are delicious.

148
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,780
Are you saying that the food I make
doesn't taste good?

149
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,700
It's good, too.

150
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,460
I want

151
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,580
wontons,

152
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,220
crab roe dumplings,

153
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,500
and mini rice dumplings.

154
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,420
Listen.

155
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,700
My hunch tells me

156
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,140
that Chen Le will rescue us very soon.

157
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,740
This is the 101st time you're saying this.

158
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,300
You can still count very well.

159
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,300
It seems like
you haven't lost your sanity yet.

160

We can still hang in there
for three more days.

Keep looking.

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,660
Did your mom say anything
about how to save yourself

163
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,660
when you're trapped
in a cave in her diary?

164
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,660
You're dreaming again.

165
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,300
This is not a dream.

166
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,740
Let's cheer ourselves up.

167
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,860

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,020
Let me read you a paragraph.

169
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,620

It's located at the border of Country M

173
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,940
and is a place
with rich natural resources.

174
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,340
Because of its fertile land

175
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,660
and rich natural resources,

176
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,900

How did it go?

187
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,700
If the rain gets heavier,

188
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,660
we'll be able to swim out of this place.

193

My question is:

201
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,900
Two dogs were racing.

202
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,100
The first dog ran fast.

203
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,420
The second dog ran slowly.

204
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,740
They arrived at the finish line.

205
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,180
Who sweated the most?

206
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,500
The third dog.

207
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980

208
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,580

209
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,020

00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,740
Leave now.

381
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,300
Hurry up and leave.

382
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,540
I'm tired. I need to sleep.

383
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,100
Gu Ruanruan.

384
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,580
Close the door.

385
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,700
She lost her memory after the kiss.

386
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,260
That doesn't make sense, right?

387
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,740
I do look good.

388
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,060
You look great.

389
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,500
Seems like you're feeling fine.

390
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,100
Xizhou.

391
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,740
Take a good rest.

392
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,780
We'll leave once the chopper arrives.

393
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,980
Are we leaving so soon?

394
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,860
You've been here long enough.

395
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,740
What's the matter?

396
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,020
Are you reluctant to leave?

397
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,700
That's not true.

398
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,260
But

399
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,540
Professor Hans

400
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,780
wants to set up a temporary clinic here.

401
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,700
There isn't enough manpower
in the village,

402
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,700
so I think I should stay and help out.

403
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,420
I think that's not the only reason

404
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,500
you want to stay here, right?

405
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:54,780
Xizhou.

406
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,060
I realized

407
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,220
that since you started hanging out
with Gu Ruanruan frequently,

408
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,660
you have become nosier.

409
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,300
Has she influenced you?

410
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,740
It's been so long since you left.

411
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,460
The R&D Department is missing its leader.

412
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,820
It's time for you to go back.

413
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,460
I understand.

414
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,540
But I still have some business
to take care of.

415
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,780
After giving it a thought,

416
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,140
I think you're still the best candidate
for this role.

417
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,820
I can't help you

418
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,860
with the acquisition
of the herb harvesting rights.

419
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,300
This is the final step.

420
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,260
You should do it yourself.

421
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,060
When you return, you can redeem yourself
in front of all the directors.

422
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,140
I don't want that, Xizhou.

423
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,580
You know I hate
business negotiations the most.

424
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,700
I don't care
what the board of directors thinks of me.

425
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,340
They can say whatever they want.

426
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,060
I will count on you

427
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,340
to acquire the herb harvesting rights.

428
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,460
Why are you always like this?

429
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,300
I'm feeling dizzy and headache again.

430
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,300
I'm not acclimated
to the environment here yet,

431
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,740
so I can't take too much stress.

432
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,100
Are you having a headache?

433
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,100
You're not acclimated
to the environment, huh?

434
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,700
Say it again.

435
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,100
Does your butt hurt?

436
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,980
It doesn't.

437
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:10,820
Xizhou.

438
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,060
Please...

439
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:16,820
All right.

440
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,420
I'll talk to the Chief in the afternoon.

441
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,660
Xizhou, you're the best.

442
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,300
By the way,

443
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,300
I've called home and reassured them,

444
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,020
but you should call them yourself.

445
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,540
Grandpa is worried about you.

446
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,900
Don't worry, Xizhou.

447
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,900
Okay.

448
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,860
Mind your steps.

449
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:50,940
Xizhou.

450
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,620
Don't shove.

451
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,940
I know. I know.

452
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,220
One by one.

453
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,780
One by one.

454
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,180
I know.

455
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,140
Don't shove.

456
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,460
Boss.

457
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,500
Eat something.

458
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,580
You are tired, but you still
need to eat something.

459
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,060
Why are all of you eating here?

460
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,460
This isn't working.

461
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,580
We can't start our work at all.

462
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,500
This place lacks medical care
all year round.

463
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,500
Once the villagers heard
that we were giving free consultations,

464
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,780
all of them showed up.

465
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,540
Professor.

466
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,820
Why don't we give out queue numbers?

467
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,620
Then, we can treat the patients
in sequence.

468
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,460
What do you think?

469
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,740
That's a good idea.

470
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,300
Mr. An.

471
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,420
Can you please do a headcount later?

472
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,740
Prepare the queue numbers

473
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,140
and distribute them to the villagers.

474
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,780
Sure.

475
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,260
Let's work in groups of two.

476
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,260
- Of course.
- Sure.

477
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,820
Sen and I will team up.

478
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:42,620
Sen.

479
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,540
Let's go.

480
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,420
The potato pancake is really delicious.

481
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,620
It contains a lot of
plant-based ingredients.

482
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,620
Give it a taste.

483
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,020
Don't you enjoy having all the nice food
back in Shanghai?

484
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,540
You are putting a lot of effort
into winning Xizhou's heart.

485
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,740
I'll bring this to Xizhou.

486
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,540
I'll bring this to Xizhou.

487
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,980
I'm glad to hear that you're all right.

488
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,900
Zhizhi, you're here.

489
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,580
I was talking to Yunshen about you.

490
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,780
Yunshen.

491
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,020
You should talk to Zhizhi...

492
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,500
Hey.

493
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,020
The phone call got cut off
all of a sudden.

494
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,940
It's fine.

495
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,340
Perhaps the signal was poor.

496
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,940
Madam Jiang.

497
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,020
How are you feeling today?

498
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,460
I'm feeling much better now.

499
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,780
I'm fine.

500
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,420
Zhizhi.

501
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,420
Thanks for taking care
of me in the past few days.

502
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,620
Yunshen told me

503
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,140
to thank you on his behalf.

504
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,100
Zhizhi.

505
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,460
You're a nice girl,

506
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,260
but you're not proactive enough.

507
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,380
It's all right for girls
to take the initiative.

508
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,980
Look at Ruanruan.

509
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,580
I see, Madam Jiang.

510
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,260
You've recovered.

511
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,700
You can be discharged this afternoon.

512
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,740
I'll get back to work.

513
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,460
- Take a good rest.
- Sure.

514
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,300
Hello.

515
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,500
Wait a minute.

516
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,740
Hey, Li Zhen.

517
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,580
I want to ask you

518
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
how Danmin is doing.

519
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,700
He's getting better

520
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,700
and has a good appetite.

521
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,340
He had a huge bowl of porridge for lunch.

522
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,180
Please pay extra attention to his legs.

523
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,300
Don't let the wound get infected.

524
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,220
I got it.

525
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:40,820
Thank you so much.

526
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,580
I guess you're not used
to the food here, right?

527
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,260
Eat this.

528
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,220
It can boost your energy.

529
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,500
Thank you,

530
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,260
but I don't have a sweet tooth.

531
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,420
We've finally distributed
all the queue numbers.

532
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,100
Hopefully, they will follow the schedule

533
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,060
and get their treatments in order.

534
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,620
Don't worry.

535
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,260
Chen Le and I will be there tomorrow.

536
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,020
Be careful.

537
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,620
- Don't worry. Keep walking.
- There's a step here.

538
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,820
You're doing pretty well.

539
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,300
Be careful.

540
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,100
You should be careful, too.

541
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,180
Are you all right?

542
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,420
I'm fine.

543
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:01,740
Zhu Jiu.

544
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,660
I have an academic question for you.

545
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,300
What is it?

546
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,140
Can low blood sugar make one
lose the memory?

547
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,620
Are you done yet? Let's go.

548
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,300
I can't cross this.

549
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,220
You should go first.

550
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,380
What makes you think
that I can cross this?

551
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,140
Hurry up.

552
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,020
Here.

553
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:31,820
Are you all right?

554
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,740
Is this the right attitude
during the academic communication?

555
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,060
You changed the subject
as soon as I brought it up.

556
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,660
You're blushing, too.

557
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,860
Are you feeling shy?

558
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,020
Fu Yunshen.

559
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,780
Since we are having
an academic discussion,

560
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,140
can I ask you a question, too?

561
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:51,780
Sure.

562
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,420
Who is Zhou Zhizhi?

563
00:31:59,220 --> 00:31:59,700
Watch out.

564
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,780
Think twice before you give me an answer.

565
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,740
We're not in a hurry.

566
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,060
Gu Ruanruan, it's you again.

567
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,180
I'm coming. Wait for me.

568
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:16,980
Hello, Mr. Fu.

569
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,340
Mr. Xie admires a popular artist a lot.

570
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,820
Her name is Ji Fenghe.

571
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,220
But she rarely sells her works publicly.

572
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,220
He failed to purchase any of her works
despite having hired many buyers.

573
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,540
Figure out a way.

574
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,460
I tried making offers to her,

575
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,060
but she turned down all of them.

576
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,660
But coincidentally,

577
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,740
she collaborated with your gallery before.

578
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,740
Ms. Gu was in charge of her exhibition.

579
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,780
You may talk to Ms. Gu

580
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,380
and see if she can help.

581
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,380
Ruanruan?

582
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,420
Yes.

583
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,180
Okay. I got it.

584
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,980
What's your relationship with Zhu Jiu?

585
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,060
How did you know each other?

586
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,020
When did you become friends?

587
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,580
What stage is your relationship at?

588
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,140
Fu Yunshen, please cooperate.

589
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,820
Gu Ruanruan.

590
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,380
Go to Xizhou.

591
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,140
Fu Yunshen, open the door!

592
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,660
Come out now!

593
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,460
Fu Yunshen!

594
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,380
Ruanruan.

595
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,460
Xizhou.

596
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,940
- What brings you here?
- Slowly.

597
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,820
Why are you torturing Yunshen again?

598
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,740
Zhizhi asked me to keep an eye on him.

599
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,020
I have to do something about it.

600
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,140
What brings you here?

601
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,300
I want to ask you for a favor.

602
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,100
You want me to do you a favor, huh?

603
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,260
That's so rare.

604
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:41,980
Tell me now.

605
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,340
I will do everything for you.

606
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,700
Do you know an artist

607
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,580
named Ji Fenghe?

608
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,500
I do.

609
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,660
She's my friend.

610
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,380
Do you remember
the seven balls of crumpled paper?

611
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,420
She did that.

612
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,420
It left a strong impression on me.

613
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,020
Are you looking for her?

614
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,460
I want to purchase one of her artworks.

615
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,860
That's easy.

616
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,820
I can help you.

617
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,100
Thanks.

618
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,460
It's no biggie.

619
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,740
Anything else I can help you with?

620
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,820
You should rest early.

621
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,900
I'll continue my interrogation.

622
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,420
Fu Yunshen.

623
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,500
Come out now!

624
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,820
Now!

625
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,380
- All done.
- You can bring him home.

626
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,900
Bye, little boy.

627
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,700
All right.

628
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,260
- Thank you.
- Remember to drink more water.

629
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,420
Sen.

630
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,020
I have a patient here.

631
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,820
He needs your advice.

632
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,060
Dr. Zhu, I want to consult you, too.

633
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,540
What is this?

634
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,060
My queue number.

635
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,750
[See you by the drying rack tonight.]

636
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,620
I'll see you tonight.

637
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,340
How childish.

638
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,260
What are you talking about?
You look so happy.

639
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,100
Let me join your conversation.

640
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,380
You are already a happy person.

641
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,020
Gu Ruanruan.

642
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,300
You should be with Xizhou, not here.

643
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,060
I'm here to keep an eye on you
on behalf of Zhizhi.

644
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,420
Stop making things up.

645
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,340
I always take Zhizhi
as my younger sister.

646
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:40,940
Besides,

647
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,580
stop saying nonsense.

648
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,580
Leave now.

649
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,860
I'm not leaving.

650
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,540
Professor.

651
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,100
I wish to come over
to take a few photos tomorrow.

652
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,380
Will I disturb you?

653
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,300
Of course not.

654
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,260
You're always welcome here.

655
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,580
Thank you.

656
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,500
Gu Ruanruan.

657
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,020
You're here with an agenda, huh?

658
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,660
I won't be here
if I don't have an agenda.

659
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,820
You found a very high spot.

660
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,620
Be careful.

661
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,260
I like your shirt.

662
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,340
Dr. Zhu.

663
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,180
It seems like you're recovering well.

664
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,620
I'm feeling pretty good.

665
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,620
Why did you ask me to come?

666
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,700
Nothing special.

667
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,140
I simply want to continue
our academic discussion.

668
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,180
Also,

669
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,500
I want to help you restore your memory.

670
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,100
I don't talk about work during my break.

671
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,140
Professor, why are you here?

672
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,140
So annoying.

673
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,180
Are you able to recall it now?

674
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,740
If you still can't recall it,

675
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,020
I can reenact the scene for you.

676
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,340
It's fine. I can recall what happened.

677
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,260
Zhu Jiu.

678
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,420
I knew you were faking it.

679
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,540
What? Are you feeling shy again?

680
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,740
Fu Yunshen.

681
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,420
Since this is an academic discussion,

682
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,140
we should both contribute
to the discussion.

683
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,020
Do you remember who Zhou Zhizhi is now?

684
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,220
You're so curious about me, huh?

685
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,700
Are you jealous?

686
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,700
You're beating around the bush.

687
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,700
You must be guilty of something.

688
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,900
I have nothing to hide.

689
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,180
I can tell you everything.

690
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,060
Really?

691
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,500
Make sure you ponder upon it
before you give me the answer.

692
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,700
Let's see if the story I heard

693
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,060
is the same
as the one you're going to tell me.

694
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,540
Of course, my version of the story is rue.

695
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,820
Gu Ruanruan

696
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,580
is always talking nonsense.

697
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,740
My family and the Zhou family
go way back.

698
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,860
My mom and the other elders

699
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,980
arranged an engagement for us
when we were babies.

700
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,780
However,

701
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,020
I always regard Zhizhi and Ruanruan
as my younger sisters.

702
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,140
So you were childhood sweetheart.

703
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,740
Zhu Jiu.

704
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,220
Apparently, Gu Ruanruan
didn't tell you anything.

705
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,900
Zhu Jiu.

706
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,260
My brother and I are going back soon.

707
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,060
We have stayed here long enough.

708
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,100
There are a lot of things in the company
we have to take care of.

709
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:32,980
All right.

710
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,780
Then...

711
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,860
Is there something in your mind
that you want to tell me?

712
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,780
Fu Yunshen.

713
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,060
I...

714
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,700
There's something I want to tell you.

715
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,300
Then,

716
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,420
you can't let this opportunity slip.

717
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,020
I'm leaving very soon.

718
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,820
Do you remember

719
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,420
that you borrowed 200 dollars from me

720
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,900
when we were at the outdoor market?

721
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,140
You haven't paid me the interest yet.

722
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,340
Double interest, remember?

723
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,020
Keep the change.

724
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,660
Are you done with this now?

725
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,060
Such a money-grubber.

726
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,220
Dr. Zhu.

727
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,390
♪Close your eyes♪

728
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,910

Xizhou.

735
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,420
What brings you here?

736
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,740
Do you have anything to tell me?

737
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,460
Although it's not our first time
seeing each other,

738
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,540
I feel different every time I see you.

739
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,740
Cut to the chase.

740
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,180
I have got you Ms. Ji's artwork.

741
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,260
Tell Chenghuan

742
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,060
to pick it up from her studio tomorrow.

743
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,420
Do we need to pay her anything?

744
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,540
Nothing.

745
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,420
Don't worry.

746
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,740
Ms. Ji said

747
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,500
that she would offer you
a discounted price for my sake.

748
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,860
Thank you, Ruanruan.

749
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,300
Xizhou.

750
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,020
Am I really just getting a thank-you?

751
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,020
Are there no other rewards?

752
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,740
What do you want?

753
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,060
I want you.

754
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,100
It's getting late.

755
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,020
You should go to sleep.

756
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,580
Be good.

757
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,380
I'm leaving, then.

758
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,580
I'm going to change
if you continue to stay here.

759
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,580
I'm really leaving.

760
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,140
By the way,

761
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,500
how did your negotiation
with the Chief go?

762
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,500
He said the herb harvesting rights go
to the local government.

763
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,660
That's good.

764
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,580
You should arrange a meeting with them
as soon as possible.

765
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,460
Since we are already here,

766
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,620
let's go back after you close the deal.

767
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,860
Since you're so good
at planning my schedule,

768
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,180
you should come with me.

769
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,060
No.

770
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,180
