you've never planned

198
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,500

the disinvestment one hour later.

215

Back then,

375
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,900
Lingtian Group was in trouble.

376
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,700
For the company,

377
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,220
I forced your father to marry your mother.

378
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,580
To save our company,

379
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,580
he left Lin Zhi.

380
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,820
Xizhou wasn't even two years old.

381
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,060
When your father knew
your mother was pregnant with you,

382
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,180
he thought his mission was over.

383
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,980
So, he abandoned everything

384
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,100
and went away.

385
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,900
Then, Lin Zhi

386
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,220
[Tomb of Lin Zhi, by Fu Xizhou]
had severe depression.

387
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,700
Xizhou lived a terrible life then.

388
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,060
I didn't take Xizhou home

389
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,980
until Lin Zhi was sent

390
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,420
to a psychiatric hospital.

391
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,540
It was my mother

392
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,460
who sent Ms. Lin there, right?

393
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,060
Your mother was a victim, too.

394
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,420
It was me

395
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,340
who used her love for your father.

396
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,940
What's done is done.

397

398
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,100
Throughout my life,

399
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,620
I've been working on a balance

400
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,060

401
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,580
I don't want to owe anyone.

402
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,460

403
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,820

404

406

But remember.

407
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,060

408
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,860
