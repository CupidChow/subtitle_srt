[Episode 24]

21
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,180
(Based on the patient's condition,)

22
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,340
the best way

23
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,620
is to do
a living-related liver transplant.

24
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,060
The risk will be much lower.

25
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,980
What is a living-related transplant?

26
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,940
It is a match from a lineal descendant.

27
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,100
Doctor.

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,740
As long as it can save my mom,

29
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,020

How long can she still live

31

after getting this transplant?

32
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,060
Theoretically,

33
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,540
if we exclude other underlying diseases,

34
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,220
a living-related liver transplant
is very effective.

35
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,060
That's because the rejection rate
is low.

36
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,460
And for some patients,

37
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,260
they may not even need
anti-rejection medication.

38
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,900
Then, would it be dangerous

39
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,620
for the liver donor?

40
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,100

Is there a great risk
for this operation?

48
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,140
The danger of this operation
is having postoperative complications.

49
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,300
But the operation is now very developed.

50
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,500

188
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,180
I ate a lot for dinner.

189
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,980
Nonsense.

190
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,100
You didn't eat much.

191
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,660
Is something wrong?

192
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,900
Did you fight with Xizhou?

193
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,260
No.

194
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,700
It has nothing to do with him.

195
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,180
I'm just exhausted from work lately.

196
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,980
What do you want for tomorrow?

197
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,060
I'll make it for you.

198
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,660
Then I'll take you out for a meal.

199
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,860
You can go shopping with me.

200
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,460
It's been so long
since we went shopping together.

201
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,780
Okay.

202
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,660
Go to bed early, then.

203
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,220
I will.

204
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
You must finish it.

205
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,100
Okay.

206
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,620
Good night, Mom.

207
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,620
Good night.

208
00:11:52,690 --> 00:12:04,140
[Dr. Johnson]

209
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,740
Hello?

210
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,900
Really?

211
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,580
Great. Thanks.

212
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,020
I'll be right there.

213
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,660
Okay. Thank you.

214
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,500
Mr. Fu.

215
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,220
These are the data you asked for.

216
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,100
Thank you.

217
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,100
Mr. Fu.

218
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,460
Thank you.

219
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,260
You're welcome.

220
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,980
How's it going?

221
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,300
[Hospital]

222
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,100
The test results are out.

223
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,100
Dr. Zhu.

224
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,420
Your blood type is not a match
for the patient.

225
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,340
Madam Zhu.

226
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,180
Your blood type
and mechanism compatibility

227
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,100
with the patient
are likelier to succeed.

228
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,940
That's great, Aunt!

229
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,100
We can save Granny.

230
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,140
How can that be?

231
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,380
A match for a lineal descendant

232
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,660
is highly successful.

233
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:08,900
Doctor.

234
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,820
Can you explain to me in detail

235
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,620
how the operation is done?

236
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,380
How much of my liver will be cut off?

237
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,780
Will it recover?

238
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,340
The patient's condition is serious now.

239
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,180
So we need to cut off

240
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,220
at least 60% of your right liver.

241
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,820
Sixty percent?

242
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
That's a lot!

243
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,820
I thought it wasn't only a little.

244
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,780
Aunt.

245
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,220
The liver of the human body
can regenerate itself.

246
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,740
If the operation goes well,

247
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,460
it can grow back to normal
in three months.

248
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,340
Still,

249
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,900
I'm the one who will be cut open.

250
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,420
Doctor.

251
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,180
After I undergo this operation,

252
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,660
will it affect my body?

253
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,060
Surgeries

254
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,740
will always come with risks.

255
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,580
But the technology now
for liver transplants

256
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,820
has become relatively developed.

257
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,620
"Relatively developed"?

258
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,820
Doctor.

259
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,340
I don't mean it that way.

260
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,940
I'm just curious.

261
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,300
If we choose

262
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,860
to wait for a donor,
how long would it take?

263
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,980
That's hard to say.

264
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,300
The availability is limited,

265
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,980
while the demand is high.

266
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,380
However,

267
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,020
living-related liver transplant

268
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,620
has its advantages.

269
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,580
Since families

270
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,940
are blood-related,

271
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,780
after

272
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,660
getting the transplant,

273
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,820
the rejection rate will be very low.

274
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,620
On top of that,

275
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,740
before doing the operation,

276
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,700
we will conduct
a thorough checkup for you

277
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,700
to make sure you are healthy enough.

278
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,820
Then I might not be qualified.

279
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,580
My body isn't well.

280
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,100
I have hyperlipidemia.

281
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,780
My heart is weak too.

282
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,140
Lately,

283
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,380
I have been having headaches

284
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,420
and insomnia.

285
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
My heart hurts now.

286
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,340
My chest feels tight too.

287
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,380
I'm going outside to get some air.

288
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,860
Aunt.

289
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,700
Aunt.

290
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,500
Where are you going?

291
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,420
I need to use the washroom.

292
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,900
Washroom is that way.

293
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,860
I'll take you there.

294
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,780
Yang's classes will be over.

295
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,260
I need to go home and cook for him.

296
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,340
Aunt.

297
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,460
Are you having second thoughts
about donating your liver to Granny?

298
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,860
Granny can be on the waiting list,

299
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,540
but she is old
and her condition is serious.

300
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,780
She can't afford to wait.

301
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm aware of that.

302
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,460
But you heard it earlier.

303
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
The doctor said

304
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,020
I'd have to cut off 60% of my liver.

305
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,460
I'm really terrified.

306
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,420
I know

307
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,900
that if I refuse to donate it,

308
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,740
you will definitely look down on me.

309
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,900
Still,

310
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,260
she is my mother.

311
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,140
I obviously want to save her.

312
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
But, Zhu Jiu,

313
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,020
you know my family's situation.

314
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,740
I'm in a predicament.

315
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,700
Yang is going to
junior high school soon.

316
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,140
Now is the time
he needs to be taken care of the most.

317
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,580
What if I get hospitalized

318
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,500
and don't make it out alive?

319
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,980
Then Yang will be...

320
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,780
Both of them are dear to me.

321
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,380
But Aunt, Granny is...

322
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,700
Oh, no!

323
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,060
Yang's classes are going to be over.

324
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,340
We don't

325
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,580
necessarily have to make
this decision today, right?

326
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,300
We'll talk tomorrow.

327
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,220
I've got to go.

328
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,380
Hi.

329
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,580
Okay.

330
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,460
Thank you.

331
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:12,780
No thanks.

332
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,500
I don't drink.

333
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,540
What's the matter?

334
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,980
Any thoughts
on the cold chain transportation?

335
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,100
Nothing at the moment.

336
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
I need some time.

337
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,260
What about your end?

338
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,740
There's definitely no problem
with the vaccine.

339
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,500
The problem is likely

340
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
something that went wrong
during transportation.

341
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,220
Malaysia

342
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,900
has always been very strict
with the cold chain.

343
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,460
There is no absolute perspective
in anything.

344
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,900
Perhaps personal stakes
are involved in this.

345
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,220
You're finally using your brain

346
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,860
for things
other than research and development.

347
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,180
Should I be happy

348
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,860
or worried?

349
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,780
If you die from drinking,
how will you fight with me?

350
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,620
Schedule a meeting with Mr. Xie.

351
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:57,940
Yunshen.

352
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,100
Why are you still up?

353
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,140
I'm going to bed soon.

354
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,300
But

355
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,020
I have something very important

356
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,140
that haven't done.

357
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
What's the matter?

358
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,380
What?

359
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,060
Come closer.

360
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,260
A little closer.

361
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,540
Thank you, Zhu Jiu.

362
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,460
Is everything going well?

363
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,860
The hospital here
has completely changed its attitude.

364
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,660
But you owe someone a favor now.

365
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,700
Not really.

366
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,540
My ex-classmate's cousin

367
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,700
happened to be working at that hospital.

368
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,540
She often copied my homework in school.

369
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,980
That's why

370
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,260
she's returning my favor.

371
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,100
The advantages of having a girlfriend
who's a top student.

372
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,260
I'm so lucky to have you.

373
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,740
Yunshen.

374
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,540
Rest early.

375
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,540
Do you miss me?

376
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,660
Once I finish my work here,

377
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,180
I will come back very soon.

378
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,060
Okay.

379
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,060
Good night.

380
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,380
Good night.

381
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,300
These are the blood test reports
of the sick children.

382
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,980
They all caught the flu

383
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,420
due to vaccine failure.

384
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,420
We are aware that the vaccine
has a problem.

385
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,260
What we want to know is
which part of it went wrong.

386
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,300
These are the active sampling graphs
I've done

387
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,500
on the same batch of vaccines
in my country.

388
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,100
You can look through it carefully.

389
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,900
This basically eliminates

390
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,540
the problem of its quality.

391
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,100
So in terms of the vaccine,

392
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,420
its quality is extremely safe.

393
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,380
This is just a result from your end.

394
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,620
To be fair,

395
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,100
we want a sampling test too.

396
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,020
Be my guest.

397
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,860
I have brought the samples.

398
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,220
The sampling inspection is secondary.

399
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,420
Since you say there is no problem
with the vaccine's quality,

400
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,500
then which part caused it to fail?

401
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,620
Cold chain transportation.

402
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,380
Impossible.

403
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,100
Malaysia has a hot climate.

404
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,740
So we have always been strict
with the refrigeration.

405
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,410
I have checked
the refrigeration environment

406
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,300
of the hospital involved.

407
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,580
They meet all the standards.

408
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,180
So the problem would only occur
during the cold chain transportation.

409
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,660
Your country
was part of the transportation too.

410
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,700
Shouldn't you investigate it
starting from there?

411
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,500
Investigations are already in place,
Mr. Xie.

412
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,980
Why are you so anxious?

413
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,220
Are you feeling guilty?

414
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,620
Why would I feel guilty?

415
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,900
Instead, it's you.

416
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,180
Every word you said

417
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,900
seemed to imply
it was our responsibility.

418
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,780
Mr. Xie.

419
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,940
You can rest assured.

420
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,060
I will investigate

421
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,340
the cold chain transportation

422
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,460
thoroughly.

423
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,380
Whether it's Lingtian or your company,

424
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,140
I will handle this just and fair.

425
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,980
If so, we'll wait
for the investigation results.

426
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:47,940
Mr. Xie.

427
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,300
Before we have the results,

428
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,100
I hope your company
can cooperate with Lingtian

429
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,300
and act with caution.

430
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,980
The most important thing

431
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,060
is to appease

432
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,420
those sick children and their families.

433
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,780
Mr. Fu Jr.

434
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,340
I know what to do.

435
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,580
You don't have to teach me.

436
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,660
I am greatly relieved

437
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,180
to hear that from you.

438
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,220
Give it to me!

439
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,060
This money is for Yang.

440
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,820
Give it to me.

441
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,980
- Or I will hit you!
- No...

442
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,980
You're an animal!

443
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,700
Aunt!

444
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,460
Open the door!

445
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,940
Aunt!

446
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,860
Open the door!

447
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,100
What's going on?

448
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,660
If you don't open up,
I'll call the police!

449
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,660
Aunt!

450
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,100
Who is it?

451
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,220
Aunt.

452
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,740
- Aunt.
- Zhu Jiu.

453
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,100
Why are you here?

454
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,380
Why is your hand bleeding?

455
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,460
I'm going to call the police!

456
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,260
Really?

457
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,860
Will the police

458
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,540
care about how I discipline my wife?

459
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,540
Let's find out.

460
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,060
Zhu Jiu, no!

461
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,060
I'm fine.

462
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,380
- I'm alright.
- You hear that?

463
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,820
She said she's alright.

464
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,980
Besides,

465
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,380
I just hit my wife a few times.

466
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,660
What's the big deal?

467
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,020
Those people in your family

468
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,020
wish she would get cut

469
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,220
and offer her liver.

470
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,460
Stop pretending to be nice here!

471
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,140
Give it to me.

472
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,340
What are you doing?

473
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:43,980
Hand it over!

474
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,420
No!

475
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,420
Stay away from my aunt!

476
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,540
What are you doing?

477
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,580
You are an animal!

478
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,660
That's money for Yang's tuition classes!

479
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,340
I know it's for him.

480
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,860
I will pay you back double

481
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,060
after winning today's bet!

482
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,500
Keep the wound dry.

483
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,740
Don't get it wet these few days.

484
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,580
Thank you, Zhu Jiu.

485
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,540
Does he hit you often?

486
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,340
No.

487
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,340
Recently,

488
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,860
he lost his job.

489
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,580
So he's been in a bad mood.

490
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,100
Why didn't you tell us?

491
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,220
What's the point?

492
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,780
Your granny is old.

493
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,180
You're a young lady.

494
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,540
I can't be expecting you two
to fight for me.

495
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,540
Besides,

496
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,780
quarrels between spouses

497
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,980
aren't nice things to share.

498
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,500
Domestic violence

499
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,820
will never end at one time.

500
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,380
If you condone him,
he will only become more violent.

501
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,540
It's not a big deal
for husband and wife to fight.

502
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,620
I'll just give in to him in the future.

503
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,700
He wanted money from me today,

504
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,700
but I refused.

505
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,620
That's why he hit me.

506
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,260
Gambling as a habit is a bottomless pit.

507
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,780
How can you keep living like this?

508
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,460
I don't have a choice.

509
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,620
I'm not like you.

510
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,820
You studied abroad.

511
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,380
You're capable.

512
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,020
You can find a good partner
in the future.

513
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,180
But

514
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,580
I didn't study well when I was young.

515
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,180
Now, I can only earn money
through labor.

516
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,820
I have to make do with what I've got.

517
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,780
I forgot to ask you.

518
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,860
Why are you suddenly here?

519
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,260
Is it because your granny
isn't feeling well?

520
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,460
No.

521
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,700
Granny is alright.

522
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,780
I just noticed that you didn't look well

523
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,300
when you left last time.

524
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,900
So I came to check on you.

525
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,340
I'm alright.

526
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,220
I'm good.

527
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,780
Yang will be back soon.

528
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,020
I need to clean this up.

529
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:25,660
Let me help you.

530
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,860
No...

531
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,820
Stay still.

532
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,540
There are broken glasses everywhere.

533
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,100
You might cut your hand.

534
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,980
Sit.

535
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,100
It will only take me a moment

536
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,020
to do it.

537
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,740
Aunt.

538
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:57,740
Here.

539
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,780
Hold on to this money.

540
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,420
It's for Yang.

541
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,940
I'll get going.

542
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,060
Zhu Jiu.

543
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,460
If you came

544
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,340
to talk me into getting the operation,

545
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,820
then take the money back.

546
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,140
You have seen what's going on

547
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,460
in my family.

548
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,380
If anything happens to me,

549
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,180
your uncle won't take care of Yang.

550
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,580
So

551
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,140
I really don't have a choice.

552
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,980
Aunt.

553
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,380
That's not what I meant.

554
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,220
I will take care of Granny's matters.

555
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,500
I'm off.

556
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,850
[Welcome to
Shanghai International Airport]

557
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,660
Boss.

558
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,620
It feels like
I haven't seen you in ages.

559
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,980
You're as handsome as ever.

560
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,460
You must be tired, Mr. Fu.

561
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,260
Let me guess.

562
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,620
To the hospital?

563
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,420
Where's the car?

564
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,700
In the basement parking lot.

565
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,180
You'll get fined for parking here.

566
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,700
Boss.

567
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,460
Here.

568
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,140
For you all.

569
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,060
Mr. Fu is here
to show off his love again.

570
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,540
But Dr. Zhu isn't here.

571
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,700
Anything yummy?

572
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,340
She went to the greenhouse alone.

573
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,420
Are you missing me, Dr. Zhu?

574
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,940
You look so serious.

575
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,060
Did I get it right?

576
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:36,980
Why?

577
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,940
What happened?

578
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,100
Yunshen.

579
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,860
Granny is sick.

580
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,740
It's liver cancer.

581
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,300
She needs a liver transplant.

582
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,340
I did a compatibility test.

583
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,540
But it wasn't a match.

584
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,820
Getting a donor is a problem now.

585
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,100
Besides, Granny is old.

586
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,860
The risk of surgery is high.

587
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,700
I still haven't got to spend much time
with her.

588
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,620
Don't be sad.

589
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,460
You should have told me sooner.

590
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,580
We could find a solution together.

591
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,420
I wanted to tell you at first.

592
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,420
But I know

593
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,940
you had difficult matters to handle too.

594
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,220
When two people are together,

595
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,580
not only should they share the good,

596
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,900
but they should also
bear the bad together.

597
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,900
Didn't you tell me that?

598
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,620
Don't feel discouraged. Don't be sad.

599
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,540
I'm sure
we will find a solution together.

600
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,700
I haven't told Granny about her illness.

601
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,180
Zhu Jiu.

602
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,820
As her family

603
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,780
and a doctor,

604
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,580
it would affect her emotionally.

605
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,820
But with her condition now,

606
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,780
she must be hospitalized at once.

607
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,020
No one in this world

608
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,620
knows Granny better than you do.

609
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,420
She is strong. Am I right?

610
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,100
I'll tell her once I get home.

611
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,020
Why didn't you get changed?

612
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,940
I'm not going back.

613
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:54,860
Ruanruan.

614
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,860
I was wrong

615
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,740
for not keeping

616
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,220
my promise to you.

617
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,020
How about this?

618
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Let's fix another date.

619
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,060
I will ask Cheng Huan
to look for a better church

620
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,900
to hold the ceremony.

621
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,060
Okay?

622
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,300
What's the point?

623
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,980
We can no longer

624
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,620
go back to that day no matter what.

625
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,420
We can no longer go back to that church.

626
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,580
I'm tired.

627
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,620
Fu Xizhou.

628
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,420
Let's get a divorce.

629
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,220
Darling.

630
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,180
Shouldn't the test result be out by now?

631
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,380
Is it not good?

632
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,700
Just tell me.

633
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,420
Be honest with me.

634
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,060
Granny.

635
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,700
It's liver cancer.

636
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,860
Late stage.

637
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,900
Granny.

638
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,420
Don't worry.

639
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,140
Medicine is so advanced now.

640
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,260
Allow me.

641
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,460
Slowly does it.

642
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,820
Let's go.

643
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,660
To the hospital.

644
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,980
Put on your clothes.

645
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,620
Don't just stand there.

646
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,380
You're a doctor.

647
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,420
I have you.
I have nothing to be afraid of.

648
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,540
I will get treated.

649
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,540
[Emergency Entrance]

650
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,220
(Granny.)

651
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,100
I brought you some new books.

652
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,580
These are your favorites.

653
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,260
You can do some reading here
when you rest.

654
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,580
Granny.

655
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,660
Chief Sun from the Department
of Hepatobiliary Surgery

656
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,780
will run a systematic examination
this afternoon.

657
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,980
I will be here too.

658
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,700
But

659
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,860
don't delay your work because of me.

660
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,940
I won't.

661
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,140
I have talked to Chief Sun.

662
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,940
The best solution now
is a liver transplant.

663
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,100
Don't worry about the money.

664
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,020
Okay.

665
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,340
I'll do as you say.

666
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,340
But you must think carefully

667
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,780
if doing this is worth it.

668
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,700
I'm already so old.

669
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:12,820
Okay.

670
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,100
I will.

671
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,580
Granny.

672
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,620
I've done the paperwork.

673
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,260
Sorry to have troubled you.

674
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,340
Thank you.

675
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,540
I'll come and visit you tomorrow.

676
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:27,980
Okay.

677
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,940
I'll leave it here.

678
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,820
Go on.

679
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,700
Get back to work.

680
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,700
Granny.

681
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,620
I'll come and see you again.

682
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,100
Rest well.

683
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,780
Call the nurse if you need help.

684
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,020
Or you can call me.

685
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:44,580
Okay.

686
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,540
Hurry.

687
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,900
Your patients are waiting for you.

688
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:48,860
