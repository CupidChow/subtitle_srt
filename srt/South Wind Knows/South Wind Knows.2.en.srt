00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,100
Everything is good here.

194
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,180
What do you think?

195
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:36,860
Good.

196
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,260
Do you want to eat something? Drink tea?

197
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:40,780
Okay.

198
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,380
Okay.

199
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
This is for you.

200
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,980
I'll go and make tea for you, okay?

201
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,020
This is our local delicacy.

202
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,540
It's really delicious.

203
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,340
Okay, here.

204
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,820
Do you want to use the phone?

205
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,100
We have a phone here.

206
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,180
You can use it.

207
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,100
Here.

208
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:45,900
Okay.

209
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,380
Okay, thank you. Have a nice day.

210
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,380
Thank you.

211
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,260
If you need anything, just call me.

212
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,060
Okay?

213
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,940
Okay, bye-bye.

214
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,780
Thank you, bye-bye.

215
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,940
His life is stable now.

216
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,740
You can go to the ward to see him.

217
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,900
Thank you.

218
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,700
Sorry.

219
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,660
On your left.

220
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,380
Mint.

221
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,820
It's been so long.

222
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,300
Indeed it has. I miss you so much.

223
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,180
You've grown up. More beautiful.

224
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,220
Thank you.

225
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,780
You did a great job
in the operation room.

226
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,700
You're the proud of your parents.

227
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,740
By the way,

228
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,300
what the kid has

229
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,860
just looks like the immune disease

230
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,260
Uncle Hans talked about.

231
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,820
That's right.

232
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,460
Hans discovered this disease

233
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,820
in nearby villages and remote tribes.

234
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,300
You'd need to help with the research.

235
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,060
Of course.

236
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,980
Glad to help.

237
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,420
Can you speak English?

238
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,340
How much?

239
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,340
Thank you.

240
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,020
Do you know Anson?

241
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,420
Here?

242
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,020
Okay, thank you.

243
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,060
Hi, how are you?

244
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,460
What can I do for you?

245
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,060
I'm looking for Anson.

246
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,140
There he is.

247
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,740
Thank you.

248
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,780
You're welcome.

249
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,820
Here you are, your juice.

250
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,060
Thank Uncle Anson.

251
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,700
- Thanks, Uncle.
- Take care, okay?

252
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,780
Bye.

253
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,140
Bye.

254
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,860
Good day, Mr. Anson.

255
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,140
My name is Fu Yunshen.

256
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,220
Professor Hans recommended me to you.

257
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,180
I would like to invite you
to be my local guide.

258
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,220
I'm sorry.

259
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,460
I'm not available now.

260
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,020
It won't take long.

261
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,900
At most 20 days.

262
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,140
My wife is pregnant.

263
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,620
I need to take care of her.

264
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,460
Moreover, the monsoon season
is approaching.

265
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,380
Now is not a suitable time
to go into the mountains.

266
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:50,940
I know.

267
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,620
I want to leave
before the monsoon season,

268
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,100
so I need your help.

269
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,580
Name your price.

270
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,580
I won't go regardless.

271
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,100
Please leave.

272
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,740
Please consider this again, Mr. Anson.

273
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,180
Mom.

274
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,140
Dad.

275
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,020
Danmin.

276
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,220
It's okay, I'm here.

277
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,180
Is it a power outage?

278
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,740
The electricity is off.

279
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,980
Please help me to look after him.

280
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,980
Hold his leg down.

281
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,660
Relax.

282
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,140
It's going to be okay soon, Danmin.

283
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,780
Take a deep breath, Danmin.

284
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,860
Thank you.

285
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,500
It's all right now.

286
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,220
♪Twinkle, twinkle, little star♪

287
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,860
♪How I wonder what you are♪

288
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,580
♪Up above the world so high♪

289
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,180
You're sleepy, aren't you?

290
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,660
Not really.

291
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,020
Go back and rest.

292
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,780
Just leave the torch here.

293
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,180
It's okay.
I can stay for a little longer.

294
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,380
Dr. Zhu.

295
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,300
Are you afraid of the dark?

296
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,980
Not really.

297
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
Thank you for today.

298
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,740
You're welcome.

299
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,900
Does power outage happen frequently here?

300
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,900
We don't experience this everyday,

301
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,420
but it's a frequent occurrence.

302
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,180
The electric generator is too old.

303
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,860
It frequently malfunctions
and requires repairs.

304
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,900
It's inconvenient
for the aid station, then.

305
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,180
Have they thought of any solutions?

306
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,420
Young master.

307
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,340
Your clothes are dirty.

308
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,580
Do you need me to help you wash it?

309
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,260
Good night.

310
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,140
Hang it out.

311
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,020
A-B-C-D-E-F.

312
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,980
Hello.

313
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,900
- Hello.
- Hello.

314
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,020
Come on.

315
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,300
Here.

316
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,340
This way.

317
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,180
I'll do it.

318
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,580
You're not used to this, right?

319
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,580
Be careful.

320
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,060
I'll hold this.

321
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,780
Okay.

322
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,460
Come on.

323
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,140
Let's do this.

324
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,420
Hello, Boss.

325
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,900
I'm on my way.

326
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,180
I'll meet you soon.

327
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,300
Please don't come yet.

328
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,140
Go back first.

329
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,700
I need you to buy something.

330
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,700
What do you need?

331
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,860
I'll share the list with you.

332
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,620
Mr. Fu.

333
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,860
Have you found the local guide?

334
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,380
When can we enter the mountains?

335
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,420
I visited him yesterday.

336
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,420
He turned down the offer.

337
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,660
What should we do then?

338
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,500
Aunt Addy said if we were going
during the monsoon season,

339
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,020
we need a local guide
to secure our safety.

340
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,460
Is Dr. Addy very reputable here?

341
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,660
This station was established by Aunt Addy

342
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,980
and her friend.

343
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:21,660
Dr. Zhu.

344
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,860
Do me a favor.

345
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,540
Let's go
to the local guide's house together.

346
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,580
Perhaps he would change his mind

347
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,900
for the sake of Dr. Addy.

348
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,140
This is a win-win situation.

349
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,460
You help yourself by helping me.

350
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,340
All right, then.

351
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,180
However, I need to work here in the day.

352
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,140
I can only go in the evening.

353
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,300
Okay.

354
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,980
This is really good cloth.

355
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,500
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.

356
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,140
I think it's okay for both.

357
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,380
We meet again, Mr. Anson.

358
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,700
If you're here for that,

359
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,740
you can leave now.

360
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,340
Let me go see the others.

361
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,300
Let's go.

362
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,020
Please reconsider this.

363
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,500
Are you okay?

364
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,260
I'm okay.

365
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,700
Be careful.

366
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,020
Sen.

367
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,060
Sen.

368
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,940
It's been a while.

369
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,700
Dr. Zhu.

370
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,020
Did you know each other?

371
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,500
Dr. Zhu.

372
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,180
What's wrong with my nephew?

373
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,660
He's fine.

374
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,180
You can breathe freely again.

375
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,340
Thank you.

376
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,260
You're welcome.

377
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:07,860
Sen.

378
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,780
About the local guide,

379
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,500
please consider it again.

380
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,420
Dr. Zhu.

381
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,420
You saw it too.

382
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,220
My wife is pregnant.

383
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,620
She needs someone to look after her.

384
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,540
I'm sorry.

385
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,580
Yes, I understand.

386
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,420
Aunt Addy told me, too.

387
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,540
But I heard
that there are a lot of patients

388
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,380
like Danmin in nearby villages.

389
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,980
They are all kids.

390
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,900
I want to go into the mountains

391
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,940
to research the cause of the disease.

392
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,900
I really need your help.

393
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,100
Anson.

394
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,420
Just promise them, okay?

395
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,900
This is our first child.

396
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,380
I want to keep you company.

397
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:58,940
I know

398
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,500
that you miss the southern mountains
and forests very much

399
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,900
when you're at home during this time.

400
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,460
But...

401
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,860
Helping them is also

402
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,140
helping children like Danmin.

403
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,620
I was so sad when Danmin was sick.

404
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,340
Is it not more than 20 days?

405
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,380
That's right.

406
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,140
I'll do this.

407
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,740
Looking forward to working with you.

408
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,140
Thank you, Madam.

409
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,580
Thank you, Sen.

410
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,540
Thanks.

411
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,740
Inform me
when the departure time is confirmed.

412
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,420
Okay.

413
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,700
We won't disturb you, then.

414
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,500
Let's go.

415
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,220
Well, Dr. Zhu.

416
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,820
You turn out to be rather useful.

417
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,300
Of course.

418
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,020
That's right.

419
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,340
I need to treat you to a meal.

420
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,580
Really?

421
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,740
Can I order whatever I want?

422
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,220
As you wish.

423
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:03,940
Come on.

424
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,740
I want this one and this one.

425
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,340
Okay.

426
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,820
Make it spicier.

427
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,820
Okay.

428
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,460
Thank you.

429
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,220
Okay.

430
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,180
Is that all?

431
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,140
I wanted you to treat me
to something nice too,

432
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,980
but this is the best restaurant here.

433
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,220
Their food is amazing.

434
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,100
Hello.

435
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,460
We're rich.

436
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,620
Why are you buying a bird's nest?

437
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,820
Fu Yunshen.

438
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,700
This is a lamp cover.

439
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,140
Do you see it now?

440
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,620
I want this one, this one, and this one.

441
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,180
Okay.

442
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,020
All of them, thank you.

443
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,900
Let me help you.

444
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,500
Thank you.

445
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,060
You don't have to buy so many things.

446
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,860
You don't understand.

447
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,140
These local handcrafts

448
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,580
are popular in Germany.

449
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,140
This is called lucky grass.

450
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,780
Thank you.

451
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
Lucky grass.

452
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,340
This is Vetiver.

453
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,620
Did you die
of poverty in your previous life?

454
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,180
This type of grass
has its medical benefits,

455
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,460
yet it's commonly used
in daily chemical and perfume products.

456
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,140
You're a doctor,

457
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,980
yet you're so superstitious.

458
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,580
You really don't understand.

459
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,420
This is the local traditional culture.

460
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:37,940
How much?

461
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,860
20 dollars together.

462
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,780
Okay.

463
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,020
20 dollars.

464
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,340
Thank you.

465
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,500
These are for you.

466
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,780
They're immortal grass wristbands.

467
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,340
Couples wearing them
can never be separated.

468
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,180
Thank you.

469
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,460
Sir.

470
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,100
We're not a couple.

471
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,780
Never mind then.

472
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,620
I can sell it better in a pair.

473
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,340
Thank you.

474
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,580
Goodbye.

475
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,980
Goodbye.

476
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,300
Hello.

477
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,620
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

478
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,420
Thank you.

479
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,580
You have to eat it with your hands.

480
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,660
Place the meat on it.

481
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,140
It tastes so good when it's wrapped.

482
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,740
Meal's on me. Eat more.

483
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,820
You should eat. It's really good.

484
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,700
How much?

485
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,500
Five dollars.

486
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,060
Okay.

487
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,660
Are you okay?

488
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,820
I'm okay.

489
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,700
Wait a moment.

490
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,660
Seriously, Fu Yunshen?

491
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,660
Why are you intending to cheat
when it's already so cheap?

492
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,380
Are you sure that I'm someone like this?

493
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,620
Well.

494
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,340
I lost my wallet.

495
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,140
Can you lend me some money?

496
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,220
I'll pay it back to you later.

497
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:46,820
Fine.

498
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,180
It's not much.

499
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:48,980
I'll pay.

500
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,300
- Five dollars?
- Thanks.

501
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,780
- Yes. Five dollars.
- I will pay it back to you for sure.

502
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,620
Thank you.

503
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,540
Eat more since we pay for it.

504
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,740
It tastes delicious.

505
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,180
What's wrong?

506
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:18,820
Dr. Zhu.

507
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,340
Can you lend me some more money?

508
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,300
I want to buy something.

509
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,060
Do you want to borrow some money?

510
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,140
Well, I can borrow you some money.

511
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,980
Seriously?

512
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,060
Double the interest.

513
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,500
Are you a loan shark?

514
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,100
Not really.

515
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,980
If you don't want the money,
never mind then.

516
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,460
Okay. Fine.

517
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,060
I'll record a video as proof.

518
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,740
Seriously? This tactic again?

519
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,500
I have no choice.

520
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,780
What if you're lying to me again?

521
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,260
Have you always been cheated?

522
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,180
Kind of.

523
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,980
How much do you need?

524
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,060
200 dollars.

525
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,060
This much?

526
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,380
I need to return more
if I borrow more money.

527
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,500
You're right.

528
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,380
Why don't you borrow more money?

529
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,300
Well.

530
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,100
How about you borrow 500 dollars from me?

531
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,380
800 dollars is fine.

532
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,220
How much do I have?

533
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,660
- Forget it.
- You can take all my cash.

534
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,340
Are you all right?

535
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,460
- I'm fine.
- Thank goodness.

536
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,740
Wait here. I'll go after him.

537
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:38,780
Well.

538
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,940
Why didn't you run now?

539
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,940
Give it to me.

540
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,820
Well.

541
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,380
You stole both of them?

542
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,500
Fu Yunshen.

543
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,980
He stole our stuff, and that's all.

544
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,140
You didn't have to hit him this hard.

545
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,060
I didn't.

546
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,180
You couldn't carry these now, could you?

547
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,540
Come on, let me help you.

548
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,980
Wow! You're unexpectedly amazing.

549
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,580
But that kid had a great fall.

550
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,060
I'm not sure if the police
will send him to the hospital.

551
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,540
Why are you worried about him?

552
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,300
You shouldn't have saved him earlier.

553
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,380
You should let him endure the pain.

554
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,220
So, he'd learn his lesson.

555
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,260
He broke his leg.

556
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,700
He had his lesson.

557
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,540
Stop worrying about his leg.

558
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,700
Locals here despise robbers.

559
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,940
They'd chop off their hands and legs.

560
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,900
He can save his money on getting a cast.

561
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,540
Is it true?

562
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,780
Of course.

563
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,220
This is their religion's law.

564
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,620
Theft is a serious offense.

565
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,780
If one commits theft,
his family will be punished too.

566
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,140
Is that so?

567
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,500
Liar.

568
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,060
What are you doing?

569
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,820
Gentlemen won't hit people.

570
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,900
When did I say that I'm a gentleman?

571
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,340
If you come any closer,
I'll throw this away.

572
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,180
I dare you.

573
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,180
A gentleman doesn't fight with a lady.

574
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:40,820
Take it.

575
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,940
See you tomorrow.

576
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:57,900
Grandpa.

577
00:38:59,220 --> 00:38:59,980
What brought you here?

578
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,020
I'm here to visit you.

579
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,700
I brought you some fruits.

580
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,580
Are you feeling better now?

581
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,620
Of course. How else would I feel?

582
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,540
It's just a normal routine check-up.

583
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,100
Yet Zhizhi insisted I
stay in the hospital for two days.

584
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,620
She's a doctor, yet she's overreacting.

585
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,740
It's always good to be mindful.

586
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,700
You fainted at home last month.

587
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,940
We were so scared.

588
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,020
I'm all right.

589
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,860
Right.

590
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,060
Since you're here,

591
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,060
help me
to settle the discharge procedure.

592
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,380
Grandpa.

593
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,860
Listen to the doctor.

594
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,740
Stay in the hospital for two more days.

595
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,460
I'll surely get sick
if I stay any longer.

596
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,020
Every year,

597
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,980
Yunshen would accompany me
and fetch me from the hospital.

598
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,300
I wonder

599
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,980
how he is doing there now.

600
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,220
He didn't even bother to give me a call.

601
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,500
I gave him a call.

602
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,100
He's doing fine there.

603
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,700
He's heading to the mountains now.

604
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,780
So, it's hard to reach him
due to the poor signal strength.

605
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,620
You're always siding with him.

606
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,540
Poor signal strength?

607
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,220
He's afraid that I might scold him.

608
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,020
I told him not to go,
yet he insisted to go.

609
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,100
My goodness.

610
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,900
Maybe I can call him now.

611
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,420
No, don't call him.

612
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,900
Let him do whatever he likes.

613
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,100
Your brother

614
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,740
isn't as reliable as you.

615
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,020
Come in.

616
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,540
Mr. Fu.

617
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,220
Mr. Fu.

618
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,540
Your medical report
has been partially released.

619
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,740
I've read it briefly.

620
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,660
You're okay.

621
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,940
What about the rest of the report?

622
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,300
It will be delivered
to my place later, right?

623
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,780
You do this every year.

624
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,940
I'm well aware of this.

625
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,900
You

626
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,980
have a different agenda, don't you?

627
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,820
Your true intention...

628
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,700
Mr. Fu.

629
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,100
Although your results seem fine,

630
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,100
for your age,

631
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,900
you must control your blood sugar level.

632
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,660
I've notified the nutrition department.

633
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,540
They will rearrange your diet plan.

634
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,020
Please follow the diet.

635
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,420
If I follow the diet,

636
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,980
I'd die
before next year's routine check-up.

637
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,300
Mr. Fu.

638
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,540
Just give it a try.

639
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,460
If it's not to your liking, let me know.

640
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,860
I'll ask the nutrition department to revise it.

641
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,900
It's for the sake of your health.

642
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,060
Fine, okay then.

643
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:12,940
Yes.

644
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,620
You may go to work.

645
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,260
Have him take care
of the discharge procedure for me.

646
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,780
Okay.

647
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,420
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

648
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,540
Why is it you who came
to fetch Mr. Fu from the hospital?

649
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,420
Where is Yunshen?

650
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,580
Yunshen is
on a business trip to Country M.

651
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,180
Country M?

652
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,220
When did he go?

653
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,220
Two days ago.

654
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,780
I didn't know about this.

655
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,660
When will he return then?

656
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,420
It's not confirmed yet.

657
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,540
Mr. Fu's birthday is approaching.

658
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,940
If Yunshen isn't around,

659
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,420
he will surely be upset.

660
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,780
Where can I handle
the discharge procedure?

661
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,380
First floor.

662
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,260
I'll take you there.

663
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,700
Why are you shouting?

664
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,740
