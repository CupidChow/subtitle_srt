[Episode 13]

21
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,070
Yunshen is away,

22
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,190
so it'd be great
if you could watch it for him.

23
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,670
Is Yunshen...

24
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,710
How is he lately?

25
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,270
Haven't you talked to him?

26
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,910
I called him,

27
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,670
but he never picked up my call.

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,150
He never replied to my messages.

29
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,710
He's not doing very well.

30
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,430
Does he still refuse treatment?

31
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,310
Given Yunshen's condition,

32
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,510
he really needs a caretaker.

33
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,950
But he wouldn't stay in Shanghai

34
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,270
and refused to let me stay
with him in Heidelberg.

35
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,750
I am truly concerned.

36
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,510
Wouldn't it be great

37
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,590
for him to have a doctor like you,

38
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,190
who is kind and thoughtful,

39
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,350
by his side?

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,110
Madam Jiang,

41
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,350
I get where you're coming from.

42
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,110
I've mentioned to Yunshen

43
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,630
that I could go to Heidelberg

44
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,830
and look after him there.

45
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,430
But he turned me down.

46
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,190
And you just gave up after one attempt?

47
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,270
But given his condition,

48
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,270
I don't want to upset him further.

49
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,350

Sometimes, men don't like women
who do as they are told.

52

You've been in love with Yunshen
for years.

53
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,630
Why haven't you made any progress?

54
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,110
This is a chance.

55
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,230
Make the most out of it.

56
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,350
How about this?

57
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,350
You're taking an annual leave next week.

58
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,110
Go to Heidelberg and bring Yunshen back.

59
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,990
It's easier for you to look after him.

60
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,710
What do you think?

61
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,750
I see, Madam Jiang.

62
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,350
Eat up.

63
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,230
Yes.

00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,470
will never happen again.

Hello? Yunshen?

74
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,950
What's wrong with you?

75
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,150
You finally answer my phone.

76
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,670
Hello.

77
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,150
Hello?

78
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,470
May I know if this is
Fu Yunshen's phone number?

79
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,110
Yes.

80
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,590
I'd like to speak to Yunshen.

81
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,350
Could you pass the phone to him?

82
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,470
It's late.

83
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,790
I'm afraid it's not very convenient.

84
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:13,750

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,950
Are you going home?

88
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,350
The medicine is ready.

89
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,790
Heat it up for him tonight.

90
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,470
Are you coming tomorrow?

91
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,590
I don't know how to prepare the medicine.

92
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,150
I'm afraid of bugs.

93
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,510
I must get going.

94
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,630
I read all his files.

95
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,470
But for specific decisions,

96
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,790
I have to see the patient.

97
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,270
I understand.

98
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,430
Neural damages are best
to be treated within two years.

99
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,990
The prognosis will be worse
for your friend

100
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,390
if there is any delay.

101
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,070
He has tried many treatments,

102
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,750
but none of them worked.

103
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:37,030
He can try olfactory ensheathing
cells transplantation.

104
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,190
I looked into this procedure.

105
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,270
But it's still in the clinical trial.

106
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,590
The risk is unclear.

107
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,790
Yes, but there are also successful cases.

108
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,430
You can read this

109
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,590
and think about it.

110
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,430
Okay, fine.

111
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,750
Thank you.

112
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,710

113
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,270

Get out.

118
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:51,990
Please, Yunshen.

119
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,590
Get out!

120
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:58,830
Yunshen...

121
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,630
Get out!

122
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,590
Now!

123
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,950

125
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,030
How is he?

126
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,670
He's all right.

127
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,550
He didn't get hurt.

Mint.

129
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,150
You don't have
to prepare the medicine tonight.

130
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,470
Mr. Fu wants me to tell you

131
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,950
to move out.

132
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,940
I expected this.

133
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,860
I don't know how much longer
I can take this.

134
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,540
Linda.

135
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,700
Don't worry.

136
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,460
I'm never leaving.

137
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,100
Really?

138
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,500
Thank you so much.

139
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,620
I should get to work.

140
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,220
Mom.

141
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,540
I'm hungry.

142
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,100
What would you like?

143
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,780
Soup?

144
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,580
I'll ask Miss Tao
to bring you chicken soup.

145
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,500
That should replenish your strength.

146
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,980
I knew my son

147
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,340
wouldn't be defeated so easily.

148
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,380
Mom.

149
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,340
Don't worry.

150
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,540
I'll receive the treatment

151
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,260
and get well.

152
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,660
I'll return to the company.

153
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,940
I have so many ideas for my research

154
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,460
that haven't been realized.

155
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,220
If you get well,

156
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,260
you will have

157
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,660
my full support.

158
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,740
Come, follow me.

159
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,940
Pretend you're feeling it moving.

160
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,740
Move harder,

161
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,020
even if you can't feel it.

162
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,580
Madam Jiang,

163
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,980
what happened?

164
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,420
Fracture in the leg.

165
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,500
He's going through surgery.

166
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,180
How did it happen?

167
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,980
The doctor said Yunshen
overdid it during his therapy.

168
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,700
Can my son still stand?

169
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,220
The result of his treatment

170
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,500
is lower than our expectation.

171
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,540
Are you using the right method?

172
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,860
We've tried all of our methods on him.

173
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,780
The treatment he's receiving

174
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,060
is the best solution we have.

175
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,780
But it's been so long.

176
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,180
Why hasn't he made any progress?

177
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,620
We've done our best.

178
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,500
Would you consider transferring him
to a different hospital?

179
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,580
The doctor says

180
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,700
the wound has healed.

181
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,860
You can take a bath today.

182
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,140
The water is ready.

183
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,380
Leave.

184
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,180
But how do you take a bath on your own?

185
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,180
Besides,

186
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,900
I can't just leave you here alone.

187
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,500
Leave.

188
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:30,900
Boss.

189
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,980
You can't take a bath on your own.

190
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,380
You need help with it.

191
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,300
Leave!

192
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,780
If you need help,

193
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,740
just call me.

194
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,260
Boss, be careful.

195
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,260
The floor is very slippery.

196
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,620
Boss?

197
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,820
Are you all right?

198
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,580
I told you you'd need help.

199
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
Let me give you a hand.

200
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,860
Don't touch me.

201
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,100
Boss, just listen to me.

202
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,380
Don't touch me!

203
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,180
Boss.

204
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:51,940
Come on.

205
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,580
Listen to me.

206
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,620
Don't touch me!

207
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,900
Will you cut it out?

208
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,660
Stop it.

209
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,620
Do as I say.

210
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,460
How is it, Boss?

211
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,740
Is the water warm enough?

212
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,060
Here.

213
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,460
Body wash

214
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,660
and shampoo.

215
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,060
Let me help you with it.

216
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,900
Come.

217
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,780
Boss.

218
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,380
You don't have to do this.

219
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,460
Your legs

220
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,980
will get well slowly over time.

221
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,700
Right?

222
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,740
Give it a wipe.

223
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,220
Get well.

224
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,060
Come on, clean yourself!

225
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,020
Fu Yunshen!

226
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,820
Fu Yunshen!

227
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,620
Are you still the man I once knew?

228
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,140
Are you still the man I once knew?

229
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,100
Look at me!

230
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,900
Stop acting this way!

231
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,260
Get yourself together!

232
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,980
Fu Yunshen.

233
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,100
Look at me.

234
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,380
Look at me.

235
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,740
Where is your confidence?

236
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,100
Get yourself together.

237
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,330
Yunshen?

238
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,370
Yunshen?

239
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,170
Yunshen? Yunshen!

240
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,130
- Not me!
- Yunshen?

241
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,490
Yunshen,

242
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,610
you're safe now.

243
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:15,770
Was it a nightmare?

244
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,570
What are you doing here?

245
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,050
I heard some noises,

246
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,490
so I came to check on you.

247
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,290
Have some water.

248
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,170
I'm fine now.

249
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,410
You may leave.

250
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,250
I have an idea.

251
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,250
Let me tell you a bedtime story.

252
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,090
Okay?

253
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,970
I'm getting into the mood.

254
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,730
Wait a moment.

255
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,090
There it is.

256
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,930
Long ago,

257
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,090
there was a big rabbit

258
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,010
and a small bunny.

259
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,410
One night,

260
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,410
the two of them
were gazing at the moon on the roof.

261
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,130
The big rabbit said,

262
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,650
"Look!

263
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,410
The moon is big and round."

264
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,730
Then, the bunny said,

265
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,570
"Round."

266
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,690
I'm speechless.

267
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,250
What's wrong with the story?

268
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,450
It has a place, time, and characters.

269
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,410
All right.

270
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,570
I'm sleepy.

271
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:12,690
I need to sleep.

272
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,050
You may leave.

273
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,290
Would you like me to read

274
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,610
from my mom's storybook?

275
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,490
Never mind.

276
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,890
I'm going back to sleep.

277
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:40,970
Goodnight.

278
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,010
Goodnight.

279
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,490
Goodnight, Fu Yunshen.

280
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,650
Goodnight.

281
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,890
Just how many tonics have you bought

282
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,050
for Fu Yunshen?

283
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,770
Are these even going to work?

284
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,250
No idea.

285
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,010
Just give everything a try.

286
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,730
Yeah.

287
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,770
You gave up
on taking the corporate title exam

288
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,250
to see him in Heidelberg.

289
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,770
I don't know if Yunshen is touched,

290
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,410
but I'm moved to tears.

291
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:53,850
Ruanruan.

292
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,730
Do not tell Yunshen.

293
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,890
As for the examination,

294
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,930
I can retake it next year.

295
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,130
Ruanruan.

296
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,410
You always told me

297
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,050
that I should be braver

298
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,250
and more proactive.

299
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,650
I've made up my mind.

300
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,010
This time,

301
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,690
I'll fight for my chance.

302
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,810
Once you've decided,

303
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,290
give it your best and see it through.

304
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,930
You'll always have my support.

305
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,370
Thanks.

306
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,170
All the best.

307
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,210
I'll wait for your victorious return.

308
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:32,730
All the best.

309
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,170
I must get going.

310
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,090
Text me as soon as you arrive.

311
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:41,650
Bye.

312
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:10,810
Have you lost your mind?

313
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,370
Not your concern.

314
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,370
Can you not be such a nuisance?

315
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,490
You're only a doctor I hired
to get me healed.

316
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,490
You have no right
to intervene in my life.

317
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,250
Fine.

318
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,850
You want to get drunk?

319
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,130
Let's do it together.

320

Fu Yunshen.

321
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,210
I've put up with you long enough!

322
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,490
Are you ignoring me?

323
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,170
You're ignoring me
on purpose, aren't you?

324
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,930
Because I am simply too charming.

325
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:43,850
You...

326
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,490
You're ignoring me.

327
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,010
You refuse to look at me.

328
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,330
What is the meaning of this?

329
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,650
Seriously, I've put up
with you long enough!

330
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,490
Who do you think you are? A vampire?

331
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,250
Why is your room so dim?

332
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,210
You know what?

333
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,130
Back then,

334
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,490
you said

335
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,250
I was your family doctor.

336
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,330
You...

Mint, good morning.

341
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,300
Good morning.

342
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,380
Are you all right?

343
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,580
Not bad.

344
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,860
You skipped dinner last night.
I bet you're starving.

345
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,940
You need something light after a drink.

346
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,700
Here.

347
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,140
Have some porridge.

348
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,300
Thank you.

Thank you.

Don't thank me.

352
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,180
Mr. Fu ordered me to prepare this.

353
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,300
Mr. Fu is actually a nice person.

354
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,860
But he has a bad temper.

355
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,260
However, given his condition,

356
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,140
it's understandable.

357
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,460
Here.

358
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,180

Come in.

361
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,860
Mr. Fu.

362
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,620
We received news from Singapore.

363
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,620
Somehow, Luo Jiang managed

364
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,860
to bypass the staff

365
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,260
and meet Mr. He directly.

366
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,860
How capable of him.

367
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,420
But it doesn't matter.

368
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,260
He works for Ms. Jiang.

369
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,180
Besides, the deal from Singapore

370
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,620
is pivotal to you.

371
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,140
I fear he might...

372
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
I could come up with an excuse

373
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,700
to transfer him away.

374
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,540
That won't be necessary.

375
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,060
I've talked to Mr. He.

376
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,180
It wouldn't be easy for
Luo Jiang to get the contract

from Mr. He.

378

00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,020
Hello?

384
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:20,820
Mr. Fu.

385
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,740
The Chinese female doctor
I mentioned to you the other day

386
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,540
moved into Fu Yunshen's house.

387
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,500
Run a background check on her.

388
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,460
Yes.

389
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,380
I'll send you photos of her right away.

390
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,340
Did he leave?

391
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,460
Fu Yunshen?

392
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,580
He hasn't left.

393
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,860
Keep watching.

394
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:04,780
Xizhou.

395
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,260
What brings you here?

396
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,780
To pick you up after work.

397
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,900
I found a great restaurant.

398
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,300
Treat me to dinner.

399
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,450
No.

400
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,700
I have work to finish.

401
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,780
Another time.

402
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,500
Not this again.

403
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,140
You've been working overtime
and having meetings.

404
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,780
We haven't gone on a date for long.

405
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,460
I wonder if I'm still in a relationship.

406
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:31,780
How about this?

407
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,060
I have a day off next Sunday.

408
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,290
Really?

409
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,900
We can go swimming in the morning.

410
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,860
Then, we can watch a movie
and go shopping in the afternoon.

411
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,460
At night...

412
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,700
What's wrong?

413
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,740
Gastric pain?

414
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,220
Did you skip your meals again?

415
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,540
It's all right. I took my medicine.

416
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,740
We should go to a hospital.

417
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,060
Never mind.

418
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,740
No.

419
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,940
You need a break now.

420
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,260
Your dark circles
can almost outshine pandas'.

421
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,170
Lie down.

422
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,700
- What?
- Lie down.

423
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,860
Why am I lying down?

424
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,900
Take a deep breath.

425
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,380
Relax.

426
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,380
Close your eyes.

427
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,420
Your body is heavy.

428
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,900
You need a good sleep.

429
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:58,860
Xizhou?

430
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:01,900
Xizhou?

431
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,540
He fell asleep so quickly.

432
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,060
Dad, Xizhou, the food is ready.

433
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,780
Coming.

434
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,940
Mr. Wang is cunning.

435
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,820
He won't make a stance
until the final moment.

436
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,580
I think

437
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,060
I should ask Mr. Wang out
for a game of golf.

438
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,540
You should join us.

439
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,420
Sure.

440
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,380
Okay, all the dishes are ready.

441
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,570
This is the last.

442
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,820
We're having a feast here.

443
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,300
Xizhou.

444
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,980
Here, have a prawn.

445
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,740
I bought them this morning.

446
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,780
They are fresh.

447
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,060
Thank you, Madam.

448
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,260
You love the wings.

449
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,580
Your favorite, the ribs.

450
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,460
Xizhou.

451
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,620
You two have been engaged
for over a year.

452
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,900
When are you getting married?

453
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,540
Mom.

454
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,140
Xizhou and I have discussed this.

455
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,220
He is still mourning the passing
of his mother.

456
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,380
We can't hold a wedding.

457
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,620
Sir,

458
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:10,860
Madam,

459
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,940
if I can have your permission,

460
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,820
I'd like to get registered with Ruanruan.

461
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,740
We'll hold the wedding three years later.

462
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,180
Really?

463
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,060
I don't think it's adequate.

464
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,100
It's too casual.

465
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,420
Xizhou.

466
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,020
I'd love to leave Ruanruan in your care,

467
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,180
but she is the only child we have.

468
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,500
My wife and I

469
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,380
would like for Ruanruan
to have a grand wedding.

470
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,140
Let's wait.

471
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,660
Dad, Mom.

472
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,260
I never planned to have a wedding.

473
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,340
I attended

474
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,300
a friend's wedding recently.

475
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,020
The process was so cumbersome.

476
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,220
It was exhausting.

477
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,100
And the parents were just as tired.

478
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,420
I don't want to trouble you.

479
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,420
Ruanruan,

480
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,260
your dad and I don't mind it.

481
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,340
Mom,

482
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,140
you've always told me

483
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,580
what matters in a marriage

484
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,260
is the one next to me.

485
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,460
I am certain

486
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,100
Xizhou is the right one.

487
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,700
Ruanruan.

488
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,260
Mom,

489
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,100
