00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:47,780
♪So don't reach for a future wound
at this moment♪

377
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,060
♪Just stay where you are♪

378
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,740
Doctor.

379
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,420
How long does my son have to stay
in the ICU?

380
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,780
He has turned the corner.

381
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,020
Will he face any dangers?

382
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,860
The patient's spleen has been removed,

383
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,780
which will reduce his immune system.

384
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,420
So,

385
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,900
he mustn't have any health problems.

386
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,860
Even common colds

387
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,140
must be handled carefully.

388
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,100
All right.

389
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,740
Thank you so much.

390
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,500
Hello.

391
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,940
How's it coming along?

392
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,620
Pretty well.

393
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,140
I've met with the shareholders.

394
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,620
They showed interest in it.

395
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,660
However,

396
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,900
I didn't get to meet with Zhou Xianren.

397
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,780
You can try again.

398
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,300
I suppose he has lost confidence

399
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,700
in Fu Yunshen as of now.

400
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,740
Okay.

401
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,380
The timing is just perfect.

402
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,980
You've chucked Jiang Shuning
out of the company.

403
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,380
What about Gu Changlin?

404
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,660
Should I talk to him?

405
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,620
Not for now.

406
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:11,940
Okay.

407
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,860
But you have to handle this yourself.

408
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,100
There's one more thing

409
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,460
I need to remind you.

410
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,900
You must lie low.

411
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,860
The market wouldn't wish
to see any news about you.

412
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,060
I know.

413
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,380
I need to use the restroom.

414
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:43,940
Why are you here?

415
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,420
Mr. Fu.

416
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,340
Mr. Fu Jr. is in the ICU now.

417
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,700
(We're blood brothers.)

418
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,860
(I don't care about
what stance we're in.)

419
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,220
I really

420
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,740
miss our childhood time.

421
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,500
That's the exact opposite of me.

422
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,540
I don't miss it at all.

423
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,620
Well...

424
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,260
Do you want
to turn against your brother?

425
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,780
Zhizhi said

426
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,220
Yunshen's vitals

427
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,700
have become normal.

428
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
He'll be transferred to the general ward

429
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,140
very soon.

430
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,820
Don't worry.

431
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,860
He has the best medical service here.

432
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,220
There's nothing I'll be worried about.

433
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,060
Seeing you here to visit Yunshen,

434
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,140
I'm really happy.

435
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,500
It's late now.

436
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,820
I'll send you home.

437
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,540
Let go of me!

438
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,740
What's wrong with you?

439
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:12,940
Get off me!

440
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,580
Yunshen!

441
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,540
Yunshen!

442
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,740
Hello, this is the Department
of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

443
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:38,780
Hello.

444
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,500
This is Songjiang District
Police Station.

445
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,820
Is this Ms. Zhu Jiu?

446
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,180
Yes, I am.

447
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,260
Meng Zhenghui has been arrested

448
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,980
and Zhou Meiyun is being interrogated

449
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,940
on suspicion of abetting defamation.

450
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,060
We need the signature

451
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,060
of the party involved.

452
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,260
Okay.

453
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,140
I'll send my lawyer over.

454
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,100
All right. See you.

455
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:57,780
See you.

456
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,920
[One month later]

457
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,860
Hello, this is the Department
of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

458
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,020
Fu Yunshen is awake.

459
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,020
Okay, got it.

460
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,140
Yunshen.

461
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,300
How do you feel now?

462
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
Does it hurt?

463
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,860
I wish I could suffer this for you.

464
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:57,980
Mom.

465
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,180
I'm fine.

466
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,380
Grandpa.

467
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,940
Why are you all here?

468
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,260
Where's Zhu Jiu?

469
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,340
How's she now?

470
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,100
Brat.

471
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,540
The thing first you asked is Zhu Jiu

472
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,660
right after you wake up.

473
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,100
You didn't even call me.

474
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,220
Chen Le.

475
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,580
Why did you tell Grandpa about this?

476
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,260
It was you, right?

477
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,780
Do you want to get canned?

478
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,140
You can retire tomorrow.

479
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,860
It's not that, Boss.

480
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,300
You've wronged me.

481
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,300
It wasn't me.

482
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,140
It was me.

483
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,140
I want Grandpa to know

484
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,140
who did this to you.

485
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,700
Enough said.

486
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,860
No one would want this to happen.

487
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,100
Grandpa.

488
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,300
I'm a hero,

489
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,500
just like you.

490
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,580
Hero? Train your body.

491
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,500
Back in my days...

492
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,500
Dad.

493
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,580
Well, I'll stop here.

494
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,780
Let's leave.

495
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,980
He needs rest.

496
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,140
Yunshen.

497
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,060
Thanks to Zhizhi,

498
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,700
she took care of you last night.

499
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,260
Zhizhi.

500
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,700
I have to trouble you today too.

501
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,820
All right.

502
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,380
Mom, there's no need for that.

503
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,820
We have

504
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,180
nurses here.

505
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,740
There's no need to trouble Zhizhi.

506
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,540
Nurses wouldn't be as considerate

507
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,660
as Zhizhi.

508
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,180
Madam Jiang.

509
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,060
It's fine.

510
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,380
Yunshen needs rest.

511
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,980
I'll inform the nurses later.

512
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,860
It's fine.

513
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,100
No.

514
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,780
They need to look after
so many patients.

515
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,900
They wouldn't be considerate.

516
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,260
Grandpa.

517
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,940
Enough said, let's go.

518
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,820
He needs rest.

519
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,180
I'm tired now.

520
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,380
All right.

521
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Well, get more rest.

522
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,260
Let's go.

523
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,220
I'll come again.

524
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,180
Let's go.

525
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,020
Take care of him.

526
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,620
I will, Ms. Jiang.

527
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,340
Call me if anything happens.

528
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:41,860
Okay.

529
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,820
Bye-bye, Grandpa.

530
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:44,900
Stay here.

531
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,700
I'll see your grandpa off.

532
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,980
No need, just stay here.

533
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
I'll send them off and go out
to buy something for you.

534
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,700
Don't go. I want to talk to you.

535
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,140
Tell me

536
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,540
what you want to eat.

537
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,620
You're done.

538
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,300
Let me in.

539
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,540
Zhizhi.

540
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,060
Take care of Yunshen.

541
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,300
He needs you.

542
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:19,900
Yunshen's awake.

543
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,020
I want to go in.

544
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,020
Don't let her in.

545
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:25,940
Mrs. Fu.

546
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,300
Madam Jiang.

547
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:32,900
Mrs. Fu.

548
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,700
Whether or not you like me,

549
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,020
you have to accept the truth

550
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,940
that I'm Fu Yunshen's girlfriend.

551
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,900
I have the right and responsibility
to visit him.

552
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,220
Girlfriend?

553
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,100
Are you sure?

554
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,180
Yunshen has suffered so much
because of you.

555
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,100
It's not up to you to decide.

556
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:55,970
Your grandmother

557
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,820
is in the Department
of Hepatobiliary Surgery, right?

558
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,180
She suffers from liver cancer.

559
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,900
It's very serious, isn't it?

560
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,340
Mrs. Fu.

561
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,420
I'm well aware

562
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,260
of what's going on
behind Meng's lawsuit.

563
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,860
Yunshen's assault
has something to do with you.

564
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,660
Do you really think

565
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,100
everything will go your way?

566
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,260
You'll see.

567
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,580
Who are you?

568
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,500
What are you doing?

569
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,260
Fu Xizhou sued my company

570
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,660
for a claim of twenty million.

571
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,460
Do you know about this?

572
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,060
I'm not going to talk about

573
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,300
that you fooled me before.

574
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,300
Every company gathered

575
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,820
to come up with solutions

576
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,980
when something happened.

577
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,940
However, Mr. Fu

578
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,580
is really intriguing.

579
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,780
He cooped himself at home.

580
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,580
Besides, he had the court

581
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,500
to send me a summons to tackle me.

582
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,060
- No.
- Apparently, he wanted to corner you

583
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,620
and make me his scapegoat?

584
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,380
Mr. Cheng.

585
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,780
I have no idea what he's up to.

586
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,180
I've left Lingtian.

587
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,340
Fine.

588
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,660
I don't want to make things difficult
for you.

589
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,380
As long as you took the half
of the claim.

590
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:29,980
No.

591
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,340
Are you kidding me?

592
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,900
I don't have the money.

593
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,660
You can seek your aunt, Jiang Shuning.

594
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,260
She can back you up, right?

595
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,420
Go and convince her

596
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,580
like how you convinced me then.

597
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,540
Perhaps I can write an IOU first.

598
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,740
Consider that I owe you.

599
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,220
I'll pay you back slowly.

600
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,860
Pay me back slowly?

601
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,900
Are you planning

602
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,660
to pay me back after I die?

603
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,340
Don't you worry.

604
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,420
I'll bring you along before my death.

605
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,780
By the way,

606
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,740
your wife, who works as a model,
as well.

607
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,380
You told me

608
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,100
that she's pregnant, right?

609
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,300
I'm telling you,

610
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,260
don't do anything ridiculous.

611
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,220
If you dare harm her,

612
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,580
I won't let you off! I'm telling you!

613
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,500
Very good!

614
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,220
As long as you feel threatened.

615
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,100
Go!

616
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,820
You're awake?

617
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,940
Why are you

618
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,140
in this uniform?

619
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,780
I used my wit

620
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,100
to get in here.

621
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,090
Stay still.

622
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,420
Fu Yunshen.

623
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,180
You're not a formidable wall.

624
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,700
Why did you do that?

625
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,540
My injury isn't fatal.

626
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,020
Don't worry.

627
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,140
I'm sorry.

628
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,900
You're injured

629
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,700
because of me.

630
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,700
Don't blame yourself.

631
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,220
I would save anyone

632
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
who's in danger

633
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,380
when I see them on some random street.

634
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,500
Besides,

635
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,700
you're my girlfriend.

636
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,140
Does it hurt?

637
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,100
Yes, very much so.

638
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,260
Well, what do I do now?

639
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,260
Are you not coming over?

640
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,540
I don't feel any pain now.

641
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,740
Really?

642
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,980
The IV drip kit is prepared.

643
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,500
Why are you still here?

644
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,420
Who let you in?

645
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,100
We're wondering

646
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,060
what took her so long.

647
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,260
Can't you see I'm watching drama?

648
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,820
Do you want to join me?

649
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,140
No.

650
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,980
Leave the room, then.

651
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,460
That was scary.

652
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,580
Put your arm down.

653
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,420
Okay.

654
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:02,980
Yunshen.

655
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,020
Don't you think

656
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,660
we're having

657
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,380
a secret date here?

658
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,900
What nonsense

659
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,820
are you thinking about, huh?

660
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,340
Nothing.

661
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,220
Secret date my foot.

662
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,420
