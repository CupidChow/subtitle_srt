00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,550
are you all right?

25
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,350
Have you been eating properly?

Have you been sleeping well?

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,350
I'm worried about you.

Can you come out, please?

I can't believe

What happened to Fu Yunshen?

34
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,590
I only know
that he had a car accident a year ago.

00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,150
I don't know the details.

36
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,590
Isn't he your cousin?

37
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,270
A distant cousin.

38
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,990
His grandfather and my grandmother
are cousins.

39
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,830
My grandmother

40
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,110

41

Get to the point.

45
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,190
The point

46
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,430
is our families aren't that close.

47
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,150
It was only a month ago

48
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,710
that his grandfather
suddenly called my grandmother,

49
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,510
asking her to recommend a doctor.

50
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,830

after he said Yunshen was coming here

51
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,910
to receive treatment.

to find the eighth doctor.

I'll cut to the chase.

63

I want to know

64
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,510
what Fu Yunshen went through
in the past year.

65
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,030
So you know everything.

That's great.

I'm so relieved

71
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,150
that he's under your care.

72
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,990
But I'm going to resign.

73
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,430
Resign?

74
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,710
Why?

75
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,470
What happened to him in the past year?

76
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,910
I can't tell you.

77
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,950
I promised him.

00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,590
All right. Goodbye.

83
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,750
I'm really worried about him.

84
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,510
But he refuses to see me

85
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,110
or his family.

86
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,030

how cold winters in Heidelberg are.

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,430
It's no place for a patient.

89
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,070
But the reason he chose to stay there

90
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,550
was because you were there.

91
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,590
Dr. Zhu,

92
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,430
please help him.

93
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,150
You're wrong.

94
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,390
He doesn't want to see me.

95
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,710
No, that's not true.

96
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,590
He's just not ready to see you.

97
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,510
I know he has an awful temper.

98
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,230
Sometimes, he can't even be reasoned with.

99
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,070
Sometimes, he makes you so angry

100
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,390
that you want to beat him up.

101
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,630
But there's a reason

102
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,310
for all of this.

103
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,950
So tell me the reason. Please.

104
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,550
Dr. Zhu,

105
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,990
please don't
make things difficult for me.

106
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,350
I can't tell you.

107
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,270
Chen Le,

108
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,750
you know my character.

109
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,230
I hate ambiguity.

110
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,830
He suddenly disappeared

111
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,150
and appeared out of nowhere.

112
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,310
No matter what he's been through,

113
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,710
I'm willing to be there for him.

114
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,110
But he doesn't even
give me an explanation.

115
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,110
I can't pretend

116
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,950
like none of this ever happened.

117
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,310
All right. That's all I have to say.

118
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,310
Goodbye.

119
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,390

Hello?

121
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,030
(Dr. Zhu did ask me.)

122
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,990
The ruse failed.

123
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,910
Dr. Zhu is resigning.

124
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,430
Well, think of something!

125
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,830
I mean,

126
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,110
can't you give her something?

127
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,030
Maybe treat her to a meal?

128
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,750
You're lucky you aren't
in front of me right now.

129
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,190
Fine.

130
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,270
Then, tell me what do I do now.

131
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,350
She wants to know the reason.

132
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,870
Just tell her everything.

133
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,550
No.

134
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,790
I promised Mr. Fu.

135
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,750
I can't tell her.

136
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,790
This is as far as I can help you.

137
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,830
Figure out the rest on your own.

138
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,870
I'm going to get my beauty sleep.

If you don't want
to eat Miss Tao's cooking,

tell me what you want.

I'll go out and get whatever you want.

What do you want to eat?

156
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,950
Why don't I give Dr. Zhu a call

157
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,150

Sorry. Sorry...

This is really good, Dr. Ji.

Easy there.

186
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,790
Sit here.

187

- Give me two more...
- All right.

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,430
- I can handle five more...

00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,740
They're scary.

380
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,260
It's okay.

381
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,180
I'll handle it.

382
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,500
I'll help you!

383
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,420
Here. Take your medicine.

384
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,980
Who let you in?

385
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,980
You've been fired.

386
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,660
You smell like disinfectant.

387
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,540
I can't stand it.

388
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,580
It smells terrible.

389
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,620
Too cold.

390
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,820
Drink your medicine.

391
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,700
Too hot.

392
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,740
Okay.

393
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,460
It has a proper temperature now.

394
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,540
If it's too hot...

395
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,420
I'll do it myself.

396
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,340
I'll give you a reward
after you finish it.

397
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,980
You don't live here,

398
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,460
and Yunshen isn't here anymore.

399
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,220
No one

400
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,180
can eat with me.

401
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,300
All alone.

402
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,220
How boring is that?

403
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,340
Well, Grandpa,

404
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,620
I'll come home

405
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,220
and eat with you more often.

406
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,420
That's more like it.

407
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,140
Oh, right.

408
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,220
Have you been in touch with your brother?

409
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,940
Isn't he not answering anyone's calls?

410
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,540
Oh, that boy...

411
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:24,940
That reminds me.

412
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,820
The promotion to Vice President I told you

413
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,100
will need to be postponed.

414
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,860
Did something come up?

415
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,340
The board couldn't reach an agreement.

416
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,980
Zhou and Gu

417
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,260
almost got into a fight over this.

418
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,180
Zhou

419
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,540
even brought up Perdo.

420
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,580
He said the project

421
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,460
has hardly made any progress in a year.

422
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,740
He wants accountability.

423
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,300
We're working hard

424
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,780
to address the R&D issues,

425
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,780
but the Finance Department
has been blocking us

426
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,100
at every turn with the budget.

427
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,180
Your aunt mentioned this to me as well.

428
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,780
She didn't approve it
because she found the budget unreasonable.

429
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,420
I've already made adjustments
to the budget,

430
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,980
but the line she set is impossible.

431
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,420
Both of you have valid arguments.

432
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:18,940
Oh, right.

433
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,580
How are things going in Singapore?

434
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,980
It has just been launched.

435
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,260
Things are challenging,

436
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,980
but I'll overcome them.

437
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,300
The beginning is always the hardest.

438
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,540
As long

439
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,540
as you can secure that deal in Singapore,

440
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,100
those opposing voices
will not be a threat.

441
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,700
I'll do my best, Grandpa.

442
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,380
I believe in you.

443
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,340
Come. Let's eat.

444
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,700
Your medicine is ready. Drink it.

445
00:28:59,300 --> 00:28:59,740
Here.

446
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,660
It's a little hot.

447
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,020
Do you not understand me?

448
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,260
You've been fired.

449
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,940
Leo already paid me.

450
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,580
Three months.

451
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,340
No refunds.

452
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,100
You don't have to return the money.

453
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,980
I'm not a beggar.

454
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,060
I'm going to call the police
if you don't leave.

455
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,620
Unfortunately for you, Leo told me

456
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,340
he has a share of this place, too,

457
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,260
and I can come and go as I please.

458
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,580

Thanks.

506
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,020
Did you stay up late?

507
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,140
I don't remember
you having the night shift last night.

508
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,300
You're right.

509
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,860
I stayed up late to do some research.

510
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,660
You're diligent.

511
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,900
What are you reading?

512
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,500
This.

513
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,340
This is related to neurology, right?

514
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,460
Why are you reading this?

515
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,980
I have a friend

516
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,780
who was in a car accident
and hurt his nerves.

00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,940
and see if I can help him.

521
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,180

522
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,620

00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,820
Let me know if you need anything.

527
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,820
I actually do have a favor to ask of you.

528
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,140
Do you know a neurologist?

529
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,100
Coincidentally,

530
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,300
I happen to know Stephen,

531
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,460
the head of neurology.

532
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,460
That's great!

533
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,700
Can you introduce us?

534
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,100
I have lots of questions for him.

535
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,140
No problem.

536
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,580

Linda,

540
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,340
how's my son been these two days?

541
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,420
I've been preparing meals
according to the recipe you sent me.

542
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,500
Mr. Fu's appetite has improved a lot.

543
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,180
But

544
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,580
he still refuses to go outside.

545
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,260
Keep up the good work on his diet.

546
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,220
Of course.

547
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,220
Keep me posted if anything happens.

548
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,420
Yes.

549
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,020
Yunshen,

550
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,620
you haven't eaten anything for two days.

551
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,180
Here. Eat something.

552
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,940
I found you
the best rehabilitation specialist.

553
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,460
They'll be here this afternoon.

554
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,460
Trust me.

555
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,460
We will cure you.

556
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,020
The doctor says

557
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,860
you have to be positive

558
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,620
and cooperative.

559
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,860
Eat something.

560
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:21,820
Here.

561
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,700
Open.

562
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,780
Come on.

563
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,300
Open your mouth!

564
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,860
Open your mouth!

565
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,700
Why won't you open your mouth?

566
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,380
What do you want to do?

567
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,900
Are you just going to rot away in bed?

568
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,380
I'm sorry...

569
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,180
I was just too worried about you.

570
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:12,940
Yunshen.

571
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,060
Think about your mother.

572
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,380
You're all I have left.

573
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,820
If you go on like this...

574
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,900
It's meaningless

575
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,500
for me to go on...

576
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,540
Please eat something.

577
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,250
[Tianfei Palace]

578
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:02,450
[I wish Yunshen health and peace.
Zhou Zhizhi.]

579
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,100
Hello? Madam Jiang?

580
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,980
Sorry, Madam Jiang.

581
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,740
- Zhizhi.
- I had to work overtime.

582
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,220
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

583
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,060
I specifically found a place
near your workplace.

584
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,220
Sit.

585
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,260
You've lost weight.

586
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,260
Have a seat.

587
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,460
This is for you.

588
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,460
Thank you, Madam Jiang.

589
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,660
Your complexion doesn't look the best.

590
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,820
I heard from your mother
that you've been working late nights.

591
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,900
A girl shouldn't stay up late often.

592
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,540
We've been quite busy recently.

593
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,780
So...

594
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,780
Let's eat.

595
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,860
Zhizhi,

596
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,340
being a doctor is too exhausting.

597
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,220
How about this?

598
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,580
Why don't you
join our company's R&D department?

599
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:22,700
Madam Jiang,

600
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,740
I appreciate that.

601
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,260
But, my specialization
doesn't align with Lingtian.

602
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,780
You can learn.

603
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,580
You're still young.

604
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,540
Yunshen isn't around right now.

605
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,660
It'd be good if you helped him
look after the department.

606
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,140
Yunshen...

607
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,180
How has he been?

608
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,740
You haven't contacted him?

609
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,380
I called him,

610
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,140
but he never answered.

611
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,620
He never replied
to my messages on WeChat, either.

612
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,180
