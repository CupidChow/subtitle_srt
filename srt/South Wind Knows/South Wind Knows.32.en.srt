I'll tell you the truth now.

131
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,790
It's because I'm scared.

132
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,670

134
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,590

about a man named Baba Ayob

176
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,510
who had five kids.

177
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,910
Among them,

178
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,430
his favorite is his youngest son.

179
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,790
One day,

180
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,750
the Demon King came to their village.

181
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,510
When he knocks on the door of a family,

182
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,590
the family will have to
devote a child to him.

183
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,270
If they refuse to do so,

184
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,230
the Demon will take all of their children.

185
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,110
Turns out,

186
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,590
Ayob became the unlucky one.

187
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,550
Then?

188
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,870
He and his wife didn't sleep
for a whole night.

189
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,350
When it was nearly dawn,

190
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,790
they had to make a decision.

191
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,470
In the end,

192
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,470
they decided to draw lots.

193
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,390
And their youngest son was the one.

194
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,430
When the day broke,

195
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,230
the Demon came

196
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,110
and took their favorite little son.

197
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,710
Zhu Jiu,

198
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,030
we have to face many choices in our lives.

199
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,710
It’s not like an exam
with a standard answer to each question.

200
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,590
Whether we choose A or B,

201
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,190
we may both regret it and blame ourselves.

202
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,670
But the truth is,

203
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,910
we simply made

204
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,910
the hardest choice at that moment.

205
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,870
Finish the milk.

206
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,190
Go to bed early.

207
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,150
Boss,

208
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,430
try these ribs.

209
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,430
They're superb.

210
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,150
And this chicken.

211
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,430
They do taste great.

212
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,190
What?

213
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,990
You don't like it?

214
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,340
Tell me what you feel like eating.

215
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,510
I'll go buy some for you.

216
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,860
I want alcohol.

217
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,910
That won't do.

218
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,710
Ms. Jiang will kill me if she finds out.

219
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,310
Besides,

220
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,710
if you drown your sorrows
after breaking up,

221
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,910
it'll not only hurt your stomach,

222
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,380
but also won't help with your recovery.

223
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,310
Boss,

224
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,470
you have to know

225
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,230
how to adjust your plan
when occasions occur.

226
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,910
You can just tell Ms. Jiang
that you agreed, for now.

227
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,710
When Doctor Zhu's Grandma

228
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,270
has a successful operation,

229
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,590
you can be together
with Miss Zhu again, right?

230
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,910
Ms. Jiang

231
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,910
can't ask her
to give that liver back, can she?

232
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,790
Don't you think so?

233
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,150
Why should I believe you?

234
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,830
Why haven't I learnt any lesson?

235
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,230
Is this a bad idea?

236
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,870
I think it's brilliant.

237
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,150
Easy to understand and easy to execute.

238
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,870
Well, as a last resort,

239
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,870
just elope with Doctor Zhu.

240
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,670
Elope

241
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,270
to...

242
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,390
To Naotao.

243
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,630
Where you first met each other.

244
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,310
That would be so romantic.

245
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,310
Don't you think?

246
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,670
Then you come back five or six years later

247
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,510
with a chubby baby.

248
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,630
What's done is done.

249
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,350
What else can Ms. Jiang do?

250
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,310
Right?

251
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,550
How about having a pigeon pair?

252
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,510
That'll do.

253
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,830
Boss,

254
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,590
your plan is better than mine.

255
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,190
Go away.

256
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,590
Don't disturb me while I'm reading.

257
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,590
I'm leaving for real.

258
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,550
What?

259
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,710
Are these not to your liking?

260
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,710
I'm not hungry.

261
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,830
Just eat a little more.

262
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,270
You didn't have much for breakfast.

263
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,230
Or, if there's anything you want to eat,

264
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,350
I'll buy some for you.

265
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,150
Please forgive me.

266
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,470
I kind of feel like having the dumplings
made by Yunshen.

267
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,150
Don't tell him.

268
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,830
He's too busy.

269
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,590
Okay.

270
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,430
When he comes back from the business trip,

271
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,030
I'll ask him to make some for you, okay?

272
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,790
Then I won't be able to see him

273
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,670
before this operation.

274
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,710
Should I give him a call

275
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,870
and ask if he can make it back?

276
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,630
No.

277
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,470
Just leave him be.

278
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,910
It's fine if I can't see him.

279
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,230
He's really too busy.

280
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,750
You're getting thinner again.

281
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,310
I'm not losing any weight.

282
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:39,910
Eat.

283
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,950
Yunshen likes you to be plumper.

284
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,510
Take your time.

285
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,830
Have meals regularly

286
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,430
to gain more weight.

287
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,030
It's good for your health.

288
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,350
Have some vegetables too.

289
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,150
Doctor Zhu.

290
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,150
Doctor Zhu?

291
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,270
The patient has been discharged.

292
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,230
Discharged? When?

293
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,030
Yesterday.

294
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,590
It's not the time for him
to be discharged, is it?

295
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,110
That's right.

296
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,550
But he insisted.

297
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:42,910
Alright.

298
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:43,870
Thanks.

299
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,150
(Then I won't be able to see him)

300
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,990
(before this operation.)

301
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,150
(Should I give him a call)

302
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,390
(and ask if he can make it back?)

303
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,950
(Just leave him be.)

304
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,430
(It's fine if I can't see him.)

305
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,670
Boss,

306
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,790
The latest R&D data

307
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,750
and the minutes are all here.

308
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,670
Oh,

309
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,870
Leo sent me the latest documents

310
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,190
about Danmin Disease.

311
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:29,950
Please have a look.

312
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,390
Got it. Just put them here.

313
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,190
Okay.

314
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,630
Why haven't you left?

315
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,550
I'm not leaving.

316
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,630
I gotta keep you company.

317
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,790
You'd be so lonely

318
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,230
if you read these alone, right?

319
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,150
And...

320
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,830
Besides,

321
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,070
if you have any questions,

322
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,230
you can ask me anytime.

323
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,390
[Little Bunny]
(Can we meet?)

324
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,830
(It's about Granny.)

325
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:34,750
Speak.

326
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,870
Boss,

327
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,830
you've just recovered.

328
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,350
You have to
have some more rest, right?

329
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,750
You can't work too hard.

330
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,350
[Little Bunny]
(I'm outside your house.)

331
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,620
[Little Bunny]

332
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,510
Boss,

333
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,710
the phone.

334
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,150
Boss,

335
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,310
she's already outside,

336
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,310
standing for quite a while.

337
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,270
I think you should go see her.

338
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,070
How's your physical condition?
Everything good?

339
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,390
Have you been eating properly?

340
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,870
Have you been sleeping properly?

341
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,310
Have you been missing me?

342
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,390
What's up with Granny?

343
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,270
She's having the operation tomorrow.

344
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,870
That's good.

345
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,430
Yunshen,

346
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,870
I'm sorry.

347
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,590
And thank you.

348
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,870
For what?

349
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,750
For everything you did.

350
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,470
I'd like to

351
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,150
ask you for a last favor.

352
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,030
I'm listening.

353
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,790
Granny's operation is tomorrow.

354
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,070
Can you send her into the operating room

355
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,350
together with me?

356
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:35,590
I'm sorry.

357
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,790
Yunshen,

358
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,590
Granny wanted to see you
before the operation.

359
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,590
She told me several times already.

360
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,620
I'm begging you.

361
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,630
