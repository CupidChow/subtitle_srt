(Did you instigate them?)

565
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,380
(Don't talk nonsense.)

566
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,580
(That has nothing to do with me.)

567
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,060
(I just introduced a lawyer to them.)

568
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,220
(I feel sorry for them
for losing their child.)

569
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,380
(I help them fight for their rights)

570
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,620
(and seek justice.
What's wrong with that?)

571
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,170
[Shen, Yunshen]

572
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,180
Grandpa,

573
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,540
you wanted to see me?

574
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,940
I heard that Redstone Investments

575
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,820
is going to acquire Lingtian.

576
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,700
Do you know about that?

577
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,780
Come on,

578
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,900
have a seat.

579
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,580
I just found out about that.

580
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,700
But I think it's a diversion.

581
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,220
What makes you say so?

582
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,220
Logically speaking,

583
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,970
investment firms should know
that our family

584
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,660
has absolute control over Lingtian

585
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,460
when they do their preliminary research.

586
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,100
I've asked around

587
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,980
and found out
that Redstone is also in contact

588
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,300
with other pharmaceutical executives,

589
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,940
so we may not be their target.

590
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,420
So you're saying

591
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,140
they're using false pretenses
to confuse others

592
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,500
when, in fact, they have other plans?

593
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,460
Grandpa,

594
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,180
that's just my assumption.

595
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,900
You're an experienced businessman.

596
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,820
Don't investment firms do that
all the time?

597
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,620
The acquisition of Company A
is preceded by a deliberate announcement

598
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,180
of the acquisition of Company B
in order to lower the price.

599
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,580
There is such an approach.

600
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,100
Grandpa,

601
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,460
don't worry.

602
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,700
As long as we work together as a family,

603
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,500
Lingtian will be fine.

604
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,340
Your mom's the one who initiated this?

605
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,380
And Yunshen's mom.

606
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,220
Ms. Jiang is involved?

607
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,020
Yes.

608
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,500
What are you going to do?

609
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,100
When I first

610
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,340
found out she was involved in a lawsuit,

611
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,660
I gloated a little bit.

612
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,290
I wanted to

613
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,700
listen to my mom

614
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,220
by feigning ignorance

615
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,620
and watching her get ruined.

616
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,740
But I realized I couldn't.

617
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,820
I've tried to delete the recording
so many times.

618
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,380
I'm too troubled to sleep.

619
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,100
But I knew

620
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,620
that if I did it,

621
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,820
I'd become the person I hated the most.

622
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,260
Zhizhi.

623
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,940
I'm going to give the recording
to Yunshen.

624
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,860
But she's your mother.

625
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,940
And Yunshen's mother is involved too.

626
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,700
I know.

627
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,740
That's why I'm really sad.

628
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,780
However,

629
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,620
if I were you,

630
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,260
I'd do the same.

631
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,220
Zhizhi,

632
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,180
why didn't you come to my office and talk?

633
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,020
It's fine.

634
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,980
Let's talk here.

635
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,780
Okay.

636
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,060
Yunshen.

637
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,020
There's been some rumors about Dr. Zhu

638
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,540
at the hospital lately.

639
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,020
I don't know if you've heard about them.

640
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,220
Since they're just rumors,

641
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,660
she won't care.

642
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,180
But I think it's not that simple.

643
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,660
(For the past few days, Meng's parents)

644
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,980
(have been coming
to the hospital to make a fuss.)

645
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,460
(Did you instigate them?)

646
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,380
(Don't talk nonsense.)

647
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,580
(That has nothing to do with me.)

648
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,060
(I just introduced a lawyer to them.)

649
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,220
(I feel sorry for them
for losing their child.)

650
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,420
(I help them fight for their rights)

651
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,660
(and seek justice.
What's wrong with that?)

652
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,740
I'm sorry, Yunshen,

653
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,900
for not telling you this sooner.

654
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,620
But it's related to my mom.

655
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,820
Don't be sorry, Zhizhi.

656
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,620
I understand.

657
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,380
Thank you.

658
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,580
It's not easy for you

659
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,660
to let me listen to this.

660
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,620
I know Dr. Zhu is in a difficult position.

661
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,980
I can give you this recording

662
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,820
to prove her innocence if necessary.

663
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,260
I have something else to attend to.

664
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,860
I'm heading back to the hospital now.

665
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,860
Okay, thank you.

666
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:07,940
Bye.

667
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,620
Mr. Wang,

668
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,500
Mr. Fu is here.

669
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,020
Hi, Mr. Fu.

670
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,020
Hi, Mr. Wang.

671
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,060
Please come in.

672
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:29,980
Have a seat.

673
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,690
What kind of case
did you want me to help with?

674
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,980
I'd like to talk to you

675
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,940
about Meng's medical litigation.

676
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,260
Mr. Fu,

677
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,860
are you the defendant's lawyer?

678
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,660
I'm the defendant's family.

679
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,820
So what do you want to talk to me about?

680
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,780
Who is the one who hired you?

681
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,340
The patient's family, of course.

682
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,620
Mr. Wang,

683
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,100
I've already asked around.

684
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,900
You're an expert in medical litigation.

685
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,540
You charge a fortune.

686
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,020
Given Meng's parents' financial situation,

687
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,180
they wouldn't be able
to afford to hire you.

688
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,220
Mr. Fu,

689
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,340
this is my client's privacy.

690
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,660
It's not relevant to this case.

691
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,060
I'm sorry, I can't say anything.

692
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,100
I've got some work to do.

693
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:17,820
Please excuse me.

694
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,460
Mr. Wang,

695
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,220
maybe this is something that I...

696
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,650
[Chen Le]

697
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,060
Boss,

698
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,300
I've got the address of Meng's house.

699
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,340
I've sent it to you on WeChat.

700
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,060
Okay.

701
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,140
Coming.

702
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,700
These are Meng's favorite things.

703
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,100
Dr. Zhu packed them

704
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,500
