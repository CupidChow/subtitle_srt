271
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,150
Are you going to Country M
because of Zhu Jiu?

Yes.

You're being frank to me,

274

but I feel you're as bold as brass.

275
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,750
Why?

276
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,670
Are you really confident in yourself?

277

278
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,270

279

wants to transfer his shares to them,

[Fu Yunshen. Like.]

379
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,620
[Withdraw.]

380
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,670
Zhizhi.

381
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,790
Ruanruan.

382
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,550
What did you come here for at noon?

383
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,270
Eating with you.

384
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,670
Today?

385
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,910
I'm not available today.

386
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,190
I have a surgery to do this afternoon.

387
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,870
I know you're always busy.

388
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,550
Look.

389
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,590
I have brought them.

390
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,630
I made these myself.

391
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,470
All your favorites.

392
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,070
Look.

393
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,670
High protein.

394
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,670
Crude fiber.

395
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,750
Rich nutrition

396
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,590
but low fat.

397
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,270
You're eating instant noodles again.

398
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:42,990
Eat this.

399
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,870
Eat my food.

400
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,910
Miss Gu Ruanruan.

401
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,150
You came this far to me

402
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,350
not only for dining with me, didn't you?

403
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,430
Eat first.

404
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,310
Eat before we talk.

405
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,630
Talk first

406
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,710
before I eat.

407
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,870
I may have to leave Shanghai
for some time.

408
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,790
For traveling?

409
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,670
Where to go?

410
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,870
It may be longer than traveling.

411
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,710
What... what do you mean by that?

412
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,790
Where are you going?

413
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,670
Why didn't you tell me about it?

414
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,950
When did you make the decision?

415
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,150
I decided it just now.

416
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,470
I came to you
as soon as I made my decision.

417
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,670
Do you remember

418
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,230
the Daniel I told you about?

419
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,550
The war photographer,

420
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,390
my college classmate.

421
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:40,790
But

422
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,470
what does this have to do with Daniel?

423
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,510
Is he pursuing you?

424
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,870
No.

425
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,150
Nonsense.

426
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,270
Last time, I've learned a lot from him

427
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,990
about shooting a documentary.

428
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,910
This time, I want to do it on my own.

429
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:55,750
You...

430
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,350
You go alone?

431
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,670
Where to go?

432
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,190
Country M.

433
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,990
Do you remember what I told

434
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,470
about the children there?

435
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,350
Actually I still feel worried

436
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,270
about them since I came back.

437
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,430
I want to go there

438
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,350
to take videos of their lives.

439
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,830
Ruanruan.

440
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,670
The country is now at war.

441
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,630
Diseases are rampant there.

442
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,710
- I'm so...
- All right.

443
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,190
You're trying to scare me again.

444
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,910
No matter what you say this time,

445
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,270
I'm definitely going there.

446
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,990
This is what I want to do.

447
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,950
I can't always live in a shelter,

448
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,470
letting you guys take me as a little girl.

449
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,030
Ruanruan.

450
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,510
Those who put themselves in danger
are little girls.

451
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,270
Grown-ups know how to protect themselves.

452
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,750
Don't worry.

453
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,350
I've really grown up.

454
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,110
Rest assured,

455
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,150
I'll protect myself well.

456
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,630
Have your parents known this?

457
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:52,990
Okay.

458
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,910
I see.

459
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,310
I'll back you up.

460
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,150
When will you go?

461
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,270
Let me know in advance.

462
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,190
We need to have a meal before you go.

463
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,590
Okay.

464
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,470
Zhizhi.

465
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,990
Can you do me another favor?

466
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,910
Could you go to visit Mr. Fu for me?

467
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,510
Ruanruan.

468
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,630
Why don't you go in person?

469
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,150
How do I dare to see him?

470
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,550
Your divorce was not your fault.

471
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,790
The guilty one is Fu Xi...

472
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,910
I don't understand

473
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,710
how it became this.

474
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:42,910
All right.

475
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,950
Forget about it.

476
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,990
How's Mr. Fu now?

477
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,910
He'll wake up, won't he?

478
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,430
He'll wake up.

479
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,550
Ruanruan.

480
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,030
I think

481
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,190
you should go to see Mr. Fu in person.

482
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,350
Mr. Fu is so fond of you.

483
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,390
I believe he wants to see you.

484
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,390
Whatever you want to say,

485
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,910
you should tell him in person.

486
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,270
After all,

487
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,230
you don't know

488
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,950
when you'll come back from there.

489
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:14,830
Okay.

490
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,070
Eat it.

491
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,230
It's getting cold.

492
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,750
Okay.

493
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,270
Let me see if Chef Ruanruan

494
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,790
has improved her cooking.

495
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,310
Taste this.

496
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,750
My new cooking.

497
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,190
Try.

498
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,750
Mr. Fu.

499
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,350
I came to see you.

500
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,550
Sorry.

501
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,550
If grandpa knows you came to see him,

502
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,710
he would be very happy.

503
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,230
Yunshen.

504
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,470
Sorry.

505
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,110
It's not your fault.

506
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,510
It's my fault.

507
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,630
When he told me
he wanted to make an investment abroad

508
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,110
and asked me to sign some documents,

509
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,470
I signed them without a closer look.

510
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:00,710
I thought

511
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,710
I was showing my love and trust to him.

512
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,990
Why was I so stupid?

513
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,030
If I had known his true color,

514
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,230
Mr. Fu wouldn't have been like this.

515
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,230
Ruanruan.

516
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,590
Don't focus on the things

517
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,110
that have happened.

518
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,910
You often say I'm stupid.

519
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,510
Fu Xizhou is more calculating

520
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,510
than the rest of us indeed.

521
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,350
But now,

522
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,430
Mr. Gu has helped me a lot.

523
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,590
I'm very grateful to him.

524
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,230
I know your feelings for Fu Xizhou.

525
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,790
As your friend,

526
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,110
I don't want to force you,

527
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,910
because this is between me and him.

528
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,710
You don't have to be guilty.

529
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,590
After all,

530
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,820
I don't want anyone

531
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,670
to get involved in the storm,

532
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,390
especially grandpa.

533
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,990
I came to say goodbye to Mr. Fu.

534
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,510
I can't do anything

535
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,110
but run away like a deserter.

536
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,590
(Grandpa.)

537
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,030
(Do you really believe)

538
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,830
(I want to be the manager?)

539
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,750
You're wrong.

540
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,270
I'll let Redstone take over Lingtian

541
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,830
and split it apart before selling it.

542
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,550
I'll make Lingtian Pharmaceutical Group

543
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,910
die and be gone forever.

544
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,110
You...

545
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:01,870
Who's there?

546
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,190
I thought someone had sneaked
into Chairman Fu's office.

547
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,550
What are you doing here, Mr. Fu?

548
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,430
I came to get something for Grandpa.

549
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,430
Mr. Fu, don't be worried.

550
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:15,990
Chairman Fu is a good person.

551
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,150
I believe he'll be blessed.

552
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,470
Thank you.

553
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:21,830
You know,

554
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,910
I have worked for Chairman Fu
for many years.

555
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,310
From when he had
his first office room in PuXi

556
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,790
to when he owned this building,

557
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,870
I've been a security guard at Lingtian.

558
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,470
When he was at the most difficult time

559
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,070
and couldn't afford to pay staff,

560
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,750
he even ran around for money.

561
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,350
All right.

562
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,750
You can go now.

563
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,630
Okay.

564
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,470
I'll turn off the light.

565
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:41,870
Okay.

566
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,150
See you tomorrow, Mr. Fu.

567
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,190
(What's that noise?)

568
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,190
(Are you okay?)

569
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,390
I'm fine.

570
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:21,630
(Okay.)

571
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,870
[Looking at the deep sea,
I share your worries.]

572
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,550
[South wind knows my thought,]
(Here's the thing.)

573
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,350
[sending it to Xizhou.]

574
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,350
[At Xizhou in daylight. By mom.]
(I heard)

575
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,470
(your grandpa
won't make it through this time.)

576
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,390
(Is it true?)

577
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,590
The doctor
hasn't given me the notification.

578
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,390
(I got it.)

579
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,150
(Okay.)

580
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,190
(Once the news comes,)

581
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,990
(we'll buy them in bulk
when the market opens.)

582
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,990
(Don't worry about Gu Ruanruan.)

583
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,910
(She's a figurehead now
and can't do anything.)

584
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,190
(Hello?)

585
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:53,990
(Do you hear me?)

586
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,750
(Hello? Xizhou, do you hear me?)

587
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,230
(Hello?)

588
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,030
Hello.

589
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,790
Wait a second.

590
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,790
(Wait?)

591
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,590
(For what?)

592
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,430
(Xizhou, I...)

593
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,390
(I don't get it.)

594
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,350
(What do you mean?)

595
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:15,830
(Don't forget)

596
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,390
(it was you who asked for my help.)

597
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,630
(I've put a lot of money
and effort into it.)

598
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,110
(Destiny brought us here.)

599
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,430
(This is just the perfect time,
my friend.)

600
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,550
I...

601
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,670
I'm not feeling well now.

602
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,630
I'll call you later.

603
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,190
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

604
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,590
You placed the picture there on purpose,

605
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,670
letting me find it

606
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,310
so that I'll be guilty.

607
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,270
Rest assured,

608
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,710
I won't be fooled again.

609
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,110
I won't.
