00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,700
Why did you have to come back?

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,540
Fu Xizhou.

24
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,660
You have really lost your mind

25
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,700
for benefit.

26
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,740
Did you really send someone
to beat up Fu Yunshen?

27
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,300
You've heard everything, right?

28
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,380
Why?

29
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,820
He's your brother.

30
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,220
Is it because of the car accident?

31
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,300
The police already said

32
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,860
it was just an accident.

33
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,860
Accident?

34
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,260
I can't think of any other reason.

35
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,740

if there's any misunderstanding.

There's no need for that.

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,660

112
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,900
You don't say.

113
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,060
You crawled into bed last night

114
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,020
and kicked me.

115
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
I was scared out of my wits.

116
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,180
Since you're making up stories,

117
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,380
I guess you're sober now.

118

Granny isn't awake yet.

119
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,740
You should quickly go.

120
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,500
I don't want to.

121
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,900
I'm your boyfriend.

122
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,900
Why should I sneak around?

123
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,860
Still, you can't stay.

124
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,940
It's bad if Granny finds out.

125
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,460
Hurry!

126
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,020
I'll leave after saying hi to Granny.

127
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,940
No.

128
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,300
But I'm starving now.

129
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,900
I want to eat Granny's wontons.

130
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,260
Okay.

131
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,940
My treat.

132
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,820
Let's go out to eat.

133
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,820
Quickly. Hurry up.

134
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,660
- But I want to have it here.
- Quick!

135
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,420
Keep your voice down. You hear me?

136
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,860
How am I loud talking like this?

137
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,380
You want a beating?

138
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,540
- Just a while more.
- Go.

139
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,340
Zhu Jiu, have you gotten up?

140
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,460
I have something...

141
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,940
Morning, ma'am.

142
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,060

00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,660
Ruanruan.

144
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,660
Something happened again.

145
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,220
What's wrong?

146
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,700
Ms. Ji is in a bad mood again.

147
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,500
She said her installation art
wasn't right.

148
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,860
She wanted it removed right away.

149
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,460
But the exhibition is coming soon.

150
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,660
It's too late to redo it.

151
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,100
Is she at the art gallery now?

152
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,420
Her assistant said
she locked herself in her studio.

153
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,780
She refused to answer her phone too.

154
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,460
Wait for me.

155
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,540
I'm coming right over.

156
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,980
Thanks.

157
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,500
You have a boyfriend now?

158
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,220
Why didn't you tell me

159
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,700
about such a big matter?

160
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,620
What now?

161
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,420
Are you looking down on me?

162
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,220
Of course not.

163
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,980
I was just busy with work.

164
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,340
I didn't get the chance to tell you.

165
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,820
Back then,

166
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,180
your granny insisted on
sending you abroad to study.

167
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,340
I couldn't stop her no matter what.

168
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,260
Look at you now.

169
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,500
I don't know how well you studied.

170
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,380
But I see you are quite good at learning

171
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,900
to be open like foreigners.

172
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,020
You're not even married yet,

173
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,260
but you've let him stay overnight.

174
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,620
I was the one who asked Yunshen to stay.

175
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,300
You...

176
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,980
Mom.

177
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,380
Your wontons are the best.

178
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,660
Yunshen.

179
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,980
There are two bowls of wontons
in the kitchen.

180
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,100
Can you go get them?

181
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,460
Sure, Granny.

182
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,380
Have it first, darling.

183
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,900
Thank you, Granny.

184
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,100
Stop talking nonsense. You're her aunt.

185
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,340
I wasn't talking nonsense.

186
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,340
She's a girl

187
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,220
without a mother.

188
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,420
I should obviously be concerned for her.

189
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,140
Aunt.

190
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,140
I'm not a kid anymore.

191
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,820
I know

192
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,020
what I am doing.

193
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,420
Look at her.

194
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,500
Now that she has grown up,

195
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,940
I'm not allowed to nag at her.

196
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,060
Here it is.

197
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Good.

198
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,820
- For you, Granny.
- Thanks.

199
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,140
Smells delicious.

200
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,140
Fu.

201
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,540
What do you do for a living?

202
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,780
Eat quickly.

203
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,460
The wontons are getting cold.

204
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,940
Mom.

205
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,020
Look.

206
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,300
I can't even ask

207
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,420
what my niece's boyfriend

208
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,340
does for a living.

209
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,780
It's alright, Granny.

210
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,260
Madam.

211
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,580
I work at a pharmaceutical company

212
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,500
in R&D.

213
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,820
Oh, I see.

214
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,460
My husband

215
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,660
bought a lot of shares
in pharmaceutical companies.

216
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,700
Which company do you work for?

217
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,100
I work for Lingtian.

218
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,260
That's a big company.

219
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,060
That's impressive.

220
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,820
Did you pass the test to get in

221
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,060
or pull some strings?

222
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,820
Both.

223
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,540
Right.

224
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,980
See? I told you.

225
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,900
Say,

226
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,660
your parents must be higher-ups, right?

227
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,260
My husband said

228
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,940
shares of Lingtian Pharmaceutical Group

229
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,580
are doing great in the market.

230
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,940
Do you have any insider information

231
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,980
that you can share?

232
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,340
Aunt.

233
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,460
Yunshen works in R&D.

234
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,780
He has no idea about shares.

235
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,460
Don't lie to me.

236
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,300
How can you not know

237
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,580
of any insider information
if you work for the company, right?

238
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,100
Disclosing insider information

239
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,140
is illegal.

240
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,460
Oh, come on.

241
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,940
Stop scaring me.

242
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,860
You two should hurry

243
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,060
or you will be late.

244
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,140
That's right.

245
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,100
Hurry. We're late.

246
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,300
We'll be on our way, then.

247
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,140
Well, then. Madam,

248
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,100
I'll visit you again.

249
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,820
Goodbye.

250
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,060
Okay.

251
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:38,980
Bye, Granny.

252
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,060
I'm off, Granny!

253
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,140
Sorry.

254
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,940
It's okay.

255
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,620
It's just that Granny's wontons
were wasted.

256
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,740
It's okay.

257
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,460
I'll take you to eat
the best-fried dough glutinous rice

258
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,060
in Shanghai.

259
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,100
- Hi, two, please.
- Okay.

260
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,460
Coming right up.

261
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,220
Sure.

262
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,100
Okay, thank you.

263
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,300
Here you go.

264
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,740
Thank you.

265
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,580
Try it.

266
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,340
It's delicious.

267
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,020
I've had this since I was a kid.

268
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,020
Try it.

269
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,020
Is it nice?

270
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,420
Not bad, indeed.

271
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:30,780
Thank you.

272
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,340
Yunshen.

273
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,460
I gave it some thought.

274
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,420
Could there be some misunderstanding
between you and Xizhou?

275
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,500
Why don't you try talking it out
with him again?

276
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,100
Maybe there's no misunderstanding.

277
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,820
I suddenly woke up last night.

278
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,180
I thought long about it calmly.

279
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,900
People don't suddenly change
for no reason.

280
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,500
I'm sure something happened.

281
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,740
I will definitely find out what it is.

282
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,540
Let's go.

283
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,940
Mom, I'm leaving.

284
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,540
Wait.

285
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,940
A friend gave me a box of pastries.

286
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,620
Give it to Yang.

287
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,540
Thanks, Mom.

288
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,660
What is that in your bag?

289
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,860
It's not for me.

290
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,700
I took it for Yang.

291
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,540
Children shouldn't
consume tonics casually.

292
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,060
How about this?

293
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,900
Bring Yang over

294
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,260
this weekend.

295
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,540
I'll take him to Madam Hu
to check his pulse.

296
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,540
Madam Hu never prescribes any tonic
for children.

297
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,980
I think

298
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,380
you should put more effort
into Yang's diet.

299
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,700
He is growing.

300
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,620
Fine, I got it.

301
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,540
I won't take it.

302
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,540
Yang will be going to
junior high school.

303
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,900
I was worried.

304
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,140
Speaking of which,

305
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,860
Mom,

306
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,460
I want to change
Yang's registration here.

307
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,900
The school district here is good.

308
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,500
He can even get into
a key middle school.

309
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,380
Is that okay?

310
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,820
Okay.

311
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,500
When the time comes,

312
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,340
I will move in here with him,

313
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,580
so that I can look after him

314
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,740
and take care of you.

315
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,140
There's only one room in the house.

316
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,060
Yang isn't a little boy anymore.

317
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,580
You can't squeeze into a room with him.

318
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,700
Mom.

319
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,340
I looked up Fu Yunshen on the internet.

320
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,020
He's no ordinary man.

321
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,980
That's why

322
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,580
the fabric he wore for his clothes

323
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,620
was extraordinary.

324
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,660
Did you know?

325
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,820
He's the second young master
of Lingtian Pharmaceutical Group.

326
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,180
Zhu Jiu found herself a rich man.

327
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,820
If she tries harder and marries him,

328
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,700
then we can have her room.

329
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,420
Don't be ridiculous.

330
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,620
Don't think of taking Zhu Jiu's room.

331
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,700
You are

332
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,260
being biased.

333
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,860
You were partial to my brother as a kid.

334
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,300
Now you are partial to his daughter.

335
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,220
You're a fine one to talk.

336
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,620
If you listened to the grownups
back then,

337
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,460
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

338
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,300
Fine.

339
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,220
I didn't listen.

340
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,500
I'm not doing well.

341
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,220
But you don't have to
bring it up all the time.

342
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,700
Watch your step.

343
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,700
Thanks.

344
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:03,860
Mr. Fu.

345
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,100
Professor Yuan is here.

346
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,860
Hello, Professor Yuan.

347
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,980
Hello, Mr. Fu.

348
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,020
Sit.

349
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,660
Thanks.

350
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,260
Allow me to introduce myself.

351
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,070
[Building 19, Lane 284, Jiangsu Road]

352
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,940
Gu Ruanruan.

353
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,620
Even if you have quarreled
with Fu Xizhou,

354
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,060
don't take it out on yourself.

355
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,980
What did you quarrel over this time?

356
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,380
Zhizhi.

357
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,020
Am I really immature and unreliable?

358
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,500
Why are you suddenly asking that?

359
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,300
Xizhou forever thinks of me

360
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,220
as someone
who keeps following him around.

361
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,380
He won't tell me anything.

362
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,340
He never seemed to think of me as a wife

363
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,900
who can share his burden.

364
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,260
Did he hide something from you?

365
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,340
I'm not talking about this time.

366
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,340
I'm talking about a feeling.

367
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,140
Why don't you find a chance

368
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,260
to talk to him about this?

369
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,900
I have.

370
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,460
He refused to open his heart to me.

371
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,020
You know that feeling?

372
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,740
This person
is clearly by your side every day.

373
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,500
But sometimes,

374
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,620
you feel that he's so far away from you.

375
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,620
It seems like

376
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,100
I was never able to reach his heart.

377
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,860
Yunshen.

378
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,260
What brings you here?

379
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,260
There's something I want to tell you.

380
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,540
Go ahead.

381
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,020
I was beaten up one time

382
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,540
when I was in Heidelberg.

383
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,260
Now, someone told me
my brother was behind it.

384
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,500
Yunshen.

385
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,540
I actually heard you two

386
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,780
quarreling that night.

387
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,980
But I'm sure
there is some misunderstanding.

388
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,660
I have asked him.

389
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,340
But he refused to tell me.

390
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,940
Whatever it is,

391
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,860
I apologize to you on Xizhou's behalf.

392
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,540
You don't have to apologize to me.

393
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,100
You had nothing to do with it.

394
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,140
I came here today to tell you

395
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,620
that I will be handing over evidence
to the police.

396
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,180
You're reporting it to the police?

397
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,700
I am.

398
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,180
Don't do this, Yunshen.

399
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,500
He's still your brother no matter what.

400
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,340
Can you not take this to the police?

401
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,740
But he never thought of me
as his brother.

402
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,100
But that's his mother who died.

403
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,780
What does that mean?

404
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,500
The one you tried to avoid

405
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,300
during your car accident

406
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,660
was actually Xizhou's mother.

407
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,460
Why did no one tell me about this?

408
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,700
You were in a bad condition
when you woke up.

409
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,940
Grandpa asked everyone
to keep it from you.

410
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,900
I can't believe it was Ms. Lin.

411
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,820
Yunshen.

412
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,580
You're not to blame for the accident.

413
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,820
Technically,

414
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,020
I know Xizhou
shouldn't be angry with you.

415
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,220
But that was his mother who died.

416
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,740
Can you...

417
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,100
Can you not...

418
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,460
Don't worry.

419
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,740
I wasn't going to the police.

420
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,820
Thank you, Yunshen.

421
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,540
Fu Yunshen.

422
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,500
Did you lie to me?

423
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,660
I'm sorry, Gu Ruanruan.

424
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,740
I was eager to know the truth.

425
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,860
Mr. Fu Jr.

426
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,260
He's really not in.

427
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,900
You're done eating already?

428
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,860
I brought extra food. Have some more.

429
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,500
What did you bring today?

430
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,740
Take a look.

431
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,380
Shanghai Bok Choy.

432
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,060
You're so lucky to have

433
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,900
a grandmother who can cook.

434
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,620
Have some.

435
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,340
- Thank you!
- Thank you, Dr. Zhu!

436
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,940
Today we have a new chief
of our department.

437
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,900
Have any of you seen him?

438
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,860
No.

439
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,340
I heard he returned from abroad.

440
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,740
Apparently, he is young and handsome.

441
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,820
Most importantly, he's still a bachelor.

442
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,220
I can't wait to see him.

443
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,580
Aren't you swooning over him
a bit too much?

444
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,580
Your boyfriend is so handsome.

445
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,300
You would never understand

446
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,140
how single people like us think.

447
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,300
He's indeed quite handsome, isn't he?

448
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,820
Ugh, I've had enough.

449
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,980
Have some more.

450
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,900
I'm full.

451
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,740
I'm full of you showing off your love.

452
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,860
Let's go.

453
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,700
Dr. Zhu!

454
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,780
A patient in the waiting area

455
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,300
is suspected of having an AMI!

456
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,460
I'm coming!

457
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,380
The patient in Ward 14 is having an MI

458
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,460
and needs surgery, stat!

459
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,420
- Come with me.
- Mint.

460
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,780
Dr. Ji?

461
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:17,980
Give me a hand.

462
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,540
Okay.

463
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,660
Xizhou.

464
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,180
Your fencing skill
is getting better and better.

465
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,500
Xizhou.

466
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,180
Can we talk?

467
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,540
Shoot.

468
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,180
I'm sorry.

469
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,140
I just found out

470
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,020
about your mother.

471
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,140
Is that all?

472
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,620
Were you blaming me because of that?

473
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,020
Fine.

474
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,780
Since you want to know,

475
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,100
I will tell you.

476
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,060
Everything I've done

477
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,060
is to gain control of the company.

478
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,260
Xizhou.

479
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,300
I have said this many times.

480
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,420
You know

481
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,580
that I was never interested
in the inheritance.

482
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,060
As long as your mother is around,

483
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,900
you are my biggest threat.

484
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,620
It doesn't matter what my mom thinks.

485
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,340
Once I have made up my mind,

486
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,620
no one can change it.

487
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:53,860
Xizhou.

488
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,700
Trust me.

489
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,060
I only trust myself.

490
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,020
Ruanruan!

491
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,300
Are you hurt? Let me see.

492
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,220
Get up.

493
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,860
Where are you hurt?

494
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,980
I'll call for an emergency.

495
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,660
Is this the emergency center?

496
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,020
Someone here fell off a ladder.

497
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,740
Mr. Fu.

498
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,380
What happened?

499
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,780
She fell off the ladder

500
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,380
while hanging up the poster.

501
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,780
What did the doctor say?

502
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,340
Just a slight concussion,

503
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,180
but nothing serious.

504
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,540
She can leave after some observation.

505
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,820
I'll take you to her.

506
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,740
Okay.

507
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,020
Have some porridge.

508
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:28,820
I'm tired.

509
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,700
I want to sleep.

510
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,020
The doctor said you must eat.

511
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,340
You should listen.

512
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,140
I'm not hungry.

513
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,940
If you don't want porridge,

514
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,860
what about something else?

515
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,140
That night,

516
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,940
I let my emotions get the best of me.

517
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,060
I'm sorry.

518
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,220
You don't have to apologize.

519
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,700
I've calmed down
and thought about it lately.

520
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,860
I wasn't making a fuss.

521
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,340
Spouses should have trust and be honest

522
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,420
with each other.

523
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,220
If two people who share a bed

524
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,580
don't share their minds,

525
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,620
then what's the point of our marriage?

526
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,940
So you think

527
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,780
that spouses should be
completely transparent with each other

528
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,300
and have no secrets.

529
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,580
Is that right?

530
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,940
Don't you agree?

531
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,100
Ruanruan.

532
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,580
Everyone's understanding
and definition of marriage

533
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,820
is different.

534
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,780
We grew up together.

535
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,580
Before we got married,

536
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,500
you knew I was like this.

537
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,900
I don't like confiding in others.

538
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,260
I don't like sharing everything
with others either.

539
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,500
That's different.

540
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,700
Back then, we were friends.

541
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,340
Now, we're husband and wife.

542
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,420
It is different.

543
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,460
But it is hard for people
to make a change.

544
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,820
I can promise

545
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,540
to be faithful in our marriage

546
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,580
and be your lifelong companion.

547
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,700
But I really cannot

548
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,340
change my character
for the sake of marriage.

549
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,420
Faithful to marriage.

550
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,580
Mutual companionship.

551
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,700
Aren't those the most basic things
in marriage?

552
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,220
I just want a little bit more honesty.

553
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,140
Is that too much to ask?

554
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:45,820
Fine.

555
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,300
You wanted me
to stop treating you like a child.

556
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,860
Then let's talk about this openly

557
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,100
like two adults.

558
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,740
There is always

559
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,380
a boundary in my heart

560
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,140
when it comes to anyone

561
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,580
or any relationship.

562
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,020
I can't be completely transparent
with them.

563
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,540
Not even me?

564
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,300
Yes.

565
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,300
What if I insist?

566
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,820
Do you think all my ideas are wrong?

567
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:24,900
Ruanruan.

568
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,540
Every single day I spent with you,

569
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,860
I felt really happy.

570
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,380
I felt at ease too.

571
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,300
But if this

572
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,660
makes you unhappy,

573
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,620
perhaps you should redefine

574
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,780
our relationship.

575
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,900
Fu Xizhou.

576
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,060
You're so cruel.

577
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,340
I'm really tired.

578
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,460
I'm going to bed.

579
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,140
Dr. Ji.

580
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,420
Here.

581
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,380
Why did you suddenly come back?

582
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,620
You didn't even tell me.

583
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,700
Did you want to surprise me?

584
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,340
We'll be working together again.

585
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,820
How's that for a surprise?

586
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,020
So the new chief of our department

587
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,540
who's rumored to be a young and handsome

588
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,420
eligible bachelor

589
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,740
was you.

590
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,300
I didn't know you thought of me

591
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,020
as a handsome

592
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,020
and young

593
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,620
eligible bachelor.

594
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,060
I can die with no regrets now.

595
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,100
The nurses will be fighting over you.

596
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,860
Dr. Zhu.

597
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,260
Look.

598
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,980
You're exaggerating.

599
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,460
Why did you suddenly come back?

600
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,300
I have studied medicine abroad
for so long.

601
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,500
It's time I return to contribute
to my homeland.

602
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,660
Besides,

603
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,180
you are here.

604
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,660
Look like you really miss

605
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,820
partnering with me.

606
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,060
I miss it so, so much.

607
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,500
We have the same lunchtime.

608
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,700
I'll treat you to lunch.

609
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,500
Do I have the honor?

610
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,980
Let's have lunch here.

611
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,860
I'll show you the canteen.

612
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:23,740

Ms. Jiang.

639
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,300
I have information

640
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,900
that you would be very interested in.

641
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,620
Who are you?

642
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,580
It doesn't matter who I am.

643
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,980
The important thing
is what I am about to say.

644
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,500
I know how your son got injured
in Germany.

645
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,420
There's more. Look.

646
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,540
Lymphoma.

647
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,940
- Ten percent dosage.
- Mr. Fu Jr.

648
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,060
Ms. Cheng.

649
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:52,900
What's the matter?

650
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,540
Allow me to make a introduction.

651
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,580
This is Professor Yuan Jingliang.

652
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,180
I'm sure all of you

653
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,300
have heard of his name.

654
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,500
He's an experienced
pharmaceutical expert

655
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,740
in the industry.

656
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,540
He will be taking over Perdo.

657
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,660
Nice to meet you all.

658
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,660
Ms. Cheng.

659
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,860
What does that mean?

660
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,340
Literally what I said.

661
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,620
Mr. Chen, was there any part
you didn't understand?

662
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,100
As the person in charge,

663
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,060
how come I didn't know
the R&D Department was hiring?

664
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,940
Mr. Fu Jr.

665
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:30,860
You see.

666
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,940
Mr. Fu has always

667
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,060
been in charge of Perdo.

668
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,060
He encountered difficulties in R&D.

669
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,540
Since the company
can't solve it internally,

670
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,580
we had to bring in

671
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,860
a better expert.

672
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,060
Mr. Fu Jr.

673
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,540
Is there a problem with that?

674
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:46,980
