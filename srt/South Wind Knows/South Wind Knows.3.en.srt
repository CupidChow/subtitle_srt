If someone pays you
a million yuan

would you do it?

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,940

I can delete the images,

Whether it's supplies given to us

or supplies that we own,

138

00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,060
Wait.

175
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,260
If he's concerned about me,

176
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,980
why did he call you?

177
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,140
He knew that you were resting

178
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,620
and didn't want to disturb you.

179
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,100
What an excuse.

180
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,820

That's worse than terminating him.

185

186
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,060
to our western subsidiary company,

187
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,180

193
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,660
but he still acts hastily.

194
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,660
I'm worried
that he will cause some troubles

195
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,380
in the western branch.

196
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,020
Any company

197
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,580
would have jailed people
who were caught stealing.

198
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,980
Xizhou has been very lenient
with how he handled it.

199
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,580
That's right.

200
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,900
Jiang Jun is a good for nothing.

201
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,780
See?

202
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,060
He knows he's at fault,

203
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,860
and I ignored him
when he complained to me.

204
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,060
Then, he went to Yunshen to do the same

205
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,380
because they were close,
growing up together.

206
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,700
So, he came to question me.

207
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,780
How annoying.

208
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,980
The western subsidiary branch
was just set up,

209
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,460
they would also require

210
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,780
a person of authority to be there.

211
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,580
For Jiang Jun to be in that position,

212
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,020
he's just upholding responsibilities
that he should bear.

213
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,340
Don't regional managers need
to be well-rounded?

214
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,980
Jiang Jun is so naive.

215
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,220
This is a weakness of the Jiang family.

216
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,700
It's the same for Yunshen.

217
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,700
Yunshen is different from Jiang Jun.

218
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,820
Xizhou.

219
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,740
Since Jiang Jun is at fault,

220
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,260
he should be punished.

221
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,580
You can consider demoting him
or cutting his pay.

222
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,700
Madam Jiang.

223
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,860
The personnel changes
have already been announced.

224
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,540
That was very quick.

225
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,140
There, there.

226
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,740
Let's eat.

227
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,300
Dad.

228
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,900
I'm really concerned about transferring

229
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,180
Jiang Jun to such a distant place.

230
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,700
Why don't you assign him to me

231
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,900
and I will keep an eye on him?

232
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,260
An assistant manager
at the warehouse resigned.

233
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,940
If you send him there,

234
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,340
the tough work in the warehouse

235
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,780
will help him control his temper.

236
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,780
What do you think?

237
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,540
Fine, then.

238
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,900
Make sure he's grounded

239
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,860
and stop behaving so recklessly.

240
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,140
If he makes another mistake,

241
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,780
he will be terminated.

242
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,180
Don't worry.

243
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,740
I'll supervise him.

244
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,060
Dad, let me get you some more.

245
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,020
Okay, that's enough.

246
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,020
Boss.

247
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,740
Earthquake!

248
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,660
What are you doing?

249
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,700
That was frightening.

250
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,820
What earthquake?

251
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,700
Do you have any conscience?

252
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,020
If it wasn't for me,

253
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,340
you would've flown out the window.

254
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,260
Thanks.

255
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,300
Is everyone okay?

256
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,420
Let's go.

257
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,140
They have troops here?

258
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,980
They are volunteer doctors.

259
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,380
They are going to provide treatment
in the village.

260
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,700
You, get down.

261
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,780
What is the problem?

262
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,140
Quickly!

263
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,660
My passport.

264
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,220
Up your hands.

265
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:08,940
Come.

266
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,340
What are you doing?

267
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,940
What are you doing?

268
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,940
Sorry, it's a misunderstanding.

269
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,500
They really are doctors.

270
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,420
Yes, I know your officer,

271
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,300
Mr. Danwei.

272
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,420
No!

273
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,380
They are not the regular army.

274
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,100
Don't move!

275
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,780
Easy, easy.

276
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,460
Don't move!

277
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,060
Easy, easy.

278
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,580
Don't move!

279
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,780
- Don't move.
- Easy.

280
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,380
Take it easy.

281
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,700
You're lucky today.

282
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,860
Get lost.

283
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:52,780
Okay.

284
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,300
Get into the car.

285
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,100
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

286
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,060
- Be careful, you two.
- Okay.

287
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:28,940
Here.

288
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,140
Over here.

289
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,540
You found a good spot.

290
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,300
Okay.

291
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,940
Take it slow.

292
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:41,820
Over here.

293
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,100
Come.

294
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,380
- It's all right.
- Okay.

295
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,700
Wait for a moment here.

296
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,260
It rained over the last few days.

297
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,340
I'll see if that path is still there.

298
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,580
Be careful.

299
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,420
Dr. Zhu.

300
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,460
This flower is poisonous.

301
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,860
Over here,

302
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,500
many tribes use it to make poison
to be applied to their weapons.

303
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,900
Are you trying to scare me?

304
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,580
This is a gerbera daisy,

305
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,820
I know that.

306
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,780
The most dangerous part

307
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
of a gerbera daisy would be its pistils.

308
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,180
It contains phorbol

309
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,820
which strongly stimulates
the human heart.

310
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,900
Excessive exposure

311
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,340
will lead to skin numbness
and organ failure.

312
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,700
By the way, Dr. Zhu.

313
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,940
You didn't touch it, did you?

314
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,420
Of course not.

315
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,660
Good, then.

316
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,500
What if I sniffed it up close?

317
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,700
Will I get poisoned?

318
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,220
Of course.

319
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,460
Pistils are receptive to pollen.

320
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,660
Why do you think so many people

321
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,700
are allergic to pollen?

322
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,020
What do I do?

323
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,940
I sniffed it.

324
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,500
Deeply, even.

325
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,100
Don't move.

326
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:22,860
Dr. Zhu.

327
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,820
How many steps did you take?

328
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,980
About two?

329
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,980
Then you should stop walking.

330
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,260
This will increase your blood circulation
and speed up the poisoning process.

331
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,820
You will die.

332
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,020
Fu Yunshen.

333
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,260
Do you really think

334
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,860
I will believe it?

335
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,060
Here, boss.

336
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,140
Phorbol.

337
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,580
Is that fun?

338
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,940
It's fun.

339
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,420
Dr. Zhu.

340
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:29,940
Are you okay?

341
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,020
I'm fine.

342
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,260
You can rest if you're tired.

343
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,740
You don't have to act tough.

344
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,580
Don't move.

345
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:58,940
Does it hurt?

346
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,460
No.

347
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,420
Chinese mugwort.

348
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,380
Here.

349
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:10,820
You...

350
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:00,900
There you go.

351
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,100
Okay.

352
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,780
Let's hurry and leave.

353
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,180
Before it gets dark,

354
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,380
we should set up camp
on a spacious ground.

355
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,780
Do you want to rest?

356
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,780
I'm fine.

357
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,460
Leave it to me.

358
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,980
Thanks, Sen.

359
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,220
Take it slow.

360
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,700
Over here.

361
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,220
Are you sure you're okay?

362
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,500
I can carry you.

363
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,660
I'm really okay.

364
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,580
I can walk.

365
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,420
Come on.

366
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,580
I'm fine.

367
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,780
Stop babbling on.

368
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,820
(Luckily, I brought some medication
for this trip.)

369
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,940
(Otherwise, Fu Yunshen
will complain again.)

370
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,260
Anson.

371
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,500
My boss uses this.

372
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,740
Here, boss.

373
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,060
Where is Dr. Zhu?

374
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,300
Asleep.

375
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,340
Anson.

376
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,260
Don't you want any?

377
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,140
These firewood won't last
until tomorrow morning.

378
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,300
I'll get some more.

379
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,100
Anson, let me help you.

380
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,740
Dr. Zhu, get up and eat.

381
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,500
Dr. Zhu, get up and eat.

382
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
I'll pass.

383
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,100
Are you unwell?

384
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,180
I'm fine.

385
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,540
I injected some antibiotics.

386
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,900
How do I look?

387
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,180
You're recovering well.

388
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,140
I'm sure you'll be just fine tomorrow.

389
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,900
Don't lie.

390
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,820
Did you forget what I studied?

391
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,220
Acute allergy, leech saliva.

392
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,220
Who would've known?

393
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,820
I was just started to not dislike you

394
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,740
and I'm about to die.

395
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,940
You don't dislike me anymore?

396
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,060
How long will it take for you
to adore me?

397
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,580
Fu Yunshen.

398
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,500
Can you promise me one thing?

399
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,540
Go on.

400
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,940
If anything goes wrong,

401
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,380
there is a hand-sewn pocket

402
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,620
inside my backpack.

403
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,580
There are two bank cards in there.

404
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,060
You must hand those cards

405
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,260
over to my grandmother.

406
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,820
Also,

407
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,780
if anyone comes to Heidelberg,

408
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,060
you must tell them

409
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,300
to take care of my stray cats.

410
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,300
Its name is Jindan.

411
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,380
And help me ask Professor Hans

412
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,060
if I have insurance.

413
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,940
If I do, put my grandmother
as my beneficiary.

414
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,500
Otherwise,

415
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,020
help me ask

416
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,900
if I get any employee compensation.

417
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,300
Don't forget.

418
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,060
Don't sleep.

419
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,900
You haven't told me the PIN number.

420
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,140
I will tell my grandmother

421
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,940
the bank PIN number in her dreams.

422
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,420
Fu Yunshen.

423
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,620
Isn't this place a tropic?

424
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,780
Why is it so cold?

425
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,860
I feel terrible.

426
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,420
If I die,

427
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,100
my grandmother won't be able
to accept it.

428
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,420
I studied every day.

429
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,300
I've never dated anyone.

430
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,860
I really don't want to die.

431
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,140
I really don't want to die.

432
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,780
I shouldn't have come
in the first place.

433
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,180
Don't worry.

434
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,620
Mint has great vitality.

435
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:17,780
That's enough.

436
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:18,860
That's enough?

437
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:23,940
Boss.

438
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,220
Where are you going?

439
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,020
Back to Shanghai.

440
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,500

Boss.

470
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,860
Why did you sleep here?

471
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,700
What if you catch a cold?

472
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,460
Stay on guard.

473
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,580
Boss.

474
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,380
What are you doing?

475
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,940
Dr. Zhu is unwell.

476
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,700
I know you won't leave
before she recovers.

477
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,260
Chen Le.

478
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,180
I will tell you one more time.

479
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,460
She is our teammate.

480
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,220
Yes, she is our teammate.

481
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,500
I totally

482
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,620
got the message.

483
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,180
But when Dr. Zhu is sick,

484
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,100
somebody takes care of her.

485
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,420
If I were sick,

486
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,300
I would have been abandoned
on the streets.

487
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,700
What is this?

488
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,780
It's made to treat diarrhea
and acclimatization.

489
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,460
Boss.

490
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,860
You made this for me?

491
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,740
Boss, don't you worry.

492
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,020
I will be sure to drink it up.

493
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,300
How are you? Better?

494
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,260
Is that too pretentious?

495
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,500
Did you tell

496
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,020
your grandmother the bank PIN number?

497
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,340
Too inauspicious.

498
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,100
Should I get you more herbs?

499
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,940
It doesn't seem like
you've recovered fully.

500
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,580
I'm so silly.

501
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,540
