Dad, Mom.

22
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,580
I never planned to have a wedding.

23
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,660
I attended

24
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,620
a friend's wedding recently.

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,340
The process was so cumbersome.

26
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,540
It was exhausting.

27
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,420
And the parents were just as tired.

28
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,740
I don't want to trouble you.

29
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,740
Ruanruan,

30
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,580
your dad and I don't mind it.

31
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,660
Mom,

32
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,460
you've always told me

33
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,900
what matters in a marriage

34
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,580

50
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,140
I'd like to ask you a favor.

51
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,740
What is it?

52
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,260
Don't be fooled by
Ruanruan's usual cheerful appearance.

53
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,340
She used to cry a lot when she was little.

54
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,500
She would cry to the point of exhaustion
over small things.

55
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,940
And

56
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,740
when she cried, she'd have trouble
catching her breath.

57
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,820
One time, she almost lost her life.

58
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,140
Why are you bringing this up?

59
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,460
Didn't she get better
after she turned five?

60
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,180
She's fine now.

61
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,500
I'm still afraid

62
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,780
at the thought of it now.

The scariest thing in my life

is when my daughter cries.

Well, eat up.

71
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,260
Come, let's eat.

72
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:30,860
Let's dig in.

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,180
Here.

74
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,660
I'll get started, then.

75
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,020
Try this chicken wing.

76
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:44,980
Wutong,

77
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,060
you'll get some of the noodles too.

78
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,780
I might have cooked too much.

79
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,980
You should eat some too.

80
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,460
I'll add some salt.

81
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,780
For it to taste better, I'll add some MSG.

82
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,420
I'll add pepper as it dispels cold.

83
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,260
In case he catches another cold
in this cold weather.

84
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,380

89
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,380
have a taste.

90
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,700
You shouldn't judge its taste from its look.

91
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,100
It may look unappetizing.

92
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,300
But it's definitely delicious.

93
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,260
Come on, have a taste.

94
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,820
Just a little bite.

95
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,300
Try a little bit.

96
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,540
It's really delicious.

97
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,260
You don't believe me?

98
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,420
I'll eat, and let you know its taste.

99
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,980
How nice...

00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,820

Rolling in the good luck.

102
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,340
Rolling out the bad luck.

103
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,020
Rolling in good health.

104
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,300
Rolling out the illness.

This is what my grandma used to say.

She used to say

108
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,380
when you roll an egg, you must crack it.

109
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,100
If it cracks open in one try,

110
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,980
it means you're very clever.

111
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:07,900
Here.

112
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,980
Take it.

I said I'm giving you all my good luck.

121

Oh, thanks.

Not bad.

126
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,260
It's overcooked.

127
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,980
It's just nice.

128
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,540
I also cooked some longevity noodles.

129

Actually, they taste quite good.

130
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,420
Do you want to try them?

131
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,580
No, thank you.

132
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,780
Come on, try them.

133
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,860
I really don't want any.

134
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Fine, I'll try them.

135
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,420
Go and prepare them.

136
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,620
It'll be ready soon.

Are you ready?

139
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,620
Do you want to take this seriously?

140
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,620
Yes, I do.

But it's too dark here.

149
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,420
Reading in the dark is bad for your eyes.

150
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,500
It's normal for your eyes
to sting a little.

151
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,940
You've been away from the sunlight
for a long time.

is especially nice today.

Do you want...

154
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,540
I'm not going outside.
So don't even think about it.

155
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,420
What did I say?

156
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,420
I meant to ask if you want coffee

157
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,780
or have some plants around.

Don't you recognize this plant?

It's mint.

it can keep you company.

I don't want it. Take it away.

169
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,500
Smell it.

170
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,500
Take a whiff.

171
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,100
Take it away.

172

Smell it.

173
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,820
- Come on, smell it.

Nowhere.

What happened to your finger?

184
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,860
I broke a vase at home

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,740
and cut myself.

186

It's nothing serious.

187
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,820
How is it not serious when it's bandaged this way?

188
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,940
Be more careful.

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,900
I will.

190
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,980
Don't tell me

191
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,580
Fu Yunshen did this.

192
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,100
It really was him, huh?

193
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,380
This brat

194
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,860
is getting hard to please now.

195
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,900
Just wait until I wrap him up
and bring him back to Shanghai.

196
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,420
You said it yourself.

197
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,540
Count me in, then.

198
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,060
We'll wrap him up just like this bandage.

199
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,900
Yes, just like this.

200
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,580
Mint.

201
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,820
Previously, you told me

202
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,380
you're working as a family doctor
at a friend's place.

203
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,940
Is that Mr. Fu?

204
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,660
Yes, it's him.

205
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,860
Dr. Ji,

206
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,620
I have something else to attend to.

207
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,500
I'll get going now.

208
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,140
All right.

209
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:02,980
Bye.

210
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,540
Don't worry.

211
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,100
I will handle things for you.

212
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,300
I'll take that as a deal.

213
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,460
Dr. Ji,

214
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,780
don't tell me you have feelings for Mint.

215
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,540
Don't be ridiculous.

216
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,780
If you like her, just admit it.

217
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,220
Why are you hesitating?

218
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,660
I'm not sure

219
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,180
what kind of feelings

220
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,260
I have for her, either.

221
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,460
Please come in.

222
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,460
Yunshen,

223
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,740
it's me.

224
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,980
I took annual leave to come over...

225
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,860
Yunshen,

226
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,220
the decoration here is quite unique.

227
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,460
The furnishings are also special.

228
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,620
On my way here,

229
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,740
I saw the flowers in the yard have all bloomed.

230
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,580
They're so beautiful.

231
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,820
I wonder what kind of flowers they are.

232
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,180
I remember when you were a child,
you loved plum blossoms the most.

233
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,820
The plum blossoms Grandpa planted
in Shanghai have all bloomed.

234
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,660
Why don't we return to Shanghai
and enjoy the view?

235
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,500
If you don't want to go back,
that's fine.

236
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,620
We can also buy some here

237
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,620
and plant them ourselves.

238
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,780
What do you think?

239
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,780
My mom told you to come, right?

240
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,380
Yes.

241
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,260
She and Grandpa are worried about you.

242
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,140
Yunshen,

243
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
can I throw this away?

244
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:58,900
Yes.

245
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,380
You are...

246
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:12,820
Hello,

247
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,780
I'm the family doctor here.

248
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,780
I'm Zhu Jiu.

249
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,500
Hello, Dr. Zhu.

250
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,060
Thank you for your efforts during this time.

251
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,780
Do you have any business here?

252
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,980
Nothing important.

253
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,220
I came to tell Yunshen

254
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,540
that my finger was fine.

255
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,460
I saw this mint plant on the floor.

256
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,940
I was about to pick it up and throw it away.

257
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,420
Why are you throwing it away?

258
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,420
I told her to do so.

259
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,700
When someone gives you something,

260
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,740
you should keep it.

261
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,820
Since it's for me,

262
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,260
I can do whatever I want with it.

263
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,540
Dr. Zhu, please leave.

264
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,620
Please don't disturb us.

265
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,020
All right.

266
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,100
Yunshen...

267
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,380
You should leave too. I'm tired.

268
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,900
Well, do rest early.

269
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,460
Ruanruan.

270
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,820
Is this the living room?

271
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,940
Feel free to look around.

272
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,380
Nothing has changed here for decades.

273
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,620
Just tell me if you need anything.

274
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,660
If so, I'll take a look around.

275
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,580
So many bottles of alcohol.

276
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,020
Don't drink so much on regular days.

277
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,380
I'll go and get you a glass of water.

278
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,540
Xizhou.

279
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,940
Xizhou?

280
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,500
Thank you.

281
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,700
What do you think?

282
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,740
Thank you for bringing me

283
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,500
to where you grew up.

284
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,180
If you don't like it,

285
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,500
you can decorate it

286
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,300
according to your own style.

287
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,700
I think it's good enough.

288
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,100
If I must give any suggestion,

289
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,260
this place lacks bright colors.

290
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,380
Don't make it too pink.

291
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,300
What's wrong with pink?

292
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,740
Pink is an adorable color.

293
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,620
I was only kidding.

294
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,220
I won't make it pink

295
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,020
because I'm the adorable pink

296
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,540
in this house.

297
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,820
You're smiling!

298
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,300
What a pity.

299
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,780
I didn't manage to capture it

300
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,020
because I didn't bring my camera today.

301
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,780
Here.

302
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,900
Give me another smile.

303
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,460
Smile, please.

304
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,620
I'll go upstairs first.

305
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,700
Mint,

306
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,980
Mr. Fu has been coughing.

307
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,940
You should go and check on him.

308
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,580
Okay.

309
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,820
Linda said you've been coughing.

310
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,380
Is your throat sore?

311
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,060
I'm fine.

312
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,580
I'll check your temperature.

313
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,220
No need.

314
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,180
Stay still.

315
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,340
Yunshen...

316
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,100
Yunshen,

317
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,740
the chicken soup is ready.

318
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,820
Enjoy it before it gets cold.

319
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,140
If your throat isn't feeling well,

320
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,340
eating chicken soup will make it worse.

321
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,260
Oh, right, Dr. Zhu.

322
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,900
Starting tomorrow,

323
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,980
I'll be taking over
as Yunshen's new family doctor.

324
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,180
You don't need to come anymore.

325
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,860
Thank you for your efforts
during this time.

326
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,900
I'll have Linda handle your salary.

327
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,580
Have Leo talk to me about it.

328
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:36,940
Zhizhi,

329
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,860
I'm sorry.

330
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,700
Finish the soup while it's still warm.

331
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,220
Go to bed early.

332
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,980
What's wrong?

333
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,300
Why are you up so early today?

334
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,980
I can't sleep.

335
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,220
Xizhou and I are getting married.

336
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,580
You're getting married to Xizhou?

337
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,140
Gu Ruanruan, congratulations!

338
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,140
That's great! Your wish
has finally come true.

339
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,900
I want to be your bridesmaid.

340
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,740
It's a deal, okay?

341
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,100
What's with that look?

342
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,420
Don't tell me you already
have a bridesmaid.

343
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,900
Of course not.

344
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,020
We've decided not to have a wedding.

345
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,380
No wedding?

346
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,620
Is this Fu Xizhou's idea?

347
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,820
Of course not.

348
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,060
It's my decision.

349
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,420
Weddings are expensive and tiring.

350
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,300
I don't like them.

351
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,860
You don't like them because he doesn't.

352
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,420
No, no.

353
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,100
I want to save that money

354
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,860
to do something more meaningful.

355
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,180
Forget it.

356
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,420
You'll always take Fu Xizhou's side anyway.

357
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,740
Aren't you the same?

358
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,260
You're always taking Fu Yunshen's side.

359
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,220
By the way,

360
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,420
how is Fu Yunshen?

361
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,940
Not bad.

362
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,140
Much better than before.

363
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,660
How far have you and Fu Yunshen gone?

364
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,060
You traveled all this way to see him.

365
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,460
Was he really touched?

366
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,260
What's wrong?

367
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,620
Did Fu Yunshen mistreat you again?

368
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,340
No, he didn't.

369
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,860
He's still not willing
to return to Shanghai with me.

370
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,620
But I haven't given up.

371
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,060
I'm still working hard on it.

372
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,060
Are you sure you're okay?

373
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,140
Yes, I'll be fine.

374
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,540

412

00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,540
has been done before in the company.

561
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:48,980
How about this?

562
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,220
Finalize everything with Mr. He quickly.

563
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,820
I'll take care
of the contract signing process.

564
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,140
But...

565
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,340
Wouldn't it be inappropriate
to do so behind Mr. Fu's back?

566
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,580
If he finds out later,

567
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,460
he'll definitely...

568
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,180
I'll take responsibility
if anything goes wrong.

569
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,540
Ms. Jiang,

570
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,860
why don't we wait a bit longer?

571
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,860
I'll go and talk to Mr. He again.

572
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:10,980
Luo Jiang,

573
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,900
how long have you been with the company?

574
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,100
Four years.

575
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,700
The manager who was promoted

576
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,860
from your department

577
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,500
has only been here for two years.

578
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,900
In terms of capability and performance,
he's not as good as you.

579
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,580
But he helped Fu Xizhou secure
the Vietnamese market.

580
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,300
Singapore is
what Mr. Fu Senior values most.

581
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,620
If we can secure this order,

582
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
I can easily

583
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,420
promote you to manager.

584
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,300
I understand, Ms. Jiang.

585
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,500
But it'll be Chinese New Year soon.

586
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,260
The process might be a bit slower.

587
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,500
At the latest, I want to see the contract
after the holiday.

588
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,540
Of course.

589
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,060
Ms. Jiang, goodbye.

590
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,620
Please reorganize this information

591
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,500
and send it to me.

592
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,220
Okay.

593
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,340
Ms. Jiang.

594
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,980
Have you been in touch
with Yunshen recently?

595
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,300
No,

596
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,940
he doesn't answer my calls

597
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,300
or reply to my messages.

598
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,180
I shouldn't have agreed
to let him go to Heidelberg back then.

599
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,460
His health hasn't improved at all.

600
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,460
I can't even see him now.

601
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,060
You don't need to worry too much.

602
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,180
I heard Yunshen's condition
has improved a lot recently.

603
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,260
Improved?

604
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,060
He still refuses treatment.

605
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,660
All he does is lock himself
in his room every day.

606
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,660
Well, not really.

607
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,380
With Dr. Zhu...

608
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,260
Under the care of the doctor
Leo recommended,

609
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,700
Yunshen will get better.

610
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,340
I sent Zhizhi to Heidelberg
to bring him back.

611
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,260
It's cold there in winter.

612
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,420
Since he refuses treatment,

613
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,180
it's better for him
to recuperate peacefully in Shanghai.

614
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,260
You sent Zhizhi to Heidelberg?

615
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,340
Yes.

616
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,460
It was your idea to send him
to Heidelberg in the first place.

617
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,940
You better convince him to return.

618
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,660
Be quick about it.

619
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,340
Take care.
