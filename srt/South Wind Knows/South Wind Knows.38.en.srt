00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,630
it will be a beautiful dream.

192
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,430
Just do what you do.

193
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,630
Let go of me.

194
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,390
I want to see my friend!

195
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,230
I want to see my friend!

196
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,950
Let me go!

197
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,270
Let go of me!

198
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,910
Why did you save me?

199
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,230
Why did you save me?

200
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,430
Because I'm a doctor.

201
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,030
I will not be thankful to you.

202
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,380
You are supporting Hank's slaughter.

203
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,340
Why did they want to catch you?

204
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:28,710
Hank

205
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,550
wants to find out

206
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,550
where their chief was moved to,

207
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,510
so they keep torturing me.

208
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,030
I'm afraid...

209
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,910
I'm afraid I won't
be able to keep it from them.

210
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,990
Please, please let me die.

211
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,510
Please!

212
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,550
In war,

213
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,790
everyone can tell a lie

214
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,350
as if it's real.

215
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,550
Why? Tell me why?

216
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,070
Tell me why.

217
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,150
The pain after an amputation

218
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,150
is unbearable.

219
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,990
These medications
will make you feel better.

220
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,310
Our village was burned.

221
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,510
They raped my wife.

222
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,790
They injected my children with drugs

223
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,590
to control them
and let them kill each other.

224
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,190

225
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,590

226
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,430

If I die,

231
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,150

to bargain with the government.

232
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,870

Dr. Zhu and Dr. Ji from Hope

236
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,750

Hello, Chen Le.

240
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,510
I'm Ruanruan.

241
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,750
I called Fu Yunshen, but he didn't answer.

242
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,590
Do you know what happened to Dr. Zhu?

243
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,550
Yes.

244
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,030
Boss has contacted me.

245
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,510
Did he?

246
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,510
So, what's going on with them now?

247
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,110
I don't have any news yet.

248
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,470
How did this happen?

249
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,070
Dr. Zhu and the others were fine
when I went there last time.

250
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,990
I can't do anything to help here.

251
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,030
Ruanruan,

252
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,590
don't worry too much.

253
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,470
Xizhou has gone to Country M.

254
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,550
With his help,

255
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,510
Dr. Zhu and the others will be fine.

256
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,070
Fu Xizhou went there, too?

257
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,230
Hello, Zhizhi.

258
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,910
I'm sorry to bother you

259
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,110
so late.

260
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,310
I just want to make sure with you.

261
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,470

I'm already in Country M.

I sent her something,

269

I think it was shipped to Country M.

270
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,630
But I haven't really been able

271
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,510

We have enough manpower and weapons.

380
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,510
No.

381
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,510
I have to make certain
that the people and the civilians there

382
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,470
are all safe.

383
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,670
I can't make you any promises.

384
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,390
You're asking too much.

385
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,550
Who gave you the right
to behave like this in my office?

386
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,070
I hope you know who you are speaking to.

387
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,390
He is my brother.

388
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,470
We shouldn't talk too much today.

389
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,150
I hope you can contact us

390
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,750
after you seriously think things through,

391
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,350
OK?

392
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,230
Let's go.

393
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,790
Come on!

394
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,430
Hurry up.

395
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:07,470
Go!

396
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:10,910
Hurry up!

397
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,390
Go, go, go.

398
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,670
Go.

399
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,150
Mint.

400
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,070
Your shoelace is untied.

401
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,350
What are you doing?

402
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,950
Dr. Ji!

403
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,430
Dr. Ji!

404
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,030
Go!

405
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,630
This way!

406
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,150
Come here!

407
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,910
Go, go!

408
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,510
Go! Hurry!

409
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,630
Faster!

410
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:27,470
Go! Quick! Hurry! Faster!

411
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:39,790
Mr. Fu!

412
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,910
Mr. Fu!

413
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,180
Villagers saw

414
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,870
Dr. Zhu escape by herself,

415
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,430
going toward the direction of Patao.

416
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,070
Great.

417
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,710
Dr. Ji!

418
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,750
Mint,

419
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,310
are you OK?

420
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:02,910
Mint,

421
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,910
if it's possible...

422
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,430
if it's possible,

423
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,030
escape by yourself.

424
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,350
This time,

425
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,310
I can't help you anymore.

426
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,110
We must survive together

427
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,110
and escape together.

428
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,950
It's too late.

429
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,870
I'm a doctor,

430
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,630
a great doctor, too.

431
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,950
I killed that man.

432
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,150
I killed him.

433
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,430
His name is

434
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,670
Peter.

435
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,510
What's your name?

436
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,190
Real name.

437
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,990
Peter Raphael.

438
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,430
I'm sorry.

439
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,660
[Morphine]

440
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,350
Dr. Ji!

441
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,790
I'm finally free.

442
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,590
This is great.

443
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,270
I wish

444
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,670
I could have a drink now.

445
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,070
Mint,

446
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,270
don't cry.

447
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,950
Promise me

448
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,470
that you will be brave.

449
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,390
In the future,

450
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,110
when you visit my tomb,

451
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,190
remember to bring some alcohol.

452
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:47,590
I want the strongest one.
