00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,030
Make this office the way it was.

192
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,310
OK.

193
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,230
By the way,

194
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,950
Mr. Fu Jr.

195
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,350
is leaving Shanghai today.

196
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,070
Where's he going?

197
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:15,990
Country M.

198
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:51,710
Jia.

199
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,590
How's that girl?

200
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,430
It's been a dozen days,

201
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,630
and she's still rejected treatment.

202
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,030
Her wound isn't recovering well.

203
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,750
At first, she was very emotional.

204
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,990
Later, she didn't speak or eat.

205
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,750
Ruanruan,

206
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,670
did you talk to her?

207
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,580
I tried talking to her several times,

208
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,910
but she didn't reply at all.

209
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,950
Being so negative

210
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,060
is bad for her treatment and recovery.

211
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,340
Yeah.

212
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,750
But we can't force her.

213
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,630
She has PTSD.

214
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,340
Mint,

215
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,950
apply to Andy

216
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,790
for a psychologist from the headquarters.

217
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,670
I've applied several times.

218
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,190
But no one is appropriate for the moment.

219
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,270
Doctor!

220
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,910
You finish lunch.

221
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,790
I'll go have a look.

222
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,390
OK.

223
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,030
Come, Jia.

224
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:52,910
Eat it quickly.

225
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,950
Cold food will taste bad.

226
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,550
I can't eat.

227
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,950
Actually,

228
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,830
I was just like you
when I first came here.

229
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,270
Every day, I saw so many patients come.

230
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,190
On busy occasions,

231
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,390
we had a dozen operations every day.

232
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,950
I felt so hungry

233
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,430
and tired.

234
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,070
But I just didn't have any appetite.

235
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,630
I couldn't sleep, either.

236
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,750
How did you adapt to this life?

237
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,470
I'm a doctor.

238
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,310
I have to eat regularly

239
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,630
and sleep well

240
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,990
so that I can be strong enough
to take care of more patients.

241
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,790
Dr. Zhu,

242
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,870
I'm leaving tomorrow.

243
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,270
But I'm still worrying about that girl.

244
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,270
Will she get better?

245
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,670
I don't know.

246
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:53,350
Psychological trauma is harder
to be cured than a wound.

247
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,630
Don't think so much.

248
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,310
Just eat.

249
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,110
Eat something, and you'll have energy.

250
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,310
Leo,

251
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,070
what about the psychologist I asked for?

252
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,950
It's very likely

253
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,470
that I've got one for you.

254
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,230
What do you mean by "likely"?

255
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,470
How's that girl doing?

256
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,870
Her wounds have recovered.

257
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,430
But...

258
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,990
We need a psychologist.

259
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,590
Look.

260
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,710
Tomorrow,

261
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,430
you bring that girl to me.

262
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,790
Staying in a new place will do her good.

263
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,230
And remember,

264
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,190
do bring her here personally.

265
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,350
What have you got up in your sleeve?

266
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,350
You also learned some psychology.

267
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,110
Bring her here,

268
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,190
and we'll consult together.

269
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,390
OK. I get it.

270
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,350
See you tomorrow.

271
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,750
Keep using these two bottles of drugs.

272
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,270
OK.

273
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,270
Go make a record.

274
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:37,790
OK.

275
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,150
Lift it higher.

276
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,870
OK.

277
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,150
It will make him more comfortable.

278
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,510
Nurse.

279
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,470
For Bed No.3.

280
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,110
Wait a minute.

281
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,030
There you are, at last.

282
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,030
I've been looking forward
to this day for long.

283
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,230
So,

284
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,030
how's your health?

285
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,310
I've been crazy busy.

286
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,190
Have a look.

287
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,910
We lack doctors,

288
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,870
helpers,

289
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,430
and medicine.

290
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,470
All right.

291
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,190
I know you came for Zhu Jiu.

292
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,790
And I've got everything ready for you.

293
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,310
What do you mean?

294
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,310
Here's the thing.

295
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,870
A little girl

296
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,590
was injured by a landmine.

297
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,110
Zhu Jiu has nearly

298
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,230
cured her wounds.

299
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,230
But she's got some mental problems.

300
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,430
I need a psychologist.

301
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,310
Me?

302
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,390
Yeah.

303
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,750
But I'm not a doctor.

304
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,030
You have experience.

305
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,990
Zhu Jiu cares about this girl very much.

306
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,310
And tomorrow,

307
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,790
she's coming with this girl.

308
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,350
I think you can give her a surprise.

309
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,870
What do you think?

310
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,430
Not a good idea.

311
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,510
As far as I see,

312
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,390
when you help this girl,
you help yourselves.

313
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,150
All right.

314
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,070
Put your things away

315
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,390
and come help me.

316
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,830
I'm so busy.

317
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,270
She didn't say she would come today.

318
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,590
And neither did she say she wouldn't.

319
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,350
I know it's great
to meet up again after a while.

320
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,230
But do you have to be so happy?

321
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,390
I have to, of course.

322
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,310
I wonder

323
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,430
if you're getting a little bit numb.

324
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,150
Conditions here are poor.

325
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,710
Otherwise,

326
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,790
you would buy a bouquet.

327
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,030
We should go.

328
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,790
Two patients need
a timely change of dressing.

329
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,750
Don't overlook that.

330
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,110
OK. Don't worry, Dr. Zhu.

331
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,230
We'll take care of this.

332
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,350
It's dangerous everywhere.

333
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,550
You must stay safe.

334
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,910
Don't worry. She's got me.

335
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,830
You should go back.

336
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,510
Go.

337
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,230
OK.

338
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:01,710
We'll go.

339
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,390
Be safe.

340
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,390
See you, Dr. Zhu.

341
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,030
Mr. Fu?

342
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,430
What are you doing here?

343
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,310
I didn't expect you to come.

344
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,630
Long time no see.

345
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,190
Dr. Zhu and Dr. Ji have gone
to deliver the supplies.

346
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,550
They'll be back soon.

347
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,950
When she knows you're here,

348
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,110
she'll be really happy.

349
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,350
Mary.

350
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,470
Hi.

351
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,990
Violent conflict on the border
of Country M became fierce.

352
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,790
Due to the fear of what happened in Libya

353
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,590
earlier this year may repeat in Country M,

354
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,630
all embassies

355
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,990
are arranging
for their people's evacuation.

356
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,790
Hello.

357
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,110
Mr. Fu,

358
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,310
is there a blue folder with you?

359
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,910
I might have mixed it with other folders

360
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,790
when I gave them to you.

361
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,470
It's with me.

362
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,230
OK.

363
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,270
I'll go fetch it.

364
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:27,710
Don't bother.

365
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,630
I'll drop by

366
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,470
and give it to him.

367
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,630
I'm about to go to the gallery.

368
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,750
OK. Thank you, Mr. Fu.

369
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,910
[OR Center/Anesthesia Dept]

370
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,990
What have you come to see me about?

371
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,270
I'm here to deliver this.

372
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,590
Please give it to Mr. Zhou.

373
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,550
That's all?

374
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,190
Do you have any word from Ruanruan?

375
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,630
I contacted her a few days ago.

376
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,070
She's doing great, I think.

377
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,910
She lives a busy

378
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,750
and fulfilling life.

379
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,590
Do you know when she's coming back?

380
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,190
No.

381
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,110
Could you please get her back?

382
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,430
I don't mean anything by it.

383
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,350
I just know from the news

384
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,590
that Country M was very dangerous.

385
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,910
I don't want to disturb her.

386
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,990
I can't get in touch with her, either.

387
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,070
Her phone is disconnected,

388
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,030
and she's blocked me on WeChat.

389
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,070
Ruanruan once told me

390
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,910
when someone wants to avoid you,

391
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,550
it won't be easy for you to find him.

392
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,030
If you have any word from Ruanruan,

393
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,870
could you let me know?

394
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,190
She's my best friend.

395
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,030
She doesn't want you to reach her.

396
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,630
I'll give it to Mr. Zhou.

397
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,590
You like it?

398
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,430
I saw you stare at it for a while.

399
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,030
It reminded me of some spitballs.

400
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,710
Spitballs?

401
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,870
Nothing.

402
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,310
It's something that is broken.

403
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,670
It was made up

404
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,430
of lines

405
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,950
and made into artwork.

406
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,270
It was broken into pieces,

407
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,070
which was just where it started.

408
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,870
The shapes and materials are different,

409
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,190
but they're fundamentally the same.

410
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,390
It has a good name

411
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,990
that was given by a friend of mine.

412
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,150
She said,

413
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,550
[As Before, By Ji Fenghe]
"Only when we keep a pure heart

414
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,750
can we see what we first wanted

415
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,230
through a pile of broken pieces."

416
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,550
She was the curator of this exhibition.

417
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,670
We got along very well.

418
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,070
Unfortunately,

419
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,150
she left.

420
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:46,670
Mr. Fu,

421
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,230
the reporters are here.

422
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,950
How did you get the idea

423
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,350
of holding this exhibition?

424
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,310
It was the former curator who proposed it.

425
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,190
But before it was held,

426
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,230
she had left.

427
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,430
Left?

428
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,910
Are you saying
she left for another gallery?

429
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,630
She's gone abroad for some documentaries.

430
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,870
And she'll present more and better work.

431
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,110
Hope you'll follow her

432
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,350
and focus on her artwork.

433
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,510
Stop.

434
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,150
Get out.

435
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,550
Get out of the car.

436
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,910
You wait here.

437
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,870
I'll go talk to them.

438
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,870
Be very careful.

439
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,910
- Shut up!
- Calm down.

440
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,270
Listen to me, OK?

441
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,310
We're from the Hope Organization.

442
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,830
That is our doctor in the car.

443
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,950
We're here to help...

444
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,910
Come over here.

445
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,110
It's OK.

446
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,950
- Get out.
- OK...

447
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:42,550
Now!

448
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,550
We're doctors.

449
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,350
We're from the Hope Organization,

450
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,790
and we're here to deliver supplies.

451
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,350
We...

452
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:48,990
OK.

453
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,310
What are you doing?

454
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,590
You cannot treat us like this!

455
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,270
Dr. Ji!

456
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,070
Mint...

457
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,190
What are you doing?

458
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,270
Take him to the car!

459
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:01,710
Go.

460
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,750
- Go.
- Go.

461
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,990
Hurry up.

462
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,070
Dr. Ji.

463
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,470
Get out of the car.

464
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,430
Go...

465
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,750
Hurry up.

466
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,350
Hurry up. Go, go.

467
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,270
Hurry up.

468
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,390
This way.

469
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,260
[HOPE]

470
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,390
Let go!

471
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,430
Where are you taking us?

472
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,510
Don't touch me!

473
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,590
Don't touch...

474
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,550
Dr. Ji.

475
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,070
Dr. Ji.

476
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,670
Don't touch me.

477
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,110
We meet again,

478
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,990
Dr. Mint.

479
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,710
Hello. Hello?

480
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,470
Prepare the OR room.

481
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,310
Get a stretcher.

482
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,230
You saved me.

483
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,830
What's your name?

484
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,230
Mint.

485
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,470
Untie my rope.

486
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,870
OK.

487
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,630
Don't touch me.

488
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,590
Why did you keep us?

489
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,350
All right.

490
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,630
There's something else more important

491
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,950
that I forgot to tell you.

492
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,870
My uncle is sick.

493
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,230
I need a doctor.

494
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:04,350
Aren't you two very good doctors?

495
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,150
Where's the lady doctor?

496
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,550
Where are the patients here?

497
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,390
They are

498
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,030
too loud.

499
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,830
Too noisy.

500
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,910
So, we threw them out.

501
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,590
As for that lady doctor...

502
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,790
She doesn't listen.

503
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,350
I took care of that.

504
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,110
What did you do to her?

505
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,510
Don't feel bad, baby.

506
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,550
In this place,

507
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,070
people die every day.

508
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,270
You'll get used to me.

509
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,070
You're mad.

510
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,070
Mad! I'll kill you!

511
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,230
All right!

512
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,550
Time to get down to business.

513
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,910
My uncle is waiting for you guys.

514
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,750
You want us to save him?

515
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,230
Dreaming!

516
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,510
Really?

517
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,270
Really?

518
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,030
Let her go!

519
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,590
You let her go!

520
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,070
You let her go!

521
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,790
You let her go!

522
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:13,910
Mint...

523
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,750
Mint!

524
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:16,990
Mint!

525
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,470
Let her go!

526
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,150
Mint!

527
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:21,870
Mint...

528
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,270
Mint!

529
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,070
If you dare hurt her,

530
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,070
I will not save your uncle.

531
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:48,990
You...

532
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,390
Come with me.

533
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,110
Go!

534
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,190
Go!

535
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,470
What do you mean you can't find them?

536
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,470
We looked.

537
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,150
We didn't find anything.

538
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,950
What's next?

539
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,350
We guess that they have been kidnapped.
