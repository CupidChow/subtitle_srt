Be careful on your way.

190
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,700
Okay.

191
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,540
Mom, I'll get going now.

192
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,900
You've got me to thank for that.

193
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,580
Otherwise, your baby girl

194
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,500
will be a divorcee.

195
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,100
Let me drive you to the office.

196
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,860
No.

197
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,060
It's going to rain later.

198
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,380
It's okay. I can get a cab.

199
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,500
Ruanruan,

200
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,340
I'm here to take you home.

201
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,820
No.

202
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,980
Can I go now?

203
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,140
Ruanruan.

204
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,500
Will you stop throwing tantrums?

205
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,420
Don't waste our time arguing.

206
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,580
It's exhausting for both of us.

207
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,620
I told you I'm not throwing a tantrum.

208
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,860
Can't you understand?

209
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,420
It's not just me.

210
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,980
Dad thinks so too.

211
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,980
Fu Xizhou.

212
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,860
I wish you a lonely life.

213
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,580
Ruanruan!

214
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,660
You're back.

215
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,780
Eat some while it's hot before you sleep.

216
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,700
I'm going to work.

217
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,420
Again?

218
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,180
Alright.

219
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:27,820
I'll drive you there.

220
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:28,860
No.

221
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,420
Drowsy driving is prohibited.

222
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,420
It's okay.

223
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,020
You get some sleep first.

224
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,620
Then, you can pick me up at night

225
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,740
and we'll go out for a nice meal

226
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,980
and a movie.

227
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,660
Okay?

228
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,900
Zhu Jiu,

229
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,660
what should I do?

230
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,180
I seem to be in love with two people.

231
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,980
One

232
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,500
is a grumpy girl.

233
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,620
The other

234
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,700
is Dr. Zhu,
who saves lives and treats patients.

235
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,380
Leave now.

236
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,260
Or I'll go back on my word.

237
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,820
Dig in now.

238
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,220
Or the food will get cold.

239
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,580
Come in.

240
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,660
Dr. Ji,

241
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,780
what's wrong?

242
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,260
You look so serious.

243
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,500
I have something important to tell you.

244
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,780
Bad news?

245
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,500
Yes.

246
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,220
The bad news is

247
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,900
that you're going to be very busy,

248
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,020
working overtime every day,

249
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,940
and won't be able to see your boyfriend

250
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,020
until

251
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,660
Meng's surgery is done.

252
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,700
Is Meng ready for surgery?

253
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,740
We can start preparing.

254
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,020
Someone made a donation for Meng.

255
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,540
It's more than enough
for surgery and follow-up.

256
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,580
What's the organization?

257
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,300
Does it cover the follow-up treatment?

258
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
Top secret.

259
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,780
Orders from the higher-ups.

260
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,860
Stop playing with me.

261
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,780
We have to thank them.

262
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,020
From now on, you'll have to

263
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,420
leave your boyfriend aside

264
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,300
and spend time with me every day.

265
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,020
Okay.

266
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:38,740
Get back to work.

267
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,620
Hello, Yunshen.

268
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,260
I'm sorry,

269
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,820
I've been so busy with the surgery

270
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,860
that I forgot our date.

271
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,740
It's okay.

272
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,580
I understand.

273
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,580
I know you're working overtime.

274
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,220
I'll just go straight home.

275
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Thanks for understanding.

276
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,500
Be careful on your way back.

277
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,620
Bye.

278
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:43,940
Okay.

279
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,740
Let's do two more experiments
on the modeling.

280
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,620
But I think Meng's veins are too fragile.

281
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,340
Yes.

282
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,220
I'm going to wash my hands.

283
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,220
Let's talk when I'm back.

284
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,100
[The Needs of the Patient Come First]

285
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,180
Come in.

286
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,700
(To my beloved Dr. Zhu)

287
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,980
(and her female colleagues.)

288
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,260
(Male doctors aren't allowed to eat this.)

289
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,780
Who's this from?

290
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,660
Dr. Ji,

291
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,420
just ignore him.

292
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,300
That's what he's like.

293
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,460
Hi.

294
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,300
Hi, Dr. Zhu.

295
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,660
Hi.

296
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,100
Hi, Dr. Zhu.

297
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,540
I'm sure it's Jiu.

298
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,540
Bingo.

299
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,580
[Little Bunny]
Hello.

300
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,580
Hello.

301
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,180
Did you get off work?

302
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,740
Yes.

303
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,940
But I'm not going home today.

304
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,940
I'm staying at the hospital.

305
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,460
Well, wait for me.

306
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,660
I'll be right there.

307
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,940
I'll take some food for you.

308
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,980
Dr. Ji has an appointment tomorrow.

309
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,180
He's on a business trip.

310
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,060
I wish your senior

311
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,580
a safe journey.

312
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,260
"To my beloved Dr. Zhu
and her female colleagues.

313
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,900
Male doctors aren't allowed to eat this."

314
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,220
Are you serious?

315
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,460
I'm sure your senior
is thick-skinned enough

316
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,660
to finish it anyway.

317
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,100
How's the surgery?

318
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,780
I have to wait
for Dr. Ji's return tomorrow.

319
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,340
I'll finalize the plan with
the other mentors first.

320
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,060
Okay.

321
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,660
You should prepare for your surgery.

322
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,020
I'll take care of Grandma.

323
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,660
I'll pay her a visit

324
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,540
when I'm done with my work here.

325
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,300
Hello?

326
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,940
What's that sound?

327
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,380
I didn't catch that.

328
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,020
Liar.

329
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,060
Louder, please.

330
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,540
Dr. Zhu, don't be so petty.

331
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:26,980
Okay.

332
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,020
I'll make it up to you when I get back.

333
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,300
Okay, I want double.

334
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,860
Dr. Zhu.

335
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,580
Dr. Zhu,

336
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,620
go and take a look.

337
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,540
Talk later.

338
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,780
Come on, Meng. Take a bite.

339
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,340
No.

340
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,420
Take a bite, okay?

341
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,380
Meng, be good!

342
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,800
I'll take a bite now.

343
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,060
It's your turn now, okay?

344
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,460
You can't even feed her!

345
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,620
You've spoiled her!

346
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,820
Come on, open your mouth!

347
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,260
No.

348
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,060
Enough.

349
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,580
Don't force her
if she doesn't want to eat.

350
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,140
Will she eat if I don't force her?

351
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,860
I ran a couple of miles to get this!

352
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,100
Do you know how much it cost?

353
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,540
Look at the food here!

354
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,180
And here!

355
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,780
And take a look at the trash cans!

356
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,420
It all costs money!

357
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,820
It's not easy for me
to work several jobs a day!

358
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,740
I haven't slept a wink in days!

359
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,980
I know you're tired.

360
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,020
Don't act like a crazy person
in the hospital.

361
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,780
Dad, Mom, stop arguing.

362
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,100
Don't go crazy here!

363
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,860
Meng.

364
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,260
Mister,

365
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,980
I've told you many times.

366
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,980
This is a hospital!

367
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,300
If you're emotional,

368
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,180
please get out of here!

369
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,260
We have spent a lot of money
on our child's treatment.

370
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,460
Did you cure our child

371
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,980
after charging us money?

372
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,100
Listen,

373
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,860
I paid for this room.

374
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,460
I can make as much noise as I want!

375
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,580
What are you going to do about it?

376
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,460
What are you doing?

377
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,620
Get out. Don't go crazy here!

378
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,460
Dr. Zhu,

379
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,540
don't take it personally.

380
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,860
That's what he's like.

381
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,980
Just ignore him.

382
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,420
It's because Meng wouldn't eat,

383
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,140
so he...

384
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,980
Don't take it personally.

385
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,860
Infusion is irritating to the stomach.

386
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,540
It's normal that Meng doesn't like to eat.

387
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,740
But she must eat something.

388
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,460
I'll prescribe her
some nutritional fluids.

389
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,060
What nutritional fluids?

390
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,300
You want money again?

391
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,940
I know what you're going through.

392
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,500
I'll pay for the nutrient fluids.

393
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,860
Dr. Zhu,

394
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,860
thank you.

395
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,100
We're always bothering you.

396
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,740
I can't thank you enough.

397
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,500
No problem.

398
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,620
Meng,

399
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,060
don't be afraid.

400
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,580
I'm here.

401
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,620
It's fine now.

[Ji Silang]
(Mint,)

403
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,900
(from our point of view,)

404
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,300
(we have to do our best
to fight for the patient's hope)

405
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,500
(even if we have to take a big risk.)

406
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,420
(But at the same time, you have to remember)

407
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,460
(to accept the uncertainty of surgery.)

408
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,180
(After all, that's the only certainty)

409
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,620
(in surgery.)

410
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,220
(So don't think about it anymore.)

411
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,220
(Rest early.)

(You're a fortune teller, aren't you?)

415
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,940
(I can't reschedule this appointment.)

416
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,220
(I'll be back as soon as I can)

417
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,660
(to finish the surgery with you.)

418
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,700
(Thank you, Dr. Ji.)

419
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,740
(Goodnight.)

420
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,500
Let's do it.

421
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,060
Ms. Jiang,

422
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,220
the tide has finally turned

423
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,340
on the issue of vaccines.

424
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,540
Yunshen has done

425
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,860
a good and timely job in this matter.

426
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,060
It's all thanks to Yunshen's hard work.

427
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,860
He worked overtime, day and night.

428
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,620
I didn't expect him
to be good at administration

429
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,940
besides academics.

430
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,580
As I said,

431
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,540
Fu

432
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,020

433
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,060
no matter what he does.

434
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,820
You flatter him.

435
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,420
That's what he should do.

436
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,140
Yunshen

437
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,780
has always been a hard worker,

438
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,940
not much of a talker.

439
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,420
As his elders, please bear with him.

440
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,540
Lingtian's future decision maker

441
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,540
must be someone like Yunshen,

442
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,460
who understands R&D

443
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,860
and has the ability to be flexible

444
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,140
and improve staff bonding.

445
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,700
That's right.

Please.

The cause of the vaccine failure
has been identified.

448
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,140
It was a mistake made
by a new cold chain company

449
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,860
that the company was working with.

450
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,060
As you expected,

451
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,700
it's Jiang Jun, Ms. Jiang's nephew,

452
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,220
who took a big kickback from the company.

453

Sue the cold chain company.

454
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,540
Okay.

455
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,580
What about Jiang Jun?

456
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,140
Ignore him first.

457
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,140

Where's Jiang Jun?

496
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,540
You'd better tell me.

497
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,540
Because I'm not the only one
looking for him.

00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,380

of Chuantai Cold Chain.

505
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,860
Regarding the divorce agreement,

506
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,260
I'm willing to give up all assets
for a divorce.

507
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,340
I don't see what else there is to discuss.

508
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,180
I see you've lost weight.

509
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,580
Have you not been eating well lately?

510
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,540
My friend is still waiting for me.

511
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,060
If you haven't figured it out yet,

512
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,260
we'll talk about it another time.

513
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,820
How about this?

514
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,820
Let's get a cafe.

515
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,540
So we can sit down

516
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,860
and talk over a cup of coffee.

517
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,500
I never drink coffee.

518
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,860
If you don't have any problems
with the divorce papers,

519
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,340
go ahead and file them on Monday.

520
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,420
The marriage certificate is at home.
Remember to bring it with you.

521
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,220
I don't agree
with you giving up all assets.

522
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,940
About the divorce,

523
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,460
I'll get a lawyer

524
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,420
to get more details.

525
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,340
So...

526
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,900
I've told you many times.

527
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,500
I don't want anything.

528
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,460
You can have it all.

529
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,100
I don't want a divorce.

530
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,260
Who is there?

531
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,860
Who is there?

532
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,620
Who are you looking for?

533
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,140
Please leave us for now.

534
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,980
Who's it?

535
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,140
Yunshen?

536
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,690
You even managed to find me here.

537
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,380
You wouldn't even pick up your phone, huh?

538
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,020
What do you want?

539
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,020
Why don't you just tell me what you want?

540
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,420
How much did you take from Mr. Cheng?

541
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,380
Yunshen, I...

542
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

543
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,660
You don't?

544
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,180
Okay.

545
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,660
Then I'll call the police on you.

546
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,460
Don't do that.

547
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,460
Over a million yuan.

548
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,340
I returned the money
as soon as this happened.

549
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,060
I'm doing what's best for the company.

550
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,660
You know our family

551
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,300
isn't very well accepted in Lingtian.

552
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,820
I was just trying
to earn credit for our family.

553
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,740
So you're saying I should thank you?

554
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
That won't be necessary.

555
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,420
After all, something went wrong
with the cold chain.

556
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,660
I was doing it for you.

557
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,060
My brother,

558
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
we're real brothers.

559
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,700
I'm not your brother.

560
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,580
You're my dad, okay?

seize this opportunity

You don't have to think of me,

Does your aunt know

Fu Yunshen,

581
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,140

Don't forget it was the Jiang family
who raised you.

Your mom's surname is Jiang.

584

You took a bribe.

585

You signed a contract

with a cold chain company

587

that wasn't licensed,

588

that led to vaccine failures.

You also implicated
some innocent children.

How can you doubt me?

619
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,380

620

that he did take bribes.

621

was very attractive.
