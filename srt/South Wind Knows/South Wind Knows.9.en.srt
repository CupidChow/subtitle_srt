Bye-bye, my dear son.

192
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,340
Bye.

193
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,100
[Hope]

194
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,780
How do you feel today, deary?

195
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,020
How are you now, dear?

196
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:12,860
Come on.

197
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,780
Get this down.

198
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,100
Good boy.

199
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,060
Mint.

200
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,580
Professor.

201
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,540
What brings you here?

202
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,860
How's the situation here?

203
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,900
All we can do now

204
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,300
is to alleviate their symptoms.

205
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,140
Professor.

206
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,220
Don't worry.

207
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,300
Yunshen is negotiating with the company

208
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,860
for the use of Perdo.

209
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,460
Let's wait to hear from him.

210
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,980
It must be hard for Mr. Fu.

211
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,380
I'll get back to work, then.

212
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,580
Why are you outside?

213
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,620
You need to rest.

214
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,940
I'm out for groceries.

215
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,620
I'm going to prepare dinner
for my grandpa.

216
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,420
Show me your face.

217
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,380
You've lost weight again.

218
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,700
Look at these.

219
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,700
It's been a while

220
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,500
since you last saw
fresh vegetables and fruits, right?

221
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,020
Yeah.

222
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,140
I miss them so much.

223
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,060
You do?

224
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,100
Come back, then.

225
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,180
I'll fix some food for you.

226
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,420
Really?

227
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,660
I haven't been back to Shanghai
in a long time.

228
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,820
I miss my grandma.

229
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,140
So come back.

230
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,900
Oh, I forgot about this.

231
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,540
I'm returning to Heidelberg tomorrow.

232
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,540
Sure.

233
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,540
I'll fly to Heidelberg
after everything here is done.

234
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,140
Keep your word.

235
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,660
I need to get back to work now.

236
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,580
OK. Bye.

237
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,740
Bye-bye.

238
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,140
Yunshen.

239
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
What are you doing here?

240
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,100
Grandpa.

241
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,420
Don't stay in the kitchen.
It'll be done soon.

242
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,380
You know what?

243
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,300
I've learned how to cook
braised fish lately.

244
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,420
I was waiting for you to come home
and fix one for you.

245
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,940
Braised fish?

246
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,740
Oh, that won't do.

247
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,820
You must try mine first.

248
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,140
Well, fine.

249
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,980
You were starved
when you were trapped in the pit for days.

250
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,860
You look skinnier.

251
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,460
No, it's not that.

252
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,780
I learned some dishes
when I was in Country M.

253
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,820
- Grandpa, come on.
- No.

254
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,740
You should leave instead.

255
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,940
Put that down.

256
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,780
Hold on.

257
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,780
It's done soon.

258
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,820
What's the hurry?

259
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,420
Stop here.

260
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,380
Turn off the heat.

261
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,620
- Put them here.
- Well.

262
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,860
Go. Go out now.

263
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,340
Go now.

264
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,420
Okay, I'll go.

265
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,180
I'll leave it to you.

266
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,900
Um, onion, ginger, and garlic.

267
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,620
Good.

268
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,460
Let's do it.

269
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,620
Yunshen.

270
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,020
Your cooking skills seem to
have turned bad

271
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,940
after this trip.

272
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,060
My cooking skills have turned bad?

273
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,380
How can you tell about that

274
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,780
without tasting my dishes

275
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,980
and only by looking at them?

276
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,900
You don't appreciate my effort?

277
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,580
No, you can taste my fish first.

278
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,860
I specially made this for you.
Have a taste.

279
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,700
Fine, perhaps you're right.

280
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,460
Let's exchange our dishes.

281
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,060
Grandpa, here.

282
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,540
No, no.

283
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,420
Taste this.

284
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,980
I'm old already.

285
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,340
I can eat less.

286
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,940
You should eat the dishes.

287
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,060
No.

288
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,780
I made these for you.

289
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,620
Why?

290
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,180
Is there anything on your mind?

291
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,260
You can tell me.

292
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,980
Grandpa.

293
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,100
I want to stop the Perdo Project.

294
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,340
What's your reason?

295
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,540
On my trip to look for the plant,

296
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,660
I went to villages and tribes
in Country M.

297
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,260
Children over there

298
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,780
suffer from a congenital disease.

299
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,180
They never make it to adulthood.

300
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,580
But, we found that the extract
from Perdo

301
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,460
may cure this disease.

302
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,060
So,

303
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,340
I want to share a portion
of the herb harvesting rights

304
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,860
with Professor Hans
for his drug research.

305
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,220
Yunshen.

306
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,140
Being ideal isn't a bad thing.

307
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,620
But idealism alone
can't get things done.

308
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,900
Plus,

309
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,700
the company is facing
financial problems.

310
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,540
The situation is more complicated
than you imagine.

311
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,380
Grandpa.

312
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,330
The reason why I stepped into
drug development

313
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:49,820
in the first place

314
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,620
is to save lives.

315
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,180
Currently, Perdo

316
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,820
is the sole hope for those kids.

317
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,260
Grandpa.

318
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,100
Moreover, we can

319
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,260
collaborate with Professor Hans's lab

320
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,500
to develop a targeted drug

321
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,780
and bring it to the market.

322
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,420
Well,

323
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,900
this is huge.

324
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,300
I can't make the decision

325
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,500
on my own.

326
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,420
If you can convince the board

327
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,780
and get their approval,

328
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,540
I'll support you.

329
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,580
Do you mean it?

330
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,860
Yes.

331
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,260
All right.

332
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,180
Let's eat up.

333
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,820
Here, eat the fish.

334
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,460
Uh... The fish...

335
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,060
The fish is too burnt.

336
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,900
How are we going to eat this?

337
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,140
Not my fault.

338
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,900
The wok is a bad one.

339
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980
The heat was too strong.

340
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,980
The wok isn't good.

341
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,860
Why are you blaming the wok?

342
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,620
You've changed many woks, Grandpa.

343
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,620
(I wasn't using this wok before.)

344
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,500
Hello.

345
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,820
Hello, Mint.

346
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,460
We're going to observe
a clinical operation today.

347
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,140
Will you attend it?

348
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,580
What time is it?

349
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,780
Can I make it if I go now?

350
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,220
Yeah.

351
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,860
Be on your way now.

352
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,940
Okay, I'll be there soon.

353
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,960
The patient has been diagnosed
with Mitral Valve Stenosis

354
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,780
half a year ago.

355
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,820
Three months ago,
the patient underwent angioplasty surgery

356
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,540
but had serious complications.

357
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,580
(Today, the patient is undergoing
valve replacement.)

358
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,740
Hello, sir.

359
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,340
I'm the intern doctor here.

360
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,900
Are you the attending doctor?

361
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,140
I have some questions.

362
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,940
It's not me.

363
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,700
He just left.

364
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,860
That's him.

365
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,540
Thank you.

366
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,900
Hello, sir.

367
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,300
I have some questions...

368
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,140
Mint?

369
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,180
Dr. Ji, it's you.

370
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,300
I told you we'd meet again.

371
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,380
You predicted this.

372
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,820
Let's talk in my office.

373
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,620
Come on.

374
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,220
Look.

375
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,180
I made some notes.

376
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,820
Are you happy to see me?

377
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,100
Of course.

378
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,300
It's two o'clock over there.

379
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,220
Why are you still up?

380
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,940
I'm not tired.

381
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,140
I want to chat with you.

382
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,940
It must be tough for you

383
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,300
because of Perdo, right?

384
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,660
Not really. It's not that tiring.

385
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,780
Things are going on pretty smoothly.

386
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,820
Just wait to hear from me.

387
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,140
All right.

388
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,700
You look happy.

389
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,980
Any good news you want to share with me?

390
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,940
I met an old acquaintance today.

391
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,220
You know this person.

392
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,140
Take a guess.

393
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,220
Well, let me guess.

394
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,540
Anson.

395
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,340
It's Dr. Ji.

396
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,660
He's my superior.

397
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,260
Why is he everywhere?

398
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,420
Look at your sour face.

399
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,580
It must be sour enough
for the dumpling's vinegar.

400
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,820
You should come back to Shanghai
if you want dumplings.

401
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,540
I'll make some for you.

402
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,060
No.

403
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,740
My first choice

404
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,660
is little wontons made by my grandma.

405
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,140
Your dumplings will have to wait.

406
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,940
I want little wontons too.

407
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,660
Come back to me.

408
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,380
I'll think about it.

409
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,820
All right.

410
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,060
You should go to sleep now.

411
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,740
Your dark circles
are heavier than pandas'.

412
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,580
Good night.

413
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,340
Okay.

414
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,980
I'm going to bed, then.

415
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,140
Bye-bye.

416
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,300
Good night.

417
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,820
Is she pretty?

418
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,900
She's pretty, right?

419
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,940
Prettier than you.

420
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,420
Xizhou.

421
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,300
Xizhou.

422
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,100
You used to do well in fencing.

423
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,060
The work has been keeping me busy.

424
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,860
I can't help it.

425
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,500
We haven't had a spar in a long time.

426
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,780
Xizhou. I made this proposal.

427
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,420
I've analyzed

428
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,900
the commercial value
of immunologic drugs.

429
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,620
In the long run,

430
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,780
this project may not be inferior
to Perdo.

431
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,020
Have a look.

432
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,940
Has Grandpa read this yet?

433
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,900
Not yet.

434
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,700
What about those shareholders?

435
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,940
You're the first one.

436
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,620
Yunshen.

437
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,340
I don't have a say in this.

438
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,700
I think

439
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,020
you should show this to Grandpa
and the shareholders first.

440
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,020
Their opinions are more important
than mine.

441
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,460
We should go now.

442
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,540
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

443
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,060
Mr. Du

444
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,540
I suggest you read this.

445
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,100
This project...

446
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,780
- This project is truly...
- Yunshen.

447
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,900
Stop following me.

448
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,380
Well...

449
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,900
Mr. Du, wait...

450
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,500
Mr. Liu.

451
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,820
Morning.

452
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,260
You're jogging early in the morning.

453
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,220
Mr. Liu.

454
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
This is my latest proposal.

455
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,180
Would you like to have a look?

456
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,660
Did you know

457
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,060
why I jog on chilly mornings?

458
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,020
Because I can only free my mind

459
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,340
when I'm jogging.

460
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,820
I want to free my mind.

461
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,100
Got it?

462
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,380
Stop following me.

463
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,980
Wait, Mr. Liu...

464
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,420
Boss.

465
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,020
I rushed hot-footed back from Country M.

466
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,020
You should've let me do this...

467
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,660
Boss.

468
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,860
We've finished bathing.

469
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,860
Here, let's put on your dress.

470
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,300
Here.

471
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,660
Come on.

472
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,500
Oh, you're here too.

473
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,180
Yunshen.

474
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,220
Why?

475
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,580
You bring your dog for bathing too?

476
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,300
Yeah.

477
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,980
You have a handsome dog.

478
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,140
Your little furball is adorable too.

479
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,820
Yes, it's a cutie.

480
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,260
Yunshen.

481
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,020
You're here for me, aren't you?

482
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,140
Yes.

483
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,580
Mr. Wang.

484
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,900
I have a proposal here.
I'd like you to take a look at it.

485
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,020
Sure.

486
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,060
Go ahead and show me.

487
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:31,620
Here.

488
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,900
I've read it.

489
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,860
So fast?

490
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,780
Mr. Wang.

491
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,460
What do you think of this proposal?

492
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,020
It's too rigid.

493
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,140
It doesn't touch people.

494
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,900
It doesn't touch people?

495
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,900
Exactly.

496
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,300
You should put in some emotion.

497
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,780
And...

498
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,500
Gosh, it's dirty here.

499
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,140
I need to wash my dog once more.

500
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,580
You can figure this out yourself.

501
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,300
Mr. Wang.

502
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,500
You...

503
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,420
Mint?

504
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,180
Perfect timing.

505
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,780
Look at this.

506
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,780
What do you think of it?

507
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,380
Aren't they beautiful?

508
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,460
Don't you think they're scary too?

509
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,740
Scary?

510
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,900
How can they be scary?

511
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,020
Don't you find their beauty

512
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,660
pure?

513
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,620
Do you mean that
if we can't conquer them,

514
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,460
they will conquer us?

515
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,980
Stop being a spoilsport, will you?

516
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,140
Okay,

517
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,780
I take back my word.

518
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,380
Brief me about the lines and emotions.

519
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,620
I'll act it once again.

520
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,260
Forget it.

521
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,620
It's like I'm talking to a brick wall.

522
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,780
Well, let's get down to business.

523
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,300
Have you discovered
the nature of the virus

524
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,100
extracted from Ninggu Village?

525
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,180
When can we conquer it?

526
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,460
As of now, we've already extracted
the effective compound

527
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,980
from Perdo.

528
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,620
Through scaffold hopping,

529
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,220
it's connected with
other pharmacophores.

530
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,580
And we've found a suitable choice

531
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,700
that can produce new drug molecules.

532
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,140
During the process of finding
suitable pharmacophores,

533
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,660
we need a large amount of Perdo

534
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,300
for a lot of trial and error.

535
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,820
However, the Perdo supply we have
in the lab

536
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,140
can't afford this.

537
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,340
We'll work this out somehow.

538
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,340
It's said that
Perdo herb harvesting rights

539
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,660
have been acquired
by a pharmaceutical company.

540
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,060
Will they really give up
on a lucrative business

541
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,220
and collaborate with us?

542
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,820
Yes, they will.

543
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,580
Someone gave me his word.

544
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,900
I have faith in him.

545
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,020
Today, I'll take you to meet

546
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,780
the legendary genius on our campus.

547
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,100
But you've been calling yourself
a genius.

548
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,180
Well, he's just as good as me.

549
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,100
Careful.

550
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,580
Dr. Ji.

551
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,420
Mint.

552
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,140
Wait...

553
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,020
You two know each other.

554
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,220
Certainly.

555
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,260
You said the person was a genius.

556
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,900
I thought it was some mysterious figure.

557
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,020
Is beer okay?

558
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,580
Two beers.

559
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,900
What a small world.

560
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,500
Let's give a toast to the geniuses here.

561
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,140
Come on.

562
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,060
We have three here.

563
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:18,740
Cheers.

564
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,980
- What are the odds?
- Cheers.

565
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,300
Mom.

566
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,460
I heard

567
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,420
that you've been visiting every director
on the list,

568
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,580
but nothing turned out well.

569
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,260
No.

570
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,140
They said they would think about it.

571
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,660
They were pretty kind to me.

572
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,980
They laughed at you behind your back
and teased you

573
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,060
that you were incapable of taking over
Lingtian Pharmaceutical Group.

574
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,020
All I wish

575
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,940
is to let those kids have a better life.

576
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,700
As for what they said about me,

577
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,820
I don't care.

578
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,140
How are you going to take over
the company

579
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,900
if they lose their trust in you?

580
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,500
You're giving Lingtian away

581
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,900
to Fu Xizhou.

582
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,860
Mom.

583
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,020
I'm not interested in
managing the company.

584
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,700
Xizhou is part of the Fus too.

585
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,500
He's entitled to inherit the company.

586
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,260
If he were to take over this company,

587
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,260
do you think

588
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,260
you could still stay in the lab?

589
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,140
Mom.

590
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,420
Xizhou isn't that kind of person.

591
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,860
You're too naive.

592
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:15,780
Mr. Fu.

593
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,020
How's it?

594
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,260
Both major shareholders, Mr. Gu,
and Mr. Zhou,

595
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,140
haven't taken any stand yet,

596
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,140
so the other shareholders
are still watching.

597
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,900
But they're inclined to side with us.

598
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,620

Since we have the same goal,

664
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,740
we should share the resources we have.

00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,780
I know my situation very well.

758
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,700
Although I really hope
to get their support,

759
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,580
I can't trade this

760
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,500
with my own feelings.

761
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,420
I have respect for my own feelings

762
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,860
and yours.

763
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,900
No, it's not that, Yunshen.

764
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,500
I never wanted you

765
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,980
to trade this help with your heart.

766
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,980
- I know.
- I...

767
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,540
You're a fine woman.

768
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:27,980
But now

769
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,740
I have someone in my heart.

770
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,260
Stop wasting your time on me.

771
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,020
Get home safely.

772
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,220
Let me show you your future mother.

773
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,500
You scared me.

774
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,740
I thought it was a call
from the hospital.

775
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,420
You rested up earlier today.

776
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,100
I have been working
for the past 48 hours.

777
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,460
That's why I got tired early.

778
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,420
What?

779
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,780
Forty-eight hours.

780
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,460
This is horrible.

781
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,140
Resign from the hospital now

782
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:32,900
and come back to Shanghai.

783
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,860
Do what I say.

784
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,140
It's the same case in any hospital.

785
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,500
It should be three

786
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,820
over there, right?

787
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,100
Why haven't you slept yet?

788
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,940
I'm working on my proposal now.

789
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,900
I took a nap at noon.

790
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,780
I'm not sleepy now.

791
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,500
