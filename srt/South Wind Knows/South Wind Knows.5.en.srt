00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,380
I have only cooked for two people

25
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,900

One of them

27
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,420
is my grandpa.

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,460
Your grandma.

30
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,060
Just joking.

31
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,780
The noodles taste nice.

32
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,700
Thank you.

33
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,780
Boss.

34
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,740
I might...

35
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,540
I might die soon.

37
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,260

Le.

41
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,660
What happened to you?

42
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,740
I'm suffering from vomiting and diarrhea.

43
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,180
I don't feel better even after drinking
the herbal medicine that Boss gave me.

44
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,700
I vomited even more.

45
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,380
I feel this place is not suitable for me.

46
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,700
It's incompatible with me by nature.

47
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,940
Did you drink it?

48
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,940
Yes.

49
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,700
I drank all the herbal medicine.

50
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,860

53
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,180
Sorry, Le.

54
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,460
I didn't know you had such a low EQ.

55
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,940
Even your IQ is also low.

56
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,420
I'll keep the bank card.

57
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,420
I remember the password as well.

58
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,780
Boss. Boss.

59
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,100
Could you return the card to me?

Boss.

Why are you smiling? I told you just now.

66

Don't touch me.

Going into the mountains
during the monsoon season is a taboo.

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,300
I don't think the Chief
will come out to meet you.

75
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,580
Fine.

76
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,580
We'll go ourselves.

77
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,220
We can go ourselves.

Since you haven't recovered,

80
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,380
you should rest here.

81
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,700
Don't go to the mountains with us.

82
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,620
No!

83
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,460
Boss.

84
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,100
I must go with you.

85
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,420
I'm worried about you, Boss.

86
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,740
Well, Dr. Zhu.

87
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,820
Why don't you stay here, too?

88
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,540
Look at me. I'm so weak now.

89
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,700
I need someone to take care of me, right?

90
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,940
Don't worry.

91
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,300
I've prepared the medicine for you.

92
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,620
Take it on time, and you'll recover.

93
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,900
Remember to take it based on my advice.

94
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,540
All right?

95
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,380
No.

96
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,620
If you're not here, I won't remember it.

97
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,540
You must stay here and take care of me.

98
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,500
Keep an eye on me.

99
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,180
- Boss.
- If you want to go without me,

100
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,580
you'd better depart now.

101
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,300
Okay.

102
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,580
Boss.

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,060
Goodbye.

105
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,300
Just lie down.

106
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,140
Goodbye.

107
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,260

109

Boss.

110
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,620
Dr. Zhu.

111
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,780
Stay safe!

112
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,740
Come back safely!

113
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,020
It's cold up there; keep warm!

114
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,700
Don't get bitten by insects!

115
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,740
Watch your steps.

116
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,300
Okay.

117
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,660
Be careful.

118
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,740
Sure.

119
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,860
Be careful.

120
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,420
Come.

121
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,380
What's wrong?

122
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,380
Do you feel unwell?

123
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,580
I'm okay.

124
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,540
It's no big deal.

125
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,020
Sen.

126
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
How do you feel now?

127
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,820
Don't pretend to be tough.

128
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,460
I feel suffocated

129
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,420
and have a mild headache.

130
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,220
It's altitude sickness.

131
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,700
It's mild.

132
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,180
I didn't know we'd
come to such a high place,

133
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,380
so I didn't bring any medicine.

134
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,380
Take this.

135
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,340
What's this?

136
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,100
It can save your life.

137
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,900
Is it reliable?

138
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,700
It's rhodiola.

139
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,220
This medicine is fine.

140
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:42,980
Eat it.

141
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,300
Come on, Mr. Fu.

142
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,300
Thank you.

143
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,060
Sen.

144
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,220
Let's take a break

145
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,540
since he's quite sick.

146
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,620
Sure.

147
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,100
I'll head ahead

148
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,940
and see if there are any places
suitable for camping.

149
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,420
Okay.

150
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,100
The altitude here is not too high.

151
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,220
You've just taken the medicine,

152
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,340
and you should feel better in no time.

153
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,140
Don't worry.

154
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,220
Do you still want some water?

155
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:40,900
No.

156
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,660
You can have it.

157
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,660
It's very foggy now,

158
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,620
and there are many forked roads ahead.

159
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,740
You must stay close to me.

160
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,660
Don't get lost.

161
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,780
How are you feeling?

162
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,580
I'm okay.

163
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,180
Sen!

164
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,060
Wait for us!

165
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,020
How are you?

166
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,580
Be careful.

167
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,020
Are you okay?

168
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,820
I'm fine.

169
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,780
Let's go.

170
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,580
Sen!

171
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,020
Sen!

172
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,460
I'm here!

173
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,940
Sen!

174
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,780
There's no point shouting.

175
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,980
There are many forked roads,

176
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,300
and it's so foggy now.

177
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,260
Let's make a mark here.

178
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,180
Okay.

179
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,220
It's getting dark.

180
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,380
It'll be colder and colder.

181
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,460
We have to find a place
to set up the tents.

182
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,500
What are you doing?

183
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,820
To prevent us from getting separated.

184
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,660
Let's go.

185
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,220
Okay.

186
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,700
Ghost!

187
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,860
Fu Yunshen.

188
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,620
You're in the scientific research field.

189
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,900
Why are you so superstitious?

190
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,100
I was just saying hello to it.

191
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,580
Stay close to me.

192
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,380
Don't get lost.

Come here!

262
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:22,980
Be careful.

263
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,620
Ouch, it hurts.

264
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,820
Hold on.

265
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,380
I've warned you.

266
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,700
Can't you speak faster?

267
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,300
Shut up.

268
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,220
Is anyone there?

269
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,820
Slowly.

270
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,540
Oh no.

271
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,140
We'll never get out.

272
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,260
I'm doomed.

273
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,260
I haven't had the chance

274
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,660
to spend my hard-earned money
with my grandma.

275
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,900
Now,

276
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,220
there's only one solution.

277
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,740
What is it?

278
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,340
Wait for it to get sunnier

279
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,820
so that the flares can be dried.

280
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,780
Eat something.

281
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,460
I'm not hungry.

282
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,900
Let's not eat first.

283
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,380
Our stuff is all in Sen's backpack.

284
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,540
It's not sure when we can be rescued.

285
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Just save it first.

286
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,020
Why are you so emotional?

287
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,460
Here.

288
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,380
Get some energy.

289
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,020
I've peeled them for you.

290
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,380
Don't worry.

291
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,460
We can definitely go out alive.

292
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,300
Fu Yunshen.

293
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,340
Actually,

294
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,020
I really quite admire you.

295
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,380
You're the most optimistic person
I've ever met.

296
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,900
I'm not being optimistic.

297
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,180
I'm so important.

298
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,540
When Chen Le realizes that I'm missing,

299
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,860
he'll inform my brother immediately.

300
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,820
When my brother knows that I'm missing,

301
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,820
he'll use every way to find me.

302
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,620
Don't worry.

303
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,060
If you stay with me,

304
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,220
it'll benefit you

305
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,380
because you'll be safe.

306
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,540
Don't you believe me?

307
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,500
I do.

308
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,300
Thank you.

309
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,620
You are injured.

310
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,020
I'm fine.

311
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,220
It's just a minor injury.

312
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,740
Come.

313
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,740
Don't move.

314
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,020
You don't have to do this.

315
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,260
Don't blow at me.

316
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,780
It's almost done.

317
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,900
- Stop blowing!
- Do you want to recover?

318
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,420
You're talking so much.

319
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,060
You're spraying spittle on me.

320
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,820
I'm just treating your wound.

321
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,980
Why do you complain so much?

322
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,140
Luckily, it's not serious.

323
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,940
I'm almost done.

324
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,660
It's so foggy here.

325
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,220
Plus, it rained just now.

326
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,380
Chen Le might not be able to find us.

327
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,820
Don't worry.

328
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,420
My mother once told me my fortune.

329
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,860
I can live for at least 99 years.

330
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,180
We've finished all the food.

331
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,580
How is it possible to live for 99 years?

332
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,940
Oh no.

333
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,420
Are they your parents?

334
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,660
You take after your mother
when she was young.

335
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,020
Yes.

336
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,540
Many people said that too.

337
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,060
I've been wanting to ask you,

338
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,660
but I didn't have the chance to.

339
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,420
Since we have so much time now,

340
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,580
just ask me.

341
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,100
What is it?

342
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,500
When you heard the gunshot that day,

343
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,980
why didn't you run away?

344
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,020
Weren't you scared?

345
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,260
Actually,

346
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,020
I was too scared.

347
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,020
That was why I couldn't move.

348
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:41,940
Um...

349
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,820
Did you have

350
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,420
some bad experiences before?

351
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,380
I'm sorry.

352
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,260
I'm not nosy,

353
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,060
but you looked unwell the other day,

354
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,260
so I'm a little worried.

355
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,780
If you don't want to talk about it,

356
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,100
it's fine.

357
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,020
Where did you

358
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,060
hide the person you saved?

359
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,860
I told you

360
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,300
I'm just a doctor.

361
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,860
I save lives and treat injuries.

362
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,340
The patient's whereabouts
have nothing to do with me.

363
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,580
I'll ask you once more.

364
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,860
Where did you hide that person?

365
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,540
I don't know.

366
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,580
Dad!

367
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
What's happening out there?

368
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,500
Zhu Jiu.

369
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
I'm bringing you to a place.

370
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,140
Come, follow me.

371
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,540
Wear your shoes.

372
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,380
Let's go.

373
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,580
Let's go.

374
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,380
Dad.

375
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,500
This way.

376
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,420
This way. Follow me.

377
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:05,820
Come.

378
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,180
Zhu Jiu.

379
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,220
Dad.

380
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,460
Let's play

381
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,100
your favorite game, hide-and-seek.

382
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,180
I don't want to.

383
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:16,980
Listen.

384
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,980
I'll ask your mom to look for you, okay?

385
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,980
Start counting in your mind.

386
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,620
Count from zero to a hundred.

387
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,940
If she hasn't found you
after you finish counting,

388
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,380
you must not come out.

389
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,740
You'll lose if you come out.

390
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,460
- Dad.
- All right.

391
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,860
Let's start the game now.

392
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,060
Go and hide now.

393
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,140
Hurry up. Go and hide.

394
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,660
Quick.

395
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,380
Dad.

396
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,980
Do not come out, all right?

397
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,780
Dad.

398
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,860
Dad.

399
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,700
Dad.

400
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,340
So I kept waiting for my mother.

401
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,660
A long time seemed to have passed.

402
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,620
Then, I fell asleep.

403
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,620
I heard Uncle Hans

404
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,900
calling my name frantically.

405
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,740
Then I came out from the large bucket.

406
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,660
At that time,

407
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,260
it was dawn already.

408
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,820
Mint!

409
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,540
Mint!

410
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,580
Mint!

411
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,140
Mint!

412
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,700
- Are you hurt?
- Uncle Hans!

413
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,860
Uncle Hans!

414
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,900
Uncle Hans!

415
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,140
I'm here.

416
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,100
There, there.

417
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,700
Relax.

418
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,740
My mother was killed
by the anti-government mercenary

419
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,060
because she saved the army general
of the government forces.

420
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,940
As for my father...

421
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,420
In order to save me,

422
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,180
he drove

423
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,860
to a place far away to lure them.

424
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,100
Therefore, Naotao Village

425
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,740
and a few other villages

426
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,660
became the sacrifice
of the anti-government army.

427
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,940
I miss them very much.

428
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,780
I miss them

429
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,620
when I'm sad.

430
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,860
I miss them

431
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,420
when I'm happy.

432
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,180
I miss them when I wake up

433
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,980
in the morning.

434
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,420
I miss them

435
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,980
when I'm tired.

436
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,980
I miss them even

437
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,660
when I eat delicious food.

438
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,860
If they could sit in front of me,

439
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,100
how nice would it be?

440
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,420
Zhu Jiu.

441
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,820
Come.

442
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
Lean on my shoulder.

443
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,900
I'm okay.

444
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,180
It's all right.

445
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,660
Whenever I feel lonely,

446
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,300
whenever I think of my parents,

447
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,300
I lean on my grandpa's shoulder like this.

448
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,220
It makes me

449
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,340
feel warm.

450
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
My grandpa

451
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,140
is a great man.

452
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,500
Fu Yunshen.

453
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,100
Thank you.

454
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,180
Fu Yunshen.

455
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:45,940
What's wrong?

456
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,140
The...

457
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,060
The light is off.

458
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,220
Don't be scared.

459
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,100
I'm right here.

460
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,700
Are you feeling cold?

461
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,700
The torch burned out.

462
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,100
Are you done?

463
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,020
Almost.

464
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,820
Come.

465
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,300
It's warm.

466
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,620
Don't worry.

467
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,540
Zhu Jiu.

468
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,780
Take a deep breath.

469
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,380
Look.

470
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,100
It's not dark anymore.

471
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,500
Do you feel better now?

472
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,740
Yes.

473
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,860
It's brighter now, right?

474
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,340
This little fan is quite useful.

475
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,620
Aren't you going to apologize to it?

476
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:37,900
Look.

477
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,340
It blew the darkness away.

478
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,340
Isn't it great?

479
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,180
Thank you, little fan.

480
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,380
You've been of great help.

481
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,580
What's this?

482
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,460
Hello.

483
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,140
I'm Zhu Jiu's good friend for many years.

484
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,180
My name is Joy.

485
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,900
So you've been her good friend,

486
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,380
Miss Joy.

487
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,900
Hello, Miss Joy.

488
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,620
Hi.

489
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,420
When I was young,

490
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,660
my mother gave me this
as my birthday gift.

491
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,620
It has accompanied me for many years.

492
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,660
Miss Joy.

493
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,980
Judging by your look, I doubt

494
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,740
the number of baths you've taken

495
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,740
over these years.

496
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,620
Well.

497
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,700
I have a good buddy.

498
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,620
It's him.

499
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,940
Now, I'm calling him

500
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,660
the handshake ambassador.

501
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,180
It doesn't have hands,

502
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,180
but its ears can do the job.

503
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,380
Hello.

504
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,260
- Let's shake hands.
- Hello.

505
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,100
You are really something.

506
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,700
Handshake ambassador.

507
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,820
It's newly hired.

508
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,340
It has a better price-performance ratio
than the others in the market.

509
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,380
It's a good deal.

510
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,940
Look, it's even...

511
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,660
Multifunctional.

512
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,220
There's a light on this side.

513
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,940
On this side...

514
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,900
Why is the wind getting stronger?

515
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,460
Chen Le

516
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,700
is quite awesome.

517
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,900
Take a nap if you feel tired.

518
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:53,820
Stop messing around!

519
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,900
Step aside!

520
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,420
Stop messing around!

521
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,020
- Go back!
- Let go of me!

522
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,460
- Let go of me!
- Sit down!

523
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,460
Let go of me!

524
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,660
Sit down!

525
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,700
The Chief has already warned us
that it's dangerous

526
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,220
to go into the mountains
during the monsoon season.

527
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,540
There are already two people missing.

528
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,660
He can't afford
to put his people in danger.

529
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,300
Don't worry.

530
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,060
There must be some other ways.

531
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,020
Let's brainstorm together.

532
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,500
Who is taking the satellite phone?

533
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,100
- Wallet.
- Phone!

534
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,820
Wallet.

535
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,620
Answer the phone.

536
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,180
Answer the phone.

537
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,820
Answer the phone.

538
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,500
Answer the phone!

539
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,380
Zhu Jiu.

540
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,340
Look up.

541
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,340
Can you see that?

542
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,460
I heard

543
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,740
people who passed away

544
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,740
would become stars

545
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,900
to protect their loved ones.

546
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,300
Your parents

547
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,380
must be

548
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,820
the two brightest stars in the sky.

549
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,940
They will protect you forever.

550
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,500
So, you don't have
to be afraid of darkness.

551
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,340
Because

552
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,100
the darker it is,

553
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,820
the brighter they'll shine at you.

554
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,860
Are they

555
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,020
the two stars?

556
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,140
Of course.

557
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,300
Furthermore,

558
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,340
I even heard what they said to me.

559
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,540
What did they tell you?

560
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,700
They said,

561
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,420
"Why is the young man beside our daughter

562
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,700
so handsome?"

563
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,140
They are so beautiful.

564
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,260
How nice if I could bring them with me.

565
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,100
Give me your hand.

566
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,020
Tell you what.

567
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,180
I'm not only handsome

568
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,620
but also very talented.

569
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:47,980
Look.

570
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,660
I'm going to draw
this one and only watch for you.

571
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,380
One star.

572
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,620
Two stars.

573
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,220
Three stars.

574
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,900
Four stars.

575
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,300
Five stars.

576
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,980
These are all stars.

577
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,300
Draw a big star in the center.

578
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,660
This big star is Zhu Jiu.

579
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,220
Mint.

580
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,980
Zhu Jiu is the strongest

581
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,380
and the most resilient girl.

582
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,380
So, this watch

583
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,380
is for you.

584
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,500
It's called the One and Only Watch.

585
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,580
By wearing it,

586
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,820
you'll be a super-duper great universe.

587
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,980
You won't be scared of anything.

588
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:40,900
How is it?

589
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,740
Does it look nice?

590
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,860
Cover it.

591
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,780
Make sure it doesn't
get soaked in the rain.

592
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,860
Thank you.

593
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,940
This is the best gift I've ever received.

594
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,020
You're welcome.

595
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:09,860
Are you okay?

596
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,300
I'm fine.

597
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,100
Put it on.

598
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,660
Let's share it.

599
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,700
Okay.

600
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,300
We're considered

601
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,660
partners who've been
through adversity together.

602
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,180
We'll definitely get out.

603
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,220
It's just a matter of time.

604
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,740
Fu Yunshen.

605
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,940
I also have a present for you.

606
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,140
What is it?

607
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,660
Zhu Jiu.

608
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,580
How dare you
hide such a good thing from me?

609
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,980
This is the only food we still have.

610
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,420
If you'd seen it earlier,

611
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,740
it would've been eaten already.

612
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,060
Are you sure it would've been eaten?

613
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,460
Am I that stingy?

614
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,380
Do I look like a chowhound?

615
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,580
Eat it.

616
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,260
I wanted to give it to you.

617
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,060
Zhu Jiu.

618
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:35,980
Zhu Jiu.

619
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,580
