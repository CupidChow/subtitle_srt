00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,910
What do you want from me?

375
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,910
You have two choices:

376
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,030
first,

377
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,230
turn yourself in,

378
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,870
and your wife and kid

379
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,870
will be well taken care of;

380
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,550
second,

381
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,430
I can call the police right now,

382
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,630
and from now on,

383
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,750
everything you do
has nothing to do with me.

384
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:08,870
Mr. Fu,

385
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,950
thank you for your cooperation.

386
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,670
We will keep in touch.

387
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,710
Alright, thank you.

388
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,630
You're welcome.

389
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,030
Boss,

390
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,750
how did you know
that Jiang Jun would come to the hospital?

391
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,750
His only redeeming quality

392
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,790
is that he loves his wife.

393
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,390
His wife is having a C-section today.

394
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,070
Well, in that sense,

395
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,190
he's not that hopeless.

396
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,590
Boss,

397
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,470
you have no idea

398
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,950
how worried I was

399
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,190
when I was waiting in the car.

400
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,630
What's there to worry about?

401
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,950
Jiang Jun is no threat.

402
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,270
I was mainly worried

403
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,990
that he would recognize
the person in the video was me.

404
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,070
With my tall and sturdy figure,

405
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,710
and outstanding bearing,
so different from the norm,

406
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,470
how could he not have had any suspicion?

407
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,910
Because people with a guilty conscience

408
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,470
will naturally admit when facing a bluff.

409
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,470
I think it's mainly because
I have great acting skills.

410
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:02,990
Boss,

411
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,270
I hope to get an award this year,

412
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,670
Lingtian's Best Actor.

413
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,470
You don't need to get me a trophy;

414
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,030
more bonuses will do.

415
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,510
Sure.

416
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,150
But Chen Le,

417
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,950
what I'm more concerned about is,

418
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,590
were you just being yourself?

419
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,230
The wine, coffee machine, and chocolate

420
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,830
my friends gave me

421
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,790
often go missing.

422
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,430
Can you help me find them?

423
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,670
Boss!

424
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,910
The blow to Jiang Shuning this time
is quite big.

425
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,390
Fu Lingtian is still in a coma.

426
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,030
It's like even God
is giving us opportunities.

427
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:42,750
Come on,

00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,710

However,

430
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,990
I don't think Jiang Shuning
will be in jail for long,

431
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,310
so we must act fast.

432
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,110

433
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,110
we've been operating for so long

434
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,350
and invested so much.

435
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,950
You can't waver
at such a critical juncture.

436
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,070
Otherwise, we won't be able

437
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,470
to answer to the investment banks

438
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,230
and investors we are working with.

439
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:08,830
I won't.

440
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,110
That's my good buddy.

441
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,590
Is the agreement ready?

442
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,110
Of course.

443
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,670
But are we really leaving Zhou and Gu out?

444
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,550
After all, they are the biggest
shareholders outside of the Fu family.

445
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,310
My father-in-law,

446
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,830
I mean Mr. Gu,

447
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,310
is probably very mad at me now.

448
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,950
He won't agree to see me.

449
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,070
How does that saying go?

450
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,470
A son-in-law is like half a son.

451
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,430
For his daughter's sake,

452
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,710
Gu Changlin will not be unfair to you.

but if anything unexpected
happens in the future,

455
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,390
we can deal with it together.

456
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,390
I can try to convince Zhou.

457
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,030
Although he's always been
on Jiang Shuning's side,

458
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,190
he has never gotten what he wanted.

459
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,190
With such an unbalanced relationship,

460
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,470
he probably can't resist
short-term benefits.

461
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,070
Right,

462
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,070
I've met Mr. Liu and Mr. Wang.

463
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,790
They would love to work with us.

464
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,430
They were the ones
that worked for Grandpa for the longest.

465
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,070
So you see,

people are all the same,

467
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,830
self-interest above all.

However,

470
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,270
I have a concern:

471
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,190
what if Gu Changlin betrays you first?

472
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,110
What does it matter

00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,630
if he betrays me or not?

given the current situation,

00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,910
how do you think those old guys

00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,310

yet we've made it through steadily.

560
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,470
What's more, Lingtian

561
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,630
has its own
proprietary vaccine development

562
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,990
and a stable customer base.

563
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,430
So please don't be nervous, everyone.

564
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,030
We can understand your determination,

565
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,350
but

566
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,430
everyone knows

567
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,510
how to boost morale,

568
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,270
yet realizing gains is difficult.

569
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,790
Mr. Fu is considering us elders.

570
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,110
He doesn't want our lifetime of hard work

571
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,230
to go to waste.

572
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,950
We are old now

573
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,870
and can't take the ups and downs
and blows anymore.

574
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,310
That's right.

575
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,070
I've done my homework privately
about what you said.

576
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,230
Redstone's terms are indeed

577
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,670
a timely stop-loss for us.

578
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,430
Well, didn't Mr. Fu tell you?

579
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,630
His wife, Gu Ruanruan,

580
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,710
is also a shareholder of Redstone.

581
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,630
Fu Xizhou did this

582
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,270
behind Ruanruan's back.

583
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,470
Ruanruan divorced him
after finding out about this.

584
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,870
You all heard what Mr. Gu said.

585
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,870
Gu Ruanruan and I have divorced.

586
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,310
On a legal level,

587
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,550
I have no connections
with Redstone whatsoever.

588
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,470
But Mr. Fu Jr.,

589
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,230
what exactly is your purpose

590
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,030
to publicly reveal this?

591
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,950
What purpose can I have?

592
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,790
Why don't you
just be more straightforward?

593
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,190
Why are you beating around the bush?

594
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,830
Fu Xizhou,

595
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,470
what is your purpose exactly?

596
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,110
If it is really beneficial,

597
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:16,190
why did you gather us here privately?

598
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,110
Is Redstone's current strength

599
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,030
a fact?

600
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,590
Is Lingtian's current predicament a fact?

601
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,310
My divorce from Gu Ruanruan,

602
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,950
and how we handle our marital property,

603
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,510
that is my own private matter.

604
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,310
It won't affect the acquisition plan,

605
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,950
and even less will it affect
everyone's interests.

606
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,870
Please think it through clearly.

607
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,470
I'm doing this for all of you.

608
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:00,630
Mom.

609
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,470
Dad,

610
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,590
wake up!

611
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,750
Your favorite grandson is here to see you.

612
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,710
Mom, you should be resting at home.

613
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,030
Why did you come to the hospital?

614
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,510
I was worried about your grandpa.

615
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,990
I was too rash.

616
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,630
I should take part of the responsibility

617
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,110
for your grandfather's fainting.

618
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,230
Did you see

619
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,110
what Fu Xizhou has done today?

620
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,630
Fu Xizhou certainly
won't give away this opportunity.

621
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,990
If your grandfather wakes up

622
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,670
and the company is gone,

623
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,590
I really don't know how I would face him.

624
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,510
Then we can only change the plan

625
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,710
and dilute equity.

626
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,230
But Redstone would have anticipated this.

627
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,110
What if they come prepared?

628
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,830
So it depends
on how long their funding can last.

629
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,790
Also, the company's shareholders

630
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,910
have always prioritized self-interest.

631
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,510
They certainly won't support us
this time, either.

632
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,510
The only approach for now

633
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,190
is to take it one step at a time.

634
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,470
The company
is your grandfather's life's work.

635
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,990
Before he wakes up,

636
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,110
we must guard the company well for him.

637
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:25,510
I know.

638
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,030
I will contact
anti-takeover experts immediately.

639
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,030
