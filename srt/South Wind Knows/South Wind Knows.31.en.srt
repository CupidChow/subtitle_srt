This is our business.

187
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,830
You know my health conditions.

188
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,190
You mean the complications
after the surgery?

189
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,790
You already knew?

190
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,710
I was so worried about you.

191
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,190
But I couldn't see you.

192
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,350
So I went to ask your doctor-in-charge.

193
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,470
You're a doctor.

194
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,750

196
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,430
who may die any minute.

197
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,270
Being together with me

198
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,430
will only waste your time.

199
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,110
But nobody knows
what will happen in the future.

200
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,990
Can you not be so sure of it?

201
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,590
When I was in a coma,

202
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,270
I had a long dream.

203
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,310
I dreamt that we were married.

204
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,390
We had a baby.

205
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:55,870
We quarreled.

206
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,910
We fought.

207
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,590
Our hair turned gray.

208
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,470
Our teeth fell out.

209
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,230
Perhaps

210
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,630
I wanted such a life too much.

211
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,910
That's why I felt extremely sad

212
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,070
when I woke up

213
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,190
and realized I'd be gone

214
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,710
before you did,

215
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,470
and you'd bear these pains

216
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,830
all by yourself.

someone else.

220
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:54,910
This way,

221
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,310
you'll have a peaceful life.

222
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,990

we're clearly in love,
