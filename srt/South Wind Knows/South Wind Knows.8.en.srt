I'm sorry.

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,660
I was harsh towards you yesterday.

24
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,100
It's alright, Uncle Hans.

25
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,660
I know

26
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,900
it was because you weren't able

27
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,900
to say goodbye to them.

28
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,740
You don't have to comfort me.

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,660
I think you were right.

30
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,380
As a doctor,

31
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,180
I need to grow tougher.

Danmin's grandfather said

38
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,020
that death was a liberation for Danmin.

39
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,380
What made him sad was

40
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,500
that water cremation is the custom here.

41
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,500
But to avoid

I really want to give you
words of comfort,

wish to save those kids.

But...

71
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,500
I also wish to do something

72
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,620
that I can for this place.

73
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,140
I get it.

74
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,100
I don't know how to thank you

75
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,540
for everything you have done.

76
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,460
In that case, can you do me a favor?

77
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,140
Anything within my power.

82
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,220
Because there are more people here
who need you now.

83
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,540
Me too.

84
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,860

Look. We're still in one piece now.

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,020
I've got work to do.

95
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,100
Get some sleep.

96
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,860
I'm almost done discussing with Mr. Xie.

97
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,700
There are just some details left.

98
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,780
Good job.

99
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,620
Ms. Jiang.

100
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,980
Yunshen developed the project.

101
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,820
He found the plant.

102
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,100
Also, he was the one
who risked his life in Country M.

103
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,260
Xizhou.

104
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,380
Weren't you going to save my son?

105
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,860
Instead of bringing back my son,

106
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,620
you returned with a contract.

107
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,740
Yunshen can't come back
for the time being.

108
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,900
He needs to take care of something.

109
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,220
The contract with Mr. Xie was urgent,

110
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,820
so I came back first.

111
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,100
What are you doing here?

112
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,820
Yunshen refused to come back.

113
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,860
Was Xizhou supposed to abduct him
and put him on a plane?

114
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,660
He is his brother, not a kidnapper.

115
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,940
What kind of elder brother

116
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,460
takes credit
for his younger brother's achievement?

117
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,300
Dad.

118
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,260
Do you already have a successor in mind?

119
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,100
You may leave.

120
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,580
Yes, Grandpa.

121
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,420
Tell me.

122
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,140
If I were to hand over
the company to Yunshen,

123
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,820
is he willing to take it?

124
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,940
Of course, he would.

125
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,060
Hold on.

126
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,820
Let's be clear.

127
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,820
Is he willing to take it or is it you?

128
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,380
Dad.

129
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,100
What are you trying to say?

130
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,540
Shuning.

131
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,860
I may be old, but I am not foolish.

132
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,260
Since Yunshen first joined the company,

133
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,980
he devoted all his efforts

134
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,420
to research and development.

135
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,100
He never shows up
for the company's regular meetings.

136
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,620
That clearly shows
what he's interested in.

137
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,780
Now I'm letting Xizhou
share his workload.

138
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,620
Isn't that good?

139
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,780
Dad.

140
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,940
I just want to warn you.

141
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,060
Be careful not to raise a tiger.

142
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,900
Xizhou will find out eventually.

143
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,860
Shuning.

144
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,740
Don't speak out of line.

145
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,860
I'm just concerned for your sake.

146
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,140
Don't forget

147
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,820
where his mother is now.

148
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,660
On that note,

149
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,420
I'm really curious.

150
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,780
Since when do you care
about people's interests?

151
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,540
Get out.

152
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,020
Hello?

153
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,460
Okay, noted.

154
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,100
Mom.

155
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,260
Fu Rong.

156
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,620
I don't want a divorce.

157
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,940
Don't.

158
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,660
Let's run away with Xizhou, okay?

159
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,780
Everything is alright.

160
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,660
Don't cry.

161
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,900
(Don't worry.)

162
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,820
Your dad will take us inside.

163
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,660
Dad.

164
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,620
You're finally willing to see me.

165
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,660
Don't call me that.

166
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,020
You and Fu Rong are divorced.

167
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,740
Don't worry.

168
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,060
The child won't suffer in my home.

169
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,060
Dad.

170
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,260
Fu Rong met with us two days ago.

171
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,420
I have arranged for Fu Rong
to go to France.

172
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,700
Your elder brother is thirsty.

173
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,900
What will you do?

174
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,220
No!

175
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,100
Mom, I'm hungry.

176
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,380
Mom?

177
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,420
Mom.

178
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,060
Mom.

179
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,340
Mom?

180
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,020
What happened to you?

181
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,860
Why were you so careless?

182
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,140
- Done eating?
- Wipe your mouth.

183
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,660
Here, let me feed you.

184
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,300
Here, open your mouth.

185
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,780
Here, zip it up.

186
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,500
Don't catch a cold.

187
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,340
Come on.

188
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,620
Let's go buy toys later.

189
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,140
Watch your feet.

190
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,820
Dig in.

191
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,100
Dr. Sun.

192
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,180
Mr. Fu.

193
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,620
From what you've just described,

194
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,340
your mother's symptoms
are probably not signs of improvement.

195
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,820
Cognitive error

196
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,700
is also a symptom of schizophrenia.

197
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,860
Is it possible that she might

198
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,020
slowly recall other things?

199
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,940
After all, she spoke for the first time
in more than ten years.

200
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,780
She even remembered my name.

201
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,740
Dr. Sun.

202
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,260
What you said could be possible.

203
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,140
But we still need to observe further
to know her actual condition.

204
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,140
Try to communicate more with her.

205
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,700
However,

206
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,500
people with mental illness
often experience hallucinations.

207
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,660
Sometimes, they may say

208
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,860
what they assume is the truth,

209
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,900
but the truth isn't the case.

210
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,700
I suggest

211
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,300
you try to find out

212
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,940
the real reason that triggered
your mother's illness.

213
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,140
This will help us
make a more prudent judgment

214
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,780
and will be of great help

215
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,020
for her followup treatment.

216
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,500
That's all I can do for you.

217
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,500
Xizhou!

218
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,620
I didn't allow you to see her

219
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,900
because she is mentally unstable.

220
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,300
I feared she would hurt you.

221
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,180
Now that you're older,

222
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,180
you can go spend time with her often.

223
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,540
Mom.

224
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:49,980
Hello?

225
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,940
Look into something for me.

226
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,900
(I suggest)

227
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,540
(you try to find out)

228
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,180
(the real reason that triggered
your mother's illness.)

229
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,380
(This will help us
make a more prudent judgment)

230
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,060
(and will be of great help)

231
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,300
(for her followup treatment.)

232
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,380
Hello.

233
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,300
Director Cheng.

234
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,620
Nice to meet you.

235
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,020
Here, have a seat.

236
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,060
These

237
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,460
are all your mother's medical records.

238
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,340
I asked the nurse to compile them.

239
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,500
Thank you.

240
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,060
Are all her medical records in here?

241
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,260
Yes.

242
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,820
Director Cheng.

243
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,900
It does not state

244
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,300
when my mother

245
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,260
stopped talking.

246
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,140
Neither does it state the reason.

247
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,820
Yes.

248
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,020
Your mother wasn't talking
when she was sent here.

249
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,860
Normally, that shouldn't be the case.

250
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,700
I was the doctor in charge here
to take over her case.

251
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,300
That's why I asked

252
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,700
the doctor who sent her here.

253
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,340
I was hoping that he could provide us

254
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,500
with her past medical records.

255
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,540
But

256
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,900
he seemed to be unsure.

257
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,500
He said

258
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,500
there weren't any records.

259
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,020
We only completed the transfer record
based on what he told us

260
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,540
about your mother's condition.

261
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,300
Was he my mother's doctor
from the previous hospital?

262
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,340
About that...

263
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,820
I'm not quite sure.

264
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,900
Do you have his contact information?

265
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,300
We didn't contact him later on,

266
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,420
so I don't have his contact information.

267
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,380
I remember his name was

268
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,900
Lin Yelong.

269
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,500
Lin Yelong?

270
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,140
Yes,

271
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,460
because he signed the transfer form.

272
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:54,860
Thank you.

273
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,180
Contact me if you still need my help.

274
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,310
[Hope]

275
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,500
Xu Li.

276
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,700
Don't worry.

277
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,580
I won't do anything stupid.

278
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,620
I'm not here to comfort you.

279
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,380
This.

280
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,900
Oscar

281
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,100
used to tell the kids fairy tales here.

282
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,260
He wanted them to believe
from an early age

283
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,980
that tomorrow would be a wonderful day.

284
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,500
The same goes for me.

285
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,660
Fu Yunshen!

286
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,620
Fu Yunshen!

287
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,740
I'm right here.

288
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,860
What are you doing there?

289
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,060
Come here.

290
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,460
Come on.

291
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,980
What are you doing? It's dangerous.

292
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,540
Get up here.

293
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,580
No, come down.

294
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,580
- It's too dangerous.
- Get up here.

295
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,580
No, I won't.

296
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,940
Come and have fun.

297
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,940
How is it fun?

298
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,020
Get up here.

299
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,100
I won't. How about you come down?

300
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,380
I can't.

301
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,460
Just come down.

302
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,340
Fine. Here I come.

303
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,500
Watch out!

304
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:30,780
Come on.

305
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,180
Get up here.

306
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,780
Don't be afraid. Come on.

307
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,420
I have laid it out for you.

308
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:04,860
Great.

309
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,180
Come.

310
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,380
I'm afraid of heights.

311
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,780
So am I.

312
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,660
Are you?

313
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,180
Let's go.

314
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,140
Hold on tight. Don't let go.

315
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:25,940
Look.

316
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,980
The view

317
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,620
is very different up here?

318
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,500
Don't you think so?

319
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,060
Let's stop here.

320
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:40,660
You know,

321
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,740
there are many things
that you must be brave to try.

322
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,140
Don't be afraid of it.

323
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,660
Overcome it.

324
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,580
Come on. Sit.

325
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,860
You have to be careful now.

326
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,940
Don't fall off.

327
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,340
Are you scared?

328
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:05,740
Not really.

329
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,100
How do you feel?

330
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,620
I've been wanting

331
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,380
to come up here
since the first day I arrived.

332
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,820
But I got too busy
and didn't get the chance.

333
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,580
What are you trying to tell me?

334
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,420
What I'm trying to say is,

335
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,110
to look at the world
from a different angle.

336
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,300
A lot of things will look different.

337
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,620
I returned the ring to Xu Li today.

338
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,020
She was stronger than I thought.

339
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,740
You are strong too.

340
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,900
You don't have to comfort me.

341
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,020
All these years,

342
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,140
I still couldn't do it.

343
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,180
I couldn't confront death.

344
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,100
I refused to face separation.

345
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,420
That's because

346
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,140
I have one regret.

347
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,060
I didn't get to say goodbye
to my parents.

348
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,020
There is no absolute wrong or right

349
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,900
in every question.

350
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,140
Everyone has different perspectives.

351
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,180
So naturally, we make different choices.

352
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,020
But I am a doctor.

353
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,300
I should always remain level-headed.

354
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,820
Doctors

355
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,220
maintain the strongest rationality

356
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,860
with the deepest love.

357
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,180
Zhu Jiu.

358
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,540
You will

359
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,860
be a remarkable doctor in the future.

360
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,380
You have so much faith in me?

361
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,100
Of course.

362
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,540
Fu Yunshen.

363
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,780
I am really grateful to you.

364
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,140
Thank you for the medicine you brought.

365
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,500
Thank you for the candy you gave me.

366
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,260
Thank you for everything
you have done for this place.

367
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,580
Come on, we're close.

368
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,980
Don't be so formal with me.

369
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,220
Boss, what would you like for dinner?

370
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,020
I'll make it.

371
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Fu Yunshen.

372
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,500
Fu Yunshen.

373
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,340
What's the matter?

374
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,820
Madam Jiang fainted.
She's at the hospital.

375
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,460
How is she?

376
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,340
I don't know.

377
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,380
