00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,220
You sure know how to make the plan
for me.

22
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,540
Come with me, then.

23
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,420
No, thank you.

24
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,540
That's your area of expertise.

is limited.

When you talk to them later,

29
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,220
can you ask

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,060
if large-scale cultivation is possible
in the future?

31
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,340

You did a pretty good job.

Doctor,

41
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,780
please check on the child.

Mr. An, what's this?

44
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,780
Mr. An,

45
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,180
please tell this lady

46
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,380
not to worry.

47
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,860
This can be treated.

48

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
I heard you were shocked today.

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,860
I wasn't shocked.

51
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,020
Don't worry about it.

52
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,220
That skin condition
is actually quite common.

54
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,900
Did you see how it covers his neck?

55
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,860
It does look pretty scary.

56
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,580
But this disease

57
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,620
mainly affects children.

58
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,900
It's rare in adults.

59
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,740
It usually clears up
in five to seven days with medication.

60
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,180
So don't worry

61
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,500
because it won't leave scars

62
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,100
or any adverse effect

63
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,540
on his future life.

64
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,900
Fortunately, you're all here.

65
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,860
Yeah.

66
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,460
Luckily, we're here.

67
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,580
But if those in the more remote areas

68
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,580
don't get proper treatment,

69
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,660
the mortality rate can be quite high.

70
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,300
I can't do anything to help at all.

71
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,720
Yet, here I am, being fascinated

72
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,340

all over the place every day.

74
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,460
To be honest,

75
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,500
I think what you're doing
is very meaningful.

76
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,980
Look, you're taking photos here.

77
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,700
When you return,

78
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,980
you can share these photos
with everyone.

79
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,540
Then, when people see these photos,

80
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,900
they will pay attention to this place

81
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,500
and these children.

82
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,780
You're right.

83
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,100
I came here

84
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,740
mainly to investigate

85
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,460

86
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,700
Well,

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,300
how about this?

88
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,660
Maybe you can take

89
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,100
more candid photos
of life here tomorrow.

90
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,060
That's a good idea.

91
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,580
Sure, I'm good at curating.

92
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,820
Later on,

93
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,620
I can organize a photography exhibition
for the children.

94
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,100
Maybe we can even raise some funds.

95
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,780
You know what?

96
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,460
To me,

97
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,180
even though photographers
can't heal people,

98
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,260
they can inspire many with their photos.

99
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,740
Ruanruan,

100
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,100
I truly think

101
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,460
what you're doing is meaningful.

102
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,540
Thank you for your encouragement.

103
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,700
By the way,

104
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,140
look at the photos I took today.

105
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,540
You really have talent.

106
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,020
Dr. Zhu,

107
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,020
thank you
for coming to comfort me today.

108
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,740
But I still can't like you

109
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,820
because I'm Zhou Zhizhi's best friend.

110
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,060
Professor Hans.

111
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,180
Uncle Hans.

112
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,100
How did it go?

113
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,420
There shouldn't be any problems now.

114
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,860
I'm glad to hear that.

115
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,100
I have good news.

116
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,660
The results from both laboratories
are out.

117
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,820
The Perdo extract is indeed effective
against the virus.

118
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,380
Really? That's fantastic.

119
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,940
We need to conduct further research

120
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,140
and synthesize the antiviral medication
as soon as possible.

121
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,700
But

122
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,220
the amount of the herb you've found
is too little.

123
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,580
It's not enough

124
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,060
for me and Mr. Fu.

125
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,060
Uncle, don't worry.

126
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,300
Yunshen has been with me
during the research.

127
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,220
He's very familiar
with the situation here.

128
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,900
He'll definitely prioritize

129
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,860
the children's lives.

130
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,700
Really?

131
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,860
That's great, then.

132
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,980
I'll go and talk to him.

133
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,580
All right.

134
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,700
- Thank you for your hard work.
- I'll get going now.

135
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,900
You sure packed up fast.

136
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,500
Why did you want to see me here?

137
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,140
Why?

138
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,660
Can't I reach out to you
unless there's a problem?

139
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,380
Sit down.

I have good news to share with you.

142
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,460
Go on.

143
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,420
Uncle Hans said

144
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,700
he sent the blood samples
from the sick children

145
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,060
and the Perdo extract to the laboratory.

146
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,860
They got the results today.

147
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,140
We were right.

148
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,420
These children can be saved.

149
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,100
Zhu Jiu,

150
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,940
you knew my purpose here, right?

151
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,900
Of course, I knew.

152
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,580
That's why I'm here
to ask for your favor.

153
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,420
Can you let the professor
have the medicine?

154
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,380
You also know how unfortunate
these children are.

155
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,260
I can't make

156
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,700
this decision on my own.

157
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,060
My brother has been negotiating
with the Chief

158
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,140
for harvesting rights
these past few days.

159
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,180
Harvesting rights?

160
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,700
Are you saying you want
to monopolize these herbs?

161
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,620
I came here specifically for it.

162
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,940
If you take those herbs,

163
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,020
what will happen to the children?

164
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,140
I can apply

165
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,180
for additional medical funds for them
from the company.

166
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,140
Funds?

167
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,940
Do you think they need money?

168
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,140
They need life-saving medicine!

169
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,940
Zhu Jiu,

170
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
calm down.

171
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,340
Don't confuse things.

172
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,540
In medicine,

173
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,220
finding a research direction
is one thing.

174
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,500
Developing medicine to save lives
is another.

175
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,980
Even if I give up the herbs

176
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,580
to Professor Hans,

177
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
do you know how long it'll take for him

178
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,980
to develop a new medicine?

179
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,820
It could be three or five years.

180
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,940
Or even eight to ten years.

181
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,980
By that time,

182
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,580
- it'll only end...
- What are you trying to say?

183
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,860
These children
will have already died, right?

184
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,340
Don't misinterpret my meaning.

185
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,420
How is every word I say

186
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,940
misinterpreted your words?

187
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:24,980
Zhu Jiu,

188
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,260
I have my tasks and responsibilities.

189
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,980
The entire company and team are waiting.

190
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,780
Besides, I can use Perdo

191
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,700
to save lives as well.

192
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,020
Yes,

193
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,620
I get that you also develop medicine.

194
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,700
But don't you know

195
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,100
that this might be the only chance
for these children?

196
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,540
In medicine,
there's something called "priority".

197
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,060
Fu Yunshen,

198
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,820
can you help them?

199
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,220
I see...

200
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,260
Zhu Jiu.

201
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,340
Can you try to put yourself

202
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,660
in my shoes?

203
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,620
I can.

204
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,940
I can understand
where you're coming from.

205
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,660
But asking me to give up everything?

206
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,020
I really can't do it.

207
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,860
I can't pretend I never came here,

208
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,540
never did the research.

209
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,700
Pretend not to know

210
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,460
these children

211
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,020
might still have a chance to live.

212
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,900
I really can't do it.

213
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,400
[Chapter 1, Overview
of Antihypertensive Medications]

214
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,340
Sit.

215
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,620
What's up?

216
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,620
What is it?

217
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,420
Xizhou,

218
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,220
can we allocate

219
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,460
some of the plants we found

220
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,700
to the professor for research?

221
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,620
He can use them to synthesize medicine

222
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,900
to help the sick children.

223
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,780
You mean the sick children

224
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,580
in the village, right?

225
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,860
You saw them?

226
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,540
I heard about them from Ruanruan.

227
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,980
She went to take photos
of those children during the day.

228
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,340
Those kids...

229
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,100
Grandpa and the board of directors
won't agree.

230
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,860
I'll talk to Grandpa when I get back.

231
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,700
Just give me your support
when the time comes.

232
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,020
Xizhou,

233
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,020
you don't agree?

234
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,140
Yunshen,

235
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,660
I understand your desire to save lives.

236
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,460
Those children are indeed unfortunate.

237
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,820
Not only are they unfortunate,

238
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,460
but they might also not even make it
to adulthood.

239
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,900
Yunshen,

240
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,700
you also know

241
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,660
the company's current situation
isn't great.

242
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,140
When you first proposed this project,

243
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,940
Grandpa and I
wholeheartedly supported you.

244
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,540
To provide you with sufficient funding,

245
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,860
I didn't hesitate to cut the budget
for my department.

246
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,340
Now, you're saying
you're not going to do it?

247
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,060
You,

248
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:39,980
me,

249
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,100
Grandpa,

250
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,260
and even your mom

251
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,580
will all be held accountable
by the board of directors.

252
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,580
I know.

253
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,020
That's why I suggested allocating some

254
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,020
to Professor Hans.

255
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,660
I'll also work hard
on developing my new project.

256
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,860
You make it sound easy.

257
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,220
Starting a new project

258
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,420
isn't that simple.

259
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,980
And the current project

260
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,260
has significant commercial value.

261
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,100
The company also needs some good news.

262
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,260
Xizhou,

263
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,660
you know

264
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,740
I'm in pharmaceutical research
and development

265
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,060
is to save lives.

266
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:29,980
Yunshen,

267
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,980
let me ask you this.

268
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,060
How many children in that village
are sick

269
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,220
in total?

270
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,060
Five?

271
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,460
Ten?

272
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,100
Or twenty?

273
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,460
Do you know
how many employees Lingtian has?

274
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,660
Over five thousand.

275
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,460
Xizhou,

276
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,820
giving up some herbs

277
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,380
might slow down our progress.

278
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,500
But it could give those kids

279
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,540
a chance to survive.

280
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,540
This project
is currently the company's hope.

281
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,580
Yunshen,

282
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,300
if the financial reports
for the next quarter

283
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,820
still don't look good,

284
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,700
the company will have to
undergo massive layoffs.

285
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,820
The first to be let go

286
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,100
will be the older employees.

287
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,740
They have families to support.

288
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,780
You're right.

289
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,980
Illness is painful.

290
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,020
But unemployment can push
many families into despair.

291
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,700
Xizhou,

292
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,780
I get it now.

293
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,300
I'll think it over.

294
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,220
Xizhou,

295
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,580
can you put off
the harvesting rights issue for now?

296
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,660
I need more time to consider.

297
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,100
All right.

298
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,300
By the way,

299
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,580
the helicopter is arriving tomorrow.

300
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,220
We'll leave together then.

301
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,140
About tomorrow,

302
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,620
I won't go back for the time being.

303
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,260
I'll stay and talk to Professor Hans

304
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,740
to see if there are other options.

305
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,220
All right, then.

306
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,980
Take care of yourself.

307
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,180
Get some rest.

308
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,980
Don't wander around in this place.

309
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,380
If you need anything,
remember to find Yunshen.

310
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,220
Although I'm reluctant to see you go,

311
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,260
I'm a bit happy to see

312
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,340
how worried you are about me.

313
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,140
I'll get going, then.

314
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,420
When you arrive, remember to call me
on the satellite phone.

315
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,500
You must call.

316
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,180
I'll miss you.

317
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,020
You must miss me too.

318
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,780
Three times a day.

319
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,500
Don't forget.

320
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,940
Come back
after you're done taking photos.

321
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,340
I know.

322
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,220
See you.

323
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,500
Xizhou,

324
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,860
safe journey!

325
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,700
Dr. Zhu, Boss.

326
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,020
This local freshly baked bread

327
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,540
is delicious.

328
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,340
Here, try some. Try some.

329
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,300
Let me break off a piece for you.

330
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,340
Hey, guys.

331
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,740
We need to leave here right away.

332
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,740
Did anything happen?

333
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,540
Na Lu is unconscious.

334
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,580
Several children have high fevers
that won't go down.

335
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,300
I suspect it's a viral infection.

336
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,540
What's the situation?

337
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,500
I'm not sure yet.

338
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,060
The medical conditions here are limited.

339
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,020
I want to take these patients

340
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,580
to Naotao Medical Station
as soon as possible.

341
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,180
But those children are so young.

342
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,980
Can they handle such a long journey?

343
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,740
She's right.

344
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,700
Professor,

345
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,580
let's go by water.

346
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,380
We'll ask Sen to find a boat now.

347
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,100
All right. The faster, the better.

348
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,060
All right.

349
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,500
- Come on.
- Okay, let's go.

350
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,300
All right, here we are.

351
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,700
Be careful, everyone.

352
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,540
One at a time.

353
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,500
Madam, be careful.

354
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,780
Watch your step.

355
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,500
Be careful.

356
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,500
One at a time.

357
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,620
Give me the luggage.

358
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,380
Professor Hans.

359
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,660
Professor.

360
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,660
How is it?

361
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,460
The test results are in.

362
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,740
They're infected

363
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,020
with a virus called V-Four.

364
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,620
Dr. Zhu.

365
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,260
Le,

366
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,540
why are you so early?

367
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,300
I went to bed early, so here I am.

368
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,300
My boss couldn't finish his breakfast

369
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,300
and left some for you.

370
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,460
Don't waste it.

371
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,500
It's a shame to waste food.

372
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,460
That's right.

373
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,140
Boss spent all night on...

374
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,180
Okay.

375
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,420
I'll take them.

376
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,700
Thank your Boss

377
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,540
for his well-balanced

378
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,620
leftover breakfast.

379
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,100
Boss,

380
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,740
Dr. Zhu says thank you.

381
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,460
I think Dr. Zhu
isn't mad at you anymore.

382
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,260
Look, she even finished the breakfast.

383
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,780
No wonder they say
it's good to date a science guy.

384
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,300
Boss, you're amazing.

385
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,660
Enough talking. Let's go.

386
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,540
Wait,

387
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,060
where are we going?

388
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,140
We're helping the villagers
with indoor disinfection.
where are we going?

389
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,780
We're helping the villagers
with indoor disinfection.

390
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,260
After that, we'll go up the mountain

391
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,540
and see
if there are any usable medicinal herbs.

392
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,580
We've only slept
for a little over two hours.

393
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,260
Aren't we going back
to sleep a bit more?

394
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,140
Didn't everyone only sleep
for about two hours?

395
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,780
Are you talking about Dr. Zhu?

396
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,380
I'm not sleepy. Are you sleepy?

397
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:47,780
Yes.

398
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,300
No, I'm not.

399
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,260
So, am I sleepy or not?

400
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,300
No, you're not.

401
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,100
Wait.

402
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,260
I'm not sleepy.

403
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,700
But I'm just worried about you.

404
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,940
Lack of sleep
can weaken your immune system.

405
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,460
And then we might get infected
by the virus.

406
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,100
No, you won't.

407
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,780
You've been vaccinated
against every disease in the world.

408
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,980
Boss,

409
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,660
I can stay awake.

410
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,340
Can you make me a sandwich

411
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,940
to replenish my energy?

412
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,220
Sure, I'll make one for you.

413
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,500
Yes!

414
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,140
(The V-Four virus spreads
through respiratory droplets.)

415
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,020
(People with weakened immune systems
are more susceptible.)

416
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,620
(After infection,)

417
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,420
(the main symptoms
include respiratory issues,)

418
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,180
(persistent high fever,)

419
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,300
(coughing,)

420
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,220
(shortness of breath,)

421
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,580
(and difficulty breathing.)

422
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,180
(Severe infections
can lead to pneumonia,)

423
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,980
(acute respiratory distress syndrome,)

424
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,180
(and liver and kidney failure.)

425
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,860
(If not treated promptly,)

426
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,420
(it can lead to death.)

427
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,060
(So, those who have close contact
with the patients)

428
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,500
(must be quarantined.)

429
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,340
(Our medical station has limited beds.)

430
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,900
(So we've set up
a temporary quarantine area.)

431
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,180
(in the school classrooms.)

432
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,020
(All students and parents
who have been in contact with Oscar)

433
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,020
(will be quarantined here together.)

434
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,500
(What we can do now)

435
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,060
is to prevent the epidemic
from spreading further

436
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,340
while waiting for the antiviral serum
to arrive.

437
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,740
Guys,

438
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,500
I'm counting on you.

439
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,660
Danmin.

440
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,850
[Hope]

441
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,200
[Quarantine. No Entry]

442
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,460
Miss,

443
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,660
how's Danmin?

444
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,060
Did I infect him?

445
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,860
Don't worry.

446
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,980
He's fine.

447
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,580
You have to get better soon.

448
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,060
So you can see him, okay?

449
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,340
Okay.

450
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,980
Have a good rest.

451
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,340
Thank you.

452
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,540
Uncle Hans,

453
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,780
how's Danmin doing?

454
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,380
Oscar is worried about him.

455
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,220
Here is his test report for today.

456
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,660
Danmin has shown

457
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,980
some symptoms of V-Four.

458
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,260
His white blood cell count is too low.

459
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,220
At the time, Danmin cried
and wanted to go back to school.

460
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,540
He said he missed his classmates
and teacher.

461
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,300
I let them talk on the phone.

462
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,860
But Danmin didn't cooperate.

463
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,140
Oscar couldn't bear it.

464
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,500
So he came to the hospital to see him.

465
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,180
Even if it's not this virus,

466
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,420
any bacteria in the air

467
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,620
could take his life.

468
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,500
But

469
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,700
Danmin's mother and Anson understand

470
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,020
and don't blame Oscar.

471
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,980
After all, he's also seriously ill.

472
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,900
Aunt Addy,

473
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,140
why haven't we seen

474
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,460
Oscar's family here?

475
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,180
His wife recently went
to another village to teach.

476
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,140
We've already informed her.

477
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,820
Okay.

478
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,220
Hello?

479
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,100
Hello, Dr. Ji.

480
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,620
How's the situation on your end?

481
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,020
We've mostly identified those

482
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,500
who have had contact with the patients.

483
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,380
It's better than I expected.

484
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,220
That's good.

485
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,460
Hopefully,

486
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,140
it would stop spreading.

487
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,220
Mint,

488
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,580
are you okay?

489
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,580
I'm fine.

490
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,740
It's just that the aid station
is a bit short-handed.

491
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,220
So it's quite busy.

492
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,820
Even if it's busy, you need to rest.

493
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,100
Only by maintaining good health
can you work well,

494
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,780
understand?

495
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,420
Don't worry about me.

496
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,020
Take care of yourself too.

497
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,060
I'll leave the tribal area to you.

498
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:41,780
Okay.

499
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,220
Stay in touch.

500
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,700
Thank you.

501
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,340
You're welcome.

502
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,380
Let's cooperate happily.

503
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,740
What's wrong?

504
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,580
The minister is asking about the progress
of the supply and medicine distribution.

505
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,180
There's nothing that I can do
if the road is closed.

506
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,860
There are nosy foreign journalists

507
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,650
who want to go to
Naotao and Ninggu Village

508
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,060
to report the epidemic.

509
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,780
I have already released
the medicine and supplies.

510
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,140
Aren't we waiting for the good weather
to fly?

511
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,660
Tell the minister not to worry.

512
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,820
They can't get into Naotao and Ninggu
without an airplane.

513
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,860
We won't let them report it.

514
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,420
What happened in Naotao?

515
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,900
Nothing.

516
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,340
Just a wild outbreak.

517
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,660
That can be treated.

518
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,660
We just have to send medicine.

519
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,460
How long has it been?

520
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,140
A couple of days.

521
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:53,860
Sir,

522
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,300
I need your help.

523
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,220
Morning.

524
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,100
What are you doing here?

525
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,140
This medicine looks very familiar.

526
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,500
There are many antiviral herbs here.

527
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,460
What you're making looks
just like the traditional herbal pouch

528
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,180
my grandmother used to make for me
when I was a child.

529
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,060
Are you trying to use it
to treat V-Four?

530
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,540
Just taking a shot.

531
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,300
The roads are blocked,

532
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,820
and even the helicopter can't get in.

533
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,340
Waiting isn't an option.

534
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,540
What are you looking at?

535
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:04,940
Handsome, right?

536
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,740
I usually look pretty handsome
when I'm working.

537
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,220
Imagine me

538
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,180
holding precision instruments.

539
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,140
It's not something
ordinary people get to see.

540
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,700
Yes, it's especially handsome.

541
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,660
Your weather forecast
may not be accurate.

542
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,740
But the herbal pouch
will definitely be useful.

543
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,260
Dr. Zhu,

544
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,220
Luca has a fever.

545
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,380
Come and take a look quickly.

546
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,500
Follow me to the examination room.

547
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,860
Fu Yunshen.

548
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Xizhou said
you weren't answering the phone.

549
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,020
You should call him back.

550
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,740
Ruanruan, where's your camera?

551
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,340
I'm not taking photos for now.

552
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,820
They need extra hands here.

553
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,500
Yes, Xizhou?

554
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,740
There's an outbreak on your side.

555
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,340
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

556
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,700
I want you
to bring Ruanruan back with you now.

557
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,620
You'll come back to Shanghai with me.

558
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,420
It has been raining here

559
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,420
and the roads are blocked.

560
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,500
We can't get out.

561
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,540
The weather is already improving.

562
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,740
The government has sent a helicopter,

563
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,260
medical teams, and serum.

564
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,140
Both of you will fly back to the capital
on the helicopter.

565
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,500
I can't, Xizhou.

566
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,460
I need to work with the medical team

567
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,620
and do some handover.

568
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,020
Hand over what?

569
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,380
You're not a doctor.

570
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,060
Do you want me to go
with the medical team

571
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,220
and drag you back here?

572
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,460
Xizhou,

573
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,620
don't exaggerate

574
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,780
just because you heard
about the outbreak.

575
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,700
We've already kept it under control.

576
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,260
The infected villagers
have all been isolated.

577
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,060
So I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

578
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,460
With the serum,
there won't be any more problems.

579
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,180
So don't worry anymore.

580
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,060
Yunshen, can you listen to me once?

581
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,820
Just for once!

582
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,540
Hello?

583
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,700
Xizhou, the signal is bad.

584
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,140
By the way,

585
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,180
I entrust you
Grandpa and Madam Jiang's matters.

586
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,300
Keep this a secret and you know why.

587
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,420
Hello?

588
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,820
Fu Yunshen lied to you.

589
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,940
The signal is good here.

590
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,220
Ruanruan,

591
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,580
the medical team here

592
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,300
might go over at any time.

593
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,020
If Yunshen doesn't come back,

594
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,020
you should come back first.

595
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,100
I'm staying too.

596
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,860
Why are you causing trouble too?

597
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,660
Gosh, I'm not.

598
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,820
Before coming here,
Zhizhi prepared various medicines for me.

599
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,780
So don't worry.

600
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,820
I haven't married you yet.

601
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,540
How can I die just like that?

602
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,900
Are you really worried about me
right now?

603
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,540
Then you better keep worrying about me.

604
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,340
I want to enjoy

605
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,100
this special treatment longer.

606
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,740
Hello?

607
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,500
Hello?

608
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,300
I guess the signal is really bad here.

609
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,740
What are you doing?

610
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,060
You've never seen the cutest person
in the universe?

611
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,780
If Fu Xizhou dares not to marry you,

612
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,900
I'll sever ties with him.

613
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,380
Righteous man.

614
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:51,980
Just being wise.

615
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,140
I'll get going.

616
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,500
Bye-bye.

617
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,580
Be safe.

618
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,620
Dr. Zhu,

619
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,340
where's Professor Hans?

620
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,180
He's busy inside.

621
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,100
Are you looking for him?

622
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,180
- This is...
- Dr. Zhu,

623
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,740
I'm Oscar's wife.

624
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,140
Is my husband okay now?

625
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,300
I'd like to see him.

626
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,420
He has an infectious disease.

627
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,820
You can't see him now.

628
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,340
I'll be careful.

629
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,980
I will wear protective gear.

630
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,780
Can I just take a quick look?

631
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,660
Please!

632
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,460
Mint,

633
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,180
Oscar is experiencing
a hyperactive immune response.

634
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,060
The conditions here

635
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,740
make it difficult
to provide further treatment.

636
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,740
What do you mean?

637
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,340
What happened to my husband?

638
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,060
This won't do.

639
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,820
I have to see him.

640
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,780
I must see him now!

641
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,860
If you go and see him,

642
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,900
you could easily get infected.

643
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,940
It's too dangerous.

644
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,180
Please.

645
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,300
I'm not afraid to die.

646
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,780
I can sign an agreement.

647
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,580
My decision has nothing to do with you.

648
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,500
Please take her away.

649
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,500
This is the quarantine area.

650
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,580
It's too dangerous.

651
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,700
Get her out of here quickly.

652
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,580
Ms. Xu, come.

653
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,220
Please take care of her.

654
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,420
What happened to my husband?

655
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:04,980
Ms. Xu,

656
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,180
go home first.

657
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,860
The doctors said
they would take good care of them.

658
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,220
When can I see him?

659
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,500
I believe it will be soon.

660
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,380
Uncle Hans!

661
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,900
Uncle Hans.

662
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,300
If...

663
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,660
I mean

664
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,460
if there is any possibility
that I could help her take precautions

665
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,580
so they can meet for a moment?

666
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,020
We don't have any antiviral serum
right now.

667
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,820
We can't let her take that risk.

668
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,820
I understand.

669
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,380
But if we watch her

670
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,340
and don't let them
have any close contact,

671
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,500
just let them meet once.

672
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,820
Or perhaps say a few words,

673
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,580
- Oscar's condition might...
- Mint.

674
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,500
You're a doctor.

675
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,700
You must be responsible for every life.

676
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,780
You can't let your emotions
get the best of you.

677
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,460
Yes, I know.

678
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,820
Have you ever thought about it?

679
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,460
If Oscar were to die like this,

680
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,580
they might not even have a chance
to say goodbye.

681
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,740
Mint,

682
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,460
I'm disappointed in you.

683
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,900
- I must see him today!
- You can't go inside!

684
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,140
If I don't see him now,
it will be too late.

685
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,700
This is the quarantine area.

686
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,140
- You can't!
- I must see him!

687
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:29,980
Xu Li!

688
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,500
Calm down!

689
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,420
Didn't we agree beforehand?

690
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,380
If you don't let me see him now,

691
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,380
can you guarantee he'll be able

692
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,980
to stand in front of me
without harm after this?

693
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,340
We'll take good care of him.

694
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,500
I can't leave like this, Dr. Zhu.

695
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,060
I have to go inside now.

696
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,780
I have something to say to him.

697
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,180
We had an argument

698
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,660
before we left previously.

699
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,780
I said a lot of things I shouldn't have

700
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,900
and hurtful things.

701
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,100
He must be feeling terrible

702
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,700
all alone in there right now.

703
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,140
I have to go in and be with him

704
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,180
to tell him

705
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
that I miss him

706
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,980
and I love him.

707
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,100
We've been together
from university until now,

708
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,540
for most of our lives.

709
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,460
I can't let
the last thing he heard from me

710
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,380
was I hate him.

711
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,540
Hello?

712
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,140
Hi, Dr. Hans.

713
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,340
Tomorrow morning,

714
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,860
the medical team
will fly the serum over.

715
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,580
That's great.

716
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,740
That is good news.

717
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,140
So you guys hang on

718
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,100
and wait for us, okay?

719
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:56,940
Okay.

720
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,180
Thank you. Thank you.

721
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,220
[Hope]

722
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,580
Honey,

723
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,220
are you okay?

724
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,860
I'm okay.

725
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,460
I'm sorry

726
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,740
to have left you alone.

727
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,060
How did you get in?

728
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,220
Aren't you afraid I will infect you?

729
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,740
That would be great.

730
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,420
Then I can lay next to you.

731
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,180
This is great.

732
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,500
I was just wishing

733
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,020
that I hope I can see you
when I open my eyes.

734
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,020
If I can see you one last time,

735
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,620
I can die happily.

736
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,260
No, you can't, Oscar.

737
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,060
I can't live without you.

738
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,620
Don't say that.

739
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,460
You will be sad in the beginning.

740
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,900
Don't stay here alone.

741
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,460
You have to go back home

742
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,020
and let your family and friends
to keep you company.

743
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,020
Eat good food,

744
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,580
