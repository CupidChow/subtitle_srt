00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,700
He had a car accident.

376
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,660
His leg nerves are damaged,

377
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,740
and he can't walk.

378
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,900
Shouldn't he go

379
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,780
to the neurology center in our hospital?

380
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,340
His family knows

381
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,460
that the neurology center here
is highly reputable.

382
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,140
That was why they sent him over.

383
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,900
But he refuses to receive treatment.

384
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,220
Why?

385
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,780
Because the new therapy

386
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,100
is during an experimental phase

387
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,980
and contains many uncertain factors.

388
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,340
He thinks it's not reliable.

389
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,540
He has already
tried many methods in China

390
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,140
but to no avail.

391
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,980
So, he started to give up on himself.

392
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,420
Therefore,

393
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,900
he's using TCM for conservative treatment,

394
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,540
taking pain relief injections,

395
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,380
and doing regular check-ups.

396
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,020
I'm looking for a doctor who has TCM knowledge

397
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,260
and can prepare herbal medicines.

398
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,580
There's no one more suitable than you.

399
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,140
Well.

400
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,300
I have a day off tomorrow.

401
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,620
I'll go check on him.

402
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,380
But don't get ahead of yourself.

403
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,220
I may be the seventh poor doctor.

404
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,180
You're a godsend.

405
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,260
Thank you so much.

406
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,660
Hi, Mint.

407
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,220
Pull over here.

408
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

409
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,900
I'm the new family doctor.

410
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,580
Leo told me about you.

411
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,100
I'm Luo Lin.

412
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,140
I'm the housekeeper here.

413
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:07,940
You can call me Linda.

414
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,700
Nice to meet you.

415
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,260
Let's go.

416
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,380
- Let me carry this for you.
- Thank you.

417
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,980
Mint. This way, please.

418
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,980
This place is spacious.

419
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,900
You need to get familiar with it.

420
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,700
Or else you might get lost at night.

421
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,260
I will.

422
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,500
Why is it so dark in here?

423
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,860
Why aren't the curtains drawn open?

424
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,940
Good morning, Linda.

425
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:52,940
Morning.

426
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,100
This is the drawing room.

427
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,540
You may look around here.

428
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,220
By the way,

429
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,020
did Leo brief you

430
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,100
about your job scope?

431
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,780
Yes, he did.

432
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,140
Oh, right.

433
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,660
You haven't answered

434
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
why you turn on all the lights here

435
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,100
instead of opening the curtains.

436
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,820
Because Sir doesn't like lights.

437
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,940
Please don't open the curtains
in his room

438
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,580
or turn on the main lights in the house.

439
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,500
If you really need the light,

440
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,660
you can use the table lamp.

441
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:55,900
And

442
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,540
Sir doesn't like noise.

443
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,780
Please walk and talk

444
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,260
softly.

445
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,620
Try not to make any noise

446
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,340
when you're moving.

447
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,580
Do you want to go upstairs

448
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,380
and greet him first?

449
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:14,940
Sure.

450
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,260
Are you afraid of dogs?

451
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,260
Big one.

452
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,700
No.

453
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,100
What about an eccentric one?

454
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,420
Are you talking about a person or a dog?

455
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,060
Both of them share a similar character.

456
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,220
I'm a doctor.

457
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,100
Don't worry about that.

458
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,060
That's great.

459
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,300
I'll take you upstairs, then.

460
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,460
This is the parlor.

461
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,660
That's the kitchen.

462
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,860
You can prepare
the herbal decocting over there.

463
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,460
Your room is over there.

464
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,580
The biggest room upstairs belongs to Sir.

465
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,020
By the way, Mint.

466
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,740
I need to go out to attend something.

467
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,860
I've already told Sir about you.

468
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,740
You may go upstairs yourself.

469
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:05,860
Okay.

470
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,220
Hello, is anybody here?

471
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,300
Hello.

472
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,420
I'm coming in.

473
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,660
Hello.

474
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,660
I'm coming in.

475
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,380
I'm the new family doctor.

476
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:53,780
Sorry.

477
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,180
I did knock just now.

478
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,220
Get out.

479
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,460
You...

480
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,100
What has happened to you?

481
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,340
Get out.

482
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,420
Yunshen.

483
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,940
What had happened?

484
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,860
Your leg...

485
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,060
Your leg.

486
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,020
Get out.

487
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,900
Get out!

488
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,980
I said, get out!

489
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,380
Leave!

490
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:33,900
I'll leave.

491
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,780
Now!

492
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,460
Urine output is low.

493
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,620
You need to drink more water.

494
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,940
Have you started passing stool?

495
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,460
Not yet.

496
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,540
Hello.

497
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,500
They are
the professional physiotherapists.

498
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,460
The surgery went on successfully.

499
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,500
The following treatment is focused
on his rehabilitation therapy.

500
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,140
Gu, you may start.

501
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,180
But my son hasn't talked yet.

502
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,460
Please be patient.

503
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,940
He underwent a big operation.

504
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,340
He needs time.

505
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,380
Besides, having a positive mindset
is important too.

506
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,100
So,

507
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,820
you should communicate with him more.

508
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,860
Interact with him

509
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,700
and encourage him.

510
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,100
Thus, he will heal up quickly.

511
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,420
Madam,

512
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,540
we're relaxing his muscles

513
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,460
to prevent muscular dystrophy.

514
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,340
Be careful.

515
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,390
We're going to do
passive exercises for him

516
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,350
to avoid joint adhesion.

517
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,510
It requires some intense movements.

518
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,590
Madam.

519
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,830
He's at the early stage of rehabilitation.

520
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,230
We just gave him

521
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,510
the proper limb position practice

522
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,590
and joint exercises.

523
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,590
You should pay attention

524
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,870
to regularly positioning his limbs.

525
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,190
Turn his body every hour.

526
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,270
Every hour, right?

527
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:15,750
Yes.

528
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,550
Take note of this, Chen Le.

529
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,030
Okay.

530
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,990
If you have any questions,

531
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,990
you can consult with Dr. Gu

532
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,830
or me.

533
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,470
Anyone of us will do.

534
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,350
Okay. Thank you.

535
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,190
Appreciate your effort.

536
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,990
Okay. That's it for today.

537
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,150
See you.

538
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:26,950
Okay. See you.

539
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,310
(He lost all mobility below the waist)

540
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,950
(due to the lumbar spinal cord injuries.)

541
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,190
(Whether or not he could stand up again)

542
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,990
(depends on his rehabilitation progress.)

543
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,430
Is there any discomfort?

544
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,310
I'll help you turn your body.

545
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,390
No need.

546
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:44,630
Your urine output has been slightly low.

547
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,070
Remember to drink more water.

548
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,950
Have you passed stool today?

549
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,870
Any difficulties?

550
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,350
Maintain a positive mood.

551
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,390
It'll speed up your recovery.
