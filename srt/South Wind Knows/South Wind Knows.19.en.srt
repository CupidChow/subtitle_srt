Really?

25
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,340
Should I nominate you
for the Nobel Prize?

26
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,540
Major discovery!

27
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,780
I found out

28
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,660
that the Perdo's derivatives

29
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,580
can activate the immune system

30
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,820
and recruit immune cells in the body

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,300
to eliminate tumors.

Perdo's extract

38
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,060
can combat Danmin Disease,

39
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,300
and its derivative can combat tumors?

40
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,340
That's right!

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,580
Speaking of which,

42
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,900
I should thank you

43
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,060
for helping me

44
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,780
to identify
the wrong chemical structure.

45
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,100

46
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,700
Is that proven already?

47

I believe

50
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,100

I had a business to attend to.

76

You could've postponed it.

you've been upset

and had a hard time accepting the truth.

82
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,580

83
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,420
No.

What a coincidence.

00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,660
You come just in time.

132
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,260
Look.

133
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,780
Dr. Zhu's boyfriend bought us coffee.

134
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,580
Here, taste this.

135
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,340
That's right.

136
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,340
I have something else to attend to.

137
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,180
I need to go now.

138
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,980
I'm not drinking that.

139
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,220
But this is from your favorite shop.

140
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,420
Is she in a bad mood?

141
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,660
She's been working
for the past 18 hours.

142
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,780
She must be tired.

143
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,020
Go and get changed.

144
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,340
Okay.

This is a lovely place

and sunlight.

150
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,180
It's helpful for patients.

151

152

"He said,"

173
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,140
"I didn't eat the food
because they yelled at me rudely."

174
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,220

Look at your happy face.

183
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,220
You smile like the Cheshire cat.

184
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,540
I'm not.

185
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,940
Are you seeing someone?

186
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,460
Very good.

187
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,620
Where is this man from?

188
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,540
A foreigner or a Chinese?

189
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,740
What does he do for a living?

190
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,860
Does he treat you well?

191
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,020
Granny.

192
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,300
You have so many questions.

193
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,500
I don't know how to answer them.

194
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,900
But I'm curious.

195
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,380
I'll tell you.

196
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,420
His name is Fu Yunshen.

197
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,180
We met in Country M.

198
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,340
He's from Shanghai.

199
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,300
Shanghai?

200
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,740
That's great!

201
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,340
He is
in the pharmaceutical research area.

202
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,100
He treats me very well.

203
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,300
I see, that's good.

204
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,940
When are you taking him home?

205
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,620
I must ask him
to prepare well before that.

206
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,620
There's no need to prepare anything.

207
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,580
Have you eaten yet?

208
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,220
No, I'm hungry.

209
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,900
Let's go down. The dinner is ready.

210
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,860
Come on.

211
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,820
Granny.

212
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,460
Hello, what time is it now?

213
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,940
Yeah, it's two.

214
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,620
I'm so devoted to my work, right?

215
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,900
What's the matter?

216
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,060
The material is all ready.

217
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,060
I've sent it to your email.

218
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,260
Listen,

219
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,660
it took me a really long time

220
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,620
to come up with this.

221
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,540
Good job.

222
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,270
[Boss]

223
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,620
Hello, Boss.

224
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,700
Why are you calling
in the early morning?

225
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,860
The research on Perdo

226
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,900
has breakthroughs and discoveries.

227
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,100
Leo has already sent us the information.

228
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,100
Really?

229
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:09,940
That...

230
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,300
That's great.

231
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,940
Announce a meeting at 10 AM.

232
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,660
Okay.

233
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,900
Goodness!

234
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,420
How terrible!

235
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,940
Keep it down.

236
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,500
Fu Yunshen is indeed a trouble.

237
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,020
How could you blame him for this?

238
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,220
Stop defending him.

239
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,140
Why are you still helping him
when you're so upset?

240
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,500
Well, stop here.

241
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,180
You told me

242
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,020
you have something important to tell me.

243
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,900
What's it?

244
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,260
Something important about your life.

245
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,420
Don't give me that look.

246
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,060
For your marriage life,

247
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,900
I've thoroughly searched for single men

248
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,060
and assessed them

249
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,300
via strict,

250
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,940
meticulous,

251
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,380
and cruel elimination procedure...

252
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,220
Ruanruan.

253
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,300
Go straight to the point.

254
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,220
The point is,

255
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,820
finally, I've picked this man

256
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,940
with a careful selection

257
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,740
to have a chance
to go on a blind date with you.

258
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,500
He's my cousin.

259
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,020
He went to study overseas
since high school.

260
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,140
He was majoring in finance,

261
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,460
and he is now working at a bank.

262
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,500
He's 1.85m tall,

263
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,260
handsome, and has a likable personality.

264
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,020
Take a look.

265
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,580
If you have a good impression of him,

266
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,100
I'll set up a date with you.

267
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,380
He saw your photo at my place before

268
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,140
and kept saying that you're pretty.

269
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,340
If you think he's not suitable,

270
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,820
- I'll...
- Sure.

271
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,980
I've already prepared

272
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,060
a ton of lines to convince you, though.

273
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,100
Yet you agreed so quickly.

274
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,820
It's said

275
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,820
that the best way to forget someone

276
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,220
is to start a new relationship, right?

277
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,180
That's all for today's meeting.

278
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,100
Meeting adjourned.

279
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,220
Chen Le.

280
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,220
Compile all the information

281
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,660
and come up with a vaccine proposal
for lymphoma.

282
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,200
We're going to work
on the lymphoma project,

283
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,540
not the Danmin Disease one?

284
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,220
We do both.

285
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,140
But we...

286
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,940
Don't be so dense.

287
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,980
The board has been stopping us

288
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,060
from working
on the Danmin Disease project,

289
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,460
saying that it's a waste of money.

290
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,180
But the lymphoma vaccine

291
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,940
has a promising commercial prospect.

292
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,660
As long as we obtain
the commercial rights for Perdo,

293
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,260
we can do anything we want.

294
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,260
You'll take charge of the proposal.

295
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,140
Do it nicely.

296
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,340
Make both of the projects impressive,

297
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,180
especially emphasizing

298
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,500
their commercial prospect.

299
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,420
Boss.

300
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,580
Don't worry, I'll see to that.

301
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,540
Give me a call if you have any problems.

302
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,260
Okay.

303
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,700
[Baopu Art Museum]

304
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,600
[The World Can Be Better]

305
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,950
[Gu Ruanruan]

306
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,700
Sorry.

307
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,500
Please excuse me.

308
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,580
Fu Yunshen.

309
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,900
It's you.

310
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,740
It's been a while, Ruanruan.

311
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,260
You're the fine one to talk.

312
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,660
I've given you so many texts

313
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,820
and calls.

314
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,300
But you never replied to me.
That's mean.

315
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,540
That's why I come to make amends.

316
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,300
Have your legs fully recovered?

317
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,540
How are you?

318
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,500
"You"?

319
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Show me some respect, okay?

320
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,780
I'm your sister-in-law.

321
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,020
Come on, greet me.

322
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,820
Ruanruan.

323
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,620
Have you been faring well?

324
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,460
Yes, pretty well.

325
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,100
Look.

326
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,340
Just after I finished
the photography exhibition,

327
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,700
a publishing house

328
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,300
published my works.

329
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,060
It's a keepsake for me.

330
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,660
Well done.

331
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,100
You've become an author.

332
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,980
Cut that out.

333
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,260
You turn up here all of a sudden.

334
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,660
Did anything happen?

335
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,980
Nothing.

336
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,140
I'm here to visit you.

337
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,300
Don't beat around the bush.

338
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,660
Look how you hesitate.

339
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,740
I realized Xizhou has changed a lot

340
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,940
after coming back this time.

341
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,860
Did I do something wrong?

342
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,380
Did he mention anything to you?

343
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,300
No, he didn't.

344
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,300
But I can feel
that you're aware of something

345
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,460
but refuse to tell.

346
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,380
Gu Ruanruan.

347
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,220
You're not good at lying.

348
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,300
Is it something that you can't tell me?

349
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,380
He doesn't change at all.

350
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,260
If you think something wrong is going on

351
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,500
between you and him,

352
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,420
you should talk to him face-to-face.

353
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,100
Right?

354
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,860
I have guests over there.

355
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,900
I need to go now.

356
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,140
Let's have a meal one of these days.

357
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:29,860
Bye-bye.

358
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,720
Let's go home.

359
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,620
All right.

360
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
You can leave me here.

361
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,540
It's been tough for you these two days.

362
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,740
I'll walk you home

363
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,260
and pay Granny a visit.

364
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:56,780
No.

365
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,660
"No"?

366
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,340
You rejected me so quickly.

367
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,740
My heart hurts, you know?

368
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,140
It's not that.

369
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,020
You haven't had enough rest these days.

370
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,900
I'll introduce you to Granny properly

371
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,940
when we have rest days next time.

372
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,780
All right.

373
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,300
You're so considerate, Dr. Zhu.

374
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,460
I'll let you slide this time.

375
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,420
Get rest early.

376
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:16,980
Good night.

377
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,220
I think I came at the wrong time.

378
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,180
Maybe... I should go inside.

379
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,460
Hello, Granny.

380
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,460
I'm Zhu Jiu's boyfriend.
My name is Fu Yunshen.

381
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,940
Very well.

382
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,300
Since you're here,

383
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,220
come on in.

384
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,100
Sure.

385
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,500
There.

386
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,820
Each of you

387
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,940
takes one bamboo tray.

388
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,740
Okay.

389
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,460
Leave it to me.

390
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,380
Granny.

391
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,100
This is good.

392
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,980
It's nighttime now,

393
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,620
so I won't brew tea.

394
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,820
I made these dried honeysuckles myself.

395
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,780
It's mellow.

396
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,940
It helps to remove feverish heat.

397
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,060
I wonder if you're used to the taste.

398
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,060
Yes, I am.

399
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,340
I always have this at home.

400
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,020
Really?

401
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,260
How does it taste?

402
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
Really good.

403
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:27,900
Granny.

404
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,140
I'm very interested in plants
and herbs too.

405
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,300
Zhu Jiu told me

406
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,260
you do some research on these too.

407
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,100
If so,

408
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,540
we can exchange knowledge.

409
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,580
I don't know much about them,

410
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,860
but I quite like them.

411
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,140
Well, I'll come here more often
in the future.

412
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,420
Please don't get annoyed with me.

413
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,980
I won't.

414
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
All right, Granny.

415
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,260
I'm hungry.

416
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,420
What do we have for dinner?

417
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,260
I'm so happy
that I forgot to prepare dinner.

418
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,420
Granny, let me help you.

419
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,620
Right away.

420
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,580
No need.

421
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,020
It won't take long.

422
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,780
No, I must help you.

423
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,380
- I want to learn from you
- Well, come with me.

424
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,140
to cook for Zhu Jiu later.

425
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
Please enjoy your meal.

426
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

427
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,300
I heard from Ruanruan

428
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,940
that you've known each other
for a long time.

429
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,100
Yes.

430
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,980
You must be tight with her, right?

431
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,460
When she was little,
she used to brag before me

432
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,980
that she had elder brothers and sisters.

433
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,140
And she threatened me

434
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,780
to buy the craft pieces she made.

435
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,140
If not, she would disown me.

436
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,980
I can tell that is something
Ruanruan would do.

437
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,620
I saw childhood photos
of you and Ruanruan

438
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,100
when I was in her room.

439
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,660
I remember there are two boys
in the photos.

440
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,260
They're Xizhou and Yunshen.

441
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,740
Ruanruan seems to have married
one of them.

442
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,020
Luckily, you don't.

443
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,060
Why?

444
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,540
Did I say something wrong?

445
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,660
No.

446
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,460
I mean...

447
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,100
Honestly, I have good feelings for you.

448
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,940
So, I'm glad that you're single.

449
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,060
Well,

450
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,460
I'm rather straightforward.

451
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,900
I hope you don't mind

452
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,180
and don't think

453
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,860
that I'm being rude.

454
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,100
Not at all.

455
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,260
Well, I'm relieved.

456
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,340
I'll go and buy a bottle of red wine.

457
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,900
What do you want to drink?

458
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,020
Anything is fine.

459
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,180
Great.

460
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,940
The steamed fish is ready.

461
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,700
I'll cut them.

462
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,260
Hold on, Granny.

463
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,140
Right away.

464
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,260
You've cut them so well.

465
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,060
You do know how to do this.

466
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,100
My grandpa

467
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,660
loves cooking.

468
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,420
He always wants me to cook with him.

469
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,100
Naturally, I've learned how to cook.

470
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,180
Your grandpa loves cooking?

471
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:39,820
You know what?

472
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,340
My grandpa is adorable.

473
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,460
He never eats his own dishes,

474
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,580
but he'd force me to eat them.

475
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,380
He forces you?

476
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,620
Let me do this.

477
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,380
You must be close

478
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,220
to your grandpa, right?

479
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,740
I was raised by my grandpa.

480
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,020
Therefore,

481
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,780
I have a lot to share with Zhu Jiu

482
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,020
when it comes to this.

483
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,700
Zhu Jiu told me,

484
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,620
Granny,

485
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,340
you're her most loved one.

486
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,860
Granny.

487
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,060
Do you know how jealous I am of you?

488
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,860
You're jealous of me?

489
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,260
What are you talking about?

490
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,180
You look so happy.

491
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,620
What are we talking about?

492
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,220
Look, how's the egg I batter?

493
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,700
Pretty good.

494
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,780
We're talking about you.

495
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,580
Badmouthing me?

496
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,500
We're praising you.

497
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,620
Really?

498
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,140
Granny.

499
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,700
Is there anything I can help with?

500
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,900
Go and take a rest.

501
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,940
The kitchen is already packed.

502
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,140
Go and wait outside.

503
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,100
Dinner will be ready soon.

504
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,300
You've been working the whole day.

505
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:41,980
Put your feet up

506
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,260
and wait for my dinner.

507
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,620
Do you despise my cooking?

508
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,380
How can that be?

509
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,660
You need to give me a chance
to impress Granny,

510
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,420
right?

511
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,500
Good luck, then.

512
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,460
Okay.

513
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:55,980
Granny.

514
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,780
Let me show you my cooking skills.

515
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,100
Not many young people

516
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,540
really cook nowadays.

517
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,420
Indeed.

518
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,300
They should be encouraged

519
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,860
to treat their parents better

520
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,300
even though they're busy
and tired from working.

521
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,940
And learn to take care of themselves.

522
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,740
Yes, that's right.

523
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,740
What are you looking for?

524
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,620
Initially, I wanted to search and see

525
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,940
if there were any secrets.

526
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,500
Surprisingly, I didn't find
any idol photocards here.

527
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,300
I was studying so hard back
in my school days.

528
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,060
How would I have time for those?

529
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,860
I don't believe it.

530
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,060
You must have someone you like

531
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,780
during your teenage years.

532
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,580
Why do you want
to dig into my teenage years?

533
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,780
You must be up to no good.

534
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,300
I'm curious about you.

535
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,900
I'm thinking

536
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,460
about your past
that made you someone you are today.

537
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,140
Did you have any crush?

538
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,420
Have you crazily adored a star?

539
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,380
What kind of boys
did young Zhu Jiu like?

540
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,060
A bookish one or an athletic one?

541
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
Or...

542
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,820
I prefer someone like Fu Yunshen.

543
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,540
Happy now?

544
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,940
Yes. A perfect score for this answer.

545
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,700
Come with me.

546
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,780
Where are we going?

547
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,060
Wait for me here.

548
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,620
I'll get a designated driver

549
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,500
to send you home.

550
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,140
No need.

551
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,340
It's late now.

552
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,820
I'll send you home.

553
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,420
It's okay.

554
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,820
I've hailed a car.

555
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,620
Thank you for the dinner.

556
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,860
Can we meet again?

557
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,100
I'm sorry.

558
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,700
It's not your problem,

559
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,980
but mine.

560
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,660
I'm just not ready for this.

561
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,980
I'm truly sorry.

562
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,460
It's fine.

563
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,940
I'll head home, then.

564
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,780
Bye-bye.

565
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,780
Bye-bye.

566
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,020
He has left?

567
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,020
Granny.

568
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,740
What do you think about Yunshen?

569
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,820
What do you think about him?

570
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,300
He's pretty good, right?

571
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,980
That's good enough, then.

572
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,980
Your own feelings matter the most.

573
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,940
Thank you, Granny.

574
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,540
You're the best.

575
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,740
Yunshen can cook very well.

576
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,740
This young man

577
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,340
takes good care of himself.

578
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,100
I think,

579
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,820
after you two get married,

580
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,980
he'll take good care of you.

581
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,580
Granny.

582
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,100
What are you talking about?

583
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,060
Am I not right?

584
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,260
Granny.

585
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,740
I don't want

586
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,180
to marry anyone.

587
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,100
I just want to be your kid forever.

588
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,100
Silly girl.

589
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Even if you get married,
you're still my kid.

590
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,300
Always.

591
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,500
My darling.

592
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,340
Besides,
I'll have a grandson-in-law too.

593
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
You're right.

594
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,580
Darling.

595
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,660
You lost your parents
when you were little.

596
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,460
And I can't stay by your side forever.

597
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,380
Now, there's a man who loves you

598
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,500
and holds you dearly.

599
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,620
I'm really happy

600
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,620
and relieved.

601
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,820
Very well.

602
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,660
What does she want?

603
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,540
Tell me.

604
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:44,980
Mom.

605
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,620
When does it snow in Shanghai?

606
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,700
Gosh.

607
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,780
There's no snow in summer.

608
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,300
But all of my classmates have seen snow.

609
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,540
They laughed at me

610
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,820
for not seeing it before.

611
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,140
Just ignore them.

612
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,380
It's June now, it doesn't snow.

613
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,140
Continue.

614
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,220
Wang, drive.

615
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,820
Zhizhi, make your wish now.

616
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,660
Zhizhi, make your wish now.

617
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,980
You can't say the third wish out loud,

618
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,140
or it won't come true.

619
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,500
My first wish is

620
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,780
I hope to see snow today.

621
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,260
My second wish is

622
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,980
I hope to see snow today.

623
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,380
My third wish is...

624
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,060
Xizhou.

625
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,500
It doesn't snow in June, right?

626
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,540
Yes.

627
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,860
There's no snow in June.

628
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,340
It never snows in June.

629
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:51,940
Zhizhi.

630
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,460
You're dumb.

631
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,260
Don't you dare bully Zhizhi!

632
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,140
Fu Xizhou.

633
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,300
It was triggering me

634
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,060
after you beat me last time.

635
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,460
So, I went for a triage

636
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,780
and consulted with a lawyer.

637
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,180
The lawyer told me

638
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,260
that my injury was serious.

639
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,020
The bill for my emotional damage
and injury

640
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,780
should be this figure, at least.

641
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,820
How much?

642
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,540
One million.

643
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,580
It's fine.

644
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,220
On my phone,

645
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,660
there are two recordings.

646
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,940
They are solid evidence.

647
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,260
Sure.

648
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,340
Think it through.

649
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,940
If you don't give me the money,

650
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,540
I'll send them
to Fu Lingtian immediately.

651
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,500
You think it through.

652
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,780
If he were to know you beat Fu Yunshen,

653
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,220
how do you think
he would deal with this?

654
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,300
I have nothing to fear.

655
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,980
You forced me to do this.

656
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,540
Mr. Fu is aware

657
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,700
of your ruthlessness.

658
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,340
I wouldn't defy your order.

659
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,460
As long as you're aware
of my ruthlessness.

660
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,100
Fu Xizhou!

661
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,940
Don't you force me.

662
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,540
Otherwise, you'll regret it!

663
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:40,900
What are you doing?

664
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,620
You...

665
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,340
What are you doing?

666
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,020
Fu Xizhou!

667
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,820
You won't get away with this.

668
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,780
Are you done?

669
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,540
Almost.

670
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,220
Come with me.

671
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,820
Do you want the red, blue,

672
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,820
or striped tie?

673
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,340
Either one will do.

674
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,740
The red tie looks better.

675
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,860
Lower a bit.

676
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,740
Yunshen came to me
at the gallery yesterday.

677
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,340
He asked if there was
any misunderstanding between you two.

678
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,620
Did anything happen between you two?

679
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,220
I'll do it myself.

680
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:03,860
Nothing.

681
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,820
Let's have a meal with him
when we're free.

682
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,140
It's been some time since our wedding.

683
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,780
He hasn't given me any wedding gift yet.

684
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,260
I must claim it from him.

685
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,580
We'll see.

686
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,620
It's almost time.

687
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,140
I have a meeting this morning.

688
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,140
I'm off.

689
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,020
Well, drive safe.

690
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,700
I will.

691
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,420
Remember to go to my parents' house
for dinner tonight.

692
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,180
What's the matter?

693
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,780
It's about Ms. Jiang's nephew,
Jiang Jun.

694
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,430
Since he's transferred

695
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,320
to the Storage
and Transportation Department,

696
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,690
he never follows
the reimbursement procedure

697
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,420
at the end of each month.

698
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,820
Besides, he uses Lingtian's name

699
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,620
to scam people.

700
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,980
The department manager
has asked several times

701
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,380
how to handle him.

702
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,780
Let him be.

703
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,100
Cover him if possible.

704
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,620
All right, got it.

705
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,820
Come in.

706
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,660
Aunt.

707
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,660
Why do you come here

708
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,860
instead of working?

709
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,260
Aunt.

710
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,140
I brought you good news.

711
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,500
And this needs your help.

712
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,060
Aunt, a friend of mine

713
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,780
is in the cold chain logistics business.

714
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,380
Their quote is way lower than

715
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,380
the company
we're currently collaborating with.

716
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,540
Since the contract

717
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,460
is due soon,

718
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,740
why don't you consider
changing to another one?

719
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,060
This is a great chance

720
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,580
to cut down the company's expenses.

721
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,140
What's the name of that company?

722
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,340
Chuantai Cold Chain.

723
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,540
Mr. Cheng of that company

724
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,020
used to work

725
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,660
at the world's biggest
cold chain company before.

726
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,180
Now he has started his own business

727
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,220
and has collaborated
with many massive companies.

728
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,260
Is he reliable?

729
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,180
Of course.

730
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,940
Aunt, you can meet with him first.

731
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,820
You're always good at assessing people.

732
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,620
He is not able to deceive you.

733
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,830
Set up a meeting with your friend later.

734
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,350
Okay.

735
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,910
I'll make the arrangements now.

736
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,510
What are you looking at?

737
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,430
You look happy.

738
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,670
Mom, look at this.

739
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,110
Adorable, right?

740
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,870
Yes.

741
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,230
What a chubby baby.

742
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,110
Do you want a baby now?

743
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,430
No.

744
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,990
Xizhou and I are busy with work.

745
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,390
We don't have time to think about this.

746
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,590
Well, the soup is here.

747
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:20,190
Here.

748
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:21,870
Mom.

749
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,150
Careful.

750
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,390
It's hot.

751
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:28,830
Let's eat.

752
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,750
Don't just eat the dishes before you.

753
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,110
All the dishes Mom prepared
are delicious.

754
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,070
Don't miss them.

755
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,550
True.

756
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,030
Here, eat this.

757
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,470
Have more if you like it.

758
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,390
Here, Ruanruan.

759
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,430
Thank you, Mom.

760
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,510
You're married now,

761
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,110
yet you act like a child.

762
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:50,790
Xizhou.

763
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,030
You've been married for quite some time.

764
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,510
Have you thought about having a child?

765
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,550
You can have children earlier.

766
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,390
So that Ruanruan can recover faster.

767
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,630
If you're busy with your work,

768
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,710
I can look after the baby for you.

769
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,510
Mom.

770
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,030
We don't have such a plan
for the time being.

771
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,710
They're still young.

772
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,310
And Ruanruan still acts like a child.

773
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,310
Besides, Xizhou needs
to focus on his career.

774
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,750
It's better to wait for some years.

775
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,950
That's right, Mom.

776
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,310
We don't have a plan as of now.

777
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,590
Honey, are you happy today?

778
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,270
Yes.

779
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,390
I'll sing you a song.

780
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:44,990
You're happy?

781
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,710
♪I pick a coin by the street♪

782
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,470
♪And I give it to the police officer♪

783
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,310
What's wrong?

784
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,270
Are you thinking about
not having a child?

785
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,550
I know

786
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,470
you were caught off guard

787
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,670
when Mom mentioned that.

788
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,230
But you talked

789
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,510
as if you never wanted to have a child.

790
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,830
We never said
that we didn't want a child,

791
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:16,510
no?

792
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,270
Ruanruan.

793
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,510
Raising a child
requires a lot of time and effort.

794
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,030
I think

795
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,710
I'm not prepared yet.

796
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,950
If you don't have time,
I can do it myself.

797
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,790
If we have a child,
I'll resign from work.

798
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,310
I'll stay at home
to look after the baby.

799
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,670
You don't have to worry about that.

800
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,950
It's not
that our child doesn't have a father.

801
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,510
Why must you bear this alone?

802
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,940
So, you want a child, don't you?

803
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,620
But it's not the time yet.

804
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,260
When?

805
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,980
I don't know.

806
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,460
Did you send Sun Cheng to Heidelberg?

807
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,940
Who are you?

808
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,660
You don't have to know who I am.

809
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,100
Mark in Heidelberg,

810
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,180
you've heard of this name, right?

811
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,180
Yes.

812
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,580
Are you involved

813
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,500
in my assault?

814
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,260
Maybe.

815
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,740
Why?

816
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,900
Answer me.

817
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,100
I asked you not to return to Shanghai,

818
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,820
but you never listened.

819
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,780
Just because of this?

820
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,060
Yes.

821
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,180
I couldn't even stand up,

822
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,820
and I wasn't involved in the company
at that time.

823
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,860
I posed no threats to you.

824
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,220
Your presence alone

825
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,380
is a threat to me.

826
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,380
Xizhou.

827
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,140
I've never wanted

828
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,940
to compete with you.

829
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,740
