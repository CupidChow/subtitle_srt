But you used my identity
without telling me.

Whatever reason you have,

388
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,470
I just can't understand.

389
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,030

No.

Yeah.

You've been deep and shrewd
since you were little.

420
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,950
Back then,

421
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,030
I failed to consider everything.

422
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,390
So, your mother fell sick

423
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,670
and your father died of depression.

424
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,350
But over all these years,

425
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,870

at the age of five,

430
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,990
you've been one of the family.

431
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,790
Think about it.

432
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,790
I've always been treating you fairly.

433
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,430
You keep saying I'm one of the family.

434
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,910
But actually,

435
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,590
everything I did for Yunshen,
you took it for granted.

436
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,030
And everything he did for me,

even the tiniest thing,

438
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,230

to engrave it in my heart.

For her, I'm sorry.

to say sorry.

450
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,390
If you really felt sorry,

451
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,390
