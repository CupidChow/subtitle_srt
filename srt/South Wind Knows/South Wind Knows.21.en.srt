00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,500
Sure.

193
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,580
Ruanruan can get her own food.

194
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,900
She's not a guest.

195
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,980
Look at her.

196
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,300
She's lost so much weight.

197
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,220
She even looked strained.

198
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,540
Is it fatigue from work?

199
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,700
Or did Xizhou mistreat you?

200
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,020
No.

201
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,700
I've been buried under a pile of work.

202
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,060
Give it a rest.

203
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,340
You always think
Xizhou bullies Ruanruan.

204
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,700
You always worry too much.

205
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,420
It was as though you wished

206
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,900
for her to get bullied.

207
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,100
Don't bring your work demeanor

208
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,900
back home,

209
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,500
okay?

210
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,180
You always get overly critical.

211
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,580
Can't I express my concern for her?

212
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,500
All right.

213
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,260
Honey.

214
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,060
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,260
I misspoke.

216
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:27,660
Mom.

217
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,700
Dad is always so quick
to admit his mistakes.

218
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,780
Don't let him fool you.

219
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,820
Trust me,

220
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,180
all men admit their mistakes

221
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,140
but they never change.

222
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,380
Now, who is being overly critical here?

223
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,100
See?

224
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,940
I told you so.

225
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,740
Okay.

226
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,860
Bring the bowl here.

227
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,020
I only want the soup.

228
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,340
Sure. A bowl of soup for you.

229
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,620
Okay, that's enough for me.

230
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,460
- You need more.
- That's enough.

231
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Mr. Fu.

232
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,500
Sorry

233
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,900
for the long wait.

234
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,260
It's all right.

235
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,020
After all, Dr. Zhu is busy.

236
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,300
Why didn't you get changed?

237
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,060
Sorry.

238
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,700
Let me make it up to you.

239
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,740
How will you do that?

240
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,060
Please come with me.

241
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,980
Hot...

242
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,620
Boss.

243
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,100
Enjoy the food.

244
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,900
Dr. Zhu.

245
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,140
Is this your way of making it up to me?

246
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,460
I knew it wouldn't be enough.

247
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,900
Very well, I'll show you my most prized

248
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,380
snacks.

249
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,940
I hope you like them, sir.

250
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,060
A little extra for the noodles.

251
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,060
These are your prized snacks?

252
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,340
Do you eat these every day?

253
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,420
Try it out.

254
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,940
Well, stop eating these.

255
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,100
They lack nutrients.

256
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,740
But I am a little hungry.

257
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,540
I can't get it off.

258
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,580
Just take a bite.

259
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,260
Okay.

260
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,740
By the way,

261
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,060
how are things between you
and your brother?

262
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,580
Things are still bad.

263
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,740
Have some sauce.

264
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,700
Never mind.

265
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,500
I'm full.

266
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,500
I'm full.

267
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,780
Let's travel, okay?

268
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,420
We can go to Kenya and see animals

269
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,860
or...

270
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,580
the South Pole for the penguins.

271
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,660
Or we could

272
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,340
go to the North Pole for the aurora.

273
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:19,980
What do you think?

274
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,660
If we traveled as you proposed,

275
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,060
we'd both be unemployed.

276
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,780
You have annual leaves.

277
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,260
Only five days a year.

278
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,380
I might not even get to use them.

279
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,340
Well, I must pray for world peace,

280
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,500
good health,

281
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,900
and no more diseases.

282
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,180
Otherwise, my girlfriend

283
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,900
might never get to be on a vacation
with me.

284
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,860
That's a good wish.

285
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,260
Are you working overtime this weekend?

286
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,300
Not on the weekend.

287
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,980
Are you taking me to the penguins?

288
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,980
I think

289
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,940
I should officially introduce you

290
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,780
to my grandpa and mom.

291
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,460
But...

292
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,340
I'm not ready yet.

293
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,540
Zhu Jiu.

294
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,780
Just be yourself.

295
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:28,740
Besides,

296
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,300
you're a likable person.

297
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,580
I've seen your grandma.

298
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,580
Okay.

299
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,900
Very well.

300
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,180
I'll pick you up this weekend.

301
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,820
You're acting like a kid.

302
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,020
Wait...

303
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,020
What is it?

304
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,980
A child?

305
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,900
A great shot.

306
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,620
This is for you.

307
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,780
What is this?

308
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,500
It's almost

309
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,460
your second anniversary.

310
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,620
[Customized Honeymoon]
You insisted on not having a wedding

311
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,540
and held a small ceremony instead.

312
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,340
I find it regretful,

313
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,420
but

314
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,060
I respect your decision.

315
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,780
But you must go on your honeymoon.

316
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,660
It's what we want for you.

317
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,540
What's wrong?

318
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,500
Is Xizhou too busy to even go on

319
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,660
a honeymoon?

320
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,020
I'll talk to him.

321
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,980
Mom.

322
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,220
That's not it.

323
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,060
I was just thinking.

324
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,540
I've been so busy this month.

325
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,180
When will I ever get the time?

326
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:54,980
Really?

327
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,580
Mom.

328
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
You've been in love with Dad
for decades.

329
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,700
Has he ever kept any secrets from you?

330
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,380
Your dad?

331
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,180
He has more than a secret or two.

332
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,380
Really?

333
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,300
Aren't you concerned?

334
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,140
There is a saying.

335
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,500
Keep your eyes open
before getting married,

336
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,740
and keep one eye shut

337
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,540
after you get married.

338
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,980
Therefore,

339
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,020
as long as he doesn't cross the line,

340
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,900
I

341
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,220
choose not to know.

342
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,460
But it must be hard to do that.

343
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,060
You're still going to think about it.

344
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,220
It is hard indeed.

345
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,020
Therefore,

346
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,700
a marriage is more complicated
than a relationship.

347
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,260
When you are in love,

348
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,180
it's about that person you love.

349
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,780
After you get married,

350
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,140
it's about you and his family,

351
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,260
and his entire life experience.

352
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,980
Why the sudden interest in this topic?

353
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,580
Did you have a fight with Xizhou?

354
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,260
No.

355
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,380
I've been working on

356
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,180
an exhibition about marriage.

357
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,500
I interviewed a lot of married couples.

358
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,700
I thought
I should interview you and Dad as well.

359
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,620
Really?

360
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,220
Great.

361
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,300
Get working.

362
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,820
Good night, Mom.

363
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,740
Good night.

364
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,900
Here, have some milk.

365
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,020
I'll put it here.

366
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,700
What's wrong?

367
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,020
I think something is off

368
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,540
about our daughter today.

369
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,540
She was fine during dinner, no?

370
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,900
But she asked a bunch of questions

371
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,380
about marriage.

372
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,140
Maybe she

373
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,820
had a fight with Xizhou.

374
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,580
Every married couple fights.

375
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,500
Don't overreact.

376
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,100
Stay out of their relationship

377
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,940
unless you want to make things worse.

378
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,780
But I think it's more than
just a small quarrel.

379
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,300
You know your daughter.

380
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,900
She is always so carefree
and never afraid to speak her mind.

381
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,100
But she is keeping things to herself.

382
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,500
She wouldn't even tell me.

383
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,980
Maybe Xizhou was too busy
and didn't pay her

384
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,180
enough attention.

385
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,460
Not to mention his father is ill.

386
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,340
He could be retiring soon.

387
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,580
Now is the critical time
for Xizhou's career.

388
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,180
Talk to Ruanruan.

389
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,620
We need to know more.

390
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,540
All you men ever talk about is career.

391
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,260
Does your family mean nothing to you?

392
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,380
All right.

393
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,220
I'll reprimand Xizhou when I see him.

394
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,700
I'll order him to make time

395
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,340
for Ruanruan.

396
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,260
That's more like it.

397
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,180
Finish your milk.

398
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,740
I'm going to bed.

399
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,460
I'll play for a little while.

400
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,700
Mom.

401
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,540
What are you doing here?

402
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,700
Waiting for you.

403
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,300
Waiting for me?

404
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,220
I asked Miss Tao
to prepare tonic dishes.

405
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,020
I'll get it.

406
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,220
Never mind.

407
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,220
Is there anything you need?

408
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,740
You weren't at the dinner.

409
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,380
Mr. Zhou and Mrs. Zhou were upset.

410
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,060
I've been too busy lately.

411
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,980
I'll apologize to them

412
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,660
in person later.

413
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,460
Don't try to brush me off.

414
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,620
Yunshen.

415
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,860
To win a fight against Fu Xizhou,

416
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,140
the Zhou family
is your greatest reinforcement.

417
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,940
I can tell

418
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,380
Zhizhi is still the same as before.

419
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,300
Be more proactive

420
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,460
and ask her out more often.

421
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,060
Mom.

422
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,980
I have a girlfriend.

423
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,620
Why should I ask her out?

424
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,900
Isn't it normal for young people
to go through breakups

425
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,020
and get back together?

426
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Besides, you're not married yet.

427
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,460
Mom.

428
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,420
Well...

429
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,860
I plan to bring Zhu Jiu home for dinner

430
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,260
this weekend.

431
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,100
Is that okay?

432
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,460
Sure.

433
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,500
You used to bring your friends
and classmates home

434
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,540
for dinner as well.

435
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,580
Mom.

436
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,220
She is my girlfriend.

437
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,340
I want to introduce her
to you and Grandpa.

438
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,580
Grandpa said yes.

439
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,380
I don't mind if you have a girlfriend.

440
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,780
But a marriage concerns two families.

441
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,780
Zhizhi is more suitable for you.

442
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,380
Mom.

443
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,300
Suitable or not,

444
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,980
you must first understand Zhu Jiu.

445
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,700
Can't you at least give her a chance?

446
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,500
Mom.

447
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,860
I promised you to fight

448
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,260
for the right to be the heir.

449
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,940
Can you be considerate?

450
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,380
Are you making a deal
with your own mother?

451
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,220
No.

452
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,580
I wouldn't dare.

453
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,300
Mom.

454
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,380
For me,

455
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,740
you are important.

456
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
But so is Zhu Jiu.

457
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,180
Mom.

458
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,460
Please say yes.

459
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,700
Let's go upstairs and get Miss Tao's...

460
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,100
Fine.

461
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,340
I take that as a yes.

462
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,020
Let's go.

463
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,620
I'll eat all the tonic dishes.

464
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,300
Let's go.

465
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,300
Push me there.

466
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,300
Get up!

467
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,660
Getting up.

468
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,660
[Lymphoma Vaccine]

469
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,380
Thank you.

470
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,140
That's all.

471
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,580
We made a grand and extravagant display

472
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,940
with the Perdo Project.

473
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,060
We saw no results after two years.

474
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,460
Now, the research is
going in a different direction.

475
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,660
The investor is going to question

476
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,300
the R&D capability of Lingtian

477
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,740
and its management.

478
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,460
Scientific research is always changing.

479
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,660
A change in the project is no issue.

480
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,940
What matters is
how to get the most profits.

481
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,140
Mr. Fu.

482
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,740
What do you think?

483
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,100
I agree with Mr. Liu and Mr. Gu.

484
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,540
Mr. Fu Jr.

485
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,900
You are too idealistic.

486
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,180
Also, you are too optimistic

487
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,740
and idealistic

488
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,380
about certain matters.

489
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,660
Fu Xizhou,

490
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,860
what does that mean?

491
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,220
I mean it literally.

492
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,220
During the project meeting of DPN,

493
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,580
you said the same thing you said today.

494
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,700
In the end,

495
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,460
that caused nothing
but trouble for the R&D

496
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,940
and marketing departments.

497
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,340
It hasn't been made available,

498
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,060
what is there for the marketing department
to worry about?

499
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,820
If you want to intervene
with the R&D department,

500
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,340
find a better excuse.

501
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,340
Ms. Jiang.

502
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,220
Let Xizhou finish.

503
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,740
Since it's a hot potato,

504
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,820
we must as well discard it.

505
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,660
A foreign pharmaceutical company
contacted me.

506
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,460
They want to make
a complete acquisition of this project.

507
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,180
When that's done,

508
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,060
first off,

509
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,980
we can get back
our initial investment capital.

510
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,460
Secondly, we can make a profit.

511
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Two birds with one stone.

512
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,420
Yunshen! Stop!

513
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,820
Does beating me make you happy?

514
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,380
Keep it going.

515
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,500
Boss.

516
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,860
Calm down.

517
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,340
Are you done?

518
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,660
(Ruanruan.)

519
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,140
Why aren't you home yet?

520
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,140
Right away.

521
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,620
I'll leave after sorting these out.

522
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,100
Did you not drive here?

523
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,820
The weather forecast said it'd rain.

524
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,700
So, I didn't drive.

525
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,460
Let's go, my lovely lady.

526
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,820
I'll give you a lift home.

527
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,140
Never mind.

528
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
It's not along your way home.

529
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,860
I'll get a taxi. It won't take long.

530
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,740
Really?

531
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,100
Are you sure?

532
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,380
I'll be going now.

533
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:03,940
Go on.

534
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,060
Stay safe.

535
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,180
You too.

536
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:57,940
Let's go.

537
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,660
We go home.

538
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,380
(Pull over up ahead.)

539
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,540
Wait here.

540
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,340
What's the egg for?

541
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,060
To ease the swelling.

542
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,540
Who says a tea egg can do that?

543
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,260
A tea egg is still an egg.

544
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,140
Can you tell me how you hurt your face?

545
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,300
I had a fight with Fu Yunshen.

546
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,180
Is Fu Yunshen all right?

547
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,220
I know he's no match for you.

548
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:37,940
Come on.

549
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,980
You are supposed to eat the tea egg.

550
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,940
It doesn't work.

551
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,020
Do you want it or not?

552
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,220
Yes.

553
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,140
Open up.

554
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,820
Let's go home.

555
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,140
[Little Bunny]

556
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,620
Hello?

557
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,900
Mr. Fu?

558
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,580
You are acting strange today.

559
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,340
You'd usually video call me

560
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,580
whenever you have the time.

561
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,780
What happened today?

562
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,940
I'm preparing a meeting.

563
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,780
Working overtime tonight?

564
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,940
Of course.

565
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,540
We have had more work recently.

566
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,260
I won't be dropping by today.

567
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,140
See you this weekend.

568
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,460
Take care.

569
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,260
Don't skip your meals.

570
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,380
Understood.

571
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,340
You too.

572
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,380
- Bye.
- So...

573
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:13,060
[XZ RR]

574
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,700
You came.

575
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,540
Grandpa.

576
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,580
I need your signature on this document.

577
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,780
Are you all right?

578
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,900
Yeah.

579
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,700
You started a fight
in front of the board members.

580
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,100
You and your brother
are quite something.

581
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,500
Let's talk about you

582
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,500
first.

583
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,260
You've always kept your composure.

584
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,060
Sorry

585
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,900
for making you worry.

586
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,220
Me? Worried?

587
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,460
You two are adults.

588
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,180
Even if you want a fight,

589
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,820
pick a different time and place.

590
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,340
You had a fallout

591
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,100
because of a project.

592
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,140
Is it necessary?

593
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,580
Didn't you have better things to do?

594
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,540
Don't you need to make more money?

595
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,740
I merely expressed my opinion.

596
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,940
It was business.

597
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,060
You taught me that.

598
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,060
That is correct.

599
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,260
But specific circumstances
need a specific analysis.

600
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,700
Enough.

601
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,260
Stay out of the Perdo Project.

602
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,660
Leave it to Yunshen.

603
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,500
Grandpa.

604
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,820
The company

605
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,540
is doing well.

606
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,580
One more project

607
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,980
won't do any harm.

608
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,940
Yunshen's mother sent me

609
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,300
his project proposal.

610
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,700
I think the research on a cancer vaccine

611
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,220
is very promising.

612
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,580
With proper effort,

613
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,700
we will have support from the nation.

614
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,700
Understood.

615
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,940
Don't bother asking

616
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,740
for my signature on these documents.

617
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,260
Use your signature.

618
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,700
Thanks, Grandpa.

619
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,140
Remember.

620
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,060
Yunshen

621
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,020
is your brother, not your enemy.

622
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,300
With you two working as one,

623
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,500
Lingtian

624
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,180
will continue to exist.

625
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,220
In-fighting
will bring the whole company down.

626
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,380
Is that clear?

627
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,100
Yes.

628
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,260
Grandpa.

629
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,500
I must go now.

630
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,860
Boss.

631
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,060
Good news.

632
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,300
The board denied

633
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,020
Fu Xizhou's proposal
to sell the Perdo Project.

634
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,660
Understood.

635
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:04,900
Boss.

636
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,980
Were you all right yesterday?

637
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,620
Shut it.

638
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,780
I'm showing my concern.

639
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,860
You and Xizhou...

640
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,780
Do you want the world

641
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,180
to know we had a fight?

642
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,700
I wouldn't want that,

643
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,380
but people already know.

644
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,780
Not a word to Dr. Zhu.

645
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,420
Sure.

646
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,700
What's wrong?

647
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,700
Dr. Ji.

648
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,820
Fu Yunshen invited me over
to his home for dinner.

649
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,420
That's great news.

650
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,820
So, why the long face?

651
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,340
I'm nervous.

652
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,140
Nervous?

653
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,540
Worse than taking an exam?

654
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,580
Of course, it's worse.

655
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,900
At least I control my fate in an exam.

656
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,620
I know my chances.

657
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,780
But

658
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,580
things are different
with meeting his family.

659
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,900
You're an outstanding person.

660
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,140
The elderly will adore you.

661
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,180
But his mom doesn't like me.

662
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,980
And she is wrong about you.

663
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,020
I'm a little scared of her.

664
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,660
Scared of her?

665
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,540
What did she do?

666
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,660
(This is your payment and bonuses.)

667
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,900
This is too much.

668
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,620
Consider the extra

669
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,180
a token of goodwill from a mother.

670
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:39,740
Sure.

671
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,060
Thank you, Mrs. Fu.

672
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,220
Yunshen doesn't need
a house doctor anymore.

673
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,340
It's not ideal for you to live here.

674
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,660
I asked Linda

675
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,180
to pack up your things.

676
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,100
Mrs. Fu.

677
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,140
I know you don't like me.

678
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,820
But I hope you can give me a chance.

679
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,940
Not in a million years.

680
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,100
I wouldn't like someone

681
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,300
who caused harm to my son.

682
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,940
He could have recovered

683
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,940
and gone home.

684
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,380
But because of you,

685
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,020
he's keeping secrets from me.

686
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,540
Sorry.

687
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,060
Dr. Zhu.

688
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,420
If you actually feel a tint of guilt,

689
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,540
please leave him.

690
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,660
Dr. Zhu.

691
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,900
This is a warning

692
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,460
to make you come to your senses.

693
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,180
If you keep pestering Yunshen,

694
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,380
luck won't be on your side
the next time.

695
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,940
Have you lost your mind?

696
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,220
Any mother who sees her son

697
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,540
almost get beaten to death

698
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,420
because of a woman

699
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,980
(will lose it.)

700
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,900
It's the kind of fear

701
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,100
a girlfriend would have
of her boyfriend's mother.

702
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,580
Get it?

703
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,700
Mint.

704
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,740
Stop worrying.

705
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,060
Focus on being yourself.

706
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,020
Yunshen said the same to me.

707
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,300
All the more reason not to worry.

708
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,980
Remember one thing.

709
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,700
Does he love you too?

710
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,820
If the answer is yes,

711
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,420
he will clear all the obstacles for you.

712
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:09,900
Yes.

713
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,980
Dr. Ji, you are absolutely right.

714
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,260
I can leave everything to him.

715
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,660
