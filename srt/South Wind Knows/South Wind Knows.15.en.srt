00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,900
It was a legitimate defense.

191
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,500
He attacked me.

192
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,300
That's what you said.

193
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,260
Do you have a witness

194
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,780
or other evidence?

195
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,220
No.

196
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,380
But he punched me.

197
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,740
See. Here, this is evidence.

198
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,940
Mark is hurt worse than you.

199
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,500
And he said you hit him first.

200
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,420
He's lying!

201
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,100
Wait!

202
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,940
Could you check the surveillance camera?

203
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,980
I'm sorry, miss.

204
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,740
You should hurry
and contact your lawyer.

205
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,700
Ms. Zhu, call.

206
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,000

(Please redial later.)

210
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,420
I think you can't contact your lawyer.

211
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,980
Then you will have to
spend the night here.

212
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,380
Only if you have come up with evidence.

213
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,140
Please bring her some water and food.

214
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,420

Okay.

219
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,620
Ms. Zhu, it's for you.

Can you come back
when you have the time?

225
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,100
Wutong hasn't been eating well
these few days.

226
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,300
Please do me a favor, okay?

227

But can you do me a favor first?

229
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,500
What's the matter?

230
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,180
I'm at the police station now.

231
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,340
Mr. Fu.

232
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,020
Dr. Zhu is in trouble.

233
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,060
She was nearly raped
and got falsely accused.

234
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,540
She's locked up in the station now.

235
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,980
She needs a lawyer.

236
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,620
Can we help her?

237
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,140

238
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,060
But her situation is urgent.

239
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,620
Mint said she is being falsely accused.

240
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
I said I hear you.

241
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:17,900
Alright.

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,780
Mr. Fu!

243
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
Mr. Fu, are you alright?

244
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,420
Are you hurt?

245
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,460
Mr. Fu fell down.

246
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900

00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,180
was accidentally taken by Linda

377
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,940
when she made Yunshen's bed.

378
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,100
Though, it's a fact
I didn't give it to you.

379
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,500
And that call from a year ago.

380
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,340
Yunshen was in a coma at the time.

381
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,220
Why are you telling me all this?

382
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,020
Because I have always liked him.

383
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,500
I have liked him since I was very,

384
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,900
very young.

385
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,380
I was naive enough to think

386
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,740
that I just had to take the initiative

387
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,780
and try harder.

388
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,940
And one day,
he would realize the good in me.

389
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,140
But when he heard you were in danger,

390
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,220
he got so worried
that he fell from the stairs.

391
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,300
From that moment on,

392
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,820
I knew he would never love me.

393
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,980
Is he alright?

394
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,220
Don't worry.

395
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,420
He's alright now.

396
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,220
That's good.

397
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,340
Zhu Jiu.

398
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,740
Yunshen needs a lot of help now.

399
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,180
He needs you.

400
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,460
Zhizhi.

401
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,580

00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,380
(How are you getting along
with Yunshen?)

421
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,700
(Is he willing to come back?)

422
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,900
(Yunshen is...)

423
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,180
(Stay there with him
a little longer, then.)

424
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,540
(You two can get closer.)

425
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,900
(Madam Jiang.)

426
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,980
(Yunshen already has a girlfriend.)

427
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,860
(What?)

428
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,620
(A girlfriend?)

429
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,540
- (When did...)
- (Madam Jiang.)

430
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,140
(I have to catch my flight.)

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,220
(I'll talk to you again.)

♪All I yearn for

Zhu Jiu.

435
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,220
If we get together,

436
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,940
you might have a hard time
in the future.

437
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,020
Will it be tougher
than getting into medical school?

438
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,340
Will it be tougher
than being alone and helpless

439
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,020
in the hunting cave in Country M?

440
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,060
Yes, more than that.

441
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,780
Well, that's great.

442
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,340
I love challenges.

443
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:34,740
Zhu Jiu.

444
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,460
You love sports.

445
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,820
But I can't go for morning runs
with you.

446
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,700
Didn't you know?

447
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,700
I prefer
going for quiet morning runs alone.

448
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,060
I can't go hiking with you either.

449
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,420
I was never fond of hiking.

450
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,540
I love watching the sea,

451
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,700
the starry skies,

452
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,180
and the fireworks.

453
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,540
But when you are tired,

454
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,500
I won't be able to carry you.

455
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,380
When I am tired,

456
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,220
you just have to hold my hands tight,

457
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,620
and I'll slowly regain my energy.

458
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,700
I don't even have the strength
to hug you.

459
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,860
I love embracing each other even more.

460
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,420
Yunshen.

461
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,140
Did you know?

462
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,500
To me,

463
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,180
love isn't just about

464
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,300
sharing all the lovely moments.

465
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,460
It is also about sharing the hard times.

466
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,380
The things you said just now.

467
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,140
I'm not scared of any of them.

468
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,820
I'm just scared
that you will push me away

469
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,620
and bear everything on your own.

470
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,420
I'm sorry.

471
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,780
I don't need you to say sorry.

472
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,660
But I want you to promise me.

473
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,900
From now on,

474
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,340
we must shoulder everything together.

475
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,140
Okay.

476
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,780
Fu Yunshen, nice to meet you.

477
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,700
My name is Zhu Jiu.

478
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,900
"Zhu" as in red.

479
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,460
"Jiu" as in old.

480
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,780
Nice meeting you again.

481
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,820
My name is Fu Yunshen.

482
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,100
"Fu" as in tutor.

483
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,380
"Yunshen" as in foggy.

484
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,180
Zhu Jiu.

485
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,180
I'm really happy
to see you again as well.

486
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,980
I can't believe the vampire
has shown himself.

487
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,420
You look more like a vampire.

488
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,980
Looks like you're recovering well.

489
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,740
You can even joke now.

490
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,900
Is the Perdo experiment going well?

491
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,700
Obviously not.

492
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,660
Think about it.

493
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,660
Come and help me.

494
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,340
I want to sign up

495
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,100
for the OEC transplantation
at your hospital.

496
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,300
I know you.

497
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,900
As a researcher, I admire your decision.

498
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,540
But as your family,

499
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,100
I think you should reconsider.

500
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,180
I'm telling you now

501
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,220
because I have made up my mind.

502
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,220
Does Mint know?

503
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,900
I haven't told her.

504
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,900
Why not wait
till the surgery is successful?

505
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,540
I can then stand before her

506
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,100
and give her a surprise.

507
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,820
I am sure
Mint would feel the same as me.

508
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,340
That is to try and stop you.

509
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:58,740
Leo.

510
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,740
Don't tell anyone else
about the surgery.

511
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,420
Make sure you never tell Grandpa.

512
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,540
I don't want him to worry.

513
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,180
Okay.

514
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,220
What if something goes wrong?

515
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,220
Every surgery comes with risks.

516
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,940
What if you die?

517
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,460
I won't die so easily.

518
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,300
You've gone mad.

519
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,620
You've definitely gone mad.

520
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,140
I want you to keep it a secret

521
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,940
because I'm scared others
will get worried too.

522
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,020
I'm afraid
they will get hopeful like me,

523
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,460
only to be disappointed in the end.

524
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,940
Come on. Catch up!

525
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,020
Fu Yunshen!

526
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,020
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Hurry up.

527
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,660
Hurry!

528
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,380
I can't run anymore.

529
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,620
Seriously?

530
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,660
That's because yours is automatic.

531
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,780
Come on.

532
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,940
Watch out.

533
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,780
Pick up the speed.

534
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,700
Fu Yunshen,
you won't even let me catch a break

535
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,380
for a second, huh?

536
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,820
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

537
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,620
This way.

538
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,500
- Okay.
- Fu Yunshen!

539
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,540
- Thank you.
- Let me help you.

540
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:35,980
What?

541
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,740
You cheated. Are you trying to kill me?

542
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,780
Sit down. You must be tired.

543
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,540
That was cheating.

544
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,220
That's not.

545
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,500
I am one with the wheelchair.

546
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,660
If you say some nice things to me,

547
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,660
I will consider giving you a massage
when we get back.

548
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,420
A massage?

549
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,340
I don't say nice things.

550
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,300
Because you are so amazing.

551
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,220
I can't find better words
to compliment you.

552
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,460
You're such a sweet talker.

553
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,020
I must be more careful.

554
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,420
What if I let you escape by accident

555
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,020
and you seduce young girls?

556
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,300
What are you talking about?

557
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,060
Wait here.

558
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,060
I'll get you a drink.

559
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:29,700
It's hot.

560
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:30,860
That was quick.

561
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,860
The coffee here is delicious.

562
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,020
Are you guys happy?

563
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,220
Yes, we are.

564
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,140
Let's go, young man.

565
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,420
Zhu Jiu.

566
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,820
I have something to tell you.

567
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:08,940
Shoot.

568
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,820
I'm planning to undergo the surgery.

569
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,020
If I say

570
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,460
that I don't want you to do it,

571
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,500
you won't listen to me, right?

572
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,300
Even if I tell you

573
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,180
about the risks of getting the surgery,

574
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,660
it still won't change your mind, right?

575
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,220
If so, what's the point of telling me?

576
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,300
You might as well be over
with the surgery,

577
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,900
then surprise me by standing up.

578
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,300
Zhu Jiu.

579
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,980
I wish to be able to stand too.

580
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,340
Not just for you.

581
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,580
I know you don't mind my disability.

582
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,100
- But this concerns...
- I do mind.

583
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,820
I'm pretty annoyed with you now, though.

584
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,300
It's such a waste for me
to be in a wheelchair

585
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,620
with these long legs.

586
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,140
Zhu Jiu, wait for me.

587
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,540
After we quarrel each time,

588
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,500
I wish to walk away in style.

589
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,740
But

590
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,740
I'm in a wheelchair.

591
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,300
So I can only follow behind you.

592
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,220
Besides,

593
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,940
after quarreling with you,

594
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,100
and when I know

595
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,460
that you are really upset,

596
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,380
I wish to hold you in my arms.

597
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,180
But now, I can only hug you like this.

598
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,740
That is so not romantic.

599
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:45,940
Yunshen.

600
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,180
I'm sorry.

601
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,140
I can't weigh the pros and cons with you

602
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,660
while being in this relationship.

603
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,380
But I really can't lose you again.

604
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,900
I know that I am actually

605
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,940
quite annoying.

606
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,740
And you know me.

607
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,580
I don't want to give anyone more burden.

608
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,140
What if after a long time,

609
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,540
you find me annoying too,

610
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,220
and you don't like me anymore?

611
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,260
Even though

612
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,140
there is only a 0.01% chance of that,

613
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,740
I don't want to risk it.

614
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,540
It won't happen.

615
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,740
On top of that,

616
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,900
I want to be like others too.

617
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,860
I want to run and jump around

618
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,300
with my children.

619
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,460
You're shameless.

620
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,980
Who wants to have your kids?

621
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,900
Is that a no?

622
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,900
It's a no!

623
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,780
My wheelchair has run out of battery.

624
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,820
Come and push it for me.

625
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,180
Bye-bye!

626
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,540
Fu Yunshen, you are always lying.

627
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,100
Wait up!

628
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,740
