[Episode 22]

21
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,500
Granny.

22
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,820
Why are you still up? It's late now.

23
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,980
I've been waiting for you.

24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,900
Tomorrow,

25
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,860
you're going to visit Yunshen's family.

26
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,060
Bring them
to his grandfather and mother.

27
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,900
They are too precious.

28
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,900
I can't take them.

29
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,140
Just take them.

30
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,020
This is your first time
meeting his family.

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,020
You have to show proper manners.

32
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,140
Don't worry.

33
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,020
I'll prepare the present by myself.

34
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,020
You don't know about this.

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,580
Families like Yunshen's

36
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,020
lack nothing.

37
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,220
We can't afford hefty presents.

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,940
But as for these two Reishi Mushrooms,

39
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,820
I've been keeping them for many years.

40
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,020
They're considered presentable, I think.

41
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,380
It's a gift for them.

42
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,780
But you see them as your treasure

43
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,940
and you never eat them.

44
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,020
They sure are precious,

45
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,980
but the happiness of my granddaughter
is more precious.

46
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,540
Thank you, Granny.

47
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,220
No need to thank me.

48
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,860
Well, go to bed now.

49
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,660
Get enough rest

50
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,940

Okay.

My stomach hurts.

54
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,820
I don't think I can make it.

55
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,100
Your stomach hurts?

56
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,140
Why?

57
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,060
No idea.

58
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,180
I'll rub your stomach.

59
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,820
No.

60
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,700
It'll be more painful.

61

This is weird.

62
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,420
Get down.

63
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,820
You're nervous, aren't you?

64
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,460
Come on.

65
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,500

69

So, don't be nervous.

70
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,900
All right.

71
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,780
Let's go.

72
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,700
Let's go.

73
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,780
I need to remind you of something
before we enter.

74
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,660
If my grandpa prepares dinner today,

75
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,780
I'm afraid you...

76
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,420
Come here.

Where are you going?

80
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,100
What's wrong?

81
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,940
- Are you shy about seeing someone new?
- Hi, Wutong.

82
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,220
All right.

83
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,620
Come back.

84
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,500
Come back. Hey.

85
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,020
Yunshen, you're home.

Nice to meet you, Mr. Fu.

93
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,100
My name is Zhu Jiu.

94
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,220
Hello.

95
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,980
Finally, we meet.

96
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,820
Come here and sit.

97
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,500
Grandpa, where's Mom?

98
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,900
She's upstairs.

99
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,020
Something urgent came up at work
and she's dealing with it.

100
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,700
By the way.

101
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,220
Go upstairs and see
if she needs your help.

102
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,020
All right, I'll head upstairs.

103
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,860
You guys talk.

104
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,780
Have a seat.

105
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,580
Mr. Fu.

106
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,260
I've brought you a present.

107
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,620
Thank you so much.

108
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,660
By the way,

109
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,260
how did you two meet each other?

110
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,820
Mom.

111
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,780
Mom, it's me.

112
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,860
Come in.

113
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:55,900
Mom.

114
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,780
Zhu Jiu is downstairs.

115
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,900
Come down for dinner.

116
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,940
It's not the time yet.

117
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,180
But you promised
you'd have a meal together.

118
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,180
Mom.

119
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,500
Stop reading.

120
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,580
Come on.

121
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,100
Let's go and meet
your future daughter-in-law.

122
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,300
I'm having dinner
with your friend,

123
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,660
not my daughter-in-law.

124
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,860
I'm feeling unwell, I need some rest.

125
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,860
You go down first.

126
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,220
Back then, I...

127
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,420
Back then...

128
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,300
What were you talking about?

129
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,060
I'm telling Mr. Fu
how you used to bully me.

130
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,260
I bullied you? I've never done that.

131
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,820
Don't listen to her, Grandpa.

132
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,500
Mr. Fu, I have evidence.

133
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,020
You do?

134
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,500
I keep them on my phone.

135
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,420
Let me see.

136
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,380
Both of you...

137
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:24,980
Wait.

138
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,220
You have already teamed up against me?

139
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,860
Stop it.

140
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,740
Fu Yunshen.

141
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,220
Mr. Fu, look at him.

142
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,420
Give it to me.

143
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,740
Give it to me.

144
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,140
- It's fine to let me have a look.
- Mr. Fu!

145
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,340
Goodness.

146
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,180
When did I bully you?

147
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,380
You're bullying her now.

148
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,940
- Give it to me.
- It's been a while.

149
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,900
Dr. Zhu.

150
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,260
I could hear you laugh from upstairs.

151
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,900
This is not some alleys you stay in.

152
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,740
Let's go and check on the dishes.

153
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,340
All right.

154
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,580
Oh, right.

155
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,500
This is her first visit to our home.

156
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,540
Have a nice talk.

157
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,380
Mrs. Fu.

158
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,260
Mrs. Fu.

159
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,420
This is a gift for you.

160
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,540
Dr. Zhu, you've lost some weight.

161
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,220
And your complexion doesn't look good.

162
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,060
Your job must be tiring.

163
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,980
I'm not sure if you'll like the gift.

164
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,580
Come on in, let's eat.

165
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,180
Taste this.

166
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,940
Miss Tao made this fish.

167
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,420
It's great.

168
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,060
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

169
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,380
Oh, this one.

170
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,860
Try this.

171
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,460
This tastes even more delicious.

172
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,740
Pork rib.

173
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,820
Eat more.

174
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,580
Which one should I take?

175
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,820
I can serve myself.

176
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,740
Really?

177
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,620
This one.

178
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,220
Yunshen.

179
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,220
We're sitting here.

180
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,020
What are you doing?

181
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,380
Mom.

182
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,260
This is Zhu Jiu's first visit here.

183
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,180
I'm worried she can't reach the food.

184
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,820
You...

185
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,540
It's a family dinner.

186
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,780
There are no rules here.

187
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,460
Zhu Jiu.

188
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,900
Help yourself to do whatever you like.

189
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,180
All right.

190
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,820
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

191
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,140
Good. Let's eat.

192
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,020
Dr. Zhu, you're in the Department
of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

193
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,740
You know Zhizhi, right?

194
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,140
She's in the Department of Anesthesia.

195
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,700
We worked on the same surgery before.

196
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,180
We've known the Zhou family for years.

197
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,060
Yunshen and Zhizhi

198
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,100
have been friends since infancy.

199
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,660
Mom.

200
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,820
Why did you bring her up?

201
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,580
Why couldn't I?

202
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,340
Zhizhi's mom has hinted at me
for several times,

203
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,620
but I didn't give her the green light.

204
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
I told her

205
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,420
that though we're compatible
in terms of family status

206
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,140
and both of them are tight,

207
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,020
I don't like Zhizhi's job.

208
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,180
She always has to stay up late.

209
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,660
She can't manage to take care of you.

210
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,140
Dr. Zhu.

211
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,140
I can tell you and Yunshen are close,

212
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,220
you'll resign from work
after getting married, right?

213
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,140
Mrs. Fu.

214
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,580
I hold my family dearly too.

215
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,020
I think I can try

216
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,140
to take care of my career
and family at the same time.

217
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,260
Much easier said than done.

218
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,420
Mom.

219
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,620
Regarding the marriage life,

220
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,020
there are so many surgeons out there,

221
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,740
but I have never heard
someone resign from work

222
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,540
after getting married.

223
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,460
Shuning.

224
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,620
It's her first time here, though.

225
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,460
You're bringing this up too soon.

226
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,900
Here, have some fruit.

227
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,180
Dad.

228
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,220
You're aware of
Yunshen's health problem.

229
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,980
His body has been weak

230
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,340
after the accident.

231
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Afterward, his responsibilities
in Lingtian will become heavier.

232
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,820
His future wife

233
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,940
must prioritize taking care of him.

234
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,980
Otherwise,

235
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,860
I'll be worried for him.

236
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,660
Mom.

237
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,060
In a marriage,

238
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,900
we have to take care of each other.

239
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,660
No one should sacrifice their job
for the other.

240
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,860
If a man

241
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,540
doesn't take care of his wife

242
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,380
and expects the other way round,

243
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,460
why doesn't he just hire a housemaid?

244
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,140
Good idea.

245
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,940
Go and hire a housemaid.

246
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,620
It seems the dinner

247
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,220
has become a debate now.

248
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,180
Eat up.

249
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,580
I wasn't thoughtful enough.

250
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,180
I didn't expect my mom
to have that attitude.

251
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,300
I'm sorry.

252
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,500
It's fine.

253
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,020
No need to apologize to me.

254
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,220
I know you're torn between.

255
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,780
Zhu Jiu.

256
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,260
Please give me some more time.

257
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,780
I'll definitely convince my mother.

258
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,260
Anyway, we have more time ahead.

259
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,700
Please send me home.

260
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,700
Granny is waiting for me.

261
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,940
Your hands feel cold.

262
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,100
It's nippy out here.

263
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,140
I see.

264
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,740
Let me warm them up.

265
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,020
No, thanks.

266
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,980
It's better for you...

267
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,500
Bumped you.

268
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,220
What are you doing?

269
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,420
Bump me back.

270
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,820
That's how we play this.

271
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,940
Miss Tao.

272
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,100
You can have this.

273
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
This is too precious.

274
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,380
I can't take this.

275
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,220
Just take it when I ask you to take it.

276
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,700
Dad.

277
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,220
Have a seat.

278
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,420
Never mind.

279
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,980
Shuning.

280
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,580
You shouldn't have done that

281
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,100
this evening.

282
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
Anyway,

283
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,540
she's someone your son likes.

284
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,180
I want her to take the hint

285
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,420
and withdraw.

286
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,740
But have you considered

287
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,420
Yunshen's feelings?

288
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,780
There's something

289
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,340
you can't cross over the line.

290
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,020
Don't do anything

291
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,100
that will make you regret it.

292
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
Why did you coop yourself in the room

293
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,140
once you came back?

294
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,020
I'm reading.

295
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,940
It wasn't going well.

296
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,100
You were having a hard time there,
right?

297
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,660
No.

298
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,140
Sit, Granny.

299
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,300
I'd been a daughter-in-law before.

300
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,420
When my mother-in-law
gave me a hard time,

301
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,780
I was thinking

302
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,180
how I'd trouble my daughter-in-law

303
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,500
in the future.

304
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,660
Granny.

305
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,740
Did you give Mom a hard time?

306
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,660
I did have that thought.

307
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,740
But your dad

308
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,980
held her so dearly.

309
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,420
So, I didn't do anything to her.

310
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,340
Besides,

311
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,140
your mom was sensible

312
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,060
and pretty.

313
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,220
She was calling me so sweet

314
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,460
that it could mellow me out.

315
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,620
How could I ever trouble her?

316
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:02,980
Really?

317
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,740
But I feel

318
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,740
that you're not easy to deal with.

319
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,140
Me?

320
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,860
The one who is difficult to deal with
is your mother.

321
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,580
She had a bickering with your dad.

322
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,340
She then packed her luggage
and left for Country M.

323
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,740
By the time your dad found her,

324
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,220
she was building fire for the locals

325
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,260
and had ashes all over her face.

326
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,540
Seriously?

327
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,300
As doctors,

328
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,260
they devoted their everything.

329
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,100
But as parents,

330
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,060
they left you with me

331
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,020
and you had to suffer with me.

332
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,820
Don't say that.

333
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,780
I didn't suffer at all.

334
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,740
Granny.

335
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,060
I'm so blessed

336
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,340
to be staying with you.

337
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,500
If your parents were still alive,

338
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,580
his family wouldn't be up
to our station.

339
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,220
It's not about that.

340
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,460
Why not?

341
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,140
Families like Yunshen's

342
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,900
are very snobbish.

343
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,220
But since you've made up your mind,

344
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,060
you need to be prepared
to face the trouble.

345
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,740
But it's not a big deal.

346
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,220
You don't live off anyone.

347
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,460
You bring bread to your own table.

348
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,260
Rest assured, Granny.

349
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,660
No need to worry about me.

350
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,500
I know what I have to face.

351
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,340
I don't worry about you.

352
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,940
But it's quite a loss

353
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,460
for giving out my Reishi Mushrooms

354
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,180
when the receivers
don't appreciate them.

355
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,940
I wish

356
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,700
I could've grounded them into powder

357
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,140
and drunk it with you.

358
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,300
Like granny, like granddaughter.

359
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,300
Mom.

360
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,500
Let's have a talk.

361
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,260
If you want to talk about Zhu Jiu,

362
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,100
cut that out.

363
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,420
Before this, you wanted me
to learn more about her.

364
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,100
Fine.

365
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,260
I've already met her twice.

366
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,500
I can tell you now,

367
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,700
I disapprove of your relationship.

368
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,640
You might as well admit
that you're concerned about

369
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,300
her family background

370
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,940
because she can't help in my career.

371
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:28,980
That's right.

372
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,260
It's good that you know.

373
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,700
Your grandfather

374
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,380
has given the Vice President position

375
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,340
to Fu Xizhou.

376
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,220
Plus, he receives help
from Gu Changrong.

377
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,540
You have no chips to compete with him.

378
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,780
He'll soon take over our home.

379
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,460
Mom.

380
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,460
I promise you

381
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,700
that I'll regain control of the company.

382
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,580
But not on the condition
of sacrificing my relationship.

383
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,940
Yunshen.

384
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,220
It's fine that you don't like Zhizhi.

385
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,860
Mr. Qi's daughter is returning
from overseas soon.

386
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,300
Let's set up a meeting with her, okay?

387
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,620
Mom.

388
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,500
Stop it, please.

389
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,860
I'm not meeting any women.

390
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,820
Zhu Jiu means a lot to me.

391
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,940
And I'll propose to her.

392
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,100
Are you going against me purposely?

393
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,700
I have made this decision

394
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,340
when the moment I stood up
from the wheelchair.

395
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
No means no.

396
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,300
I'm not here to get your approval.

397
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,100
I came to inform you about my decision.

398
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,900
I'm your mother.

399
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,580
You must respect my opinion.

400
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,380
Mom.

401
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,140
Since back then,

402
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,860
I have always respected your opinion.

403
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,980
However,

404
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,100
you never make good

405
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,660
on your promise.

406
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,260
I don't.

407
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,700
I'm doing this for your own good.

408
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
Love isn't the only thing needed
in a marriage.

409
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,900
I have no idea

410
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,420
if love alone is enough

411
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,180
to support a long marriage,

412
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,020
but a marriage without love

413
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,180
will never be a happy one.

414
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,620
Just like you and Dad.

415
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,580
It's fine if Zhu Jiu and I can't stick
to the end.

416
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,700
That's my own choice, anyway.

417
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,940
I hope you can respect my choice.

418
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,140
This Ethiopian coffee tastes unique.

419
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Even its aroma is pleasant.

420
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:13,860
Here.

421
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,540
Have a taste.

422
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,140
Here you go.

423
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,140
Leo has chosen a great present.

424
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,060
Where are you going?

425
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,260
Boss.

426
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,100
Are you slacking off
when I'm not around?

427
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,700
No.

428
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,780
Oh, right.

429
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,780
Leo sent us the Ethiopian coffee.

430
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,820
It tastes so good.

431
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,300
Here.

432
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,060
Have a taste.

433
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,700
Is it for you?

434
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,060
No.

435
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,340
It's for you.

436
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:40,740
Forget it.

437
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,340
I'm not calling names

438
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,220
since I'm in a good mood.

439
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,700
Coming next,

440
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,660
we're going to have an important task.

441
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,780
I was just informed

442
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,300
that the board members approved

443
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,900
our lymphoma vaccine project.

444
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,900
Here's a suggestion.

445
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,380
Let's dine out

446
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,420
to celebrate this, all right?

447
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,060
That's right!

448
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,860
I have plans tonight.

449
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,540
But your dinner is all on me.

450
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,100
- Great!
- Boss is so generous.

451
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,740
Boss.

452
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,580
You can bring Dr. Zhu to join us.

453
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,540
Are you sure?

454
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,780
I don't think it's good to show off

455
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,580
how happy we are.

456
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,500
True, though.

457
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,180
If so, we won't disturb you.

458
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,300
As an apology for your absence,

459
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:21,940
Boss asks us

460
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,300
to order food

461
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,620
however we want.

462
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,900
Thank you, Boss.

463
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:27,740
Okay.

464
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,660
Eat to your heart's content.

465
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,180
It's all on me.

466
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,260
But Chen Le will pay for himself.

467
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,260
Wait, Boss.

468
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,780
Off you go.

469
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,460
Stop making noise here.

470
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,180
Get back to work.

471
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,180

As we promised,

Sure.

It's been a long while.

523
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,580
Yes, Mr. Fu.

524
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,100
Dr. Ji.

525
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,900
Do you mind

526
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,260
to have me for dinner with you?

527
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,980
Not at all.

528
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,260
I won't hold back, then.

529
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,060

530
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,620

533
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,780
This is your favorite, right?

534
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,340
Here you go.

535
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,820
Sure, thank you.

536
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,300

537
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,180
Have a piece of foie gras.

538
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,420
You've worked so hard
during the operation.

539
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,580
By the way, Dr. Ji.

540
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,980
Zhu Jiu doesn't eat offals.

541
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,660
Give it to me.

542
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,500
Here.

543
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,540
The foie gras tastes good.

544
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,620
Try this.

545
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,020
Okay.

546
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,860
Zhu Jiu, eat this too.

547
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,260
All right.

548
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,460
Dr. Ji, you might not know her well.

549
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,020
Zhu Jiu

550
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,180
doesn't eat offals,

551
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,100
seafood

552
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,100
and animal feet.

553
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,380
She's a picky eater, no?

554
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,020
Really?

555
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,380
But I remember

556
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,780
we ate it before.

557
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,500
I was working with you on an operation
for five hours last time.

558
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,620
I was so starved

559
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,580
that I could eat everything.

560
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,180
You sound like
you're complaining about me.

561
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,580
I wouldn't dare to do so.

562
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,780
Do you know

563
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,220
many people are envious of me

564
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,780
for having a good mentor like you?

565
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,100
Dr. Ji.

566
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,020
Please look out for me.

567
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,140
Well,

568
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,460
I'm an impartial person.

569
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,220
It depends on your performance later.

570
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,340
Cheers, chief.

571
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,780
The wine tastes quite well, right?

572
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,140
Excuse me, here's your dish.

573
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,260
All right.

574
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,380
Thank you.

575
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,980
I'd like to have another serving
of the dessert to go.

576
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,220
Sure.

577
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,020
The food here tastes pretty good, right?

578
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:31,980
It's delicious.

579
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,180
I'll bring you here again next time.

580
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:33,980
Okay.

581
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,180
I've packed a dessert for Granny.

582
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,180
Let's bring it to her later.

583
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,980
Oh, my.

584
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,900
No wonder
Granny has been complimenting you.

585
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,020
I need to use the restroom.

586
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,020
You like Zhu Jiu?

587
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,900
Yes, I do.

588
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,820
Then you have no chance.

589
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,180
Zhu Jiu told me

590
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,060
that she would never
date someone in her field.

591
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,620
Because two doctors being together
will be too busy

592
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,780
and no one can take care of the family.

593
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,020
I bet you made this up.

594
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,700
You'd better get that idea
out of your mind.

595
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,260
I really care about Mint as a friend.

596
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,340
So, I won't disturb her.

597
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,660
Unless

598
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,980
you break her heart.

599
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,660
You don't stand a chance.

600
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,140
We're getting married soon.

601
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,540
Dr. Ji,

602
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,100
you're the closest senior to Zhu Jiu.

603
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,340
We'll cordially invite you

604
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,020
to our wedding for sure.

605
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,820
Please grace us
with your presence, Dr. Ji.

606
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,620
Certainly.

607
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,660
What took you so long?

608
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,700
Cheers.

609
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,260
You didn't eat any, though.

610
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,580
I keep this for you.

611
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,340
[Lingtian]

612
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,220
- See you.
- This is adorable.

613
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,500
I don't want balloons, thanks.

614
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,580
I don't have cash with me.

615
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,300
Don't touch me.

616
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,580
Do you know this is a hospital?

617
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,780
If you come any nearer,

618
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,100
I'll call the security.

619
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,100
I won't sign up for any membership plan.

620
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,300
I don't want a membership
for the gym, beauty care, or whatever.

621
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,700
Let me go, please.

622
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,700
Don't follow me.

623
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,820
Do you hear me?

624
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,660
Zhu Jiu.

625
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,020
I'd like to...

626
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,420
Stay put.

627
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,500
We can't get the balloons back
if they fly away.

628
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,100
So many of them.

629
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,260
They are worth many bowls of wonton.

630
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,660
Don't waste your money again.

631
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,660
Look, a man in love.

632
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,820
What a great smile you have.

633
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,820
You must be thinking of Dr. Zhu.

634
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,420
Do you envy me?

635
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,900
Chen Le, I have a question.

636
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,980
For an independent and strong woman,

637
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,180
what kind of proposal does she like?

638
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Are you talking about Dr. Zhu?

639
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,060
Are you going to propose to Dr. Zhu?

640
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,700
Yes, I am.

641
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,700
Goodness! That's wonderful.

642
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,860
But will she accept your proposal?

643
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,380
What if she turns you down?

644
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,340
Give me good blessings, will you?

645
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,140
Of course,

646
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,700
I'll give you my blessing.

647
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,180
But speaking of proposals,

648
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,460
you need to use the right way.

649
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,260
Am I right?

650
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,420
You're stating the obvious.

651
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,860
You see,

652
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,780
what's the reality of marriage?

653
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,780
The couple must understand

654
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,180
and support each other.

655
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,260
A marriage proposal

656
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,900
is the key to marriage.

657
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,940
You have to let her know
that you care about her the most

658
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,260
and you know her the best.

659
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,540
Do you know Dr. Zhu well?

660
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,340
Do you know what her favorite food is?

661
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,820
What's her favorite outfit?

662
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,020
What's the thing she loves?

663
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,580
Do you know

664
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,740
what her favorite is?

665
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,380
Her favorite?

666
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,620
Her favorite should be me.

667
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,620
This is a no-brainer.

668
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,340
Money, of course.

669
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,460
Here's the plan.

670
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,300
Lay your bank card and savings record

671
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,340
in front of her.

672
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,220
And tell her this.

673
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,820
"Quit your job.

674
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,140
I'll take care of you."

675
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,220
Chen Le.

676
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,380
That's vulgar.

677
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,860
Dr. Zhu is a devoted doctor.

678
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,100
Don't you know?

679
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,660
True.

680
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,700
Maybe a simple one.

681
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,580
How about this?

682
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,580
You set up a hospital

683
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,900
and make her the president.

684
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,580
What do you think?

685
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,500
After you get off work,

686
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,180
prepare fifty marriage proposal plans.

687
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,260
If none of them is feasible,

688
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,980
you can prepare

689
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,300
to hand in your notice.

690
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,500
All right.

691
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,100
Either you or I
must be sick in the head.

692
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,820
Why would I ask you?

693
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,860
I'll ask Granny.

694
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:45,860
Yunshen.

695
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,860
Hello, Granny.

696
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,500
Are you busy now?

697
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,780
Well,

698
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,780
I have something to ask you.

699
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,100
[Chapel]

700
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,340
What do you think of this place?

701
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:16,900
Pretty good.

702
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
Don't tell me you have to work
on Friday.

703
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,740
There'll be a spring session trade fair.

704
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,540
It's scheduled two months before.

705
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,300
It can't be changed.

706
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,940
But this event was fixed two years ago.

707
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,780
The fair will end before ten.

708
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,740
Could you finish your sentence
in one go?

709
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,020
You scared me.

710
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,660
I'll come home to fetch you after that.

711
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,340
No.

712
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,260
Let's meet here.

713
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,780
When you come in here,

714
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,460
you'll see me in my gown,

715
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,540
sitting in sparkling sunlight.

716
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,380
All right.

717
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,020
Three days.

718
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,260
Three days later, I'm going to marry

719
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,820
the man I love the most.

720
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,900
Haven't you already married me?

721
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,860
That won't do.

722
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,620
We mustn't skip the ceremony.

723
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,420
It'll become a precious memory for us.

724
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,820
I've been looking forward
to this day for two years.

725
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,060
Finally, it's coming.

726
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,540
Zhizhi.

727
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,580
Your wedding gift.

728
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,700
Another present?

729
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,820
You gave me one before.

730
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,980
My double blessings.

731
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,180
Thanks.

732
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,140
So beautiful.

733
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,100
Do I look pretty with them?

734
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,140
You're drop-dead gorgeous.

735
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,020
Ruanruan.

736
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,220
Are you really not going to
have a wedding?

737
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,580
You mentioned that
you wanted a lawn wedding

738
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,980
with a symphony orchestra.

739
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,620
One's mind changes over time.

740
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,140
Xizhou doesn't like

741
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,780
a noisy wedding.

742
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,180
I don't like it either.

743
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,580
It's a waste of effort and money.

744
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,460
A waste of effort and money?

745
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,340
This sounds like something
Fu Xizhou would say.

746
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,540
I think

747
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,500
he has influenced your liking now.

748
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,860
Marriage is about two persons.

749
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,380
So, I must consider what he likes.

750
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,660
Ruanruan.

751
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,900
You always put his preference
before yours.

752
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,980
I really hope

753
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,060
that you can consider yourself more.

754
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,540
I have my own reasons.

755
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,580
You know my dad very well.

756
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,980
He's obsessed
with superficial reputations.

757
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,460
If we were to have a wedding,

758
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,540
he would request everything best
for the wedding.

759
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,260
That's too extravagant.

760
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,460
Besides, I've been working

761
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,060
on the art exhibition about kids
in Country M.

762
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,500
I want to save the money to help them.

763
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,140
Xizhou is supportive of me too.

764
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,860
This is a great idea.

765
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,220
But I feel sorry for you.

766
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,420
After all, this is only once
in a lifetime.

767
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,060
Zhizhi.

768
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,300
I can't ask for everything I want.

769
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,060
You've become more skilled

770
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,460
since I saw you several months ago.

771
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,460
Because I'm under
my good mentor's charge.

772
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,780
Dr. Ji, Dr. Zhu.

773
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,940
To celebrate the successful surgery,

774
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,140
let's go for a barbecue

775
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,020
and have some drinks tonight.

776
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:26,900
Okay.

777
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,500
Do you have time, Zhu Jiu?

778
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,500
I'm down.

779
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,340
Are you done?

780
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,300
Yes.

781
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,500
I have a call.

782
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,380
Hello, Granny.

783
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,620
I was about to call you.

784
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,340
Darling.

785
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,420
Are you getting off work?

786
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,380
Yes.

787
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,340
I have a gathering
with my old classmates outside.

788
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,700
But I got a call from the community

789
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,740
that the power company
will come for service.

790
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,100
Come back home after you finish work.

791
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,500
Okay.

792
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,740
I'm coming back now.

793
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,900
You must take a cab back

794
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,220
at nighttime.

795
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,540
Don't take the bus, okay?

796
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,740
All right, I know.

797
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,500
Okay.

798
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,180
I'm sorry, Dr. Ji.

799
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:15,900
It's fine.

800
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,700
Let's hang out next time.

801
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,700
You must enjoy the barbecue later.

802
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,460
I got to go now.

803
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,260
Okay, go ahead.

804
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,860
There are so many delicious food.

805
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,820
Granny.

806
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,900
Why did you prepare all this?

807
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,220
Granny?

808
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,420
Are we having a birthday party?

809
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,540
Fu Yunshen.

810
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,420
You're fast.

811
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,100
Dr. Zhu, you're smart indeed.

812
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,140
What's with all the preparation?

813
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,460
What day is today?

814
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,980
Your birthday?

815
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,460
Ticked off?

816
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,900
I was kidding.

817
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,340
You have got some nerve, huh?

818
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,900
You actually sent Granny away.

819
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,940
I wouldn't dare.

820
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,060
You've wronged me.

821
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,700
Granny cares about me,

822
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,580
so she put on this show with me

823
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,540
and gave us some time alone.

824
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,900
What a lavish spread we have today.

825
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,900
Is there anything you want to ask of me?

826
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,060
Close your eyes.

827
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,700
I have something very important

828
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,620
to tell you.

829
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,220
Close your eyes.

830
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:22,900
Okay.

831
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,500
You're not proposing to me, are you?

832
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,420
An excellent man like me
is going to propose to you,

833
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,340
aren't you happy?

834
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,020
It was a joke. I was teasing you.

835
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,340
I bought you a watch.

836
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,700
But I think

837
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,420
this is not a good time.

838
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,180
Let's dig in.

839
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,980
The dishes are getting cold.

840
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,780
Let's eat first.

841
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,260
Yunshen.

842
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,140
I'm sorry.

843
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,380
Why do you say sorry?

844
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,020
Do you know
why I prepared a candlelight dinner?

845
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,980
If you don't say yes,

846
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,820
I'd blow out the candles.

847
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,020
Are you scared?

848
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,420
I'm not scared of the dark anymore.

849
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,500
You've healed my trauma
back in Country M.

850
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,420
Yunshen.

851
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,660
I really love you.

852
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
But marriage isn't just about
the two of us,

853
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,380
it involves two families.

854
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,340
You know that too.

855
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,380
Your mother doesn't like me.

856
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,380
You should give me and your mom
some time

857
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,100
to accept each other,

858
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:41,980
all right?

859
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,260
If they don't accept you

860
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,500
in five years

861
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,020
or ten years,

862
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,540
what will you do?

863
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,140
Will you break up with me?

864
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,460
No.

865
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,060
As long as you need me,

866
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,420
