379
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,860
Okay.

380
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,900
But please think about

381
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,100
what I told you just now.

382
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,140
Okay.

383
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,940
Goodnight, Mom.

384
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,020
Goodnight.

385
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,660
(Boss,)

386
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,980
so we are just going to shove the paper

387
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,740
into their hands?

388
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,300
They pass by here every day.

389
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,780
Waiting here is our first step
to success.

390
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,860
Boss.

391
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,540
You are adorable.

392
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,500
I wonder how Dr. Zhu puts up with you.

393
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,460
I am not powerful right now,

394
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,100
but it doesn't mean I can't fire you.

395
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,460
Boss,

396
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,500
you can't say that.

397
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,500
Either way,

398
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,100
shoving the paper into their hands

399
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,740
doesn't mean they will read it, right?

400
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,540
We have to do it.

401
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,460
It's the reason why I hired you.

402
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,100
Okay.

403
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,940
Mr. Liu!

404
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,940
I've been meaning to see you.

405
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,940
I listened to the feedback from you

406
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,700
and your colleagues

407
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,100
and adjusted the proposal accordingly.

408
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,500
We also adjusted the development budget

409
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,540
and bank loan application

410
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,980
based on the company's

411
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,980
financial situation.

412
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,700
Please have a look.

413
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,500
Uncle Liu,

414
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,700
I was waiting for you for this meeting.

415
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,340
But you went to play golf.

416
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,820
It couldn't be helped.

417
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,260
Xizhou wanted me there.

418
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,660
Mr. Liu.

419
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,820
You can't leave without reading it.

420
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,060
Stop it now.

421
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,660
I have a meeting now.

422
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,940
Uncle Liu,

423
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,820
what meeting?

424
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,260
Why am I unaware of it?

425
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,300
I thought you hated routine meetings.

426
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,260
After all, you're the heir.

427
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,660
You are special.

428
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,820
Mr. Liu,

429
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,500
please read it.

430
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,020
[Gu Ruanruan]

431
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,180
[Lingtian Pharmaceutical Group]

432
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,620
Xizhou,

433
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,220
you're engaged to Ruanruan.

434
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,620
Why did no one tell me about that?

435
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,620
I haven't been able to go home lately.

436
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,740
Now that you're here,

437
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,780
I can officially tell you

438
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,380
that I'm getting married.

439
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,980
But you don't love Ruanruan.

440
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,540
You can't...

441
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,100
I'm old enough to build a family.

442
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,820
Getting married is nothing
to make a big fuss about.

443
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,620
Xizhou.

444
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,540
What are you after?

445
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,020
I finally found the right one.

446
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,660
Shouldn't you be happy for me?

447
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,020
Mr. Fu,

448
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,020
Chairman Fu asked for you.

449
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,900
It's time to be an adult now.

450
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,460
No more fooling around.

451
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,460
Grandpa is getting old.

452
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,620
Think about him.

453
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,380
But Xizhou...

454
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,860
Ms. Jiang,

455
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,740
were you looking for me?

456
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,660
Update, please.

457
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,660
Everyone in the R&D Department

458
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,420
is very motivated.

459
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,060
Stop.

460
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,780
I want to know

461
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,420
what you did in Country M.

462
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,500
Who did you see?

463
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,660
Country M?

464
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,260
There were a lot of sick kids,

465
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,340
village chiefs,

466
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,500
and arms dealers.

467
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,020
It is a beautiful place

468
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,740
but the stability leaves much

469
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,660
to be desired.

470
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,180
I want to know about the doctor.

471
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,540
Dr. Zhu?

472
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,740
Her name is Zhu Jiu.

473
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,620
Z-H-U.

474
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,740
J-I-U.

475
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,980
Dr. Zhu

476
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,820
is beautiful.

477
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,340
Her jaw is pronounced.

478
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,380
She has big eyes,

479
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,220
a good nose,

480
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,340
cute lips,

481
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,500
and a very nice figure.

482
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,780
Most importantly,

483
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,140
she's very hardworking.

484
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,460
She's definitely a girlfriend material.

485
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,180
Is this how you report things?

486
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,740
I put you in the R&D Department

487
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,260
so that you can report to me

488
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,660
whatever Yunshen is doing.

489
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,980
You, however,

490
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,580
switched sides right away.

491
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,180
Can you be useful?

492
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,580
I did

493
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,180
get into R&D on my own...

494
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,980
Keep me updated.

495
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,140
Yes, ma'am.

496
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,500
I will take my leave now, Ms. Jiang.

497
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,260
Go first. I have to use the toilet.

498
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,140
Sure. I'll come to you later.

499
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,460
Bye.

500
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:36,660
No.

501
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,580
No, no.

502
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,860
I'm sorry.

503
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,020
Sorry. Sorry.

504
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,340
Mint.

505
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,900
Dr. Ji.

506
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,780
What a coincidence. You're here too.

507
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,740
I...

508
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,260
Don't worry.

509
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,260
I'm cool.

510
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,820
I respect it.

511
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,460
Good luck.

512
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,300
My friend is waiting for me.

513
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,220
See you.

514
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,020
Wait.

515
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,220
Hi.

516
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,860
Sorry.

517
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,780
Madam Jiang.

518
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,820
I'm holding the engagement party
at my place.

519
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,340
I didn't have time to send you

520
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,740
an invitation

521
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,060
and Grandpa thought that
it was inadequate.

522
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,340
So,

523
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,060
here you go.

524
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,060
After all,

525
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,700
we are a family, right?

526
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,580
Congratulations.

527
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,740
Thank you.

528
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:19,980
By the way.

529
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,140
How forgetful I am.

530
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,500
This bottle

531
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,580
is from Mr. Xie.

532
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,660
You might need it more than I do.

533
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,180
Mom.

534
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,860
What did you do today?

535
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,500
I was working.

536
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,100
What are you working on?

537
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,540
Are you aware that Fu Xizhou

538
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,420
thinks you're a joke?

539
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,140
Mom, can we discuss this tomorrow?

540
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,780
I have a lot of things to do here.

541
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,660
Yunshen.

542
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,860
You'd give up the harvesting rights now?

543
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,740
Perdo harvesting rights

544
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,220
are what give you power in the company.

545
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,940
At the moment,

546
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,820
we can't depose Xizhou
unless we work with the Zhous.

547
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,980
Oh, my dear mother. Don't worry.

548
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,020
I prefer to stay in the lab.

549
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,020
I'm not interested
in the company at all.

550
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,660
Yunshen.

551
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,540
Quit being self-centered.

552
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,220
You must think about me.

553
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,380
Do you know what my family and I

554
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,100
did for Lingtian?

555
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:53,860
Mom.

556
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,100
Rest assured.

557
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,260
I'm sure
when Xizhou becomes the chairman,

558
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,580
he won't kick you out.

559
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,740
You don't know him at all.

560
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,540
Open your eyes.

561
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,180
He removed my allies one by one.

562
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,620
Mom.

563
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,660
I don't like Zhizhi.

564
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,820
I don't want to hurt her.

565
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,860
Moreover,

566
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,780
you don't need love to thrive.

567
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,620
But I do.

568
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,540
You know very well how miserable it is

569
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,980
to have a loveless marriage.

570
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,460
Do you want me to end up like you?

571
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,140
Sorry, Mom.

572
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,300
I don't mean to say that.

573
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,380
(Mom,)

574
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,060
he's my half-brother.

575
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,460
He can take over the company

576
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,180
if he wants.

577
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,260
(I really have no interest
in the company.)

578
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,900
Xizhou is part of the Fu family.

579
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,860
He has the right to inherit the company.

580
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,540
Once he has the company,

581
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,620
do you think

582
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,580
you can stay in that lab of yours?

583
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,460
Mom.

584
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,740
Xizhou isn't that kind of person.

585
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,180
I can pass the company to Yunshen.

586
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,820
But will he take it?

587
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,220
Of course.

588
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,340
Hold on.

589
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,620
Let's get one thing clear.

590
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,500
Are you sure he will take it,
but not you?

591
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,940
I'm holding the engagement party
at my place.

592
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,580
I didn't have time to send you

593
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,900
an invitation

594
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,260
and Grandpa thought that
it was inadequate.

595
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,500
So,

596
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,260
here you go.

597
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,100
After all,

598
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,340
we are a family, right?

599
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,260
Congratulations.

600
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:16,860
Oh, right.

601
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,820
This bottle

602
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,940
is from Mr. Xie.

603
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,260
You might need it more than I do.

604
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,100
(I don't like Zhizhi.)

605
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,340
I don't want to hurt her.

606
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,380
Look.

607
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,220
You don't need love to thrive.

608
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,180
But I do.

609
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,020
You know very well how miserable it is

610
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,540
to have a loveless marriage.

611
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,060
Do you want me to end up like you?

612
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,060
(Yunshen is still a kid.)

613
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,260
(He needs a father.)

614
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,900
(Stay, please.)

615
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,820
(You begged me to give you a child.)

616
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,660
(You said that you needed one.)

617
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,540
(Don't you love me?)

618
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,500
(Why would I love someone)

619
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,940
(who uses any means
to serve her own interest?)

620
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,780
Despite the improved environment,

621
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,100
your condition remains the same.

622
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,620
I'm here to send you the invitation.

623
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,540
You recognize the handwriting,
don't you?

624
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,500
[You are invited, Madam Jiang Shuning.
Groom: Fu Xizhou]

625
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,100
Xizhou is getting married?

626
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,860
Will Fu Rong be there?

627
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,940
Does Fu Rong like Xizhou?

628
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,700
You didn't know?

629
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,940
Fu Rong is already dead.

630
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,740
You will not have

631
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,740
what I cannot have.

632
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,700
Fu...

633
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,540
Fu Rong is dead?

634
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,820
Yes.

635
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,780
Very dead.

636
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,940
Fu Lingtian used his personal jet

637
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,660
to bring his cold,
lifeless son back home.

638
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,860
When he was cremated,

639
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,740
I couldn't even squeeze out
a single tear.

640
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,980
He's already dead. Why the hassle?

641
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,860
Who cares where he died

642
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,260
and where his body was laid.

643
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,220
Don't you think so?

644
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,820
You...

645
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,300
You...

646
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,180
You killed him.

647
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,740
Yes.

648
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,380
You killed him.

649
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,340
Yes.

650
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,340
You killed him.

651
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,540
Murderer!

652
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,740
Murderer!

653
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,300
You killed him!

654
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,060
What's wrong with you?

655
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,460
Your son

656
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,980
didn't even tell you
that he's getting married.

657
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,460
Even your biological son despises you.

658
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,380
We're both mothers.

659
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,580
You will be there

660
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,980
for your son's big day, won't you?

661
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,500
I bought this gown for you.

662
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,300
Get yourself together.

663
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,100
I can't wait to see you there.

664
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,020
Murderer!

665
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,380
- Murderer!
- Nurse!

666
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,060
Murderer!

667
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,780
Murderer!

668
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,460
- Murderer!
- It's okay.

669
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,540
- Murderer!
- It's okay.

670
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,780
- She's gone now.
- She's a murderer.

671
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,380
It's okay, she's gone now.

672
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,620
Murderer!

673
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,860
Call the police!

674
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,700
She's gone.

675
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,380
Gone.

676
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,700
- Call the police.
- Calm down.

677
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,100
You'll be fine.

678
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:55,980
Excuse me.

679
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,140
Zhizhi.

680
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,100
Mind the steps.

681
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,260
Mr. Niu.

682
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,180
- Hi.
- It's been a while.

683
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:07,980
Indeed, it has.

684
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,660
Don't let me keep you.

685
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,580
Okay.

686
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,980
Mr. Du, Mr. Wang.

687
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,940
- Sorry for the poor reception.
- It's okay. Go, go.

688
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,620
Sorry.

689
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,580
Don't worry.

690
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,540
Mr. Liu.

691
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,140
Long time no see.

692
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,780
Good work today.

693
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,660
It'll be a long day.

694
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,540
- The pleasure is mine.
- Chen Le.

695
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,700
Come here.

696
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,340
So?

697
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,620
Is everything ready?

698
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,940
Almost.

699
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,500
Thank you.

700
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,460
My dear.

701
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,540
Why are you out here?

702
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,780
Where's Xizhou?

703
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,500
He needs to get changed now.

704
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,500
Be patient.

705
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,540
He'll be here soon.

706
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,340
Xizhou.

707
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,620
I've been looking for you.

708
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,220
When did you get changed?

709
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,420
I need to talk to Yunshen.

710
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,500
I'll come to you later.

711
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,300
Don't take too long.

712
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,220
Hurry up.

713
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:11,900
Xizhou.

714
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,380
Think about what I said.

715
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,700
I already told you many times

716
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,220
that I have no power.

717
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,340
If you voice your support for me,

718
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,620
the board of directors will reconsider.

719
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,540
Those sly foxes

720
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,220
won't listen to me.

721
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,180
They only care about profits.

722
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,420
And you are in their way.

723
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:31,780
Xizhou.

724
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,620
Professor Hans

725
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,580
is looking into ways

726
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,460
to cultivate it.

727
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,540
All I want is a small extension

728
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,740
for the project's date.

729
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,140
You know very well

730
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,700
how long this extension will be.

731
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,260
A decade?

732
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,660
Two decades?

733
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,020
You always give me the same answer.

734
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,380
Are you one of them now?

735
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,500
Do you have no regard

736
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,900
for human life at all?

737
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,580
My dear brother.

738
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,020
Listen.

739
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,100
Before you do charity,
you need to first be rich.

740
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:19,780
Xizhou.

741
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,820
I really need your help now.

742
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,940
I can give up on everything.

743
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,500
I won't fight with you over Lingtian.

744
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,380
Yunshen.

745
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,380
You don't even have any leverage

746
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,820
against me.
