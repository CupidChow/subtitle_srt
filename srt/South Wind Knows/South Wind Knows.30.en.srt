00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,700
It hurts me

189
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,620
to see you like this.

190
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,580
Don't worry.

191
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,260
I'm getting well fast.

192
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,420
That's good.

193
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,220
Oh, right.

194
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,900
I came here to tell you something.

195
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,220
What's it?

196
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,380
I remembered.

197
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,780
It's something very important.

198
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,580
Your mom is suspended.

199
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,140
So...

200
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,060
You need to get well soon.

201
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,540
I'm waiting for you
to come back and fight me again.

202
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,100
Otherwise, there will be

203
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,180
no place for you in Lingtian.

204
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,060
Fu Xizhou,

205
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,900
I underestimated you.

206
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,540
You're a lot more cold-blooded
than I thought you were.

207
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,980
What fruit would you like?

208
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,700
You loved bananas
when you were a kid, didn't you?

209
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,620
Let me peel it for you.

210
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,460
Here you go.

211
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,660
You won't eat it?

212
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,660
I will then.

213
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,740
Look at you.

214
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,780
You're so hot-blooded

215
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,060
that you'd risk your life

216
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,740
for someone you love.

217
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,820
How brave.

218
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,700
But while you're being brave,

219
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,940
can't you also care about your own mom?

220
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,020
If she does anything else,

221
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,580
your Dr. Zhu

222
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,500
will feel bad too.

223
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,180
Are you done?

224
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,860
Get more rest.

225
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,570
[Beloved Son]

226
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,340
Hello?

227
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,820
Yunshen,

228
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,940
why are you still up?

229
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,580
Mom,

230
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,060
why didn't you tell me
about the suspension?

231
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,620
Chen Le is such a big mouth.

232
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,460
I didn't let him tell you.

233
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,860
You're still in the hospital.

234
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,820
How can I make you worry?

235
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,500
Mom,

236
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,580
I'll discuss it with Grandpa

237
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,900
about this.

238
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
It's useless.

239
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,540
If your grandpa was really worried
about your feelings,

240
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,700
he wouldn't have pushed me this far.

241
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,300
Yunshen,

242
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,660
if you really want to help me,

243
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,260
get well

244
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,460
and get back to work
as soon as possible.

245
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,660
Okay, I got it.

246
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,300
It's nice out here.

247
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,700
Is Yunshen very busy?

248
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,500
I haven't seen him in a while.

249
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,820
He's on a business trip.

250
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,780
Business trip?

251
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,860
When will he be back?

252
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,540
Soon, I guess.

253
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,900
I'll ask him to come and see you
when he gets back.

254
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,820
When I saw him,

255
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,860
I thought he was a little too naggy.

256
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
But I haven't seen him in a while,

257
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,140
and I feel empty.

258
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,660
I miss him.

259
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,260
Okay.

260
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,460
When he's back,

261
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,340
I'll ask him to come and see you.

262
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,460
He'll also make you some nice food.

263
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,660
No.

264
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,100
Don't tire him out.

265
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,460
Granny.

266
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,300
The weather is so good.

267
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,900
It's a beautiful day.

268
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,900
I should put out my books

269
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,660
as well as my dried fruits
and vegetables.

270
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,860
Why don't you

271
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,780
go home

272
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,180
and give all the dried fruits
as well as vegetables

273
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,940
to the neighbors?

274
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,220
Okay.

275
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,220
I'll do it.

276
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,740
They'll be very happy.

277
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,500
Darling.

278
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,220
It's almost Chinese New Year.

279
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,340
I want...

280
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,020
I want to go home for Chinese New Year.

281
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,420
Don't worry.

282
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,160
I've been feeling better
the last couple of days.

283
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,380
I've got a good appetite.

284
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,580
You haven't been home
for Chinese New Year for so many years.

285
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,220
Since you're finally back this year,

286
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,380
I want us to spend it together.

287
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,820
Okay.

288
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,700
I'll ask Chief Sun for leave.

289
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,700
If he says yes,

290
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,180
we'll spend Chinese New Year together
this year.

291
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,220
Are you cold?

292
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,500
Here, have some water.

293
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,300
Drink slowly.

294
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,060
It's a bit hot.

295
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,140
Mrs. Fu,

296
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,380
you wanted to see me?

297
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,620
Dr. Zhu,

298
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,100
I know

299
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,460
it's hard

300
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,420
to leave a man

301
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,900
as outstanding as Yunshen.

302
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,620
I'm not an unreasonable person.

303
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,980
How about this?

304
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,820
You leave Yunshen

305
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,540
and I'll find a liver donor
for your grandma.

306
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,300
So she can have the surgery at once.

307
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,780
Let's make a fair deal.

308
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,780
How's it?

309
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,060
Boss,

310
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,100
how are you doing?

311
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,420
Are you feeling better?

312
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,900
What are you doing?

313
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,780
This is for you.

314
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,820
Take it back.

315
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,100
Fine,

316
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,900
take this bouquet

317
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,220
to Dr. Zhu's department

318
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,900
when you leave.

319
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,380
What's wrong?

320
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,780
Did you see Ji Silang

321
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,620
pestering Zhu Jiu again?

322
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,100
Why hasn't he let go?

323
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,340
He won't give up, will he?

324
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,260
Boss,

325
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,060
that's not what I saw.

326
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,300
I saw...

327
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,580
Well...

328
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,020
What happened?

329
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,100
You can't keep a secret.

330
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,180
It's written all over your face.

331
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,860
What's on my face?

332
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,980
You'd better tell me now.

333
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,240
I saw Dr. Zhu and Ms. Jiang

334
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,620
at the entrance of the hospital.

335
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,820
My mom's giving her a hard time again?

336
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,620
Well, yes

337
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,660
and no.

338
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:56,980
Mrs. Fu,

339
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,020
I'll think of my own way
to find a liver donor for my grandma.

340
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,540
I don't need your help.

341
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,940
I'll get going now.

342
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,140
Stop there.

343
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,660
Don't always act like

344
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,740
you're independent and self-reliant

345
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,700
to enchant Yunshen.

346
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,340
Dr. Zhu,

347
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,580
you really have a poor memory.

348
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,460
You almost drowned in Heidelberg then.

349
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,140
Do you want to try it again?

350
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,780
Mrs. Fu,

351
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,100
I know you're behind

352
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,260
Meng's lawsuit.

353
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,380
I didn't tell Yunshen

354
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,700
because he cares so much about you.

355
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,660
I won't appreciate it.

356
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,580
Don't try anything.

357
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,620
I'll never accept you in my life.

358
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,260
Mrs. Fu,

359
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,940
I won't force you to like me anymore.

360
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,780
But I hope you'll think of Yunshen.

361
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,420
He has no interest in
inheriting the company,

362
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,820
but he's worked hard for you
over and over again.

363
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,300
He knows you don't like me

364
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,380
but still tries to maintain
a balance between you and me.

365
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,580
He has done for you
so many things that he doesn't like.

366
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,100
Have you ever thought of him

367
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,700
or communicated with him?

368
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,740
If you love him,

369
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,020
I hope you won't push him anymore.

370
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,500
That's only going to get him
farther and farther away.

371
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,380
If it weren't for you,

372
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,300
I wouldn't have had any problems
with Yunshen!

373
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,740
Mrs. Fu,

374
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,700
I've got a lot of work to do.

375
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,060
I'll get going now.

376
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,140
Mr. Fu, what are you doing?

377
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,780
You can't leave the hospital.

378
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,900
You really can't leave the hospital.

379
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,380
Your condition is very severe now.

380
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,180
What's going on?

381
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
Mr. Fu insists on leaving the hospital.

382
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,740
Why don't you try to talk him out of it?

383
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,900
Leave it to me.

384
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,900
You may go out now.

385
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,100
Yunshen,

386
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,580
where are you going at this late hour?

387
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,860
Home.

388
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,300
Must you go home right now?

389
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,500
I got it.

390
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,980
I'll send you home.

391
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,580
It's not a good idea for you
to be leaving the hospital

392
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,860
in your current condition.

393
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,220
You're being reckless.

394
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,140
Walk slowly.

395
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,540
Take it easy.

396
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,820
I'm fine.

397
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,100
I'll open the door.

398
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,700
(Granny asked about you today.)

399
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,980
(She wants to eat your dumplings.)

400
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,100
(Be good and get well soon.)

401
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,540
(Don't stay up too late
talking about work, you hear me?)

402
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,140
Okay,

403
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,340
I got it.

404
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,060
Let's go.

405
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,860
Zhizhi called me

406
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,580
and told me that you're in a hurry
to see me.

407
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,300
You're in such a bad shape.

408
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,500
Why don't you stay in the hospital?

409
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,100
Can't we talk about it tomorrow?

410
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,380
Mom.

411
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,180
What do you really want?

412
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,260
She complained to you so soon?

413
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,260
I just thought Meng's family was pitiful

414
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,260
and helped the weak defend their rights.

415
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,260
I didn't do anything outrageous.

416
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,340
But her?

417
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,020
She just defended herself
with a few words.

418
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,420
Who knows if she made a mistake?

419
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,220
She's fine now, isn't she?

420
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,460
Why does she want
to ruin our relationship?

421
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,940
Zhu Jiu didn't do anything.

422
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,340
Mom,

423
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,260
I don't understand.

424
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,020
Why do you dislike her so much?

425
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,580
I don't dislike her.

426
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,460
I hate her.

427
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,500
I hate her for making you get hurt
every time.

428
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,740
You had a car accident.

429
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,180
You were in a coma.

430
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,980
You could barely stand up.

431
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,500
Do you know

432
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,540
how hard it's been for me

433
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,260
over and over again?

434
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,620
I can't suffer the pain for you.

435
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,220
Yunshen.

436
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,220
You're a piece of my flesh.

437
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,660
If you hurt once,

438
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,340
I hurt a million times more, you know?

439
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,060
Look at what happened this time.

440
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,940
You almost lost your life.

441
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,860
But why did you

442
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,940
try to ruin Zhu Jiu's life?

443
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,300
Why did you use her grandma's life
as a bargaining chip?

444
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,980
Because...

445
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,420
I love you.

446
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,860
I can't watch

447
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,380
someone who's always hurting you
stay with you.

448
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,580
Love me?

449
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
You've never

450
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,940
cared about what I really want.

451
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,260
You don't like Zhu Jiu,

452
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,500
so you're going to ruin her.

453
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,420
Mom.

454
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,340
You're truly horrible.

455
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,780
Love

456
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,420
is nothing

457
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,300
but a selfish cover for you.

458
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,660
Anyone can call me selfish,

459
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,900
except you!

460
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,860
Did you know

461
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,820
how much I've given you over the years?

462
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,220
How much I've lost for you?

463
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,780
How could you say that to me?

464
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,740
If you keep this up,

465
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,060
you'll lose me too.

466
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,820
Are you threatening me?

467
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,500
Mom.

468
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,260
Stop hurting Zhu Jiu.

469
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,100
This is my last line.

470
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,340
For that woman,

471
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,740
you don't even want your mom?

472
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,500
Your dad...

473
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,540
He turned me into a laughing stock

474
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,300
because of his mistress.

475
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,700
Your grandpa

476
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,300
even brought that illegitimate son
back for me to raise,

477
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,140
breaking my heart every day.

478
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,220
Over the past 20 years,
I have worked so hard without complaint.

479
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,420
Even if I didn't get credit for it,

480
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,180
I had done my share of hard work.

481
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,740
But just because of one mistake,

482
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,260
I was kicked out.

483
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,460
None of this

484
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,140
is a reason for you to hurt people.

485
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,420
No matter how miserable
or desperate I was,

486
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,500
as long as I thought of you,

487
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,460
I could endure anything.

488
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,340
But now that you don't need me,

489
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,980
what's the point of living?

490
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,420
Mom,

491
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,220
will you stop it?

492
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,380
You forced me to do it.

493
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,140
Mom!

494
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,540
Mom,

495
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,660
can you listen to me?

496
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,580
Let go of your obsession.

497
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,460
You've devoted your whole life

498
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,900
to this company.

499
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,700
Is it worth it?

500
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,460
Let go?

501
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,620
I've staked my whole life.

502
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,220
I've given everything

503
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,700
and now you're telling me to let go?

504
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,220
Even if it's a path to death,

505
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,060
I'll go all the way down it.

506
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,260
Okay.

507
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,700
Then tell me.

508
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,900
What do I have to do for you
to be satisfied?

509
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,460
Not unless

510
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,580
you break up with her.

511
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,580
Mom,

512
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,580
why do you force me so much?

513
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,220
Why do you always force me?

514
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,220
What did I do wrong?

515
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,860
You forced me first!

516
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,260
Yunshen!

517
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,020
Yunshen!

518
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,940
Zhizhi!

519
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,420
Zhizhi!

520
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,020
Yunshen.

521
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,100
Yunshen!

522
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,500
Madam Jiang.

523
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,860
- Yunshen!
- Madam Jiang, calm down.

524
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,700
Yunshen!

525
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,820
My child!

526
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,580
Madam Jiang.

527
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,220
(He mustn't have any health problems.)

528
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,860
(Even common colds)

529
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,140
(must be handled carefully.)

530
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,500
Madam Jiang.

531
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,460

(Dr. Zhu,)

549
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,260
let's have lunch together
after my rounds.

550
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,860
Okay.

551
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,420
Alright, I'll get going now.

552
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,360
Dr. Zhu! Dr. Zhu!

553
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,100
My husband has been detained.

554
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,580
I have lost my daughter.

555
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,940
I can't lose my husband.

556
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,220
He was deceived too.

557
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,420
Being deceived is no excuse
for hurting someone.

558
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,260
Dr. Zhu.

559
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,580
Dr. Zhu.

560
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,140
What are you doing?

561
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,380
I know you're a kind person.

562
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,620
You're soft-hearted.

563
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,660
I beg you.

564
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,340
Please don't sue us.

565
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,700
You and Mr. Fu are both powerful.

566
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,380
Please let us go, okay?

567
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,500
Please do it for Meng's sake,

568
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,260
okay?

569
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,340
Okay?

570
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,180
He's still in a hospital bed.

571
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,100
You're not being fair, no?

572
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,140
Besides, this is a criminal case,

573
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,300
not something we can interfere with.

574
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,380
No, Dr. Zhu.

575
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,260
Listen to me.

576
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,660
We know we're wrong.

577
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,980
Please let us go.

578
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,500
Don't sue us, okay?

579
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,260
I beg you.

580
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,980
I know I was wrong.

581
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,940
You've got someone to protect,

582
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,060
and so do I.

583
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,660
Dr. Zhu, listen to me.

584
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,660
Mrs. Meng, stop it.

585
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,900
Dr. Zhu, listen to me.

586
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,700
- Stop it.
- I...

587
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,400
If you keep doing this,

588
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,220
I'll ask the security guards to come
and get you.

589
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,580
Dr. Ji,

590
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,300
please beg Dr. Zhu for me.

591
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,300
You need to understand

592
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,340
that your husband has committed
a criminal offense.

593
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,180
Besides,

594
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,900
Mr. Fu paid for Meng's surgery.

595
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,140
He set up a heart fund

596
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,660
to help kids like Meng

597
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,210
because he didn't want you to feel bad.

598
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,220
How long are you going to do
moral coercion on him?

599
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,660
No, that's not the case.

600
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,980
We didn't mean that.

601
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,380
- Please let us go.
- Stop looking.

602
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,300
Don't sue us.

603
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:10,860
This is a hospital.

604
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,620
- I beg you.
- Please go out.

605
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,140
Dr. Zhu,

606
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:12,900
Dr. Ji,

607
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,900
I beg you.

608
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,540
We were wrong. Please let us go!

609
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,380
Alright, dismiss.

610
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,260
Go and mind your own business.

611
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,380
Thank you.

612
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,100
Looks like Mr. Fu didn't tell you

613
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,180
about Meng's surgery fee.

614
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,100
That's just the way he is.

615
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,580
He's usually a high-profile guy,

616
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,660
but he's actually...

617
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,820
How is he now?

618
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,140
I talked to his attending physician.

619
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,740
He's recovering well.

620
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,460
That's good.

621
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,860
What about his family?

622
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,380
They still won't let you see him?

623
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,940
His phone has been turned off

624
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,620
and I can't reach him.

625
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,340
Multiple surgeries

626
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,700
have aggravated

627
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,060
Mr. Fu's acute heart condition.

628
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,420
This means his family has to
take great care of him.

629
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,940
Even a small cold

630
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,060
could be life-threatening to him.

631
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,820
Okay.

632
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,140
Let me in.

633
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,340
Dr. Zhu, you can't go in.

634
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,500
Yunshen.

635
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,940
Fu Yunshen!

636
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,180
Yunshen!

637
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,980
Yunshen!

638
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,620
Yunshen!

639
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,820
I'm Zhu Jiu.

640
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,060
Yunshen!

641
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,580
What are you yelling for?

642
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,700
This is a ward.

643
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,420
Mrs. Fu,

644
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,420
let me in.

645
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,820
I really want to see him.

646
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,820
(Multiple surgeries)

647
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,020
(have aggravated)

648
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,580
(Mr. Fu's acute heart condition.)

649
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,780
(This means his family has to
take great care of him.)

650
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,300
(Even a small cold)

651
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,460
(could be life-threatening to him.)

652
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,460
He's getting better

653
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,700
and needs more rest.

654
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,220
Dr. Zhu,

655
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,460
please leave.

656
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:03,900
Dr. Zhu,

657
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,100
don't make this difficult for me.

658
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,140
Please leave.

659
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,140
Yunshen,

660
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,020
let's go lie down inside.

661
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,260
It's too cold in here.

662
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,100
Okay?

663
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,300
Alright.

664
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,020
I'll sit here with you for a while.

665
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:11,940
Mom.

666
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,380
I'll break up with Zhu Jiu.

667
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,620
Well, the doctor said you should rest,

668
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,620
so I chased...

669
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,780
I know my own physical condition
very well.

670
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,300
I don't know how long I have left
to live,

671
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,020
so I can't hold others back.

672
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,420
Did the doctor tell you about it?

673
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,980
I asked him myself.

674
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,020
Yunshen.

675
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,700
Don't imagine things.

676
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,380
You'll be fine

677
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,540
as long as you get rest.

678
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,540
Once you're discharged
from the hospital,

679
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,140
I'll take you to a warm place

680
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,300
to stay

681
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,860
and recuperate.

682
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,380
I'm well aware of my condition.

683
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,540
