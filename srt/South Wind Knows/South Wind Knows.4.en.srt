[Episode 4]

21
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,780
How silly.

22
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,740
I think you were quite silly just now.

23
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,220
Chen Le,

24
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,660
do you think
you can still go back to Shanghai?

25
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,260
I...

26
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,380
I'm here to send you fruits.

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,500
I've already washed them.

28
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,700
It's for anti-aging, anti-glycation,

Boss,

32
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,900
a call for you.

33
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,700
Fu Yunshen, are you alright?

34
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,460
Gu Ruanruan,

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,780
how smart of you.

36
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,300
Only my mother and brother
know about this satellite phone.

37
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,460
How do you get to know this?

38
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,460
To get a phone number is not that hard.

39
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,780
Zhizhi went to the hospital

40
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,980
to see Sir Fu two days ago.

41
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
She was very worried to know

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,980
you went to Country M.

43
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,380
She wanted to call you but held back,

44
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,740
she called but couldn't get through.

45
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,580
I asked Xizhou

46
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,780
for your number

47
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,580
but he wouldn't give me.

48
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,780
So I looked for Madam Jiang,

49
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,660
telling her
that Zhizhi wanted your number,

50
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,380
but Zhizhi had been looking at the number
for days,

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,220
she was afraid to make a call.

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,540
So I called for her,

53
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,060
as we've something important
to talk about.

54
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,580
You see,

55
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,260
it's very easy.

56
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,460
It's not cumbersome at all.

57
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,700
Fu Yunshen,

58
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,540
are you listening?

59
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,580
I'm all ears.

60
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,540
Zhizhi is asking,

61
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,340
are you coming back for
Sir Fu's birthday?

62
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,060
I'm not able to make it.

63
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,820
I want the latest information on Xizhou.

64
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,900
Gu Ruanruan,

65
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,180
I don't get it.

66
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,540
Why you were able to locate me

67
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,620
at all costs,

68
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,260
but you can never find my brother?

69
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,740
Because he is avoiding me.

70
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,940
It won't be easy to find someone

71
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,060
who deliberately avoids you.

72
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,740
Sorry,

73
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,780
I'll hang up now.

74
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,940
Bye.

75
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,220
Were you just on the phone
with your girlfriend?

76
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,140
Are you alright?

77
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,180
I'm almost over it.

78
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,740
I've heard from Chen Le.

79
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,580
Thanks for staying over by my side.

80
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,420
Not at all.

81
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,980
It'd be your turn to care for me
when I'm sick.

82
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,460
Sure.

83
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,380
Is it very sour?

84
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,580
Not really.

85
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,620
I think I am going to bed.

86
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,580
Don't stay up too late.

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,660

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,140
Good night.

94
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,340
Is there something wrong with my brain?

95
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,500
Why would I explain this to her?

96
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,220
What's wrong with you?

97
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,780
Why are you not keeping walking?

98
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,140
I'm tired.

99
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,340
I want to take a break.

100
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,540
I'm tired too.

101
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,660
Thank you.

102
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,340
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,700
that seems to be our tent.

109
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,660

110
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,220
Help! Help!

111
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,700
Doctor!

112
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,460
What's the matter?

113
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,420
What happened?

114
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:54,940
He's hurt.

115
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,700
Where is the OR?

116
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,380
There, let's go.

117
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,180
I'll guide you all.

Gunshot wound.

119
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,860
Hemorrhagic shock.

120
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,820
Swift surgery is needed.

121
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,500
Where's the doctor?

122
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,900
There are no other doctors.

123
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,900
Dr. Ji is out on a call.

124
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,820
No other doctors?

125
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,140
Right, what should we do?

126
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,580
Are you a doctor?

127
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,100
Yes.

128
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,140
Be my assistant.

129
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,980
Get oxygen and IV drip ready.

130
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,020
This place is already overloaded.

131
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,740
How is the sanitary condition?

132
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,180
There's no other way.

133
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,860
The wounded were sent here every day.

134
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,540
Our mobile clinic
is already overcrowded.

135
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,740
Not sure what happened.

136
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,900
The bullets seemed to be intentionally

137
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,460
pierced through the thigh and arm.

138
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,980
It was shot at close range.

139
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,660
They went back again.

140
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,980
What do you mean?

141
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,620
Some of the refugees here

142
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,220
sneak back

143
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,300
because they are homesick.

144
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,700
Once the militants

145
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,260
discovered them,

146
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,620
they would shoot.

147
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,540
Somewhat as a warning to others.

148
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,180
Why would they do this to the village?

149
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,220
A diamond mine was discovered there.

150
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,620
All forces are eyeing,

151
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,780
but none have taken action yet.

152
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,100
They are containing each other.

153
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,860
If a war breaks out one day,

154
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,020
a refugee camp

155
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,380
would not be able to solve the problem.

156
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,980
I haven't told you.

157
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,860
My surname is Ji,

162
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,940
This name sounds familiar.

163
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,740
Is your English name Lucien?

164
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,500
How do you know?

165
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,500
Hello, Senior.

166
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,260
I'm Zhu Jiu,

167
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,460
your junior in the same major.

168
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,660
I've heard that
there is a Chinese prodigy

169
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,500
who gave up his high pay
to become a volunteer.

170
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,980
I didn't expect to meet you here.

171
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,620
Oh, you're my junior.

172
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,460
Nice to meet you.

173
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm pleased.

174
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,700
Nice to meet you.

175
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,220
Fu Yunshen.

176
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,780
Hello, Mr. Fu.

177
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,220
Dr. Zhu,

178
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,140
Dr. Ji is very busy for sure,

179
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,860
don't cause any more trouble here.

180
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,980
Did I cause any trouble?

181
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,260
Carry your stuff. Let's leave.

182
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,820
Not leaving?

183
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,900
It'd be great if you don't.

184
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,220
Then you can stay

185
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,620
and catch up with Dr. Ji.

186
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,940
You don't need to sleep,

187
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,220
since you have great stamina.

188
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,820
Zhu Jiu,

189
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,860
what are your plans after graduation?

190
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,700
Nothing planned.

191
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,940
My uncle called me,

192
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,140
and I'm here to help.

193
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,500
I'll do a ward round.

194
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,180
Let's go.

195
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,780
Sure.

196
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,380
Supplies here are still short, right?

197
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,060
Yes.

198
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,900
The situation here is more complicated.

199
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,020
Scabies is a disease

200
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,780
that itches badly.

201
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,140
True.

202
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,540
Adults can tolerate it

203
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,780
but elderly and children
with weakened immune system

204
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,740
will have a hard time.

205
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,020
A small refugee camp has too many people.

206
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,540
It is common for dozens of people

207
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,700
to crowd in a tent.

208
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,340
It's simply a paradise

209
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,420
for contagious skin diseases.

210
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,620
We don't have much medicine left.

211
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,660
Can't you apply for more?

212
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,540
I've applied,

213
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,700
but haven't heard back yet.

214
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,060
This place is shortage of supplies.

215
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,420
It's hard to get a batch of drug

216
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,980
in such an urgent need.

217
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,260
I saw that the tents were donated
by Lingtian Pharmaceutical Group.

218
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
So are the drugs?

219
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,980
There are many aids
in terms of medical supplies,

220
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,660
but Lingtian
is a long-term donor to Hope.

221
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,120
[Hope]

222
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,940
Good morning, Boss.

223
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,620
Have some water.

224
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,540
I'll make you a good meal this morning.

225
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,580
Cook you some noodles.

226
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,260
Have you finished eating?

227
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,420
I have not eaten.

228
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,340
I keep the last pack for you.

229
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,020
Then give it to Dr. Zhu.

230
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,980
Dr. Zhu left early in the morning.

231
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,620
Did she go to the clinic again?

232
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,820
Yes.

233
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,380
Maybe she's overjoyed to meet an alumni.

234
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,620
Give these chocolate bars

235
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,020
to the children.

236
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,460
All of them?

237
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,900
Yes, all of them.

238
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,140
Alright.

239
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,260
Go.

240
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,980
Hello, Yunshen.

241
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,460
Grandpa is asking,
how's the situation there?

242
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,420
Xizhou,

243
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,500
everything goes smoothly here.

244
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,220
Is Grandpa mad?

245
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,180
Yes!

246
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,860
Are you hoping to burn me up
to my grave?

247
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,900
Grandpa,

248
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,900
how could it be?

249
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,020
My grandpa is in good health,

250
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,180
live to be a hundred years old,

251
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,340
with a strong and healthy body!

252
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,660
Such a glib tongue.

253
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,140
Let me tell you,

254
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,260
do your job well,

255
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,980
everyone is waiting for your good news.

256
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,340
If you come back empty-handed,

257
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,180
it would be a slap in my face.

258
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,540
Don't worry, Grandpa.

259
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,660
I'll try my best

260
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,700
and will not let you down.

261
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,100
That's just about right.

262
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,140
Alright,

263
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,380
be careful.

264
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,180
I got it, don't worry, Grandpa.

265
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,580
I'll go back as soon as possible.

266
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,900
Bye.

267
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,220
Okay.

268
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,020
Here.

269
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,380
Don't drop that, okay?

270
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,220
I got one here. Come on.

271
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,940
Hey, Dr. Zhu, Dr. Ji.

272
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,100
Le.

273
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:04,740
Take it.

274
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,260
Not bad,

275
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,940
even the treasure has been taken out.

276
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,980
That's right,

277
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,260
these are Boss's treasures.

278
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,740
Let's go, it's time to eat.

279
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,980
You all go ahead,
I will eat with Dr. Ji.

280
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,020
Why?

281
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,740
You're such a big eater.

282
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,420
If the clinic goes broke
due to your habits,

283
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,180
it would be bad.

284
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,620
Right, Dr. Ji?

285
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,300
Fu Yunshen.

286
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,220
Dr. Ji, come quickly.

287
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,740
There's a critical patient.

288
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,180
You all go ahead.

289
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,060
Alright.

290
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,460
You guys just eat,

291
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,140
don't mind me.

292
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,820
Zhu Jiu,

293
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,580
we've to leave tomorrow,
no later than that.

294
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,140
I got it.

295
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,580
I will inform Dr. Ji later.

296
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,660
Where to eat?

297
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,740
There.

298
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,340
Thank you.

299
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,660
How is it?

300
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,140
All checked.

301
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,420
Alright,

302
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
go get some rest.

303
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,860
Thank you.

304
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,860
Dr. Ji.

305
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,460
Mint,

306
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,380
I'd like to discuss something with you.

307
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,700
What's wrong?

308
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,420
I've examined and it's malaria.

309
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,980
Now malaria can be cured,

310
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,140
but there is a lack
of medical treatment here.

311
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,140
Not enough drugs?

312
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,380
It's enough for now,

313
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm afraid the epidemic
will continue to spread.

314
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,180
Then you definitely won't be able
to work alone.

315
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,300
You all are leaving?

316
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,180
Yes, we are leaving tomorrow.

317
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,060
Mint,

318
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,020
can you stay for a few more days?

319
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,340
I'm sorry.

320
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,860
I went too far.

321
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,940
Dr. Ji,

322
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,900
how many days
until your new colleagues arrive?

323
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,060
Around one week.

324
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,140
Let me think about it.

325
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,180
Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!

326
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,780
My sister, please.

327
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,180
Gunshot wound to arms

328
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,300
and scratches to the face.

329
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,020
Treat the gunshot wound first,

330
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,540
and prepare for the surgery.

331
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,220
Okay, let's go.

332
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,740
Done with work?

333
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,060
Have you eaten?

334
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,780
Not yet. I'll go to eat later.

335
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,660
Have some hot tea.

336
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,060
Thank you.

337
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,300
Don't stay up too late today,

338
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,740
we will leave at eight tomorrow.

339
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,180
Fu Yunshen.

340
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,500
I'd like to talk to you.

341
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,100
Let's stay for one more week.

342
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,340
Why is that?

343
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,340
Our schedule is already

344
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,340
very tight.

345
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,140
I understand that,

346
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,500
but scabies is spreading here

347
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,220
and someone has been infected
with malaria.

348
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,260
Medical resources
are also in short supply.

349
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,020
The only doctor is Dr. Ji,

350
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,300
so he is a bit overwhelmed.

351
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,060
So there won't be a shortage of supplies
if you stay?

352
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,140
But I can help.

353
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,060
Zhu Jiu,

354
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,380
I know

355
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,020
you mean well to help,

356
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,820
but we have other work to complete,

357
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,100
and we can't afford to hold up any time.

358
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,900
It won't be too long.

359
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,060
Dr. Ji told me

360
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,700
his new colleagues will arrive soon,

361
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,700
and he has already asked for my help.

362
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,420
It's too late,

363
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,140
we have to leave tomorrow.

364
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,500
Let's stay a little longer.

365
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,140
The clinic was also short-handed
before you came.

366
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,980
It worked before,
why doesn't it work now?

367
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,820
The number of refugees in the camp
has increased,

368
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,980
Dr. Ji could not handle it.

369
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,980
The monsoon season is coming soon,

370
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,140
so we have to leave tomorrow.

371
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,940
And you haven't completed your tasks.

372
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,260
How can you help others?

373
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,140
Zhu Jiu,

374
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,620
as a reminder,

375
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,820
you are here for research,

376
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,260
not to be a volunteer.

377
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,660
You have to prioritize your task.

378
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,820
There are so many patients here,

379
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,700
you can't change anything or help them

380
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,020
by staying for two more days.

381
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,180
But if I stay two days longer,

382
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,700
I can treat a few more patients.

383
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,780
Today I saved

384
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,980
a little girl who was wounded.

385
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,900
But you alone

386
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,780
can't change the situation here.

387
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,580
I can't walk away after seeing it.

388
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,260
If you all want to leave, then go ahead.

389
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,100
Don't mind me.

390
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,020
Are you being reasonable?

391
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,340
Are you not doing the report anymore?

392
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,700
None of your business.

393
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,900
I don't even bother.

394
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,060
The fever has gone down.

395
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,540
Take their temperature every morning,

396
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,380
see if it's normal.

397
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,580
Okay, sure. Go ahead.

398
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,020
Dr. Ji, all well at your end?

399
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,500
It's fine here,
things are pretty stable.

400
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,340
How about you?

401
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,980
No more fever for the three of them.

402
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,340
Things are quite well.

403
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:18,620
Okay.

404
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,420
Take some rest.

405
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,820
It's fine.

406
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,860
I have this.

407
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,220
Dr. Zhu,

408
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,260
come!

409
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,380
Dr. Ji, I'll go ahead then.

410
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:15,900
Sure.

411
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,180
I'm sorry

412
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,980
to change the schedule last minute.

413
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,340
Got you.

414
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,140
But,

415
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,340
it has been delayed for several days,

416
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,820
so we are a little short on time.

417
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,260
We have to hurry up from now on.

418
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:54,700
Alright.

419
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,340
Boss,

420
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,500
Mr. Fu calls us every day

421
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,460
to urge us on our progress.

422
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
Is it really okay for us

423
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,900
to delay for so long?

424
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,740
Can't leave one to sink or swim, right?

425
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,340
Yes, we can't.

426
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,140
But you've just gone into a fight
with Dr. Zhu,

427
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,620
now you're drawing back
so many supplies for her,

428
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,500
doesn't it make us look bad?

429
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,140
Chen Le,

430
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,700
do you think I'm so petty?

431
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,580
Never have I ever.

432
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,100
But the problem is that
this time in Country M,

433
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,540
you didn't pay us either.

434
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,140
Dr. Ji.

435
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,380
Come.

436
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,500
Great.

437
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:06,940
Thank you.

438
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,820
I don't drink.

439
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,540
Great!

440
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,620
I haven't seen an apple in days.

441
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,220
What's wrong?

442
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,140
Someone told me this

443
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,060
before.

444
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,820
Girlfriend?

445
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,380
Where's your boyfriend
and his assistant?

446
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,500
I haven't seen them in a while.

447
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:49,980
He is not my boyfriend.

448
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,020
They have already left.

449
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,540
Mint,

450
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:54,780
sorry to have taken

451
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,740
so much of your time.

452
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,340
My colleagues are in the capital.

453
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,740
They will be here soon.

454
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,340
Dr. Ji,

455
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,780
don't mention it,

456
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,340
I stayed here voluntarily.

457
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,780
I've washed it.

458
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,300
I won't eat it now.

459
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,900
I will wait for her to wake up
before eating.

460
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,020
Keep it for her.

461
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,980
She will wake up for sure.

462
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,140
Dr. Ji,

463
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,580
there are a lot of supplies.

464
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,460
So go and help out.

465
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,700
Right.

466
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,140
Dr. Ji, right there.

467
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,700
Alright.

468
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,060
Didn't you leave?

469
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,900
We left.

470
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,100
Weren't we going through
all the troubles for supplies?

471
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,340
Right, Boss?

472
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,260
Dr. Zhu, let me help you.

473
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,780
It's okay
if someone doesn't say thank you.

474
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,380
They don't even know how to talk now.

475
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,180
I know how to talk.

476
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,540
You haven't paid the money you owe me.

477
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,420
Why are you so obsessed with money?

478
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,860
How did you draw so many supplies
at once?

479
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,580
It's not difficult.

480
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,820
There are too few drugs
in the nearby towns.

481
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,740
I asked the company to contact them.

482
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,500
Some supplies will be delivered later,

483
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,940
and they will contact Dr. Ji.

484
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,500
It's great!

485
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,300
Why am I so kind?

486
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,420
Mr. Fu,

487
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,460
thank you so much for your supplies.

488
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,860
Mint, Nessa is awake.

489
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,740
Let's go take a look.

490
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,300
Sure.

491
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,220
Sounds great.

492
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,740
She has been taken away again?

493
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,500
Why did you bring this fan over here?

494
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,180
No.

495
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,180
This was used to repel insects

496
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,820
while I was taking care of Nessa today.

497
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,300
I brought it back by accident.

498
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,020
You are especially nice to this girl.

499
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,300
Do you remember that
when we first came here,

500
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,900
we saw a little girl

501
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,420
on a swing,

502
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,220
with long hair,

503
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,460
big eyes?

504
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,100
And I gave her a candy.

505
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,860
Oh, it's her.

506
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,620
The one whom you scared her off?

507
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,780
Can you be more serious?

508
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,180
She was not scared off.

509
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
She was shy.

510
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,180
Why am I being not serious?

511
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,420
The little girl was hurt so badly.

512
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,020
Did something happen?

513
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,260
When Nessa left home,

514
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,420
she lost her puppy.

515
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,060
She went back to look for it,

516
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,980
but she met the garrison

517
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,540
and wounded her.

518
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,100
I didn't expect that

519
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,060
they would pull a knife
on a little girl.

520
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,460
When she was sent in,
she was covered in blood.

521
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,340
I was scared out of my mind.

522
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,660
Well,

523
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,980
you are not totally out of your mind.

524
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,620
You still know how to save someone.

525
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,300
You have done a good job.

526
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,700
But there is a long wound

527
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,300
on her face.

528
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,860
I heard from Dr. Ji

529
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,980
that you are very good at stitches.

530
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,460
The top in your school says
you are so awesome,

531
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,740
proving that you are excellent.

532
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,540
There's no big deal.

533
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,220
There will still be a scar.

534
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,580
Look,

535
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,860
I'm flaunting a tail for you,
as a reward.

536
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,260
Zhu Jiu,

537
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,220
you did great.

538
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,700
What you do is very meaningful.

539
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,820
I believe you

540
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,180
can do it.

541
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,780
Return it to her.

542
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,700
Good night.

543
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,920
[Hope]

544
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,380
Mint,

545
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,700
I'm sorry

546
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,020
that just for helping me,

547
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,580
it took so much of your time.

548
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,260
Dr. Ji,

549
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,500
don't mention it.

550
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,660
It really doesn't matter.

551
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,620
My colleagues will be here soon.

552
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,220
Thanks to Mr. Fu's help,

553
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,420
malaria in the refugee camp

554
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,940
has been well controlled.

555
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,660
I think you all should depart quickly.

556
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,460
Throw it over.

557
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,020
What on earth?

558
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,540
I will give you one
as a gift each later.

559
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,420
For you.

560
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,460
Okay.

561
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,020
It's much better.

562
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,900
It's really working.

563
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,900
Of course.

564
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,540
Boss said that

565
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,020
for the scars to disappear completely,

566
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,340
it will take some time.

567
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,180
Just wait patiently.

568
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,140
Right,

569
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,780
as for these herbs,

570
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,740
Boss has drawn them himself,

571
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,500
so they should be easier to find.

572
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,980
He left the tools for you too.

573
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,180
Dr. Zhu,

574
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,860
I'm going back to pack up.

575
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,980
You hurry up too.

576
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,460
Got it.

577
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,460
Dr. Ji.

578
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,420
I'm leaving,

579
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,180
bye.

580
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,100
It's quite well drawn.

581
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,380
I'll see you again.

582
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,580
I'll see you again.

583
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,500
The Ninggu Village is right in front.

584
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,740
It's the largest local meeting spot
of ancient ethnic groups.

585
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,340
There are many customs and taboos
in the village,

586
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,620
you all must beware.

587
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:26,900
Boss,

588
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,020
we've arrived at the village.

589
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,340
Finally, there's something to eat.

590
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,220
- First,
- Come, have some water.

591
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,580
No matter what strange patterns

592
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,940
you see on their faces,

593
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,100
don't stare at them.

594
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,860
They think that being stared at
will bring disaster.

595
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,300
Second,

596
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,100
don't take photos of animals
and people in the village.

597
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,420
Besides,

598
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,460
when dining with the Chief and Dawala,

599
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,580
the food they pass
should be taken immediately.

600
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,740
No matter how dirty

601
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,420
you see their hands grabbing the food,

602
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,740
don't show it.

603
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,460
Only when you sincerely

604
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,940
accept and blend in,

605
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,940
will they treat you as their own.

606
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,540
Only then can you
get the information you want.

607
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,860
Lastly,

608
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,820
no matter how hungry you are,

609
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,740
don't finish the food,

610
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,820
and leave some for the local gods.

611
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,420
Leave some of it?

612
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,980
Do their local gods eat leftovers?

613
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,860
I am...

614
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,380
I am just curious.

615
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,860
I asked out of curiosity.

616
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:43,270
[Incantation]

617
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,540
Sen,

618
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,100
what are they doing?

619
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,500
Dawala is seeing patients.

620
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,540
Seeing patients?

621
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,620
How is the child?

622
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,100
She asked how is the child.

623
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,260
I prescribed some medication,

624
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
it should relieve.

625
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,020
Medications were prescribed
to the child.

626
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,220
Take it slowly.

627
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Ask her for me,

628
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,700
does anyone else have this symptom?

629
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,380
Does anyone else in the village
have this symptom?

630
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,860
Many children have had this disease

631
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,060
for many years.

632
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,100
Dawala couldn't cure it,

633
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,660
saying that God had cursed this place.

634
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,260
She said many children
have had this disease

635
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,300
for many years.

636
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Dawala couldn't cure it,

637
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,300
saying that God had cursed this place.

638
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,260
I'll sterilize him,

639
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,340
it might hurt a little.

640
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,860
She is treating the wound,

641
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,900
it may be a little painful.

642
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,060
Please bear with the pain.

643
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,380
Don't cry, don't cry, mom is here.

644
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,980
Be a good boy. Just bear with it.

645
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,860
The pain will cease
after a while, don't cry.

646
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,620
Don't cry, don't cry, mom is here.

647
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,260
Don't cry, bear with it.

648
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,380
Don't cry.

649
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,780
Sen,

650
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:10,900
how was it?

651
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,140
Does the Chief recognize this herb?

652
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,340
The Chief said,

653
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,340
back then, they used this plant
to make tea.

654
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,580
Are there some nearby?

655
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,100
There used to be many
in the nearby mountains,

656
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,140
but they have all disappeared
in recent years.

657
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,900
People in the village

658
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,060
weren't able to drink this herbal tea
for long.

659
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,220
Chief said there are some
at the higher altitudes of the mountains.

660
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,340
A hunter in the village collected them.

661
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,100
I asked him to draw us a road map.

662
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,660
That's great.

663
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,780
But Sen,

664
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,420
this rainy season
will take at least over a month,

665
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,380
I can't wait any longer.

666
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,780
You can't wait either.

667
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,780
It's too dangerous to go to the mountains
during the rainy season.

668
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,460
Sen,

669
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,820
we'll go when the rain stops.

670
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,860
Will you be confident?

671
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,540
To be honest,

672
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,860
the situation in the mountains
is complicated.

673
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,380
I can't guarantee
with absolute certainty,

674
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,220
but I will do my best
to keep you all safe.

675
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,340
Thank you.

676
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,540
For you.

677
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
Three times a day.

678
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,460
One at a time.

679
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,180
Three times a day, one at a time.

680
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,180
Thank you.

681
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:37,660
Alright.

682
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,420
Thank you.

683
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,180
Next.

684
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,620
Come, follow me.

685
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,660
Uncle Hans.

686
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,060
How is it, Mint?

687
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,620
I've investigated it.

688
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,940
This virus has been in this village

689
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,100
for several years.

690
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,380
However, there was a little boy
named Miao Lun,

691
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,820
whose symptoms were relatively mild.

692
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,100
When I went to his house,

693
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,300
I found out that his sister

694
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,540
would add a plant called Perdo
when she was cooking.

695
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,140
And I learned that

696
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,380
people here

697
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,700
used to brew Perdo in water
and drink it as tea.

698
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,460
But don't know why

699
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,500
the plant doesn't grow anymore recently.

700
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,620
Uncle Hans,

701
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,620
judging from your years of experience,

702
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,180
could the big difference in the symptoms

703
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,220
of the children related to this plant?

704
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,460
I can't draw a conclusion now.

705
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,660
I need more verification.

706
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,460
I'm just speculating.

707
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,140
But I want to go into the mountains
with Yunshen,

708
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,940
to collect some samples of this plant

709
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,140
and do some research together.

710
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,860
Sure.

711
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,500
I'll meet you right away

712
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,980
after I've taken care of
the things here.

713
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:56,580
Sure.

714
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,260
Fu Yunshen.

715
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,860
Coming just by the smell?

716
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,340
What are you doing?

717
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:28,980
Don't move.

718
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,700
It's leaking.

719
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,420
Sit here.

720
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,940
Wow, it smells great.

721
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,980
Of course.

722
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,740
I really didn't expect

723
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,420
- that you can...
- Don't touch. Put it down.

724
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,100
You can actually cook.

725
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,500
My Grandpa forced me to cook

726
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,980
since I was a child.

727
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,060
My Grandpa's cooking is terrible,

728
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,940
but he likes creating trouble
for himself.

729
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,340
Unlike me,

730
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,100
I have had wisdom since I was a child,

731
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,220
and when I cook,
it will be at the master's level.

732
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,300
What a narcissistic person.

733
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,580
- Is it ready?
- Almost there.

734
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:16,900
Why the hurry?

735
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,460
When it will be ready?

736
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,620
Why the hurry?

737
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,340
Why is it so hot?

738
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,820
Initially,

739
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,940
I wanted to call you
after the food is ready,

740
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,140
but you came after smelling it.

741
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,620
Is your zodiac sign a dog?

742
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,740
Didn't you say you want to eat this?

743
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,500
When did I say I wanted to eat this?

744
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,700
In your dreams,

745
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,460
you said,

746
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,020
"Grandma,

747
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,220
small wonton, crab dumplings,
and Plain Noodle Soup."

748
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,340
Really?

749
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,300
Are you going to eat it or not?
If you're not, then give it to me.

750
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,540
Don't. I'll eat.

751
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,660
Be careful, it's hot.
