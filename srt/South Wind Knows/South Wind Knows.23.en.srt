00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,540
there might be a failure

377
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,380
under unknown circumstances.

378
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,060
I need that data from you.

379
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,380
There haven't been

380
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,940
cases of vaccine failure
in the country so far.

381
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,140
I have ordered them

382
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,340
to suspend all vaccinations,

383
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,660
seal the inventory,

384
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,700
and prepare the samples.

385
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,100
You can pick it up anytime.

386
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,820
This was just compiled.

387
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,220
These are the domestic

388
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,020
and Malaysian vaccine sales records.

389
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,460
Miss Gu, sorry.

390
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,780
It is over.

391
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,660

(Look.)

418
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,100
(Liver lesions)

419
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,860
(show diffuse distributions of tissue.)

420
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,260
(There are no obvious nodules.)

421
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,900
(So it can't be surgically removed.)

422
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,940
(Radiotherapy and chemotherapy
aren't definitive either.)

423
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,460
(It will be physically too hard to bear)

424
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,740
(for old people.)

425
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,540
(Fortunately,)

426
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,380
(there are no signs
of spread and metastasis.)

427
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,300
(So I suggest)

428
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,220
(you consider a liver transplant.)

429
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,700
Hello, Granny Hou.

430
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,260
Hello.

431
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:15,980
Granny.

432
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,900
Why are you back so late?

433
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,860
I was working overtime.

434
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,460
Why did you wait for me?

435
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,260
I was worried since you weren't back.

436
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,700
I'm sorry.

437
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,020
You must be hungry.

438
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,060
A little.

439
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,620
I made wontons

440
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,860
while waiting for you.

441
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,380
You're the best, Granny.

442
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,340
I'll cook them for you.

443
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,980
Are you cold?

444
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,100
Darling.

445
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,860
The wontons are ready.

446
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,380
Granny.

447
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,620
Eat slowly.

448
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,380
It's hot.

449
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,820
(Darling.)

450
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,540
(The wontons are ready.)

451
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,780
I'll sit here with you.

452
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,820
Let's eat it together.

453
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,060
We'll sit here to eat.

454
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,100
Smell it.

455
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,100
Smells good?

456
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,420
Take it.

457
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,380
Try it.

458
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,220
Take a bite.

459
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,740
It's yummy.

460
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,260
Then eat more.

461
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,900
What's wrong?

462
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,780
Nothing's wrong. It's so delicious.

463
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,020
Granny.

464
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,500
The wontons taste a bit too salty today.

465
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,060
Did I put in too much soy sauce?

466
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,420
Just kidding.

467
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,140
There's more in the pot.

468
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,420
Granny.

469
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,820
Darling.

470
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,780
The light in my room isn't working.

471
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,980
Can I sleep with you tonight?

472
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,260
Quickly get in here.

473
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,580
Come here.

474
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,020
Is this bright enough?

475
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,300
Yes.

476
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,740
You still can't get rid of
this childhood habit of yours.

477
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,620
Why are your feet so cold?

478
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,420
Give me your feet.

479
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,340
- I'll cover them.
- It's ticklish.

480
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,340
Granny.

481
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,540
You are so warm.

482
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,220
Darling.

483
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,260
When you were eating wontons earlier,

484
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,660
I noticed that you seemed upset.

485
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,180
Are you facing any troubles at work?

486
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,340
No.

487
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,900
That means you quarreled with Yunshen.

488
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,060
No.

489
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,180
You are too strong-willed.

490
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,140
If there is a conflict between you two,

491
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,380
just talk it out.

492
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,340
Be understanding of each other.

493
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,700
Don't end up pushing Yunshen away.

494
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,460
Are you worried
that no one will marry me?

495
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
Not at all.

496
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,180
But you're not young anymore.

497
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,780
You can't waste any more time.

498
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,500
I have gone through it.

499
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,980
I know what it's like to be lonely.

500
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,700
I'm lucky to have you with me.

501
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,580
But I can't be with you forever.

502
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,420
If you have someone
caring and considerate

503
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,580
to love you and be with you,

504
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,020
I won't be worried anymore.

505
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,020
I get it.

506
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,020
Don't worry.

507
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,660
No need to worry about me.

508
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,900
I'm not worried about my granddaughter.

509
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,580
I'm sure there will be

510
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,860
a long line of admirers
waiting to pursue you.

511
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,420
Let's go to sleep.

512
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,460
You have work tomorrow.

513
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,220
Okay.

514
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,980
- Let's sleep.
- Yes, let's sleep.

515
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,180
- Tuck yourself in.
- Okay.

516
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,260
- It's cozy.
- Alright.

517
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,980
You should lie down too.

518
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,940
Good night, Granny.

519
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,820
Good night.

520
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,420
Granny, I'm afraid of the dark.

521
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,780
I'll turn it back on.

522
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,980
Is that better?

523
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,900
Granny.

524
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,140
I'm scared of the dark.

525
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,780
Then I'll leave the light on for you.

526
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,900
Granny.

527
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,700
Can I sleep with you from now on?

528
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,940
I'll sleep right next to you.

529
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,940
We'll share a bed.

530
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,500
Fu Xizhou.

531
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,780
What are you doing here?

532
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,180
It's already so late.

533
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,580
I've always followed you around closely.

534
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,380
Did you think I was annoying?

535
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,180
Ruanruan.

536
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,620
I think I can explain

537
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,300
what happened today.

538
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,300
Back then,
you only had to respond to me a little

539
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,980
and I would be so happy.

540
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,220
But now, the closer I got,

541
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,500
the more I wanted.

542
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,740
I started to become greedy.

543
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,380
I kept hoping that you would
give me the same response.

544
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,180
Sorry.

545
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:23,740
Hello?

546
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,340
Yes.

547
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,460
All the materials I asked for.

548
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,580
I want them ready.

549
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,940
Yes, right away.

550
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,580
Sorry.

551
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,820
You don't have to apologize.

552
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,700
I was always hoping

553
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,860
that we could have

554
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,380
a happy ending like they do

555
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,260
in the girls' comics that I like.

556
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,180
But I guess I've overestimated myself.

557
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,020
To you,

558
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,580
I will always be the abandoned one.

559
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,060
Ruanruan.

560
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,540
I promise you.

561
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,700
After this,

562
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,980
I will make it up to you
with a momentous ceremony.

563
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,180
Okay?

564
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,980
Sorry.

565
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,660
Hello?

566
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,700
Stop calling me.

567
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,860
I've gotten home.

568
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,940
I have my passport.

569
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,900
Stop rushing me.

570
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,380
Sorry.

571
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,180
You can stop apologizing.

572
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,060
I should be the one saying sorry.

573
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,780
You are so busy and tired every day.

574
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,460
But all I did was do as I pleased

575
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,340
and followed you around
like I was your tail.

576
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,460
I'm sorry.

577
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,860
I won't do that anymore.

578
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,460
Ruanruan.

579
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,860
Ruanruan.

580
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,820
[Yunshen]
(I was busy.)

581
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,900
(I didn't check my phone.)

582
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,060
(I have to go to Malaysia.)

583
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,660
(I might be too busy
to answer your call.)

584
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,260
(You can leave me messages on WeChat.)

585
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,460
(Don't miss me too much.)

586
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,780
(But I will certainly miss you a lot.)

587
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,180
(Granny is sick.)

588
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,020
(It's very serious.)

589
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,620
(I don't know what to do.)

590
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,140
(Alright.)

591
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,700
(I'll be waiting for you.)

592
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,460
(Take good care of yourself.)

593
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,460
Mr. Fu and Mr. Fu Jr.

594
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,660
I am Mr. Xie's secretary.

595
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,940
- Good to see you.
- Me too.

596
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,220
How are the patients doing?

597
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,700
Just elementary school kids.

598
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,620
Nothing serious.

599
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,340
They're under observation
at the hospital.

600
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,180
We did that
to appease consumers as well.

601
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,340
Let's head to the company first.

602
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,820
Mr. Xie prepared a meal

603
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,820
to welcome both of you.

604
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,020
- Go to the hospital first.
- Go to the hospital first.

605
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,420
It's not a life-threatening illness.

606
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,540
The priority now is to solve this matter

607
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,460
and make up for the loss.

608
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,260
Mr. Xie has been too worried
to even sleep.

609
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,060
I finally get why public opinion
has been leaning to one side.

610
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,420
We are here to solve this matter.

611
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,740
The hospital first.

612
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,860
This way, please.

613
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,460
Zhu Jiu.

614
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,060
Why are you here so early
in the morning?

615
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,060
What is it that you couldn't tell me
on the phone?

616
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,460
Come on. Let's talk inside.

617
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,220
I still need to make breakfast
for your cousin.

618
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:17,820
Aunt.

619
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,620
I'll talk to you here.

620
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,580
Yang can't know about this.

621
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,180
What is it?

622
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,260
Granny...

623
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,100
Granny has liver cancer.

624
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,660
It is in the late stage.

625
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,460
Cancer?

626
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,580
What should we do?

627
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,220
How much is that going to cost?

628
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,180
What should we do, Zhu Jiu?

629
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,820
You're a doctor. You should know.

630
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,500
Cancer treatment costs a lot of money.

631
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,820
Will selling the house be enough?

632
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,260
I doubt we can keep your granny's

633
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,100
small courtyard house.

634
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,860
Aunt.

635
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,940
Don't worry about the medical expenses.

636
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,660
I will take care of it.

637
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,660
I didn't come here to ask you

638
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,540
to share the medical expenses either.

639
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,420
That's how it should be anyway.

640
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,220
All these years,

641
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,460
your granny

642
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,540
spent all her money sending you abroad.

643
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,100
We didn't take any money from her.

644
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,540
Aunt.

645
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,540
Don't tell Granny about this yet.

646
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,860
Okay, I know. I won't.

647
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,260
It's a serious illness.

648
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,540
It would be a great shock to her.

649
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,740
What else did the doctor say?

650
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,340
Can you spare some time today

651
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,940
to meet her attending doctor with me
at the hospital?

652
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,780
Sure.

653
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,020
Nothing is more important

654
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,020
than your granny's illness now.

655
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,220
I will ask for a leave of absence
with my superior later.

656
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,780
After Yang has gone to school,

657
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,180
I'll go meet you at the hospital.

658
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,540
Okay.

659
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,060
See you at the hospital later.

660
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,060
I have to go back and cook.

661
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,820
Use it to soothe your eyes.

662
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,260
Look at you.

663
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,420
You look like Ultraman
with your swollen eyes.

664
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,300
Ruanruan.

665
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,820
Do you want to hear a joke?

666
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,740
Once upon a time,
two tomatoes were walking on the street.

667
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,940
They kept walking and walking.

668
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,140
Suddenly, a car whizzed by.

669
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,300
It flew across

670
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,460
and flattened one of the tomatoes.

671
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,140
What do you think

672
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,580
the other tomato said?

673
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,140
It said,

674
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,060
"Why have you turned into ketchup?"

675
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,780
I have another one.
Do you want to hear it?

676
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,060
I'm sorry, Ruanruan.

677
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,420
I guess I'm really a boring person.

678
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,420
I can't even tell a proper joke.

679
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,300
The joke earlier
was pretty funny, right?

680
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,020
I find you funny.

681
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,860
Okay, no more jokes.

682
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,580
Well...

683
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,700
It's all because of that lame joke.

684
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,100
I won't tell it again.

685
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,060
Zhizhi.

686
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,460
I find myself so pathetic.

687
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,260
I feel like I have been begging someone
for happiness.

688
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,700
It's not like that.

689
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,820
Don't think that way.

690
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,540
Fu Xizhou...

691
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,700
He's just not good

692
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,580
at expressing his feelings.

693
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,060
Don't overthink it.

694
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,620
Hush now.

695
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,420
I don't want to wait for him anymore.

696
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,020
Ruanruan.

697
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,180
You are still emotional now.

698
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,540
Don't jump to conclusions.

699
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,220
Okay?

700
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,380
Zhizhi.

701
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,260
You know what?

702
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,500
The two of us talked it out seriously
the other day.

703
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,660
I kept saying

704
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,660
that there should be honesty and trust

705
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,340
between spouses.

706
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,860
But I didn't mention love at all.

707
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,500
Because I was afraid.

708
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,820
I was afraid to ask if he loved me.

709
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,740
I was afraid to know the answer.

710
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,180
Fu Xizhou, that jerk!

711
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,260
Once he gets back,

712
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,980
I will teach him a good lesson.

713
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,300
I want to leave him.

714
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,260
Please come in.

715
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,020
Hi, Sam.

716
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,300
I'm Yunshen.

717
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,060
I apologize for everything

718
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,380
that you went through.

719
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,540
You are?

720
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,940
Your child received
our company's vaccine.

721
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,180
I'm so sorry

722
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,460
for what he suffered

723
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,980
and for making you worried.

724
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,380
Is your vaccine fake?

725
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,780
If anything happens to my son,

726
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,300
I will not let you get away with it.

727
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,900
I'm very sorry.

728
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,380
But the vaccine is not fake.

729
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,220
We are investigating

730
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,100
the reason why it failed.

731
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,220
And we will give you an answer.

732
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,300
Who knows if your words can be trusted?

733
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,580
Aside from
the child's hospital expenses,

734
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,380
this is additional compensation

735
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,300
that Lingtian Pharmaceutical
is giving the child.

736
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,580
Contact me at any time.

737
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,740
What do you mean by this?

738
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,940
Don't take it wrong.

739
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,860
It's just something
that we want to do for you.

740
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,340
I want an answer. Not this money.

741
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,540
We will have an answer for everyone.

742
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,380
Just give us a little time.

743
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,220
I hope you do what you promised.

744
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,260
Okay. We won't bother you anymore.

745
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,780
Goodbye.

746
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,740
I will check the hospital's
refrigeration conditions

747
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,540
