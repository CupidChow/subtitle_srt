Can you believe this?

27
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,860
Why?

28
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,620
Because of that female doctor.

29

You wouldn't tell on the phone.

We met when we were in Country M.

treated her differently.

But I didn't know how to say this.

Besides, Fu Yushen got in an accident
not long after he returned.

52
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,420

I want to give up.

57
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,700
You want to give up Fu Yunshen?

58
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,580
I used to think

59
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,780
that as long as I tried harder

60
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,340
and became braver,

61
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,380
things would be different.

62

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,460
I realized

64
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,100
nothing had changed.

I don't regret going into medicine.

To be honest,

71
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,420
I'm not willing to let go

72
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,580
and I can't stand doing so.

73
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,380
But, Ruanruan,

74
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,860
I'm scared.

75

00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,020
You can tell that?

118
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,300
I do miss Granny.

119
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,660
In previous years,

120
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,940
I used to fly back for Chinese New Year.

121
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,220
Because I didn't want her to be alone.

122
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,180
But don't worry.

123
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,980
I gave her a call just now.

124
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,180
Her voice told me she was happy.

125
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,860
Perhaps she pretended like that
to not worry me.

126
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,660
She told me she'd celebrate
with her friends.

127
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,380
That's good.

128
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,060

129
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,500
Is he in pink health?

130
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,100
Grandpa is doing pretty well.

131
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,260
My brother and Ruanruan are with him.

132
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,980
My mother takes care of him too.

133
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,740
He won't be alone.

134
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,860
You haven't talked
in a long while, right?

135
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,500
I don't know

136
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,300
how to face Grandpa.

137
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,180
I don't want to upset him.

138
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,740
But I can't bring myself

139
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,660
to comfort him either.

140
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,380
Anyway, Linda

141
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,700

142

143
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,900
But I think your grandpa
must have missed you very much.

144
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,340
Perhaps your voice

145
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,580
is enough to soothe him.

146
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,260
I go and get the door.

147
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,420

151
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,060
You wouldn't enjoy such delicious food
without me.

152
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,020
It's hot, right?

153
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,060
Yeah.

154
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,020
Let me blow on your hand.

155
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,700
Show some respect to the third wheel,

156
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,620
will you?

157
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,380
Mint.

158
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,940
This is glutinous sesame, isn't it?

159
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,380
Practice your cooking skills, please.

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,900
Eat this.

162
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,540
No.

163
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,820
I prefer glutinous tangyuans
that are cooked longer.

164
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,020
I don't do much exercise,

165
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,980
so they help with digestion.

166

169
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:29,820
Eat this.

170
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,940
I can't eat this anymore.

171
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,300
Why did I even come here for?

172
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,020
It's Chinese New Year,
not Valentine's Day.

173
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,700
Let's go.

174
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,860
Wutong, let's go.

175
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,620
Let's leave.

176
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,020
Stop talking when you're eating.

177
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,220
Be gentle.

178
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,180
The dishes are in place.

179
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,140
Put the fish in the center.

180
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,380
We'll have more than a surplus every year.
[*"Surplus" and "fish" are homophones.]

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,860
Dinner is ready?

Yes.

183
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,540
Where's Grandpa?

184
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,300
What's wrong with him?

185
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,620
He was happy just now.

186
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,260
He misses Yunshen.

187
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,100
Go and talk to him.

188
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,540
Grandpa.

189
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,220
Why the long face on this festive day?

190
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,220
Call Yunshen if you miss him.

191
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,100
Call him?

192
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,100
He hung up on me

193
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,180
and screened my calls.

194
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,940
It's embarrassing if I call him again.

195
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,220
- Oh, my.
- Dad.

196
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,900
Well...

197
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,460
You're the closest to Yunshen,
aren't you?

198
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,140
He doesn't contact us

199
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,580
probably because he doesn't want
to worry us

200
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,980
with his vulnerable side.

201
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,580
Still, he should give me a call
on New Year's Eve.

202
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,780
If I drop dead,

203
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,380
he'll regret this for sure.

204
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,140
Dad.

205
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,780
Don't say that.

206
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,420
Touch wood.

207
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,420
I'll call him.

208
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,100
No, don't call him.

209
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,300
Jeez.

210
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,060
It's ringing.

211
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,140
He didn't answer the call.

212
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,180
See, I told you so.

213
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,220
I knew it.

214
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,660
Well, Dad. Come on.

215
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,580
Let's have the reunion dinner.

216
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,700
No, I don't want to eat.

217
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,580
Let's go.

218
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,340
You enjoy yourself.

219
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,660
Grandpa.

220
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,100
It's Yunshen.

221
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,660
Give it to me.

222
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,180
Yunshen.

223
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,420
How are you doing?

224
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,580
Are you faring well?

225
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,260
I've missed you so much.

226
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,500
You look skinnier.

227
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,740
- What has happened?
- I want to talk to him.

228
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,540
Leave me alone.

229
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,020
You're in good spirits.

230
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,740
Have you gotten used to life over there?

231
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,420
Yes, Grandpa.

232
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,220
Don't worry.

233
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,580
How's your health?

234
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,420
Are you doing well?

235
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,860
Not well.

236
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,740
I can't eat or sleep.

237
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,780
Fu Yunshen.

238
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,500
Grandpa misses you so much
that he's throwing a tantrum

239
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,540
and refuses to eat dinner.

240
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,340
Apologize to him now.

241
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,140
How come my young and handsome grandpa

242
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,380
has become grumpy?

243
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,140
Grandpa.

244
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,300
How about I give you a surprise?

245
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:51,900
Well.

246
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,580
Let me introduce

247
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,900
your future granddaughter-in-law to you.

248
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,580
She's Zhu Jiu, my girlfriend.

249
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,260
Nice to meet you, Grandpa.

250
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,420
Mrs. Fu.

251
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,420
Ruanruan.

252
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,140
Hello, Miss Zhu.

253
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,140
Please enjoy your chat.

254
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:08,940
Yunshen.

255
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
What's going on now?

256
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,860
This is a big decision
and yet you didn't discuss it with us.

257
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,860
You're insensible.

258
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,140
No, I'll talk to him about this.

259
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,660
No, Dad.

260
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,540
I'll do this.

261
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,180
You go and prepare for the dinner.

262
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:17,860
Enough.

263
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,620
Let's go, Madam Jiang.

264
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,420
Enough.

265
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,620
Ruanruan.

266
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,260
Do you know anything
about Yunshen's girlfriend?

267
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,780
No.

268
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,780
Calm down.

269
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,700
You can ask him
after Grandpa finishes the call.

270
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,820
I'll give her a hand.

271
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,660
Yunshen.

272
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,820
Dating with a woman is something big.

273
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,980
Don't worry, Grandpa.

274
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,860
I'm faring well here. Look at me.

275
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,660
Where's Xizhou?

276
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,060
He went to the restroom.

277
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,220
I'll go and get him.

278
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,620
No, Grandpa.

279
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,540
Let's talk first.

280
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
Sure.

281
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,660
How's the weather over there?

282
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,660
Pretty good.

283
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,700
Really?

284
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,100
How about the weather in Shanghai?

285
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,740
It's good too.

286
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,100
Not bad.

287
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,380
Grandpa, you must take care
of your health.

288
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,020
I will.

289
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,380
Turn your face to me.

290
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,220
What do you want to do?

291
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,340
Come here.

292
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,900
How cute!

293
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,380
How beautiful!

294
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,660
Are you sure?

295
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,860
Let me see.

296
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,740
In that case,

297
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,180
we must

298
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,580
have a daughter in the future.

299
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,980
So that

300
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,940
she can rescue her dad

301
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,460
from her mum's bullying.

302
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,420
You're so picky.

303
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,620
Take it off if you don't like it.

304
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,180
No, it's not that.

305
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,140
Can you not fantasize about things

306
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,860
all the time?

307
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,020
Zhu Jiu.

308
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,420
Once I recover,

309
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,180
I'll take you out for a date.

310
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,060
We'll dine in a restaurant,

311
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,140
watch a movie,

312
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,300
and go hiking.

313
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,900
Unlike now,

314
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,380
staying at home with me.

315
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,660
Leo told me

316
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,420
that international students like you
care much about Chinese New Year.

317
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,220
Do you want to join them
for the gathering?

318
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,340
Of course, I don't want to.

319
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,740
I want to stay here with you.

320
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,300
I don't like noisy gatherings.

321
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,100
When I was little,

322
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,260
Granny used to buy me fireworks
during Chinese New Year.

323
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,180
Did you know

324
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,380
sparklers?

325
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,140
Have you played those before?

326
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,380
No.

327
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,300
Grandpa only bought me huge fireworks.

328
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,660
Fu Yunshen. You're showing off, huh?

329
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,660
I was kidding.

330
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,900
When I was little,

331
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,460
I always played with my brother.

332
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,260
But I was naughty,

333
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,580
and I scared him a lot.

334
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,460
I envy you so much.

335
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,540
You have a big brother.

336
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,980
I used to be alone back then.

337
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:04,820
Zhu Jiu.

338
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,700
Close your eyes.

339
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,740
Why?

340
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,300
Close your eyes.

341
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,740
I want to perform a magic trick for you.

342
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,180
All right.

343
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,620
I'll trust you once.

344
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,740
Don't fool me.

345
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,700
No, I won't. Close your eyes tight.

346
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,620
When did you learn the magic trick?

347
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,420
When did you buy this?

348
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,980
I really wanted this when I was little.

349
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,980
One more.

350
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,620
Okay.

351
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,380
- Can I have two?
- Here you go.

352
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
You should light up one for yourself.

353
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,820
Okay.

354
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,060
I didn't know you were a romantic guy.

355
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:13,900
Yunshen.

356
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,420
Did you know your wish will be answered

357
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,540
if you make a wish upon a sparkler?

358
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,580
Your wish will come true quicker

359
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,340
if you wish upon me.

360
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,380
Fine.

361
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,460
If so, I'll make a wish
upon the sparkler

362
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,340
and you.

363
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,940
I hope Yunshen can stay safe

364
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,340
and healthy forever.

365
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,900
All right.

366
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,020
From this year on, I'll stay up all night
on Chinese New Year's Eve

367
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,780
and New Year countdown with you.

368
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,180
We'll celebrate in our twenties,

369
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,100
thirties,

370
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,020
forties,

371
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,580
fifties,

372
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,660
sixties, seventies, eighties,
and nineties

373
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,460
together.

374
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,100
We will.

375
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,820
Pinky, pinky bow-bell.

376
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,100
Whoever tells a lie will sink down
into a bad place

377
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,780
and never rise up again.

378
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,300

Will you work overtime today?

405

Let's go on a date.

406
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,660
You see,

407
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,380
I've been working late hours
at the gallery

408
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,140
before Chinese New Year,

409
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,860
and you've been on business trips.

410
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,580
While we had a break,

411
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,300
we had to return

412
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,820
to our parents' home.

413
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,100
It's been a long while
since we spent time alone.

414
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,540
You're married with a wife,

415
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,380
don't you feel pathetic

416
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,060
for working all day long?

417
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:42,940
Here.

418
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100
After hearing what you said,

419
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,180
I do find myself pretty pathetic.

420
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,580
Let's go on a date today.

421
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,300
I want to check out wedding gowns.

422
00:20:59,540 --> 00:20:59,940
All right.

423
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,780
Really?

424
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,460
I'll go and get changed now.

425
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,620
Shift my schedule to the nighttime.

426
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,700
You're awake.

427
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,100
How do you feel now?

428
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,500
Does it hurt?

429
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,140
I'm skinnier.

430
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,340
You won't lose weight in just one day.

431
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,700
Maybe two days?

432
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,500
Do your legs feel anything?

433
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,260
No.

434
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,780
How about this?

435
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,260
No.

436
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,060
It shouldn't be.

437
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,900
You should've felt something
right after the operation.

438
00:22:59,220 --> 00:22:59,900
Ouch!

439
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,380
I'm sorry.

440
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,500
That hurts.

441
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,060
Fu Yunshen, you liar!

442
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,220
Dr. Zhu.

443
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,700
I'm a patient.

444
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,140
I need care.

445
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,860
Congratulations.

446
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,740
Finally, you can feel pain.

447
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,380
Is this nice?

448
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:14,900
Nice.

449
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,660
Hello, James.

450
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,940
How's your analysis result

451
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,940
of the Singaporean company?

452
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,140
I'll try on the next one.

453
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:28,740
Sure.

454
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,740
Okay.

455
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,660
Make this quick.

456
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,500
Xizhou.

457
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,620
How about this one?

458
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,700
Very good.

459
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,140
Regarding this,

460
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,020
figure out the content in the contract
as soon as possible.

461
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,500
Fine.

462
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,460
Gather all the information.

463
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:29,780
Not bad.

464
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,460
Pretty good.

465
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,620
Okay.

466
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,580
I'll hang up.

467
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,540
"No problem", "pretty good", and "nice".

468
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,740
Don't they mean the same thing?

469
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,260
I've tried on so many gowns.

470
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,500
You can decide on your favorite one.

471
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,140
If not, buy them all.

472
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,020
I need to take this.

473
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,220
Hello, go on.

474
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,420
Luo Jiang signed the contract
with Singapore on his own accord.

475
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,580
The terms are the ones
you rejected before.

476
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,900
Where's he now?

477
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,380
At the office.

478
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,340
Hold the contract.

479
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,180
Okay.

480
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,380
Book me a flight
to Singapore immediately.

481
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,500
Right away.

482
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,580
Okay, don't worry.

483
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,540
Ruanruan?

484
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,860
Excuse me.

485
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:30,940
Yes?

486
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,620
Where's my wife?

487
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,980
She said she didn't want to disturb you,

488
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,060
so she left first.

489
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,580
Thank you.

490
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,660
You're welcome.

491
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,940
This is infuriating!

492
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,300
Did you really leave Xizhou
at the bridal boutique

493
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,180
and ran away?

494
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,340
I did.

495
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,180
Very good, Gu Ruanruan.

496
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,900
Well done!

497
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,940
Which side do you take?

498
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,980
Why are you so happy
when he walks over me?

499
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,180
I really think

500
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,260
you've done well on this.

501
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,220
But,

502
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,580
didn't you decide
on the wedding gown before?

503
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,780
Why are you choosing it again?

504
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,740
Yes, I did.

505
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,780
But I saw more beautiful ones

506
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,380
when I went shopping.

507
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,100
What I care isn't about the gown.

508
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,780
I just want him
to spend more time with me.

509
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,940
Marriage is about two people.

510
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,900
I hope we are involved

511
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,700
in every step.

512
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,460
Look at him now.

513
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,980
He's been talking on the phone
all the while.

514
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,420
Why should I be his wife?

515
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,900
I want to be his phone

516
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,940
so he can talk to me every day.

517
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,340
Zhou Zhizhi.

518
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,020
Stop laughing, or I'll break you off.

519
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,940
Well, I won't laugh.

520
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,060
Ruanruan.

521
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,620
If you want Xizhou to accompany you,

522
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,980
don't go shopping.

523
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,220
Men don't really enjoy shopping,

524
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,180
especially during wedding photography.

525
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,420
They feel

526
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,860
that they're just a prop.

527
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,780
Xizhou is a man with a rigid mind.

528
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,060
He really cares about you

529
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,060
when he goes shopping with you.

530
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,700
It's not a pleasant experience.

531
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Maybe he thought you liked all the gowns,
that's why you couldn't decide.

532
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,100
So he told you to buy them all.

533
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,340
Well,

534
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,380
you should tell him what you mean.

535
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,300
That's the right way to do it.

536
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,740
Really?

537
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,660
Of course.

538
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,830
[Xizhou]

539
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,340
Pick it up.

540
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,340
I think

541
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,100
he's already learned his mistake.

542
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,820
Ruanruan, where are you?

543
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,060
Zhizhi's place.

544
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,620
Can you ask Zhizhi
to send you home later?

545
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,820
I have something urgent now.

546
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,580
I need to fly to Singapore.

547
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
I'll accompany you next week.

548
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,580
Let's do anything you like.

549
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,540
You said he'd learned his mistake?

550
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,070
[This one suits you the best!]

551
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,300
Gave me a carrot after the stick?

552
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,820
Like I care.

553
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:25,930
[Xizhou, don't drink so much alcohol.]

554
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,220
(I've been staying overseas for years,)

555
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,340
I still find Chinese cuisine
to be the best.

556
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,380
I can't get used to Western wine.

557
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,460
Today,

558
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,260
let's have some drinks

559
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,300
to celebrate our collaboration.

560
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,460
I'm sorry, Mr. He.

561
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,420
But my stomach doesn't feel well today.

562
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,540
We'll have a blast
when you come to Shanghai next time.

563

You don't accept my offer

564
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,140
or you don't want
a pleasant collaboration with me?

565
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,140
How could that be?

566
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,460
I'm looking forward to
collaborating with you.

567
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,180
That's why I flew all the way here
to discuss the contract with you.

568
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,380
What contract?

569
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,820
Didn't we just sign one lately?

570
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,860
I'm not satisfied with that one.

571
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,740
So, I bring you a new contract
this time.

572
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,260
[Drug Supply Contract]

573
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,900
Are you kidding me?

574
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,260
When it comes to business,

575
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,860
I'm serious about it.

576
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,980
That's strange.

577
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,180
I've been in business for years,

578
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,980
this is the first time I have encountered
such a strange thing today.

579
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,860
Your company
has been facing financial problems

580
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,420
for several months, right?

581
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,140
You requested to lower the cost
and extend payment terms

582
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,020
because you want to use Lingtian's order

583
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,500
to relieve your financial problems.

584
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,780
But concerning your company's situation,

585
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,300
I'm afraid it won't resolve
your problem from the root.

586
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,620
What are you trying to get at?

587
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,740
I'm having dinner
with Mr. He of Jinghui.

588
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,220
He wants to have a word with you.

589
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,740
It's James from Redstone Investments.

590
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,460
You've been wanting
to meet with him, right?

591
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,480
[James]

592
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,020
James.

593
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,900
I'm here to visit my girlfriend.

594
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,260
Okay. What's her name?

595
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,220
Come on.

596
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,660
Take it slow.

597
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:36,980
Careful.

598
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,020
Slow down.

599
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,820
Okay.

600
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,300
Okay.

601
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,380
Okay.

602
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:03,900
Enough.

603
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,100
We'll stop here today.

604
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:05,940
Okay?

605
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,900
I'm fine.

606
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,380
Let's go.

607
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,100
We try again.

608
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:10,900
Okay.

609
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,300
I'm fine.

610
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,740
Be careful.

611
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,620
He couldn't go on.

612
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,780
Just stop here.

613
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,260
Okay, we can take it slow.

614
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,660
Here.

615
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:36,940
Careful.

616
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,100
- No need to hurry, okay?
- Thank you.

617
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:51,900
Here.

618
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,100
Mr. Fu.

619
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,580
Well done.

620
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,780
Here's your reward.

621
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,380
Thank you.

622
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,260
The beginning is always the hardest.

623
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,860
Imagine yourself
as a toddler learning to walk.

624
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,820
Let me tell you a secret.

625
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,940
I only learned to walk when I was two.

626
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,180
What? Two?

627
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,620
That's slow.

628
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,540
Granny thought

629
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,580
something was wrong with my body.

630
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,900
However,

631
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,300
nothing's wrong with my body,

632
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,740
I'm just slow.

633
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,980
Do you mean up here?

634
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,700
Zhu Jiu, you're not slow.

635
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,700
You're a genius.

636
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,580
Scratch that.

637
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,420
I had a hard time
back in my school days.

638
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,420
When I was little, my first goal

639
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,140
is my parents' alma mater,

640
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,300
Heidelberg University School
of Medicine.

641
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,780
You're ambitious.

642
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,380
Therefore,

643
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,420
I must get admitted
to the best university in China

644
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,220
to earn that eligibility
to apply for it.

645
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,060
I spent most of my high school days

646
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,180
on studying.

647
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,780
I had no time
for extracurricular activities.

648
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,300
Wasn't it boring?

649
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,540
No, it's pretty good.

650
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,180
Stop thinking nonsense.

651
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,780
- Let go.
- No.

652
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,860
Let go.

653
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,660
Okay.

654
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,030
I had bad luck

655
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,980
when I was in my senior year
in high school.

656
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,220
I got a fever just before the exam.

657
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,500
So, I had to have an intravenous drip.

658
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,980
But it made me feel drowsy.

659
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,020
So I drank a lot of coffee.

660
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,780
Granny felt sorry for me.

661
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,060
She said

662
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,900
that I was still young,

663
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,340
I could repeat the grade

664
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,860
if I failed.

665
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,660
But Leo told me

666
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,100
you skipped a grade
when you were in university.

667
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,020
It turns out you worked so hard.

668
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,300
In this world,

669
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,500
not many are born geniuses.

670
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,140
The majority of us have to strive hard

671
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,540
to achieve the results.

672
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,220
You reap

673
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,260
what you sow.

674
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,540
Do you agree?

675
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,780
That's true.

676
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,580
Yunshen.

677
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,180
I'm sorry.

678
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,980
You're trying so hard.

679
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,180
But I can't help you much.

680
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,180
It's not hard at all.

681
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,460
Liar.

682
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,620
I mean it.

683
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,500
As long as you're with me,

684
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,460
nothing is hard for me.

685
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,580
Mr. Fu.

686
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,060
You are honey-tongued.

687
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,420
You must have dated many girls, right?

688
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,900
Dr. Zhu, you're sharp-eyed.

689
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,780
Did you get tricked a lot back then?

690
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,740
Impossible.

691
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,980
No one has the guts to deceive me.

692
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,060
Neither do you.

693
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,060
Ouch.

694
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,460
It's not that I daren't,

695
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,580
it's that I don't want to.

696
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,900
And I won't do that.

697
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:23,740
Zhu Jiu.

698
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,860
In this world,

699
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,700
you're the unique presence

700
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,300
for me.

701
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,620
You're also the best answer

702
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,660
in my heart.

703
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,420
The operation was a success.

704
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,380
Subsequent test results have been good.

705
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,180
But why can't we see the improvement?

706
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,540
It's true that Mr. Fu's progress

707
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,940
is slower than we expected.

708
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,340
If we don't see a meaningful recovery
in three months,

709
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,860
clinically or physiologically,

710
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,860
we'll have to perform
an exploratory surgery.

711
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:42,940
In the patient's recovery,
in addition to the physiological aspect,

712
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,980
there's also psychological work.

713
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,100
It requires

714
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,980
passion and a positive attitude

715
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,780
to achieve good results.

716
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,180
But...

717
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,700
This also goes for his family members.

718
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,220
Thank you.

719
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,100
