It's my first time making this.

Whenever I fell sick when I was little,

my mom would make me this dish.

38

Back then,

39
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,460
she needed to go
to a market that was really far away

40
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,700
to buy tofu puffs and meat.

41
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,140

after finishing one full bowl

Only a few tofu puffs
would be stuffed with meat.

My mom would give them all to me.

46
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,100

of the stuffed tofu.

For a long time,

my sister thought

49
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,780
that stuffed tofu soup with vermicelli
came with tofu puffs and vermicelli only.

When she cooked it for others,

51

they thought it wasn't delicious.

52
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,420

00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,620
that she had to make stuffed tofu puffs

54
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,900
to add more flavors to the soup.

55

It's highly likely
that we'll receive good news.

00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,420
I'm afraid that she can't wait till then.

190
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,060
It won't happen.

191
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,100
Yunshen.

192
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,340
I want to bring Granny back
to her hometown.

193
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,140
Are you sure about this?

194
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,260
Granny always tells me

195
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,140
that life is unpredictable.

196
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,940
We need to live in the present.

197
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,860
No one knows what will happen next.

198
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,380
Besides, you told me too.

199
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,820
You don't want Granny
to have any regrets.

200
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,100
Okay.

201
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,060
I'll go with you.

202
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,660
Let's depart

203
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,940
when Meng's condition is stable.

204
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,460
I'll arrange the trip.

205
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,780
Yunshen.

206
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,380
Thank you.

207
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,700
You don't have

208
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,340
to say thank you.

209
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,220
It's a weekend morning.

210
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,500
Why is he here?

211
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,340
Dad.

212
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:31,900
Madam Jiang.

213
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,460
I need to report something.

214
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,540
Later.

215
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,460
I'm having a meeting with Xizhou.

216
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,420
It's about the cold chain.

217
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,900
I believe Xizhou is here
for the same reason.

218
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,780
If Xizhou hadn't come,

219
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,700
would you be keeping this from me?

220
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,220
I wanted to tell you yesterday,

221
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,220
yet you were asleep.

222
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,340
So, I didn't want to disturb you.

223
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:55,900
Dad.

224
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,860
This is under Yunshen's charge.

225
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,460
Why is Xizhou involved?

226
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,340
I want to ask you.

227
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
Are you doubting Yunshen's ability?

228
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:06,980
Madam Jiang.

229
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,460
You've misunderstood.

230
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,420
I'm just reporting my work.

231
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,220
Since when do we have
weekly meetings during weekends?

232
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,340
As long as it's about the company,

233
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,140
there's no holiday.

234
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,140
Okay.

235
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,740
Xizhou is the Vice President.

236
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,460
He has the right to know

237
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,180
and make the decision.

238
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,420
All right.

239
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,940
This will be under Xizhou's charge now.

240
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:29,820
Dad.

241
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,540
Didn't you assign this to Yunshen?

242
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,500
I told Yunshen

243
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,220
to avert suspicion.

244
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,060
So, people won't use this against him.

245
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,500
What are you going to do with Jiang Jun?

246
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,380
Are you going to report to the police?

247
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,020
Look at you!

248
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,020
It's such a critical moment now,

249
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,460
yet you're still thinking
about your useless nephew!

250
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,220
Indeed, Jiang Jun did wrong.

251
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,900
But he was fooled.

252
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,540
He hasn't had a dad since little.

253
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,100
I raised him up.

254
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,740
I didn't raise him well.

255
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,300
I've asked him to resign.

256
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,500
You're right.

257
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,540
You spoiled Jiang Jun into what he is today.

258
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,780
Would he dare to do this
without your approval?

259
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,300
I had no hidden agenda.

260
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,500
I just wanted
to save costs for the company.

261
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,740
I've overlooked this.

262
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,500
I'll be more careful.

263
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,420
No hidden agenda?

264
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,540
Your finance department

265
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,260
has interfered
with the company's operations.

266
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,380
Grandpa.

267
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,820
Please calm down.

268
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,580
Madam Jiang meant well.

269
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,780
She's unfamiliar with her work,

270
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,380
which is why she got fooled.

271
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,700
Fu Xizhou.

272
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,540
Stop being pretentious.

273
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,100
You've been scheming

274
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,060
to bring the Jiang family down.

275
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,420
Are you contented now?

276
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,540
Look at you.

277
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,860
Xizhou never wanted to report Jiang Jun.

278
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,940
He even advised me

279
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,660
to handle it like a family matter.

280
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,780
How about you?

281
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,300
You blame him first.

282
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,540
Okay, that's enough.

283
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,460
You only think about your lovely nephew.

284
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,780
Don't be a CFO.

285
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,180
Just be a good aunt.

286
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:08,980
Dad.

287
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,900
What do you mean?

288
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,060
I mean it literally.

289
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,980
I overlooked this matter,

290
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,500
but I've been contributing
to the company for over two decades.

291
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,180
You can't just

292
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,820
fire me like this.

293
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,500
Let's call for a board meeting then.

294
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,620
No, Dad.

295
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,420
- You can't do this...
- Get out!

296
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,100
Grandpa.

297
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,700
If there's nothing else,

298
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,940
I'll head out too.

299
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,470
[Hospital]

300
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,420
Meng.

301
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,180
Shall we eat something?

302
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,220
Let's have some fruits,

303
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,980
okay?

304
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,980
I'm not feeling well.

305
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,180
You're not feeling well?

306
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:15,780
Okay.

307
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,700
- I...
- Mrs. Meng.

308
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,900
Dr. Zhu.

309
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,460
Madam Zhu.

310
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,580
Meng.

311
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,220
How are you feeling?

312
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,540
I'm feeling sick.

313
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,340
Meng.

314
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,820
I think

315
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,820
that you're the bravest girl in the world.

316
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,340
I need to ask you a favor.

317
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,820
These two days,

318
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,860
take your medications accordingly

319
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,100
and get your injections like a good girl.

320
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,700
Then, eat well too.

321
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,900
I promise

322
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,540
that you'll recover quickly.

323
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,220
Is that all right?

324
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,820
Okay.

325
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,940
Good girl.

326
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,780
Get some more sleep, okay?

327
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,100
I'll count to

328
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,740
one,

329
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,740
two,

330
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,940
three. Close your eyes.

331
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,340
Mrs. Meng.

332
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,020
What did Meng have for breakfast?

333
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,780
She just had a few spoonfuls of porridge.

334
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,460
She didn't like it.

335
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,300
So, she vomited.

336
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,500
That's not right.

337
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,980
She has just undergone a surgery.

338
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,380
Nutrition is important to her.

339
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,940
Even if she doesn't have the appetite,

340
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,780
you must coax her into eating something.

341
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,140
I understand, Dr. Zhu.

342
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,820
If there's anything,
you can alert the nurse.

343
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,500
Dr. Zhu.

344
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,140
Meng has just had a surgery.

345
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,740
She's still weak.

346
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,540
Whenever she's awake,

347
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,900
she'll be looking for you.

348
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,820
Please take good care of Meng.

349
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,860
Mrs. Meng.

350
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,260
Meng

351
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,420
has survived
the critical 48-hour postoperative period.

352
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,300
So, you don't have to worry so much.

353
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,180
If there's anything,

354
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,220
you can come to me.

355
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,860
I'm Dr. Zhu's supervisor.

356
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,460
Okay.

357
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,340
Thank you, Dr. Ji.

358
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:56,940
You're welcome.

359
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,740
Well, have a good rest.

360
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,460
Okay.

361
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,420
- Okay
- I'll leave you two to it.

362
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,060
We'll get going.

363
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,220
Be careful, Granny.

364
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,140
My little sister.

365
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,260
Sister.

366
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,820
Sister.

367
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,740
Sister!

368
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,020
I've missed you.

369
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,180
Why are you so skinny?

370
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,580
You aren't plump, either.

371
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,700
I know, right?

372
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,380
It has been years since we last met.

373
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,380
We're old now.

374
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,500
Indeed.

375
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,020
Yes.

376
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,020
Greetings, Grandaunt.

377
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,180
Is this Zhu Jiu?

378
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,620
That's right.

379
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,580
She's so beautiful.

380
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,860
Is this her husband?

381
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,460
Nice to meet you, Grandaunt. Yes.

382
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,340
Good.

383
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,780
Here.

384
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,860
Let's head inside.

385
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,820
- Okay.
- Come on.

386
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,700
Be careful.

387
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,100
Yunshen.

388
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,780
Guess which one is Granny.

389
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,980
Which one is Granny?

390
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,140
I need to have a close look.

391
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,740
I think...

392
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,020
This is Granny.

393
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:18,860
This.

394
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,820
Bingo!

395
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,540
This is Granny.

396
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,900
- This is Grandaunt.
- You guessed it right.

397
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,340
Granny, Grandaunt.

398
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,460
Be careful.

399
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,700
Look.

400
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,140
It's been ages since I came back.

401
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,900
I'm not used to this place now.

402
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,740
Slowly.

403
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,540
Here.

404
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,140
Come on.

405
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,060
Have a seat.

406
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,860
Okay.

407
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,660
Back then, we were around...

408
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,580
Around 15 years old.

409
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,300
That's right.

410
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,540
Around 15 years old.

411
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,380
You were beautiful.

412
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,060
Beautiful?

413
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,380
My granddaughter saw this and said

414
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,620
that it's so outdated.

415
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,140
Wow, Grandaunt knows the word 'outdated'!

416
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,420
Am I modern then?

417
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Yes, you're modern.

418
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,620
Here.

419
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,500
Come on, have some fruits.

420
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,660
Here.

421
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,860
Sister.

422
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,100
I bought this especially for you.

423
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,540
The chestnut cake from Kaisiling.

424
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,060
This time,

425
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,820
you can have it all to yourself.

426
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
Let me help you, Grandaunt.

427
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,780
It's so pretty.

428
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,580
I'll open it for you.

429
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,180
Grandaunt.

430
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,500
I didn't know that you like to eat this.

431
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,420
Slowly.

432
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,100
Is it good?

433
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,980
It's so yummy.

434
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,060
You didn't know then.

435
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,860
When your granny was little,

436
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,580
she was a glutton.

437
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,940
Back then,

438
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,100
whenever our dad went to Shanghai,

439
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,860
he'd visit the Kaisiling cake shop

440
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,260
to buy a slice of chestnut cake
for each of us.

441
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,660
Well,

442
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,780
I couldn't bear to finish it then.

443
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,020
I ate half of it and kept the other half.

444
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,860
I placed it beside my pillow secretly.

445
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,580
However, I heard some noise

446
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,100
in the middle of the night.

447
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,580
I thought it was a rat.

448
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,180
Turned out that it was
your granny who was stealing it.

449
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,060
Granny.

450
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,060
We talked so much

451
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,540
until we forgot the time.

452
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,140
You can sit here.

453
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,900
I'll go make dinner.

454
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,820
Grandaunt.

455
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,180
I'll go with you.

456
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,340
Never mind.

457
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,940
I've prepared everything.

458
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,500
Are you going to cook
the stuffed tofu soup with vermicelli?

459
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,180
You granny called me before she came.

460
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,700
She has ordered the dish.

461
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:58,900
Grandaunt.

462
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,900
Can I learn the recipe from you then?

463
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,820
Do you want to learn it?

464
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,260
Well,

465
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,340
after I master the recipe,

466
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,620
I can cook it for Granny every day.

467
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,900
Granny really likes it.

468
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,700
You're such a good boy.

469
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,260
Come on.

470
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,740
I'll teach you.

471
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,060
Okay, let's go.

472
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,500
- Excuse me.
- Sister.

473
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,220
Thank you, then.

474
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,900
He's a real gem.

475
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,650
[The World Can Be Better]

476
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,500
I've read your proposal.

477
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,260
Some minor amendments are needed.

478
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,940
I'm not free to travel to your place now

479
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,580
as I need to settle some family matters.

480
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,980
Is your wife still fighting with you?

481
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,700
Xizhou.

482
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,620
You mustn't divorce

483
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,660
at this critical moment.

484
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,500
After I handle the case,

485
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,820
I'll return to the country.

486
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,740
I'll talk to you then.

487
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,020
Sure.

488
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,180
Thank you for coming to my art exhibition.

489
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,740
I'm really happy to see you.

490
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,740
I'm late for two days.

491
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,900
I should have come during the opening.

492
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:14,980
It's all right.

493
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,300
Come on, let's talk inside.

494
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:16,900
Okay.

495
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,500
Daniel.

496
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,220
How dare you.

497
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,860
I invited you thrice

498
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,380
to have your art exhibition
in my art gallery.

499
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,340
Yet, you rejected me.

500
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,300
Now, you're working
with another art gallery,

501
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,740
and you still dare invite me over.

502
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,460
Well,

503
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,260
let's work together next time.

504
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,780
Mark your words.

505
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,980
I've recorded it.

506
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:03,580
Come on.

507
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,100
I wish you a successful exhibition.

508
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:05,660
Thank you.

509
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,100
How long will you be in Shanghai?

510
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,340
Five days.

511
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,740
That's short.

512
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,420
I thought of bringing you around Shanghai.

513
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,060
What a pity.

514
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,660
Once the exhibition is over,

515
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,780
I'll take a flight to Country M.

516
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,150
[.]

517
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,580
It's okay.

518
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,380
You can take the call.

519
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,220
Please excuse me.

520
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,660
Hello.

521
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,420
Have you decided on the time?

522
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,900
Not yet.

523
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,500
Let me know when the time is confirmed.

524
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,300
Hold on.

525
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,500
Is there anything else?

526
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,300
You left your lipstick at home.

527
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,060
Remember to pick it up.

528
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,060
I don't want it anymore.

529
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,860
Just throw it away.

530
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,940
How about this? Give me your address.

531
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,420
I'll bring it over to you.

532
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,820
I said, I don't want it.

533
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,740
No.

534
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,900
The lipstick looks expensive.

535
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,860
It's yours now.

536
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,540
Well...

537
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,780
She doesn't want you either.

538
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:57,900
Hello, sir.

539
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,380
This is a parcel for Gu Ruanruan.

540
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,460
Please sign the delivery note.

541
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,420
Write your name here.

542
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,020
Okay, thank you.

543
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,500
Have a nice day.

544
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,100
Are you going to Country M to take photos?

545
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,460
I'm going to film a documentary.

546
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,740
Actually, I'm influenced by you.

547
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,020
Me?

548
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:32,740
That's right.

549
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,900
I really like

550
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,620
the exhibition series
about the children of Country M

551
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,020
that you did.

552
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,060
Thank you.

553
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,380
Are you interested in a collaboration?

554
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,650
[.]

555
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:49,940
I think...

556
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,820
Cut it out, Fu Xizhou.

557
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,300
I didn't mean to bother you.

558
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,860
You got a parcel here.

559
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,220
I'll get it later.

560
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,300
No.

561
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,820
It's an urgent dispatch.

562
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,420
You'd better come back now.

563
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,540
Throw it away.

564
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,270
Hello?

565
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,900
I'm sorry.

566
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,580
Can I have a look at your proposal first?

567
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,140
I can see that you rather like the wine.

568
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,580
The texture is nice.

569
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,940
I've been treasuring this wine
for a long time.

570
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,260
It's hard to find this in the market now.

571
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,060
I still have a few bottles at home.

572
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,220
I'll ask them to send you one after this.

573
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,700
Thank you.

574
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,020
Shuning.

575
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,380
I heard from my husband.

576
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,940
Chairman Fu is calling for a board meeting

577
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,220
to decide
whether you should stay or leave.

578
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,460
You came to me for this, right?

579
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,900
I've been holding the position
for more than a decade.

580
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,380
This is not the first time
I have encountered this.

581
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,060
There's nothing to worry about.

582
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,100
I'm here

583
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,020
for our children.

584
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,460
I think we shall call it quits.

585
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,100
Your son has a girlfriend now.

586
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,660
I heard that he brought her back
to see Chairman Fu.

587
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,380
As long as I don't give them my consent,

588
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,460
they can't get married.

589
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,540
If your words matter,

590
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,900
Yunshen would have married Zhizhi now.

591
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,140
Are you going

592
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,380
to force him into a marriage then?

593
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,420
I won't force Yunshen.

594
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,300
If this doesn't work,

595
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,740
I'll change my tactic.

596
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,420
What do you mean?

597
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,260
Her granny is sick

598
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,700
and needs a liver transplant.

599
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,900
She's desperately looking
for a liver transplant.

600
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,180
If I find it for her,

601
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,020
the break-up gift

602
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,980
would be a weighty one, wouldn't it?

603
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,860
All the best to you.

604
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,540
No, all the best to us.

605
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,740
It's been a while
since Granny has been so happy.

606
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,340
That's right.

607
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,860
Her appetite has improved a lot too.

608
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,380
I wish we could stay here longer with her.

609
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,820
After Granny recovers,

610
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,140
let's come back again with her.

611
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,420
Okay.

612
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,260
When I was little,

613
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,660
Granny would bring me here every year.

614
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,980
This field.

615
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,660
She'd teach me about the crops,

616
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,660
the insects,

617
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,420
and the stars in the sky.

618
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,420
The sky is so breathtaking here.

619
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,020
It looks exactly like when I was little.

620
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,700
Yunshen.

621
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,620
I have a question.

622
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,100
What is it?

623
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,300
Have a guess.

624
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,820
When did I fall in love with you?

625
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,140
When would it be?

626
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,940
I need to think about it.

627
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,060
You must have fallen in love
with me at first sight.

628
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,580
You're such a narcissist.

629
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,300
When we were at the hunting cave.

630
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,940
You told me

631
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,820
that our deceased loved ones

632
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,140
will turn into the stars in the sky

633
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,340
and protect their loved ones.

634
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,500
Granny told me the same thing too.

635
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,060
Back then, I suddenly felt

636
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,740
that death was not that scary after all.

637
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,020
Zhu Jiu.

638
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,180
Your granny is the best one in the world.

639
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:51,980
Yes.

640
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,540

642
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,860
She's my friend

643
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,100
and my teacher.

644
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,340
Little sister.

645

The young ones aren't around.

646
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,300

648
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,060
Why do you look so skinny?

649
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,180
Don't worry, Sister.

650
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:21,900
Okay.

651
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,540
My liver isn't functioning well.

652
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,060
I had a check-up.

653
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,060
I was diagnosed with liver cancer.

654
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,700
- Calm down.
- Liver cancer? You...

655
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,980
Calm down, Sister.

656
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,940
Don't worry.

657
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,820
What do you need to do to cure it?

658
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,500
Zhu Jiu said

659
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:47,940
that she

660
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,620
would do a liver transplant for me.

661

Zhu Jiu is with me.

662
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,820
She'll find a way.

663
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,540
That would be a big surgery.

664
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,300
I know.

665
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,020
I can't help but be worried.

Don't you worry.

669
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,460
