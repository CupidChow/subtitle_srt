00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,540
I have a favor

197
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,700
to ask.

198
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,820
What are you up to again?

199
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,340
I plan to go to Country M.

200
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,260
I doubt Grandpa would let you go.

201
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,500
And your mom, too.

202
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,140
What about you? Do you agree?

203
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,620
Can't you send someone else there?

204
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,180
Xizhou.

205
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,420
Who should I send?

206
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,180
It's so boring staying in Shanghai.

207
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,460
If I can go there,

208
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,300
no one will force me
to attend the meeting.

209
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,860
Is this how you avoid the meetings?

210
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,780
I'm just kidding.

211
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,460

Actually, I want to go to Country M

214
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,060
to look for a plant named Perdo.

215
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,580
You can't go.

216
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,900
It's not stable there.

217
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,780
I can't let you go there alone.

218
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,780
I have Chen Le.

219
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,540

221
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,020
You've changed.

222
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,740
You've become indecisive.

223
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,380
You used to be fearless.

224
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,540
Show me your courage. Come on.

225
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,740
I used to look up to you.

226
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,860
Why have you changed?

227
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,780
As your little brother,

228
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,060
I'm so upset.

229
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,620
Scratch that.

230
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,380
Don't give me that.

231
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,380
Fine.

232
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,460
How about this?

233
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,300
Our company is working on a collaboration
with the local government.

234
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,740
I'll have the person in charge
to receive you there.

235
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,820
The thing is, you must

236
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,140
report your whereabouts
to me punctually every day.

237
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,340
Gosh, Xizhou.

238
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,140
I can report that to you,

239
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,140
but there's no need to receive me.

240
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,500
It's troublesome.

241
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,700
If you were to do that,

242
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,580
I'd rather work my guts out in the lab,

243
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,540
instead of such formalities.

244
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,580
Dear brother, please.

245
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,380
Enough. Please.

246
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,820
Stop talking to me like that.

247
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,660
Here's the thing.

248
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,700
I'll give you the contact.

But Grandpa...

255
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,220
Leave it to me.

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,940
Enough said, and eat the food.

Go and check on it.

00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,100
Ms. Tao, I'm playing with Wutong.

263
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,900
I'll check it later.

264
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,580
Thank you.

265
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,380
All right.

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,140
Come here.

00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,780
Hey, Wutong.

268
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,860
I asked you not to go.

269

And yet you cross me.

270
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,660
I'm talking to you.

271
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,500
There are many people in the R&D lab.

Can't you just send someone else?

00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,220
Take a seat.

275
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,220
You'll get tired from standing.

276
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,940
That place is too dangerous.

277
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,340
The living conditions
and sanitation are terrible.

278
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,900
It's too bad if you get sick there.

Don't worry, Mom.

281
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,900
I've checked the place.

282
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,820
It's safe.

283
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,220
Besides, Xizhou has already reached out

284
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,460
to the local government.

285
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,020

Mom, hold your horse.

294
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,660
I know what you're going to say.

295
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,140
What do you know?

296
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,620
It's you who obtained this project.

297
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,500
Lucky him.

298
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,260
Simply by paying lip service
in the meeting,

299
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,820

300
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,980
Listen.

301
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,260

If you keep rambling on this,

308
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,100

00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,740
under four nurses' charge.

571
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,620
It was your parents and my shared dream

572
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,540
to establish this clinic.

573
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,780
It's a shame

574
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,140
that they can see this now.

575
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,740
By the way, Mint,

576
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,420
you're heading to the border this time.

577
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,420
The situation over there
has been unstable these years.

578
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,260
It's not safe to travel alone.

579
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,300
I'm nervous about you.

580
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,580
A friend of mine is going there, too.

581
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,820
You two can team up

582
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,420
and look out for each other on the way.

583
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,540
Sure.

584
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,300
Professor Hans.

585
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,740
Mr. Fu.

586
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,580
I can go by myself.

587
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,820
It can be quite a nuisance
to travel with others.

588
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,780
What do you mean?

589
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,500
Stop it.

590
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,820
Mint.

591
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,180
The local situation is unstable.

592
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,020
Even men should have partners
to travel along with.

593
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,900
I'm really concerned
about you going alone.

594
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,340
It's not about gender.

595
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,700
Plus, you can't drive.

596
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,860
I'll hire a driver.

597
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,260
The clinic only has a limited budget.

598
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,060
What's with that scoff?

599
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,500
Yes, the problem isn't about gender.

600
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,900
It's up top. Here.

601
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,740
But it's fine.

602
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,340
I'm generous enough

603
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,460
to give you a ride.

604
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,380
Like I care.

605
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,700
No one keeps you, though.

606
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,500
You may leave.

607
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,100
Mint.

608
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,300
Come with me.

609
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,850
[Mint]

610
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:16,780
Boss.

611
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,500
Boss.

612
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,380
Do you think the lady we'll travel with

613
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,060
is pretty?

614
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,180
Pretty?

615
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,380
She's annoying.

616
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,060
Are you saying

617
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,700
that we're not taking her?

618
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,700
That'd be best.

619
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,700
She insists on going even when she can't drive.

620
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,220
That's impossible.

621
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,060
Besides,

622
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,180
Professor Hans has made the request.

623
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,460
We must take her with us.

624
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,460
In over her head.

625
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,060
No.

626
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,580
That's what we call an independent woman.

627
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,300
Well, independent women

628
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,460
also need to be practical

629
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,700
and not do something out of their depth.

630
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,340
Right?

631
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,300
Anyway, it's good
to have a doctor with us.

632
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,620
Should I hire a nanny for you?

633
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,300
No, no.

634
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,460
I'll leave you to your plants.

635
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,740
I'm going to pack things.

636
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,580
Mr. Fu and I have been friends for years,

637
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,860
and he's been providing medicine supplies
for the clinic.

638
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,620
I believe in his personality.

639
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,060
On top of that,

640
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,500
I've introduced to him a tour guide,

641
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,620
who's a local expert.

642
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,660
This is very helpful for your research.

643
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,700
Mint.

644
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,620
I must ensure your safety.

645
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,580
If you insist on going alone,

646
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,660
I'll have to consider
finding someone else.

647
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,500
All right, Uncle Hans.

648
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,300
I know what my mission is here.

649
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,180
Very well.

650
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,620
Bring two boxes of medicine
to the aid station

651
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,300
when you go over there.

652
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:02,770
Okay.

653
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,210
Good morning, Le.

654
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:25,930
Good morning, Dr. Zhu.

655
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,730
Did you sleep well?

656
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,900
Yes.

657
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,380
How about you?

658
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,260
I had a good night

659
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,020
after taking the medicine you gave me.

660
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,620
Thank you.

661
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,420
Glad to hear that.

662
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,060
Let me carry them.

663
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,580
You can rest.

664
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,580
You have quite a lot of luggage.

665
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,620
It's not like you're going on a trip.

666
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,060
They're not.

667
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,300
One is for Boss's equipment

668
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,300
and one for his clothes.

669
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,100
And my luggage too.

670
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,140
Why does a man bring so many clothes?

671
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,020
He cares about appearance that much?

672
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,900
Who are you talking about?

673
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,700
You.

674
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,300
Fine.

675
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,460
I'll let you slide.

676
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,660
Great people are bound
to have jealous ones.

677
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,900
I'm not a man.

678
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,060
Why am I jealous of you?

679
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,940
Are you not?

680
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,020
Boss.

681
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,020
You know what,

682
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,100
the environment here is great.

683
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:00,980
The air

684
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,060
is fresh.

685
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,420
Most importantly,

686
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,260
there must be a lot of yummy food here.

687
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,140
You must be hungry, right?

688
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,860
I have chocolate bars, Boss.

689
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,380
It can make you happy.

690
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,340
Dr. Zhu.

691
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,620
No, thanks.

692
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,660
How about a banana?

693
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,780
It tastes sweet.

694
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,500
Boss?

695
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,380
Dr. Zhu?

696
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,100
Sure.

697
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,380
Chen Le.

698
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,940
You can't eat bananas recently.

699
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,540
You'll get the runs.

700
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,780
No, I don't.

701
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,660
I prepare this for you.

702
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:37,900
Dr. Zhu.

703
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,460
Why would a young lady like you

704
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,860
come to this mountainous area
to do research?

705
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,980
That's impressive.

706
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,620
I'm impressed by you.

707
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:45,780
Dr. Zhu.

708
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,220
How old are you?

709
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,820
- I...
- Focused on the road, will you?

710
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,660
What's wrong with the car?

711
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,500
I can't start the engine.

712
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,220
Sit in the car. I'll go down and check it.

713
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,060
Nothing's wrong with this.

714
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,940
Not this, either.

715
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,420
Try this.

716
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,780
Are you all right?

717
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,420
