132
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,340
I will go back as soon as I can.
Don't worry.

133
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,540
You must be tired from the long flight.

134
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,500
Go and get some rest.

135
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,180
As soon as you can?

136
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,820
When exactly would that be?

137
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,140
Didn't you say you could

139
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,180
Still, I have to follow
the doctor's instructions.

140
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
It also depends on my recovery progress.

Am I right?

142
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,020

He was robbed.

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,740
I want the truth.

For what?

164
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,860
I heard from Zhizhi

165
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,660
that as Yunshen's house doctor,

166
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,140
you have been diligently

167
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,660
taking good care of him.

168
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,300
So as Yunshen's mother,

169
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,300
I must certainly express my gratitude.

170
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,140
Don't mention it, Mrs. Fu.

171
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,540
Whether as Yunshen's house doctor

172
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,460
or his girlfriend,

173
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,420
that is my duty.

174
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,140
This is your pay and bonus.

175
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,420
This is too much.

176
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,180
Consider the extra

177
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,660
a gesture of appreciation from me
as his mother.

178
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,340
Alright.

179
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,740
Thank you, Mrs. Fu.

180
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,140
I didn't expect you to be so frank.

181
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,060
In that case, I'm relieved.

182
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,820
Yunshen no longer needs a house doctor.

183
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,380
So it's not that appropriate for you
to stay here.

184
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,820
I have asked Linda

185
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,340
to pack your things.

186
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:45,780
Sure.

187
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,740
Mrs. Fu,

188
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,980
I should get going then.

189
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,380
(Working overtime tonight?)

190
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,580
[Yunshen]
(Focus on your work.)

191
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,660
(No need to reply.)

192
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,180
(I'm going to sleep now.)

193
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,860
(See you tomorrow.)

194
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,860
Mint.

195
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,260
You're early today.

196
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,020
I brought you breakfast.

197
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,980
I'm skipping breakfast, Dr. Ji.

198
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,060
I need to head out

199
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,220
for some business.

200
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,900
Come in.

201
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,180
We can really read each other's minds.

202
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,620
I was about to send you a message.

203
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,420
Why?

204
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,660
You don't look so well.

205
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,900
Come closer.

206
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,300
You don't have a fever.

207
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,540
Did you skip breakfast?

208
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,180
I've had my breakfast.

209
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,060
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,220
Why are you apologizing to me?

211
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,940
Still blaming yourself?

212
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,060
It's not because of that.

213
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,620
I wasn't working a night shift
last night.

214
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,620
Then why didn't you

215
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,780
reply to my message?

216
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,180
Your mother talked to me last night.

217
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
She gave me my pay and bonus.

218
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,420
So...

219
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,980
Did she give you a hard time?

220
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,340
She didn't.

221
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,700
She thanked me for taking care of you.

222
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,980
She paid me quite a lot.

223
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,340
What's wrong?

224
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,300
Your hand.

225
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,820
Dr. Zhu.

226
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,980
You're not leaving me

227
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,820
for this money, are you?

228
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,860
That money-grubber mind of yours
is good at weighing profits.

229
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,740
So make sure you weigh this carefully.

230
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,220
I am worth

231
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,420
thousands of times more

232
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,980
than the money in this envelope.

233
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,860
Relax.

234
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,860
I've thought long about it last night.

235
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,500
The envelope versus Fu Yunshen.

236
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,140
Congratulations.

237
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,060
You have won.

238
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,500
Thank you, Zhu Jiu.

239
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,380
No need to thank me.

240
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,380
But

241
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,220
I was honestly a bit angry.

242
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,420
She is your mother.

243
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,500
So I can't argue with her.

244
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,380
But I felt a bit aggrieved.

245
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,700
Then you should have told me.

246
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,380
That's what I am doing now.

247
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,260
It's my first time
encountering such a thing.

248
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,220
I didn't know how to tell you.

249
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,900
I felt really frustrated
and had mixed feelings.

250
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,580
Even more than performing a surgery.

251
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,540
I also didn't quite understand.

252
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,420
Why is your mother so eager to reject me

253
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,180
when she doesn't even know me at all?

254
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,460
But I sort of get it too.

255
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,020
Perhaps every mother

256
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,700
has high expectations

257
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,540
for their child's marriage.

258
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,820
And I'm not someone she likes.

259
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,780
But you are the one I like.

260
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:30,820
That's right.

261
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,380
That's why I have decided to work hard

262
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,180
and make your mother accept me.

263
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,940
Thank you, Zhu Jiu.

264
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,740
Thank you, too,

265
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,700
for letting me face this love
with courage.

266
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,260
You have grown up and become mature now.

267
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,900
Besides courage,

268
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,980
what else do you have?

269
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Besides having courage,
I think I also...

270
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,260
Have a bit of a temper.

271
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,380
What's wrong?

272
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,140
Feeling crook?

273
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,540
It hurts here.

274
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,940
Here?

275
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:18,900
Yes.

276
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,220
Here, too.

277
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,140
What?

278
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,260
My whole body is aching.

279
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,380
Touch here.

280
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,220
Why are you hurting here?

281
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,860
Now it doesn't hurt anymore.

282
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,740
Hello, Dr. Zhu.

283
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,700
Mrs. Fu.

284
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,740
Good morning.

285
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,500
Dr. Zhu.

286
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,660
Did you go to see Yunshen?

287
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Yes, just now.

288
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,300
By the way,

289
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,260
I have passed the envelope
you gave me yesterday

290
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,300
to Yunshen.

291
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,340
Dr. Zhu.

292
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,580
I didn't expect you to be two-faced.

293
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,380
It's not like that.

294
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,700
I just felt

295
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,220
that this concerns the two of us.

296
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,780
Yunshen has the right to know.

297
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,620
Besides, when you spoke to me yesterday,

298
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,860
I did cower for a second.

299
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,340
But when I thought of leaving Yunshen,

300
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,980
I was devastated.

301
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,820
I'm sure Yunshen feels the same.

302
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,620
That's just what you think.

303
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,940
Yunshen wouldn't think so.

304
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,300
Mrs. Fu.

305
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,340
I know you don't like me,

306
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,100
but I hope you can give me a chance.

307
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,100
Not a chance.

308
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,340
I wouldn't like someone

309
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,580
who causes harm to my son.

310
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,620
He was already well enough

311
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,580
to go home.

312
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,980
But because of you,

313
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,620
he's keeping things from me.

314
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,220
I'm sorry.

315
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,740
Dr. Zhu.

316
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,020
If you still have an ounce of guilt,

317
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,180
please leave him.

318
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,460
About that,

319
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,540
all I can say is that I am sorry.

320
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,460
Dr. Zhu.

321
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,100
I have to get back to work.

322
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,100
Goodbye, Mrs. Fu.

323
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,460
I'll get you another bowl.

324
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,100
It's fine, Mom.

325
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,700
I'm full.

326
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,780
Mom.

327
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,180
Keep the money.

328
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,660
When Zhu Jiu

329
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,860
makes a formal visit
to our house later on,

330
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,860
you can give her a big red envelope.

331
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,580
Yunshen.

332
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,940
I don't like her.

333
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,300
Mom.

334
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,300
Zhu Jiu is my girlfriend.

335
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,660
She is also my future wife.

336
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,740
Even if you don't like her,

337
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,860
I hope you can respect her

338
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,860
and respect me.

339
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,940
That's nonsense.

340
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,820
Marriage isn't a child's play.

341
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,860
I'm against it.

342
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,940
I'm not kidding with you.

343
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,060
If it weren't for Zhu Jiu,

344
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,980
I would still be in a wheelchair.

345
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,300
I am grateful to her for that.

346
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,660
But she isn't the right person
to marry you.

347
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,620
I know very well

348
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,180
who is the right person for me.

349
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:44,900
Mom.

350
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,980
You can stop matching me up with Zhizhi.

351
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,020
Yunshen.

352
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,460
You've left the company for a long time.

353
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,220
A lot has happened.

354
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,820
You really need
the Zhou family's support right now.

355
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,300
I just want to do research.

356
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,700
I don't have to go back to Shanghai.

357
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,020
Leo has offered me many times.

358
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,460
What does that mean?

359
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,540
Are you threatening me?

360
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,300
Mom.

361
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,180
I'm not threatening you.

362
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,540
I just

363
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,940
hope that for once,

364
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,980
you can think about it

365
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,860
by putting yourself in my place.

366
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,500
Fine.

367
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,780
Let's not talk about this today.

368
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,540
Okay?

369
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,460
Focus on recuperating first.

370
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,620
We'll discuss this later.

371
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
I'll get you

372
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,580
another bowl of porridge.

373
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,340
Okay.

374
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,820
Mom.

375
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,060
Let me see you off at the airport.

376
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,740
You really don't have to.

377
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,180
Rest at home.

378
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,060
Don't get tired out.

379
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,780
You've said that a hundred times.

380
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,660
What?

381
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,460
Do you find me annoying now?

382
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,380
Of course not.

383
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,460
Alright. You can see me off here.

384
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,660
Recover well.

385
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,900
Come back to Shanghai soon.

386
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,740
I'll be waiting for you at home.

387
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,700
Have a safe flight.

388
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,660
Take good care of yourself.

389
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,060
Bye.

390
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,540
Be careful.

391
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,140
All indicators are good.

392
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,420
That's great.

393
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,740
Please contact me anytime

394
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,460
if something is wrong.

395
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,380
Okay.

396
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,060
Okay. Thank you.

397
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,020
Okay.

398
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,580
Mr. Fu.

399
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,700
How about going on a date

400
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,500
to celebrate your recovery?

401
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,140
Sure.

402
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,580
Anything in mind?

403
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,740
Well, let me think about it.

404
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,300
Take your time.

405
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,780
I'll do whatever you want with you.

406
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,180
Wutong.

407
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,380
He's leaving soon.

408
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,180
Look at me.

409
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,220
Take a good look at me.

410
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,420
I am your one and only mistress.

411
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,140
If other women approach him,

412
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,620
you must bite her. You hear me?

413
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:42,940
Bite her!

414
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,940
Have you gone mad?

415
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,220
Who are you biting?

416
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,060
You.

417
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,500
Why?

418
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,460
Looking for your shoes?

419
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,380
Come here.

420
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,340
Am I heavy?

421
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,460
Yes, quite so.

422
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,180
Aren't you leaving soon?

423
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,380
Have you packed your luggage?

424
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,460
When can I take you with me?

425
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,580
Do you know that I'm a prohibited item?

426
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,940
If you're considered prohibited,
then I must be inflammable.

427
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,700
You don't say.

428
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,700
When we first met,

429
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,700
you even refused to check in my luggage.

430
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,740
That is why

431
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,340
I have you now.

432
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,460
That's smart.

433
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,940
I'm not just smart.

434
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,780
What are you doing?

435
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,060
Don't you have to leave?

436
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,940
I want to pack you into my bag.

437
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,900
Come on!

438
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,220
Disco!

439
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,020
You're in trouble!

440
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,220
Help!

441
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,300
Gosh!

442
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,980
Your hair is in a mess.

443
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,180
Fu Yunshen.

444
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,660
When you get to Shanghai,

445
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,540
don't you flirt around. You hear me?

446
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,220
No.

447
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,860
Just kidding. I hear you.

448
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,380
I only love one type of plant

449
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,540
my whole life.

450
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,860
That is mint.

451
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,100
Got it, Mom.

452
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,380
Alright?

453
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,460
- Look, it's your grandpa.
- Yunshen.

454
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,100
You're back.

455
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,420
Grandpa!

456
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,460
You rascal.

457
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,500
Are your legs okay?

458
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,660
See? I told you.

459
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,500
I'm fine. Look. I'm alright now.

460
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,860
Rascal.

461
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,220
You're quite sturdy.

462
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,420
You're not too bad too.

463
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,460
Go pack your things.

464
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,020
I've cooked your favorite dishes.

465
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,660
I'm stewing the soup.

466
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,220
Oh dear!

467
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,340
What kind of soup?

468
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,140
Yunshen, welcome back.

469
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,060
Miss Tao.

470
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,700
You're getting younger.

471
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,460
And you look great.

472
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,340
You're still a sweet talker.

473
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,020
Hey, my son!

474
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,900
You don't recognize me anymore?

475
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,580
Yunshen.

476
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,740
Come give me a hand.

477
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,420
Come on.

478
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,860
I'll be right with you, Grandpa.

479
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,540
Great.

480
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,340
Mom.

481
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,300
Where's my brother?

482
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,740
Stop calling him your brother.

483
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,740
He didn't even

484
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,100
give you a call
knowing that you're back.

485
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,260
Listen.

486
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,060
Fu Xizhou

487
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,660
- is flaunting his power.
- Mom.

488
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,100
Really.

489
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,780
He must be held up at the office.

490
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,020
Why do you care about that?

491
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,900
Are we really eating Grandpa's cooking?

492
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,300
Let's order takeout

493
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,220
just in case.

494
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,020
Don't embarrass your grandpa like that.

495
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,860
You know.

496
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,260
I bought a counterfeit last time.

497
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,980
Hello, Mr. Fu Jr.

498
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,900
Hello, Mr. Fu Jr.

499
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,340
Hello, Mr. Fu.

500
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,260
- Mr. Fu.
- Xizhou.

501
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,660
You're back.

502
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,140
Let's have lunch together.

503
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,700
You didn't come last night.

504
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,420
I already have lunch plans.

505
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,060
Dinner tonight, then.

506
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,900
I'm not free tonight.

507
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,740
There's been a lot of work to do.

508
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,940
You can go ahead first.

509
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,180
I need to get something from the car.

510
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:21,940
Mr. Fu Jr.

511
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,740
The elevator is here.

512
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,940
Are you taking it with us?

513
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,060
Go ahead without me.

514
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,060
Alright.

515
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,100
(Please enjoy.)

516
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,060
Thank you.

517
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,020
Professor Hans can finally be at ease

518
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,940
now that you can take over the clinic.

519
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,700
Of course.

520
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:46,980
I am known as

521
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,500
an understanding man and a timely rain.

522
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,500
Yes, you are.

523
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,300
You're like
a sweet and thoughtful honey.

524
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,100
On a serious note,

525
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,060
we have been fighting Danmin Disease

526
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,060
for so long.

527
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,940
At last, I can visit the place
to find out.

528
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,980
May you have a safe trip tomorrow.

529
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,180
- Come.
- Let's do it.

530
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,180
Safe journey!

531
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:08,780
Cheers!

532
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,380
Eat up.

533
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:18,900
Here.

534
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,100
It's for you.

535
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,580
You got me a gift?

536
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,700
Open it.

537
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,580
It's sunscreen, right?

538
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,060
Why? You don't like it?

539
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,740
You're going to need it.

540
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,100
Did you know

541
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,340
that the UV rays in Country M
is very strong?

542
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,860
Make sure you use it.

543
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,100
Look at your skin tone.

544
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,100
He mustn't get any tanner.

545
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,500
What do you know?

546
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,420
This is masculinity.

547
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,820
Bronze skin tone looks amazing.

548
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,900
Indeed.

549
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,620
Zhu Jiu.

550
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,540
This is for you.

551
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,940
I have a gift too?

552
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,780
Thank you, Dr. Ji.

553
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,060
It looks pretty.

554
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
It's here.

555
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,380
Ji Silang.

556
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,980
This is discrimination.

557
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,500
It's beautiful.

558
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,300
Thank you, Dr. Ji.

559
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,620
I'm glad you like it.

560
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,540
Dig in.

561
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,020
Okay.

562
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,540
Eat up.

563
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,060
Boss!

564
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,020
Welcome!

565
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,340
A big welcome to you!

566
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,660
Welcome!

567
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,020
A big welcome to you!

568
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,580
Boss.

569
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,420
We have been longing for your return.

570
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,740
You're finally back.

571
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,140
You were just longing for a bonuses.

572
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,540
How could you say that, Boss?

573
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,100
Don't talk about money and bonus
with me.

574
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,420
Let me take a good look.

575
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,620
That's enough.

576

Get back to work, everyone.

577
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,860
Go on. Get back to work.

578
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,060
I still have something important
to tell Boss.

579
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,380
Come here.

580
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,460
I'm right here.

581
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,220
I asked you

582
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,780
to check the details

583
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,260

584
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,100

585
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,180

592
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,980

606
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,340
[MC Innovative Medicine Special Fund]

607
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,740
This charity specializes in funding

608
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,500
non-profit researches and developments.

609
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,340
Immune system diseases

610
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,300
are covered by their funding.

611
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,420
So?

612
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,020
Since the Perdo Project
is not making progress,

613
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,460
how about giving me the right
to develop it?

614
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,540
I can apply for a professional fund

615
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,700
and do my own R&D.

616
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,380
It won't cause any trouble
for the company.

617
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,100
Are you resigning from Lingtian?

618
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,060
What does that mean?

619
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,020
As long as you're working at Lingtian,

620
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,740
you are Lingtian's manpower.

622
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
Can you not be like this?

623
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,020
I'm sure you know better than me

624
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,780
the importance of Perdo to the company.

625
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,100
Everything else is negotiable.

626
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,540
But selling the rights to the plant

627
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,380
is off the table.

628
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,380
The company
was having a financial crisis

629
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,020
and needed a new project urgently
to turn things around.

630
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
But the situation

631
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,900
has become very stable now.

632
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,500
And this project

633
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,900
won't have a big impact on the company.

634
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,180
But to those sick children,

635
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,340
Perdo is their hope for survival.

636
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,660
I think we should stop repeating

637
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
the things

638
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,780
that already have conclusions.

639
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,700
It's not up to me.

640
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,940
The shareholders must approve it.

641
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,980
I know that.

642
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,660
But Grandpa handed over
this project to you.

643
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,300
So I must seek your approval too.

644
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,300
I'm saying this one last time.

645
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,540
It's not up to me.

646
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,300
When you get to Shanghai,

647
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,700
you must take care of yourself.

648
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,900
It snows a lot very often here.

649
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:41,820
Watch out.

650
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,740
What about Shanghai?

651
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,060
Does it snow a lot too?

652
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,220

653
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,220

654

But it gets melted the next day.

What's the season in Shanghai now?

656
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,820
It's probably late autumn.

657

What about the osmanthus flowers?

658
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,820
Which month do they bloom?

660
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,380

it's around June and July.
