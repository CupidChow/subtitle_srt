00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,940
Nonsense!

190
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,260
Dad.

191
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,580
I made the decision after much thought.

192
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,980
Just because he wasn't at the church?

193
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,380
Such a huge issue happened
at the company that day.

194
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,940
How could he possibly leave?

195
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,300
Ruanruan,

196
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,260
some things
are just a matter of formality.

197
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,220
Next year, I'll have Xizhou

198
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,820
give you another wedding.

199
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,340
If this will get you to drop the idea,

200
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,540
I'll pay for a grand wedding.

201
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,140
What do you think?

202
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,860
Dad.

203
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,100
It's not about the ceremony.

204
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,100
Then, what is it about?

205
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,820
Our personalities aren't compatible.

206
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,460
You've known him for so many years.

207
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,380
How can you not know his personality?

208
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,300
Dad.

209
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,380
Sometimes, you can only learn
about a person

210
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,100
once you get close to him.

211
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,700
I tried.

212
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,060
I did my best.

213
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,140
I object.

214
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,340
If you get a divorce,

215
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,340
I'll be the laughingstock!

216
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,980
What are you saying?

217
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,260
Ruanruan,

218
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,340
tell us

219
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,140
what happened.

220
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,380
Ruanruan,

221
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,300
I just want to know this.

222
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,300
Have you thought about this seriously?

223
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,340
You won't regret it?

224
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,540
Okay.

225
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
What do you mean by that?

226
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,540
Enough!

227
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,580
Let our daughter decide her own marriage!

228
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,940
You're defending her?

229
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,060
Hasn't she made enough decisions?

230
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,340
You're the one who spoiled her rotten!

231
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,300
I objected to this marriage
from the very beginning.

232
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,340
You're the one who said
you were a good judge of character, no?

233
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,980
And look what happened.

234
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,180
If our daughter hadn't suffered terribly,

235
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,540
would she willingly get a divorce?

236
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,580
You women are too soft-hearted.

237
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,300
You don't care about the bigger picture.

238
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,660
And I think you care too much
about your pride and ego.

239
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,500
You don't care

240
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,860
about your daughter's happiness at all!

241
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,100
She wanted to marry him!

242
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,060
Mom. Dad.

243
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,740

00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,220
I made you sad.

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,340
I'm sorry

249
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,700
I made things difficult for you.

250
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,820
You're right.

251
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,660
I used to be too immature.

252
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,660
But it's time I grow up.

253
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,060
I'll take care of this myself.

This is Granny.

Say "Granny".

258

Let's get wontons.

267
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,740
Wontons? With what filling?

268
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,380
Small dried shrimp
and winter bamboo shoots.

269
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,620

Why are you here?

Don't bring anything
when you visit here next time.

Oh, I can't cook that.

380
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,460
How about this?

381
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,700
I'll buy it from the shop

382
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,980
at Zhengyi Road.

383
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,140
That place?

384
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,460
Never mind.

385
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
There's a stench in their soup.

386
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,260
Hear that?

387
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,500
Look at your granny.

388
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,020
Such a picky eater.

389
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,060
Don't blame me
for getting more cravings with age.

390

Granny,

391
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,900
I need to step out for a bit.

392
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,220
You… Slow down!

393
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,300

Meng! Meng!

395
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,180
Meng!

396
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:04,820
Calm down.

397
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,380
Meng!

398
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,260
Meng!

399
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,620
- I need the family to wait here.
- Meng!

[OR Center/Anesthesia Dept]

401
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,020
Blood pressure's dropping.

402
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,820
She's going into cardiac arrest.

403
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,700
Prepare for resuscitation.

404
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:42,940
Dr. Zhu,

her heartbeat is coming back.

406
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,180
She's finally safe.

407
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,100
Yes.

408
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,500
Dr. Zhu!

409
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,740
How is Meng?

410
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,980
Calm down.

411
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,460
She's safe for now.

412
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,220
It was an acute infection caused
by pneumonia that led to heart failure.

413
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,700
Heart failure?

414
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,100
Dr. Zhu,

415
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,580
you have to save her!

416
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,900
I haven't spent much time with Meng.

417
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,180
Please save her!

418
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,140
Dr. Zhu,

419
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,660
can you perform the surgery?

420
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,140
If it's necessary,

421
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,660
we can sell the house.

422
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,500
- If that's not enough, we can get a loan.
- That's right.

423
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,060
Meng's pneumonia is severe.

424
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,460
And she's a little malnourished.

425
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,580
I do not advise surgery.

426
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,060
Well… What can we do?

427
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,020
How about this?

428
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,460
I'll arrange for her to be hospitalized

429
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,820
and conduct a comprehensive examination.

430
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,580
We'll give her
some nutritional supplements.

When all her indicators are in order,

432
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,580
we'll consider surgery.

433
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,300
Okay.

434
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,860
We'll do as you say, Dr. Zhu.

435
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,020
Thank you, Dr. Zhu.

436
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,260
Thank you, Dr. Zhu.

00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,500

Sure.

That's all.

Congenital heart disease.

Underdeveloped left ventricle.

Reversed coronary artery abnormalities.

She is almost six years old

455
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,260
but weighs less than 20 kilograms.

456
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,740
Dr. Zhu,

457
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,180
you must know

458
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,580
what this means.

459
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,100
I am aware

460
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,980
this is a very high-risk operation.

461
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,820
But it's her only chance of survival.

462
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,620
She's too young.

463
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,220
I want to do everything I can.

464
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,060
Dr. Zhu,

465
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,900
does that mean

466
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,620
you're confident
that you can perform this surgery?

467
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,300
Doctors are not gods.

468
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,460
No one can be 100% sure.

469
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,700
Director,

470
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,500
I've seen a similar case before

471
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,220
with a newborn from Switzerland.

472
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,100
The situation was very much like Meng's.

473
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,500
The surgery went smoothly,

474
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,580
and the recovery was good.

475
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,900
I know the case you mentioned,

476
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,220
but the probability is extremely low.

477
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,700
But since there's a successful example,

478
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,300
I think we should give it a try.

479
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,820
Even if the surgery is successful,

480
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,460
who can guarantee that the child

481
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,060
can withstand the high mortality rate

482
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,540
of complications

483
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,420
and have a good quality of life afterward?

484
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,620
I've considered your concerns as well.

485
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,220
But if we don't proceed with the surgery,

486
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,820
she won't even have a chance of survival.

487
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,740
If she can't survive,
how can her quality of life be improved?

488
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,260
Director,

489
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,100
why don't we give her

490
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,020
another systematic examination,

491
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,860
conduct a consultation,

492
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,380
and then make the decision?

493
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,300
How about that?

494
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,460
Chief. Ji,

495
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,660
what is your opinion?

496
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,860
Director,

497
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,020
Dr. Zhu and I will both
be in charge of this patient.

498
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,060
What do you think?

499
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,260
You're here to meddle too?

500
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,220
Dr. Zhu made a good point.

501
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,980
We have to give her a chance, at least.

502
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,220
I will first
request an expert consultation

503
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,340
to formulate a perfect plan.

504
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,940
I believe you are both aware

505
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,620
of this child's family background.

506
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,060
It was the family
who insisted on the surgery.

507
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,300
We will explain all possible situations

508
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,580
so that they can make

509
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,220
the call.

510
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,580
Oh, you two…

511
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,780
Dr. Ji,

512
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,420
thank you.

513
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,340
For what?

514
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,660
I admire your courage.

515
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,340
It's not courage.

516
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,900
I'm the family of a patient, too.

517
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,940
I understand the desperation
of Meng's parents.

518
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,060
Even if there's only a glimmer of hope,

519
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,220
even if it means sacrificing everything,

520
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,900
I'd do everything I could
to save my loved ones.

521
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,100
What's wrong?

522
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,260
Someone in your family is sick, too?

523
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,500
My grandmother.

524
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,100
Late-stage liver cancer.

525
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,940
She's been staying in our hospital
for a while now.

526
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,260
But my liver is incompatible.

527
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,460
So we just have to wait.

528
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,460
There's nothing else I can do.

529
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,660
Why didn't you tell me about this?

530
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,260
Dr. Ji,

531
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,180
I know it's difficult
to find a liver donor.

532
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,100
I'd just make another person worry
if I told you.

533
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,620
The more people,
the higher the chances of success.

534
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,060
We have to try, at least.

535
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,620
I'll mobilize
all my networks and connections

536
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,340
to find a liver donor for her.

537
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,180
Dr. Ji,

538
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,460
thank you.

539
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,220
You can thank me

540
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
after we find a match.

541
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,180
Is there a way to treat aortic inversion?

542
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,180
This is a congenital heart defect.

543
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,580
The best treatment period
for Meng was during her infancy.

544
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,820
She's older now.

545
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,020
Congenital?

546
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,540
How could it be congenital?

547
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,180
Yes. Isn't this a genetic disease?

548
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
Neither of our families has this disease.

549
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,100
It's not just a matter of genetics.

550
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,340
There's also the possibility
of bacterial infection,

551
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,460
including improper medication

552
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,740
during pregnancy.

553
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,780
Dr. Zhu,

554
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,980
when I was pregnant with Meng,

555
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,180
one of my teeth was inflamed.

556
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,100
I didn't want it to affect my work.

557
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,260
I still had to make money.

558
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,860
So, I took anti-inflammatories
for a while.

559
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,100
What? Who let you
take anti-inflammatories?

560
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,620
Don't you know pregnant women
shouldn't take any medication?

561
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,780
No… Why did you take medication?

562
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
Mr. Meng.

563
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,780
- No, you're going to…
- Mr. Meng.

564

Until the results
of the investigation are known,

been recalled?

The test results proved
that those vaccines are normal,

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,620

591
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,780
There's a rumor that Lingtian

592

didn't recall the vaccine

593
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,860
because they're trying to cover up
for the top brass.

Such rumors

What I can promise is that,

600
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,220
not only will Lingtian do its best
to investigate the accident ourselves,

601
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,700
but we will also actively cooperate
with the watchdog organization.

604
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,700
that all of Lingtian's vaccines
are defective?

605
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,180
It's just a matter
of time and probability.

606
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,060
We have decided

607
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,740

00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,580
I called her,

751
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,460
but she refused to talk.

752
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,980
So, I figured

753
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,220
maybe it would be better
if I stayed out of her sight.

754
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,820
I wouldn't provoke her that way.

755
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,540
Then, maybe, gradually,

756
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,420
she won't be mad at me anymore.

757
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,220
If that's what you think,

758
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,660
then there aren't enough Gu Ruanruans
in this world to divorce you.

759
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,580
When your wife is upset,
you have to coax her.

760
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,500
Yes.

761
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,940
I understand, Dad.

762
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,340
I've spoiled Ruanruan.

763
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,180
She's like a child throwing a tantrum.

764
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,580
But there's one good thing about that.

765
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,780
It means she's easy to please.

766
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,180
Buy her a gift and apologize.

767
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,460
Say something nice,
and this will be over.

768
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,580
Got it, Dad.

769
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,300
Think about it.

770
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,500
Look.

771
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,380
Come here, Meng.

772
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:21,980
Come here.

773
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,700
Come, Wutong.

774
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,260
Sit.

775
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,260
This is Meng.

776
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,580
Meng, this is Wutong.

777
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,140
Isn't it cute?

778
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:29,780
Give it to me.

779
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,940
Go ahead and play with Wutong.

780
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,100
Here.

781
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,180
Go.

782
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:36,860
Let's go.

783
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,860
The weather's nice today.

784
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,140
You're worried about her.

785
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,300
Has the date
of the surgery been confirmed?

786
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,500
Not yet.

787
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,260
Her health

788
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,180
still isn't at its best yet.

789
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,780
Besides,

790
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,740
even after her parents
sold their old house

791
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,980
and Dr. Ji helped them
get a medical waiver,

792
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,220
they still don't have enough
to cover her medical expenses.

793
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,420
Surgeries like Meng's

794
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,820
are very risky and costly,

795
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,380
so many parents

796
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,500
would choose to give up.

797
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,620
But her parents didn't.

798
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,100
On the one hand, I'm glad,

799
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,900
but on the other hand…

800
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,740
It's a lot of pressure.

801
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,540
Yes.

802
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,020
The house is just something material

803
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,580
to them.

804
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,060
Their daughter matters more to them.

805
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:40,980
Yes.

806
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,580
That's why I took Meng as my patient.

807
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,500
You've made your decision.

808
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,220
So do your best!

809
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,660
You'll always have my support.

810
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,980
I'll do my best.

811
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,900
Then…

812
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,900
Do you need some encouragement?

813
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,300
Depends on what it is.

814
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,420
Madam Zhu.

815
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,900
Wutong is scared of this.

816
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,020
Wutong's scared of this?

817
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,740
That's okay.

818
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,020
The lighting is perfect.

819
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,780
Let's take a picture together.

820
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,660
Why did you misbehave, Wutong?

821
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,300
Here, good boy.

822
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,500
- Look here.
- Come on.

823
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,420
One, two, three.

824
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,660
Isn't that Fu Yunshen?

825
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,140
Who's that woman beside him?

826
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,220
She's wearing a white coat.

827
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,660
Is she from your hospital?

828
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,100
Is she a doctor, too?

829
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,340
What kind of freaks
does your hospital hire?

830
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,260
So unhygienic.

831
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,340
She's too close to that dog.

832
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,820
What's her name?

833
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,780
Which department is she from?

834
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,860
Zhou Zhizhi.

835
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,460
What's wrong with you?

836
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,740
You're just mumbling.

837
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Her name is Zhu Jiu.

838
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,860
She's from the cardiac surgery department.

839
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,380
You're a disgrace.

840
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,900
If you like him, then fight for him.

841
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,660
Play tricks that you have to.

842
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,180
Don't be so naive and gullible.

843
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,300
If not, then let go.

844
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,020
What's so good about Fu Yunshen anyway?

845
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,820
Look at his taste in women.

846
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,220
Mom.

847
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,860
Don't talk like that.

848
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,020
Zhou Zhizhi,

849
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,820
open your eyes and see what's going on!

850
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,100
You are defending him.

851
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,900
But has he ever looked your way?

852
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,020
My daughter

853
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,820
can have any excellent man she wants.

854
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,980
But you just have to fall for this one.

855
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,140
Stop it, Mom.

856
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,060
Back then,

857
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,980
I got you the best instructor

858
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,460
and went to your cello lessons
with you every day.

859
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,420
I had such high hopes for you!

860
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,580
But you?

861
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,700
You gave all of that up

862
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,060
for this man!

863
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,580
There you go again.

864
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,180
Becoming a cellist is your dream!

865
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,220
Not mine!

866
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,460
Fine.

867
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,140
You had better
give up these feelings soon.

868
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,420
The blind date this weekend
I told you to consider.

869
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,740
What are your thoughts?

870
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,260
I'm not going.

871
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,460
You don't have a say in this.

872
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,380
Don't force me, Mom.

873
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,940
You're the one that forced my hand!

874
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,340
Either way, I'm not going.

875
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:48,980
You…

876
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,260
Take this, Dr. Zhu.

877
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:02,780
No…

878
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,260
Dr. Zhu.

879
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,500
What is the meaning of this?

880
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,220
Dr. Zhu,

881
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,540
thank you.

882
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,140
You've been so kind to Meng.

883
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,220
You're treating her.

884
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,180
You even let her play with a dog.

885
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,060
She was so happy today.

886
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,300
You don't have to thank me for that.

887
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,780
I like Meng a lot, too.

888
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,100
Dr. Zhu,

889
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,340
these are some apples from our hometown.

890
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,180
They're crisp and sweet.

891
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,260
Take these.

892
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,020
You really don't have to do this…

893
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,260
We can't afford much.

894
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,820
This is just

895
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,940
a token of our appreciation.

896
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,020
As you know, we sold our old house

897
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,900
for Meng's surgery.

898
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,900
Her dad's been working
a few extra odd jobs in the meantime.

899
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,820
It's just the way her father is.

900
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,020
When he has too much to drink,

901
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,740
he just loses control of his temper.

902
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,820
Please don't take it to heart.

903
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,300
Dr. Zhu,

904
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,580
I'm counting on you to help Meng.

905
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,780
Please help her, Dr. Zhu.

906
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,620
Mrs. Meng…

907
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:00,820
How about this?

908
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,660
I'll take this apple.

909
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,180
Keep the rest.

910
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:04,820
Okay?

911
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,300
Don't worry.

912
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
We decided to accept Meng.

913
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,820
I will do everything I can to help her.

914
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,100
Thank you, Dr. Zhu.

915
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,580
- Mom…
- Rest assured.

916
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,460
Mom…

917
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,540
