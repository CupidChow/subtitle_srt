1
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,626
It has always been like that.

2
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:16,457
I always do everything I set my mind to.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,214
EPISODE 5

4
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:47,861
A WOMAN IN HER 30S
PRESUMED TO HAVE TAKEN HER OWN LIFE

5
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:53,481
LEE, A WOMAN IN HER 30S
WAS FOUND DEAD THIS MORNING

6
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:54,983
AT A PARKING LOT IN PYEONGCHANG-DONG

7
00:00:57,694 --> 00:00:59,562
You know I'm impatient, right?

8
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:00,999
Make sure you meet the deadline.

9
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:12,851
Right, Yu-mi!

10
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,994
Stay out of my sight
and use the stairs, will you?

11
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:31,313
It can't be a suicide.

12
00:01:58,304 --> 00:01:59,336
You're home.

13
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:18,709
Why didn't you show up without telling me?

14
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:22,417
I had a class.

15
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,078
I told you it's important.

16
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:27,630
I only sit there quietly like a flower.

17
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:33,670
Missing out a couple of times
won't deter anything.

18
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,315
I know you didn't have class.

19
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,657
You made me cancel a class last time

20
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:42,898
when you held an event at the museum.

21
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,305
This was the make-up class.

22
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,022
Didn't your loyal secretary tell you?

23
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:51,157
No, no. That's not the issue.

24
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,627
Your attitude is the problem.

25
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:04,353
What's with you?

26
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:08,332
You're saying the same thing you said

27
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,331
when you fired your driver, Mr. Kim.

28
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,516
Do I work under you?

29
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:28,894
Make-up class?

30
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,700
You should quit teaching.

31
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,522
I said, do I work under you?

32
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,887
I'll have Yu-mi accompany you
starting tomorrow, so go around with her.

33
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:53,449
Is she accompanying me
or is she monitoring me?

34
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,911
So you are treating me like Mr. Kim.

35
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:21,552
Yale University's yearbook?

36
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,357
You can buy things like that these days.

37
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:25,760
Where?

38
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:28,028
They have websites that sell used goods
in America too.

39
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,339
Really?

40
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:33,368
Why didn't I think of that?

41
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:35,183
People sell anything
that can make money nowadays.

42
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:38,756
No way. You're a genius.

43
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:41,800
Darn it.

44
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:44,449
What is it? What are you looking for?

45
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:46,869
The truth.

46
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:49,552
Is this a 20 questions game?

47
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:53,486
Shall we eat faster?

48
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:55,963
I think I need to do some online shopping
back at the office.

49
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:01,422
Today, the sky looks especially blue,

50
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:03,403
and the sunlight is blinding.

51
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:07,761
I left home this morning,
and on my way here,

52
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:09,561
NURI SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION'S
FOUNDING CEREMONY

53
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:12,257
...I got teary for some reason

54
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,193
and my heart was racing.

55
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:17,832
On such a beautiful day,

56
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:21,418
Nuri Scholarship Foundation

57
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,820
will mark its beginning

58
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:28,708
with all of you here in attendance today.

59
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:32,890
Thank you.

60
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:43,138
News about Candidate Lee Jung-il's house
under a borrowed name was published.

61
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:53,946
I, Choi Ji-hoon,

62
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:56,279
will not say empty words about the future.

63
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:59,275
I, Choi Ji-hoon,

64
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:03,926
am confident that I'll be innovative
in practicing conservative values.

65
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:07,676
CENTER OF CAPABILITY,
INNOVATIVE SEOUL'S CHOI JI-HOON

66
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,528
Dear admirable Seoul citizens.

67
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,270
Please join forces.

68
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:13,728
Let's win the general election

69
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:15,339
and stay in power.

70
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:18,037
I, Choi Ji-hoon, will make that happen!

71
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:29,357
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

72
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:35,305
Ms. Yoon So-jung,
you attended the same school as Lee Anna

73
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:37,395
and you're also a Korean,

74
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:39,952
so I wonder if you know anything
about her recent news.

75
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:42,437
Are you talking about Hyun-joo?

76
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,621
"Hyun-joo"?

77
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,462
She has two names.

78
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:49,491
Her Korean name is Hyun-joo,
and here, she's called Anna.

79
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:50,988
LEE ANNA EQUALS HYUN-JOO

80
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:53,825
She lived in Boston until last year,

81
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:56,062
but I heard she went back to Korea
to get a divorce.

82
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,794
I don't know what happened after.

83
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,911
I only hear about her
through other people.

84
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,581
Do you happen to know
where she's staying in Korea?

85
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:06,504
Reporter,

86
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:10,979
did you call me
because a ghost writer wrote her thesis?

87
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:15,390
"A ghost writer"?

88
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:19,662
I was hoping it would be made public.

89
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:23,653
She bought her graduation thesis
with money.

90
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,676
When it comes
to calligrapher Kim Jeong-hui,

91
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,068
this piece is often brought up
for expressing the life of Joseon scholars

92
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,030
who enjoy the dignified way of living
despite being poor.

93
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:36,319
His writing lists

94
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:38,218
what side dishes are the best,

95
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:41,347
which are tofu, cucumber,
ginger, and herbs.

96
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,505
Do they sound dignified?

97
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:43,768
Yes.

98
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:49,027
But considering the situation at the time,
it's not really agreeable.

99
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,139
You know how much effort it takes

100
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,100
to make tofu, right?

101
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,560
Tofu?

102
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,530
Yes.

103
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:00,375
If you want to eat tofu for breakfast,

104
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,151
you must wake up at 3:00 a.m.
even at the present time.

105
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:10,032
Also, cucumber has a weak taste
and has very little calories.

106
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,998
It was extravagant to eat such a vegetable

107
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:14,915
during the Joseon Dynasty.

108
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,067
Yes?

109
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:24,615
Professor Lee.

110
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:25,800
Yes?

111
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:27,124
I'm so upset.

112
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,894
About what?

113
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:31,766
The dean just informed me

114
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:34,787
that you'll be taking a break
because of the election.

115
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,312
It's rare that someone does this
in the middle of a semester,

116
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:40,909
but I was told to help you exit smoothly.

117
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:42,682
APPLICATION FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE

118
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:45,376
You just have to sign here.

119
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:48,859
Your attitude is the problem.

120
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,927
You're saying the same thing you said

121
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:54,881
when you fired your driver, Mr. Kim.

122
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,159
You should quit teaching.

123
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:09,261
LEE ANNA

124
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:12,464
Here.

125
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:17,004
You'll return after the election, right?

126
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:20,123
Yes.

127
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:31,642
"Closed for business".

128
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:33,646
Why?

129
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:53,426
-What are you doing?
-What?

130
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:57,811
I'm here to see someone.

131
00:09:57,894 --> 00:09:58,895
Who?

132
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:01,514
The owner of this place.

133
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,191
That's right. The owner.

134
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:08,054
What is it? Did I do something wrong?

135
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:11,570
The whole neighborhood is sensitive
these days.

136
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,963
They'll report anyone
they're not familiar with.

137
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,465
What? I was reported?

138
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:19,849
You don't seem to have a clue,
so you're probably not someone close.

139
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:21,761
You should just go.
You won't be able to see them anyway.

140
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:23,638
Let's go.

141
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:24,733
Wait!

142
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:28,899
I'm a reporter from Bokuk Daily.
Just a minute.

143
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,227
I'm curious about something.

144
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:35,981
Isn't it hard to travel here for work
all the way from Incheon?

145
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:38,935
A little.

146
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,813
Smile a little.

147
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:44,947
It's nice when you smile.

148
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:48,016
Gosh, it's Professor Lee.

149
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:49,095
Hello.

150
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:51,053
-Please have a lot.
-Okay.

151
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:56,212
I'll get you a studio apartment nearby.

152
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:57,172
Pardon?

153
00:10:57,676 --> 00:11:00,095
You're working for me now.

154
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:01,437
Consider it your welfare.

155
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:11,246
You don't have to do that.

156
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:14,343
It's not a lot of money to me.

157
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:17,088
I'm really okay.

158
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:18,494
It makes me uncomfortable.

159
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:22,189
Okay.

160
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,236
Do you remember Mr. Kim

161
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:36,324
who used to drive for my husband?

162
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:38,070
Yes. I know Mr. Kim.

163
00:11:40,547 --> 00:11:42,749
I think he changed his number.

164
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,461
Can you look into his address?

165
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:50,270
Okay. His address?

166
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:55,488
I don't want anyone to know
what I ask you to do.

167
00:11:57,892 --> 00:11:59,992
Okay. I'll mark your words.

168
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:06,121
Also, many people got fired

169
00:12:06,204 --> 00:12:08,352
just for getting on Ji-hoon's bad side.

170
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,190
Can you put together
a list of their names?

171
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:18,393
Ms. Cho.

172
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:20,803
Yes?

173
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:23,831
Can I trust you?

174
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:27,652
Yes.

175
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:31,520
Thank you.

176
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:32,771
Please enjoy the meal.

177
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:50,926
Public Prosecutor General Lee Seung-moo
and Busan Mayor Oh Myung-hoon are here.

178
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:53,851
How exhausting.

179
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:56,457
Sergeant Choi,
this place has such tight security.

180
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,284
Why did you book a place so high up?

181
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:01,566
This is my pal from the Marine Corps,
Choi Ji-hoon.

182
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:03,388
Hello, Sir. I'm Choi Ji-hoon.

183
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:06,638
I heard a lot about you.

184
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:09,566
We always said we would meet,
and we finally made it today.

185
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:10,612
Gosh.

186
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:13,866
What are you doing? Sit down.
It's so dizzying since we're so high up.

187
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:17,179
I thought I should win the election first

188
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:19,471
before even requesting
to meet someone big like you.

189
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:22,120
He's a sensible guy.

190
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,130
Of course I wouldn't invite just anyone
to meet you.

191
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:30,289
The "Hoon" in our names mean the same.

192
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:31,923
It means "to teach".

193
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:35,113
He's from Tongyeong too.
We're both from the same hometown,

194
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:37,922
and we're practically brothers.

195
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:40,213
You know Prosecutor General Lee
is from Gimhae, right?

196
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:41,378
Of course.

197
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,116
Sir, please let me pour you a drink.

198
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,533
Wait.

199
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,893
-Pass it over.
-Why?

200
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:48,845
The big brother should pour you one first.

201
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:49,797
Why not?

202
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,489
My goodness.

203
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:52,594
Have a drink.

204
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:54,215
It's an honor.

205
00:13:57,613 --> 00:13:58,823
I'll pour you one.

206
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:04,910
Thank you, Myung-hoon.

207
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:06,068
That's enough.

208
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:09,563
-Sergeant Choi, you're a big guy now.
-Here, have a lot.

209
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:49,375
Yes.

210
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,230
Yes.

211
00:14:58,844 --> 00:15:01,287
We had a natural burial yesterday.

212
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,502
In Gapyeong.

213
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:18,695
Stella doesn't know much Korean.

214
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:21,752
No, she doesn't know...

215
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:25,527
that her mom is gone.

216
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:33,319
All that happened
the day before Stella's birthday.

217
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:38,728
-I'll call another time.
-The door's opening.

218
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:42,526
Come on, Stella.

219
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:57,989
The door's closing.

220
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:31,893
Hello.

221
00:16:34,853 --> 00:16:35,687
Are you Reporter Hwang's junior?

222
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,120
Yes, I'm Han Ji-won. Coffee?

223
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:39,471
Yes, thank you.

224
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:41,281
Reporter Hwang told me to go see you

225
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:43,637
if it's something under
Jongno Police Station's jurisdiction.

226
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:47,030
What are you curious about?

227
00:16:47,113 --> 00:16:48,241
Well,

228
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:54,100
it's about the suicide
in Pyeongchang-dong.

229
00:16:54,183 --> 00:16:55,516
That case?

230
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:58,226
There's nothing to it.

231
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:01,244
Did the deceased named Lee Hyun-joo
really commit suicide?

232
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,993
It would be stranger if it wasn't suicide.
All circumstances point to it.

233
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,609
She had stock investment debt
and was getting a divorce,

234
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:11,693
and she had to pay alimony.
She was unlikely to get child custody too.

235
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:15,232
She was drinking a lot,
and frequented the casino.

236
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:17,592
She wasn't someone ordinary.

237
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:22,487
But there is no will.

238
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:24,783
Well,

239
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,764
when people commit suicide after drinking,
it's usually unplanned.

240
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,570
They do it impulsively
after getting drunk.

241
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:34,089
I see.

242
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:36,620
Her mother told us

243
00:17:36,703 --> 00:17:39,493
that she suffered from bipolar disorder
after giving birth in the US.

244
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:41,647
"Bipolar disorder"?

245
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:45,064
Her family reacted
as if it wasn't a surprise.

246
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,981
In the next few days,

247
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:05,980
you should receive some kind of pot
from a private museum.

248
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:10,563
Don't have someone else take it.

249
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:12,470
Deliver it to Minister Park yourself.

250
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:17,015
Is it Star Jar?

251
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,792
It's so tiny, but super expensive.

252
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:23,853
Not "Star".

253
00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:27,213
You must mean "Moon".

254
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:33,702
Moon Jar.

255
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,318
Yes, Moon Jar.

256
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,992
Hey, you should start Instagram.

257
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,919
Everyone does it nowadays.

258
00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:55,265
It'd be too much to tell the secretary
to tell you this.

259
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:06,157
The PR Office
will give you a manual tomorrow.

260
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:31,171
Professor Lee.

261
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,937
How do you know my address?

262
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:37,216
Hello, Mr. Kim.

263
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:41,365
Gosh... Please.

264
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,960
All I did was drive for 25 years.

265
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:56,964
To be honest,
Mr. Choi is hard to work for.

266
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:02,574
I bet I worked for him the longest.

267
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:07,788
It must be tough on you.

268
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:14,440
I'm meeting all the people

269
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:16,036
who got fired suddenly just like you.

270
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,413
Pardon?

271
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:24,656
I'm starting to learn about IT Solid.

272
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:29,532
I found quite a few odd things about it.

273
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:34,162
What do you mean?

274
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:37,242
During the four years of your service,

275
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:40,369
you were with him 18 hours a day.

276
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:44,146
You must know a lot of stuff I don't.

277
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,491
That's true, but--

278
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:48,881
Work-related stuff,

279
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:51,939
as well as personal.

280
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:55,317
Right?

281
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,916
Well...

282
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,646
It's true I feel wronged,

283
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,502
but I also got paid
for signing a non-disclosure agreement.

284
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:11,488
I can't do it.

285
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:16,758
Mr. Kim.

286
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:24,880
Someone like him
shouldn't become the mayor of Seoul.

287
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:31,401
You also know everything

288
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:35,593
about Im Soo-yeon, don't you?

289
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:39,051
Pardon?

290
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,755
LEE HYUN-JOO EQUALS ANNA EQUALS YU-MI

291
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,758
SUICIDE

292
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:57,665
YU-MI AND CHOI JI-HOON

293
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:09,075
They all look for the right time,

294
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:12,050
then line up behind the one
who looks like he'll win.

295
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:15,428
And when that guy wins,
they act like it's thanks to them.

296
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:18,169
They go around talking about that.

297
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,631
Yes. They always have excuses.

298
00:22:23,714 --> 00:22:25,374
But I fight my own fights.

299
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:27,703
You're brave and honest.

300
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:30,576
As for me, I plan everything

301
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,967
and then give them the commands.

302
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,246
Yes. Bravo.

303
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:41,416
Also, voters can be so complicated.

304
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:45,009
They're super complicated
and they complain all the time.

305
00:22:45,092 --> 00:22:48,099
They want housing prices to drop,

306
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:50,432
but their house has to rise in value.

307
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:54,943
They demand that we support
medium-sized companies to grow,

308
00:22:55,026 --> 00:22:57,612
but they only want to work
for conglomerates.

309
00:22:58,809 --> 00:22:59,642
You're right.

310
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:04,303
Part-time and contract workers
shouldn't be discriminated,

311
00:23:05,068 --> 00:23:09,006
but their child must have
a stable full-time job.

312
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:12,536
I know. I know, Ji-hoon.

313
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:16,276
I know how you feel better than anyone.

314
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,047
But you know,

315
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,601
it's currently looking bright for you,

316
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:24,454
but this is when
you must be extra careful.

317
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:27,846
Do you know what I mean?

318
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:32,940
DONATION CERTIFICATE

319
00:23:33,023 --> 00:23:35,018
We'll get a picture of just Professor Lee.

320
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:41,447
Time to eat.

321
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,639
Let's eat.

322
00:23:52,171 --> 00:23:53,913
This exhibition is the very first project

323
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:58,791
to reinterpret literary paintings
from the Joseon Dynasty

324
00:23:58,874 --> 00:24:00,529
which aren't as widely known.

325
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,224
We're here.

326
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:22,213
I don't want to go home.

327
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:42,103
Here are the tax files
you asked for last week.

328
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:56,979
It's hard to do something in secret,
isn't it?

329
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,213
When you put it like that,

330
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:03,509
it feels like difficult work.

331
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:07,253
"Difficult work..."

332
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:10,437
It is.

333
00:25:12,015 --> 00:25:13,733
It's something only you know,

334
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:17,332
and you can't talk to anyone else
about it.

335
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:19,614
It's hard.

336
00:25:21,282 --> 00:25:22,612
More than that...

337
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,029
Go ahead. It's okay.

338
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:38,116
The most difficult thing
is reading the mood of my bosses.

339
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:42,894
"Mood"?

340
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:50,375
There's a limit to how much
I can understand from trying my best.

341
00:25:52,448 --> 00:25:54,431
I know what that's like.

342
00:25:57,363 --> 00:25:58,786
You have to read their eyes,

343
00:26:00,206 --> 00:26:01,472
make presumptions,

344
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,321
and worry about it.

345
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:08,231
How do you know that?

346
00:26:09,871 --> 00:26:11,069
Because

347
00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:14,513
I've been through it before.

348
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:17,325
What?

349
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:25,737
I remember hating it,

350
00:26:29,396 --> 00:26:31,069
but I can't remember what happened after.

351
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,272
What am I doing here?

352
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:44,208
You smoke, right?

353
00:26:45,514 --> 00:26:46,462
Pardon?

354
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:52,073
Yes.

355
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:58,479
I want to try one.

356
00:27:10,187 --> 00:27:12,378
Good work today. See you tomorrow.

357
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:18,651
Don't bother getting out.

358
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:37,990
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

359
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,728
Gosh! You're so handsome.

360
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:43,030
-You're so handsome.
-My goodness.

361
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:46,744
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

362
00:27:47,537 --> 00:27:49,634
-Hello.
-Hello.

363
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:51,616
-You're so handsome.
-Thank you.

364
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,191
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

365
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,091
CHOI JI-HOON REACTS TO THE NEWS
THAT EXPOSED HIS PERSONAL LIFE

366
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:58,780
"THE TRUTH HASN'T BEEN DISCLOSED"

367
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:03,684
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

368
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:11,596
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

369
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:19,052
Could you go buy me a cup of coffee?

370
00:28:22,474 --> 00:28:23,478
Yu-mi!

371
00:28:27,507 --> 00:28:29,446
Sun-woo, are you well?

372
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:31,389
I'm going to Italy next month.

373
00:28:32,522 --> 00:28:33,902
"Italy"?

374
00:28:33,985 --> 00:28:36,282
Yes. I'm going
to a cooking school for a year.

375
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:38,042
I'll go although it'll be short.

376
00:28:39,145 --> 00:28:40,658
I tried to find a new place to work,

377
00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:43,343
but my experiences as a chef
aren't enough.

378
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,458
I see.

379
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:51,770
I worked for Marais for 10 years,
but I didn't even get a severance pay.

380
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,765
Yes, I saw the news.

381
00:28:54,848 --> 00:28:55,971
Did you?

382
00:28:56,784 --> 00:29:00,666
Money sure is scary.
Look at what happened to Little Director.

383
00:29:00,749 --> 00:29:01,641
You're right.

384
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:19,625
What's with the heavy air?

385
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:22,026
Why are you busy?

386
00:29:22,668 --> 00:29:24,706
Hanbit Daily beat us to it.

387
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:27,491
Choi Ji-hoon had a common-law wife,

388
00:29:27,574 --> 00:29:29,650
and even an autistic son.

389
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:31,225
They're currently in the US.

390
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:32,985
What?

391
00:29:33,342 --> 00:29:35,928
Hey. Just publish
what you're writing right now

392
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:37,879
and keep on releasing more stories
than them.

393
00:29:37,962 --> 00:29:38,888
Yes, Sir!

394
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:40,226
-Reporter Hwang.
-Yes?

395
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:42,233
You're booked for an interview
with Lee Anna.

396
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:44,612
-They'll tell you the date later.
-Yes, Sir.

397
00:29:51,974 --> 00:29:53,187
Mr. Jung.

398
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:55,383
Well...

399
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:00,139
How many presidential candidates

400
00:30:00,222 --> 00:30:02,555
were booted out because of women?

401
00:30:04,014 --> 00:30:05,112
Four, Sir.

402
00:30:05,758 --> 00:30:08,755
I see. You know it so well.

403
00:30:12,218 --> 00:30:13,532
You know it well.

404
00:30:17,297 --> 00:30:19,893
You guys told me to be careful,

405
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,513
so I didn't even go near hostess bars
ever since I got elected as the candidate.

406
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,339
I always do what you tell me to do,

407
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,794
but what have you done?

408
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,011
How did they find out...

409
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:43,025
that my son is in the US, you idiots?

410
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:49,134
Mr. Jung. What is your job?

411
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:51,273
Well?

412
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:55,538
What is your job here?

413
00:30:56,382 --> 00:30:57,212
I'm sorry, Sir.

414
00:30:57,295 --> 00:31:00,234
Do you think sitting here in style
and ordering the guys what to do

415
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,770
can solve everything?

416
00:31:03,757 --> 00:31:04,730
What is that?

417
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,804
A negative article about Professor Lee
was published.

418
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:22,070
Let me see it.

419
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,167
It's not a flaw
to get married twice these days.

420
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:30,505
That couple doesn't have a child.

421
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,433
On top of that, his son is autistic,

422
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,363
so there's a humane story attached.

423
00:31:34,446 --> 00:31:35,874
What an amazing couple.

424
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:39,889
What about his common-law wife?

425
00:31:39,972 --> 00:31:41,606
Her name is Im Soo-yeon.

426
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,249
But she's nowhere to be found.

427
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:47,104
"Im Soo-yeon"?

428
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:52,757
Right. Lee Jung-il's property
that was bought under a borrowed name...

429
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,532
I heard
Choi Ji-hoon gave the story to you.

430
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,877
Ma'am, one more beer please.

431
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,095
Don't pretend ignorance.
Why didn't you write it?

432
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:05,605
That...

433
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:11,686
It just didn't feel like something for me.

434
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:15,094
You're strong-willed.

435
00:32:15,177 --> 00:32:18,560
It's not about being strong-willed.
I have brave principles.

436
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:21,807
Sure.

437
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,080
Usually, brave people like you

438
00:32:24,163 --> 00:32:25,862
die first in movies.

439
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:29,104
What is this?
You should be praising me as my senior.

440
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:32,992
In my opinion, you're a loner
because you're neither this nor that.

441
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:35,066
I have two kids.

442
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:37,719
A father must live ambiguously.

443
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,691
Nothing is as scary as an honest advisor
who is prepared to die.

444
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:48,880
Nothing can be as empty
as the courage of the weak.

445
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:51,665
Your ancestors barely made a living
with the petty job in the countryside

446
00:32:51,748 --> 00:32:54,518
-before your father finally set foot...
-Ma'am, what is that?

447
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:57,827
It's a drama. Rerun of Jung Do-jeon.

448
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,047
If you want to change the world,
become powerful first.

449
00:33:00,465 --> 00:33:03,659
If the world could change just from a fuss
from someone like you,

450
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:06,698
they wouldn't call this anarchy.

451
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,677
Wow.

452
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:16,624
Did he try to buy me over
with a drama line?

453
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:18,462
Who?

454
00:33:19,546 --> 00:33:21,759
On top of that,
it wasn't even Jung Do-jeon who said it!

455
00:33:21,842 --> 00:33:24,900
-What are you saying?
-I don't know. You don't have to know.

456
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,966
-Hey, Ji-won.
-What?

457
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:28,274
What's with this trending search?

458
00:33:28,357 --> 00:33:29,594
What is it?

459
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:30,745
"Lee Anna".

460
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:34,113
It keeps on trending.

461
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:38,311
1. GHOST WRITER WROTE THESIS
FOR CHOI JI-HOON'S WIFE

462
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:43,726
1. CHOI JI-HOON
2. CHOI JI-HOON'S WIFE

463
00:33:45,576 --> 00:33:47,342
3. CHOI JI-HOON AND LEE ANNA
4. LEE ANNA

464
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,838
3. LEE ANNA
4. PROFESSOR LEE ANNA

465
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,835
Professor Lee.
You didn't pick up, so I came up.

466
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:58,461
Mr. Choi is looking for you.

467
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:00,590
Where is he?

468
00:34:00,673 --> 00:34:02,171
At the campaign camp.

469
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,158
I can't believe such a thing happened.

470
00:34:09,241 --> 00:34:10,953
Seriously.

471
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:15,800
Anyway, I owe you.

472
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:19,764
Yes.

473
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:21,929
Let's take care of it that way.

474
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:23,594
Yes, okay.

475
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:33,908
Were you startled?

476
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,618
About what?

477
00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:41,298
Sit down.

478
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,420
Alex White?

479
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:50,220
We found him.

480
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,268
What?

481
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:58,928
The rumor about a ghost writer
writing your thesis is a false accusation.

482
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:02,144
They published a false story
based on a baseless rumor

483
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:05,032
in order to ruin Mr. Choi's reputation.
I already checked on it.

484
00:35:05,115 --> 00:35:06,832
Luckily, it's almost morning in New York,

485
00:35:06,915 --> 00:35:10,390
so Alex White will hold an interview
in about three hours

486
00:35:10,473 --> 00:35:13,492
saying that he didn't write for you,
but that he was your study partner.

487
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,294
It'll be on the 8:00 a.m. news tomorrow.
That's all.

488
00:35:17,377 --> 00:35:18,636
Good work.

489
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,651
You must be really upset, Ma'am.

490
00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:23,204
You won't have to
worry about this anymore.

491
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:24,937
Okay, okay.

492
00:35:41,132 --> 00:35:44,955
Avoid reporters for a while,
and don't expose yourself to the media.

493
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:48,415
I won't let you get away with it
if things go wrong.

494
00:35:53,357 --> 00:35:54,945
So you already know everything.

495
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:06,737
Do you think you can live
as Lee Yu-mi again?

496
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:21,759
Alex.

497
00:36:24,023 --> 00:36:28,202
How do you think I managed to find
that thesis broker so fast?

498
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:30,514
Aren't you curious?

499
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:46,432
Did you meet Lee Hyun-joo?

500
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:03,972
That crazy fearless woman contacted me.

501
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,007
It was you...

502
00:37:33,823 --> 00:37:34,772
Be quiet.

503
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:50,361
Cho Yu-mi!

504
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:54,884
Take Professor Lee home.

505
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:24,232
Yu-mi.

506
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:46,661
When I was young,

507
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:50,940
the adults told me I look like a princess

508
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:54,750
and called me Anastasia.

509
00:38:56,708 --> 00:39:01,357
That's why my second name
is its short form, Anna.

510
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:05,398
But it turns out,

511
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:09,870
someone named Anna Anderson

512
00:39:12,298 --> 00:39:14,511
had been living

513
00:39:14,594 --> 00:39:17,143
as if she's someone named Anastasia
who had died already.

514
00:39:28,337 --> 00:39:29,922
Once I found out about that,

515
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:34,482
I stopped using that name.

516
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:54,956
You were standing in front of me
like this.

517
00:40:01,947 --> 00:40:04,156
How was it living like you're me?

518
00:40:06,422 --> 00:40:07,477
Were you happy?

519
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:19,351
What I stole was fake too.

520
00:40:20,593 --> 00:40:23,024
Is that why Lee Anna had that face on

521
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,924
while killing Lee Hyun-joo?

522
00:40:28,746 --> 00:40:29,892
It wasn't me...

523
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,174
who did that.

524
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:35,325
No?

525
00:40:47,915 --> 00:40:49,647
Just because you're foolish and pitiful,

526
00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:54,278
doesn't mean you'll be forgiven.

527
00:40:59,154 --> 00:41:01,325
Is it because they read
Divine Comedy by Dante?

528
00:41:03,515 --> 00:41:05,482
Most people think

529
00:41:08,393 --> 00:41:10,217
hell is a space.

530
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:17,985
But in fact,
it's not a space, but a situation.

531
00:41:28,023 --> 00:41:29,455
Don't be so fast to cry.

532
00:41:33,751 --> 00:41:35,337
Hell only starts now.

533
00:42:14,526 --> 00:42:16,047
What do we do with you, Anna?

534
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,514
You'll have to be lucky every time
in order to survive.

535
00:42:37,924 --> 00:42:40,672
You'll only realize after you get it

536
00:42:42,325 --> 00:42:44,874
whether you really wanted it or not.

537
00:43:15,564 --> 00:43:16,776
Who is it?

538
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:20,498
Ji-won.

539
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:22,871
It's me, Yu-mi.
