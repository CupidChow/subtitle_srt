1
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,563
The thing with people is that

2
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,609
they lie even in the diary
no one else reads.

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,589
-Hey, it's Choi Ji-hoon!
-Thank you.

4
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:27,841
EPISODE 6

5
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:32,939
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

6
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:36,192
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

7
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:41,322
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,381
You have a meeting in an hour
with the Secretary for Political Affairs.

9
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:47,612
I'll take you right to the meeting place.

10
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:48,661
Okay.

11
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:50,963
Also, here.

12
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,722
Here are the interview questions
for tomorrow.

13
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,565
You knew from the start,
and you're looking after him even now.

14
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:11,817
Got it?

15
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:20,092
We purposefully waited
until the bad comments reached its height.

16
00:01:22,357 --> 00:01:23,560
You can cry a little too.

17
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,647
If you can't make yourself to cry,
it's fine.

18
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,950
CANDIDATE CHOI JI-HOON MAKES
THE YOUNGER GENERATION CHEER

19
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,880
He's getting more malicious comments
ever since the news about his son,

20
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:44,024
but the number of supporters grew.

21
00:01:44,107 --> 00:01:46,507
I wish the elections would end soon.

22
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,107
Same. So many people are sacrificing

23
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,351
to get him that title.

24
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:55,934
Do you think it's really him
that got him so popular?

25
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:58,836
If you look up on the Internet,
people only talk about Anna.

26
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:04,255
Right,
you're interviewing Anna tomorrow, right?

27
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:06,400
-What?
-That's right.

28
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:08,099
I'll finally get to meet her in person.

29
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:13,265
Hey. Is she always that graceful?

30
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,168
Right.
How come you never write about Anna?

31
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:20,464
Are you stupid?

32
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:22,030
Because I know her.

33
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,196
Is that so?

34
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:26,885
How professional you are.

35
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:29,580
She has such upright work ethics.

36
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:31,432
-You're right.
-Should we compliment her?

37
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:40,971
The Secretary for Political Affairs
will be 20 minutes late.

38
00:02:41,054 --> 00:02:42,024
Okay.

39
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,201
You must think I don't know anything

40
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:01,292
since I feign ignorance.

41
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:07,043
No, I know you're a good actress.

42
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,601
On our wedding day,

43
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:15,561
we took a picture with your nephew
named Choi Min-jae.

44
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:20,567
Yes. When I think about it now,

45
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:23,424
it was definitely strange.

46
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:26,705
And also,

47
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:31,421
Im Soo-yeon is nowhere to be found.

48
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:32,436
Hey.

49
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:40,208
Ms. Lee Yu-mi,
the daughter of Baekma Tailor's mute.

50
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:48,803
Did you suddenly become curious
about the truth?

51
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,461
Im Soo-yeon was a kind person

52
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:57,170
who sacrificed herself for you for years.

53
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:01,091
She apparently went to Jeju Island

54
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,801
right after giving birth,
and was found dead from falling.

55
00:04:05,638 --> 00:04:07,035
How did that happen?

56
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,436
You must have nothing to fear

57
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:21,106
now that Lee Hyun-joo is gone.

58
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,762
Does it look like that?

59
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:28,994
I'm glad you noticed.

60
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:50,987
Do you know how tiring it was for me
because of Hyun-joo?

61
00:04:57,357 --> 00:04:59,270
All you needed was for her to disappear.

62
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,345
And I let that happen for you.

63
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,699
But still,
how could you do that to someone?

64
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:19,544
You even changed your name
to live like her.

65
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:21,365
Why are you complaining?

66
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:23,638
I see.

67
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:31,670
Are you saying I'm just complaining?

68
00:06:15,837 --> 00:06:17,665
Didn't you want that woman dead?

69
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:23,055
You're an accomplice anyway.

70
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:37,212
Just a minute.

71
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:44,958
Go.

72
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:55,076
Let's be good, okay?

73
00:06:58,427 --> 00:06:59,391
Come in.

74
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,421
Secretary Lee Chang-yong is here.

75
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:09,388
Gosh, I'm late.

76
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,007
Sorry. I was suddenly called by the VIP.

77
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,656
That's okay, Sir. We just arrived too.

78
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,026
Really?

79
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:16,288
Honey, say hello.

80
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:20,353
Nice to meet you.

81
00:07:20,436 --> 00:07:21,643
Please sit down.

82
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:25,702
How do you feel
with the election around the corner?

83
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,283
CHOI JI-HOON CRIES FOR STRONGER SEOUL
PROMISES TO BUILD A HAPPY CITY

84
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:43,452
CHOI JI-HOON CRIES FOR STRONGER SEOUL
PROMISES TO BUILD A HAPPY CITY

85
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:52,829
CANDIDATE CHOI JI-HOON AND WIFE LEE ANNA
POUR THEIR ALL INTO ELECTION CAMPAIGN

86
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:02,121
The rumor about a ghost writer
writing my thesis isn't important to me.

87
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:05,728
I can handle such a gossip.

88
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,290
But

89
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:16,158
having a sick child

90
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:20,831
become a part of this controversy
is hard to bear.

91
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:27,753
My husband and I

92
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:31,511
will not let such speculations and rumors
about the birth mother bother us,

93
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:37,992
and we won't be taking any legal measures
against Hanbit Daily either.

94
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:46,702
Are we done?

95
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:50,677
Yes.

96
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,044
Thank you for your time.

97
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:58,676
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

98
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,922
It seems like Professor Lee
accepted some money.

99
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:10,440
From whom?

100
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:16,082
What is this?

101
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:23,515
"Lee So-hyun, Lee Bo-ram, Han Ji-hye..."

102
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:26,028
How much is all this?

103
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,122
What we were able to find out
seems to add up to 2.7 billion won.

104
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:35,186
Do you mean there might be more?

105
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:37,164
Yes.

106
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,437
Get out.

107
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:00,966
DR. LEE JAE-EOL

108
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:06,940
Hello, Dr. Lee.

109
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,249
Are you well?

110
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:13,837
It's nothing much,

111
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,611
but my wife
is emotionally unstable these days.

112
00:10:22,985 --> 00:10:24,019
Yes, yes.

113
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,298
It impacts her daily life.

114
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:32,518
It's election season,

115
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:38,763
so let's wait until after.

116
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,968
I want her to take a break
somewhere quiet.

117
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:44,709
Getting her admitted would be good too.

118
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:48,651
BUILDING SEOUL'S FUTURE TOGETHER,
LEAVE IT TO CHOI JI-HOON

119
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,305
You didn't know
what Professor Lee was up to?

120
00:10:58,183 --> 00:11:00,364
She didn't meet that many people

121
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:02,921
while I was escorting her.

122
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:07,540
When she met with Madam Lee So-hyun,

123
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:10,734
I thought it was a bit strange,
but I had no idea.

124
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:13,740
You should've reported it
if you found it strange.

125
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:18,518
To be honest, I can't do anything

126
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:20,448
if she goes out without telling me.

127
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:22,118
Why can't you do anything?

128
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,517
Do you hear yourself?

129
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:27,974
Are you a civil servant
who only does what you're told?

130
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:35,381
This is why we shouldn't have picked
a woman to join our team.

131
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,194
She knows very well

132
00:11:44,277 --> 00:11:47,174
I was ordered by Mr. Choi to watch her.

133
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:49,465
She would never do things like that
out in the open for me to notice.

134
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:51,434
Darn it. Shut your mouth.

135
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:58,158
You'll be responsible for this.

136
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:03,305
Write a written apology
and make a copy of her phone.

137
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,488
Also,

138
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:16,482
we received two calls today
asking if Lee Anna is her real name.

139
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:17,680
Check them.

140
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,969
HIDDEN LOVE OF LEE ANNA,
THE WIFE OF CANDIDATE CHOI JI-HOON

141
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:26,764
-What's with this comment?
-Isn't it crazy?

142
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,259
How compassionate.

143
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:33,362
People can be so simple.

144
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:40,160
Do you think that interview was sincere?

145
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:43,669
You're so inflexible.

146
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:45,393
It doesn't matter
as long as it speaks to people.

147
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:48,746
Did you find her beautiful in person?

148
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:52,619
Yes.

149
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:55,056
I can see why people like her so much.

150
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,252
She smiled at me
and my heart skipped a beat.

151
00:12:57,335 --> 00:12:58,845
-Right?
-Yes.

152
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,204
Hurry up and join her fan club.

153
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:02,259
I should.

154
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,233
Mom.

155
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:07,042
My daughter is in the US.

156
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:13,273
Can you help me write a letter to her?

157
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,517
I cannot talk,

158
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,799
so I can't call her.

159
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:33,934
What would you like me to write?

160
00:14:37,716 --> 00:14:43,524
That her mom misses Yu-mi.

161
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:20,854
IS THIS THE RIGHT THING TO DO?
IS THIS SOMETHING I CAN HANDLE?

162
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:26,509
Ji-won.

163
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:29,993
It's me, Yu-mi.

164
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:39,679
Yu-mi.

165
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:43,469
I'm sorry I came over so early.

166
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:54,470
This is so awkward.

167
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,228
I don't know where I should start.

168
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:05,482
Maybe how Lee Yu-mi became Anna?

169
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,731
So you know everything.

170
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,108
I was really confused at first,

171
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:17,010
but I was able to put things together.

172
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,936
When I thought about it,
there wasn't a single thing

173
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,527
I knew about you.

174
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:26,697
I'm sorry.

175
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:30,940
Why did you do that?

176
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,317
It's hard to explain.

177
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:48,500
Not all who had a hard time growing up
live like you.

178
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:50,582
I tried my best,

179
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:53,821
but it didn't work out.

180
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:57,723
Is that all?

181
00:16:57,806 --> 00:16:58,972
I envied

182
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:02,923
Lee Hyun-joo.

183
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:14,144
Since Lee Anna is someone
who is influential to our society,

184
00:17:14,227 --> 00:17:16,517
I decided to tell the world about you.

185
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,019
Before, I was afraid

186
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,908
of being found out.

187
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:34,154
But not anymore.

188
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:39,433
I want you to write about me

189
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,503
and let the Prosecution know too.

190
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:54,126
What is this?

191
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:56,936
The story

192
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,337
of Lee Anna and Choi Ji-hoon.

193
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,147
Lee Hyun-joo didn't commit suicide.

194
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:12,670
Ji-hoon's previous wife Im Soo-yeon
didn't have an accidental death either.

195
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,625
LEE ANNA'S BRIBES
LEE HYUN-JOO

196
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,600
RECORDING OF WITNESS
STATEMENT OF WITNESS

197
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:18,221
STATEMENT OF WITNESS: KIM JUNG-HAN

198
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:22,054
VICTIM, WITNESS

199
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:26,324
Stock manipulation,
embezzlement, and dodging taxes.

200
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,499
There is a list
of the bribes Lee Anna accepted too.

201
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,244
You'll be surprised once you open it.

202
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,880
Choi Ji-hoon's son,

203
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:40,618
and Lee Anna's ghost writer...

204
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,791
I tried to expose them myself,

205
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,664
but I was stopped.

206
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:50,615
You were the one?

207
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:52,313
Yes.

208
00:18:55,253 --> 00:18:58,944
I think it would be best to use it
just after the election,

209
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:01,520
but before his post starts
when his guards are down.

210
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,818
Why are you giving this to me?

211
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:12,744
Because

212
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:18,424
you're the only one who called me by Yu-mi

213
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:22,697
and worried about me.

214
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:28,592
This is my apology to you and Hyun-joo.

215
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:39,744
You'll lose everything.
It'll be hard to bear.

216
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:44,215
I'm

217
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,377
prepared for it now.

218
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,298
I think I got this far

219
00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:01,969
so I could break down like this.

220
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:12,049
You might get sentenced to serve time.

221
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:17,192
Don't worry.

222
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:20,618
I'll survive on my own.

223
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:36,593
If anything ever happens to me,

224
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:40,458
could you take care of that patient
for me?

225
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:46,013
What do you mean?

226
00:20:47,774 --> 00:20:48,938
I don't know.

227
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:52,064
I'm trying not to think about it.

228
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:58,297
They say people become cowardly
because they have imagination.

229
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:03,799
Yes, Ma'am.

230
00:21:12,111 --> 00:21:14,464
You shouldn't get timid
in front of your parents either.

231
00:21:16,437 --> 00:21:19,531
You become independent
once you stop feeling guilty

232
00:21:19,614 --> 00:21:22,499
about disappointing your parents.

233
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,754
That's what I regret the most.

234
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:42,267
Now, with my wife who is always beside me
and backing me up,

235
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,252
we'll say our goodbyes to you together.

236
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:51,548
We hope to meet all of you here again.

237
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:53,401
We love you. Thank you.

238
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:58,622
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

239
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:01,560
Candidate Choi Ji-hoon
and his wife Lee Anna

240
00:22:01,643 --> 00:22:04,242
visited a nearby voting station
this morning

241
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:08,295
to cast their votes
and greeted other voters.

242
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:10,998
Yes. It was difficult
to run the election campaign,

243
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:13,443
but I have no regrets
since I gave it my all.

244
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,195
Thank you for your support...

245
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:16,200
Hey, Han Ji-won.

246
00:22:17,454 --> 00:22:19,600
-Yes?
-Come here for a second.

247
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:21,158
Thank you.

248
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:23,708
CHOI JI-HOON AND WIFE LEE ANNA
VOTE TOGETHER

249
00:22:33,994 --> 00:22:36,260
Is something bothering you?

250
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:41,606
I feel uneasy.

251
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:44,517
Pardon?

252
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,726
As of today, you're fired.

253
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,823
What? What do you mean?

254
00:22:57,906 --> 00:23:00,123
You must have known

255
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:03,085
the work you were doing

256
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:05,357
would have to come to an end.

257
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:13,272
To be honest, I didn't trust you at first.

258
00:23:15,324 --> 00:23:17,265
Thank you for keeping your promise.

259
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:24,991
I couldn't understand you at first,

260
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:30,737
but I believe what you're doing is right.

261
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:36,736
I'll be taken in by Prosecution
tomorrow afternoon.

262
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:39,620
Then,

263
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:46,397
you'll be put in an awkward position.

264
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:59,413
I'll serve you until the very end.

265
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:08,523
No matter who you are,
you're still my employer.

266
00:24:14,964 --> 00:24:16,236
You're going to regret it.

267
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:18,724
Although I'm weak,

268
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,131
I want to stay loyal.

269
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:28,764
"Loyal"?

270
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:32,654
I've never

271
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:37,969
been loyal to anyone.

272
00:24:44,796 --> 00:24:45,637
Good job.

273
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,334
In the Gyeonggi region,
Choi Yeon-duk is ahead by a narrow margin.

274
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,795
SEOUL: CHOI JI-HOON 50.1 PERCENT,
LEE SUN-HO 46.6 PERCENT

275
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,772
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

276
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,484
MOM'S NURSING HOME

277
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,680
Hello?

278
00:25:08,763 --> 00:25:11,528
Patient Yoon Hong-ju
is asking for you, Ms. Lee Yu-mi.

279
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,568
I don't think she'll last very long.

280
00:25:16,928 --> 00:25:17,839
Next is the Seoul mayor.

281
00:25:17,922 --> 00:25:20,423
Innovative Seoul, Choi Ji-hoon!

282
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:22,983
-With 50.4 percent, it's confirmed.
-Confirmed.

283
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:30,551
CHOI JI-HOON ELECTED AS SEOUL MAYOR
50.4 PERCENT

284
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:36,203
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

285
00:25:39,815 --> 00:25:41,041
Congratulations.

286
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,007
Congratulations.

287
00:25:47,454 --> 00:25:51,464
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

288
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:55,570
Dear respected Seoul citizens.

289
00:25:55,653 --> 00:26:00,020
I want to thank everyone who worked hard

290
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:02,304
to support me until the very end.

291
00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:06,203
All my supporters...

292
00:26:06,286 --> 00:26:07,116
Yes.

293
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,541
Really?

294
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:12,660
Are you sure about that?

295
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:14,868
Yes.

296
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:18,750
-Hey, Ji-won.
-Yes?

297
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,581
You're on standby at the airport
this morning.

298
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:21,810
It's an early morning flight.

299
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,403
Okay.

300
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:26,056
Why doesn't he take a break?
That Choi Ji-hoon never gets tired.

301
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:27,327
He's the annoying type.

302
00:26:32,162 --> 00:26:33,779
YU-MI: WHEN JI-HOON GETS ON THE FLIGHT
TO AMERICA TOMORROW MORNING,

303
00:26:33,862 --> 00:26:35,536
THAT MIGHT BE OUR CHANCE

304
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,726
Hello?

305
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:03,703
Are you Prosecutor Lee Duk-chan?

306
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:10,813
Thank you for your work.

307
00:27:12,138 --> 00:27:13,268
Gosh.

308
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:18,031
You can head for the airport in two hours.

309
00:27:18,682 --> 00:27:22,018
The place Min-jae is at
is quite far from San Francisco.

310
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:24,413
It'll be tiring
to drive the car yourself...

311
00:27:24,496 --> 00:27:26,625
The distance is about the same
from here to Busan, right?

312
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,876
It's okay.
I traveled across the States before.

313
00:27:33,377 --> 00:27:34,828
You can go.

314
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:37,130
Mayor, congratulations!

315
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:38,839
Thank you.

316
00:27:42,022 --> 00:27:44,504
Congratulations, Professor Lee.

317
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:46,972
-Go. Hurry up and go now.
-Okay.

318
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:49,108
Go and rest.

319
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:36,233
Congratulations
on getting what you wanted.

320
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:45,021
But

321
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:50,071
I have to leave right now.

322
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:52,915
Where to?

323
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:57,732
My mom is in a critical state.

324
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:03,174
Your mom is in the UK.

325
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,305
Jerk.

326
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,537
I'm joking.

327
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:19,747
But you know, now is not a good time.

328
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:24,323
Wait.

329
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:32,269
-Mr. Jung.
-The door's opening.

330
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:38,414
Send someone to Hana Nursing Home
in Gangwon-do right now.

331
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,084
-Yes, send Ms. Cho.
-The door's closing.

332
00:29:44,191 --> 00:29:45,106
Yes.

333
00:29:50,182 --> 00:29:51,224
Out of the way!

334
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:55,362
Move back!

335
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:56,941
He's coming out!

336
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,272
Please say a few words!

337
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:06,888
When are you coming back?

338
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,080
Excuse me.

339
00:30:11,838 --> 00:30:14,078
Do not swarm around, it's dangerous!

340
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:15,222
Please let them pass.

341
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:21,125
Reporters, please make way.
Passing through.

342
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:22,667
Move your head! Geez.

343
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,944
Passing through.

344
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:28,545
Our plane is prepared to depart.

345
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:31,666
Please fasten your seat belts

346
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:34,967
and switch your electronic devices
to airplane mode.

347
00:30:36,493 --> 00:30:37,601
MS. CHO

348
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:40,851
Hello?

349
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,667
Professor Lee.

350
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,166
Ms. Yoon Hong-ju who was in her 70s

351
00:30:47,249 --> 00:30:49,776
passed away this morning

352
00:30:52,057 --> 00:30:53,561
at 6:54 a.m.

353
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:01,222
Honey, give me your passport.

354
00:32:04,306 --> 00:32:05,256
Why?

355
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:08,295
We need it for the insurance.

356
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:02,464
JI-WON: THE PROSECUTOR IS READY,
BUT SOMEONE AT THE TOP IS STOPPING US

357
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,510
I'VE BEEN THERE FOR 14 HOURS,
BUT THEY WON'T LET ME SEE HIM

358
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,600
Are you tired?

359
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:21,455
I gave it a bit of thought,

360
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,001
and I think it'd be best
if you take a break.

361
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:37,531
My schedule was packed,
but I pushed to make this happen.

362
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,507
We didn't come here
to get Min-jae, did we?

363
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:48,095
When the news on him went out last time,

364
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:50,719
I moved him to Australia.

365
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,922
Stop the car and give me back my passport.

366
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:05,770
It's a newly built place,

367
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:12,744
so the facilities are nice
and the surrounding view is beautiful.

368
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:18,130
Where?

369
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:20,335
You know,

370
00:34:21,243 --> 00:34:25,667
when one focuses on oneself too much,

371
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:28,062
you can get depressed.

372
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:32,125
You should go where the air is nice

373
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:36,321
and take a break
while thinking things over.

374
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,921
You've never been to the US before, right?

375
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:30,676
PROSECUTOR LEE DUK-CHAN

376
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,154
Gosh.

377
00:37:17,896 --> 00:37:18,922
Oh my.

378
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:23,011
Shoot. Darn it.

379
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:29,997
Darn it.

380
00:38:39,298 --> 00:38:40,403
Hey!

381
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:44,242
Hey, come here and grab this.

382
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:47,308
Lee Anna.

383
00:38:50,391 --> 00:38:52,284
Darn it.

384
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,929
Damn it!

385
00:38:58,007 --> 00:39:00,324
JI-WON: YU-MI,
I DON'T THINK PROSECUTION WILL HELP

386
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:02,605
I'LL FIND ANOTHER WAY BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE

387
00:39:05,294 --> 00:39:06,546
Darn it.

388
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,044
Hey!

389
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:10,766
Anna, what are you doing?

390
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,506
Come back here!

391
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:19,791
The thing with people is that

392
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:21,407
they lie even in the diary
no one else reads.

393
00:39:23,868 --> 00:39:26,626
But the truth is simple

394
00:39:26,709 --> 00:39:28,799
and lies are complicated.

395
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:33,020
Anyone who knows the reason to live

396
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,526
can endure any situation.

397
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:58,025
Darn it.

398
00:40:01,322 --> 00:40:03,228
Hey! Hey!

399
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:11,823
SOO-MI'S PORK BONE SOUP

400
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:16,034
Lee Yu-mi!

401
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:18,947
If you endure it all,

402
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,339
the chance will definitely come.

403
00:40:29,038 --> 00:40:30,604
It has always been like that.

404
00:40:32,586 --> 00:40:35,676
I always do everything

405
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,116
I set my mind to.

406
00:40:46,506 --> 00:40:47,971
Step back!

407
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:51,323
At 6:10 a.m. local time

408
00:40:51,406 --> 00:40:53,794
on Route 50, California,

409
00:40:53,877 --> 00:40:57,391
Seoul Mayor Choi Ji-hoon was found dead.

410
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:01,780
The rental car Choi was in
had completely burned down.

411
00:41:01,863 --> 00:41:04,851
A search to find
the whereabouts of his wife Lee Anna,

412
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:08,351
who is presumed to have accompanied him,
is ongoing.

413
00:41:13,257 --> 00:41:14,682
So many are falling off.

414
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:17,233
MEMORIAL ALTAR
FOR SEOUL MAYOR CHOI JI-HOON

415
00:41:17,316 --> 00:41:18,774
What is this?

416
00:41:22,258 --> 00:41:24,230
He doesn't have any mourners.

417
00:41:25,844 --> 00:41:27,749
Everyone else aside from us are reporters.

418
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:30,301
Those associated with him must be scared.

419
00:41:30,384 --> 00:41:34,203
Even the public prosecutor was booted.
Who would dare to come here?

420
00:41:35,586 --> 00:41:36,813
That's true.

421
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,650
So, how is your new place?

422
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,821
I get a lot of sunlight.

423
00:41:54,904 --> 00:41:57,906
It ventilates well,
and the water pressure is good.

424
00:41:57,989 --> 00:42:00,720
Right. My furnace is brand new.

425
00:42:00,803 --> 00:42:01,909
New is good.

426
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,662
Furnace...

427
00:42:04,595 --> 00:42:06,121
Are you that happy?

428
00:42:06,204 --> 00:42:10,920
The thing is, these are bare necessities

429
00:42:11,003 --> 00:42:13,484
a person needs to live.

430
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,570
-That's true.
-So

431
00:42:15,653 --> 00:42:18,925
I don't know why I'm so moved by it.

432
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,808
Having money is the best.

433
00:42:22,891 --> 00:42:24,896
Money is great.

434
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:27,342
You skipped over three pay grades.

435
00:42:27,972 --> 00:42:31,153
Now you get twice as much money.
It must be great.

436
00:42:31,236 --> 00:42:33,992
It is. It's totally great.

437
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:38,175
But you still regret turning down
a major station, right?

438
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,526
Long time ago,

439
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:48,292
someone told me I wouldn't last
while doing things the way I do.

440
00:42:51,398 --> 00:42:55,925
But I'll endure it and tough it out.

441
00:42:56,008 --> 00:42:59,275
I'll keep on writing exclusives
and boast around.

442
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:01,791
That would be so annoying to watch.
You'll be hated.

443
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:04,319
Well, it's not any different
from when I got hired through connections.

444
00:43:06,188 --> 00:43:07,960
I'll just hang in there.

445
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,940
Okay. Hang in there.

446
00:43:10,023 --> 00:43:12,085
-I'll do it well.
-Okay.

447
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:15,538
In the history of plane crashes,

448
00:43:15,621 --> 00:43:19,515
Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 still remains
the most mysterious.

449
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:23,416
After four years of investigation,
it will come to a close this month.

450
00:43:24,911 --> 00:43:28,345
Do you think Lee Anna is still alive?

451
00:43:59,295 --> 00:44:00,935
Are you well?

452
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:34,780
Why did you come all the way out here?

453
00:46:34,863 --> 00:46:37,211
You might run into a bear.

454
00:48:46,455 --> 00:48:47,304
Hey.

455
00:48:48,013 --> 00:48:50,553
Hey! Are you crazy?
