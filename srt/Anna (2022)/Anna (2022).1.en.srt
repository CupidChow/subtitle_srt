1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,312
Korean audio translator, translation and timing: Maram

2
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,487
I've always been like this

3
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:12,493
When I make up my mind to do something

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,103
I do it no matter what

5
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,101
- the first episode -

6
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:55,272
People...

7
00:01:57,073 --> 00:02:02,208
They even lie in their private diaries

8
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:18,978
They seem to be the soldiers you told me about yesterday

9
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:29,737
hello daily

10
00:02:32,143 --> 00:02:34,163
This is what I told you about yesterday

11
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:42,048
This is Sangho, the tailor I told you about before

12
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,491
Tailor Sangho, nice to meet you

13
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:46,255
This is my wife, Catherine

14
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:50,285
This is Phillips and his wife

15
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:53,521
What is your name?

16
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:55,289
Her name is Yumi

17
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,734
I have a day and I am six years old

18
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:02,679
What a beautiful name

19
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,778
Can you play the piano?

20
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,569
She asks you about your ability to play the piano

21
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:22,230
Do you want me to teach you to play a real piano?

22
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:36,925
Teapot

23
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:41,918
spoon

24
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,306
Don't memorize the piano keys while you're playing

25
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:54,093
Try to read and understand the tones

26
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:56,185
But I remember

27
00:03:56,972 --> 00:04:00,000
Right, you're smart enough to learn anything quickly

28
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:11,642
I know life in Korea makes you feel lonely

29
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:14,254
But that doesn't mean you can lie to people

30
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:17,291
You are not from a noble family

31
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:20,217
You are not related to Princess Diana

32
00:04:20,963 --> 00:04:23,546
I hate living in this country place

33
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:26,558
I don't want people to belittle me

34
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,782
For heaven's sake Catherine! no one underestimates you

35
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:35,410
It's just your fantasies, you think the world revolves around you

36
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,853
Think as you like

37
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:43,817
You won my day

38
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:47,896
You may have won, but you missed something

39
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:50,897
Your facial expression changed when you got the ice card

40
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:52,172
Why?

41
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:56,669
You can only win if your opponent doesn't know what cards you have

42
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,923
It's not just about poker

43
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,409
Make sure to stop others from reading your thoughts

44
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:11,884
daily

45
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,342
Remember

46
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:16,067
poker face

47
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:37,688
I

48
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:39,734
worry about my day

49
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:45,056
I don't know who she's like but she wants to do a lot, eat a lot

50
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,789
And what is wrong with this?

51
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,174
We have nothing

52
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:56,580
Don't worry about this my day you can manage

53
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,056
Welcome

54
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:15,474
my day

55
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:16,031
yes

56
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:19,032
Are you really going to stop after this week?

57
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:20,231
Yes

58
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:21,034
Why?

59
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:23,164
You are good keep it up

60
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:25,987
ballet for me

61
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:30,117
just a hobby

62
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:35,623
but...

63
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,551
If you stop now

64
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,632
These rumors will become true

65
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,727
What?

66
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:45,471
Any rumors?

67
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:47,427
Bora said

68
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:51,481
She saw your shop in the market

69
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:54,006
and that you are poor

70
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:56,310
And also?

71
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,846
that your mother

72
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,464
dumb

73
00:07:06,782 --> 00:07:07,459
truly?

74
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:20,530
I'll stop in two months really

75
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,152
Let me continue until the competition this fall

76
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,775
There is not much time left to compete

77
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:29,560
Please, only this time

78
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,100
I know too

79
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:39,063
But don't the preparations cost a lot of money?

80
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:41,050
I won't wear make-up and I'll borrow clothes

81
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:42,931
for the last time

82
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,611
Really gonna be the last time please

83
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:59,023
Dad, just let me go this time

84
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:06,682
for the last time

85
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:09,280
I beg you

86
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:18,839
Mom

87
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:32,656
Mom

88
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:34,381
Hold this for a moment

89
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:47,428
I'll make you move in just one year

90
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:49,865
what do you say? It's annoying

91
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,375
my day sit down

92
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,379
For you...

93
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:07,948
If you take a humanities exam, you can enter this university

94
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:13,258
There are 5 months left for the exam

95
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:22,122
I'm worried that you're starting to learn arts too late

96
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,444
This is why I do my best in the academies

97
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:30,675
You don't take a tutoring class yet your grades shouldn't drop

98
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:31,850
You know, right?

99
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:33,380
Yes

100
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:02,831
daily

101
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:05,796
Do you really have to go to art school?

102
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:07,932
why do you want

103
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:10,238
Do you draw?

104
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,094
Ah, Master indeed!

105
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,548
How many times do I have to tell you?

106
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:17,827
art is beautiful

107
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,451
And I love pretty things

108
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,662
this is not true

109
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:23,774
This is just a lie

110
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:26,608
Look at this drawing

111
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,395
She's not pretty at all

112
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,471
I say this because I'm worried about you

113
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,764
You are good at studying

114
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:34,208
Do what you are good at doing

115
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:35,004
teacher

116
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:38,871
When I make up my mind to do something, I do it no matter what

117
00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:40,363
I've always been like this

118
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:43,608
Just worry about yourself

119
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:04,544
Are you done?

120
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,634
(Let's meet in the storage room at lunchtime)

121
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:21,487
- Bow to the teacher. - Thank you

122
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:54,390
get in

123
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:56,255
call me

124
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,787
see you tomorrow

125
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:06,427
Farewell

126
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,631
go faster

127
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:22,892
Since when?

128
00:12:30,677 --> 00:12:33,009
So did you even take first place in dating?

129
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,719
my day

130
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,321
The teacher asks you to go to the counseling room

131
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,652
I feel jealous

132
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:48,128
did you call me

133
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,000
daily

134
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:05,338
You have to answer my question clearly

135
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,917
Were you dating the music teacher?

136
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:12,896
Many people have seen you

137
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:15,403
The music teacher told us everything

138
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,745
It is common for a student to like her teacher

139
00:13:20,226 --> 00:13:21,063
but

140
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:24,556
There is a real relationship between the two of you

141
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:27,040
cause a big problem

142
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:29,380
I do not know

143
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:32,036
What are you talking about

144
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:33,635
You rude my day!

145
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:37,882
We spoiled you because you are good at studying but how dare you raise your head so rudely

146
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,543
Master Kim

147
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:44,595
A police report has already been received

148
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:46,595
So we can't handle the problem ourselves

149
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:50,175
We have to put things in order before the education office and the police come

150
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:51,612
teacher

151
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:53,568
I am sorry

152
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:56,792
I'm really sorry

153
00:13:58,118 --> 00:13:58,832
I

154
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,768
Just treat her nicely

155
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,841
But Yumi is the one who got close to me first

156
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:06,985
I had to turn it down I'm sorry

157
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:10,741
I am sorry

158
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:14,030
What do you mean close to you?

159
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:17,726
that's not true

160
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,644
why do you lie?

161
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:21,334
Damn, you!

162
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:24,489
Won't you shut up?

163
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,135
How do you interfere in adult talk, you are so arrogant

164
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:32,273
I am sorry

165
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:08,693
You should eat regularly and not get sick

166
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,714
How about that bastard?

167
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:40,800
Why wasn't he fired from his job?

168
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:44,762
Why do I have to run at dawn?

169
00:15:58,931 --> 00:16:01,634
Our school does not accept disciplinary transfer students

170
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:03,314
I beg you

171
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:07,996
There are only four months left until exams and everyone is sensitive

172
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,376
What if your daughter caused a problem?

173
00:16:10,376 --> 00:16:12,188
This won't happen

174
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,743
My daughter is really good at studying

175
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,525
Last month, it took second place in the SAT . assessment

176
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,787
In the previous semester, I got first place at the level of all schools

177
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,546
come here

178
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:43,998
my day

179
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,998
You only have four months

180
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:49,529
Don't try to make friends and focus on your studies quietly

181
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:51,365
Did you understand?

182
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:53,089
yes

183
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:57,428
You wanted to go to university here

184
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,497
Think of it like you moved to Seoul earlier than expected

185
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:04,354
Your new class teacher looks cute

186
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:05,899
is not it?

187
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:08,806
University entrance exams coming soon

188
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,494
bear a little

189
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:21,069
Buy the school uniform and the rest of your needs with this money

190
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:27,350
I'll just leave

191
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:52,789
My Father

192
00:17:57,983 --> 00:17:59,606
I'm sorry

193
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:03,580
call us

194
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:48,798
I'll tell you this again

195
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:50,610
But this exam is of a very easy level

196
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:52,378
You all got high marks

197
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:53,359
But don't be too happy about it

198
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:57,770
You have to subtract 30 points from the score to find your true score

199
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:06,762
my day

200
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:37,475
Sorry, your name is not on the accepted list

201
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:46,827
daily

202
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:49,758
You just got a call from Hongchun

203
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:00,236
hi dad

204
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,091
Why didn't you call once?

205
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,091
Your mother is worried

206
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,343
I was working on vacation

207
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:08,468
I was busy

208
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,146
People these days wear ready-made suits

209
00:20:13,196 --> 00:20:15,196
It seems that regular customers are becoming less for this reason

210
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,389
What about my mom?

211
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:18,608
how is she?

212
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:23,478
We went to the hospital yesterday

213
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:25,769
Doctors doubt

214
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:28,987
She has dementia

215
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:31,624
What?

216
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:33,833
dementia

217
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:35,960
can you come

218
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:38,529
in the weekend?

219
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:45,758
sorry

220
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:48,244
There is nothing wrong

221
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:52,257
You don't have to come if you still hate meeting people

222
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:55,930
وبالمناسبة ...

223
00:20:57,023 --> 00:21:04,174
Admission results haven't come out yet, right?

224
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:20,246
I was accepted into the university

225
00:21:20,683 --> 00:21:21,839
truly?

226
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,604
You did well my daughter

227
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,573
Everyone is wondering but I got worried because I didn't hear any news from you

228
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,687
Yumi's mother

229
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,687
I accepted my day at university

230
00:21:31,687 --> 00:21:32,187
accepted

231
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:34,701
You should have called right away, brat

232
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:36,439
It's not a great thing

233
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:37,973
What are you saying?

234
00:21:39,154 --> 00:21:40,676
You worked hard on your own

235
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:43,093
I will call you later

236
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,718
my day congratulations

237
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,899
You were so quiet I didn't know it

238
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:54,892
Tell me if you want to eat something I will cook it for you

239
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:11,048
My Father

240
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:12,470
I am here

241
00:22:22,492 --> 00:22:23,986
The welcome party is over

242
00:22:23,986 --> 00:22:25,186
We're too late

243
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:28,141
Your mom got dizzy on the way, so we're late

244
00:22:28,316 --> 00:22:29,690
It's okay, nothing important happened

245
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:31,983
Mom, are you dizzy?

246
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:36,113
I vomited at the rest stop I'm sorry

247
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:38,175
it is a gift

248
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:42,401
Kids these days all have the same

249
00:22:44,544 --> 00:22:45,976
But it is expensive

250
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:47,000
What are you talking about?

251
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,219
We should always do the best for our daughter

252
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:52,629
Help yourself

253
00:22:52,891 --> 00:22:53,994
This is expensive

254
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:58,285
She did well in her exams and got accepted into the university because you took good care of her

255
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,222
I don't know how to thank you

256
00:23:01,023 --> 00:23:04,622
My day is very humble and calm so I should be grateful

257
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:05,326
truly?

258
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:06,276
Yes

259
00:23:07,107 --> 00:23:09,416
Thank you

260
00:23:19,387 --> 00:23:22,342
I want to enroll in a college preparatory class

261
00:23:22,342 --> 00:23:24,167
Is this your first time?

262
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:24,811
yes

263
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:05,474
I heard from the aunt that you are a freshman student at our university

264
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:09,144
I'm Han Ji-won from Daegu, a second year in politics and diplomacy

265
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:10,432
I failed the first exam

266
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:11,432
What about you?

267
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:15,094
I

268
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,181
my day

269
00:24:20,936 --> 00:24:23,125
Are you going to hide everything?

270
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:30,000
We assign newcomers to the editorial department to write articles

271
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Are you interested in that?

272
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,012
I'm sorry, I've never tried that before

273
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:43,685
Farewell

274
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:48,207
Do we go together?

275
00:24:49,312 --> 00:24:52,516
They sell cold noodles in the cafeteria and they are very tasty, you have to try it

276
00:24:55,653 --> 00:24:56,866
give me your number

277
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:57,944
What?

278
00:24:57,944 --> 00:24:59,375
I'll give you my number in return

279
00:25:10,614 --> 00:25:11,340
my day

280
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:17,308
That building is the culture building and the editorial office on the second floor

281
00:25:21,113 --> 00:25:22,088
Welcome

282
00:25:22,306 --> 00:25:24,087
I'll go first

283
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:24,688
See you soon

284
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:27,553
be safe with you

285
00:25:27,553 --> 00:25:29,553
If you are bored, come spend some time

286
00:26:05,718 --> 00:26:08,148
(Come to the editing room, I'll invite you over for pizza)

287
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:15,038
eat a lot

288
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:16,493
Do not be ashamed of us and trust

289
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:19,424
Isn't it very cute?

290
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:22,027
She was so nervous when I first spoke to her

291
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,804
In fact

292
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:34,364
It's my first time eating with multiple people since I came here

293
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:35,976
truly?

294
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:38,851
So have you been eating alone this whole time? Without any companion?

295
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:39,351
Yes

296
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:42,984
Did you say you are from Hongchun?

297
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:45,733
I heard it's a good school district for our university

298
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:47,212
It belongs to Gangwon Province

299
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:48,403
Which school in Hongchun?

300
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:52,211
This is a misunderstanding of my relatives' house that is located in Hongchun

301
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,281
As for me, I studied abroad

302
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:58,265
truly?

303
00:26:58,265 --> 00:27:00,340
- Where abroad? - America

304
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:03,089
My dad runs a business there

305
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,316
What major are you studying?

306
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:17,541
Aesthetics

307
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,716
Originally, I was doing drawing but when I came back to Korea things didn't go well

308
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:29,775
Wear it and give it to new members for free

309
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:48,735
Stop it and put your hands above your heads

310
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,902
I'm not sure but I guess it's going to be hard with your grades

311
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:40,683
Welcome

312
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:42,790
Yumi, why can't I see you this while?

313
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,033
Did something happen?

314
00:28:45,214 --> 00:28:46,842
no just...

315
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:50,000
I was a bit busy

316
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:51,913
Understood

317
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,825
Are you going to the gathering tomorrow?

318
00:28:56,405 --> 00:28:57,225
gathering?

319
00:28:57,225 --> 00:28:59,122
Yes, Seoul University Gathering

320
00:28:59,122 --> 00:29:01,168
I told you last time

321
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:06,293
Welcome

322
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:07,798
It's been a long time

323
00:29:07,973 --> 00:29:10,367
I'm Han Ji Won from the editorial department

324
00:29:19,114 --> 00:29:20,876
hello it's my day

325
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:22,876
You are beautiful

326
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:28,923
As expected, our new member is so popular I'm so proud of her

327
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:12,936
What are you doing outside?

328
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:21,145
My head hurts because of the noise

329
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:27,005
How about we take a walk?

330
00:30:28,414 --> 00:30:29,823
If we walk in that direction we will find University Park

331
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:39,239
The weather is cold

332
00:31:08,204 --> 00:31:09,662
Welcome

333
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,418
Is this my day? Is this an everyday phone?

334
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:16,013
Yes, teacher, I am my day

335
00:31:17,204 --> 00:31:18,526
you naughty

336
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:20,863
Why didn't you come to receive your score report?

337
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,205
We announced the results a while ago

338
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,986
How many degrees did you get?

339
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,202
Your grade is worse than last year

340
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:34,682
But Yumi, are you determined to enter that university?

341
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,332
Can't you give up your desires and stay at a university in Seoul?

342
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:39,338
Don't put pressure on yourself, it's hard

343
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,975
Your pride won't help you

344
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,554
Do you need help?

345
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:05,483
Just help me put it on my back

346
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:09,357
Will I be able to walk around with this bag?

347
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,316
Where are you going?

348
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,603
Backpacking trip to Europe

349
00:32:14,134 --> 00:32:17,247
I think I will fall at this rate

350
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:18,359
a trip?

351
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,165
What about the university?

352
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:21,487
I stopped my lessons since last week

353
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:24,100
That's why I work as a private tutor

354
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:27,110
What are you going to do on vacation?

355
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:51,723
I would hate for someone to touch my things without my permission

356
00:32:54,536 --> 00:32:56,168
He was just by my side...

357
00:32:56,468 --> 00:32:57,810
But why do you carry this with you everywhere?

358
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,434
For private lessons

359
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,766
I thought you weren't doing part-time work

360
00:33:07,915 --> 00:33:10,000
I want to go on a trip with the sweat of my brow

361
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:20,034
Next year

362
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:23,468
I will go to New York

363
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:25,935
New York?

364
00:33:25,935 --> 00:33:26,632
Yes

365
00:33:27,312 --> 00:33:28,342
It is a similar program for student exchange

366
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:31,267
I will spend my last year in another university

367
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:39,438
are you sad?

368
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,612
No, that's good for you

369
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:46,396
congratulations

370
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,271
Instead of going on a trip alone

371
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:57,396
How about we go to New York together?

372
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:01,681
together?

373
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:02,854
Yes

374
00:34:03,537 --> 00:34:06,567
You can study the language there while I go to university

375
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:10,431
My mom suggested it to me earlier

376
00:34:11,587 --> 00:34:14,010
To get married immediately after graduation and then travel abroad with my wife

377
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:18,165
She wants to meet you

378
00:34:26,492 --> 00:34:28,871
Why did you come without calling in advance?

379
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:31,148
If you called, I'd run to get you

380
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:37,858
My Father

381
00:34:38,523 --> 00:34:40,935
I have been selected for the Distinguished Student Scholarship

382
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:41,798
truly?

383
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,253
So will you receive a grant?

384
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,101
No, I will not receive a scholarship

385
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:50,329
But it's something better

386
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:50,829
language study mission

387
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:52,402
Will they give you a free mission?

388
00:34:54,415 --> 00:34:56,037
that's not true

389
00:34:56,649 --> 00:34:58,649
They just give me a chance

390
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:07,735
Everyone goes to study the language, it's a necessity

391
00:35:13,814 --> 00:35:14,446
My Father

392
00:35:16,545 --> 00:35:17,570
Help me only this time

393
00:35:19,013 --> 00:35:20,444
I really

394
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:22,532
I want to do well

395
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:26,172
An opportunity like this will never come again

396
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:33,966
From Incheon Airport to New York Airport for passengers Kang Jae Ho and Lee Yomi

397
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,715
I'm going to go get some coffee, wait here

398
00:36:02,782 --> 00:36:03,527
Hello mother

399
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:10,832
My Father

400
00:36:11,882 --> 00:36:13,095
I'm leaving soon

401
00:36:14,888 --> 00:36:16,328
what do you say? speak slowly

402
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:17,134
daily

403
00:36:18,096 --> 00:36:19,043
That girl is fake

404
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,562
Everything is fake

405
00:36:22,355 --> 00:36:24,590
Your father asked his acquaintances

406
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:26,140
And searched for its information in every university

407
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,802
But he did not find a student named Lee Yomi at that university

408
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,500
What?

409
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:32,966
do you hear me?

410
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,788
They said it's not in their university

411
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:43,394
Where did you meet such a girl?

412
00:36:50,187 --> 00:36:51,645
You haven't boarded the plane yet, right?

413
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:54,382
I'm back at the airport

414
00:36:57,202 --> 00:36:57,702
What about my mom?

415
00:37:27,265 --> 00:37:29,515
- Hey... - How dare you lie like that

416
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:34,124
If you call Jay Ho again, I'll...

417
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,875
Hello mother

418
00:38:03,622 --> 00:38:05,725
I'm late calling you, right?

419
00:38:06,337 --> 00:38:07,506
I was so busy

420
00:38:07,506 --> 00:38:09,768
I didn't realize a week had passed

421
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:14,486
Mom

422
00:38:14,986 --> 00:38:15,748
What's wrong with your voice?

423
00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:18,251
Mom give the phone to dad

424
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:19,727
Today I am the aunt who lives next to you

425
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,011
Auntie, where is my father?

426
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:23,617
Don't be surprised

427
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:27,228
Your father has passed away

428
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:29,757
It collapsed last night

429
00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:32,073
He passed away this morning

430
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,589
Aunty, what are you saying?

431
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,969
can you come

432
00:38:42,648 --> 00:38:44,163
He had cancer

433
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,497
He wanted to tell you before you go to America

434
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,283
But he couldn't

435
00:38:54,076 --> 00:38:55,834
Afraid to stand in your way

436
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:08,591
right Now

437
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:13,315
I'll really try to live

438
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:19,705
Sorry about everything

439
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:29,317
Can we sell our suits to you?

440
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:34,431
Even if we sell it cheap?

441
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:40,648
okay I understand

442
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:11,666
Auntie, if someone comes to buy the suits, let me know right away

443
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:13,759
I will send you my mom's allowance every month

444
00:41:14,234 --> 00:41:17,183
Don't worry about your mom, she better stay here with me

445
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:19,478
Just mind your own business

446
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:25,550
Don't worry, I'll call you often

447
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:28,807
Farewell

448
00:41:30,229 --> 00:41:30,868
Bye mom

449
00:41:44,393 --> 00:41:45,875
sorry

450
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:49,694
take care of yourself

451
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:50,925
daily

452
00:42:52,094 --> 00:42:53,438
I'm coming

453
00:43:04,068 --> 00:43:05,634
(Job offer at Mary's company - educational background is not important)

454
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:12,378
Why do you keep bringing strangers here?

455
00:44:14,657 --> 00:44:15,537
This makes me feel uncomfortable

456
00:44:19,384 --> 00:44:20,910
Did you graduate in the same year with me?

457
00:44:21,479 --> 00:44:22,485
you know

458
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:25,272
I didn't actually go to school

459
00:44:31,175 --> 00:44:32,442
Are you still waiting?

460
00:44:42,366 --> 00:44:43,150
ah right

461
00:44:44,135 --> 00:44:45,120
You were waiting for me, right?

462
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:48,251
Tell dad you're going to work hard

463
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:49,873
Then he will accept you immediately

464
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:54,351
where is my father?

465
00:44:55,142 --> 00:44:57,639
He went to an event

466
00:44:58,601 --> 00:45:00,151
He said he would be late

467
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:02,735
So do the interview and make the decision

468
00:45:03,172 --> 00:45:03,786
I'm going out

469
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:04,738
I?

470
00:45:04,738 --> 00:45:06,681
And what's wrong with that? I will tell dad

471
00:45:16,127 --> 00:45:18,313
The business is a little different here because the family runs it

472
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,499
If you don't want to work, tell me right away

473
00:45:22,117 --> 00:45:22,631
Good

474
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:26,949
The president is a citizen of this neighborhood

475
00:45:28,086 --> 00:45:30,348
Everyone calls him a designer

476
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:35,234
You just graduated from high school

477
00:45:36,162 --> 00:45:36,662
Yes

478
00:45:39,644 --> 00:45:41,835
I will pass the matter; Because the junior principal chose you

479
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:43,906
Did you hear instructions from Secretary Kim?

480
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:48,334
Be careful with your words and don't be late or absent from work without an excuse

481
00:45:49,821 --> 00:45:50,534
Good

482
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,634
You should stick to the junior manager's side and make her comfortable

483
00:45:55,134 --> 00:45:58,389
What matters most to me is punctuality

484
00:46:01,353 --> 00:46:02,174
Can you do it?

485
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:09,781
All the furniture here is imported from abroad, made by international designers

486
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:12,640
They are precious

487
00:46:13,176 --> 00:46:15,461
This chair alone costs 15 million won

488
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:22,244
This is the Olive Garden group and is run by the president's wife

489
00:46:24,256 --> 00:46:26,233
They call her the senior manager

490
00:46:26,452 --> 00:46:28,396
You do church meetings here

491
00:46:39,825 --> 00:46:41,644
Thank you Lord

492
00:46:43,174 --> 00:46:45,535
The one I saw a while ago is the junior principal

493
00:46:45,535 --> 00:46:47,535
She is the president's daughter

494
00:46:47,921 --> 00:46:49,400
I bought this

495
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,331
She's reckless because she's the only daughter

496
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:54,793
She returned last year from America and opened her own store

497
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:59,010
You will most likely be working in the store

498
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:02,301
You will be performing personal errands for the junior principal

499
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,701
At first I only came to work part time

500
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,156
But this place is better than the rest of the part-time jobs

501
00:47:15,424 --> 00:47:17,804
They provide you with comprehensive primary insurance

502
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,320
Mom

503
00:47:31,704 --> 00:47:35,275
Now I have comprehensive insurance so don't worry and go to the hospital regularly

504
00:47:35,581 --> 00:47:36,081
Good?

505
00:47:38,384 --> 00:47:39,638
If you understand, beep twice

506
00:47:48,778 --> 00:47:50,501
But I don't like doctors

507
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:51,374
Of the

508
00:47:52,124 --> 00:47:54,055
He's not just a doctor

509
00:47:54,555 --> 00:47:57,801
He's someone who will inherit his father's hospital and his mother's gallery as well

510
00:47:58,151 --> 00:47:59,460
This is not attractive

511
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:01,522
Its benefits will attract you

512
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:03,768
Don't talk too long

513
00:48:03,768 --> 00:48:07,299
Later the director of the hospital will come, I will call you and enter normally

514
00:48:07,561 --> 00:48:09,023
And salute her

515
00:48:11,779 --> 00:48:16,066
I can see all of your body

516
00:48:20,823 --> 00:48:21,863
daily

517
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,534
yes

518
00:48:24,796 --> 00:48:27,483
Go to Hyun Joo's house and get her some clothes

519
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:31,757
Get something to cover her body

520
00:50:59,611 --> 00:51:05,243
She was painting in New York and participated in the Asia Art Gallery

521
00:51:05,243 --> 00:51:07,243
She returned to Korea last year

522
00:51:08,772 --> 00:51:10,101
oh her beauty

523
00:51:10,363 --> 00:51:11,384
I only have three kids

524
00:51:11,384 --> 00:51:13,101
So I envy those who have a daughter

525
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:17,735
Now I know why people around me praise her

526
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,284
Oh my God, is this true?

527
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,716
This is the first time I'm hearing this

528
00:51:24,022 --> 00:51:26,634
My God, who said that about her?

529
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:29,383
Good talk must be circulated among adults

530
00:52:22,868 --> 00:52:24,747
Welcome

531
00:52:28,246 --> 00:52:30,901
It's the day to deliver documents to the president

532
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:34,347
that stairs

533
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:40,334
I just have to give him the documents, right?

534
00:52:40,946 --> 00:52:43,000
Yes, the rest of the things are ready

535
00:52:44,646 --> 00:52:47,516
If you wanted to, you could even get a loan right away tomorrow

536
00:53:00,935 --> 00:53:07,507
Can you pass the store on your way back? My coat is the wrong size

537
00:53:08,425 --> 00:53:09,258
daily

538
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,234
This is an hour

539
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:19,386
It's a swiss brand, I've only worn it once

540
00:53:21,092 --> 00:53:22,457
Don't tell the rest of the staff

541
00:53:23,975 --> 00:53:25,056
leave

542
00:54:00,768 --> 00:54:03,059
Manager, I have arrived in front of the shop

543
00:54:03,434 --> 00:54:04,497
Have you already arrived?

544
00:54:04,716 --> 00:54:05,634
Why did you come so quickly?

545
00:54:06,385 --> 00:54:07,136
I didn't come so fast

546
00:54:08,186 --> 00:54:11,825
I'm not leaving now I met a friend I had the pleasure of meeting

547
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:13,912
Haven't you had dinner yet?

548
00:54:13,912 --> 00:54:14,731
come and eat

549
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,549
I'm good

550
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:27,923
I will not eat this

551
00:54:27,923 --> 00:54:32,578
Oh my God I'm so drunk I keep on speaking English

552
00:54:49,555 --> 00:54:52,459
They're the friends I used to hang out with in America

553
00:54:54,326 --> 00:54:57,155
They are teachers in Korea now

554
00:54:59,155 --> 00:55:02,686
They have no conscience

555
00:55:08,293 --> 00:55:09,483
That's warm

556
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:40,717
(Mom: I've learned how to write a letter. I miss you) (I'm coming to see you tomorrow)

557
00:55:40,717 --> 00:55:41,534
why tomorrow?

558
00:55:41,534 --> 00:55:42,867
Can't you do well from now on?

559
00:55:44,179 --> 00:55:47,371
Well, I'll do better

560
00:55:48,834 --> 00:55:49,510
go back to work

561
00:56:02,801 --> 00:56:03,410
What is the matter?

562
00:56:04,724 --> 00:56:05,732
Do you have anything to say?

563
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:20,000
Can I take a break tomorrow?

564
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,520
My mom is coming from her town

565
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:34,854
Why

566
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:38,603
You make me look like a bad person

567
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:39,688
What?

568
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,468
Don't you remember the terms of work I told you about?

569
00:56:45,525 --> 00:56:46,264
this is not true

570
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:49,139
I didn't think about it well

571
00:56:49,401 --> 00:56:50,688
Don't change the subject

572
00:56:53,085 --> 00:56:57,013
Is it because you know so much about me that you think I'm a joke?

573
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,601
Why don't you keep your promise?

574
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,363
Do you know what your problem is?

575
00:57:14,413 --> 00:57:18,600
You are lazy and stupid and yet you want to do everything other people do

576
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:22,657
Do you want to live your whole life like this?

577
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,492
Book me a flight

578
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:54,673
I will travel next Wednesday and I will stop for one day in Paris

579
00:57:54,673 --> 00:57:56,179
I will spend a week in Helsinki

580
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,604
Helsinki?

581
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,473
Yes, I want to go to the sauna because it's cold and I feel depressed

582
00:58:12,649 --> 00:58:13,854
Aren't you pathetic?

583
00:58:17,178 --> 00:58:17,716
What?

584
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:22,811
Happiness is a mysterious thing

585
00:58:23,715 --> 00:58:25,494
But the unhappiness is so obvious

586
00:58:27,866 --> 00:58:29,276
This period, I feel miserable

587
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:33,036
Welcome

588
00:58:36,797 --> 00:58:39,791
If it's a Hilton resort, I have a membership there

589
00:58:46,134 --> 00:58:50,000
I can't, if my mom knew that she would kill me

590
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:01,350
Tell mom I went with a friend

591
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:04,184
do not worry

592
00:59:04,927 --> 00:59:07,900
I met him at a gathering but our relationship is not serious

593
00:59:09,344 --> 00:59:12,843
Why would I worry about you?

594
00:59:18,484 --> 00:59:19,534
I feel hungry

595
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,731
Is my mom there?

596
00:59:37,918 --> 00:59:39,034
What is the matter?

597
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:41,845
There is a month left until the passport expires

598
00:59:44,529 --> 00:59:45,801
behave yourself

599
00:59:52,182 --> 00:59:54,182
Don't you know how to handle these things on your own?

600
00:59:57,287 --> 00:59:58,173
Good

601
00:59:58,673 --> 00:59:59,435
Get it sorted out urgently

602
01:00:02,441 --> 01:00:05,067
Shall I teach you how to go about things in detail?

603
01:00:06,493 --> 01:00:07,132
no

604
01:00:14,742 --> 01:00:16,102
It really gets on my nerves
