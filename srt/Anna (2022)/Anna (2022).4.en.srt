2
00:00:07,517 --> 00:00:08,877
It has always been like that.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,881
I always do everything I set my mind to.

00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:23,526
SEOUL MAYOR CANDIDATE CHOI JI-HOON
AND HIS WIFE PROFESSOR LEE ANNA

5
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:24,931
Is this Lee Yu-mi?

6
00:00:25,014 --> 00:00:26,661
EPISODE 4

7
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:27,717
Yes.

8
00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:31,217
I didn't want things to be awkward,
so I never brought her up.

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,475
I'm not going to live in Korea anyway

10
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:39,747
so it doesn't matter what she does.

11
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:44,454
But I thought I should tell you
why I broke up with her.

12
00:00:44,537 --> 00:00:47,454
Jae-ho, let bygones be bygones.

13
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:48,910
It's not that, Ji-won.

14
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:54,188
Lee Yu-mi

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,860
didn't go to your school.

16
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,164
What?

17
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:04,950
I have no idea how she graduated
from NYU and Yale

18
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:07,069
to become a professor

19
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:11,281
but she was a fake university student
when we were dating.

20
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:12,712
She was preparing for her SATs
a third time.

21
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,744
Lee Anna?

22
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:19,968
I don't trust that name either.

23
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,937
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:39,848
What is it? Can't do it?

25
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:49,139
To be honest, if he becomes the mayor,

26
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:51,874
he'll lift the constraints
on green belts first, right?

27
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,132
That shouldn't happen.

28
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:58,011
Pardon?

29
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,679
Nothing.

30
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:06,530
It shouldn't be the green belts
he works on first.

31
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:09,205
We need to keep
the public opinion in mind.

32
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,894
Of course. Things must be done in order.

33
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,585
But we believe in him.

34
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:21,700
We got that land as inheritance
and it's been such a nuisance.

35
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:23,843
You know, inheritance tax.

36
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:29,420
You never know what will happen, right?

37
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:35,212
If you had to pay inheritance tax,
the land must be over 700 million won.

38
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:38,529
You shouldn't put it like that.

39
00:03:40,635 --> 00:03:44,125
Those who work at a convenience store
on an hourly wage still pay their taxes.

40
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:49,394
Come on. I'm just saying.

41
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:52,211
He needs to get elected first.

42
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:56,137
Just as you said,

43
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:59,425
you never know what will happen.

44
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:02,689
By the way,

45
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:06,912
I sent my kid to the UK to study.

46
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:11,261
I thought of you
when we went there last week

47
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:16,539
to drop him off at the dormitory.

48
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:19,619
What is it?

49
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:22,426
It's nothing much.
I don't mean anything by it.

50
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:26,051
I'm sure you have more beautiful
and precious stuff,

51
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:29,279
but this is a gift from my heart
so please accept it.

52
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,044
I'll pick up the bill.

53
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:35,420
Take your time.

54
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,867
Yes.

55
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,902
She's young, but very stubborn.

56
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:01,984
Not once
did she look at me with warm eyes.

57
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:03,440
She's super rude.

58
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,477
Do you think so?
Is it because she lived abroad?

59
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:12,685
Maybe she doesn't know much about Korea.

60
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:03,916
It's about 100 million won.

61
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:06,811
It's the best I can do.

62
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:17,050
Yu-mi.

63
00:06:21,362 --> 00:06:25,251
Everything in this world
is possible with money.

64
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:27,617
But if something's not possible,

65
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:32,153
you should ask yourself
if it's because there wasn't enough.

66
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:37,856
Hey. Don't be so disappointed.

67
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,733
You still have time.

68
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,140
I know you're smart.

69
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:46,715
Or you should just confess to your husband
and ask for some money.

70
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:51,651
Should I call him for you?

71
00:06:57,744 --> 00:06:59,624
You know I'm impatient, right?

72
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:04,611
Make sure you meet the deadline.

73
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:15,186
Right, Yu-mi!

74
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:22,579
Stay out of my sight
and use the stairs, will you?

75
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:32,345
The door's opening.

76
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,682
LEE ANNA, DONGJIN UNIVERSITY

77
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:43,426
SEOUL MAYOR CANDIDATE CHOI JI-HOON'S WIFE
PROFESSOR LEE ANNA

78
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:46,529
PROFESSOR LEE ANNA UNEXPECTEDLY INTERPRETS
SIGN LANGUAGE AT THE SCHOLARSHIP CEREMONY

79
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,737
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

80
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:59,927
You lived in America, so why are you
going back to study English?

81
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,995
My question exactly.

82
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:02,870
No, I still have a long way to go.

83
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:04,692
I'm so jealous.

84
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,620
I'm the most jealous about her parents

85
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,498
letting her go with her boyfriend.

86
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:09,531
Same.

87
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,879
They tend to be open-minded

88
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:14,009
since they live abroad.

89
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:15,363
You're so lucky.

90
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:18,595
Will you get married after graduating?

91
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:19,859
Really?

92
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,994
No way.

93
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:24,064
Yes.

94
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:25,175
Really?

95
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:27,862
-I'll sing at your wedding.
-I'm so jealous.

96
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:29,849
Okay. I'll be the MC.

97
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:31,834
Did you hand in your leave of absence?
When are you leaving?

98
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,906
In one week.

99
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:35,894
Which school will you go to?

100
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:38,736
I'll probably attend
the same one as Jae-ho.

101
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,580
-Columbia?
-Columbia?

102
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:42,252
The tuition must be crazy expensive.

103
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,429
-Really?
-Yes, it's in New York.

104
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:45,868
Wait, guys.

105
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,926
We all pitched in to get this.

106
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:56,013
What is it?

107
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:57,490
-Open it.
-It's nothing much.

108
00:08:57,573 --> 00:09:00,465
I'm already so thankful
that you prepared a goodbye party.

109
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:02,824
Isn't it pretty? Aren't we thoughtful?

110
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:04,489
-It's the scent that's important.
-Take a sniff.

111
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:05,465
Isn't it pretty?

112
00:09:05,548 --> 00:09:07,388
-Put it on.
-Hurry, hurry.

113
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:22,084
Hello. I'm Reporter Han Ji-won
from Bokuk Daily

114
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,949
and I'm an alumna.

115
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:27,470
Yes. I called because

116
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:30,931
I want to know how I can look up
previously admitted students.

117
00:09:32,677 --> 00:09:35,068
No. Not a graduate,
but someone who was admitted.

118
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:38,416
There were seven people

119
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:41,342
in the 10 years between 1995 and 2005

120
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:43,933
with the name Lee Yu-mi.

121
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,228
But no one was in Aesthetics.

122
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:51,551
Could I ask you to check one more person?

123
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,054
-Sure.
-Lee Anna.

124
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,296
Can I also check
if she ever took a year off?

125
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,623
Sure, one moment please.

126
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:28,393
Ma'am.

127
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,709
Look who it is.

128
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:33,963
Do you remember me?

129
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:36,707
Of course I recognize you, Ji-won.

130
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,535
We lived together for four years.

131
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:40,804
Are you done with the boarding house?

132
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:44,067
Yes. The world changed.
I manage studio apartments now.

133
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,048
Studio apartments.

134
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:47,295
We built it three years ago.

135
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:50,836
Wow, you're a landlord. I envy you.

136
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:54,965
Lee Yu-mi? Of course I know her.

137
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:57,298
I'd never be able to forget her.

138
00:10:58,008 --> 00:10:59,088
Why not?

139
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:00,742
When she moved out,

140
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:04,281
she ran away without paying me
the rent for the last two months.

141
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:06,316
She ran away?

142
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,148
She was behind by two months,

143
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:11,315
but she didn't come home for days.

144
00:11:11,398 --> 00:11:12,955
She wouldn't pick up her phone either.

145
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:15,555
I called her parents back home and learned

146
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:19,160
that she had left for the US
without telling me.

147
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:21,960
She left all her belongings behind too.

148
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:27,063
When I cleaned out her room,
I found so many clothes.

149
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,623
I went all the way to Gangwon-do then

150
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:35,446
to get the two months of rent

151
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,574
and my transportation fare
from her father.

152
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:40,181
Where in Gangwon-do? Do you remember it?

153
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:41,978
Hongcheon.

154
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:42,959
Hongcheon...

155
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:45,374
I remember because it was where my son
went for his army service.

156
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:47,570
They ran a tailor's shop
at the entrance of the market.

157
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:49,428
The market?

158
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:52,715
When I visited them,
things didn't look so good.

159
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:55,624
They were really devoted
to supporting their daughter.

160
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:59,284
They always sent me a melon
every Thanksgiving.

161
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:01,972
It was very expensive back then.

162
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:06,087
Oh. Melon...

163
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,097
You still have time.

164
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:42,859
Or you should just confess to your husband
and ask for some money.

165
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:44,844
Should I call him for you?

166
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:54,518
Wow, Choi Ji-hoon.

167
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:57,757
Isn't it considered cheating to found
a scholarship foundation at this time?

168
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:00,371
-What is it?
-Take a look.

169
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:03,185
PROFESSOR LEE ANNA TO ESTABLISH
A NON-PROFIT SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION

170
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:10,494
NURI SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION'S FIRST EVENT
AT THE SEOUL ART HALL ON JANUARY 17

171
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:15,639
She was a well-dressed instructor
who was also friendly.

172
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:17,406
That's why the kids liked her.

173
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:19,409
How did her students do with admissions?

174
00:13:20,054 --> 00:13:22,152
Let me see...

175
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:26,315
1 went to Yale, 2 went to CalArts,

176
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:29,867
1 went to Chicago, and 3 to SUB.

177
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,996
She sent one to the UK too.

178
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,356
She sent quite a few of them. 8 or 9?

179
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:40,025
Did you find anything out of the ordinary?

180
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:48,605
Ms. Lee's English wasn't that great.

181
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,626
Her British accent was strange.

182
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:56,180
Did she have a British accent?

183
00:13:56,263 --> 00:13:57,442
Yes.

184
00:13:57,525 --> 00:14:01,327
Sometimes my students
aren't so good in Korean,

185
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,716
so I heard her speak English.
But her accent was a little weird.

186
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:09,783
Hey.

187
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:14,157
Do you hold onto degree certificates?

188
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,287
Forty two.

189
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,463
MADAM BOO HYUN-JIN
MRS. LEE WON-HYUNG

190
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:29,643
Three, four...

191
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:31,907
Forty five.

192
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:50,492
-Hello.
-Welcome.

193
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,677
Please take me to Hongseong Market.

194
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,475
-"Hongseong Market"?
-Yes.

195
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:57,588
Not the New Hongcheon Market?

196
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:59,603
No, Hongseong Market. What is it?

197
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:03,997
There's nothing there anymore
because they're building a train station.

198
00:15:04,523 --> 00:15:06,035
It's just a field now.

199
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:12,239
I'm trying to look for someone who used to
have a shop at Hongseong Market.

200
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:14,288
You should go to New Hongcheon Market.

201
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,999
Everyone who used to run shops there
all moved to New Hongcheon Market.

202
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,488
Really? Can you take me there?

203
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:22,767
Okay.

204
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:24,792
Yes.

205
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:29,873
Mrs. Kim told me.

206
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,066
Yes.

207
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,355
Really? I didn't know.

208
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,219
Yes.

209
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:41,203
Should we?

210
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,483
I have some time in the afternoon.

211
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:49,411
Sure, Hannam-dong would be nice.

212
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,253
Okay, I got it. Bye.

213
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:18,487
Thank you for making the time
when you're so busy.

214
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,203
The election is so soon.

215
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:23,236
It was my pleasure.

216
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:24,548
I'll see you again next time.

217
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:26,700
Sure. Let's meet more often now.

218
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:28,436
Okay. I'll get going.

219
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,105
Please go ahead.

220
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,913
-Did you do what I asked?
-Yes.

221
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:46,830
-I'll bring your car.
-Okay.

222
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:52,059
Hey, it's me.

223
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:53,961
I'm in Hannam-dong right now.

224
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:57,007
We just parted ways.
She wasn't rude to me at all.

225
00:16:57,924 --> 00:17:00,199
No, she's super charming.

226
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,911
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

227
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:34,955
TTANGJIB RESTAURANT

228
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:43,220
Hello.

229
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,244
Welcome.

230
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:04,606
I didn't order anything yet.

231
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:06,132
We only serve sundaeguk in the morning.

232
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:09,292
Okay. I'll enjoy it.

233
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:12,663
You look like you're from Seoul.

234
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:14,922
Do I look like I'm from Seoul?

235
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:18,033
All pretty girls tend to be from Seoul.

236
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:20,195
Thank you.

237
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:30,844
Has it been long
since you ran your business here?

238
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:31,956
Me?

239
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:35,660
Maybe 40 years? More or less?

240
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:38,381
Were you at Hongseong Market too?

241
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:40,472
That's my hometown.

242
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:41,702
I see.

243
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,345
Do you know the tailor's there?

244
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:45,768
Baekma.

245
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:48,176
There was only one tailor's.

246
00:18:49,318 --> 00:18:50,385
Then,

247
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:57,787
do you know their daughter Lee Yu-mi?

248
00:18:58,177 --> 00:19:00,691
Of course. Hong-ju's daughter Yu-mi.

249
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:04,897
She's in the US right now.

250
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,951
Do you know Yu-mi?

251
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:15,928
She was a beautiful, popular,
and smart student.

252
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:19,000
It's what kids these days call
an attention seeker.

253
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,811
She was a bit like that.

254
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:24,624
She liked getting attention.

255
00:19:25,271 --> 00:19:27,017
I see.

256
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:30,520
And then

257
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:33,682
during her senior year of high school,

258
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:37,801
she dated one of the younger teachers.

259
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:41,561
That became a huge problem.

260
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:43,477
A teacher?

261
00:19:44,498 --> 00:19:45,438
Yes.

262
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:51,780
Do you know what happened after that?

263
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:54,797
After she transferred
to a school in Seoul,

264
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,364
she visited me out of the blue
in the middle of the night.

265
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:04,215
Come in.

266
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,998
She cried all night long

267
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:13,199
before she took
the first train back to Seoul.

268
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,343
That happened 2 or 3 times.

269
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:22,876
I didn't see her after that.

270
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:23,809
Are you okay?

271
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,446
-Teacher...
-Don't cry.

272
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:30,849
From my experience,

273
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:33,354
kids who grow up
with people telling them they're smart

274
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:37,298
become extremely vulnerable
when they think they're no longer useful.

275
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:40,764
I'm curious about her too.

276
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:44,612
I wonder what kind of person she became.

277
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:48,364
I see.

278
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:51,478
I'm sorry, but please let me take this.

279
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:53,000
-Sure.
-I'm sorry.

280
00:20:58,367 --> 00:20:59,545
Hello?

281
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:00,739
Hey, it's me.

282
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:02,741
Where have you been all day?

283
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:05,100
You need to meet
Candidate Choi Ji-hoon tonight.

284
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:06,412
Make sure to clear time for it.

285
00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:10,160
Yes, but I'm currently out of the province
to gather news material.

286
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:12,167
Could Reporter Hwang go instead?

287
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:15,337
I know, and it's good
that you're working hard.

288
00:21:15,803 --> 00:21:18,667
But you should at least thank the person
who got you this job,

289
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,884
don't you think?

290
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,691
Pardon?

291
00:21:21,774 --> 00:21:24,513
It's at 7:00 p.m.
I'll text you the location.

292
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:26,498
-Don't say anything ridiculous to him.
-Sir.

293
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:29,059
Don't be late. He hates it the most.

294
00:21:29,463 --> 00:21:31,061
I'm going into a meeting.
Talk to you later.

295
00:21:34,852 --> 00:21:37,157
What is he saying?

296
00:21:39,746 --> 00:21:42,546
How many times
do I have to come to the airport?

297
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:45,010
He doesn't do a single thing right.

298
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,630
The flight was delayed.

299
00:21:49,713 --> 00:21:51,564
So what?

300
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:54,690
Is it that difficult
to tell me it got delayed

301
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:57,131
and update me the right time?

302
00:21:57,214 --> 00:22:00,146
He didn't do it on purpose.

303
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:04,324
And the divorce application is still
under progress. Don't be so cold to him.

304
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,675
Be friendly when you talk, okay?

305
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:09,417
I have nothing to say.

306
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,958
Hyun-joo, please listen to me.

307
00:22:16,076 --> 00:22:18,649
It's not too late to change your mind--

308
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:19,789
Mom.

309
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,409
You know I never had anything

310
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:28,526
I cherished so much in my life before.

311
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,686
But now I have something like that too.

312
00:22:34,347 --> 00:22:36,766
Something I cherish and adore to death.

313
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,150
She's all I need.

314
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:33,428
This is why
we're not meant for each other.

315
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:34,528
Do you get it?

316
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:50,000
<font color="#f5e100">❤️Join @ADrama_Lovers telegram channel for asian dramas❤️</font>

317
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,215
It snowed a lot, so...

318
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:55,351
I'm sorry.

319
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:59,158
Sure. It must've been difficult
to travel so far with a child.

320
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:00,938
This is Stella's stuff.

321
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:02,843
She's been suffering from eczema
for three months.

322
00:24:02,926 --> 00:24:04,225
Please pay extra attention to that.

323
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:06,213
Okay. Thank you.

324
00:24:06,772 --> 00:24:10,040
After mediation,
we won't have to see each other.

325
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:11,801
You should hire a lawyer

326
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,121
and then we just need to
figure out the custody.

327
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,342
I'll get going.

328
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:23,293
Hey. Ji-won.

329
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:25,377
Hello.

330
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,612
Long time no see.

331
00:24:30,242 --> 00:24:31,316
Please have a cup of tea.

332
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:39,877
I didn't know
I was hired through connections.

333
00:24:40,883 --> 00:24:42,334
Did it upset you?

334
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,312
Of course I wasn't happy.

335
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:46,308
Come on.

336
00:24:46,391 --> 00:24:48,243
I was a businessman once.

337
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:50,715
Just because someone asks for a favor,

338
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:53,162
doesn't mean I'll place people
wherever they want.

339
00:24:53,245 --> 00:24:55,184
You know I wrote two stories

340
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:59,415
last month on people who were hired
to public enterprises through connections.

341
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:03,636
I was only giving you a chance
since you had potential.

342
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,603
-Really?
-Yes.

343
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,607
What did you like so much about me?

344
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,124
Isn't it a dream
of every political journalist

345
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:14,697
to be able to enter the Blue House?

346
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,673
My dream isn't to become the Seoul mayor.
It's beyond that.

347
00:25:22,377 --> 00:25:25,966
I could've sent someone else

348
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:28,490
but since it's the first time,
I wanted to talk to you face to face.

349
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,251
What is this?

350
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:42,489
A gift.

351
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:44,770
It's a little gift from me.

352
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:49,713
It's a real estate registry.

353
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:53,923
Whose is it?

354
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:57,101
It belongs to Candidate Lee Jung-il
from the opposition party,

355
00:25:57,184 --> 00:25:58,537
who is marketing himself
as someone ordinary.

356
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:01,201
He's not ordinary.

357
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:05,233
It's an exclusive, and it's big too.

358
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:08,184
This...

359
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:10,521
What is it?

360
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:15,643
It's common for reporters
to get stories to write about

361
00:26:15,726 --> 00:26:18,505
over drinks with the aides
of the National Assembly,

362
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:23,714
but having you do this to me directly
really makes me uncomfortable.

363
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:26,437
Wait.

364
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,597
You're a contrarian.

365
00:26:33,077 --> 00:26:34,039
Right?

366
00:26:40,114 --> 00:26:41,415
Thanks for the compliment.

367
00:26:41,498 --> 00:26:45,460
Right. I like that.

368
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,693
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

369
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,821
Leave it here.

370
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,667
It'll be released as an exclusive
from Bokuk anyway.

371
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:01,795
But Ji-won,

372
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:03,786
you can't last long

373
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:06,034
if you work like that.

374
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:10,527
Nothing is as pathetic

375
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,206
as someone who is incompetent but proud.

376
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:17,471
In this line of work,
snatching the opportunity

377
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,279
is being competent.

378
00:27:21,922 --> 00:27:23,774
Just like Anna.

379
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,413
What kind of opportunity did she snatch?

380
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,471
She married me.

381
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:43,439
Right.

382
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:45,255
"Right."

383
00:27:47,602 --> 00:27:48,683
"Right."

384
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:54,366
Do you want a drink instead?

385
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,804
REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

386
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:55,521
NOTHING CAN BE AS EMPTY AS THE COURAGE
OF THE WEAK - JEONG DO-JEON

387
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:57,575
Scholar Jeong Do-jeon said this once.

388
00:28:57,658 --> 00:29:01,840
"Nothing can be as empty
as the courage of the weak."

389
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:05,733
"If you want to change the world,
become powerful first."

390
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:10,840
"If the world could change just from
a fuss from someone like you,

391
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:12,917
they wouldn't call this anarchy."

392
00:29:18,077 --> 00:29:19,252
Do you want me to write it down?

393
00:29:21,113 --> 00:29:24,137
Darn it. He's so annoying.

394
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,218
Here.

395
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:31,393
I want this one couriered in the morning
two days from now,

396
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,301
but send us the one
that was made on that day.

397
00:30:33,384 --> 00:30:34,404
Yes, Ma'am.

398
00:30:35,323 --> 00:30:37,388
-Can I add a message?
-Yes.

399
00:30:57,735 --> 00:31:00,046
Candidate Choi,
we hope to hear good news today.

400
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:01,806
Yes. Thank you.

401
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:04,438
Candidate Choi. It's only the beginning.

402
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:05,438
Yes, I know.

403
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:06,734
Don't worry and just charge forward.

404
00:31:06,817 --> 00:31:07,811
Yes, Sir.

405
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,643
Did you have a good dream last night?

406
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:14,428
My wife had a good dream.

407
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:15,713
Really?

408
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:18,868
All right. Choi Ji-hoon!

409
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:23,532
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

410
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:27,788
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

411
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,051
I'll be back.

412
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:33,878
With 3,216 votes,

413
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:37,160
making it 68.4 percent in favor,

414
00:32:37,243 --> 00:32:40,320
Choi Ji-hoon was elected as the candidate
to represent

415
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:42,510
the Democratic Republican Party
in the run for the Seoul mayor.

416
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:45,683
SEOUL MAYOR CANDIDATE ELECTION

417
00:32:45,937 --> 00:32:47,563
Congratulations. Congratulations.

418
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:53,941
Electoral college, please send him
your congratulatory applause.

419
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:58,989
Our proud candidate Choi Ji-hoon
was elected today

420
00:32:59,072 --> 00:33:02,909
and he'll repay you all
with an overwhelming victory.

421
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:07,095
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

422
00:33:07,178 --> 00:33:12,196
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

423
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,160
Wow. I expected it,

424
00:33:53,243 --> 00:33:54,981
but I didn't think he'd win by this much.

425
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:57,211
He even beat the one who was elected
four times.

426
00:33:58,752 --> 00:34:00,918
Everything's rigged anyway.

427
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:03,079
A reasonable suspicion.

428
00:34:03,162 --> 00:34:04,503
Where do you think the story

429
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:07,392
about the exceptional admission
for Assemblyman Min's son came from?

430
00:34:07,475 --> 00:34:09,102
You never cease to be curious.

431
00:34:09,691 --> 00:34:12,440
Meeting him gave me a hunch.

432
00:34:12,523 --> 00:34:16,855
Choi Ji-hoon is probably a jackpot
if we dig into him.

433
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:19,286
Don't even joke about that.

434
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:21,128
Dig into who?

435
00:34:21,211 --> 00:34:22,799
You'll get in trouble before you do that.

436
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,813
You're so fearless.

437
00:34:27,578 --> 00:34:28,950
I worry about you.

438
00:34:32,495 --> 00:34:34,228
Have a drink.

439
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:35,956
Oh! You're here.

440
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,329
He's here.

441
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:44,250
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

442
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,927
Professor Lee is here.

443
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:07,309
Lee Anna!

444
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,988
-Lee Anna!
-Is the best!

445
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:14,123
-Lee Anna!
-Is the best!

446
00:35:14,206 --> 00:35:18,344
-Lee Anna!
-Is the best!

447
00:35:35,209 --> 00:35:39,658
Darling, don't worry about a thing

448
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:46,002
Let's all sing together

449
00:35:55,898 --> 00:35:58,066
Congratulations, Professor Lee.

450
00:36:01,832 --> 00:36:04,357
If he gets out late,

451
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,123
just have him sleep in a hotel nearby.

452
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,305
Yes, Ma'am. I'll let you know.

453
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:12,246
No. Just let him sleep out.

454
00:36:13,716 --> 00:36:14,951
Yes, Ma'am.

455
00:36:16,732 --> 00:36:20,239
But if he wants to come home,
I'll contact you.

456
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,320
When do you sleep, Ms. Cho?

457
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,583
Well, today's a special day.

458
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,318
You had a long day.

459
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,338
Please rest.

460
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:59,318
The door's closing.

461
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,821
The door's opening.

462
00:37:50,023 --> 00:37:51,787
The door's closing.

463
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,130
Choi Ji-hoon!

464
00:37:56,213 --> 00:37:59,627
Let us

465
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,002
Sing together

466
00:38:03,085 --> 00:38:05,768
Say that it was a dream

467
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,038
Again!

468
00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:34,385
A cat?

469
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:38,608
Yes. Kids these days love cats.

470
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,559
You should keep one at our campaign camp.

471
00:38:41,642 --> 00:38:44,356
The public will make up their own story

472
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:47,738
and they'll give it a title too.

473
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:53,271
Then go ahead with it
as long as it doesn't get in the way.

474
00:38:53,354 --> 00:38:54,324
Yes, Sir.

475
00:38:54,962 --> 00:38:57,501
What should we name the cat?

476
00:38:57,584 --> 00:38:58,883
Is that necessary?

477
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:01,884
If you can just give us a name,

478
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,020
the PR office will post the news

479
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:06,210
about rescuing a stray cat
on social media.

480
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:09,180
Was it really rescued?

481
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,971
-No.
-No, Sir.

482
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:21,307
Seoul. Seoul.

483
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,260
Seoul.

484
00:39:27,385 --> 00:39:29,572
Seoul, Seoul, Seoul.

485
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,456
Seoul. Seoul.

486
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:36,473
Seo Woo-ri?

487
00:39:36,556 --> 00:39:38,739
It's Seoul. Seo Woo-ri.

488
00:39:38,822 --> 00:39:40,293
-The name?
-Seo Woo-ri.

489
00:39:40,376 --> 00:39:42,888
Seo Woo-ri. Call it Seo Woo-ri.

490
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:45,696
Post it as Woo-ri, and when they ask why,

491
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:47,467
you can say its full name is Seo Woo-ri.

492
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:50,221
-Post it as Woo-ri at first.
-Understood.

493
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,435
That's marvelous.

494
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:55,308
We mistook you, Professor Lee.

495
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:57,235
We didn't know you were so friendly.

496
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,898
I can understand.

497
00:40:00,553 --> 00:40:03,334
I should've paid everyone a visit first.

498
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:05,063
No, not at all.

499
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:07,203
There is no need to do that
just because you're younger.

500
00:40:08,024 --> 00:40:12,357
Actually, my daughter
is attending high school in Canada,

501
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,757
but I want her to attend
an American university.

502
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,388
I have a lot of questions.

503
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:17,369
Sure.

504
00:40:17,452 --> 00:40:19,077
Please give me some advice.

505
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,193
Of course.

506
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:25,014
Gosh, look at the time.

507
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:28,200
You can go first.

508
00:40:28,283 --> 00:40:30,442
I have another meeting here after.

509
00:40:31,494 --> 00:40:33,179
Then I better vacant this seat for you.

510
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:37,479
I better get going.
I have to pick up my other child.

511
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:40,537
See you another time.

512
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,872
Congratulations on the election.

513
00:40:42,835 --> 00:40:44,759
-Don't bother seeing me out.
-Okay.

514
00:40:59,765 --> 00:41:01,368
Why is it so easy?

515
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:08,471
Professor Lee.

516
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:12,604
Hello.

517
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:14,736
I'm not late, am I?

518
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:16,506
Not at all.

519
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,950
...471.4 billion won will be invested

520
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:22,964
on about 191,000
in the farming and fishing community...

521
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:24,966
Welcome.

522
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:29,077
Can I get something to help my digestion?

523
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,234
What's bothering you?

524
00:41:32,962 --> 00:41:36,817
I ate more than usual.

525
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,147
Did you overeat? One moment, please.

526
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,062
A woman in her 30s who was pessimistic
about her circumstances

527
00:41:42,145 --> 00:41:45,004
was found dead in her car.

528
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:47,390
Police say that the woman lit up
a charcoal briquette

529
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:49,572
in her car
before she lost consciousness...

530
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:50,695
It's 3,500 won.

531
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:53,561
A paperboy discovered her
and she was transferred to a hospital,

532
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,632
but it was after she had passed away.

533
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:59,767
It's speculated that Ms. Lee took
an extreme measure

534
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,038
due to the recent stock market crash
and her marriage problems.

535
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:03,537
Are you

536
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,501
Professor Lee Anna by any chance?

537
00:42:07,546 --> 00:42:08,385
I am.

538
00:42:08,468 --> 00:42:12,940
It's such an honor to have you here.

539
00:42:13,023 --> 00:42:15,456
Could I take a picture with you?
