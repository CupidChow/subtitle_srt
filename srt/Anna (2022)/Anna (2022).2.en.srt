This is my daily

Yes, my day

this means

22
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:13,979
That you were in America all that time?

23
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,741
Yes, I went to university there

So, are you back forever now?

Yes

I'm totally back

I'm back already but I don't know what to start with

But, even I don't know what to do

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,708
I wasn't accepted in any of the places I wanted

30
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:43,702
And the place I work at is very small

With that, you became a journalist as you wanted

Honestly, I hated my company a lot at first

But it doesn't matter how I got here

34
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,534
What am I going to do in the future? This is the real problem

35
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,069
So, what kind of work do you want to do?

36
00:03:05,296 --> 00:03:07,301
I have a lot of relationships I work for the alumni association now

No, I didn't call you to ask for a favor

Do you want to teach children as part-time work?

Someone with your qualifications will be fed up by people

What kind of business is this?

I know someone who runs an art academy

The academy is very big and famous

Are you going somewhere today?

Your educational background is excellent

Usually, people like you don't come to work in academies

It hasn't been long since I got back from America

54
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:54,854
I felt like I had to do something

55
00:04:55,356 --> 00:04:58,165
But I'm not used to the situation yet, and it's strange

56
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:01,452
Right, I heard a lot about you from Ji Won

57
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:05,535
But I have no experience

58
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:08,935
You have received theoretical and practical training and even have a master's degree

59
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:10,632
Your educational background is more than enough

60
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:15,620
To tell you the truth, the educational background of the lecturers is very important to us

61
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,917
I trust you because Ji Won introduced me to you

62
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:23,162
There are not many dedicated and hardworking people these days

When can you start working?

64
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:42,593
You have kept it well

00:05:46,703 --> 00:05:48,090

Did you buy it yourself?

No, I received it as a gift

Didn't you hear about it?

74
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,258
It was made in China and only screw was added in Switzerland

75

To say it was made there

76
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,420
It cost 100,000 won but they sold it for 8 or 10 million won

77
00:06:31,988 --> 00:06:35,091
If you just got it, who gave it to you, really bad person

My little brother is planning to study abroad so I'm doing research

Schools abroad are different from here, they are not about the best student

89

00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,260
They take into account that everyone has their own path

to find

Finding a new perspective on your own

00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:44,843
This is what universities definitely want

00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:49,693
Teachers want to know the story behind your artwork

I understand what you're saying

Just think of yourself

You got a high score on the placement test

Have you ever taken English lessons?

No, it's my first time going to an English academy

I have taken the TOEIC test before and got around 900 points

Nothing big but you should come soon

122

The market area will undergo redevelopment

And you will get compensation for your sewing shop

Do you miss me?

136
00:10:08,705 --> 00:10:10,671
It will take you half an hour to get to know you

137
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:13,524
She will keep thinking and asking herself who you are

138
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:21,501
You said this place was going to be a train station, right?

139
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:24,522
Yeah, do you know the road we used to use as a stop?

140
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:29,310
They will build a decent train station there

141
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:32,156
I brought you the documents from the union representative

142
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:43,837
Have you thought about what I told you about?

143
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:46,811
yes

144
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:48,531
Like I said

145
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:51,377
I think it's best to put her in a nursing home

146
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:53,882
You did well to think

147
00:10:55,262 --> 00:10:57,739
If I take a second, she could end up in big trouble

148
00:10:58,305 --> 00:10:59,552
with this money

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,908
You can get a wonderful apartment for rent in Seoul

150
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:03,908
is not it?

151
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,476
This is correct

152
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:21,442
Help yourself

153
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:28,126
I didn't know you had a guest

154
00:11:30,244 --> 00:11:34,025
This is Professor Yoon Soo Young, don't you know her? She is an older classmate of yours

155
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:35,546
Sorry?

156
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,543
This is the lecture I told you about

157
00:11:38,892 --> 00:11:40,000
She probably doesn't know me

158
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:43,066
Since I started school the year I graduated

159
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,211
Sorry I didn't recognize you

160
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:48,324
No need to apologize, sit here

161

have a seat

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,330
Rumors?

167
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:09,812
It was very popular

168
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,287
I don't remember if it was Pyeongchang District or Seongbuk District

169
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,530
In any case

170
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,301
It is said that she owns a lot of real estate

171
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:20,634
I figured she's not from an ordinary family by looking at her clothes

172
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,560
She was accepted due to her family's donations and her testimony was managed with money

173
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:28,257
She was a very popular party girl

174
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:31,480
That's why many of her colleagues don't even know her face

175
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:33,834
She didn't even go to reunions after she came back to Korea

176
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:39,566
But she is very hardworking

177
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,130
It's very good

178
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,470
That's surprising

179
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:47,444
She has money and a good educational background. Why work here?

180
00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:53,567
Oh, you came!

181
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,085
You can buy this for 90,000 won

182
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:59,463
I will give you a discount since you are a regular customer

183
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,908
Instead, don't you have a Chanel jacket this year?

184
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:03,868
Do you mean the plaid cloth? - Yes

185
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:07,176
This hasn't arrived yet. Come next week

186
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:07,927
OK

187
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:11,340
Our Dior skirt is beautiful

188
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:11,840
look

189
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:13,451
Is not she beautiful?

190
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,489
It will suit you well

191
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:18,712
give it to me

192
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:25,048
- Teacher - Hello, Na Ray

193
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:27,137
Master, I have been accepted

194
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:28,591
I'm going to Yale University!

195
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:30,498
I just received an email

196
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:32,538
truly?

197
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:35,067
I'm going to be your youngest classmate now!

198
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:36,995
OK

199
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,523
Congratulations to you Na Ray

200
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:42,635
What should I do?

201
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:44,648
I'm so happy I can't breathe

202
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:47,675
I'll visit the academy later with my mom

203
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:51,268
Good

204
00:13:58,028 --> 00:13:58,528
Yale?

205
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:01,928
As for writing articles

206
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:04,893
Instead of trying your best to just write

207
00:14:05,384 --> 00:14:08,935
It's even better when someone talented writes it and makes it look fun and unpretentious

208
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:12,917
But if you try to add a lot of fun to it

209
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:15,296
The article will start to lose its direction

210
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:20,000
If you overdo it to make it look too good it will distract the reader and become blurred

211
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,165
Miss Lee, this is so hard

212
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:24,362
You say it'll get boring if we try our best

213
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:26,282
He is right

214
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:27,646
Is this difficult?

215
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:31,202
Then it doesn't have to be too much fun

216
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:34,534
The most important thing is to know exactly what you want to talk about

217
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,799
As for your articles, I just changed the order

218
00:14:37,404 --> 00:14:39,522
What do you think of them after you changed the order? The goal is stronger than before

219
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:42,988
That's the parameter

220
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:45,253
Can't we go eat something after we're done?

221
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:46,425
That's the parameter

222
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:47,971
Buy us pizza

223
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,463
Pizza! Pizza!

224
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,282
I have plans today I can't

225
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,311
What kind of plans?

226
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:56,551
where are you going?

227
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,060
You have already arrived

228
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:05,210
I just arrived

229
00:15:07,134 --> 00:15:10,887
I have a drink I always order from them Do you want to order it too?

230
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,453
Yes

231
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:20,935
You must have been surprised that I suddenly called you

232
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:23,213
Yes a little

233
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:26,757
Where should I start?

234
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,627
Our university has something called a lifelong learning organization

235
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,245
It is an organization for the general public

236
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:37,334
Yes, I know her Lifelong Learning Organization

237
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,468
We have a place available for an elective class

238
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:42,519
It is not a difficult subject

239
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:44,291
And I thought of you

240
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:49,079
To be honest, I want more affiliates in college

241
00:15:55,026 --> 00:15:59,485
And I'm not actually looking for someone who is very talented

242
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:01,946
Your family's doing great, isn't it?

243
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:04,905
Sorry?

244
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,133
It seems you don't yet know how things work in this world

245
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,516
As you know, many are seeking to take this job

246
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:13,519
So it is not for free

247
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:15,550
I see

248
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:18,344
Aren't you working in an academy?

249
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:22,126
Because you don't have a side to belong to?

250
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:33,023
This apartment has the best view compared to other apartments in the unit

251
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:35,460
As it overlooks Gyeongbokgung Castle

252
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:40,000
The apartments above this building are spacious

253
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,955
They are not easily available for rent. You are in luck

254
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:46,212
Take your time looking around

255
00:16:49,393 --> 00:16:52,044
Why waste your diploma you got from America?

256
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:56,422
Being a part of us will give you a sense of belonging

257
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,007
Your protection under this group is very useful

258
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:04,077
After all, we are from the same university

259
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:11,148
Can I pay the rent monthly instead of annually?

260
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:48,519
that's cool

261
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,426
Anyway, your work at the academy was just a part-time job

262
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:55,935
It's hard to get a lecturer job even with the best degrees

263
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:57,381
I'm worried because it's my first time

264
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:00,250
You know you're going to do well, don't complain too much

265
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:06,790
I will be sent to work in China

266
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:08,107
to China?

267
00:18:09,162 --> 00:18:10,747
China these days is on fire with news

268
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:14,701
That's why they send employees like me who don't have a side to support them

269
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:22,141
But they said they will make me a permanent employee when I come back

270
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:25,621
For you

271
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:30,634
You've never been in a situation where you want something but you can't, right?

272
00:18:31,698 --> 00:18:32,422
I?

273
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:34,541
I say this because

274
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,923
The director of the academy asked me

275
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:42,164
On what?

276
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,963
About if your family was really that rich

277
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,043
Honestly, I've always been a bit jealous of you

278
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:54,758
I envy you so much that you left school

279
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,061
Without worrying about costs

280
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,846
hello my day

281
00:19:07,357 --> 00:19:08,241
This is my room

282
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:10,338
You have changed, right?

283
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,630
Ah, I'm so tired

284
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,793
I've lived my life really hard

285
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:26,183
but I

286
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:28,516
I'm still paying my father's debt

287
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:30,516
who was scammed 5 years ago

288
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,287
Even if you live hard

289
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,000
There is no guarantee that I will be rewarded as much as I work

290
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,345
But if you mess around a bit,

291
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:44,968
I will definitely pay for it

292
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,261
In our organization, we are always short of art students

293
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:00,960
That's why I brought a young and beautiful girl to join us

294
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,518
Have a sense of duty and do your job well

295
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:07,646
Otherwise, everyone in this room will be in trouble, next year

296
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:08,790
Good

297
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:13,791
These days, old lecturers are not very popular

298
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:17,735
That's why you should have a social standing when you get old

299
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,380
Professor, Doctor, or Lawyer You will finally understand the importance of these titles when you grow up

300
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:25,031
Commander

301
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,827
When you lecture in our organization, others will call you Professor

302
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:30,426
that's good

303
00:20:30,737 --> 00:20:31,237
Yes

304
00:20:32,637 --> 00:20:33,156
Help yourself

305
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:55,335
Welcome

306
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:58,832
I'm going to be teaching the classics reading and reading classes for this class

307
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:00,617
My name is Lee Anna

308
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:03,271
I look forward to teaching you

309
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:12,072
(Callographer Kim Jong-Hui)

310
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:13,434
It was the calligrapher Kim Jong Hui

311
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:17,490
He suffers when seeing works that do not meet his standards

312
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:20,608
His tongue was always saucy and he used to give barbs

313
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:24,361
He used to see that beautiful things are very important

314
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,735
When he sees a job he doesn't like

315
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:30,227
Doomed to fail

316
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:33,296
Or he says it smells bad

317
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:39,537
In fact, he was the first to coin the word "fiasco."

318
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:47,384
Maybe we can increase the number of students in the class next semester

319
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:50,000
You're so famous, rumors have spread about you

320
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,120
that's not true

321
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:56,365
I still miss a lot to reach the level of the rest of the teachers

322
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,265
Miss Lee, won't your family push you to marry?

323
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:05,334
indeed

324
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,164
I want to be your marriage broker

325
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,481
I'm not ready yet

326
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:17,457
The one I'm suggesting is a little big

327
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:19,210
But you won't regret it

328
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:22,270
You must have heard of IT Solid before

329
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,478
She appears a lot in the news IT Solid

330
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,534
Their stock price has gone up after receiving an investment

331
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:33,026
The president of the company is an acquaintance of mine from my hometown

332
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:35,818
He is looking for a girl to marry

333
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:54,878
Welcome

334
00:22:56,864 --> 00:22:58,131
nice to meet you

335
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:04,755
I've heard a lot about you from Professor Kim

336
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,573
I didn't know you were a famous person until the professor told me that

337
00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:13,865
not at all

338
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:19,547
I think the media has been curious about me lately

339
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:25,909
I heard you studied art in America

340
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:28,425
OK

341
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:32,083
When we built the company building

342
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,708
I have taken a lot of attention to decorating this hall where we are currently sitting

343
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:42,485
If you notice the pieces in place

344
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:49,534
You will see that each one is very carefully selected

345
00:23:50,034 --> 00:23:51,534
What do you think of the place?

346
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:53,835
Do you like my style?

347
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:00,000
Please rate the place from your artistic point of view

348
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:01,259
I feel shy

349
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:02,259
I'm not sure

350
00:24:03,914 --> 00:24:07,271
It's hard to get a special flair or sharp look quickly

351
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:11,493
But when your taste becomes fine, it's hard to lower your standards

352
00:24:13,836 --> 00:24:15,271
Why are all the seats here?

353
00:24:16,276 --> 00:24:18,340
counterfeit goods?

354
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:32,295
How did you know that?

355
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:34,845
I

356
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,901
I know a little about furniture

357
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:44,640
My God

358
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:49,428
I will be frank with you

359
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:53,268
I'm in no hurry to get married

360
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:02,423
Can we meet only three times?

361
00:25:04,964 --> 00:25:09,283
I will accept your decision then

362
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:12,925
I'm not sure

363
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,888
- Senpai - Yes

364
00:25:22,077 --> 00:25:26,935
Do you know Choi Ji Hoon from IT Solid

365
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:28,759
Of course I know him, he's famous

366
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:31,735
Self-made man with great leadership

367
00:25:32,235 --> 00:25:34,437
In the past year he has appeared in several interviews and their stock has gone up a lot

368
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:36,375
Why do you ask?

369
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,589
Will you enter the world of stocks?

370
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:46,867
He's a great person

371
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:51,717
But it is said that the rich in IT can be dangerous

372
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,623
I will postpone his sentence

373
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,531
He was poor before

374
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,411
And as I heard he has a complex about his educational background

375
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:03,476
What was it called? Is it a lifelong learning organization?

376
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:06,216
It is said that he takes lessons there at the highest level

377
00:26:08,157 --> 00:26:10,098
Let's take a break and drink this

378
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:20,000
it is delicious

379
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:30,000
It's late, why are you still awake?

380
00:26:30,227 --> 00:26:32,202
I woke up because of a dream

381
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:36,026
Drink this, then sleep

382
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,342
Are you leaving again?

383
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:44,401
what do you mean?

384
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:49,108
If you drink this, you will leave for America

385
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:52,462
that's not true

386
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:53,954
I will not leave

387
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:58,901
I saw you in my dream a while ago

388
00:26:59,754 --> 00:27:01,439
What kind of dream was it?

389
00:27:01,612 --> 00:27:07,461
I turned into a deer and I was looking at you from afar

390
00:27:07,688 --> 00:27:10,301
Yumi, why were you sad?

391
00:27:11,508 --> 00:27:14,228
Were you sad in the dream?

392
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:20,000
Yes, and I cried a lot

393
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:30,051
Help yourself

394
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:48,406
I will not leave anywhere

395
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:52,781
But mom

396
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,024
I will get married

397
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:07,201
I have no regrets, even if I die now

398
00:28:08,908 --> 00:28:10,804
Our daughter is very calm

399
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:13,201
So we didn't find out until much later

400
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:15,609
We didn't even know she had a boyfriend

401
00:28:17,387 --> 00:28:21,390
We are thinking of having a big wedding

402
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:27,201
I've learned a lot since I became a member of Tongyeong Council

403
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:30,785
Thinking of making it big to what extent?

404
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:32,801
do not worry

405
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:34,461
We will take care of all the equipment

406
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:37,268
I am grateful for your consideration

407
00:28:37,735 --> 00:28:40,227
But I can't do nothing

408
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:42,414
What are you saying?

409
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:44,642
Don't we all worry

410
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:48,885
About wasting money on the wedding?

411
00:28:49,243 --> 00:28:49,743
Yes that's right

412
00:28:49,743 --> 00:28:51,832
We can spend money and hire some people for that too

413
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:53,991
My God

414
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:57,404
How can we return this favor to you?

415
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:04,895
I only want one thing

416
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:07,735
I want a Mercedes-Benz as a gift from my daughter-in-law

417
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:09,332
And this will suffice me

418
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:12,866
Not because I want to ride it

419
00:29:13,244 --> 00:29:19,102
But the fact that it was my daughter-in-law who brought it to me, is what matters

420
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:20,000
naturally

421
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:22,631
my dear son

422
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:26,547
Since he was 20 he has only eaten ramen

423
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:29,644
And he worked in selling home subscription accounts to support me

424
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:32,611
He even saved our house that was about to be pawned

425
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:34,814
Isn't that

426
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:37,155
illegal?

427
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,748
You must not know much because you were outside

428
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:50,866
You can't make money if you follow all the laws

429
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:03,432
You must have waited so long

430
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:05,777
There is nothing wrong

431
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:09,823
When the wedding ends

432
00:30:10,863 --> 00:30:14,967
My husband and I will take you to the airport

433
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:17,085
If you want to pass through the crossing gate

434
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:20,465
You should at least travel to a nearby place like Japan

435
00:30:22,562 --> 00:30:24,961
What? Japan?

436
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,717
And also for the wedding

437
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:43,468
I wish you put more effort into your clothes and hair than today

438
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:45,351
Why?

439
00:30:46,357 --> 00:30:47,590
Don't like our look?

440
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:49,800
Yes

441
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:55,114
When I judge a person's physical condition

442
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:58,211
I focus on his shoes and his hair

443
00:31:02,145 --> 00:31:03,201
officially announced

444
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,428
That this marriage went smoothly

445
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:09,206
And I declare them before you husband and wife

446
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,068
The new couple's journey will now begin

447
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,299
Bride and groom, move!

448
00:31:44,342 --> 00:31:45,791
What an amazing wedding

449
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:49,234
It's true that they didn't even accept any gifts

450
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:50,604
Oh how beautiful they are

451
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:58,738
Let the parents come

452
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:05,202
Look at the camera

453
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:09,027
one two Three

454
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:12,379
one moment please

455
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:14,344
I am sorry

456
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:18,191
Min Jae, come here

457
00:32:20,763 --> 00:32:23,069
Min Jae, take a picture with us

458
00:32:25,034 --> 00:32:25,941
who is this?

459
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,278
He's my uncle's grandson named Choi Min Jae

460
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:31,615
Hello Maine Jay

461
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:32,858
It's a hyacinth flower

462
00:32:33,488 --> 00:32:36,201
It grows in the Balkans and Turkey

463
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:37,533
It grows in the fall

464
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:39,622
It has a bulbous rind

465
00:32:39,622 --> 00:32:40,398
what do you say?

466
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:41,074
Maine Jay, that's enough

467
00:32:41,074 --> 00:32:42,128
I'll take a picture

468
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,538
Look at the photographer

469
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:45,330
Please stand straight

470
00:32:45,835 --> 00:32:47,851
one two Three

471
00:32:54,017 --> 00:32:56,527
My God

472
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:05,891
Professor Lee, the picture is so beautiful

473
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:10,702
Roll it up again and put it in that room

474
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:12,157
Why?

475
00:33:13,094 --> 00:33:14,031
Won't you hang it up?

476
00:33:16,113 --> 00:33:19,708
Who puts up such cliched things these days?

477
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:21,465
I'm going out

478
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:22,591
Good

479
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:26,234
Goodbye

480
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:27,528
The door will open

481
00:33:31,024 --> 00:33:32,175
The door will be closed

482
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:12,852
You really...

483
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:16,248
Since you are in our university, why didn't you come to visit me earlier

484
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,953
Makes me feel apart

485
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,935
I didn't visit you because I knew you'd act like that

486
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,137
I stopped him from visiting you for fear of disturbing you

487
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,340
What do you mean by annoyance?

488
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,306
The Dean, your husband, and I are all like one family

489
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:34,663
Tongyeong family

490
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:35,353
This is correct

491
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,000
Tongyeong is part of Gyeongsang Province, right?

492
00:34:41,885 --> 00:34:45,245
I was born in Tongyeong

493
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:47,468
But I grew up in Ganseong, Jeolla Province

494
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,122
I see

495
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,236
Excuse me for a moment

496
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,703
It's an urgent call, I'll answer it and come quickly

497
00:35:10,293 --> 00:35:12,173
New Haven?

498
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,735
What was the name of that famous pizza shop?

499
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:20,334
Do you mean Frank Pepe?

500
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:22,574
Right, that's what I mean

501
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:25,414
There was also a garden next to it

502
00:35:25,634 --> 00:35:26,154
Yes

503
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:28,024
It's in front of Worcester Square

504
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,354
I went there 20 years ago

505
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:34,669
But I couldn't forget that shop's pizza

506
00:35:35,855 --> 00:35:38,743
Right, memories about food

507
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,139
can be fixed

508
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:48,582
I've heard a lot about you

509
00:35:49,682 --> 00:35:52,636
Looks like you're the only one keeping the organization going

510
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:56,895
what are you talking about? this is not true

511
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,135
Someone as capable as you shouldn't be in that place

512
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:02,087
Thank you hyungnim

513
00:36:02,957 --> 00:36:04,771
He has a sharp look at people

514
00:36:13,806 --> 00:36:15,275
Tell the dean to come here

515
00:36:15,786 --> 00:36:16,297
Good

516
00:36:17,933 --> 00:36:20,969
- Right, what about you? - yes

517
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:23,150
What news of your candidacy?

518
00:36:25,575 --> 00:36:26,714
It's hard

519
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:29,830
I am new in this field and I have no connections

520
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:31,901
Therefore, it is not easy

521
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,320
Right, this party is a bit difficult

522
00:36:36,074 --> 00:36:37,585
They don't want to accept anything new

523
00:36:38,193 --> 00:36:39,368
What a retarded old man

524
00:37:00,247 --> 00:37:01,012
Welcome

525
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:04,525
I am the professor of Asian Art History for this semester

526
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:05,995
My name is Lee Anna

527
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:09,593
It's my first time studying for university students

528
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,147
That's why I'm so nervous

529
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:13,935
I look forward to teaching you

530
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:25,861
She's a graduate of our university and it's her first time attending a meeting like this

531
00:37:26,488 --> 00:37:27,418
My colleague Anna

532
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:46,473
Wow, you are my legend Anna?

533
00:37:47,188 --> 00:37:48,508
Why did you attend the meeting all of a sudden?

534
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:51,153
People will only talk about it badly

535
00:37:52,151 --> 00:37:52,695
what is wrong with you?

536
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,043
She's your colleague, it's good to get to know each other

537
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:57,635
Are you close to her?

538
00:37:58,581 --> 00:38:01,433
Yes, I've known her for a while

539
00:38:02,274 --> 00:38:03,758
She's as beautiful as the rumors say

540
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:05,046
is not it?

541
00:38:05,991 --> 00:38:08,941
She should not study with such a face, she should have fun

542
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:13,924
I've heard a lot about you from Professor Yoon

543
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:16,580
- You should have come before. - Right

544
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:23,683
It's tuna stomach from Spain

545
00:38:25,038 --> 00:38:27,641
my husband? He's very busy and I don't see him often

546
00:38:29,222 --> 00:38:32,581
I don't know much but it looks like he's not going well

547
00:38:32,884 --> 00:38:33,384
naturally

548
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:37,519
There are a lot of variables when it comes to politics

549
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:38,937
It's very stressful work

550
00:38:39,437 --> 00:38:39,937
feel

551
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:43,000
He's a bit obsessed with working out

552
00:38:43,227 --> 00:38:45,127
I know what you mean

553
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:49,542
Your husband has a great desire to be recognized by others

554
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,067
But people are always like that

555
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:54,386
If they have a lot of money

556
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:56,122
They start greed for fame

557
00:38:57,254 --> 00:39:02,207
People around him are pushing him forward and cheering him on that's why he seems excited

558
00:39:04,023 --> 00:39:06,467
And once it really arrives, their reactions become lukewarm

559
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,899
It's always like that

560
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:10,423
This is not easy

561
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:12,213
to be frank

562
00:39:14,398 --> 00:39:16,243
I wish he didn't get into politics

563
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:23,007
I don't like to reveal my private life to the public, it makes me feel a burden

564
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:24,213
naturally

565
00:39:24,877 --> 00:39:25,901
This is annoying

566
00:39:30,155 --> 00:39:32,631
Maybe it will stop soon, right?

567
00:39:35,134 --> 00:39:37,638
A dessert dish consisting of matcha ice cream from Kyoto

568
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:43,904
(640 thousand won)

569
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:53,509
One meal costs 300,000 won

570
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:56,274
I'm sorry I ate something so expensive

571
00:39:57,592 --> 00:40:00,000
If you say something like that, I will be disappointed

572
00:40:02,135 --> 00:40:03,778
What's the best thing about being rich?

573
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:05,693
be honest

574
00:40:11,225 --> 00:40:14,752
Not hearing others bemoan the loss of money

575
00:40:16,221 --> 00:40:16,782
OK

576
00:40:17,468 --> 00:40:18,749
you are right

577
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:20,281
because I

578
00:40:21,746 --> 00:40:25,708
I feel like no one is worth wasting my money on

579
00:40:27,223 --> 00:40:28,133
Every day I regret

580
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:30,966
I regret wasting money for today too

581
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:34,237
It's delicious

582
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:36,708
We have expanded our fields

583
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:43,543
I am very happy to give this opportunity to students with special needs

584
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:46,534
I will always support your dreams and hopes

585
00:40:46,883 --> 00:40:50,636
I will continue to be by your side in the future

586
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,619
Hearty congratulations on your scholarship

587
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:01,919
This was a congratulatory message from our sponsor IT Solid

588
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,591
Chief

589
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,134
Sign language interpreter confused by time

590
00:41:07,285 --> 00:41:09,260
He's on his way now but apparently...

591
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,509
Why aren't things organized properly?

592
00:41:13,578 --> 00:41:14,382
Where is the mother of this child?

593
00:41:14,731 --> 00:41:17,387
She's been out for a while but she hasn't been answering her phone in a while

594
00:41:17,887 --> 00:41:19,219
Should we change the order?

595
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:22,035
Yes, we can postpone that to the end

596
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:24,521
Excuse me

597
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:29,282
Do you need a sign language interpreter?

598
00:41:29,782 --> 00:41:31,530
Yes, she is deaf and dumb, can you do it?

599
00:41:34,468 --> 00:41:35,067
from this way

600
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:50,000
You must be confused by the misunderstanding that happened

601
00:41:53,064 --> 00:41:54,537
She can go now

602
00:41:57,607 --> 00:42:01,710
The following paragraph is a farewell letter from scholarship student Lee Jin Young

603
00:42:17,986 --> 00:42:19,847
There is nothing wrong

604
00:42:19,847 --> 00:42:24,117
Even if you make a mistake, no one but me will know

605
00:42:28,738 --> 00:42:30,000
look at me

606
00:42:32,118 --> 00:42:36,579
You fools for not knowing sign language

607
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:38,063
idiots

608
00:43:02,238 --> 00:43:05,877
I'm Lee Jin Young and I've been chosen

609
00:43:05,877 --> 00:43:11,496
To get a scholarship as a talented art student

610
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:14,218
It is true that I can neither hear nor speak

611
00:43:14,854 --> 00:43:16,209
But when I draw

612
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:20,973
Become able to communicate with everything in the world

613
00:43:22,496 --> 00:43:27,272
Thank you for giving me such a precious opportunity to make my dreams come true

614
00:43:58,763 --> 00:44:02,750
Choi Ji Hoon of the Democratic Republican Party is getting a lot of attention

615
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,528
His domestic ratings were low

616
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:09,004
But the public loved him and he became very popular

617
00:44:09,307 --> 00:44:11,320
From now on we expect the competition to be fierce

618
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:44,071
The door will open

619
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:45,593
he arrived

620
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:53,053
The door will be closed

621
00:45:27,173 --> 00:45:28,758
This is you, right? daily
