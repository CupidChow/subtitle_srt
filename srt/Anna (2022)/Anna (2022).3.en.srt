2
00:00:07,376 --> 00:00:08,758
It has always been like that.

3
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:15,533
I always do everything I set my mind to.

6
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:49,776
The door's opening.

7
00:00:50,205 --> 00:00:51,592
It's here.

8
00:00:57,648 --> 00:00:59,410
The door's closing.

9
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:23,124
Wait.

10
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:27,476
Is that you, Yu-mi?

11
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:33,834
It is you.

12
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:36,619
Long time no see.

13
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:40,498
Do you work here?

14
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:55,925
The door's opening.

15
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,049
Aren't you getting off?

16
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:07,983
See you later.

17
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:14,349
The door's closing.

18
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,318
KANG JAE-HO

19
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,181
Hello, I'm reporter Han Ji-won
from Korea Daily.

20
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,748
Oh? Hey, Jae-ho.

21
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:56,683
It's me, Ji-won. Han Ji-won.

22
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,532
Oh, right.

23
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:04,371
-The editor of Ehyeon's magazine?
-Yes.

24
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:06,316
It's nice to see you. Sit down.

25
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,734
-Are you well?
-Yes.

26
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:09,654
I'm filling in for someone last minute

27
00:03:09,737 --> 00:03:11,589
so I didn't know I was meeting you.

28
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:13,419
-Really?
-I better give you my name card.

29
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,323
So you ended up
becoming a reporter after all.

30
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:22,414
You really made it.

31
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:24,836
I still have a long way to go.

32
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,523
It was better when I was a developer.
Managing a business is hard.

33
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:30,734
Did you stay in the States all this time?

34
00:03:30,817 --> 00:03:33,737
Yes.
Well, I had to since my business is there.

35
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:38,413
What a small world we live in.
We ended up meeting again.

36
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:39,900
You're right.

37
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:42,332
Do you still talk to everyone?

38
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:45,229
Yes, a few.

39
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:53,039
While bringing up my company,
I had to think a lot and make decisions.

40
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:56,464
Seoul is the world's
seventh largest megalopolis.

41
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:58,514
Dear people of Seoul

42
00:03:58,597 --> 00:04:01,183
and party members.

43
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:02,704
What we need...

44
00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:04,086
Is that you, Yu-mi?

45
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,013
It is you.

46
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:09,717
Long time no see.

47
00:04:12,397 --> 00:04:13,461
Do you work here?

48
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:19,175
I'm young,
and my leadership is innovative.

49
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,046
Please support Choi Ji-hoon.

50
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,604
Thank you!

51
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:26,026
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN PARTY'S
FIFTH PARTY CONVENTION

52
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,110
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

53
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:37,438
By the way,
when did you learn sign language?

54
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:39,666
I was so impressed
while watching the video online.

55
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:43,502
Countless people pressed like
on that video.

56
00:04:44,255 --> 00:04:49,288
You two are like Jacqueline
and President Kennedy.

57
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:51,112
You're just like them.

58
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,172
Please don't say something like that.

59
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:56,465
It might start weird news reports.

60
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:58,382
Shall we have a drink?

61
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,669
Anyway, just get elected
and it'll be smooth sailing.

62
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:02,911
Of course.

63
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:04,735
Let's remember

64
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:06,326
these members!

65
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,128
All right, all right.

66
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:25,943
Hey! Yu-mi!

67
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:33,071
Did you win the lottery or something?

68
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:03,680
SUN-WOO FROM MARAIS

69
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:12,040
Hey, Sun-woo.

70
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:14,281
It's me. Long time no talk.

71
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,713
Are you well?

72
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:24,453
No, I'm not doing well.

73
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:26,268
I think Marais
will go out of business soon.

74
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,597
You don't know yet, do you?

75
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,261
Mr. Lee passed away last year
due to a stroke.

76
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:35,588
Little Director came back to Korea
last month to get a divorce.

77
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:38,206
Is she planning to stay here?

78
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:41,073
She said she'll go back, but I'm not sure.

79
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:44,586
I heard she started
a fashion business there with a celebrity.

80
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:49,825
Professor Lee.

81
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,890
It's almost 7:00 p.m.
Aren't you going home?

82
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,811
You must have a lot on your mind.

83
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:57,011
I'll head out first.

84
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,259
Okay.

85
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:09,761
Wow, it smells good.

86
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,396
Why did you come unannounced?

87
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,129
I could've ordered some in advance
if you did.

88
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:21,081
I suddenly remembered
that you have Wednesdays off.

89
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,281
This is delicious.

90
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:25,577
It's even better
since I didn't expect to eat this.

91
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:29,837
Ji-won.

92
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,867
Yes?

93
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:36,669
Why do you want to become
a political journalist?

94
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,791
I'm not sure. Well...

95
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:44,067
I kind of feel a sense of duty.

96
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:48,926
These people always talk about
beliefs and justice,

97
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,134
but in actuality, they get together

98
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:53,981
to rig everything and lie.

99
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:57,077
And when these people get caught,

100
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,208
they're never sorry.

101
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:03,823
Someone needs to teach them a lesson.
Don't you agree?

102
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,694
Don't pick up.

103
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,175
Why not?

104
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:26,205
It's probably someone
complaining about the noise.

105
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,445
It's late. Do it later.

106
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,083
Can we move?

107
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:54,581
Why all of a sudden?

108
00:08:56,348 --> 00:09:01,086
I want to live where I can
open the windows all the way.

109
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,365
It's suffocating.

110
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:11,339
But everyone's jealous of our place
even when the windows don't open.

111
00:09:11,422 --> 00:09:13,317
We're like a symbol that tells them,

112
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:16,277
they can become like us if they work hard.

113
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:23,407
People will say it's too extravagant
during the election campaign.

114
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,473
I met with Ji-won.

115
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:39,534
Okay.

116
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,319
Korea Daily?
That company doesn't seem so good.

117
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:46,974
I see.

118
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:49,694
Is there a position you can make for her?

119
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,182
At a political desk.

120
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,072
That would be no problem at all.

121
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:03,860
People won't talk bad about you
even if you get her a position.

122
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:07,408
She's smart and is a person of principles.

123
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:12,212
Okay.

124
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:16,707
But I have a condition.

125
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:21,603
You should try to get along
with the assemblymen's wives.

126
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:28,548
I can't get along with them.

127
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:29,920
Just humor them.

128
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:33,784
Fine. But please smoke outside.

129
00:10:54,998 --> 00:10:56,052
Hello?

130
00:10:56,473 --> 00:10:58,328
Are you Korea Daily's Han Ji-won?

131
00:10:59,214 --> 00:11:00,586
Yes, this is she.

132
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,682
I'm calling from Bokuk Daily's HR team.

133
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:06,062
I can go near Korea Daily's office
in about two hours.

134
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:07,425
Shall we meet for a moment?

135
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:10,088
I can, but what is this about?

136
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:12,274
To offer you a position.

137
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:14,546
Pardon?

138
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,832
She was trying to fix it by herself...

139
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:27,197
Hyun-joo might seem old enough...

140
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,417
Yes.

141
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,357
But she knows nothing about the world.

142
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:34,366
Do you know how much debt
that hospital has?

143
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:36,925
It's crazy.

144
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:37,956
Yes.

145
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:46,942
We'll just give them the money as soon as
the building sells to finish it off.

146
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:51,630
It'll really ruin her at this rate.

147
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:53,386
Yes. Right now?

148
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:56,397
I came to feed Hyun-joo's dog,
and now I'm on my way to the lawyer.

149
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:18,944
What's your job?

150
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:20,838
I'm sorry, Sir.

151
00:12:22,196 --> 00:12:25,034
I messaged you to ask you
to come down after ten minutes.

152
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:26,052
You messaged me?

153
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:30,856
Did you say you messaged me?

154
00:12:32,363 --> 00:12:34,050
I left home early,

155
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,860
but there was an accident
on Inner Ring Expressway.

156
00:12:36,943 --> 00:12:40,389
The exits are few and far between there.
I'm so sorry.

157
00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:42,007
It's basic to be on time.

158
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,570
Also, look at the car.

159
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:47,015
I got a car wash yesterday,

160
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:50,014
but it rained overnight.

161
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:53,023
I couldn't look after it today.

162
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,212
I'm so sorry.

163
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:57,840
You never tried preparing in advance,
have you?

164
00:12:57,923 --> 00:12:59,326
Today was an exception.

165
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:00,455
I'll get things right next time, sir.

166
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:02,179
Why always next time?

167
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:12,383
Do you know what's common
among people like you?

168
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,274
You're lazy,

169
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,953
impatient,

170
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:20,257
and full of excuses.

171
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:27,363
Honey!

172
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:30,594
Mr. Kim, wake up.

173
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:34,091
How will you make a living like this?

174
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:35,609
Please stop.

175
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:36,739
Stop!

176
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:41,340
Step aside.

177
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:45,725
Keep your mouth shut.

178
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,841
Gosh, it's hot.

179
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:02,333
Do you feel wronged?

180
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:07,096
After all, you did send a text.

181
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,577
What could be the problem?

182
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:17,330
Hey.

183
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:22,473
I'm sorry, Sir.

184
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:24,816
This won't ever happen again.

185
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,367
It was nice having you.

186
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,965
Sir.

187
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:36,218
Sir, I'll fix my mistake.

188
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:37,691
Sir.

189
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:39,910
Sir.

190
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,093
Ta-da.

191
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,189
What is this?

192
00:14:58,992 --> 00:15:02,501
You mentioned you used to like
the Crazy Donut in front of our school.

193
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:06,070
Oh.

194
00:15:07,268 --> 00:15:08,607
I was reminded of you,

195
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,038
so I went there in a hurry
just before going to the airport.

196
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:12,372
Are you proud of me?

197
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,896
Yes. Thank you.

198
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,613
It didn't even cross my mind.

199
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:21,909
Ms. Lee, I heard you're a professor now.

200
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:23,417
Congratulations.

201
00:17:26,152 --> 00:17:27,176
Lee Yu-mi.

202
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:32,193
I think you owe me an explanation.

203
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:38,281
TO LEE ANNA

204
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:04,150
The name Lee Anna is suspicious.

205
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,211
Also, the Alumni Association?

206
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,649
Hey.

207
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:11,319
I called the number here
because I was curious about Lee Anna,

208
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:14,233
and they told me right away.

209
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:29,552
I had my reasons.

210
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,640
I don't want to know.

211
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:37,936
There's no reason that can make it okay

212
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:39,738
for someone like you
to teach at a university.

213
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:42,517
I mean, do people buy this?

214
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,662
Seriously?

215
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:51,736
I didn't do it intentionally.

216
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:08,064
Professor Lee.

217
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:12,504
If doing things unintentionally
makes it okay,

218
00:19:12,587 --> 00:19:14,333
why do you think we have laws?

219
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,566
This is fraud.

220
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:22,614
What should we do?

221
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:25,981
Well?

222
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,689
Lee Anna.

223
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,655
What should we do now?

224
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:00,523
I'll stop.

225
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,330
Please give me some time.

226
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,651
How is it so easy for you?

227
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:14,057
How can it become like it never happened?

228
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:17,998
You stole someone else's life,

229
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:21,836
so you must pay for it.

230
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:24,400
Don't you think so?

231
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:28,848
Nice.

232
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:36,152
You have overwhelming support
from the young and the established,

233
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,376
while your wife is especially popular

234
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:42,123
among the marginalized groups.

235
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:45,455
I'm lucky.

236
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:49,519
It's true she's playing an important role.

237
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:50,929
So what you do want to do?

238
00:20:52,257 --> 00:20:56,565
What do you think about having her
run a school?

239
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:01,463
The chairman of Dongsung University
is regretting

240
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:03,063
after buying the school.

241
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:05,487
The professors don't listen

242
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:10,941
and the students are always complaining
and stirring up noise.

243
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:12,402
He says it's a headache.

244
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:14,308
Or perhaps

245
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:18,110
a scholarship foundation geared towards
public interest might be good.

246
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,247
It doesn't cost much,

247
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,580
and it's quite effective.

248
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:26,286
A scholarship foundation?

249
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:29,510
It would be much better than

250
00:21:29,593 --> 00:21:32,725
having her stand at a subway station
with your campaign jacket on.

251
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:36,760
-It's different.
-Yes, it's different.

252
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,102
By next month,

253
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,193
bring me three billion won.

254
00:21:56,006 --> 00:22:00,121
What is it?
Do you prefer criminal punishment?

255
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,806
You didn't think
it would be so expensive, right?

256
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:10,511
That's how it is with degrees.
They're expensive.

257
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:21,745
You should demand what's possible.

258
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:26,172
I don't have anything.

259
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:29,989
That's not my problem.

260
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:33,187
That's your problem.

261
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,802
It's your problem for stealing my life.

262
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:40,572
Don't reflect on yourself in front of
a judge who has nothing to do with me.

263
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:42,130
Pay me back with money instead.

264
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:49,041
Does your husband know this about you?

265
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:04,413
You're really something.

266
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:09,215
Hey. You should keep on using the stairs.

267
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,592
Hey, newbie.

268
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:21,014
I'll show you
what a real welcome looks like.

269
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:24,762
Get up.

270
00:23:29,464 --> 00:23:30,489
Did you just laugh?

271
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:34,296
Aren't you going to get up?

272
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,799
That's enough.

273
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,155
No, no.

274
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:41,320
Call me "honey" just once.

275
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:44,152
Then I'll let things pass.

276
00:23:45,953 --> 00:23:49,049
"Honey".

277
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,323
She got up. She got up.

278
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:57,267
What is this?

279
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,361
What's with the face?

280
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:04,183
Don't reflect on yourself in front of
a judge who has nothing to do with me.

281
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:05,939
Pay me back with money instead.

282
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:08,858
Understand?

283
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:16,682
What is it at this hour?

284
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:19,058
I think Mr. Choi...

285
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:20,513
Yes?

286
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:22,500
...fell asleep in the parking lot.

287
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,178
This is the police.

288
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:10,787
Good evening. I want to report someone
for drinking and driving.

289
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:14,854
-What?
-I forgot my bag inside.

290
00:25:15,787 --> 00:25:19,306
-Your bag?
-It's right here.

291
00:25:19,892 --> 00:25:21,463
Darn it, where did that come from?

292
00:25:22,526 --> 00:25:23,619
Hey, wait for me.

293
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:26,008
Let them be.

294
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,829
If you stop them,
you'll have to see them home.

295
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:32,693
Goodnight!

296
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
<font color="#f5e100">❤️Join @ADrama_Lovers telegram channel for asian dramas❤️</font>

297
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,872
I didn't get hired through
open recruitment either.

298
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,160
So I can't promise to help you.

299
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:46,392
Just hang in there.

300
00:25:47,163 --> 00:25:48,295
I'm off.

301
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:50,056
Okay. Bye.

302
00:25:56,916 --> 00:26:00,219
Nag all you want, I won't budge.

303
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,670
Why did the police come
in the middle of the night?

304
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,839
It was nothing much.

305
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,144
Why would they come here
if it's nothing much?

306
00:26:22,118 --> 00:26:23,802
I'm going to establish

307
00:26:23,885 --> 00:26:26,222
a scholarship foundation
under your name soon.

308
00:26:27,164 --> 00:26:28,097
What?

309
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,028
You'll be the chairperson.

310
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:37,292
Do I have to do it?

311
00:26:40,738 --> 00:26:42,216
What's with the reaction?

312
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,356
It's uncomfortable to be someone

313
00:26:46,777 --> 00:26:47,917
the media talks about.

314
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,653
We wear nice clothes and drive a nice car
for other people to see.

315
00:26:55,058 --> 00:26:57,575
This country is harsh
to those who are weak

316
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,998
and generous to those who are established.

317
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:04,582
The election isn't something simple.

318
00:27:05,153 --> 00:27:09,830
Even the way we breathe has meaning
and we can get evaluated on it.

319
00:27:09,913 --> 00:27:10,876
Okay?

320
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:18,606
Didn't I tell you?

321
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:22,339
My assistant will join me
to and from work starting today.

322
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,445
-Mr. Jung?
-No, my secretary.

323
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,517
You're here.

324
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:34,215
Wait a minute.

325
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:41,240
Hello, Professor Lee.

326
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:43,305
My name is Cho Yu-mi.

327
00:27:43,388 --> 00:27:44,808
I look forward to working for you.

328
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,281
Hello.

329
00:27:52,508 --> 00:27:57,193
Ms. Cho Yu-mi...

330
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:01,175
Get up.

331
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:08,018
Hey. What are you going to do?

332
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:12,483
What is this? Explain it to me.

333
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,140
Who told you to use this building
as collateral?

334
00:28:15,223 --> 00:28:18,985
What is it? It's too early for this.

335
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:21,865
Hyun-joo, get up. Get up.

336
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:24,354
Hyun-joo,

337
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:26,264
what did you do?

338
00:28:26,676 --> 00:28:27,689
Yes.

339
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:30,856
"Yes"?

340
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:37,216
I'll die before my time because of you.

341
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,030
You...

342
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,955
You're out of your mind!

343
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:48,987
How could you blow off this building?

344
00:28:49,648 --> 00:28:51,910
What's wrong with you?

345
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:53,908
I'll take care of it.

346
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,723
Take care of what?

347
00:28:59,746 --> 00:29:02,113
I'll just pay back the three billion won.

348
00:29:02,196 --> 00:29:03,804
It's nothing.

349
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:04,857
What?

350
00:29:08,364 --> 00:29:10,204
I said I'll take care of it.

351
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:12,951
Please stop it!

352
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,503
You only know how to spend money.
You've never earned a cent in your life.

353
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:22,963
How can you take care of anything?

354
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:26,786
Tell me!

355
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:33,685
I'm sorry,
it's because it's my first time.

356
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:35,872
Yes, it's your first time.
Just press this.

357
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:39,467
Okay?

358
00:29:40,168 --> 00:29:43,539
I'm leaving.
Don't forget the gathering this evening.

359
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:46,239
From now on, Yu-mi will remind you.

360
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,887
Hello, Professor Lee.
My name is Cho Yu-mi.

361
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:03,621
Even the way we breathe has meaning
and we can get evaluated on it.

362
00:30:03,704 --> 00:30:05,164
You didn't think
it would be so expensive, right?

363
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:08,876
That's how it is with degrees.
They're expensive.

364
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:21,042
Hey.

365
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,676
What brought you here?

366
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:34,582
Our company is planning a small exhibition
and the person who was on the project

367
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:37,574
ended up giving birth
earlier than she thought.

368
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:39,165
We need some help.

369
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,043
I see.

370
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:45,712
Joseon literati paintings.
It's your specialty.

371
00:30:45,795 --> 00:30:47,017
Do you want to take over?

372
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,135
Why don't you do it yourself?

373
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:54,544
It's too small for me to do.

374
00:30:55,545 --> 00:30:58,246
The people who own these works
want to sell the paintings,

375
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:00,254
but you know these kinds of works
don't increase in prices.

376
00:31:00,337 --> 00:31:02,667
The exhibition will be held
so we can promote the pieces.

377
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:05,749
I don't know.

378
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:14,754
There's no pressure
since it's not about making money.

379
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,739
There's enough time to prepare it too.

380
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:26,522
What is it? Is it too lame?

381
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:31,685
I used to take jobs
like this at first too.

382
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,038
No, it's not that...

383
00:31:38,027 --> 00:31:40,490
Can't you help me out this once?

384
00:31:43,397 --> 00:31:44,861
How much

385
00:31:46,836 --> 00:31:48,120
will they pay me?

386
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:52,819
Come on, you know this won't pay much.

387
00:31:52,902 --> 00:31:55,410
It's not like you're looking for money.

388
00:31:57,368 --> 00:31:59,473
Please do it for me.

389
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:03,027
Democratic Republican Party's Choi Ji-hoon

390
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,124
is making prominent progress,

391
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:07,837
but as factions of
the 51 newly-elected members

392
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,300
out of the 117
in the National Assembly are unclear,

393
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:14,133
it's hard to predict the result.

394
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:16,389
Currently,
the Democratic Republican Party...

395
00:32:16,472 --> 00:32:17,558
Mr. Jung.

396
00:32:19,347 --> 00:32:21,374
What should we do with Min Jun-won?

397
00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:25,371
Don't mind him.

398
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,361
Should I dig about his son?

399
00:32:34,925 --> 00:32:37,225
Is that necessary?

400
00:32:38,996 --> 00:32:42,328
We need something on him
since he's bothering us.

401
00:32:44,238 --> 00:32:45,222
Okay.

402
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:54,878
Professor Lee.

403
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:00,061
Professor Lee.

404
00:33:04,697 --> 00:33:07,219
I have something to ask you.

405
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:13,654
My kid is getting a surgery tomorrow.

406
00:33:13,737 --> 00:33:18,805
I wonder if I could have tomorrow
and the day after off.

407
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:21,550
It's nothing serious,

408
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:24,621
but my kid is still in middle school,
so...

409
00:33:26,025 --> 00:33:27,443
Why is...

410
00:33:29,794 --> 00:33:31,482
everyone doing this to me?

411
00:33:43,593 --> 00:33:45,652
You can't do this all of a sudden.

412
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:52,517
Don't you know that the campaign team
is having a meal here tomorrow?

413
00:33:57,283 --> 00:33:59,076
Why are you so selfish?

414
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:02,383
Please don't worry about that.

415
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:04,463
I already prepared everything,

416
00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:06,333
and someone else will come instead.

417
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:11,767
Someone I don't know is coming?

418
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,151
No, no. It's not a stranger.

419
00:34:14,234 --> 00:34:16,566
It's Yang Soo-jin.

420
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:20,742
She came several times before
whenever we had big events.

421
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:24,944
You know, the tall girl with short hair.

422
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,130
You'll recognize her when you see her.

423
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:40,328
I see.

424
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:45,180
Now that I think about it,
it might inconvenience you.

425
00:34:47,278 --> 00:34:48,931
I'm sorry,

426
00:34:49,014 --> 00:34:51,836
please don't mind me. It's okay.

427
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,561
How can I act like nothing happened?

428
00:34:57,821 --> 00:35:00,444
Why are you making me
look like a bad person?

429
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:03,611
Are you going to cancel the surgery?

430
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,039
No, it's not like that...

431
00:35:08,122 --> 00:35:10,017
Why do I have to

432
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,145
humor you too?

433
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:15,497
Why do I have to pay attention
to such things?

434
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:41,382
It's fine.

435
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:44,134
Just take two days off.

436
00:35:47,165 --> 00:35:49,269
I'm sorry, Professor Lee.

437
00:35:49,352 --> 00:35:52,237
I asked you too last minute.

438
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:58,697
It can't be helped in your situation.

439
00:36:00,173 --> 00:36:03,859
Sorry I'm a little sensitive today.

440
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:07,404
We'll eat out tomorrow.

441
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:13,585
What is it?

442
00:36:16,118 --> 00:36:18,081
I came to get you for the dinner.

443
00:36:22,494 --> 00:36:26,706
From now on, call me from downstairs.

444
00:36:27,823 --> 00:36:28,787
Yes, Ma'am.

445
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:34,637
She usually never yells.

446
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:39,073
It's because I made a mistake today.

447
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:58,017
Ms. Cho. You must be someone honest.

448
00:36:58,734 --> 00:37:02,279
No, I'm just someone ordinary.

449
00:37:02,362 --> 00:37:06,530
Isn't it hard working for Ji-hoon?

450
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,137
Not at all.

451
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:12,801
I know this job
doesn't allow any time off.

452
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:17,139
But it's a precious opportunity for me,

453
00:37:17,222 --> 00:37:19,608
so I want to do my best
and get recognized.

454
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:27,808
Also, he's very nice to me.

455
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,022
See?

456
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,320
Everyone lies.

457
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:40,332
No, I'm telling you the truth.

458
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:53,737
Ma'am, he's asking you to wait 20 minutes.

459
00:37:55,103 --> 00:37:56,037
Why?

460
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,657
He says you should come in
after everyone arrives.

461
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,467
I'll go in and check first.

462
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:27,677
I don't think he's here yet.

463
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,661
What?

464
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:31,251
I checked
with the restaurant manager twice.

465
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:33,816
What a joke.

466
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:38,089
It'd be ridiculous to wait here.

467
00:38:38,172 --> 00:38:39,431
Let's circle around.

468
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,063
Yes, Ma'am.

469
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,956
Hey, Mom.

470
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:52,081
Can I skip this meeting?

471
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:58,064
I think he's crazy.
That stupid doctor isn't here yet.

472
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,144
Let's go in. Everyone's here.

473
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:22,532
It's not like everything always goes
the way you want.

474
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:24,689
No, of course not.

475
00:39:24,772 --> 00:39:28,064
It's the will of the people
and the will of the party.

476
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:32,123
But if the will

477
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:35,924
keeps on changing,

478
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:39,027
the people will get confused.

479
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:42,627
Things change by the day.

480
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,843
I don't know what to tell you.

481
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:46,269
It's okay.

482
00:39:46,352 --> 00:39:49,574
You were elected four times
and you'll act as my pacemaker,

483
00:39:49,657 --> 00:39:50,984
so I'm happy.

484
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,866
You say it's urgent,
so could you tell me what it's about?

485
00:39:57,714 --> 00:39:58,704
Here.

486
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:03,838
-Please have a drink.
-Okay.

487
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:04,935
Sir.

488
00:40:06,747 --> 00:40:07,837
Thank you.

489
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,663
It's been so long since we drank.

490
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:06,388
LEE ANNA

491
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:14,710
LEE ANNA, PROFESSOR

492
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:16,393
YALE UNIVERSITY,
MASTER OF EAST ASIAN STUDIES

493
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,587
Jae-ho.

494
00:41:26,688 --> 00:41:29,455
Why didn't you call me in advance?
Do you want some coffee?

495
00:41:29,538 --> 00:41:32,015
No, it's okay.
I stopped by on my way to the airport.

496
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:33,661
-Are you going to the US?
-Yes.

497
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,856
By the way, you changed companies.

498
00:41:39,446 --> 00:41:40,354
Right.

499
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:46,867
"Bokuk"?

500
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,467
Isn't it the biggest one in Korea?

501
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,816
Yes.

502
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:54,680
I didn't make the cut
when I took the entrance exam before,

503
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,349
but I'll work hard from now.

504
00:41:57,027 --> 00:41:59,127
The elections are soon, so it's hectic.

505
00:41:59,843 --> 00:42:02,504
Good for you. I think you'll do well.

506
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:03,660
Thank you.

507
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:06,886
By the way,

508
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:10,659
I don't think you would have came here
just to see me.

509
00:42:18,183 --> 00:42:19,312
Is this

510
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,495
Lee Yu-mi?

511
00:42:24,443 --> 00:42:25,400
Yes.

512
00:42:26,285 --> 00:42:28,950
I didn't want things to be awkward,
so I never brought her up.

513
00:42:32,204 --> 00:42:35,232
I'm not going to live in Korea anyway,

514
00:42:35,315 --> 00:42:37,279
so it doesn't matter what she does.

515
00:42:39,044 --> 00:42:42,594
But I thought I should tell you
why I broke up with her.

516
00:42:42,677 --> 00:42:45,465
Jae-ho, let bygones be bygones.

517
00:42:45,548 --> 00:42:46,957
It's not that, Ji-won.

518
00:42:50,915 --> 00:42:52,399
Lee Yu-mi

519
00:42:54,643 --> 00:42:55,905
didn't go to your school.

520
00:42:59,116 --> 00:43:00,087
What?

521
00:43:00,941 --> 00:43:03,338
I have no idea how she graduated
from NYU and Yale

522
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:05,471
to become a professor,

523
00:43:07,691 --> 00:43:09,486
but she was a fake university student
when we were dating.

524
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:12,230
She was preparing for her SATs
a third time.
