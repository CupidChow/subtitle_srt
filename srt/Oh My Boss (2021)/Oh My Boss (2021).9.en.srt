1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,340
<i>You seem a bit tense whenever you're with me, Nim-san.</i>

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,050
<i>Fine. Then I will ask you directly.</i>

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,620
<i>You and Koji are dating now, aren't you?</i>

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,690
<i>Do you know him well enough?</i>

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,890
<i>There are so many things you don't know about him.</i>

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,283
<i>Koji is more dangerous than you think.</i>

7
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,613
<i>You're more serious about her than I thought.</i>

8
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:23,421
<i>Did you forget about us?</i>

9
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:25,300
<i>That means you've been living in Thailand for a while, right?</i>

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,420
<i>I go back sometimes.</i>

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,860
<i>- Who do you go back to?
- Your wife and children?</i>

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,690
<i>Tonight was so much fun, but I must go.</i>

13
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,520
<i>He has to go take care of his work. It's urgent.</i>

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,840
<i>What work is that?</i>

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,723
<i>You're his secretary. Do you know what it is?</i>

16
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:39,823
<i>Yes, tell us.</i>

17
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:42,400
<i>I met Akitsuki's woman already.</i>

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,680
<i>Relax. She's just an ordinary girl.</i>

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,240
<i>You can't even handle a simple girl.</i>

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,431
<i>I just wanted to warn you about Rena.</i>

21
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:53,155
<i>She went back to Japan.</i>

22
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:55,740
<i>It looks like she's planning something.</i>

23
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,840
<i>Boss, it will be good to be careful.</i>

24
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,580
<i>[Oh My Boss]</i>

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,700
‎‎♫ <i>Do you think you're the only one who feels this way</i> ♫

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,650
‎‎♫ <i>What you feel in your heart</i> ♫

27
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:33,250
‎‎♫ <i>Do you think that I don't feel the same</i> ♫

28
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,610
‎‎♫ <i>Is it okay to only think like that</i> ♫

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,600
‎‎♫ <i>Why are you keeping it to yourself</i> ♫

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,940
‎‎♫ <i>Tell me what you're thinking, no need to wait</i> ♫

31
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:57,850
‎‎♫ <i>I can't see clearly if you love me or if you're just lonely</i> ♫

32
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,253
<i>[Koji: I've arrived in Korea.]</i>

33
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,262
<i>[Nim: When you arrive at the hotel, let me know.]</i>

34
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:13,240
<i>[Nim: Did you have a good sleep last night?]</i>

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,810
Nong Nim, when is Boss returning from Korea?

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,320
He should be back in the office again on Monday.

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,500
Do you need anything, P'Joy?

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,883
I want the travel schedule and the captions for the influencers to post.

39
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:34,763
I'm going to compile everything and give it to them.

40
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:39,385
All right. I've already finished translating that for you. I'll send it to you now.

41
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:43,286
Really? Thank you.

42
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:48,230
It's so nice that Boss has a secretary. That way I don't have to ask him directly.

43
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,180
I've sent you the file, P'Joy.

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,169
- Thank you.
- Sure.

45
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:55,951
Bye bye.

46
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,000
<i>How are you doing?</i>

47
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,550
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

48
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,930
<i>You don't miss me at all, do you?</i>

49
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,110
Who are you chatting with, Nong Nim?

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,825
I'm not.

51
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,720
P'Ja Oh, did you need something?

52
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,410
A client is here to see you, Nong Nim.

53
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,211
A client?

54
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:05,410
But I don't have an appointment with anyone today.

55
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,566
What's the client's name?

56
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:09,760
- Khun Mark.
- Khun Mark?

57
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,234
He said he had to talk to you about something. I'm not quite sure, either.

58
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:17,346
I'm sorry I'm a bit late.

59
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:21,177
He's already here.

60
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,240
Khun Mark is here?

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,800
Akitsuki-san phoned me at 3 a.m.

62
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,363
He said there would be a client coming to see you. He asked me to take care of you closely.

63
00:04:34,363 --> 00:04:36,120
Let's go now.

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,820
Okay.

65
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,410
Hello.

66
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,204
Please take your seat.

67
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,710
Let me get straight to the point.

68
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:14,259
Your boss was quite harsh on me.

69
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,010
What is it about?

70
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:22,768
It's about what happened at the restaurant that day.

71
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:31,686
Your boss reported it to my company,

72
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:35,906
which led me to being heavily interrogated.

73
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:40,246
But anyway, just let it go.

74
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:45,316
In the end, it's undeniably my own fault.

75
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,486
Khun Noom Nim, I apologize for making you feel bad about what happened.

76
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:01,016
Yes.

77
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:06,916
It's all right, but from now on, please only focus on work.

78
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,996
That's how it will be.

79
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:16,546
And I would like you to also apologize to P'In.

80
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:20,856
Actually, I've planned to see her after finishing it here.

81
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:24,396
All right.

82
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:28,812
Do you have anything to say, Khun Noom Nim?

83
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:32,936
If you want to curse at me, please do so.

84
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:35,836
Because I'm here to let you curse at me anyway.

85
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:43,936
In fact, I want to do more than just curse.

86
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,966
I want to report it to the police so that you will go to jail.

87
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:50,046
Is that so?

88
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:54,706
But that's just a want.

89
00:06:55,746 --> 00:07:00,376
You got interrogated by the company already, so I'll just let it go.

90
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:08,967
So did you come here today just for this?

91
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:11,560
Yes.

92
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,290
I honestly just wanted to find someone to talk to.

93
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,456
I don't have any serious business to discuss.

94
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,600
Khun Noom Nim, you don't have to pay attention to me.

95
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,076
You better worry more about yourself.

96
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,076
About your boss...

97
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:40,986
Why?

98
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:46,811
It seems like you trust Akitsuki-san a lot.

99
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:54,196
Are you sure you really know him well enough?

100
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:02,266
Don't let him toy with you so easily.

101
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:12,416
But if he ever gets bored with you, I'm always here.

102
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:16,926
Do you have something stuck in your throat?

103
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:23,043
Noom Nim-san. You may get back to work.

104
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:26,206
I think it's no use staying here.

105
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,556
Please excuse me. Goodbye.

106
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:50,014
He hasn't replied for two days already.

107
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:52,669
I should send him a complaining message.

108
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:56,774
<i>Don't forget to have your meal.</i>

109
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:04,686
That's probably too sweet.

110
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,776
<i>What time is it in Korea now?</i>

111
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,056
<i>It's 10 a.m. Why? What's wrong?</i>

112
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:20,126
<i>Khun Koji is now in Korea working. I just want to remind him to have his meal. Should I do so?</i>

113
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:24,197
<i>Gosh. After you two made up, you guys are so sweet.</i>

114
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:28,737
<i>Not at all! He has been away for two days already, but he didn't even phone or text me at all!</i>

115
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:31,106
<i>What? Why is he like that?</i>

116
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:33,289
<i>I don't know. I called, but he didn't pick up.</i>

117
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:36,165
<i>He must be busy with work.</i>

118
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:40,466
<i>Is he busy with work or busy hooking up with pretty Korean girls?</i>

119
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:41,869
<i>Or maybe Korean guys?</i>

120
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:44,469
<i>You guys, stop it. Don't instigate!</i>

121
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,056
<i>What about this? Try sending him a sweet message.</i>

122
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:53,586
<i>"Boss, I really miss you. It's getting unbearable."</i>

123
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:57,416
<i>"I want to hug you. I want to kiss you so bad."</i>

124
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,906
<i>Crazy! That's appalling. Who would send something like that?!</i>

125
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:04,486
<i>Meow, something demure doesn't work. Send something more provocative.</i>

126
00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:06,057
<i>Nim, believe me.</i>

127
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:09,825
You must post a selfie of yourself pulling your shirt down with a caption,

128
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:12,046
<i>"Are you hungry? Would you like to eat me?"</i>

129
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,276
<i>That's hot! Go with that one.</i>

130
00:11:13,276 --> 00:11:16,046
<i>That's disgusting! I won't talk to you guys anymore!</i>

131
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:01,486
Noom Nim-san?

132
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,486
What are you doing?

133
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:17,096
- A bug! A bug got inside my shirt.
- Oh...

134
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:18,586
It hurts and itches.

135
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:20,742
I see. Please be careful.

136
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,384
It's gone now. It has finally gone away.

137
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,026
Oh! Nong Nim, haven't you left yet?

138
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:51,296
Not yet. After I finish these, I'll leave.

139
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:55,230
Okay. Don't overwork yourself or you'll get sick.

140
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,100
Thank you.

141
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,520


142
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,968
Oh, you dressed up so prettily. You must have an appointment, don't you?

143
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:09,526
I'm having dinner with my boyfriend's mother, so I dressed up a little.

144
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:13,516
That's nice. You're having dinner with your boyfriend.

145
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:18,116
Well, you should find yourself a lover, Nong Nim, so they can take you out for dinner.

146
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:21,476
It won't be hard for a beautiful girl like you to find a lover.

147
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:23,246
All right.

148
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:28,466
I'll go now. Don't leave too late.

149
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:30,266
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

150
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,193
Please come back already. I miss you.

151
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,679
Who do you miss?

152
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:17,589
Is it me?

153
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:22,149
I miss you so much, Boss!

154
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:24,919
I missed you too, Nezumi-san.

155
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,507
Well then...

156
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,048
Let me help you get over missing me.

157
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:02,409
Nim-san?

158
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,374
You should go home.

159
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:13,329
- Okay. Let me gather my things.
- Sure.

160
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,839
Goodbye.

161
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,100
<i>[Did you have a good sleep last night?]
[Is it very cold there?] [Don't you miss me?]</i>

162
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,780
<i>[How is work?] [Don't forget to have your meal.]
[How are you? I'm worried.]</i>

163
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,679
Nong Nim!

164
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,189
Yes? P'Ting, did you need something?

165
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:13,039
It's nothing. I just noticed that you're looking unwell.

166
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,351
Are you sick?

167
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:19,512
I'm not. I'm all right.

168
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:23,022
Since Boss is away now, you should also take some rest.

169
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:28,519
Since Boss is away, there is nobody to look at.

170
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,549
That's true.

171
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:35,212
Although there's no pressure, but since there's no eye candy, I feel dispirited.

172
00:16:35,212 --> 00:16:40,159
Here. If you want eye candy, Instagram can help.

173
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,245
Right, that's true. I forgot that Boss has an Instagram account as well.

174
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,339
He hasn't posted any photo for so long.

175
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,009
What's going on?

176
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,839
How come I didn't know that Boss also has an Instagram account?

177
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,249
P'Ting, how could you miss that?

178
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:01,169
I'm someone who they call nosey with a limit!

179
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:04,859
Wow, he has hundreds of followers.

180
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,619
He only posted photos of beautiful scenery.

181
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,110
He's truly worthy of being the Boss.

182
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,619
He once posted a photo with a girl too, but that was a long time ago.

183
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,719
I think it was when he was in Japan.

184
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:20,139
Really? Is that his girlfriend?

185
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:25,049
I'm not sure, but it's the person we all know.

186
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,179
Oh, I knew it. There's no smoke without fire.

187
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,399
There must be something between Boss and Rena-san.

188
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:36,719
These two make a perfect couple.

189
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:41,549
She's the only person he posted on his Instagram. Even if he didn't announce it, it's like an introduction.

190
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:47,572
Who knows, maybe they're enjoying sweet moments on this trip to Korea.

191
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,839
I'm back.

192
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:19,369
Why do you look like that? Are you sick?

193
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:22,947
I'm not. I'm just feeling tired.

194
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:25,062
This is how a Japanese company works.

195
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,852
They overwork you.

196
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:32,921
It's not like that. It's just during this time.

197
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:37,719
Go, go, go. Wash up and hurry to sleep.

198
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:41,169
Tomorrow is Saturday, you can rest all day long.

199
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:43,029
All right.

200
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,270
Hey. You're eating it all. Share some with me.

201
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,110
- Look at you, just eating it all alone.
- What do you do first, Mom?

202
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,649
- Hey! You better watch it.
- I'm just kidding.

203
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:58,039
I can't reach that.

204
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,769
See? You're coughing.

205
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,309
Hello?

206
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,509
<i>What's wrong with your voice?</i>

207
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,639
<i>It's me, Akitsuki.</i>

208
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,579
<i>I lost my phone in Korea on the first day,</i>

209
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:29,819
<i>and I had been busy, so I didn't call you.</i>

210
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:35,700
<i>I'm sorry. I just landed, so I'm using Hazobe's phone to call.</i>

211
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,699
<i>Don't save his number.</i>

212
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,999
<i>Nezumi?</i>

213
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:44,505
<i>Are you listening?</i>

214
00:20:44,505 --> 00:20:46,262
Yes.

215
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:50,140
Did you call me because something was up?

216
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,867
Or is there no car to pick you up from the airport?

217
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:58,809
But Hazobe-san's car is parked there.

218
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,695
<i>Do I need to have an urgent matter to call my girlfriend?</i>

219
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:12,739
I haven't talked to you for many days.

220
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:18,049
As soon as I arrived, I confiscated Hazobe's phone to call you first.

221
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:22,399
But you're asking me if I needed something.

222
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:24,523
That's so upsetting.

223
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,380
Nezumi, are you angry with me?

224
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:40,459
I'm not.

225
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:44,679
I'm sorry I've been away for so long.

226
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:48,115
I missed you.

227
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,345
That's not fair!

228
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,919
You should be used to it already.

229
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,551
And... as punishment for keeping you waiting for many days,

230
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:05,685
I've prepared a souvenir to make it up to you.

231
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,079
I'll wait to see it on Monday then.

232
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,489
No.

233
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,410
Tomorrow is Saturday. Are you free?

234
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:19,803
Are you not?

235
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:22,369
I-I-I'm free.

236
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:25,209
Then let's meet up.

237
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,349
Where are we going?

238
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:35,283
I'll take you out for a meal,

239
00:22:35,283 --> 00:22:38,684
to make it up to you for having kept you waiting for many days.

240
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:44,590
So this...

241
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,260
is a date.

242
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,300
If you say so, then it is.

243
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:57,400
See you tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. then.

244
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,830
Yes.

245
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:06,420
♫ <i>Can you do that? Can't you do that?</i> ♫

246
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,670
This is crazy!

247
00:24:57,969 --> 00:25:00,200
Nezumi,

248
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,010
will you keep standing there any longer?

249
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,550
Just because I'm not dressed for work, you can't recognize me?

250
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,549
That's right. I didn't recognize you.

251
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:21,012
I thought I had a new boyfriend.

252
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:25,979
You're getting better at talking.

253
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,684
Let's go.

254
00:25:28,684 --> 00:25:31,103
It's super hot here.

255
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,394
Are you still scared?

256
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,670
Last time when we held hands...

257
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,582
It's all right.

258
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,835
I already picked a place that is extremely far from our office.

259
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:07,329
Besides, I already disguised myself like this.

260
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:16,812
Boss, are you calling a tee and a pair of jeans a disguise?

261
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:23,317
The person who's going to ruin it is you.

262
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:28,454
You're still calling me Boss.

263
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:33,104
Do lovers call each other like this?

264
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:46,599
Do you really feel upset?

265
00:26:49,556 --> 00:26:51,599
Think about it.

266
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:57,325
If your lover doesn't even call you by your name, how would you feel?

267
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:34,059
See? It feels so good holding hands like this.

268
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:51,192
Which one is better?

269
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:56,199
Just go with the one you prefer.

270
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,253
Then... this one.

271
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:04,736
I meant the phones.

272
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,699
You've lost your mobile phone, haven't you?

273
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:10,041
I can buy it for you. Do you want one?

274
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:15,979
- I don't want it.
- Why?

275
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:18,505
Mine is still working fine,

276
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:24,069
and I don't want to pay installments. I don't want to be in debt. I'll be flat broke.

277
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,046
I don't want money.

278
00:28:26,046 --> 00:28:30,588
But I might want something else from you.

279
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,219
People will hear what you said! What are you saying?

280
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,309
That's their business.

281
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:48,469
- Excuse me, I want to buy this one.
- Yes?

282
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:54,879
Thank you.

283
00:28:55,722 --> 00:28:57,369
What kind of first date is this?

284
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,794
You're bringing me here to buy a mobile phone?

285
00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:04,170
No. Our first date begins after this.

286
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:02,552
What are you doing?

287
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:08,701
Nothing. I'm just checking whether you're sleeping yet.

288
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:17,149
I'm just resting my eyes.

289
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,029
I'm still a bit tired from traveling.

290
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:01,559
<i>The movie was fun, wasn't it? Someone kept crying alone, though.</i>

291
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,446
Weren't you sleeping?

292
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,365
I told you I was just resting my eyes.

293
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:10,269
I saw everything.

294
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:15,839
I also saw you shedding your tears on my shirt.

295
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,599
I didn't do that!

296
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:28,256
Are you hungry? Should we grab something to eat here?

297
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:33,897
I want to eat the dish you cook.

298
00:31:33,897 --> 00:31:35,349
Pardon?

299
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:40,099
I went to Korea for a week,

300
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:44,399
so I didn't get to eat your lunchbox.

301
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:51,980
Besides, the souvenir I've prepared for you is still at my place.

302
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,005
I see.

303
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,143
You mean you want me to cook for you at your place?

304
00:31:59,143 --> 00:32:00,919
That's correct.

305
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,854
You're smart.

306
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:06,131
It would be bad if I didn't catch on.

307
00:32:06,131 --> 00:32:09,171
It's your plan to trap me into going to your place.

308
00:32:09,937 --> 00:32:11,470
So...

309
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,010
will you agree to be trapped?

Nezumi,

do you want some?

345
00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:12,399
No. I'm cooking.

346
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:14,539
Let's drink together.

347
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:18,098
Are you going to get me drunk?

348
00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:20,421
You're on to me again.

349
00:36:20,421 --> 00:36:22,809
Will you allow me to do so?

350
00:36:25,053 --> 00:36:26,853
Sure.

351
00:36:28,983 --> 00:36:30,790
But...

352
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,340
I have a knife here.

Aren't you scared?

354

You're all talk and no action.

357
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:04,753
Go sit first.

358

Hold on. I'll wipe it off for you.

Hello, Mom.

378
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,953
Why didn't you let me know you are back? Why did you tiptoe?

379
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:15,820
I didn't tiptoe. I just didn't want to be loud.

380
