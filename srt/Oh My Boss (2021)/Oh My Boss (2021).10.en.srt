1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,920
<i>Your boss was quite harsh on me.</i>

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,786
<i>Your boss reported it to my company,</i>

3
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:05,610
<i>which led me to being heavily interrogated.</i>

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,520
<i>It seems like you trust Akitsuki-san a lot.</i>

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,700
<i>Are you sure you really know him well enough?</i>

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,655
<i>I miss you so much, Boss!</i>

7
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:16,680
<i>I missed you too, Nezumi-san.</i>

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,187
<i>Well then...</i>

9
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:22,732
<i>Let me help you get over missing me.</i>

10
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:27,813
<i>I lost my phone in Korea on the first day.</i>

11
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:30,680
<i>Then let's meet up.</i>

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,650
<i>So this... is a date.</i>

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,266
<i>See? It feels so good holding hands like this.</i>

14
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:42,330
<i>What kind of first date is this? You're bringing me here to buy a mobile phone?</i>

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,927
<i>Our first date begins after this.</i>

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,075
<i>- You mean you want me to cook for you at your place?
- That's correct.</i>

17
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:55,880
<i>It's your plan to trap me into going to your place.</i>

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,389
<i>Boss, what are you doing?!</i>

19
00:00:57,389 --> 00:01:00,783
<i>Koji-san, there's a mark!</i>

20
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,650
<i>[Boss, Please Don't Flirt | Oh My Boss]</i>

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,790
♫ <i>Do you think you're the only one who feels this way</i> ♫

22
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,860
♫ <i>What you feel in your heart</i> ♫

23
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:33,080
‎♫ <i>Do you think that I don't feel the same</i> ♫

24
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,750
‎♫ <i>Is it okay to only think like that</i> ♫

25
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,640
‎♫ <i>Why are you keeping it to yourself</i> ♫

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,890
‎♫ <i>Tell me what you're thinking, no need to wait</i> ♫

27
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:57,210
♫ <i>I can't see clearly if you love me or if you're just lonely</i> ♫

28
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,242
What's wrong with your neck?

29
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:04,320
Mom, whose car is in front of our house?

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,940
It's P'Nut's car. Aunt Nui sold it to me cheap because she needed quick cash.

31
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,890
And P'Nut has been wanting one for a while.

32
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,440
What would P'Nut need a car for?

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,842
For work.

34
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:21,324
He and his friends will work as sales reps and travel from place to place.

35
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:22,980
It's more convenient for him to have a car.

36
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,550
Where did you get the money to buy him a car?

37
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,695
You don't have to worry about that.

38
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:30,270
We already have a mortgage to pay, and now we have to pay for his car too?

39
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,370
When he makes some money from selling stuff, he'll pay off his car himself.

40
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,905
You don't have to worry.

41
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,191
How can I not worry?

42
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,297
Why didn't you ask me first?

43
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:44,204
I told you that you don't have to get involved.

44
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:46,010
P'Nut and I will handle it.

45
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,130
P'Nut just started working. Where would he get the money to pay for the car?

46
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,000
Besides, do you really think he will be successful in sales?

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,586
Don't talk about your older brother like that.

48
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:03,598
I'm telling you to stay out of it. Mind your own business.

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,006
For this project, the client wants us to provide a full-option service.

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,236
<i>Hold on. I'll wipe it off for you. Close your eyes.</i>

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,080
Don't!

52
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,590
I mean, please don't turn up the AC.

53
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,195
I'm feeling cold today.

54
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,460
Okay.

55
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,370
For the media buying team,

56
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,560
this is the annual media plan finalized by the client.

57
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:21,573
Please schedule ads according to it.

58
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,035
Uh...

59
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:32,740
The client also wants the lead time and the requirements,

60
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,730
like file and image sizes,

61
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:40,900
and the character count

62
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,830
for the editorials. And...

63
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,450
Noom Nim-san,

64
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,494
are you sick? You keep touching your scarf today.

65
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,022
Yes, I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

66
00:04:57,022 --> 00:05:00,511
It must have been the rain.

67
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:04,928
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:07,020
Take care of yourself.

69
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,993
Get something to eat after this meeting.

70
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:12,480
Would you like some soup?

71
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,323
No!

72
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,650
I mean, no, thank you.

73
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,990
Because...

74
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,280
But there's no need to worry.

75
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,190
I won't go anywhere near the source of this problem again.

76
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,648
You mean germs?

77
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:37,802
Exactly. It's the germs.

78
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:42,106
Excuse me, are you two fighting?

79
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:44,291
- No.
- No, no.

80
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,786
Please continue. We have wasted so much time talking about germs.

81
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,497
All right. Next is about our influencer.

82
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,770
Nakamura Kimono Shop

83
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,580
has confirmed the date, time, and concept.

84
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,655
Noom Nim-san, is my lunch ready?

85
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:23,915
Yes. Just a moment, please.

86
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,759
Are you waiting for me, Boss?

87
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,013
What are you doing? Why are you hugging me?

88
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:53,704
It looked like you were waiting for a hug, so I complied.

89
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,011
What do you want?

90
00:06:56,011 --> 00:06:59,750
Noom Nim-chan asked me to tell you to wait a little bit.

91
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,226
Aren't you making your secretary work too hard?

92
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:06,349
If this one also quits, I won't help you find a new one again.

93
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,649
You can work alone.

94
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,613
Is that all?

95
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:16,442
If there's nothing else, leave me alone.

96
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,584
See you.

97
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,742
She's taking so long.

98
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:29,795
I want to remind you about this afternoon's meeting.

99
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:32,380
I won't take any more of your lunch break.

100
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,970
All right.

101
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,790
Won't I get to see Nezumi-san at all today?

102
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,640
Do you want me to punch you?

103
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,270
Oh... Are... you going to punch me? I'm sorry.

104
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,817
Oh, no.

105
00:07:56,817 --> 00:08:00,964
I thought Hazobe-san was going to pop in again.

106
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:04,826
You're so late, Nezumi-san.

107
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:07,346
I'm starving.

108
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,346
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:14,537
I was making you a glass of juice.

110
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:17,624
If you're hungry, please eat.

111
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:22,153
Feed me.

112
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,183
You had no problem eating by yourself before. Why do I have to feed you now?

113
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:28,763
Hurry.

114
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:33,503
Or do you want me to eat something else?

115
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,529
Hey! Why are you such a pervert?

116
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,520
I didn't expect you to be like this.

117
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,960
You were a calm gentleman before.

118
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,033
What's your problem?

119
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:49,548
Don't bully me.

120
00:08:49,548 --> 00:08:52,146
I'm busy today.

121
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,957
Stop.

122
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:08,940
Feed me. Come on.

123
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,840
I'm hungry. Why won't you feed me?

124
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,186
Fine.

125
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,780
Mr. President, the client is here and waiting in the conference room.

126
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,955
All right.

127
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:33,580
Then I'll go and prepare the documents.

128
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,520
Gosh!

129
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,150
I haven't even eaten yet, and I have to get back to work already?

130
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,770
When did you become so whiny?

131
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:50,716
Since I have you.

132
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,548
All right.

133
00:10:08,548 --> 00:10:13,390
After we launched the matcha biscuit campaign,

134
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,660
we've received great feedback.

135
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:16,580
The customers love it.

136
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,552
Our customer base has expanded.

137
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,340
We're doing really great at targeting teenagers.

138
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,036
I must give the credit to Akitsuki-san.

139
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,390
Mr. Wilson asked who helped me with this project,

140
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,070
so I recommended your team to him.

141
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:36,880
From now on,

142
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,030
you will be responsible for both of his offline and online ads.

143
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:45,756
He'll give you more details. Thank you.

144
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:55,996
Hello, I'm Wilson.

145
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:58,792
Nezumi-san,

146
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:02,388
why is Khun Mark giving my company a project?

147
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,327
Isn't it suspicious?

148
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,860
How?

149
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,464
He doesn't even like me.

150
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,650
I don't know.

151
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,388
Hold on.

152
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Was what I did so unforgivable

153
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,820
that you had to avoid me?

154
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,449
I wasn't.

155
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:52,196
I was just getting back to work.

156
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:55,452
Where's your boss?

157
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:57,511
He's sending Mr. Wilson off

158
00:11:57,511 --> 00:12:01,080
and probably discussing with him some more.

159
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,120
It looks like you and your boss are still angry at me.

160
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,204
I thought we had already cleared the air.

161
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,408
We did.

162
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:16,124
I'm not angry anymore.

163
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:19,943
Good. If you're not angry anymore,

164
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,680
do you want to go get something to eat with me?

165
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:27,652
I'm just kidding.

166
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:30,100
Could you make me a cup of tea?

167
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,168
Sure.

168
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,720
Hold on.

169
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,490
Akitsuki-san did this, didn't he?

170
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,408
He's still the same and hasn't changed.

171
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:49,503
You're lucky it was me who saw it.

172
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,752
Cover it up before other people see it and gossip.

173
00:12:54,752 --> 00:12:56,780
Nezumi-san,

174
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,859
come with me right now.

175
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:18,544
Boss, nothing is going on between me and Khun Mark.

176
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:21,200
Do you know what I'm thinking?

177
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,171
I can tell by the look in your eyes.

178
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:29,519
You're misunderstanding me.

179
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:35,416
Look into my eyes now. And see what I'm thinking.

180
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,783
Stop. I don't want to hear it.

181
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,860
♫ <i>My baby</i> ♫

182
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,540
♫ <i>My baby</i> ♫

183
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,650
♫ <i>My baby</i> ♫

184
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,280
♫ <i>My baby</i> ♫

185
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,420
This is just a punishment.

186
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,892
You crazy man.

187
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,310
Why do you always like doing this?

188
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,700
Are you a pervert?

189
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,732
I'm a big pervert.

190
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:05,080
That's enough.

191
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,720
You and your perverted thoughts.

192
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,048
I'm only a pervert when it comes to you.

193
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:14,944
Oh,

194
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:18,068
I won't talk to you anymore.

195
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,680
If you don't want me to do this,

196
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,800
then promise me

197
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,080
that you won't be alone with any guy again.

198
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,084
No matter who he is,

199
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:35,164
or I will do this to you again.

200
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,772
What if it's Hazobe-san?

201
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,772
No.

202
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:44,555
- What about Minei-san?
- No.

203
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,440
- What about the security guy?
- Still a no.

204
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,460
Are you jealous?

205
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,970
Yes.

206
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:03,976
Any more questions?

207
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,732
No.

208
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,568
If you know I'm jealous,

209
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:18,460
don't act cute in front of others.

210
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,120
Otherwise...

211
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,184
Will you keep doing that without giving me a warning?

212
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:32,900
Yes.

213
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:44,208
Don't you want me to kiss you first for a change?

214
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,906
Mom, has P'Nut started working yet?

215
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,530
Yes, of course.

216
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,224
He works as a salesman.

217
00:17:58,224 --> 00:18:01,640
He stocks those products for sale.

218
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,440
But where did he get the money to invest?

219
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,544
He borrowed a little money from your aunt.

220
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:14,999
Don't worry. Once he sells all of those items, he will be able to pay her back.

221
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,720
We have to be careful. Many people get tricked these days.

222
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,660
He bought a whole lot of products. What if he can't sell them? How will he pay Auntie back?

223
00:18:26,448 --> 00:18:31,164
Nim, try to trust other people for once.

224
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:35,604
Do you think you're the only smart person in this house?

225
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:39,670
If you're worried about money that much, you can relax

226
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:44,060
because I won't ask for more of your money than I already have.

227
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,332
Mom, I'm not...

228
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:04,744
<i>Water bill: 500 baht.</i>

229
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,379
<i>Electricity bill: 4,500 baht.</i>

230
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,138
<i>How are we using that much electricity?</i>

231
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:11,992
<i>Insurance: 12,000 baht.</i>

232
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:17,035
<i>Mom's mobile phone bill: 990 baht. Internet bill: 899 baht.</i>

233
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,456
<i>P'Nut's mobile phone bill: 1,200 baht.</i>

234
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:25,192
<i>Why do I have to pay for him? I'm his younger sister.</i>

235
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,450
Can I get a glass of water, please?

236
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,320
Sure.

237
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,939
Are you all right? You look stressed since I came in.

238
00:19:58,048 --> 00:20:00,012
I'm fine.

239
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,393
And you?

240
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:07,136
How are you? Are you busy?

241
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:12,260
I am. There are a lot of new joiners, and a new boss from Japan is coming.

242
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,580
I have to prepare the Non-B visa application,

243
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:20,290
documents for BOI and work permit. It's so chaotic.

244
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,060
A Japanese colleague is moving here?

245
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,556
What's that person's position? Boss hasn't told me anything.

246
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:31,652
The headquarters' HR department contacted me directly.

247
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:33,063
They didn't go through our Boss.

248
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:36,440
I think that person has a big position.

249
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,452
Would we have to send someone from our team to help theirs,

250
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:42,920
or are they just going to backfill the position?

251
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,776
It's too late to hire someone new.

252
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:49,875
I guess we will have to move one of our people there, at least for a while.

253
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,504
Anyway, it will be a little tough for you.

254
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:56,796
During meetings, I think you'll have to translate for the new boss too.

255
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,220
Sorry, I ranted too much.

256
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,816
I should go.

257
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:03,584
Wait, P'Ja Oh.

258
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:04,984
Yes?

259
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:09,956
I have a question.

260
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:16,010
I have passed the probation now, right?

261
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:20,016
I totally forgot. You passed your probation.

262
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:21,756
Right.

263
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,070
That's why I wanted to ask

264
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,140
about the pay raise we discussed.

265
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,981
Is it going to be effective this month?

266
00:21:31,981 --> 00:21:37,343
Boss will make that decision. I think you could ask him directly.

267
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:40,932
I have to talk to him myself?

268
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,572
Yes, go for it.

269
00:21:42,572 --> 00:21:46,500
Boss is kind to you. You have nothing to worry about.

270
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,200
I must go.

271
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,200
<i>Boss. Boss.</i>

272
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,707
Boss. I would like to ask for...

273
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,828
What's wrong Nezumi-san?

274
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,340
Is your silence a signal that we should go to the storage room?

275
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,740
And you said I'm a pervert.

276
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,000
You are a bad one yourself.

277
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:28,403
Hmm. But we don't have time to go there right now.

278
00:22:28,403 --> 00:22:32,228
We have a meeting with a salesperson about the venue.

279
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,114
- Right.
- Or...

280
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:39,131
we could spare 10 minutes.

281
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:41,692
What do you say?

282
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:44,020
Let's hurry and go to work.

283
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:47,040
You're smart.

284
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,080
You're afraid if we leave later, we'll be stuck in traffic, right?

285
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,876
Come.

286
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,331
Okay.

287
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:04,223
Coming!

288
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,856
So this area is connected to the sky train station.

289
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:16,270
I recommend it because you'll get a lot of visibility from people.

290
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:22,490
Our pricing is a flat rate of 400,000 baht per day.

291
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,820
Is another company going to help

292
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,470
your agency organize the event or

293
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,404
are you going to do it in-house?

294
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,970
Khun Nim?

295
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:43,200
Sorry. Can you repeat that again?

296
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,210
Sure. I was just asking if you and Khun Koji

297
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,030
would use an event organizer

298
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,980
or keep it in-house?

299
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,920
We have our own event team.

300
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:02,160
Okay. Once you've decided, we can talk about the price again later.

301
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,940
Of course. Thank you.

302
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:09,120
I won't take any more of your time. Bye. Bye.

303
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,459
Is something wrong? You seem distracted.

304
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:21,196
Nezumi, are you hungry?

305
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:27,208
A little, but I can wait until after work.

306
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:32,042
Why? We're at the mall. Let's eat now.

307
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:35,868
No. I don't like eating when I'm on the clock working.

308
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:38,310
It feels too rushed.

309
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:43,548
Have you never done it?

310
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,510
Then as your Boss,

311
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:52,240
I order you to stop working now.

312
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:53,947
What?

313
00:24:58,258 --> 00:25:02,256
Right now, Boss Koji has left.

314
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,570
There's only Nezumi's boyfriend Koji left here.

315
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:13,149
Can we get something to eat now?

316
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,850
Go ahead. Feel free to order anything you want.

317
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,172
Or you can eat me.

318
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,076
No.

319
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:34,787
Why not? What's the problem?

320
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,184
I said no.

321
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:42,152
Fine.

322
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,680
Let's see.

323
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,478
I'm so hungry.
<i>[Aunt Nui]</i>

324
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,084
Excuse me.

325
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:15,280
Hello.

326
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,452
<i>Hello, is this Nim?</i>

327
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,500
Yes.

328
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,808
<i>It's Auntie Nui.</i>

329
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:22,820
Yes, Auntie. What's the matter?

330
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,690
<i>I didn't want to trouble you because</i>

331
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,510
<i>your mom asked me not to tell you.</i>

332
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,244
What?

333
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,988
<i>Your mom borrowed my money to make a down payment on a car.</i>

334
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:40,400
<i>She said she'd pay a part of it back at the end of the month. But I still haven't received anything back.</i>

335
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,540
<i>When I asked her, she kept telling me to wait.</i>

336
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:47,004
<i>I'm not asking her to pay all of it back right now, but my child needs money urgently.</i>

337
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:50,450
<i>Do you have some money to pay me back now?</i>

338
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,940
<i>A part of it will be fine.</i>

339
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:54,956
<i>Do you have it?</i>

340
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:56,752
<i>Are you listening?</i>

341
00:26:56,752 --> 00:26:58,712
Yes, I am.

342
00:26:58,712 --> 00:27:01,880
<i>You don't have to pay 300,000 baht back right away.</i>

343
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,308
<i>Just 100,000 will be fine.</i>

344
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,530
I'm working right now. Can I call you back?

345
00:27:16,392 --> 00:27:22,280
<i>Sure. Please help me. I'm in trouble, too.</i>

346
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,070
Okay.

347
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,824
Sorry.

348
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,652
Is something wrong?

349
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,930


350
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,854
It's Masashi-san.

351
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:57,605
Excuse me.

352
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:02,432
Hello.

353
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,470
Really?

354
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,640
Is that so?

355
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,890
Understood.

356
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,550
Okay.

357
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,556
Is something wrong?

358
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:29,920
Masashi-san said the headquarters might cut our budget by half.

359
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,352
It will be really bad if it's true.

360
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,636
Anyway, what were you going to say?

361
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:49,460
It's nothing.

362
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:55,160
It's really nothing. Let's order some food.

363
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:06,400
<i>This is not a good time to talk about money. Poor me!</i>

364
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,500
<i>[Credit Card Statement]</i>

365
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,420
<i>[Bank Balance]</i>

366
00:29:41,768 --> 00:29:44,520
Is the workload a lot?

367
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,740
You were quite startled. What were you doing in secret?

368
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,855
I'm sure it's a side job.

369
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:53,183
No. It's not.

370
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,856
Can I help you with anything?

371
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,105
Who would dare make the CEO's secretary do something without permission?

372
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:07,560
I was going to ask if you wanted to join us for lunch.

373
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:13,976
There's a new barbecue place opposite the company, which looks so good.

374
00:30:13,976 --> 00:30:18,384
It's only 1,299 baht per person,

375
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:21,680
but there's a "Come 4 Pay 3" promotion at the moment.

376
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,796
So we'll pay about 975 each.

377
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:29,176
Less than 1,000 baht, Nong Noom Nim.

378
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:33,904
<i>- 1,000 baht for 1 meal. I can't afford it.</i>
- Do you want to go? Please join us.

379
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,572
You guys go. I'm not very hungry.

380
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:44,804
And I have to finish this up.

381
00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:47,528
Okay. I'll leave you to it.

382
00:30:47,528 --> 00:30:49,809
Text me if you want anything.

383
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:50,910
Okay. Thanks.

384
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,948
- See you later.
- Yes.

385
00:31:06,045 --> 00:31:07,827
What are you doing?

386
00:31:11,044 --> 00:31:12,944
Boss!

387
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:24,520
So you've been hiding here. What are you doing?

388
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,672
Do you need anything?

389
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,960
I've come to invite you to do what couples do.

390
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,376
No, I don't want people to find out we go to that room together.

391
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,290
What are you talking about?

392
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,020
I'm asking you to go eat with me.

393
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,248
Why are you thinking about that room?

394
00:31:51,248 --> 00:31:55,790
Anyway, we can go after lunch.

395
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,020
We need to fill up our energy first.

396
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,130
Can we go already?

397
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,010
I'm hungry.

398
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:16,980
But I'm not. I'm on a diet.

399
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,776
On a diet?

400
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,624
You're not fat.

401
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:27,050
Your body looks great. I like it.

402
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,700
Stop.

403
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,784
- I'm going.
- Where are you going?

404
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:37,159
You don't have to go.

405
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:38,759
No.

406
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,010
I have a lot of work to do.

407
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,630
Go eat with me first.

408
00:32:43,788 --> 00:32:45,688
Bye bye.

409
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:18,220
Get your stuff and follow me. We're going out.

410
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:26,360
What's wrong? You look tired.

411
00:33:34,704 --> 00:33:37,756
We rarely get to eat together anymore.

412
00:33:37,756 --> 00:33:41,580
Do you want to go shopping for ingredients and cook at my place?

413
00:33:44,307 --> 00:33:49,723
I'd love to, but I'm so tired. I think I'll go home and sleep.

414
00:33:49,723 --> 00:33:51,423
Okay.

415
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,470
Nezumi.

416
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,120
Yes?

417
00:34:23,992 --> 00:34:26,004
What happened?

418
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,340
I can tell that you're feeling more stressed than usual.

419
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:42,804
I'm just tired. That's why I want to sleep all day.

420
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:39,650
Akitsuki Koji.

421
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,688
Hello.

422
00:36:49,688 --> 00:36:55,050
Is that Koji's wife, Nezumi?

423
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:59,170
No. We're not together.

424
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,760
Really?

425
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,452
How will you explain what happened at the office, at my condo,

426
00:37:05,452 --> 00:37:09,112
in the storage room, or in my car then?

427
00:37:09,112 --> 00:37:11,596
Don't tease me.

428
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:19,508
What are you doing?

429
00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:21,370
Have you gone to bed?

430
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,365
Not yet. I'm about to take a shower.

431
00:37:29,365 --> 00:37:31,496
What about you?

432
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:37,200
Hello? Boss?

433
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,280
Yes?

434
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,720
You're home already, right?

435
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,920
I just got home.

436
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,720
Oh.

437
00:37:54,657 --> 00:37:57,763
Is something wrong? Why are you quiet.

438
00:38:01,272 --> 00:38:03,185
It's nothing.

439
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:10,591
I won't take any more of your time. See you tomorrow.

440
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:12,799
Okay.

441
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:17,824
I'll make you your favorite lunchbox tomorrow.

442
00:38:18,972 --> 00:38:20,365
Okay.

443
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:24,807
I'll be waiting. Sweet dreams.

444
00:38:57,779 --> 00:39:02,851
<i>Do you know how shocked I was seeing you pass out in front of my eyes?</i>

445
00:39:02,851 --> 00:39:05,259
<i>I'm seriously worried about you, Nezumi-san.</i>

446
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:10,295
<i>I already warned you before not to trust any guy that much, especially a foreigner.</i>

447
00:39:10,295 --> 00:39:12,287
<i>Drink your milk first.</i>

448
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:13,911
<i>I'll go upstairs to arrange the bed for you.</i>

449
00:39:13,911 --> 00:39:16,707
<i>You don't need to.</i>

450
00:39:16,707 --> 00:39:18,579
<i>I can sleep on the sofa.</i>

451
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:20,339
<i>You're going to sleep in my room.</i>

452
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:22,047
<i>I will sleep on the sofa.</i>

453
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:24,607
<i>I can't sleep. I'm not familiar with the place.</i>

454
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:27,450
<i>Let's watch it together then.</i>

455
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:34,369
<i>If anyone sees us arriving at the office together,</i>

456
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:36,627
<i>they will gossip.</i>

457
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:39,703
<i>Why are you afraid of people gossiping?</i>

458
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:41,330
<i>That's because I'm worried about you.</i>

459
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,893
<i>Can you stay here with me for one more night?</i>

460
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:45,614
