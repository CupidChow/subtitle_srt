It's okay. I can take a taxi home.

22
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,943
Please don't feel burdened, Noom Nim-san. Just think of me as a driver.

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,560
Then I will sit in the front with you, Hazobe-san.

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,060
It is an honor.

25
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,327
No.

26
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,863
Noom Nim-san can sit in the back. I will sit in the front.

27
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,200
Why? The back seat is more comfortable.

28
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,200
I want to sit in the front today. Why?

29
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,200
By the way, where do you live, Noom Nim-san?

30
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,220
I live near Lat Phrao district.

31
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,900
I'll drop off Boss first, then Noom Nim-san, so we don't go back and forth.

32
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,820
No, drop her off first.

33
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,880
Why are you making me go back and forth?

34
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,040
Don't ask too much.

35
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,060
Just drive.

36
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,080
How was the contract signing? Did it go well?

37
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,260
We almost failed.

38
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,060
At first, the president wouldn't sign with us.

39
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,920
Luckily, someone turned him around and saved the day.

40
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,503
Really? Who?

41
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:48,089
I heard he wouldn't sign with anyone easily.

42
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:51,400
What did you do to convince him?

43
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,020
Try asking Noom Nim-san.

44
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,903
I didn't do anything. I just...

45
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,240
Take a look at this.

46
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,600
You even filmed it?

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,680
You're so funny, Noom Nim-san.

48
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,760
Do you now have the answer about how we got the contract?

49
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,940
I get it now.

50
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,720
You're amazing, Noom Nim-san.

51
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,290
When Boss told me he was looking for a secretary,

52
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,440
I was afraid that you'd fight with each other.

53
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,580
Because in Thailand, Boss is as tough as the president of Kirei.

54
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm not that good. I almost got him in trouble.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,610
Don't worry. If you can remedy the issues, I have no problems with it.

56
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,200
Wow, so stern.

57
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,580
Do you believe me now, Noom Nim-san?

58
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,840
Have you told the headquarters that everything went well?

59
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,120
It's been taken care of.

60
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,240
Now we just have to kick off the project next month.

61
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,520
You work hard. You should take a break.

62
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,600
If there's anything you think is difficult and you can't manage,

63
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,980
just let it go.

64
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,200
The headquarters is asking too much of you, you know?

65
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,100
What can I do?

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,380
I'm in no place to decide what should be done.

67
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,860
Please just drive. I'm going to sleep a bit.

68
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm feeling a little dizzy and tired.

69
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,680
Why are there two boxes?

70
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:23,911
I made one for dinner.

71
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:27,011
I get off late these days.

72
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm off to work.

73
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,920
Yes?

74
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,580
What can I do for you?

75
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,440
I just wanted to ask

76
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,880
if you've prepared for the influencer marketing meeting this morning.

77
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Yes. Don't worry. We're good to go.

78
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,480
And...

79
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,360
Yes?

80
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,640
Why did you bring two lunches?

81
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,860
I think we should get ready for the meeting.

82
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,430
It's almost time.

83
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,240
I'll get ready now.

84
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,120
Before we start today's meeting, I have some wonderful news.

85
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,123
ViperX has signed a contract with Kirei.

86
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:30,243
The total budget for this project is 20 million baht.

87
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:34,700
I would like to give credit to my secretary.

88
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,680
Please give her a big hand.

89
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,990
I'll turn it over to Minei-san.

90
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,820
For the matcha biscuit project, Khun Mark wants everything done by this month.

91
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,688
He urged that he wanted to see the overview proposal by this week.

92
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:58,588
I apologize for interrupting the meeting, but there is a client here to see you.

93
00:08:58,588 --> 00:08:59,683
Tell them to wait.

94
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:03,983
You're still as strict as ever, Akitsuki-san.

95
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,800
Hello, Khun Mark.

96
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,380
You should have told me you were coming so I could prepare for your arrival.

97
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,480
It's all right. Aren't you discussing my project at the moment?

98
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,340
Let me join.

99
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,603
Of course. Please have a seat.

100
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,680
Let's continue.

101
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,840
I think you guys are very slow in doing what I asked.

102
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,120
I want to launch this product already.

103
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,156
But if you're not okay with it,

104
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:58,867
I have no problem holding it off for another three months.

105
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:04,267
You don't have to worry about that. I can meet your deadlines.

106
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:07,483
That's good. Now let's hear your ideas.

107
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,180
The team is researching different types of green tea

108
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,600
to find the best aspects to highlight in our ad.

109
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,770
Nutrition, health,

110
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,440
and benefits, again?

111
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,780
Is that what ViperX's creative team came up with?

112
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,080
Is that all they can come up with?

113
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,960
It was my idea.

114
00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:48,343
That fact that it was your idea is even more disappointing.

115
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,180
I don't like it.

116
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,260
Was this the best you could think of?

117
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,600
I don't care about health.

118
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,840
I'm only thinking of one thing, it has to sell.

119
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,620
The only thing that matters is if it will sell or not.

120
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,341
Don't you have anything more unique and fresh?

121
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,000
I mean I was expecting to be surprised today.

122
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,260
May I propose something?

123
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:33,220
If you don't want to talk more about the benefits of green tea,

124
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:39,020
I think maybe we could focus on getting the right presenter.

125
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:44,060
Since our target groups changed to working professionals and teenagers,

126
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,040
finding a cute and lively presenter

127
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,520
with a Japanese style would be nice.

128
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,720
And because we're launching the product in the summer,

129
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,280
a beach theme would be cute.

130
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,600
What do you think, Khun Mark?

131
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,180
That is interesting.

132
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,200
I think that the idea is interesting, and we should try it.

133
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,580
Sure. We will send you a few candidates so you can choose the presenter.

134
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:38,100
I've already thought about whom I want as the presenter,

135
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,910
but I'm not sure if Akitsuki-san...

136
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,900
will approve.

Excuse me...

00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,003
who is Khun Mark?

Oh my god. You don't know him?

142
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't know him. I just met him for the first time in the meeting.

143
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,940
I'm telling you, everyone here knows who he is.

144
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,340
He's a famous major client and a big shot.

145
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,760
A big shot?

146
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,460
Yes, he's a handsome, young, and ultrarich CEO.

147
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,780
If we compare his capabilities with our boss's, they are on the same level.

148
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,900
He's a huge womanizer.

149
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,360
He dates women and tosses them away like used tissue papers,

150
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,920
but he's the most detail-orientated guy when it comes to work.

151
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,540
I'm sure he's trying to make it difficult for Boss

152
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,980
by appointing his ex as the presenter.

153
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,480
His ex?

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,920
Is there anything I can help you with?

162
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,010
Yes, I'm hungry.

163
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,840
Okay. What would you like to eat? I'll place an order.

164
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,220
I'll eat the bento that you've prepared for me.

165
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,820
This?

166
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,360
I prepared this to eat myself.

167
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,140
I eat a lot these days.

168
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,800
I need two boxes.

169
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,520
Um-hum.

170
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,520
So what can I order for you?

171
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,680
I don't want to eat anymore.

172
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:26,700
Don't forget to make the summary and write a meeting report.

173
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,480
- Send them to my email.
- Sure.

174
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,177
Okay. You can go.

175
00:16:31,177 --> 00:16:34,623
Nong Nim, haven't you gone home yet?

176
00:16:34,623 --> 00:16:40,720
I just need to get Boss's signature for the media buying team, and I'll be done.

177
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,660
Okay. I'm going home then.

178
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,963
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

179
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,860
Boss?

180
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,600
May I come in?

181
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,290

196
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,000
She's so fake.

197
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,140
Hello.

198
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,440
Hi.

199
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,820
What are you girls talking about?

200
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,240
Oh, we are talking about a bad girl in this drama who loves to snare rich men.

201
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,680
That's right.

202
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,780
Oh, I don't watch dramas.

203
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:07,520
She just joined, and she's so fast.

204
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,860
Look at how close she is with Boss. I'm sure she's seducing him.

205
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,050
Nong Nim, let's go to your desk.

206
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,520
Wait. What are they talking about?

207
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,920
Don't pay them any attention. They gossip all day long.

208
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,540
It's all nonsense. Let's go to your desk.

209
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,600
I probably won't have the chance to sit in front of the boss's office during this lifetime.

210
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,780
Why is that?

211
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,980
Because all I do is work each day.

212
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:52,240
I don't know how to be fake. Unlike young people these days who use their bodies to climb the ladder.

213
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,100
Do you want to know who I'm talking about?

214
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,220
I'll tell you later so you won't be fooled.

215
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,020
Nong Nim, calm down. Don't listen to her.

216
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,240
Please tell us frankly who you're talking about.

217
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,340
I can give you a hint if you want to know.

218
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,540
Go ahead and read the group chat.

219
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,520
Did you take these photos?

220
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,620
No, I didn't.

221
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,920
Other people have shared them around.

222
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,520
Congratulations on becoming famous.

223
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,680
Don't bother with them. Let's focus on work.

224
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,480
Noom Nim, come and sit here.

225
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,240
What are you staring at?

226
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,750
Everyone, Boss and I don't have a relationship.

227
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,980
I was trying to get a document and it slipped.

228
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,360
I understand if it caused a misunderstanding.

229
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,560
The photos look misleading.

230
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:43,160
Your relationship is none of anyone's business.

231
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,860
Exactly.

232
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,520
Don't worry, Nong Nim.

233
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,360
We will find out who took those photos and tell Boss.

234
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,960
Let him take care of it.

235
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,060
Yes, he can confirm the truth.

236
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,020
No, don't tell him.

237
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020
Why not?

238
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,940
It's easiest to let him take care of it.

239
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,600
If he says it's not true, the rumor will stop, okay?

240
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,680
I don't want to do that.

241
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,800
Please don't tell him.

242
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,320
I don't want him to think I'm problematic.

243
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,280
Please? Let's just leave it be.

244
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,760
Things on social media come and go. This should quiet down very quickly.

245
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:35,040
As you wish, but I'm telling you it won't quiet down like you think.

246
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,540
Let's eat.

247
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,200
I have some documents for you to sign.

248
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,980
Thank you.

249
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,060
For the matcha biscuit project with Khun Mark,

250
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,560
our coordinators have asked Khun Baifern to come in for the fitting.

251
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,520
I told the brands that you mainly want pink tones for the outfits.

252
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,420
I'll let you know when there are more updates.

253
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,960
Noom Nim-san.

254
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,740
Is there anything bothering you recently?

255
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,080
There isn't. The work is quite smooth.

256
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,360
Are you sure?

257
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,080
Why do you ask?

258
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,280
I feel like you don't want to see me.

259
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,840
We see each other every day. Why would I not want to see you?

260
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,880
You realize that since we work together,

261
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,220
if you have any problem, you should tell me.

262
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,800
- But I don't have any problem.
- I don't believe you.

263
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,060
If you don't believe me, I don't know what else to do.

264
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,640
I'm better at reading people than you think.

265
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:33,720
I can tell that something is bothering you these days.

266
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,570
I don't want and I don't like

267
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,960
when someone seems uncomfortable while working with me.

268
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,940
If you don't tell me your problem, I can't help you fix it.

269
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,000
But I don't want your help!

270
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,380
What did you say?

271
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,320
I admit you're talented.

272
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,670
You see right through me,

273
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,300
but I have my reasons for not telling you what's wrong.

274
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,620
If you don't want me to feel uncomfortable,

275
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,080
I beg you, please don't ask.

276
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,900
I thought we trusted each other more than that.

277
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,780
But...

278
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,620
if we don't have anything to say to one another, you may leave.

279
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,740
I won't trouble you anymore.

280
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,790
<i>‎[Receive your item here]</i>

281
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,640
Don't, someone could see us!

282
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,060
Who would see us?

283
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,063
You sighed loudly. What's so exciting?

284
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
I didn't see it.

285
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,680
Sorry? What did you not see?

286
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,600
It's nothing.

287
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,343
You just said you didn't see it. What did you not see?

288
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,940
Khun Mark, hello.

289
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,380
What brings you here? It's not the day for our team meeting yet.

290
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,180
I came to follow up with one of your AEs.
<i>(T/N: Account Executive)</i>

291
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,740
I'll come here often from now on because something fun just happened.

292
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,460
What is it?

293
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,160
You arrived in time, Khun In. Please introduce your colleague to me.

294
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,620
I met her in the last meeting, and she gave me some good ideas.

295
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,500
It will be great to know who she is, right?

296
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,156
Of course.

297
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:44,500
This is Nong Noom Nim. She's Akitsuki-san's secretary.

298
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,240
Akitsuki-san has a secretary?

299
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,500
Yes, that's right.

300
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,460
That's very interesting.

301
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,480
It's a pleasure to meet you, Khun Noom Nim.

302
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,840
I hope we will see each other again.

303
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,940
Hello.

304
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,860
It's nice to meet you,

305
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,600
but I must excuse myself. I have a meeting.

306
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,110
Nong Nim, I want to talk to you about something.

307
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,540
Khun Mark, I'll be right back.

308
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,920
Nong Noom Nim!

309
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,720
Wait for me!

310
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,160
The outfits will be colorful and cute,

311
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,080
like blue and pink.

312
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,120
It's great. I like them.

313
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,060
I don't think this will work.

314
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,060
These outfits... They don't really fit the concept.

315
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,100
The pink is too sweet and a little outdated.

316
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,640
I need something that's more unisex.

317
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,780
Let's try with some yellow.

318
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,700
Oh, but—

319
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:09,500
I think the options are too limited.

320
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,760
Khun Mark may have a difficult time to choose.

321
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,360
Out of these outfits,

322
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,600
which one do you like the most, Khun Noom Nim?

323
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,920
Noom Nim-san is just a secretary.

324
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,203
I think you should ask the other teams.

325
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:35,330
Why?

326
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,390
Wasn't she the one who came up with the ideas,

327
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,200
like the beach, Japanese, and lively?

328
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,220
I'm just asking for her opinion.

329
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,963
I'm talking about being professional.

330
00:31:48,963 --> 00:31:52,283
And you are being unprofessional right now.

331
00:31:52,283 --> 00:31:55,840
I listen to everyone's opinion.

332
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,060
And what's wrong with me liking pink?

333
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,320
I'm just talking about the target audience, what they might prefer.

334
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,230
Is the one paying your company

335
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,960
the majority of the target audience or me?

336
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,740
Enlighten me.

337
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,740
In that case,

338
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,020
I don't have anything else to argue.

339
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,710
Good...

340
00:32:25,975 --> 00:32:28,193
because I'm your client.

341
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,580
Please remember that...

342
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,645
in case you've forgotten.

343
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,460
Normally,

344
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:46,670
I don't like rejecting my clients' requests if not necessary.

345
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,620
Wonderful.

346
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,420
Now, that's worthy of the praise that people give you.

347
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,600
And since you said you're not going to disagree with your clients' wishes,

348
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,960
I have one more thing to ask.

349
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:08,100
I'm not sure if you can really fulfill the request from your client or not.

350
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,680
Of course, I can.

351
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,520
Good.

352
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,900
I want Khun Noom Nim to be the AE for my project.

353
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,150
This matter involves her position in the company.

354
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,330
I'll have to think about it first.

355
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,051
I can't make a decision right now.

356
00:33:47,237 --> 00:33:53,310
You can't make a decision and give me an answer now. I understand.

357
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,140
Khun Noom Nim,

358
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,420
I want you to think about it.

359
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,860
If you're interested,

360
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,200
I will talk to your boss again.

361
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,000
Okay?

362
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,310
Khun Mark is wicked.

363
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,180
He wants Noom Nim to be his AE.

364
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,720
Will I be able to do it, P'In?

365
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:32,740
I don't know if you can, but I have a feeling that if you decline,

366
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,780
he will ask for other changes to the project.

367
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:42,120
He might call it off and shock our whole office.

368
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,230
About being Khun Mark's AE,

369
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:17,460
if you don't want to, you can tell me.

370
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,220
It's okay. I will be his AE.

371
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,500
But you have your responsibilities.

372
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,760
Your job is to be my secretary.

373
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,611
But Khun Mark has requested it.

374
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:33,071
If I don't do it, I'm afraid our project will suffer consequences.

375
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:37,900
You're saying this because you want to work with him, right?

376
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,680
No. I'm doing this for our company.

377
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,880
Don't give me an excuse.

378
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,980
You're doing this for yourself.

379
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,540
Why would you say that?

380
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,960
If you want to quit, you can.

381
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,500
Don't worry about finding me a new secretary

382
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,620
because everyone wants to be my secretary.

383
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,600
Oh.

384
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,000
You're right.

385
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,380
I'm doing this for myself.

386
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,180
What matters do you have with Boss?

387
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,020
Please reserve a conference room for 2 p.m.

388
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,660
But there are no meetings today.

389
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,680
Boss has an urgent meeting with the marketing team.

390
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:06,100
I will be his interpreter. Don't forget to reserve a room.

391
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,220
Let me take care of this for you.

392
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,000
You're someone who's never been into drinking before.

393
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,040
You only started working recently, and now you're downing the glass.

394
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,420
And Pinn is too busy to stop you.

395
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,360
That P'Ploy is so evil.

396
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:47,080
I bet she keeps instigating because she wants to replace you as the secretary.

397
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,860
Gosh!

398
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,980
Nim, you should tell your boss about the rumor in case he can help you.

399
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,640
Help by firing me sooner is what it will be.

400
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,560
You know what he said to me?

401
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,320
He said this,

402
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,080
"If you want to quit, you can."

403
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,300
"Don't worry about finding me a new secretary"

404
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,300
"because everyone wants to be my secretary."

405
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,120
Wow! I'm angry!

406
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,260
- At her boss?
- At you!

407
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,300
Why are you stealing my vegetables?

408
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,040
So what are you going to do?

409
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,420
Well, I feel uncomfortable. I want to quit.

410
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:31,880
<i>What?</i>

411
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,220
Hold on, you've only been working there for a month, and you're quitting already?

412
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,520
I can't be an AE.

413
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,720
I don't get along with my boss as a secretary.

414
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,000
Besides, P'Ploy is acting like she's becoming his new secretary.

415
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,980
Gosh! Your life is so miserable.

416
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,780
- Are you feeling bad for your friend?
- I'm just playing along.

417
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,480
Poppy!

418
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,600
Look, you should calm down.

419
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:02,000
I think you should talk to your boss again to work things out.

420
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,620
I'm afraid if I see him, I won't be able to quit.

421
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,440
How about this? Just forget it. Be confident.

422
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,000
Ignore everyone else. Focus on doing your best at work.

423
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,560
<i>Right.</i>

424
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,440
Okay. I'll fight!

425
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,520
- I must fight!
- Fight!

426
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,740
- I'm not quitting!
- Right. Don't quit.

427
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,080
- I'm not quitting anymore.
- Yes, you can do it!

428
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,290
- One more drink, please.
