<i>The new interpreter is Noom Nim. Today is her first day.</i>

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,840
<i>Do you know who my boss is?</i>

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,933
<i>Do you guys think it's possible not to remember someone you kissed?</i>

4
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:14,186
<i>On Monday. You will sit in front of my room instead.</i>

5
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:17,446
<i>- What did you just refer to yourself as?
- Nhu.</i>

6
00:00:17,446 --> 00:00:20,060
<i>I like it. It's cute.</i>

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,093
<i>I'm going to Chiang Mai for work, and you're going with me.</i>

8
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:24,693
<i>What?</i>

00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,740
‎<i>[Boss, Please Don't Flirt | Oh My Boss]</i>

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,250
‎♫ <i>Do you think you're the only one who feels this way</i> ♫

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,270
‎♫ <i>What you feel in your heart</i> ♫

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:56,600
‎♫ <i>Do you think that I don't feel the same</i> ♫

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,230
‎♫ <i>Is it okay to only think like that</i> ♫

14
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,340
‎♫ <i>Why are you keeping it to yourself</i> ♫

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:12,390

‎♫ <i>I can't see clearly if you love me or if you're just lonely</i> ♫

17
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,680
<i>My boss is going away for several days. Are there any plans for tonight?</i>

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,580
<i>Count me in!</i>

19
00:01:44,126 --> 00:01:45,341
Here you go.

20
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:47,641
Get in first.

21
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:51,660
Pardon? Do you want me to send you to the airport?

22
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,233
"Send"? You have to come along with me.

23
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,333
What?

24
00:01:56,333 --> 00:02:00,033
I'm going to Chiang Mai for work, and you're going with me.

25
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:04,640
But you didn't tell me I had to go.

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,520
I changed my mind.

27
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,726
I thought about it and realized, I'm going there for work, not for vacation

28
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:23,713
so if I go without my secretary, why do I even have one?

29
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,913
Get in. We'll find you a ticket at the airport. I don't want to miss my flight.

30
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,000
Come on. Hurry.

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,380
Start driving.

32
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,460
What about my clothes? I only have one outfit.

33
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,660
You can wear mine.

34
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,120
Or I can take you shopping for new clothes.

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,386
<i>All rooms are fully booked?</i>

36
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:52,346
Yes, they are. There's only one room available for now. We're sorry.

37
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,670
It's all right.

38
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,593
Boss, all rooms are fully booked. There's only one left.

39
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:13,033
Let's find a new hotel nearby.

40
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:18,613
We are meeting our client in a few hours. How can we find it on time? Think about it.

41
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,280
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:32,946
<i>Guys, what should I do?</i>

43
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:36,886
<i>It seems like I have to sleep in the same room with my boss tonight.</i>

44
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,293
<i>Hey! Are you already at that stage? You're a real fox, aren't you?</i>

45
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:47,346
<i>It's not like what you guys are thinking.</i>

46
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:52,486
<i>We're here for work, but the rooms are fully booked. There's only one left.</i>

47
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:54,886
<i>That's perfect then.</i>

48
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:56,646
<i>You should do what we're thinking then.</i>

49
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:59,260
<i>Hurry! This is the most perfect chance.</i>

50
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,000
<i>What do you mean?</i>

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,400
<i>Make him yours tonight.</i>

52
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,393
<i>Are you crazy? No. Why would I do that?</i>

53
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:12,293
<i>To get yourself your first guy ever. Drink a bit so you won't feel scared.</i>

54
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,713
<i>I don't drink!</i>

55
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:33,780
Since you have only one room left, then we have to go with that one.

56
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,100
Sure. Just a moment, please.

57
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:44,433
Please leave it here. I'll handle it.

58
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:45,814
Thank you.

59
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:48,611
We are scheduled to meet the client at 2 p.m., right?

60
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,070
Yes.

61
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,480
Then wake me up at 1 p.m.

62
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,201
Sure. I will wake you up on time.

63
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,966
Boss, what would you like to have for dinner this evening?

64
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:05,546
Since we're here, would you like to have local dishes,

65
00:06:05,546 --> 00:06:10,630
such as spicy northern Thai pork and tomato and northern Thai green chili dip?

66
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,300
Would you like that?

67
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,860
He fell asleep so fast.

68
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,420
Noom Nim-san, wake up. Wake up now!

69
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,500
Yes?

70
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,411
I asked you to wake me up, but you fell asleep yourself.

71
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:12,133
I'm sorry!

72
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:16,921
Stop saying sorry already. We only have 15 minutes before meeting the client.

73
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,360
Hurry!

74
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,140
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you bring so much stuff?

75
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,081
- These are all important.
- Where is the car?

76
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,600
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Car for rent, right?

77
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,086
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Where is the car that I've booked?

78
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:47,793
<i>I already gave it to someone else. I've been waiting for an hour.</i>

79
00:07:47,793 --> 00:07:51,013
- Do you have another one?
- <i>No. They're all fully booked.</i>

80
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,873
<i>I'm sorry. I do apologize.</i>

81
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,373
What is it?

82
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,282
He already gave the car to someone else, but I will try to contact another company.

83
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,136
Please place them here.

84
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,066
Excuse me, can I borrow your motorbike please?

85
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,240
I'm sorry?

86
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,100
I'm really in a hurry.

87
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,853
- Thank you.
- I'm staying at this hotel. Please don't be afraid that I will run away.

88
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:33,314
All right.

89
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:35,154
Thank you very much.

90
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,073
Do you have any car available?

91
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,490
Get on.

92
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,526
- What?
- Hurry.

93
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:50,026
Okay!

94
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,313
Just a moment, please.

95
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,010
Are you ready?

96
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,567
We are only five minutes late. I think it's all right.

97
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:11,027
Don't you know how important punctuality is to Japanese people?

98
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,153
Hello.

99
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,653
Do you know what time our appointment is scheduled?

100
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,570
I do sincerely apologize.

101
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,113
I take things seriously.

102
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:37,470
What I expect from you are steadiness and determination,

103
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,100
but you are late like this. How can I trust you?

104
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,166
I sincerely apologize.

105
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,566
It's all my fault.

106
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,660
Anyway, since you're already here,

107
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,240
I'll take you to see the location where I've planned to build a resort.

108
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,580
‎Oops!

109
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,030
‎Let's go!

110
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,993
Boss, I'm sorry.

111
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:21,800
- If there's a chance, I'll tell them it's my fault.
- You don't have to.

112
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,895
I must take responsibility for the mistake that had occurred.

113
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,227
I'm sorry. I was in a hurry so I wasn't careful.

114
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,700
Now, you're really like a mouse.

115
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,780
When being surrounded by the heat, you can't stay still.

116
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,293
I'll call you Nezumi from now on. It's easier than calling you Noom Nim.

117
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:34,793
Follow me now, and walk carefully, Nezumi.

118
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,300
Can you see the area over there? We are considering

119
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,510
the construction of ten village style buildings.

120
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,433
It's very beautiful here.

121
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:28,980
It's really suitable for building a resort.

122
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,766
It's my pleasure taking a look around here.

123
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:38,113
I do hope that we'll have an opportunity to create a promotional video for you.

124
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:49,458
It's our honor, too, for welcoming Akitsuki-san.

125
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:54,746
As for the contract, we will contact you later.

126
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,793
Certainly.

127
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,793
Please consider our proposal.

128
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:10,503
Anyway, I would like to invite you to drink with me this evening.

129
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,040
Let's see...

130
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,651
I'm not sure whether I have any urgent appointments.

131
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:28,300
Please come and drink with my boss.

132
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,754
Since this beautiful lady really wants me, I have to go then.

133
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:53,273
Noom Nim-san, please go back to the hotel first.

134
00:13:53,273 --> 00:13:56,460
I think I will get back late tonight.

135
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,453
Hold on! Isn't your secretary joining us?

136
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:02,840
That's not right. She invited me.

137
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,906
If there are only men, it's not fun at all!

138
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:09,260
Yes. I will go.

139
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,520
Great. It's settled then. Let's go.

140
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,497
<i>[Are You Ready - Yes!]</i>

141
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,146
I'm very delighted to have an opportunity to drink with you. Regarding our contract...

142
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:37,360
Saito-kun, have you ordered the food?

143
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,600
I'm starving now.

144
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,340
Akitsuki-san,

145
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,840
should we discuss the work after the meal?

146
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:50,090
Negotiating while feeling hungry usually doesn't yield a positive outcome.

147
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,720
You are right.

148
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,030
Let's talk about it after we finish our meal.

149
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,433
Please excuse me.

150
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,740
<i>[Welcome]</i>

151
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:51,390
<i>[Are you ready - Yes!]</i>

152
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:56,053
I know that you can do it. Just get it done quickly.

153
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,240
I'll manage that as soon as possible for you.

154
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,087
You should stop this habit of kidding around, or else you will miss this deal for real.

155
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,860
I've never failed, and I never will.

156
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,480
So you bring that girl with you?

157
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:40,346
I'm terribly sorry for being late today.

158
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:43,813
It's all my fault.

159
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:48,660
Normally, our boss is always very punctual.

160
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,320
He's really good at his work, and he's extremely strict.

161
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,933
He always looks after his employees and is an excellent boss.

162
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,620
If you sign this contract with us,

163
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,430
you definitely won't be disappointed.

164
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,926
I've never done anything without a plan.

167
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,390
That's why I brought her along. It's work, okay?

168
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,600
It's not like what you are thinking.

169

I've already talked to the president about the contract that we've agreed on earlier.

He's pleased to consider it again.

Nezumi-san, what are you doing?

210
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:24,246
I will take a shower. I must take a shower.

211
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:27,680
Why are you taking off your clothes here? Do it in the bathroom.

212
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,840
I'm taking a shower so I have to take it off now.

213
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,886
Why can't I do it here? Will you bite me or what?

214
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:36,521
I probably will if you don't stop this.

215
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:39,755
- Stop it.
- No...
- Stop!

216
00:21:39,755 --> 00:21:42,140
Why?

217
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,373
- I won't stop!
- Stop!

218
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,040
Do you know how tired I have been today because of you?

219
00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:20,040
Boss,

220
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,393
you are the kindest boss for me.

221
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,800
I feel cold. Can I hug you?

222
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,420
Are you awake now, Nezumi-san?

223
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:57,873
What?

224
00:25:00,414 --> 00:25:03,741
Do you remember what happened last night?

225
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,713
Did I do anything unpleasant?

226
00:25:11,713 --> 00:25:13,760
You did a lot.

227
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,089
You were extremely drunk.

228
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,940
You can scold me as much as you want.

229
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,613
I promise that I won't get wasted like this again.

230
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,610
Really?

231
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,853
Are you sure?

232
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:39,866
Do you think you can really do that?

233
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:41,573
Boss!

234
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,860
Don't pressure me.

235
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,560
Read this.

236
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,020
Hey, Mr. Kirei has agreed to sign the contract with us.

237
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,890
How did you do that, Boss?

238
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,131
I didn't. You did it.

239
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,702
Won't you hug me?

240
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:35,840
It would be best if you got dressed first.

241
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Why?

242
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,306
Have you never seen a man in a bath robe?

243
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,480
You should get ready, too.

244
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,763
I will take you sightseeing.

245
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,913
Are you going to buy clothes?

246
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,934
I will buy them for you so you won't have to wear the same outfit.

247
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,834
It's all right. I will buy them myself.

248
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,840
Go ahead and choose then.

249
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,513
Welcome.

250
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:08,573
Very lovely.

251
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:12,301
Thank you. I've never worn something like this before.

252
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,406
How much is this outfit?

253
00:28:15,406 --> 00:28:17,540
It's 350 THB.

254
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:23,453
Hold on. Are you letting me wear them alone? Why don't you wear them, too?

255
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,747
Do I look handsome?

256
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:38,247
Perfect! It's really suitable for visiting the temple.

257
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:49,073
Is it beautiful?

258
00:28:49,073 --> 00:28:50,660
It is.

259
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:01,633
Usually, people will pray here and then go inside. Let's go inside first.

260
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,993
What are you doing?

261
00:29:15,993 --> 00:29:19,833
You look adorable in this outfit, Noom Nim, so I'm taking a photo.

262
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,440
Here you are.

263
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:33,513
Sweetheart, look at them. They are wearing couple outfits.

264
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:35,193
That's so adorable. Don't you think?

265
00:29:35,193 --> 00:29:36,966
Don't tease them.

266
00:29:36,966 --> 00:29:38,841
They look so lovely though.

267
00:29:38,841 --> 00:29:41,101
Let's make a wish.

268
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,580
For this, you stick them in here. I'll show you.

269
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,000

270
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,026

271
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:15,213
Here is yours.

272
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:18,006
Let's pray.

273
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,326
Let's try these. They're still hot.

274
00:31:14,326 --> 00:31:18,553
They're Thai Yakitori.

275
00:31:18,553 --> 00:31:20,880
We call them Moo-Ping. (Grilled Pork)

276
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,440
How do you like it?

277
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,826
Are you trying to prank me, Nezumi-san?

278
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:42,106
What do you mean?

279
00:31:42,106 --> 00:31:43,673
It's so spicy.

280
00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:45,630
Is it?

281
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,254
I will order the drink for you. Please wait a moment.

282
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,946
Iced tea, please.

283
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,300
I will be back.

284
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,750
All right.

285
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,940

286
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,500
<i>Did you do the deed with the boss yet?</i>

287
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,340
<i>The deed? Are you crazy?</i>

288
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,320
<i>My heart almost stopped beating, just seeing him taking off his clothes!</i>

289
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,640
<i>Taking off his clothes? I'm feeling hungry now.</i>

290
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,680
<i>You kept saying no, but why did you even see him naked like that?</i>

291
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,493
<i>- I was drunk!
- In short, you got drunk and made love with your boss, right?</i>

292
00:32:46,493 --> 00:32:49,093
<i>Was he hot in bed? Did you feel overwhelmed?</i>

293
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,841
<i>It's not like that. I was drunk and then fell asleep.</i>

294
00:32:51,841 --> 00:32:55,654
<i>Then I woke up and just saw him walking out of the bathroom.</i>

295
00:32:55,654 --> 00:32:59,280
<i>You were drunk and fell asleep? That's it?</i>

296
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,120
<i>Nothing else?</i>

297
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,110
<i>I don't know. I couldn't remember anything.</i>

298
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,594

299
00:33:19,773 --> 00:33:21,473

300
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,300
- Here.
- Thank you.

301
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,660
I feel better.

302
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,386
What's wrong?

303
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,230
I'm tired.

304
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,700
Is it because you came out with me?

305
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,590
Oh, no.

306
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,230
It's about work.

307
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,173
Should we get back and rest?

308
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,013
I still don't want to go back.

309
00:33:58,013 --> 00:34:01,093
I know a place that can rid me of tiredness.

310
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,413
Where is it?

311
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,780
- Hello.
- Hello.

312
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,833
What options do you provide here?

313
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:24,193
Ours is a mixed onsen, but you can have your towel on.

314
00:34:24,193 --> 00:34:27,486
Sir and Madam, if you are interested, please kindly inform us.

315
00:34:27,486 --> 00:34:28,630
Yes. We will go with that.

316
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,980
Of course, Sir.

317
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,948
Will you get in, Nezumi?

318
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,880
- Nezumi-san?
- No, I won't.

319
00:34:58,072 --> 00:35:02,653
I'm not forcing you, but it can help you relax well.

320
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:08,240
It's all right for me. I prefer not to.

321
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:13,640
Then you can have some light meals at the café.

322
00:35:14,873 --> 00:35:16,873
All right.

323
00:35:20,206 --> 00:35:22,420
Thank you.

324
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,320
<i>‎[You received a call from Hazobe]</i>

325
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,626
<i>[Please call me back very soon. It's urgent!]</i>

326
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,741
If you would like to get in, you must change into a towel robe first.

327
00:36:17,726 --> 00:36:22,300
But I'm not here to use the onsen. I just want to go inside.

328
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,500
You must get changed.

329
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:28,626
Boss!

330
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,281
Why did you scream? I have my towel on.

331
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,833
Didn't you say you wouldn't use the onsen?

332
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:38,006
Why are you here?

333
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,890
Did you change your mind?

334
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,526
No.

335
00:37:43,526 --> 00:37:47,680
Hazobe-san called, but I missed it.

336
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,360
He asked you to call back immediately, so I figured it's an important matter.

337
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,901
So I'm bringing your phone here.

338
00:37:53,901 --> 00:37:55,601
Wait!

339
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,293
Hazobe called to tell me that he would pick us up at the airport.

340
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,340
He asked about the time. That's it.

341
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,246
I see. Okay.

342
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,320
Please drink sake with me.

343
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,833
<i>I feel cold. Can I hug you?</i>

344
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:05,900
No, I won't. Getting drunk yesterday was already bad enough.

345
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,546
But I liked it.

346
00:39:18,013 --> 00:39:20,870
You've put me in trouble several times already

347
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,640
so you can't refuse me.

348
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:30,206
Boss, but I'm really afraid I will get drunk.

349
00:39:30,206 --> 00:39:33,541
You are with me. Why are you afraid?

350
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:42,180
That's because when I get drunk, I can't remember what I do.

351
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,500
You can't remember anything when you're drunk?

352
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:50,200
Does that mean you were very drunk that night?

353
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,146
Which night?

354
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:08,140
Call me.

355
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,810
<i>Call me.</i>

356
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,820
‎Well...

357
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,601
I was going to send you a message, but I lost your name card.

358
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,470
Really?

359
00:40:36,993 --> 00:40:39,573
What kind of message were you going to send me then?

360
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,740
Well,

361
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:49,800
it's just telling you to drive home safely.

362
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,620
Something like that.

363
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:57,493
Who would send that kind of message to the person they just kissed?

364
00:41:11,906 --> 00:41:14,800
I won't ask you anymore then.

365
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,726
What did you wish for at the temple?

366
00:41:22,766 --> 00:41:26,710
I prayed for me to have a chance to visit Japan at least once.

367
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,280
So does that mean that you've never been there?

368
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,540
Never.

369
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,933
It's expensive. I can't afford it.

370
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:42,830
But actually, I studied Japanese

371
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,820
because I've always wanted to go there.

372
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:51,226
I want to see Mount Fuji and sakura trees.

373
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:54,820
I want to play in the snow.

374
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,166
I can take you there.

375
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,160
I don't want to.

376
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,566
If I go with my Boss, he will make me work hard.

377
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,560
We can go together as another status that isn't a boss and a secretary.

378
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,666
With what status would you like to go with me?

379
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,010
As a friend?

380
00:42:22,313 --> 00:42:24,260
Or?

381
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,390
I'll get it filled.

382
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,950
<i>Why is my heart beating this fast?</i>

383
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:46,253
<i>Or am I having a secret crush on my boss?</i>

384
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:47,753
<i>That's crazy!</i>

385
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,920
<i>Young people these days use their bodies to climb the ladder.</i>

386
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,480
<i>She acts innocent and quiet, but she goes after them all.</i>

387
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,393
<i>Who is Khun Mark?</i>

388
00:43:00,393 --> 00:43:04,140
<i>He's a major client and a huge womanizer.</i>

389
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,253
<i>You sighed loudly. What's so exciting?</i>

390
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:09,286
<i>I want Khun Noom Nim to be the AE for my project.</i>

391
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:12,080
<i>I thought we trusted each other more than that.</i>

392
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,000

393
