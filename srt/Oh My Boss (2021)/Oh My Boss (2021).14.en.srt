Mr. Koji!

9
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:02,658
Oops, that's our employee.

10
00:01:02,658 --> 00:01:05,908
She saw us. What should we do then?

11
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:09,768
We were caught by an employee while we're doing "something".

12
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:14,208
Because you think that if I find out about your past, I can't take it, right?

13
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:18,758
I can accept everything, except for what you just did!

14
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:22,058
I can't stand seeing you two kiss like that!

15
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:24,038
I'm not as perfect as what you thought.

16
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:28,534
I already told you that I never care about

17
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:32,630
who you used to be or what you used to do.

18
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,438
The person I love is this Koji.

Ms. Noom Nim.

24
00:01:58,838 --> 00:02:00,288
Oh.

25
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:14,288
The client said our previous project was amazing

26
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:17,738
and we're likely to get a new one soon.

Ms. Noom Nim.

29
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:36,878
If we can get through it, we may get four times the bonus.

30
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:44,358
Four times the bonus!

31
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,848
I'm so happy.

32
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:51,728
That's great.

33
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:54,098
Sorry I'm late.

34
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:58,558
I was welcoming the board members from our Japan headquarters.

35
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:01,918
Sorry. If we'd known they were coming, we'd have given them a better welcome.

36
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:03,842
It's alright.

37
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:06,188
The reason of their visit

38
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:10,188
is to announce the new regulations from the Japan headquarters.

39
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:16,308
Until now, they've allowed flexibility at ViperX Thailand to align with the target country.

40
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:19,298
But from now on,

41
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:24,518
the exact same regulations as the Japan headquarters' will apply.

42
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:28,228
We're going to replace the whole management team.

43
00:03:28,978 --> 00:03:34,688
More people from Japan will be transferred here to take on management roles.

44
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:43,148
Excuse me, is this going to affect the current employees?

45
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:49,338
To systemize our business, half of the staff will be laid off.

46
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,868
How could you do this?

47
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:04,547
Laying off half of the employees?

48
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:07,611
Who would want to continue working for you?

49
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:12,918
You know who I am.

50
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,668
What you're doing is not increasing the parent company's profits.

51
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:24,968
We'll have to pay millions of severance pay.

52
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:28,981
I know, but it's as they say,

53
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:31,298
you can't solve a problem without making some sacrifice.

54
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:34,706
What's not important needs to be cut out.

55
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:40,256
If you're not happy with it, then get ready to go back to being a bar host.

56
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:45,278
Please.

57
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:47,988
Please don't be me.

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,768
I have to pay for my mortgage, my car, and my mom's living expenses.

59
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:56,218
How will I live?

60
00:04:57,495 --> 00:05:00,798
Finding a job is difficult these days.

61
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:03,878
Plus, I'm already 30.

62
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:07,158
It's going to be hard for me to get a new job.

63
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:12,448
If I got laid off, I wouldn't know what to do either.

64
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:14,638
You'll be fine because you're still young.

65
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:17,808
You have a future, unlike me.

66
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:20,498
I'm old.

67
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:27,548
Guys, please calm down. Don't think too far ahead.

68
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:30,358
We must get it together.

69
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:39,108
I got laid off.

70
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:42,718
Hey, me too.

71
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:45,988
Me three.

72
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:49,798
What about you, Nim?

73
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:55,998
I haven't got anything yet.

74
00:05:55,998 --> 00:05:58,368
Why are you the only one who didn't get laid off?

75
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:02,288
It's not fair. I'm going to ask Boss how they made the decision.

76
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:06,148
Was it based on our performance or a lottery? It's disgusting.

77
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:10,598
Don't you all want to know why Noom Nim wasn't let go?

78
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:15,420
Don't bother, Ploy. I'll ask him myself.

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,123
You have no manners. Why didn't you knock first?

80
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,218
I want to talk to Mr. Koji.

81
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:35,118
You can talk to me.

82
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:39,128
He and I are like the same person.

83
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:44,928
I guess you came to ask Koji to save everyone from getting laid off.

84
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:55,378
The person you should be begging for help from is me, not him.

85
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:57,408
I know.

86
00:06:57,408 --> 00:07:02,348
I'm the reason you did that to everyone else.

87
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:06,058
Yes, you're right. Smart girl.

88
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:11,978
If you want to save everyone from getting laid off, you will resign

89
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:16,558
and I may reconsider what to do with this branch.

90
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:47,038
Boss.

91
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:49,778
Ms. Nim, go wait outside.

92
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:52,478
- But...
- Please.

93
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:07,508
Nim, how did it go?

94
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:10,098
I don't know yet.

95
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:58,138
I'm really sorry for everything.

96
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:03,808
All this time,

97
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:06,780
I know you've been genuine with me.

98
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,278
It's my fault.

99
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:15,648
I wasn't genuine with you from the start,

100
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:17,578
Ms. Rena.

101
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:24,198
I don't want you to forgive me.

102
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:27,498
But I beg you,

103
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:34,818
please don't use the careers of other people who have nothing to do with this as leverage.

104
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,168
You know what I want.

105
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:50,417
If you'd changed your mind and agreed to be mine,

106
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:53,101
this would have been over by now.

107
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:03,338
Unfortunately, now I want more than that.

108
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:05,828
What do you want me to do?

109
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:16,728
Kneel down and beg me.

110
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,958
Here you are.

111
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,228
I need to talk to you.

112
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,168
Perfect timing.

113
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,408
I need to talk to you as well.

114
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:42,685
That you're the reason your colleagues got laid off?

115
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:46,348
Or you want some sex advice?

116
00:10:46,348 --> 00:10:49,236
I can tell you what Koji likes.

117
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:52,168
Don't use that to get rid of me.

118
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:54,858
It's not going to work.

119
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:59,558
Are you saying you don't care that he and I slept together,

120
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:04,078
or are you so innocent that you think I'm lying?

121
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,390
I don't think you're lying, seeing how serious you are about this.

122
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,875
Koji told me everything about you and him.

123
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,088
But it was in the past.

124
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:23,908
We all have pasts.

125
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:29,764
Are you gloating that even though I slept with him,

126
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:32,548
you're still the one for him?

127
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:34,738
I'm not.

128
00:11:34,738 --> 00:11:40,118
I'm just saying his past iswhat I have to accept and live with,

129
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:43,378
no matter how hard it is.

130
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,078
So please stop.

131
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:53,501
You don't know anything.

132
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:56,421
You don't know what I've done for him.

133
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,898
What have you done for him that I haven't? Tell me.

134
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:08,438
Thank you, Ms. Rena.

135
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:10,418
Thank you?

136
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:19,798
Thank you for helping Mr. Koji back then...

137
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:23,600
and made him become who he is today.

138
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:30,308
You may think I don't understand you,

139
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:33,048
but I do understand everything.

140
00:12:33,048 --> 00:12:36,520
I understand the feelings

141
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,360
of a woman who does everything for love with all her heart.

142
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,088
And I understand why you're so mean to me.

143
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:53,318
You probably don't want to hear me say this,

144
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:56,828
but I want to tell you.

145
00:12:56,828 --> 00:13:00,398
I will do my best to take care of him.

146
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:02,518
No matter what happens, I will never let go of his hand.

147
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:06,081
Stop! Just stop already!

148
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,031
You said you'd never let go of his hand? I'm the one who will never let go of his hand!

149
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:32,758
You'd better keep your word.

150
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,006
Nim,

151
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:45,968
do you have any update about Boss and Rena's discussion?

152
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,848
They've been in there since noon.

153
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,738
Perfect timing.

154
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:54,508
I need to talk to you as well.

155
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:57,518
I don't know anything.

156
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,778
Why are you screaming? What's going on?

157
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,618
We're not being laid off anymore.

158
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:15,308
Boss must have done something to help us.

159
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:21,118
I love you, Boss, for not abandoning insignificant employees like us.

160
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,118
Mom, I'm not being laid off anymore.

161
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:29,668
Hello.

162
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:33,178
I'm not selling my car anymore. I want it back.

163
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:37,738
It's good to be you. You don't have anything to worry about like the others do.

164
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:43,668
Sleeping your way to the top is easy, isn't it?

165
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:46,148
What does that mean?

166
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,164
Nothing. I mean you've worked your way to the top.

167
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,968
Is it done?

168
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:10,818
Okay, good.

169
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:21,868
Kneel down and beg me.

170
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:41,658
You know what? Kneeling down to apologize for something that's not your fault

171
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:45,798
is considered a dire matter for Japanese people.

172
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:52,908
If it will make you stop,

173
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,078
I will quit myself.

174
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:04,218
I beg you.

175
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:09,048
Please don't fire any of the staff.

176
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:15,188
They didn't do anything wrong.

177
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,278
It's my fault.

This is exactly why I like you.

190
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:41,598
What are you doing here alone?

191
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:53,028
You've given up?

192
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,988
I've come to my senses.

193
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:02,348
Now I know why Koji loves that girl.

194
00:20:03,478 --> 00:20:05,608
Come on.

195
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:10,848
You're not right for him.

196
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,555
[Keep at it!] [Don't give up.] [For every dark night, there's a brighter day.] [I'm rooting for you.]

197
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:39,515
[Believe in yourself.] [I want to see your face.] [I understand you.] [Keep going.] [You can do it!]

198
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:44,438
Nim.

199
00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:48,921
What's up?

200
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:52,231
An urgent order for you.

201
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:03,571
- Is this...
- Yes.

202
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:08,758
You are transferring back to being Boss' secretary, effective today.

203
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:10,228
Yay!

204
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:13,568
It was a direct order from Ms. Rena.

205
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:16,718
Good luck.

206
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,728
Thanks.

207
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:32,301
Congratulations, Noom Nim. You're finally getting back to doing what you do best.

208
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:38,788
I'm glad. Ms. Rena gave me a chance.

209
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:42,638
But I would do my best, no matter the role.

210
00:21:42,638 --> 00:21:44,848
Really?

211
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:48,301
I'm sure you'll do it better with Boss.

212
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:50,821
And you'll get to be with him all the time.

213
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:53,590
Ploy,

214
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,420
I don't think you should be

215
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:01,300
worrying about me or my performance.

216
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:06,618
Worry about your own work.

217
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:11,798
Because when I'm not working in this department anymore, who's going to

218
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:17,428
help correct your unreliable translation?

219
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:19,138
Hey!

220
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:22,858
Be careful.

221
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:28,468
If you keep incorrectly translate reports for clients,

222
00:22:28,468 --> 00:22:31,858
you'll get a bad annual performance review.

223
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:38,111
No offense, but I just don't want our work to suffer

224
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:42,301
because someone's careless at what they do.

225
00:22:47,108 --> 00:22:52,618
But thank you for everything...

226
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:57,280
and sorry I confused you

227
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,650
by transferring back and forth.

228
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:04,828
When we run into each other after this, you can still say hello to me.

229
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:06,828
Don't ignore me, okay?

230
00:23:15,108 --> 00:23:17,148
Hey!

231
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:20,178
Watch it!

232
00:23:20,178 --> 00:23:22,708
I'm sorry!

233
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,780
<i>­</i>

234
00:23:52,012 --> 00:23:55,728
Don't get me wrong. That was just a goodbye hug.

235
00:23:57,258 --> 00:24:00,238
Where are you going?

236
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,238
I'm going back to Japan.

237
00:24:02,238 --> 00:24:06,688
I found no issues from the audit.

238
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:12,578
Congratulations on getting your position back.

239
00:24:15,546 --> 00:24:17,476
Are you leaving right away?

240
00:24:17,476 --> 00:24:23,168
Yes. I don't have any business here anymore.

241
00:24:25,268 --> 00:24:27,698
I wish you lots of happiness.

242
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:47,953
Boss, what did you do to get things back to normal?

243
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,273
I won't tell you. It's a secret.

244
00:24:50,273 --> 00:24:54,183
Why? You have to tell me. Did you do something bad?

245
00:24:54,183 --> 00:24:59,256
Yes. I hugged and kissed her.

246
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,798
Did you believe that?

247
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:04,218
- No.
- Good.

248
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:07,578
Tell me. I want to know.

Someone's early because she's happy

260

she got her old position back.

261

I look forward to working with you.

Of course I'm happy. I can now cause my boss trouble again.

You won't. You're good at your job.

00:26:10,258 --> 00:26:15,588
By the way, did you bring me my meal box?

265
00:26:17,468 --> 00:26:18,738
I forgot.

266
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:23,041
How could you forget? I'm so hungry.

267
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,672
Just kidding. I brought it.

00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:54,448
<i>Now my mom calls him another son of hers.</i>

272
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:59,798
<i>But there's one thing I still worry about.</i>

273
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,550
- Bye.
- Bye.

274
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,738
Come to my room.

275
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,318
Oh my god!

276
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:38,608
That woman was so posh.

277
00:27:38,608 --> 00:27:42,508
I never thought I'd get to work with her.

278
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:47,488
They're all targeting our boss. He's so popular these days.

279
00:27:47,488 --> 00:27:52,578
Since Ms. Rena went back to Japan,women have been approaching him every day.

280
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:58,790
Of course, he's voted hottest,

281
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,410
single CEO of 2020.

282
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:06,598
Everyone is interested in our company.

283
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:11,838
Stop! Why are you guys talking here? Don't you have work to do?

284
00:28:11,838 --> 00:28:14,288
What? I just wanted to gossip with you.

285
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:18,313
You're his secretary. I want to know who he's flirting with.

286
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:22,071
I don't know. Don't ask me. I don't know anything!

287
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,688
She still has no idea we're rooting for her.

288
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:45,038
Ms. Nezumi.

289
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:46,898
Hey, Ms. Noom Nim.

290
00:28:46,898 --> 00:28:48,998
What's wrong?

291
00:28:48,998 --> 00:28:50,481
Nothing.

292
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:52,971
Something is wrong.

293
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:54,692
You're confused.

294
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:59,048
I'm not confused. I'm mad.

295
00:28:59,048 --> 00:29:02,678
Really? About what?

296
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:09,858
You only work with young woman clients these days.

297
00:29:09,858 --> 00:29:14,681
I don't know if it's because they think you're a single CEO.

298
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:16,388
Wait.

299
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:20,328
- Let go.
- No.

300
00:29:21,728 --> 00:29:22,961
Why are you smiling?

301
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:26,241
Because someone's jealous.

302
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:32,258
You said yourself you didn't want anyone to know we're together.

303
00:29:33,415 --> 00:29:36,998
Oh, so this is all my fault?

304
00:29:36,998 --> 00:29:39,901
- Yes.
- You're crazy.

305
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:41,721
- Wait.
- What now?

306
00:29:41,721 --> 00:29:43,938
What will you say...

307
00:29:43,938 --> 00:29:47,148
if I announce it to everyone right now?

308
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:55,028
Don't. I don't want you to lose your clients.

309
00:29:55,908 --> 00:29:58,718
I understand that it's work.

310
00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:01,370
Hey!

311
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,878
What?

312
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:04,478
Hey!

313
00:30:04,478 --> 00:30:07,019
- Stop!
- No.

314
00:30:15,728 --> 00:30:17,608
Let go!

315
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:25,628
"I understand that it's work."

316
00:30:25,628 --> 00:30:28,838
That's not true. You don't understand, Nim.

317
00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:31,398
You're possessive. You're jealous.

318
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:33,948
You want him to be yours only.

319
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:38,608
Hey, keep it down. Why did you have to raise your voice at her?

320
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:40,228
Right?

321
00:30:40,228 --> 00:30:42,318
Because you're annoying.

322
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:45,958
Stop playing hard to get.

323
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:49,378
If I'd been there, I'd have slapped you.

324
00:30:49,378 --> 00:30:51,798
You're the queen of sarcasm.

325
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:53,658
- I'm annoyed.
- I'm annoyed too.

326
00:30:53,658 --> 00:30:54,880
With her, right?

327
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,130
With you.

328
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:59,648
She's our friend. You should be on her side.

329
00:30:59,648 --> 00:31:01,240
Fine.

330
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:05,198
Nim, maybe you could do less of what you do now.

331
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:08,562
- Playing too hard to get won't get you anywhere these days.
- Exactly.

332
00:31:08,562 --> 00:31:13,518
If you don't mark your territory, other women won't stop flirting with your boss.

333
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:16,921
What do I do? Do I have to pee?

334
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:21,158
No, you don't pee. You seduce him. Seduce him.

335
00:31:21,158 --> 00:31:23,281
Play with his head.

336
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:28,398
Play with his head, so he knows you are not a little mouse.

337
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:31,678
You are not a little mouse he can put anywhere.

338
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:36,578
Yes, you're a tiger woman who chooses her own prey.

339
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:39,308
Paw!

340
00:32:19,858 --> 00:32:21,558
Mr. Koji.

341
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,218
I thought our meeting was on Monday.

342
00:32:26,218 --> 00:32:30,208
I'm flying tomorrow morning,
so I decided to come here first.

343
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:34,060
I'd like to make some changes to our next year's campaign,

344
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:38,378
but we can discuss that after you're done talking to these guys.

345
00:32:38,378 --> 00:32:39,978
Alright.

346
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,820
Seduce him.

347
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,340
Play with his head, so he knows you are not a little mouse.

348
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,438
Don't touch my girlfriend!

349
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:59,378
Did you guys trick me?

350
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:03,798
Can you help me piss Mr. Koji off?

351
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:09,437
Of course. That's what I do best.

352
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:13,588
Ms. Nim asked for my help.

353
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:19,858
I'll leave you to talk with your boss.

354
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,500
Koji, isn't this what needs to be done?

355
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,408
If you don't do it, things will keep going the same way.

356
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,618
You all heard it right.

357
00:34:52,618 --> 00:34:57,215
Ms. Noom Nim is my girlfriend.

358
00:35:08,578 --> 00:35:11,348
Will that do, Ms. Nezumi?

359
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:13,398
My girlfriend.

360
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,588
Kiss! Kiss!

361
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:33,328
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

362
00:35:33,328 --> 00:35:37,980
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

<i>of being a fairytale princess...</i>

369
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,620
<i>and hope to meet the prince of their dreams</i>

370
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,360
<i>who's handsome, perfect,</i>

371
00:36:04,368 --> 00:36:07,508
<i>and willing to take care of them for the rest of their lives.</i>

372
00:36:08,398 --> 00:36:10,521
<i>My boss is that prince for me.</i>

373
00:36:10,521 --> 00:36:16,581
<i>I used to think my dream seemed out of reach,</i>

374
00:36:16,581 --> 00:36:22,681
<i>but now it came true right in front of me.</i>

375
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,263
Why do you keep looking at my photos?

376
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:30,478
I'm right in front of you.

377
00:36:31,548 --> 00:36:34,118
I wanted to.

378
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:37,838
Do you need anything?

379
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,458
Book me a hotel in Japan.

380
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:44,660
Book a hotel? Why?

381
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,043
You don't have any work in Japan.

382
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:50,783
- Or is it in the schedule?
- I'm taking you there for vacation.

383
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,748
Vacation?

384
00:36:55,748 --> 00:37:01,868
As promised, I'm taking you to Japan.

385
00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:05,098
Are you serious?

386
00:37:06,218 --> 00:37:10,068
You're not taking me there for work, right?

391
00:37:29,058 --> 00:37:33,078
You're always flirting, Mr. Koji.

392
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:38,478
I'm flirting with you because I like you.

393
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,803
Then I hope you keep flirting with me for a long time.
