<i>Do you always allow men to easily touch you like this?</i>

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,540
<i>Khun Mark is our client.</i>

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,084
<i>Do you still remember your job description, that you're my secretary?</i>

4
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:09,306
<i>Can you not go?</i>

5
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:12,630
<i>Boss, I don't want to go back on my words with the client.</i>

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,100
<i>Anyway, it's nearly our reservation time. Let's go.</i>

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,550
<i>[Boss, Please Don't Flirt | Oh My Boss]</i>

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,590
‎♫ <i>Do you think you're the only one who feels this way</i> ♫

00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,460
‎♫ <i>What you feel in your heart</i> ♫

10

15
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:22,293
You're barely eating anything. Is the food not good?

16
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,510
It's not that. I'm just not hungry.

17
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:32,686
Most girls who say they aren't hungry are trying to keep in shape,

18
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:36,746
but you look fit already.

19
00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:40,403
I'm really not hungry.

20
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:47,800
It looks like your boss is not happy that you came with me.

21
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,609
Am I right?

22
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,010
I wonder why Akitsuki Koji

23
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,160
is so interested in you.

24
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:06,605
I'm just his employee, nothing more.

25
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:12,790
You and your boss are very interesting.

26
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,933
How so?

27
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,412
I've been watching you guys for a while.

28
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:28,621
At first, it was hard to figure out how you feel about Akitsuki-san,

29
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:30,530
but really,

30
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,920
we are the same.

31
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,760
The same?

32
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,150
You're dating him

33
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,850
for personal gain, right?

34
00:03:43,853 --> 00:03:47,753
That's not right. I do not think that way.

35
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:52,190
What are you trying to get at?

36
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,600
I told you I wouldn't tell anyone about you and that woman, so—

37
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,330
Khun Nim.

38
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,130
I have dated a lot of women.

39
00:04:04,138 --> 00:04:07,784
I can see right through you.

40
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,186
But I really don't think of my boss like that.

41
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:18,692
If it's not for personal gain, that means you honestly like him.

42
00:04:22,706 --> 00:04:25,286
Okay, I will stop teasing you.

43
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:29,727
I thought it would be easier to get close to you.

44
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:33,123
It turns out it's quite difficult.

45
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:36,523
No wonder Akitsuki-san is interested in you.

46
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:38,223
What?

47
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,330
As I said, Khun Nim,

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,330
I'm a businessman.

49
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,489
Most women throw themselves at me for money.

50
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,709
It's rare to find someone sincere.

51
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,083
What does that have to do with me?

52
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:01,553
Getting close to you is difficult, and that's what makes it interesting.

53
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:08,010
I was going to do this for fun,

54
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:13,280
but now I changed my mind.

55
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,390
I love a good challenge.

56
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,975
You still haven't left yet.

57
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,336
Are you going to stay here until morning?

58
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:57,210
No.

59
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,110
I will leave when my work is done.

60
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,310
But I think the amount of work

61
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,070
won't decrease anytime soon.

62
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,678
If it's too much, don't push yourself too hard.

63
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,713
I'm not.

64
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,480
If you're not,

65
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,830
you should go home.

66
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,123
What made you come back to the office?

67
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,800
Are you hoping someone will come back?

68
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:39,900
I'm leaving now.

69
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,807
I talked to Ms. Noom Nim today.

70
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:53,580
Why are you talking about her?

71
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:55,590
There's no reason.

72
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,510
I just thought that because she is your secretary,

73
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,600
you should know what's going on with her.

74
00:07:04,537 --> 00:07:06,578
I don't.

75
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:09,270
And please don't bring her up.

76
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,376
I don't want to know anything.

77
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:17,003
What happened? Did you really fight with Noom Nim-chan?

78
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,009
What happened?

79
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,538
I saw your photos in the company group chat the other day.

80
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:24,700
You two looked very close then.

81
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,169
- What photos?
- What? Haven't you seen them?

82
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,341
Is this why you are fighting?

83
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:01,373
<i>[Mark: Last night was so much fun.]</i>

84
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:04,573
<i>[Sure.]</i>

85
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,120
- Is it really her?
- Yes.

86
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,904
Nim-san, please come in as well.

87
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,749
Khun Ploy, your behavior is inappropriate.

88
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:16,051
What right do you have to take Nim-san's photo without permission?

89
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,950
Nong Noom Nim's behavior is untrustworthy. Ever since she started working here, she has caused problems.

90
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,993
You can see it yourself.

91
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,384
But I'm now working with Khun Mark. You should be pleased.

92
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:37,398
Of course, it's what you do best.

93
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry if I've violated someone's rights,

94
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,870
but I'm only worried about our company's image.

95
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,390
If this matter doesn't affect work, I won't do it again.

96
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,383
Please don't do it again.

97
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,880
You may leave now.

98
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:07,380
All right.

99
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:16,713
Nim-san, don't go yet.

100
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,983
You shouldn't get too familiar with the client.

101
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:31,620
Don't forget that this is work.

102
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,360
But I'm not familiar with him though. I didn't—

103
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,487
You should separate personal matters from work.

104
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,380
Otherwise, it will look improper.

105
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,404
The clients will view our company negatively too.

106
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:52,773
I understand.

107
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:57,843
I will be careful from now on. Please excuse me.

108
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,541
Nim-chan.

109
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,672
Are you okay? You don't look good.

110
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,367
It's nothing.

111
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,090
By the way you're acting, there's something for sure.

112
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,327
Did Akitsuki-san scold you?

113
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:43,869
It's nothing. Please don't pay any heed.

114
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:12,350
You sure look happy.

115
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,636
Hello.

116
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,812
Why do you sound indifferent?

117
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:27,260
You don't sound like that night when we talked.

118
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:35,012
If you're here to talk about work, I'll bring the presentation and show it to you.

119
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,710
Wait.

120
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,750
This company is weird.

121
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,060
The employees speak to the clients coldly,

122
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,333
unlike when they talk to their Japanese boss so sweetly.

123
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,318
If it's not convenient for you to discuss work today, I would like to be excused.

124
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,299
- Wait a moment, Khun Nim.
- Please let go.

125
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:03,915
I told you to let go of me. Please let go.

126
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:09,009
I paid you to work, not to play around.

127
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,424
But she's not playing around.

128
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:23,655
I had a question about the brand ambassador that ViperX proposed

129
00:13:23,655 --> 00:13:26,555
so I asked her to meet me.

130
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,520
If it's about work, you may use the conference room at the office.

131
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,220
Then I apologize.

132
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,310
It's just that your employee is a little too cute.

133
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,653
I couldn't help myself.

134
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:49,189
Well then, I'll be on my way.

135
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:51,366
I will contact you again.

136
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:44,998
Yes?

137
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,347
Were you unable to wait to see each other, so you snuck around to meet up?

138
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:55,269
Khun Mark greeted me first.

139
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,040
Besides, it's my job to talk to a client.

140
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,730
To discuss... work?

141
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,556
I guess you also had fun discussing work at dinner last night.

142
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:11,053
We had so much fun.

143
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,558
Would you like to hear what we discussed so you don't have to eavesdrop next time?

144
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:19,632
Are you being sarcastic?

145
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:24,498
No. I'm just afraid you'll misunderstand.

146
00:15:24,498 --> 00:15:28,860
Would it be great? I'll call you every time I talk to Khun Mark.

147
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,760
Stop.

148
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:36,590
I'm just warning you to be careful.

149
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,929
I can guess what kind of person Khun Mark is.

150
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:45,825
Thank you for the warning. That way I'll be careful.

151
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:11,489
Let's go for a drink.

152
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:14,480
Do you want to come along? It will be fun!

153
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,290
Boss.

154
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,840
Boss!

155
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,178
Hey, Boss! Are you listening?

156
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,872
Yes, I'm listening.

157
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:30,079
I'll finish the rest.

158
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,490
What?

159
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,470
I wasn't talking about work.

160
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,370
I was talking about a night out.

161
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,195
I noticed you've been working so hard these days.

162
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:47,394
You should take care of yourself, or you'll get sick.

163
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:49,010
Fine.

164
00:16:50,665 --> 00:16:57,035
By the way, I saw Noom Nim-chan cry today.

165
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,753
What did you do to her?

166
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,772
It looked like she had been worried for several days.

167
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:09,659
I didn't do anything. I just asked her to work as usual.

168
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:12,153
Hmmm...

169
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,380
A jealous guy is not cute!

170
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,973
Do you understand, Boss?

171
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,030
This is not a soap opera,

172
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,402
where people will feel captivated by seeing the male lead get jealous because of the female lead.

173
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:31,060
Jealous? Who are you talking about?

174
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:36,220
Oh... I don't know.

175
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,470
I just think

176
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,750
someone must be jealous because of Noom Nim-chan, so they're thinking too much.

177
00:17:42,754 --> 00:17:44,848
I'm not sure.

178
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,540
Have you ever asked Noom Nim-chan

179
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,460
how she feels?

180
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,189
Boss, try talking to Noom Nim-chan.

181
00:18:08,189 --> 00:18:12,643
She might be waiting for you to make up with her.

182
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:19,172
While you're putting on a pretense and pretending in front of each other, be careful—

183
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:21,496
Wow! Koji!

184
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:24,976
Hey! What's wrong?

185
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,990
He's got a fever.

186
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,527
This is not good.

187
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,364
Hey, Noom Nim.

188
00:18:56,364 --> 00:19:00,478
Why are you making that face? Are you feeling unwell?

189
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:04,420
I'm just tired from work.

190
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,407
Work again? Is the workload too much these days?

191
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:11,143
A little, but I can handle it.

192
00:19:11,143 --> 00:19:14,230
I'm glad to hear that, but if it becomes too much, you must get some rest.

193
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:18,480
It's not good to overexert yourself, or you'll get sick just like Boss.

194
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,184
That's true.

195
00:19:21,712 --> 00:19:23,430
Why are you making that face?

196
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,210
Don't you know that Boss is sick?

197
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,812
What's wrong with him?

198
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:29,415
Yesterday, he worked too hard and knocked himself out.

199
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:31,147
So he's not coming in today.

200
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:35,475
I'm wondering how I can get him to sign these urgent documents.

201
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,707
He gave me instructions about the documents.

202
00:19:42,707 --> 00:19:45,741
He's staying home today because of a fever.

203
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:49,364
I have to collect the documents and bring them to him in person.

204
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:54,070
I'll help you collect the documents, and you can take them to him.

205
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:59,627
But! There's a work emergency I must handle right away.

206
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:02,832
That's why I came to you.

207
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,496
These documents are very important.

208
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:10,020
Can you please bring them to Boss?

209
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,230
But I still have work to clear up.

210
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,743
That's okay. I've already checked with Boss.

211
00:20:16,743 --> 00:20:18,840
You don't have to do that work yet.

212
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,940
But these are important.

213
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,133
- Right?
<i>- Yes.</i>

214
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:28,258
Does this mean I have to go?

215
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:32,978
But I don't know where he lives.

216
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:36,864
I'll share his location with you. His place is not difficult to get to.

217
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:42,046
Please help me. Thank you.

218
00:20:43,257 --> 00:20:49,190
Nong Nim, since you're going to see Boss, please bring this to him too.

219
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,340
I'm so sorry, Nong Nim.

220
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,681
I need to take care of something. Otherwise, I would go myself.

221
00:20:55,681 --> 00:20:59,190
And that something is... getting coffee.

222
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:01,100
- Sure left first and didn't wait.
- Right. Let's go.

223
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,540
That's perfect.

224
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:08,050
Please tell Boss to get plenty of rest. Find him some food and give him medicine.

225
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,660
Right now, he's alone with no one to take care of him.

226
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,820
Thank you, Noom Nim-chan.

I'm here to see my boss—

234
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:03,716
I'm here to see Khun Akitsuki Koji.

235
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,733
Please give me your ID in exchange for an access card.

236
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:07,530
Sure.

237
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:15,120
Here you go.

238
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,206
Khun Koji's room number is PH4 on the 27th floor.

242
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,516
Hi, Boss.

243
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:11,850
Hi. What are you doing here?

244
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,680
Oh, Hazobe-san

245
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,360
had something to take care of so I came instead.

246
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,395
I'm sure that's his excuse not to come.

247
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:26,995
I guess I will have to cut his salary.

248
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:29,444
Please don't do that.

249
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:35,570
I'm sorry.

250
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,710
Did you really think I would do it?

251
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,630
You have some documents for me to sign, right?

252
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,196
- Yes.
- Come in.

253
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,229
What do you have for me?

254
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:31,390
So I brought...

255
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,180
corn soup, medicine, and fruits.

256
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,320
Did Hazobe ask you to get these things?

257
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,360
No.

258
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,460
I figured if you're sick

259
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:50,379
and can't go to work, it won't be good for the company.

260
00:25:51,657 --> 00:25:55,393
If you didn't want to see me this much, you shouldn't have come.

261
00:26:01,164 --> 00:26:03,060
Don't avoid eye contact with me.

262
00:26:06,063 --> 00:26:08,360
What are you peeping at?

263
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,500
Since you're sick, wouldn't it be better if you wore a shirt?

264
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,550
Why?

265

Here!

266
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,680

There's no need.

285

I will ask Khun Ploy to revise it.

Then you should have P'Ploy replace me as your secretary.

Can you tell me why?

299
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:28,217
I feel like I'm not suitable for the company.

300
00:30:28,946 --> 00:30:32,600
I joined because I wanted to be an interpreter,

301
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:40,940
but I have been asked to do many other things.

302
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:46,131
When you do something you're not good at, you often make mistakes.

303
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:51,172
Like with matters regarding Khun Mark and P'Ploy.

304
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:56,325
Ever since I joined, I feel like I've made things bad.

305
00:30:56,325 --> 00:30:59,020
Do I make you feel that uncomfortable?

306
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:05,997
No.

307
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,761

308
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:14,068
What is it? Is it about the photos?

309

I chose you to work with me

00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:26,112

but you're really good at your job.

314
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:45,095
What's wrong? You like touching your nose.

315
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:49,028
Are you sick? Did you catch it from me?

316
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:51,060
That's not it.

317
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:57,760
It's my habit. When I'm nervous, I like to do it.

318
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,765
It's strange, isn't it?

319
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:05,365
Not at all. It's cute.

324
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:34,419
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

325
00:32:36,545 --> 00:32:39,269
Actually, there's one thing.

326
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:45,392
About Khun Mark?

327
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:51,540
You're still angry that I spoke to you harshly that day

328
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,100
when you were with Khun Mark, right?

329
00:32:56,337 --> 00:32:58,705
About that day,

330
00:32:58,705 --> 00:33:00,579
I'm sorry.

331
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:08,431
I was just... angry.

332
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,092
I don't like seeing you with another guy,

333
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,585
so I acted idiotically.

334
00:33:19,182 --> 00:33:21,310
This is not about that.

335
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,910
Oh?

336
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:31,120
When are you going to eat the soup? You have to take your medicine afterward.

337
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,641
I can do that right now.

338
00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:36,446
Okay. I'll reheat it for you.

339
00:33:36,446 --> 00:33:40,270
♫ <i>Then please take responsibility</i> ♫

340
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:48,290
♫ <i>You make me confused about you, I don't want this</i> ♫

341
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,565
Hello, Khun Rena.

342
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:42,600
I haven't seen you for a while. Will you be staying in Thailand longer this time?

343
00:35:08,749 --> 00:35:12,638
What's wrong? Is the soup not good?

344
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:15,658
It's not that.

345
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:21,762
I'm thinking of someone.

346
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:25,659
She knows me best.

347
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:32,202
She knows I love corn soup,

348
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,275
so she brought me some every day.

349
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,922
But now she's gone.

350
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,422
I have seldom eaten it again.

351
00:35:54,763 --> 00:35:56,663
Who is she?

352
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,879
My mom.

353
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,589
When I was fifteen,

354
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:09,009
my mom got remarried.

355
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:14,068
I haven't eaten it since.

356
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,542
And I had to live alone.

357
00:36:24,203 --> 00:36:26,835
It was hard at first,

358
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,029
but I got through it.

359
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:38,192
By the way, do you know how to make corn soup?

360
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,429
I think there's a recipe on YouTube.

361
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:50,149
You know how to make it. That's good.

362
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:55,010
Then... when I want to eat corn soup,

363
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,520
can you make it for me, Nezumi-san?

364
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,479
Sure.

365
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:08,095
But now please eat this before it gets cold.

366
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,559
- What?
- It's hot.

367
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,411
I'm sorry.

368
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,923
It's still hot.

369
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:39,267
I'm sorry. It's still hot.

370
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,679
Boss!

371
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,986
I don't want to eat the soup anymore.

372
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:15,655
I will get the door for you.

373
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:43,490
Isn't this Koji's room?

374
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,957
Hey, Koji. How are you?

375
00:38:47,957 --> 00:38:50,229
What are you doing here?

376
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:52,486
I went to see you at the office.

377
00:38:52,486 --> 00:38:56,342
And they told me you were sick at home so I hurried here.

378
00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:58,763
How are you feeling? Have you taken your medicine?

379
00:38:58,763 --> 00:39:01,562
No. I'm about to.

380
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:05,779
You're always like this. You don't take care of yourself when I'm not around.

381
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:09,967
Let me see. Your temperature is quite high.

382
00:39:09,967 --> 00:39:12,178
No one's taken you to the hospital, right? Come on.

383
00:39:12,178 --> 00:39:14,546
- Let's go.
- No, it's okay.

384
00:39:14,546 --> 00:39:17,542
Noom Nim-san bought me some medicine.

385
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:20,562
This is Noom Nim-san, my secretary.

386
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:24,760
This is Matsuda Rena, executive director of our parent company.

387
00:39:25,377 --> 00:39:29,863
Hello. Nice to meet you, Khun Rena.

388
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:52,183
Take off your shirt. I will give you a tepid sponge bath.

389
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:55,800
There's no need. I'll just take my medicine.

390
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,757
You've never said no before.

391
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:03,440
Why? Are you feeling uncomfortable because there's someone else here?

392
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:26,665
You haven't told me what you're doing in Bangkok.

393
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,749
I heard there was an issue because Khun Mark didn't like the brand ambassador.

394
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:37,539
The problem may have already been fixed, but it's a problem nonetheless.

395
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:42,505
So I wanted to look into that and audit our company here.

396
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:59,182
I don't need a hotel room. I'm going to stay at Koji's as usual.

397
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:05,565
Why aren't you staying at a hotel?

398
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,800
I usually stay here, though.

399
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,190
Besides, I miss you so much.

400
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:17,240
There are so many things I want to talk with you about in bed.

401
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:25,169
Please excuse me, I'll be leaving. I have work to do.

402
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:27,226
Wait. I'll drive you.

403
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:31,766
It's fine. I can go by myself.

404
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:37,569
Please excuse me.

405
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:18,182
Hi, everyone. Many of you might recognize me because I was here last year.

406
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,899
For anyone who's new, I'm Matsuda Rena,

407
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:26,779
executive director of ViperX's parent company in Japan.

408
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:30,089
I'm here to audit this company like every year before.

409
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:38,394
Because of the issues with Khun Mark's case, I'm here to improve the system so it doesn't happen again.

410
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:41,915
Please take care of me.

411
00:42:43,949 --> 00:42:49,193
All right, the first thing we need to discuss for this year is...

412
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:52,215
the company's restructuring plan, as decided by the Japan office,

413
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:55,659
which our subsidiaries have to implement next year.

414
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,288
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

415
00:43:04,509 --> 00:43:06,050
Thank you.

416
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,930
Glad to see you are doing well.

417
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,111
- How are you doing?
- <i>Good</i>

418
00:43:15,243 --> 00:43:16,472
I'm happy.

419
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:19,937
Great.

420
00:43:19,937 --> 00:43:23,919
<i>- Shall we go out to eat? Come on!
- Sure. Let's go.</i>

421
00:43:23,919 --> 00:43:26,479
<i>Anytime is okay.</i>

422
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:31,499
<i>- How about sushi?
- Sushi would be fine.</i>

423
00:43:31,499 --> 00:43:35,757
<i>- Or yakiniku (Japanese barbecue)?
- Oh, yakiniku!</i>

424
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,615
Nezumi-san, you will be my secretary again from now on, okay?

425
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:22,089
Okay.

426
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,830
And also,

427
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,612
please set up a special office for Rena-san.

428
00:44:29,612 --> 00:44:31,522
There's no need.

429
00:44:31,522 --> 00:44:37,409
Don't go through the trouble. I already said that I'll use Koji's office as usual.

430
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:43,196
I'd also like a cup of coffee, Nezumi-san.

431
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:05,948
Rena-san is back and beautiful like a model.

432
00:45:05,948 --> 00:45:08,242
<i>That's true.</i>

433
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,709
Does everyone know Rena-san?

434
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:16,459
Of course, we do. She's our boss from headquarters.

435
00:45:16,459 --> 00:45:21,120
She's the reason we earn enough for a living today.

436
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:26,365
She's pretty, rich, smart, and kind.

437
00:45:26,365 --> 00:45:30,112
How many times will I need to be reborn to be like her?

438
00:45:30,112 --> 00:45:33,131
I really want to be born as Rena-san.

439
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:34,863
I know what you're planning.

440
00:45:34,863 --> 00:45:39,432
You want to be Rena-san because you want to get together with Boss, don't you?

441
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:41,380
Smartypants!

442
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:45,871
But really, no one is a better match for Boss than her.

443
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:48,369
He deserves that kind of woman.

444
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,959
Oh, I forgot to add the dish soap.

445
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,077
Wash it quickly.

446
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,532
P'In, do you want me to bring these documents for Khun Mark to sign?

447
00:46:30,532 --> 00:46:32,589
<i>I have something to consult with you.</i>

448
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:33,912
<i>What is it?</i>

449
00:46:33,912 --> 00:46:37,452
<i>Khun Nim, let me tell you this. Akitsuki-san is a womanizer.</i>

450
00:46:37,452 --> 00:46:38,659
<i>Hold on!</i>

451
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:41,472
<i>I told you I haven't finished talking.</i>

452
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:44,059
<i>Let go of me!</i>

453
