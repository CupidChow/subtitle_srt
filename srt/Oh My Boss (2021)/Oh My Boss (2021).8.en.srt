1
00:00:01,099 --> 00:00:04,299
<i>- Hey, what the hell?
- Noom Nim-san, we need to talk.</i>

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:08,239
<i>I will only kiss the person I want to kiss.</i>

3
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:11,819
<i>P'In, do you want me to bring these documents for Khun Mark to sign?</i>

4
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:16,367
<i>If the person who brings these documents to him is not you, he won't sign them.</i>

5
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:18,065
<i>Here's your coffee.</i>

6
00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:22,392
<i>- It's bitter.
- Still? I added quite a bit of sugar.</i>

7
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:25,159
<i>This is sweeter.</i>

8
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:28,912
<i>Ting? Did you see Nim-san?</i>

9
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:30,179
<i>Why are you avoiding my eyes?</i>

10
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,019
<i>What's your answer?</i>

11
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:34,239
<i>Khun Nim, let me tell you this.</i>

12
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:36,892
<i>Akitsuki-san is a womanizer.</i>

13
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:40,045
<i>If you aren't signing them, please excuse me.</i>

14
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:43,839
<i>Hold on! I told you, I haven't finished talking.</i>

15
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:47,743
<i>Let go of me!</i>

16
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:49,907
<i>Let go of me!</i>

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,979
<i>You don't have any right to do this to any woman!</i>

18
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:00,239
<i>I truly worry about you,</i>

19
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,692
<i>Nezumi-san. Will you be my girlfriend?</i>

20
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:07,469
<i>Please kindly take care of me from now on.</i>

21
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,320
‎<i>[Boss, Please Don't Flirt | Oh My Boss]</i>

22
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,480
‎‎♫ <i>Do you think you're the only one who feels this way</i> ♫

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,390
‎‎♫ <i>What you feel in your heart</i> ♫

24
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:43,670

25
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,410
‎‎♫ <i>Is it okay to only think like that</i> ♫

26
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,430

29
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:21,569
<i>Everything has turned pink.</i>

30
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:39,749
Will you be my girlfriend?

31
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,199
What?

32
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,139
Why are you shocked?

33
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:47,239
I just asked if Boss had already arrived.

34
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,879
Can you ask him to sign this?

35
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,285
Sure.

36
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:03,552
Will you be my girlfriend?

37
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,105
- What?
- Ah!

38
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:06,999
Why are you shocked?

39
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:11,459
I just asked why you did your makeup and dressed up today.

40
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,310
You startled me.

41
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,850
Oh my goodness.

42
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,739
<i>What's going on? Am I distracted?</i>

43
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:23,636
<i>No, I can't do that. I must keep calm and focus on my work.</i>

44
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:54,319
Please ask In-san to come to the conference room.

45
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:00,389
Okay.

46
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,249
Why did Nim-san have to be the person to bring the documents for Khun Mark to sign?

47
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:32,319
Oh, it was Khun Mark's request.

48
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,739
I didn't know how to refuse.

49
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:39,819
I was afraid he'd cancel our project if we didn't do what he asked.

50
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:44,179
But it is not Nim-san's responsibility.

51
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:55,119
I understand you want work to go smoothly.

52
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,349
And everything you do is for our company,

53
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:04,349
but it's important to care about your colleague's feelings too.

54
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:10,530
Nim-san...

55
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,030
helped you even though it wasn't her job,

56
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:21,669
and you still forced her to do what she didn't want to do?

57
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:30,039
You two will be working together for a very long time.

58
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,599
I want you to care more about each other's feelings.

59
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,419
I understand.

60
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:47,256
As for Khun Mark's matter, I will handle it myself.

61
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:52,269
Yes, Boss. I'm sorry.

62
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:08,809
Nong Nim, can we talk?

63
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:11,189
Sure.

64
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,980
Did you tell Boss

65
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,779
that I was the one who asked you to bring the contract to Khun Mark?

66
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,309
I thought we made an agreement yesterday.

67
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,979
But I didn't tell him that you asked me to do it.

68
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,119
Even though you didn't say it, Boss would have known anyway.

69
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:44,289
I felt really uncomfortable yesterday.

70
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,999
Uncomfortable?

71
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,570
Nong Nim,

72
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,770
do you want to ruin our company's project?

73
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:02,039
If Khun Mark cancels the project, what will you do?

74
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:07,949
I don't think not attending dinner with a client will hurt the company.

75
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,879
Nong Nim,

76
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:17,919
I even trusted you,

77
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:23,639
but you're extremely terrible and irresponsible.

78
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,039
Am I irresponsible?

79
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,939
Are you saying that to me?

80
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:37,679
I'm never irresponsible. I always care about my work.

81
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:43,469
But if there are any conditions outside the scope of work, I'm telling you I'm doing it.

82
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,592
Do you know what I went through?

83
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,599
I was sexually harassed.

84
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,132
What?

85
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,332
And you still want me to go see that man?

86
00:07:59,332 --> 00:08:02,209
You don't even know what he's like!

87
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:14,539
I didn't know... that something like this would happen.

88
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,039
I'm sorry, Nong Nim.

89
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:24,149
It's fine.

90
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,299
I didn't want it to happen, either.

91
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:33,359
I just want you to understand me a bit.

92
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:46,289
Hey... I-I had no idea what you went through.

93
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:49,865
If I had known, I wouldn't have blamed you.

94
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:54,499
Nong Nim, I'm sorry.

95
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:04,219
I heard that you called out your employee in the middle of the meeting.

96
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:06,719
You sure are protecting that girl.

97
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,199
She's not an ordinary secretary, is she?

98
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:14,305
This matter involves the employees in my company.

99
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:17,865
Are you saying I'm meddling?

100
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:25,839
You're more serious about her than I thought.

101
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,565
Did you forget about us?

102
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,212
Don't do this.

103
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:37,925
I've said it before. I don't want to say it again.

104
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,645
Gosh. I'm just kidding.

105
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:46,085
I'm not that forgetful.

106
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:51,559
I never forgot about us.

107
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,879
And about that thing you don't want anyone else to find out,

108
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,637
especially that girl,

109
00:09:57,637 --> 00:10:00,980
I also never forgot.

110
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,612
I made you rice balls.

111
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:49,059
You're better.

112
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:50,092
Excuse me?

113
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:53,028
You know how to protect yourself now.

114
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,199
What you said to In-san was very good.

115
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:02,809
Did you hear that?

116
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,739
I've got savory food.

117
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,378
Do you have any desserts for me?

118
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:17,319
I don't. I didn't prepare any.

119
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:19,162
I will go prepare some for you.

120
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:20,862
You have it.

121
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:27,169
Here it is.

122
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,979
Have you signed the documents?

123
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:36,499
Aren't your lips too pale?

124
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:38,312
You should freshen up your makeup.

125
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:40,579
And don't you have any manners?

126
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:41,959
What?

127
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:43,734
Shouldn't you knock first?

128
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:46,974
I normally don't knock, though.

129
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:52,672
And you, don't let me see your lips and face pale again.

130
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,992
I don't like it.

131
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,499
You may leave now. I need to teach my secretary a lesson.

132
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:09,455
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

133
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:13,728
I don't want Hazobe to know about us.

134
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,725
He has a big mouth.

135
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:20,159
It won't be good for you.

136
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,905
I'm sorry.

137
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:23,505
All right.

138
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,166
You should get back to work.

139
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,492
I'll see you in the evening.

140
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,359
What's going on?

141
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,263
You will find out soon enough.

142
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:05,709
So you asked me if I was free because you wanted to take me to a supermarket?

143
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:07,719
You make lunch boxes for me every day.

144
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:11,379
I should get to choose what I want to eat.

145
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:17,639
Fair enough, but...

146
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,412
Boss!

147
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,325
You should have told me.

148
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:24,323
Not this one. The other one is better.

149
00:13:24,323 --> 00:13:26,583
- It's the version with fat.
- This is high in fat.

150
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,879
Koji-san.

151
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:33,659
I don't want pumpkins.

152
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,389
No.

153
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,052
Hello, Akitsuki-san!

154
00:14:17,052 --> 00:14:19,109
Oh, hello Oba-san!

155
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,231
I haven't seen you in so long.

156
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:22,505
Are you here to shop for groceries?

157
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:25,749
Oh, yes, I came here to buy dinner for my wife.

158
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:28,069
What about you? Did you come with your wife?

159
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:31,847
Oh, no, no. This is Noom Nim-san. She's my secretary.

160
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,472
We ran into each other here.

161
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,559
Oh, really?

162
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:41,292
- I'm sorry. My wife needs me.
- Okay.

163
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:43,412
- Talk to you later
- Of course. Bye.

164
00:14:43,412 --> 00:14:45,829
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

165
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:50,611
He's a former client.

166
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,039
Thank you for sending me home.

167
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:11,129
I took you around until late at night. Your mom wouldn't say anything, would she?

168
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,309
She won't. It's not even midnight yet.

169
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:20,019
Give me that. I'll help you carry it.

170
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,040
It's okay.

171
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,492
It's no problem, I can carry it.

172
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:25,659
It's fine. Just give it to me.

173
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,140
It's totally fine.

174
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,030
Give it to me.

175
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,370
Like this?

176
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,084
- Are you sure?
- Give it to me.

177
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:38,640
It's okay. We can carry it like this.

178
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,380
Boss.

179
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,025
Where have you been? You're home late.

180
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:05,129
I went to the supermarket to buy some fresh groceries.

181
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,259
Who drove you home?

182
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:14,119
My boss.

183
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,029
Your boss? Why did he have to drive you home?

184
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:25,331
I was carrying a lot of stuff. He drove past and gave me a ride home.

185
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:29,719
He was driving past Ladprao all the way from Asoke?

186
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:34,259
There were a few of us. He sent my friends home too.

187
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,540
Noom Nim,

188
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,270
those Japanese bosses can't be trusted.

189
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:46,419
Some of them have family back in Japan and trick Thai women into being their mistresses.

190
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:49,425
Don't let them disrespect you.

191
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,299
You're exaggerating.

192
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:57,649
I'm not exaggerating. Look at Aunt Nid's daughter, who lives a street over from us.

193
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,183
Her daughter was so happy she found herself a Japanese husband,

194
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,474
but when she flew to Japan,

195
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:08,539
she found out he already had a family. She unknowingly became his mistress.

196
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:10,740
Not everyone is like that, though, Mom.

197
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,990
Don't generalize.

198
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:18,199
All in all, it's like that, Noom Nim. If the majority are like that,

199
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,272
you should be careful and behave yourself.

200
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:23,525
Don't get too close to your boss.

201
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:26,879
Other people may misunderstand you.

202
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,640
<i>[ViperX]</i>

203
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:54,652
Wow, you're such a good secretary, Noom Nim-san.

204
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:59,532
You remember your boss likes his coffee sweet.

205
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:04,812
She's my secretary. It's her job to remember every little detail.

206
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:37,759
<i>What are the reasons some people keep their relationship a secret?</i>

207
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,491
<i>I saw what you shared on Facebook. What were you rambling about?</i>

208
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:51,315
<i>Don't tell me you have a boyfriend.</i>

209
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,720
<i>I don't know. He's so good to me when we're alone,</i>

210
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,478
<i>but when there's someone else around, he acts like he doesn't want anyone to know about us.</i>

211
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,009
<i>Don't tell me you're dating your handsome Japanese boss.</i>

212
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:19,480
- Yes.
<i>- Oh my god!</i>

213
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,660
<i>My dear, Noom Nim! You're contributing to the peace between Thailand and Japan.</i>

214
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:31,079
Hold on. I'm still not sure how he feels about me.

215
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:34,229
<i>Why is that?</i>

216
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:41,345
<i>How about this? Bring him to meet us.</i>

217
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:43,445
<i>We'll check him for you.</i>

218
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:47,852
<i>If he's playing you, I'll make him pay.</i>

219
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,689
Should I do that?

220
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:08,779
How's work? Are you able to adapt yet?

221
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:16,218
It's going good.

222
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:21,179
I still have many things to learn, but it's been fun and challenging.

223
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,912
You sound like you're interviewing for a job.

224
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:26,685
Tell me what you really think.

225
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,026
Well...

226
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:34,476
You seem a bit tense whenever you're with me, Nim-san.

227
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:38,049
Are you afraid of me?

228
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:40,192
What did I do to make you afraid of me?

229
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,185
That's not it.

230
00:20:44,185 --> 00:20:49,692
Thai people always say "no" and "nothing" when asked a question.

231
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:51,599
It's annoying.

232
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,445
Trying to change this kind of habit is a fool's errand.

233
00:20:55,445 --> 00:21:00,832
Is there anything you want to say, Khun Rena? You can be direct.

234
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:06,759
Fine. Then I will ask you directly.

235
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:10,279
You and Koji are dating now, aren't you?

236
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:23,170
Forget it. You don't have to answer me. It's your private matter after all.

237
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,839
I would answer that,

238
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,569
but... I...

239
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:41,999
- I...
- It's okay. I can tell from your reaction.

240
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:47,921
On the one hand, you're so happy to date a perfect man like Koji.

241
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:52,789
But on the other hand, you're not confident about him, right?

242
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,689
Oh, Child,

243
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,799
do you know him well enough?

244
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,769
There are so many things you don't know about him.

245
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:12,549
Koji is more dangerous than you think.

246
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,438
<i>Oh, Child,</i>

247
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,596
<i>do you know him well enough?</i>

248
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,022
<i>There are so many things you don't know about him.</i>

249
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:48,305
<i>Koji is more dangerous than you think.</i>

250
00:22:53,729 --> 00:22:55,479
Boss.

251
00:22:56,769 --> 00:22:58,269
Yes?

252
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:07,545
Are you free this evening?

253
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,885
Yes, I'm free.

254
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,390
What do you want me to do?

255
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:16,952
I'm going to see my friends.

256
00:23:16,952 --> 00:23:18,749
Will you come with me?

257
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,498
Sure.

258
00:23:21,498 --> 00:23:27,502
I would go anywhere if I got to go with my Nezumi-san.

259
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,659
Okay.

260
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:37,999
- Hello. Dubai Luxury is pleased to welcome you. You may enter.
- Thank you.

261
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,999
Where are your friends?

262
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:42,499
Over there.

263
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,430
I'll take the bald guy. I want to lick his head.

264
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,579
- They're not here yet!
- Oh, there they are.

265
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:51,822
You finally got here.

266
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:54,070
Hello, Akitsuki-san.

267
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,993
- Hi.
- Hi. Please have a seat.

268
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:04,956
Excuse me, can we have another plate? Thanks.

269
00:24:04,956 --> 00:24:06,732
- I'm Poppy.
- I'm Meow.

270
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:08,145
- I'm Pinn.
- I'm Poppy.

271
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:10,892
- I'm Meow.
- That's enough.

272
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,499
Last time I was wasted, I didn't see your face clearly until now.

273
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:23,179
You're so perfectly, stunningly, and painfully handsome.

274
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:24,992
He's so handsome that I'm jealous of you, Nim!

275
00:24:24,992 --> 00:24:29,619
Stop. Don't hit on your friend's man, Poppy.

276
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:32,412
Please make yourself comfortable.

277
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:36,692
By the way, Khun Koji, you speak and understand Thai, right?

278
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:37,902
Yes, I do.

279
00:24:37,902 --> 00:24:43,082
Oh, he does! So smart. That means you've been living in Thailand for a while, right?
- So smart!

280
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,225
- It's been several years.
- Oh!

281
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:48,162
So are you living here permanently?

282
00:24:48,162 --> 00:24:50,299
- I go back sometimes.
<i>- Right.</i>

283
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:51,480
Who do you go back to?

284
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,980
Your wife and children?

285
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,649
What are you guys talking about?

286
00:24:57,219 --> 00:25:00,999
I'm sorry. My friends are just talking nonsense.

287
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:03,532
Sure.

288
00:25:03,532 --> 00:25:06,669
Excuse me while I go to the bathroom.

289
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,572
You fool! What were you saying? He ran away. Look.

290
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:21,119
I was helping you as a friend. Why are you scolding me?

291
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,719
He's right. We should ask him directly.

292
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:28,479
This reaction of going to the bathroom means he went to get ahold of his bearings.

293
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:30,392
He's acting suspiciously.

294
00:25:30,392 --> 00:25:33,148
I'll tell him you guys are teasing him.

295
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:34,556
<i>Hey!</i>

296
00:25:34,556 --> 00:25:37,832
- What the heck?
- I wasn't teasing him, though.

297
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:42,689
Boss.

298
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,245
I'm sorry about my friends.

299
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:56,392
They like to mess with other people like that.

300
00:25:56,392 --> 00:25:58,052
I'm sorry.

301
00:25:58,052 --> 00:26:00,111
It's all right.

302
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:03,449
I think they just want to get to know me.

303
00:26:05,616 --> 00:26:09,169
I already told them not to tease you again.

304
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:13,679
It's totally fine. I'm okay. Don't think too much.

305
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,625
Excuse me while I quickly take this call.

306
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,299
You can go back to your friends first.

307
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,059
It's possible that he already has a wife and children. Don't you think so?

308
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:47,925
Having a wife and kids isn't as scary as him having a husband.

309
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:50,439
That's too much. Aren't you two going over the top?

310
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,872
It's true. I think it's the truth.

311
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:53,159
It's possible.

312
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,199
You guys can stop teasing him now.

313
00:26:57,639 --> 00:27:01,092
You're being soft-hearted.

314
00:27:01,092 --> 00:27:03,570
Don't you want to know what secret he's keeping anymore?

315
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,639
That's right. Nim, we've already discussed it.

316
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:08,395
There's something suspicious about him.

317
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:11,295
I'm so sorry. A work emergency came up.

318
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:14,645
Tonight was so much fun, but I must go.

319
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:16,996
I'll see you next time.

320
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:19,025
- Okay, Boss.
- Okay.

321
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:26,572
I told you. As soon as we questioned him, he found a way to escape.

322
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:27,796
Right!

323
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:31,019
What did he mean by fun? He didn't eat or laugh at all.

324
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:33,139
- What the heck was fun?
- Right. I didn't hear him laughing.

325
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:37,465
He has to go take care of his work. It's urgent.

326
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:41,545
What work is that? You're his secretary. Do you know what it is?

327
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:42,899
Yes, tell us.

328
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:45,670
- What work is that?
- So?

329
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,019
Complete silence.

330
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:50,392
See? You're his secretary, but you don't even know.

331
00:27:50,392 --> 00:27:54,000
- It's so late already. What work is he doing? Isn't it suspicious?
<i>- For sure.</i>

332
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,819
He has... a wife.

333
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:57,379
- He has a husband!
- A wife!

334
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,584
Yes.

335
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:01,149
Can you come to your senses?

336
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:03,209
You're loud. It's embarrassing.

337
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:06,172
Why? We've been loud since we arrived.

338
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:08,268
I know they're listening to us.

339
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:10,140
I want them to know what we're talking about.

340
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,100
<i>[Osaka, Japan]</i>

341
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,971
You came back early.

342
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:23,105
Isn't it unusual for you to come back so soon?

343
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:27,305
There's no reason for me to stay.

344
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,259
Didn't you say you would check out Akitsuki's new girl?

345
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:32,729
You said that, right?

346
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,844
Oh, you're here, too.

347
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,570
I'll get the usual, please.

348
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,445
Yes, Sir.

349
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,365
I met Akitsuki's woman already.

350
00:28:55,725 --> 00:28:58,569
What do you think? Was she like what I told you?

351
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:02,092
She's more ordinary than I thought,

352
00:29:02,092 --> 00:29:04,659
but there's something unexpected about her.

353
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:10,149
What's more unexpected is Akitsuki-san.

354
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:15,339
What? Does that mean the rumor is true?

355
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,099
Yes.

356
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:20,039
Will you not do anything about it?

357
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:24,639
An innocent girl like her

358
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,739
won't be able to do anything if Koji is not there to protect her.

359
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:32,549
She can't beat me.

360
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,999
Relax.

361
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:39,930
I know you're worried,

362
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,790
but she's just an ordinary girl.

363
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:50,090
Am I worried?

364
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:55,589
The one who should be worried is you.

365
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,385
You can't even handle a simple girl.

366
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,765
I tried my best.

367
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:08,979
I did it for you, Rena-san.

368
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,852
Is that so?

369
00:30:14,449 --> 00:30:19,832
Then from now on, you don't have to try to do anything for me anymore

370
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:23,819
because I don't need your useless attempts at trying.

371
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:42,703
He came all the way here.

372
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:46,223
Shouldn't you be nicer to him?

373
00:30:47,249 --> 00:30:49,052
It's not necessary.

374
00:30:49,052 --> 00:30:55,139
I no longer want to give him any false hope.

375
00:30:55,139 --> 00:31:01,357
Well, these documents you sent me, can I give them to the president?

376
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:03,912
Yes. Please do.

377
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,708
Here's your coffee.

378
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,562
Thank you.

379
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:26,129
Is something the matter, Nezumi-san?

380
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:29,507
It's nothing.

381
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:36,070
Your mouth says no,

382
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,610
but your eyes say yes.

383
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:41,825
I've told you before

384
00:31:41,825 --> 00:31:45,332
that if you're curious about something, you should ask me.

385
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,199
I'm curious.

386
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,069
About what?

387
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:53,799
Are we really lovers?

388
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:56,792
Why are you asking that?

389
00:31:58,476 --> 00:32:00,799
Because I can't guess your emotions.

390
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,287
Sometimes you're good to me, sometimes you act like you don't care about me at all.

391
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:08,149
I feel like I'm just your secretary.

392
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:11,405
I honestly don't know what to do.

393
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:17,339
Did I make you overthink that much?

394
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:21,849
I'm sorry, but I feel really uncomfortable.

395
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:27,149
Like last night when you left saying you had work,

396
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:29,789
was there any work at that time of night?

397
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:33,459
Also, I'm your secretary. Why didn't I know anything about it?

398
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:35,959
I really left for work.

399
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:38,805
It was urgent work that came in.

400
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:45,395
I saw you were having fun with your friends so I didn't want to bother you.

401
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,745
Besides, it's outside working hours.

402
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:54,759
I see.

403
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,859
Stop.

404
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,665
What are you doing?

405
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:25,899
Making someone who's worried, not worry.

406
00:33:27,189 --> 00:33:31,983
But we're in the office. Someone could come in.

407
00:33:31,983 --> 00:33:38,029
We will be fine. I told them not to come in.

408
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:39,889
I'm sorry.

409
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:44,759
Are you still angry?

410
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,119
Yes.

411
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,310
Lately,

412
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:07,200
there have been many things I've had to worry about. I'm tired.

413
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,659
Are you tired?

414
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,579
Yes.

415
00:34:25,172 --> 00:34:30,179
Can you hug me? So I can relieve my tiredness.

416
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:42,599
<i>Those Japanese bosses can't be trusted.</i>

417
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:48,772
<i>Some of them have family back in Japan and trick Thai women into being their mistresses.</i>

418
00:34:48,772 --> 00:34:52,019
<i>Don't let them disrespect you.</i>

419
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:53,949
Did your tiredness go away now?

420
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,465
Almost.

421
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:02,459
What can I do to relieve your tiredness?

422
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:08,932
I can't do that. We're in the office.

423
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:12,939
Please. I just want to be close to you.

424
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,112
Please?

425
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,129
Just a little, okay?

426
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:33,792
- Who's there?
- Good morning.

427
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,570
Nim-chan, are you all right?

428
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:44,703
Oh, I'm thirsty. Excuse me.

429
00:35:44,703 --> 00:35:47,492
Oh, Nim-chan?

430
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:49,012
Nim-chan?

431
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:51,422
Where is she hurrying off to?

432
00:35:51,422 --> 00:35:54,912
Boss, did you bully her?

433
00:35:54,912 --> 00:35:58,812
Wow, you're getting scarier every day.

434
00:35:58,812 --> 00:36:01,052
Why do you hate me so much?

435
00:36:01,052 --> 00:36:04,272
I only asked you a question.

436
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:06,185
Why did you come in?

437
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:08,739
If there's nothing, you can leave.

438
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:11,969
I just wanted to warn you about Rena.

439
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:17,069
What is it?

440
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:19,605
She went back to Japan.

441
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:23,005
It looks like she's planning something.

442
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,019
I don't care what she's doing.

443
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:35,169
Boss, it will be good to be careful.

444
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,465
He hasn't replied for two days already.

445
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:56,239
<i>I should send him a complaining message.
[What time is it in Korea right now?]</i>

446
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,392
<i>Oh, I knew it. There's no smoke without fire.</i>

447
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:03,825
<i>There must be something between Boss and Rena-san.</i>

448
00:37:03,825 --> 00:37:08,399
<i>See? It feels so good holding hands like this.</i>

449
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:09,999
<i>What kind of first date is this?</i>

450
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:12,379
<i>Are you bringing me here to buy a mobile phone?</i>

451
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:15,005
<i>Our first date begins after this.</i>

452
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:24,125
<i>The souvenir I've prepared for you is still in my room.</i>

453
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:26,645
<i>This was your plan to trick me into going to your place.</i>

454
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,872
<i>Boss, what are you doing?!</i>

455
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:32,119
<i>Koji-san, there's a mark!</i>

456
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,865
<i>Noom Nim, are you home already?</i>

457
00:37:34,865 --> 00:37:37,332
<i>What's wrong with your neck?</i>

458
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:59,420
♫ <i>Even though I love you more than anyone else</i> ♫

459
