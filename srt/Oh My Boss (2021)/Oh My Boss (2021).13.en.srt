Have you guys heard about the new COO from Japan?

9
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,950
This new COO will be restructuring and reshuffling some roles.

10
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,060
It's been a while, Ms. Noom Nim.

11
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,000
Whose lipstick is on the glass? It's Ms. Rena's, isn't it?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,290
Yes.

00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,686
Can you come here again tomorrow?

17
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,868
Please visit the host club too.

18
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:27,746
If you always directly hire me outside like this, the club will be in trouble.

19
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,190
You're right. I haven't been there for some time already.

20
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,460
Have you ever thought about having a boyfriend for real?

21
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,800
Nope.

22
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,880
Having a friend who is good in bed like you is more than enough for me.

23
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,800
Why did you ask me that?

24
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,180
Don't tell me that you've changed your mind and now want to have a girlfriend.

25
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,640
Nope.

26
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,870
I told you before that I'm not interested in that.

27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,220
I'm just... worried about you.

28
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,020
I'm worried whether it's good for you to keep being with me like this.

29
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,759
Of course, it's good.

30
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,389
You think it's not?

31
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,989
I myself don't have any problem with that...

32
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,800
since you're paying me a lot.

33
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,720
Who will fall in love

34
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,063
with a dangerous guy like you?

35
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:52,426
Don't be too into yourself.

36
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,618
That's good...

37
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,830
since I see you as my close friend,

38
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,829
and I don't want you to be sad.

39
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,353
You're here? What about your boyfriend?

40
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,703
Mr. Koji can't make it today. He has an urgent business.

41
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:39,610
Really? I've almost finished arranging our dinner.

42
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,350
I thought I would get to see him.

43
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,830
He really wanted to come, but he's having an urgent business. He has to take care of the client.

44
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,710
It's alright. It can't be helped. Poor him.

45
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,957
It's the weekend, but he stills need to work.

46
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,840
So, your boyfriend is a scaredy cat?

47
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,880
He's too afraid to meet me and Mom, so he ran away?

48
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,850
Did you even listen to what I just said? I said he had an urgent business.

49
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,232
We can have dinner later whenever we want. Next week will also do.

50
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:18,570
Why?

51
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,883
Poor you, my sis.

52
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:24,123
You dress up so beautifully, but end up being ditched.

53
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,490
Ditched?!

54
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,570
- Ditched?
- Enough!

55
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,053
Not at all! We just went on a date earlier.

56
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:34,350
It's none of your business. Just do your work.

57
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,467

61
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,860
Hello, Ms. Noom Nim.

62
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,490
Yes.

63
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,480
What is it?

64
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,500
I'm having a thank you party celebrating the success of our campaign,

65
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,700
so I would like to invite you to join.

66
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,560
What do you mean again?

67
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,340
I'm sorry for informing you on such a short notice. I'm truly sorry.

68
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,990
At first, I planned to just have a party within my team,

69
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:36,280
but since ViperX has also contributed to our success,

70
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,159
I would like you to also have fun together with us.

71
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:43,031
But I haven't been informed about it earlier,

72
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:47,180
so I guess I can't make it. I just arrived home.

73
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,973
Anyway, please enjoy.

74
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:54,880
That's strange. I thought Mr. Akitsuki had informed you already.

75
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,520
It's alright. If you change your mind, you can always join us.

76
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,820
But he didn't tell me about it at all.

77

<i>This is so sudden, Inn.</i>

80
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,500
<i>Everything in the party is free. Our colleagues and I are here already.</i>

81
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,785
<i>We want you to also join us.</i>

82
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,434
<i>Let me think about it.</i>

83
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:55,170
<i>Just come, Nim. Or are you up to anything better tonight?</i>

84

Everything is going as planned.

85
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,020
Good.

86
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,277
I've gotta go.

87
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,200
You're here on time. I thought you would be late because of your girlfriend.

88
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,960
Hey, aren't we going to talk first?

89
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,223
Let's quickly end it.

90
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:51,640
Hold on.

91
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,649
You're so impatient.

92
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,689
In the past, you were much gentler.

93
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,159
Stop talking too much.

94
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,922
Let's quickly get it done so I can finally be set free.

95
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,020
You love that girl so much that you allow yourself to do this much, don't you?

96
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,559
I guess you told her that you would be out for while. Right?

97
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,619
That's why you're in such a hurry.

98
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:21,359
Call her again now.

99
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:24,320
Tell her that you have to stay late tonight for work,

100
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,199
so you can stay with me here longer and don't have to be in a hurry.

101
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:33,259
Your little girl is going to believe you for sure.

102
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:38,899
She's so innocent, and she really trusts you so she won't doubt it.

103
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:45,199
Don't talk about her like that.

104
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:52,239
Why?! Are you really that afraid that she will find out about us?

105
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:00,789
Go out with me.

106
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:03,401
Where are we going?

107
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:11,056
You'll know when we arrive. You have to stay with me all night anyway.

108
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,079
You're finally here, Ms. Noom Nim.

109
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,139
Hello, Mr. Mark.

110
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:27,629
Where are others?

111
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:29,329
They're inside.

112
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:33,001
I'll take you there.

113
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:39,372
It's alright. I'll wait for them to pick me up here.

114
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,097
You still don't trust me yet?

115
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:46,122
I won't do anything to you. Don't worry.

116
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:48,259
Let's go. I'll take you inside.

117
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,939
Thank you.

118
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:57,602
Over there, right? I can go on my own.

119
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:25,019
- Hi.
- You're here!

120
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,479
Come here.

121
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:30,179
Nim, they're Mr. Mark's crews.

122
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,729
This is Ms. Noom Nim.

123
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,279
Here you are.

124
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,500
Noom Nim,

125
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,600
he asked whether you're single or not.

126
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,110
Well, cheers!

127
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,500


128
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,240


129
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,659
Why do we have to do it like Japanese do? I'm already tired of them.

130
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:03,259
True. We drink sake every day. That's boring.

131
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:06,233
I want vodka instead.

132
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:11,289
I'm here at this party, and I've been working so hard all along

133
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:15,999
just because there're tons of good-looking guys!

134
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,579
Including you, Mr. Mark!

135
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:24,399
If we compare guys to liquors,

136
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,539
Mr. Minei must be red wine that is discreet and calm.

137
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:31,249
What about Mr. Hazobe?

138
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:33,439
Hazobe?

139
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:37,752
He can't be anything else but beer. He's kind of bold and manly.

140
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:40,659
What about Mr. Akitsuki?

141
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:46,299
This one is tough.

142
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,009
Sometimes, he looks gentle like brandy,

143
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,959
but sometimes he turns hot like tequila.

144
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:58,139
Or maybe sake?

145
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,719
It's the gentle taste that hits your throat hard.

146
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,062
Let's put all the shots over here and drink all from all countries, shall we?

147
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:13,059
Hey, if you want to gossip, keep your voice down.

148
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,479
Otherwise, those you gossip about might hear it.

149
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:20,199
How can they hear us, Mr. Mark?

150
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,192
There he is. The person you just gossiped about is upstairs.

151
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:28,249
Hey, that's Boss for real.

152
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:34,439
That's Ms. Rena!

153
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:43,049
Exactly. Boss is here with Ms. Rena. It seems that the rumor is true.

154
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:44,679
What rumor?

155
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,939
About Boss and Ms. Rena.

156
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:03,649
Why don't you drink at all?

157
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:06,769
Or do you want me to drink it all alone?

158
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,850
I don't feel like drinking.

159
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,609
Drink some, so you'll feel lively.

160
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:20,579
This is my order. This is my order. I ordered you to drink.

161
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,979
Here you are. I drank it all up. Happy now?

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,389
there's no chance that you could even become the CEO of ViperX.

164
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,719
So, don't do like this to me.

165
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,759
Then tell me what I have to do.

166
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,769
Kiss me like you used to do.

167
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:13,599
Why? You can't?

168
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:17,439
When you were in my room earlier, you could do it.

169
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,629
Do exactly like what you did here.

170
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:23,419
I want you to do the same thing here.

171
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:26,562
Come on. Go ahead.

172
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:38,793
If doing this can finally end everything,

173
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:42,790
I'll do it.

174
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,939
Is this real?

175
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:12,909
That's so passionate!

176
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:14,939
Can I film this?

177
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:17,643
It's going to be a big news in our company!

178
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,130


179
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,600


180
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,699
Where is she going?

181
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:47,640
Ms. Noom Nim. Ms. Noom Nim.

182
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,309
Calm down first.

183
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,040
Don't pretend to tell me to calm down!

184
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,420
You invited me here because you want me to see this, didn't you?

185
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,157
Why are you thinking like that?

186
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:04,899
I'm not dumb. I know that you two have planned it.

187
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,829
Ms. Noom Nim, why do you think I'm that wicked?

188
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,239
I invited you here because I want you to relax.

189
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,459
But it turns out that you think it's a plot.

190
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:17,719
I'm slighted now.

191
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:21,990
Why don't you think that Mr. Akitsuki just showed his true colors?

192
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:25,693
Just like what I kept telling you before that you don't know him well enough!

193
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:30,106
Enough of that! Stop pretending already!

194
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:50,389
Mr. Koji!

195
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:54,419
Oops, that's our employee.

196
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,429
She saw us.

197
00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:59,596
What should we do then?

198
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:02,626
While we're doing "something".

199
00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:05,439
But you won't tell anyone, will you?

200
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,949
Because although we kiss or do other things,

201
00:18:09,949 --> 00:18:15,079
a low-level employee like you mustn't question it anyway.

202
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,679
Ms. Rena!

203
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:22,060
Ms. Nezumi, there's something behind what you see.

204
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:26,042
- You must trust me.
- You don't have to say anything anymore.

205
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:35,219
I'm not just a low-level employee,

206
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:40,229
but I'm also his girlfriend.

207
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:49,679
But it's just that now I'm no longer sure whether he still wants me or not.

208
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,629
Ms. Nezumi, you must listen to me.

209
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:56,999
If you're going to choose it this way, then make it clear! Tell her that we've been hooking up for so long, and we've gone so far already!

210
00:18:56,999 --> 00:19:00,469
Ms. Rena! That's enough!

211
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:04,199
I did everything that you wanted already.

212
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:08,279
Can you please do as agreed?

213
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,419
Hey, are you really so scared that this girl will find out about it?

214
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:16,839
You can continue deceiving yourself as well as this airhead girl, but the truth is always what it is.

215
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:20,829
This girl can never accept how your past was and who you actually are.

216
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:24,746
I'm the only person who knows the other side of you!

217
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,989
Ms. Nezumi! Ms. Nezumi!

218
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,189
You once told me that you would only kiss the person you wanted to kiss.

219
00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:56,029
I shouldn't have believed you.

220
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,759
Hold on, Ms. Nezumi.

221
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,882
Let go of me.

222
00:19:58,882 --> 00:20:03,052
I know Rena because I used to work at a host club.

223
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,359
Huh?

224
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,470
‎

225
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,310
<i>­</i>

226
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,794
We're leaving, Boss.

227
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:23,174
Go home safely.

228
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:37,789
You're Akitsuki Koji, right?

229
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:39,309
Yes.

230
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,627
But then I got impeded by the yakuza,

231
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:20,549
so I decided to quit.

232
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:48,147
I just heard about it. What do you mean by saying that we won't see each other anymore?

233
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,172
I already sold the club. That means I can't be hired by you anymore.

234
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:02,149
So, what are you thinking of doing next?

235
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,809
Maybe, I'll try to start a new business.

236
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:12,190
This time, I'll go with a plain one...

237
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,789
that can be operated during day time and won't displease any mafia.

238
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:19,309
In that case, I can help.

239
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:24,012
You know who I am, don't you?

240
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:26,792
If I just say it, my dad will help.

241
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:38,669
And why would you do that for me?

242
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,539
Because we are friends, aren't we?

243
00:22:54,499 --> 00:23:00,129
Since then, I've started my job at ViperX...

244
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:04,136
which belongs to Rena's father.

245
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,119
Thank you.

246
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:06,739
Actually, it's my fault.

247
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,779
Though I know her feeling towards me all along,

248
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:19,382
I pretend not to realize it since it's a more comfortable path for me.

249
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:28,849
I never thought that what I did would hurt her...

250
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:32,043
and would finally get back at me.

251
00:24:32,043 --> 00:24:36,679
Ms. Nezumi, I never love her.

252
00:24:39,016 --> 00:24:41,229
And there's nothing going on between us now.

253
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,359
Everything has ended.

254
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,362
But it still seemed that it hasn't ended.

255
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:47,149
It's not like that.

256
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:49,798
I kissed her because...

257
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:52,345
You wanted to keep her lips sealed, right?

258
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,725
Because you don't want me to find out about it.

259
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:00,242
And if there's really nothing between you two,

260
00:25:00,242 --> 00:25:03,198
why didn't you want to tell me about it?

261
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,182
Ms. Nezumi...

262
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:13,522
I don't care about your past.

263
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:16,199
I don't care who you dated or how many girls you dated.

264
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:18,739
I never care...

265
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:25,069
because the person I love is Mr. Koji now, not Mr. Koji of the past.

266
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:27,719
But what made me sad...

267
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:34,713
I was sad because you decided to do like that instead of telling me the truth.

268
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:42,946
Because you think that if I find out about your past, I can't take it, right?

269
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,879
But I can.

270
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:52,379
I can accept everything, except for what you just did!

271
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:56,104
I can't stand seeing you two kiss like that!

272
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:59,239
Ms. Nezumi, I love you.

273
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,642
Let go of me!

274
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,202
Ms. Nezumi...

275
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:05,891
I told you to let go of me!

276
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:24,329
Ms. Nezumi!

277
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,537
Hey, here's the water.

278
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,269
Here it is.

279
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:05,345
You're just lying miserably.

280
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,659
It's been two days already.

281
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:21,202
But anyway, you have been working so hard. It's good to take some rest.

282
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:51,479
Are you okay?

283
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,489
Fairly.

284
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:00,269
If you need any help, just let me know.

285
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:03,799
Or you can just consult with me.

286
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,640
Mom,

287
00:29:19,862 --> 00:29:22,039
if I quit my job,

288
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:27,059
is it going to be alright?

289
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,799
Pardon?

290
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:40,610
I see that Nut now has a proper job.

291
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:47,736
Previously, I have worked hard because I want to help lighten our family's burden.

292
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,678
But...

293
00:29:53,868 --> 00:29:59,670
if I take a break,

294
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,260
change my job or whatever,

295
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,459
it's going to be fine, isn't it?

296
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:14,839
Nim, you don't need to worry about that anymore.

297
00:30:15,886 --> 00:30:18,331
I've already managed to solve it.

298
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:22,942
Have you?

299
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:26,150
How could you do that?

300
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:33,639
Well, someone offered me help.

301
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:39,119
Anyway, think carefully about your Boss.

302
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:41,679
Try to talk to each other.

303
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,247
I have no more to say.

304
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:36,817
Please talk to me outside, Nezumi.

305
00:31:56,269 --> 00:31:58,140
In the past,

306
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,590
I never cared about anything...

307
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:09,435
because I thought that everyone was selfish.

308
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:15,775
Actually, I'm mean.

309
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:20,396
I made love with every girl just for my own benefit.

310
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:30,009
I'm not as perfect as what you thought.

311
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:36,119
I already told you that I never care about

312
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,432
who you used to be or what you used to do.

313
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:47,139
The person I love is this Koji.

314
00:32:52,582 --> 00:32:54,368
I know.

315
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,539
I know that you love me.

316
00:33:29,489 --> 00:33:31,930
I didn't tell you because

317
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:36,970
I was afraid that you would hate me...

318
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,800
and wouldn't want to date me at all.

319
00:33:40,681 --> 00:33:45,929
But now I know that you don't care about it.

320
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,276
But...

321
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,482
for kissing Rena,

322
00:33:59,712 --> 00:34:01,719
I'm sorry.

323
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:16,150
You are the only thing in my life that makes me happy.

324

But from now on, you mustn't hide any secret from me.

I must know everything about you.

Until now, they've allowed flexibility at ViperX Thailand to align with the target country.

We're going to replace the whole management team.

I need to talk to you as well.

That you're the reason your colleagues got laid off?

Or you want some sex advice?
