When you're off work, stop calling me Boss already.

9
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,380
Then,

10
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,640
I'll call you Mr. Koji.

11
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,640
Can you stay here with me for one more night?

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,080
Since you're being so adorably clingy like this, I guess I must give in.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,890
[10 years ago - Osaka, Japan]

14
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,120
So this is where you've been hiding.

15
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:38,336
Koji,

16
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:41,800
you've been working here for a while now.

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,164
Do you like it?

18
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,893
Well, it's not bad.

19
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:51,213
Not bad?

20
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:53,600
Good and not bad are not the same thing.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,260
Good means good. Not bad means there are bad days.

22
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,460
Is that right?

23
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,571
I feel so-so. I have both good and bad days.

24
00:02:10,592 --> 00:02:14,270
Understandable. This job is about pleasing people.

25
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,480
On days you're upset, you probably don't want to please anyone.

26
00:02:19,284 --> 00:02:22,370
But let me tell you this.

27
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,480
Whatever job you have in this world,

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,680
if you don't care about it you will never go anywhere.

29
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,920
And you may have less chance of leaving this place.

30
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
So,

31
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,644
what do I have to do?

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,946
Wait here.

33
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,540
That girl. Remember her.

34
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,336
She's still young. She's around the same age as you.

35
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:06,366
She's a regular, who's a millionaire's daughter.

36
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:09,486
You should befriend her.

37
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:13,372
If you can make her like you,

38
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:17,316
I guarantee the opportunity you're looking for will come to you.

39
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:19,006
Give it a try.

40
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:36,946
Are you ready?

41
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:43,876
I am.

42
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:51,444
It's going to be okay.

43
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:57,080
Just say what you think

44
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,900
and let your mother take care of the rest.

45
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:06,256
I'll go then.

46
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:48,126
Take care.

47
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,180
Call me if you need anything.

48
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:13,636
Nim, I love you.

49
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:38,506
Mom.

50
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:41,006
Nut.

51
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:46,129
- I...
- You don't have to say anything.

52
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,606
I don't know if it's too late to say this,

53
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,358
but Mom and I...

54
00:06:57,406 --> 00:06:59,622
are really sorry, Nim.

55
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:08,656
When I raised my voice at you the other day,

56
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:14,206
I know you're hurt.

57
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:21,740
I admit that I'm short-tempered

58
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,720
and never listen to your reasons.

59
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,876
I'm so sorry for doing that.

60
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:34,976
Mom bought me a car...

61
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:40,606
because she wanted me to get a job and make some money

62
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:43,326
so I can take some burden off your shoulders.

63
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:46,866
It's my fault that I'm useless.

64
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:49,599
You're not.

65
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,507
Don't try to make me feel better.

66
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:58,426
I know very well that I'm good-for-nothing.

67
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:01,246
No.

68
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:03,670
I'm your older brother,

69
00:08:04,446 --> 00:08:06,606
but I'm not as good at school as you.

70
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:09,226
I can't get a good job.

71
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:14,239
I'm really sorry.

72
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,754
But I promise...

73
00:08:20,546 --> 00:08:22,846
I will try harder.

74
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:26,326
I will try to become a better person.

75
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:30,346
Actually,

76
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,450
if we're blaming anyone,

77
00:08:34,336 --> 00:08:36,996
I should be blamed too.

78
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:41,686
I've raised the two of you by myself.

79
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:47,320
Sometimes I don't know

80
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,370
what's right...

81
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:53,266
or what I should do.

82
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,526
If I make a mistake,

83
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:03,016
you can tell me.

84
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:07,516
I will try to fix it and make every day better.

85
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:12,926
Why the long speech?

86
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:15,636
It's not a big deal, Mom.

87
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:19,556
Everyone makes mistakes.

88
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,126
Besides, you've only become a mother when you had Nut and me.

89
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:29,346
It's okay.

90
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,556
That's right.

91
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:40,233
This is our first time being your children as well.

92
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:41,309
Right?

93
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:43,009
Yes.

94
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:49,616
What are you guys talking about?

95
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,856
I love you both.

96
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:00,166
I love you, too.

97
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,596
How are you?

98
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:18,859
We had a long heart-to-heart and have just gone to bed.

99
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:20,795
Are you okay?

100
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:25,406
I guess.

101
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:28,036
What do you mean?

102
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:32,596
I think everything is getting better.

103
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:37,806
Nut has promised to find a full-time job and help pay the mortgage.

104
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:42,946
For now, we're going to sell the car to get rid of the burden.

105
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,521
That's good.

106
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:49,886
Thank you.

107
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:53,096
For what?

108
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:58,566
Thank you for letting me come home.

109
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,469
I didn't do anything.

110
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:06,869
I just told you a story about my past.

111
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,376
By the way, are you free some time soon?

112
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:18,446
Yes, why?

113
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,206
my mom would like to invite you to join us for dinner at home.

114
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:30,006
Oh.

115
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:34,076
Mom wants me to introduce my boyfriend to her.

116
00:11:35,806 --> 00:11:39,669
Of course. Just tell me when.

117
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:42,796
You know my schedule.

118
00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:45,366
Feel free to arrange it.

119
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:50,579
Okay. I'll schedule it then.

120
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:54,526
One more thing.

121
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:57,646
The room key.

122
00:11:57,646 --> 00:12:00,256
Hmm? The room key?

123
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:02,346
Whose room?

124
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,246
Mine. I put it in your bag.

125
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:07,096
Don't forget to check it out.

126
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:09,266
Your room key?

127
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,586
It's late. I'm going to sleep now.

128
00:12:13,586 --> 00:12:15,998
See you at the office.

129
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:17,886
Goodnight.

130
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:27,656
<i>♫ Do you think you're the only one who feels this way? ♫</i>

131
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:33,746
<i>♫ Do you think I don't feel the same? ♫</i>

132
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:43,036
<i>♫ Are you sure it's a good idea to keep it to yourself? ♫</i>

133
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:46,426
Well, how sweet are you two.

134
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:50,406
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

135
00:12:50,406 --> 00:12:54,146
If I did, I wouldn't have heard
such a good conversation.

136
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:09,286
What do you really want?

137
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:14,816
What do you think I'm going to do?

138
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:22,866
We agreed to end it.

139
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:28,326
Can't I change my mind?

140
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:34,734
You did by having a secretary when you never wanted one before.

141
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,166
But you don't love me.

142
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,146
You're right.

143
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:46,386
I don't love you.

144
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,206
You don't have to wear clothes, you know?

145
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,686
I've seen every part of your body.

146
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:58,412
There's no need to be embarrassed.

147
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:04,146
You are mine.

148
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:08,226
I will never let anyone take you from me.

149
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:25,606
If you don't want that girl to know about your past, just do what I say.

150
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:32,356
Think about it and see what you should do.

151
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:47,046
Well, well, well.

152
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:51,666
Look who's doing an ikebana flower arrangement now.

153
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,976
Who are you giving it to?

154
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:58,559
I'm going to put it in Boss' room.

155
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,976
It's quite empty, so I figured I should add some freshness to it.

156
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:04,816
Is that so?

157
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,946
What? I'm just doing my job.

158
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:08,586
- Really?
- Yes.

159
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:11,586
What a cheerful bunch you are.

160
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:16,456
Have you guys heard about the new COO from Japan?

161
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,526
What? The parent company sent one?

162
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:24,766
But our Boss has been doing everything by himself as CEO.

163
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:26,867
There's no need for the COO.

164
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:29,596
That was before. I saw the documents.

165
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:35,146
This new COO will be restructuring and reshuffling some roles.

166
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:37,996
There will be a reshuffling?

167
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:39,546
Will I be affected?

168
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:41,136
This is giving me goosebumps.

169
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:42,956
I don't think the interpreter team will be affected that much.

170
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:48,446
But the management might because this COO is no ordinary woman.

171
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:50,649
You guys probably know her.

172
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:56,026
I have to go.

173
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:58,026
Okay.

174
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:23,426
It's been a while, Ms. Noom Nim.

175
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,550
ㅤ

176
00:16:29,546 --> 00:16:32,836
Hello, Ms. Rena.

177
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:35,146
You've probably heard about my new role.

178
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:39,186
I look forward to working with you.

179
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:42,826
Likewise.

180
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:52,026
So, we should continue our discussion in your office and finish it by noon.

181
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:54,784
Then we can call a board meeting this afternoon.

182
00:16:55,903 --> 00:17:00,866
Bring me a decaf coffee, but buy it, don't make it.

183
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:04,066
You make horrible coffee.

184
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,646
Let's go.

185
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,106
What you proposed is interesting.

186
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:29,036
If it doesn't affect his regular work, I will transfer him.

187
00:17:29,036 --> 00:17:32,636
But if we can't find him a new role, we'll discuss it again.

188
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,606
Okay.

189
00:17:34,606 --> 00:17:38,676
I'm hungry. Can you take me to a good restaurant?

190
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:42,386
Ms. Noom Nim,

191
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:45,375
is something wrong?

192
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:47,896
No.

193
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:53,456
I just want to let you know you have a budget approval document to sign.

194
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:59,049
Put it on my desk and tell everyone I'm busy and not taking any meetings today.

195
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,016
Okay.

196
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:09,306
What did they say?

197
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:12,036
Why did they look so serious?

198
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:16,786
I have no idea.

199
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:36,176
The PR department went way over budget but did not meet the target.

200
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:38,236
Please consider what you've done.

201
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:43,016
The HR department, why do people stay for less than two months, making the turnover rate so high?

202
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:45,186
Find an answer to that.

203
00:18:45,186 --> 00:18:46,926
Next, the interpreter department.

204
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:51,026
Mr. Ton, I received a report from Ms. Ploy that you guys are overloaded with work.

205
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:55,586
Yes. We have many documents to translate now as it is near the quarter's end

206
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:58,046
and we have to pitch new projects to clients.

207
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:02,986
As we don't have enough people, each of us has to take in a lot of work.

208
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:05,546
Have you submitted a request to hire new interpreters?

209
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:07,676
I have raised it since the beginning of the year.

210
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:11,790
And the company did hire a new person, but

211
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,826
she got transferred to another role.

212
00:19:16,826 --> 00:19:21,936
So it was you who left your team members with workload and became a secretary.

213
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:26,786
Let me tell you all this.

214
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:31,376
The main problem that keeps an organization from running smoothly

215
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:35,326
is when employees' jobs and skills don't match.

216
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:40,956
If you're talking about Nim's performance as a secretary, she's received an excellent review after her probation.

217
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:42,286
As far as I can see...

218
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:45,296
Stop talking! I didn't ask for your opinion.

219
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:47,776
You may perform well as a secretary,

220
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:52,706
but what I'm saying is we hired you to be our interpreter

221
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:56,086
because we needed someone in that department, but you fled your responsibilities for another role.

222
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:59,536
You left your old team with twice the workload.

223
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:04,066
If possible, I'd like Noom Nim back in the interpreter department.

224
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:06,786
Otherwise, I will submit another requirement for a new employee.

225
00:20:06,786 --> 00:20:12,960
That's not necessary. I think what we should do is transferring Ms. Nim back to her old department.

226
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,446
It will make work flow and it will better than spending time hiring a new employee who we can't be sure of.

227
00:20:19,446 --> 00:20:25,986
It's up to you now whether you want to transfer back and help or leave the others struggling.

228
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:30,896
Ms. Rena, Ms. Noom Nim is my secretary.

229
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:36,736
Finding a new secretary
will make my work harder as well.

230
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,096
I'll give you the same answer.

231
00:20:40,096 --> 00:20:45,536
Are you going to have it easy alone and leave the whole other department struggling?

232
00:20:46,386 --> 00:20:49,696
I'm willing to transfer back to the interpreter department.

233
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:52,996
I'm an employee of this company.

234
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:58,006
Whatever makes our work good and go smoothly,

235
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,926
I'm willing to do it, no matter what role I'm in.

236
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,426
Good. At least you're not selfish.

237
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:07,096
I'll find a new secretary as soon as possible.

238
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:09,796
No.

239
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:11,946
I can do it myself.

240
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:29,499
Please translate this document. It's urgent.

241
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:31,146
You got it.

242
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:46,046
Have you finished translating the event script for the creative team? They are chasing us.

243
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:47,959
Almost there.

244
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:03,366
Is the event script ready? Why are you so slow today?

245
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:07,806
I'm doing another check and waiting for the other half from Ting.

246
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:10,339
When you're done, send it to the creative and the event team.

247
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:13,539
Also send it to me and CC the manager.

248
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:15,246
You got it.

249
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,039
You got it.

250
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:25,639
What? I haven't said anything.

251
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:31,626
Do you need anything?

252
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:34,124
Yes. Please take care of this for me.

253
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:40,736
Please wait. I have so much to do right now.

254
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:44,019
No. It's urgent.

255
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:46,826
Open it now.

256
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:48,496
Okay.

257
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:54,946
Pick it up. It's important.

258
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,416
[Keep at it!]

259
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:18,206
Okay!

260
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:20,541
Are you going to punch me?

261
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,019
No.

262
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:24,529
Hurry up and finish your work.

263
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,496
Okay.

264
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:48,369
Mr. Koji will be back soon. I must hurry.

265
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,036
Wine would be a great addition.

266
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:46,846
I'm back.

267
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,356
Aren't you happy to see me? I'm back.

268
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:03,668
Is something the matter?

269
00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:10,306
I want to talk to you about something.

270
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:25,316
Whose lipstick is on the glass?

271
00:25:38,926 --> 00:25:41,166
It's Ms. Rena's, isn't it?

272
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:52,346
Yes.

273
00:25:57,536 --> 00:26:00,010
That's all I wanted to know.

274
00:26:00,773 --> 00:26:02,406
Wait.

275
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:04,906
Sit down.

276
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:37,106
It's nothing.

277
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:42,996
She came to my room and we talked about work.

278
00:26:42,996 --> 00:26:44,846
That's it.

279
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,965
There's nothing between her and me.

280
00:26:58,496 --> 00:27:00,696
You have to trust me.

281
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,616
There's only you in my heart, Nezumi.

282
00:27:19,696 --> 00:27:24,036
Otherwise, I wouldn't have given you a key to my room.

283
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:30,476
Please believe me.

284
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,976
There's really only you.

285
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:45,603
You are my only woman.

286
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,819
Then don't let anyone else come to this room again.

287
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,428
Just like how you don't like me being with someone else,

288
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,956
I don't like you being with someone else.

289
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:18,726
Okay.

290
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,166
I promise.

291
00:28:43,594 --> 00:28:45,674
Are you still mad?

292
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:53,966
No, I'm just tired.

293
00:29:00,346 --> 00:29:02,146
I understand.

294
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:08,590
Since the restructuring started, we've both been busy.

295
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,496
Tomorrow is Saturday. I don't have anything scheduled.

296
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:19,334
Let's go on a date.

297
00:29:25,116 --> 00:29:26,419
Really?

298
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:28,119
Yes.

299
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:44,386
Coming.

300
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:47,280
Are you hungry?

301
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:51,326
Normally you don't put colors on your face,

302
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:55,086
but today you dressed up beautifully to go on a date.

303
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:57,036
- Beautifully?
- Yes.

304
00:29:57,036 --> 00:29:58,306
You talk too much. Just eat.

305
00:29:58,306 --> 00:30:00,745
No. I'm on a diet.

306
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:03,719
Don't let me see you eat.

307
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,586
You won't. I'll drink my coffee.

308
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:09,006
I don't need to eat much in the morning.

309
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:10,586
Whatever.

310
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:13,826
When will you be back?

311
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:18,906
I will sharpen my knife while waiting.

312
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:21,986
Why are you sharpening your knife?

313
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,966
Are you going to help me cook?

314
00:30:23,966 --> 00:30:29,359
Oh, Mom. We don't cook anymore.

315
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,729
We make someone else cook for us.

316
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,980
Anyway, I just

317
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:40,740
want to do a quality check to see if he's really as good as she claimed.

318
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:41,886
Hey.

319
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:46,646
When someone is good, you don't have to do a check on him.

320
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:51,906
I'd say there's a certain QC-rejected person around here that deserves to be taken out more than him.

321
00:30:51,906 --> 00:30:53,219
You're right, Mom.

322
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:57,409
I don't know why I'm keeping you.

323
00:30:57,409 --> 00:30:59,806
Aren't you a little protective of your daughter, Mom?

324
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:01,840
But it's fine.

325
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,380
If Mom doesn't, I won't either. How about that?

326
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,139
Stop talking. Hurry up and finish eating so you can drop your sister off.

327
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:10,939
Alright.

328
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:28,472
Have you been waiting long?

329
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:37,750
Very long.

330
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,360
Why did you keep me waiting for so long?

331
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,636
Really? How should I make it up to you?

332
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:50,106
Okay, first, take me to a movie...

333
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:54,446
and buy me lots of popcorn.

334
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,046
Okay.

335
00:31:56,976 --> 00:32:00,386
Take me to a good waffle place, too.

336
00:32:01,306 --> 00:32:03,206
That's not all.

337
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:09,026
For a whole day today, you have to hold my hand.

338
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:25,040
That's it? My girlfriend is not hard to please at all.

339
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:27,806
Let's go.

340
00:32:42,415 --> 00:32:44,385
What are you laughing about?

341
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:48,080
A certain girl around here.

342
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,216
I told her to pick another movie, but she wouldn't listen,

343
00:32:51,216 --> 00:32:54,288
even though she's afraid of ghosts.

344
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:56,236
Well, I wanted to watch this one.

345
00:32:56,236 --> 00:33:02,369
It's a continuation of the universe. If you watch one, you have to watch all the rest.

346
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,106
You're afraid but still watching it.

347
00:33:06,106 --> 00:33:07,706
It's weird.

348
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:10,676
It's not.

349
00:33:10,676 --> 00:33:13,986
Because I'm afraid, I'm watching it to stop being so.

350
00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:18,116
Ancient people say we have to fight fear with fear.

351
00:33:18,116 --> 00:33:20,626
What does that mean?

352
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:23,366
Forget it. It's nothing.

353
00:33:35,996 --> 00:33:39,826
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

354
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:49,086
<i>♫ Do you think you're the only one who feels this way? ♫</i>

355
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:53,066
<i>♫ Do you think I don't feel the same? ♫</i>

356
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:55,439
What are you doing?

357
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:57,056
Comforting a frightened girl.

358
00:33:57,056 --> 00:34:04,696
<i>♫ Are you sure it's a good idea to keep it to yourself? ♫</i>

359
00:34:13,216 --> 00:34:15,152
This is the place.

360
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:18,246
Is this place very good?

361
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:21,996
Yes. I've been here before. I think you'll like it.

362
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:25,896
They make great waffles and parfaits.

363
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:29,526
Whatever you want, Nezumi.

364
00:34:30,506 --> 00:34:32,106
Okay.

365
00:34:32,106 --> 00:34:34,926
- A table for two, please.
- Please come in.

366
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:44,829
Here's our menu.

367
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:46,816
Thank you.

368
00:35:10,386 --> 00:35:12,086
Hello.

369
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:18,149
Would you like to order something?

370
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:29,886
I'll be right back.

371
00:35:29,886 --> 00:35:32,646
I have to take this call.

372
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:34,109
Wait here.

373
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:35,709
Okay.

374
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:24,356
Sorry. That was a long discussion about work.

375
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:27,636
Have you ordered anything for me?

376
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:31,186
Not yet.

377
00:36:31,186 --> 00:36:32,786
Okay,

378
00:36:33,696 --> 00:36:36,746
I'll let you order for me now.

379
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:39,416
I trust you.

380
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,546
Okay.

381
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:49,166
Nezumi.

382
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,726
Yes?

383
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:58,546
About the dinner with your mom this evening.

384
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,856
You can't make it?

385
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,406
I need to take care of something.

386
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,166
I'm sorry.

387
00:37:15,886 --> 00:37:18,029
It's okay.

388
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,926
My mom is free every day.

389
00:37:22,926 --> 00:37:25,306
You can have dinner with her whenever you want.

390
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:30,116
I'm sorry.

391
00:37:35,346 --> 00:37:37,585
It's urgent.

392
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:42,619
I understand. Don't worry. Let's order something to eat.

393
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,196
I'm sorry.

394
00:37:51,196 --> 00:37:53,856
Please apologize to your mom for me.

395
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:56,476
I will.

396
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:58,990
You should hurry or you'll be late.

397
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:02,226
I'll go then.

398
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:05,066
Okay.

399
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,413
Drive safe. I hope everything goes well.

400
00:38:22,863 --> 00:38:25,246
I'll call you when I get home.

401
00:38:25,246 --> 00:38:26,846
Okay.

402
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:20,286
I'm having a thank you party celebrating the success of our campaign,

403
00:39:20,286 --> 00:39:24,076
so I would like to invite you to join.

404
00:39:24,076 --> 00:39:27,086
Hey, that's Boss for real. He's here with Ms. Rena.

405
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:29,116
It seems that the rumor is true.

406
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,816
What rumor?

407
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,776
About Boss and Ms. Rena.

408
00:39:33,776 --> 00:39:35,676
Hey!
