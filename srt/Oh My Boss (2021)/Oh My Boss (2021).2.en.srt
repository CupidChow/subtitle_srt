00:00:00,386 --> 00:00:03,426
<i>I'm Akitsuki Koji. It's nice to meet you.</i>

2
00:00:03,426 --> 00:00:06,600
<i>I can help make you have a good time.</i>

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,280
<i>You must meet our boss... However, I'll let you know in advance that our boss is very handsome.</i>

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,910
<i>Don't fall for him.</i>

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,560
‎<i>[Boss, Please Don't Flirt | Oh My Boss]</i>

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,070
‎♫ <i>Do you think you're the only one who feels this way</i> ♫

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,130
‎♫ <i>What you feel in your heart</i> ♫

8
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:48,300
‎♫ <i>Do you think that I don't feel the same</i> ♫

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,190
‎♫ <i>Is it okay to only think like that</i> ♫

10
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,190
‎♫ <i>Why are you keeping it to yourself</i> ♫

11
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:04,220
‎♫ <i>Tell me what you're thinking, no need to wait</i> ♫

12
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:14,070
‎♫ <i>I can't see clearly if you love me or if you're just lonely</i> ♫

13
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,100
<i>Does he remember me?</i>

14
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,762
According to the brief from Khun Mark,

15
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:33,393
the product is a matcha biscuit which will be launched in this summer.

16
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,155
<i>He probably doesn't.</i>

17
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,646
<i>Or does he?</i>

18
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:44,586
Translate it.

19
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:56,013
According to the brief from Khun Mark, the product is a matcha biscuit

20
00:01:56,013 --> 00:02:00,140
which will be launched this summer.

21
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,233
So we've come up with an idea for launching a TVC that emphasizes...

22
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:09,506
<i>Get it together! Does he remember me?</i>

23
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:13,189
And how suitable matcha is as a gift for the elderly,

24
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:16,403
especially the elders who love matcha.

25
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,320
That's what Khun Mark requires.

26
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,773
Kamei said he's going to create a TV commercial about how matcha green tea

27
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:36,260
is a great souvenir for the elderly who need to take care of their health.

28
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,406
But I have a supplemental idea.

29
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:43,933
Truth is, if we market this product as just something for the elderly, we're limiting our customer base significantly.

30
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:48,046
So let's expand the audience to include both teenagers and young working professionals.

31
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:52,626
These days, every age group is extremely health conscious, so we can use that to our advantage.

32
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:57,023
Let's make an advertisement that focuses on the health benefits of your product.

33
00:02:57,023 --> 00:02:58,730
Translate that.

34
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,569
Okay. Marketing it as just a souvenir for the elderly...

35
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,966
If we also include teenagers and working professionals, our target group will expand.

36
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:14,046
Presenting the benefits of green tea will likely make them happier.

37
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:16,780
Let's go with that.

38
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,803
You're so smart, Khun Koji.

39
00:03:18,803 --> 00:03:21,483
Khun Mark will love this idea.

40
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,016
The new interpreter is Noom Nim. Today is her first day.

41
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:35,200
Ask her to come to my office.

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,966
You heard that.

43
00:03:57,277 --> 00:03:59,106
My name is Akitsuki Koji.

44
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,813
You can call me Boss, like everyone does.

45
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:04,060
Our company is like a family.

46
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,536
We're not very strict, but you have to be responsible for your work.

47
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,760
The HR department has probably talked to you about our rules.

48
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,030
Here is your employment contract.

49
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:25,886
Do you have any questions?

50
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,806
I do not.

51
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,113
Thank you.

52
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,340
Don't make me wait next time.

53
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,520
I mean, when you translate during the meeting,

54
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,629
you should do it faster,

55
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:58,503
instead of making me wait and having me solve your problem.

56
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:01,400
That's all. You can go.

57
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,409
I sent you some files on Chat-Work.

58
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:21,050
Please complete the translation by today.

59
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:23,573
Okay.

60
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,386
Twenty files?

61
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,220
You're good at it anyway.

62
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,920
Also, the files are rather small.

63
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,580
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

64
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,689
I just sent you three more files.

65
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:46,743
Once you're done translating them, please send them back to me.

66
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,553
Noom Nim, have you finished?

67
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:06,020
Not yet. I have about six pages left to translate.

68
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,820
I can do the rest then.

69
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,890
But let me call my mom and let her know that I can't make it to dinner.

70
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,873
No, it's okay. Once I'm done, I'll send them to you.

71
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:19,093
Are you sure?

72
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:22,570
Yes. Your mom is waiting.

73
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,820
You should go.

74
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,720
Thank you.

75
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:31,246
Bye.

76
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,586
<i>Hey. Let's go to Izakaya tonight. There's a beer buffet today.</i>

77
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,646
<i>I'm down! I want to get wasted!</i>

78
00:07:01,646 --> 00:07:04,746
<i>What time do you get off work, Nim? Do you want to go with me?</i>

79
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,873
<i>I can't tonight. My work is not done.</i>

80
00:07:09,873 --> 00:07:11,773
<i>Seriously? But it's your first day.</i>

81
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:14,633
<i>Why is there so much work to do?</i>

82
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:18,566
<i>I feel like I'm being bullied as a new employee.</i>

83
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:22,360
<i>Why? Is your boss very intimidating?</i>

84
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,109
<i>That's another story. Do you know who my boss is?</i>

85
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:29,473
<i>Who? Is he handsome?</i>

86
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:33,129
<i>Take a photo of him and send me! I want to see!</i>

87
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,366
<i>Talk to you guys later. I have to work.</i>

88
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:56,640
Is the work load too much?

89
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,710
No. I'm just slow at translating.

90
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,920
There are some words I don't understand the meaning of.

91
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,566
Okay. Ask me what you don't understand.

92
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,769
It's okay. I can try to figure it out myself.

93
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:16,249
Don't you get it?

94
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:19,710
If you're slow at translating, I have to leave the office late too.

95
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:45,126
Go ahead and translate.

96
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,460
Okay.

97
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,750
‎Because...

98
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,393
What other words?

99
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:09,046
Why are you staring at my face?

100
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:11,073
What other words are there?

101
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:13,990
- The word... This one right here.
- Oh.

102
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,980
Desideratum.

103
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,933
This word in this sentence means something important,

104
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:23,973
something that is wanted,

105
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,255
something you can't live without.

106
00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:35,310
‎♫ <i>Do you think you're the only one who feels this way</i> ♫

112
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,296
Thank you. If it weren't for your help, it would have taken me another hour to translate.

113
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:09,786
Your job is my job.

114
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:11,913
I'm driving you home. Let's go.

115

Pardon?

116
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,000
I said I'm driving you home.

117
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,740
It's okay. I'll take the Skytrain.

118
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,813
You sure like to talk back.

119
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,660

Thank you.

128
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,293
He really doesn't remember me.

129
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:09,286
That's why they say, "don't fall in love with someone in a bar."

130
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,433
<i>Do you guys think it's possible not to remember someone you kissed?</i>

131
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:21,073
<i>[Poppy] No way! Of course, you'd remember who you kissed.</i>

132
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:23,973
<i>[Meow] Don't tell me you saw that man from the bar.</i>

133
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:25,910
<i>Yes!</i>

134
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,780
<i>That man from the bar is now my boss!</i>

135
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,533
<i>He seemed indifferent and didn't say anything about that night.</i>

136
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:40,153
<i>He didn't even mention or remember anything. What does it mean?</i>

137
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:44,380
<i>[Pinn] Basically, you have nothing worth remembering, plain jane.</i>

138
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,553
<i>You're horrible!</i>

139
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:59,646
<i>Let's guess each other's outfit.</i>

140
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:01,660
I'll go first.

141
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,533
I want to drink blood!

142
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,153
- An ogre?
- Annabelle.

143
00:12:07,153 --> 00:12:08,313
Guess my outfit.

144
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:10,113
A crow?

145
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:12,873
- Are crows in your area red?
- Lady Gaga.

146
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:15,926
Right. You know nothing. What's your outfit?

147
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:17,606
Ang Ang Ang.

148
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:19,606
Angsumalin?
<i>(T/N: The leading lady in the Thai Novel, Khu Kam)</i>

149
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,933
Shizu...

150
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:22,653
A Shih Tzu dog?

151
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,153
What about you, Noom Nim?

152
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:30,420
Have you thought about what to wear for the nomikai party tonight?

153
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,100
Enough with showing off the outfits.

154
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,920
If your work is not done, you might not get to go.

155
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:44,733
The Japan office has sent more files. Please finish your translation today.

156
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:48,876
But I haven't finished the other files yet.

157
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:53,093
Then you must hurry or you won't get to the party in time.

158
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:56,820
You're brilliant, right?

00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,440
This is good work, as I instructed,

160
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,389
but I don't think the newbie is finished yet.

161
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,376
She won't be able to join us tonight. By the time she finishes, the party will be over.

162
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,000
How is your translation coming along?

163
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,860
Are you close? Will you be able to finish in time?

164
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,280
I've already sent the files to your email.

165
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:49,903
Little Mermaid. Little Mermaid.

166
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:51,360
Okay.

167
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,960
How is it going?

168
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,710
Is the translation of the price quote and Khun Mark's company's schedule ready?

169
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,546
I've already sent them to you on Chat-Work.

170
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,260
Oh, okay.

171
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,913
Great. You worked efficiently.

172
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:05,573
Your translation was good as well.

173
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:09,880
Thank you. P'Ton, you know that I have high standards for work.

174
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,186
Since there is time left until the party, you can clear some more work.

175
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:18,726
- Here are two marketing files for Khun Mark's company to translate. Can it be done in time?
- Of course.

176
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:21,416
- Okay. I'll let you take care of it.
- Sure.

177
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,580
You heard that, right?

178
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,170
You can translate only one folder for now. The other one is not urgent.

179
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:35,240
If you're worried you won't finish in time, just overwrite the old files.

180
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,493
He complimented the quality of our work, so keep up the standard.

181
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:40,860
Of course.

182
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,046
I'll do my best.

183
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,350
‎<i>‎[The beginning]
[Immediately]</i>

184
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,503
Let's go grab some food. You can take a break.

185
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,549
You guys go ahead. I need to finish this in time.

186
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:20,856
P'Ploy made you do it, right?

187
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:23,820
It's my responsibility.

188
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,246
Don't worry. Look.

189
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,640
I brought my lunch.

190
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,193
Nong Nim, why are you being such a good girl?

191
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:39,393
You make us look like villains.

192
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:43,693
We're going to lunch then.

193
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,193
Okay.

194
00:15:57,553 --> 00:16:00,380
You don't have to pressure yourself.

195
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,606
The work is urgent, though.

196
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:08,526
Then consider this as an order.

197
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,867
Boss.

198
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:16,266
There's something I need you to do immediately.

199
00:16:26,706 --> 00:16:29,700
But my work is urgent.

200
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,920
I'm worried about your work, so I'm making you do this.

201
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,540
If you don't eat, you can't give your 100%.

202
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,066
You don't have to worry about that.

203
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:07,893
I worry about every one of my employees.

204
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,713
Now close your laptop.

205
00:17:11,713 --> 00:17:13,580
This is an order.

206
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:40,686
<i>[Eat.]</i>

207
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,140
<i>[Nim: These are the price quote and Khun Mark's company's schedule.]
[Ploy: Okay.]</i>

208
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,273
I've finished the translation. I just sent it to your email.

209
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,549
That's good. I hope you can keep up the standard.

210
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:00,780
Why did I receive only one file? I asked you to work on two files.

211
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,153
- Did you not translate both of the files?
- But you...

212
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:07,386
I sent her two files and told her the deadline in the group chat.

213
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,546
If you don't believe me, read the chat.

214
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,606
Noom Nim, if you can't finish your work in time, you should tell me earlier on.

215
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:20,113
I understand you want to take on many things to show off, but you also must meet the deadlines.

216
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:24,568
But you told me I could finish one file first and do the other one later.

217
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:28,148
You made a mistake, and now you're blaming me?

218
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,160
Do you still have the backup file?

219
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,540
I overwrote it with my translation.

220
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,946
You're working for a company, not doing a class presentation.

221
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:48,920
This is why I don't want new employees.

222
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,706
I'll get the backup file from another team.

223
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:54,626
I'm sorry for the mistake.

224
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:56,900
I'll fix everything by today.

225
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,973
At least you're taking responsibility.

226
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,470
Apologize to the planning team as well.

227
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,633
Action.

228
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,533
You shouldn't have to go through this.

229
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,780
I told you P'Ploy is a snake.

230
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,753
It's okay. Have fun for me.

231
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,560
Let's go.

232
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,440
Gagagagagaga.

233
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,480
Gagagagagaga.

234
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,666
Aren't you leaving yet?

235
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,506
Not yet.

236
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:29,693
Make one for me.

237
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,100
Okay.

238
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,586
Bring it to my room.

239
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,713
It tastes bitter.

240
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,620
Really?

241
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,273
How much sugar do you want? I'll make you a new cup.

242
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:18,820
There's no need. It's fine.

243
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,980
Everyone else is at the party.

244
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,293
What are you still doing here?

245
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:35,660
P'Ploy asked me to translate the plans for Khun Mark and the simulation.

246
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,874
I've only finished one.

247
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:42,921
Did she just tell you there were two files?

248
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,180
I was careless.

249
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,890
Do you realize you won't make it to the nomikai party?

250
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,140
To me,

251
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,440
the nomikai party is just as important.

252
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,103
I don't want to have fun when I still have work to finish

253
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:05,683
and have to send it to other people.

254
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:08,406
I don't want to keep them waiting.

255
00:22:08,406 --> 00:22:10,140
I want to finish it first.

256
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,610
Turn off your computer and get ready.

257
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,993
I haven't finished my work.

258
00:22:15,993 --> 00:22:19,470
Don't you feel uncomfortable

259
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,920
making your boss wait?

260
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,900
We work and play hard here.

261
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,570
But I have to submit my work tonight.

262
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,240
<i>Doraemon!</i>

263
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:58,186
- Nong Noom Nim, have you finished your work?
- Not yet.

264
00:22:58,186 --> 00:23:01,546
We have to submit it to the client tomorrow. I shouldn't have trusted a newbie like you.

265
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,566
I can't believe young people these days are like this. How irresponsible.

266
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:07,706
Never mind getting full-time employment, who knows if you'll pass your probation.

267
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:11,360
Can you take responsibility if the work due tomorrow suffers a loss?

268
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,043
Yes.

269
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,406
I will take responsibility. I've talked to the client.

270
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:20,293
I'm sorry I made you feel distressed.

271
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:22,480
I'm not blaming you, Boss.

272
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,860
This is not your responsibility.

273
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,314
Nong Noom Nim should complete all her work by the deadlines.

274
00:23:30,314 --> 00:23:35,780
With that much workload, even the two of you helping each other can't finish on time.

275
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,160
I'm sorry. I won't let it happen again.

276
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,860
I'm sorry.

277
00:23:51,757 --> 00:23:54,513
Noom Nim, let's get you dressed up.

278
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:57,010
Please excuse us, Boss.

279
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:01,500
Go on. Why are you looking at me?

280
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,040
Okay.

281
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,910
Hey, Boss.

282
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,806
Why aren't you dressed up?

283
00:24:12,806 --> 00:24:16,153
We're all dressed up.

284
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:20,006
It's not fair.

285
00:24:20,006 --> 00:24:22,206
It's not time yet.

286
00:24:24,786 --> 00:24:27,206
It's so flowy. You look gorgeous.

287
00:24:27,206 --> 00:24:28,713
I want to wear it, too.

288
00:24:28,713 --> 00:24:30,860
I want a crown, too.

289
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,466
Wow!

290
00:24:32,466 --> 00:24:34,420
Are you dressed as Elsa?

291
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,953
<i>Cinderella!</i>

292
00:24:35,953 --> 00:24:37,573
Oh, right.

293
00:24:37,573 --> 00:24:40,673
Come on, get your food, Cinderella.

294
00:24:40,673 --> 00:24:44,820
If you don't eat before midnight, your evil stepmother will hit you.

295
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,733
Luckily, the prince saved her just now.

296
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:54,230
Did you see how Stepmother Ploy turned pale and embarrassed?

297
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,413
Serves her right for treating others like servants.

298
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,826
Don't do it, Khun Ploy. Let them talk.

299
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:07,709
You know what you're doing.

300
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,676
Let's eat.

301
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,813
Everyone, listen up.

302
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,513
Put your glasses down.

303
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:18,140
Come here! Come, come!

304
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,080
We have a surprise for you tonight.

305
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,400
Put your glasses down! Come, come!

306
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,593
Let's have fun together.

307
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,513
You all haven't seen our boss dressed up, correct?

308
00:25:35,513 --> 00:25:36,926
<i>Yes!</i>

309
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:39,620
- Do you want to see him?
<i>- Yes.</i>

310
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,700
Make some noise if you want to see him.

311
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,526
Okay, I'm going to ask Khun Koji to come up.

312
00:25:51,526 --> 00:25:54,593
Three, two, one.

313
00:25:54,593 --> 00:25:57,806
Please come up.

314
00:26:12,953 --> 00:26:17,033
♫ <i>Let me touch your heart and see how fast it's beating</i> ♫

315
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:20,553
♫ <i>You come and make my heart skip a beat like this</i> ♫

316
00:26:20,553 --> 00:26:25,593
♫ <i>I think you're feeling it too, right?</i> ♫

317
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:29,406
♫ <i>My heart is pounding the rhythm of love</i> ♫

318
00:26:29,406 --> 00:26:33,013
<i>♫ What's the rhythm of your heart? ♫</i>

319
00:26:33,013 --> 00:26:37,426
♫ <i>Why do you have to be shy? I just want to know your rhythm</i> ♫
♫ <i>Can I feel it? I just want to touch your rhythm</i> ♫

320
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:39,633
♫ <i>Don't you know I want to. Do you think the same way?</i> ♫

321
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:42,993
♫ <i>Can you send a signal?</i> ♫

322
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:11,293
As you all know, Nim-san is a new employee of our company.

323
00:27:11,293 --> 00:27:14,700
This is her first nomikai party with us,

324
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,560
and she almost couldn't make it.

325
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,513
Why?

326
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,680
I haven't finished my work.

327
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,220
Right.

328
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,304
That work is supposed to be submitted to the client tomorrow morning.

329
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:35,510
But from what I saw, even if she worked all night, she wouldn't be able to complete it.

330
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:48,966
I'll get back to it right away.

331
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,966
There's no need.

332
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:53,160
On Monday,

333
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,480
you can clear your desk of everything.

334
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,313
You're not right for the translation department anymore.

335
00:28:05,313 --> 00:28:07,893
<i>Aw, Boss...</i>

336
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:09,740
Finally, she's getting fired.

337
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,986
I knew she wouldn't last.

338
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:21,160
You will sit in front of my room instead...

339
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,806
because I'm making you my secretary.

340
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,769
<i>What? His secretary?</i>

341
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:39,775
This position hasn't existed in a long time.

342
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,153
We must celebrate.

343
00:28:43,937 --> 00:28:47,453
Nong Nim will treat us, right?

344
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:52,893
Nim. What's wrong? Aren't you happy?

345
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,990
What's wrong?

346
00:29:05,606 --> 00:29:07,306
Boss,

347
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,660
I need to talk to you.

348
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,113
I can't be your secretary.

349
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,246
I haven't finished the work I've started.

350
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:33,186
I don't want you to make me your secretary because you pity me.

351
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,126
I didn't choose you out of pity.

352
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,020
I chose you out of my need.

353
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,800
What do you want from me?

354
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,440
I want your capability.

355
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,506
I think you have great potential.

356
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,520
What did you think I want?

357
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,460
No, nothing.

358
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:15,800
Let's stop talking about work tonight and have fun.

359
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,180
Here's your drink.

360
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,930
Thank you.

361
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:26,710
Umeshu straight.

362
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,069
For you.

363
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:31,783
I don't drink alcohol.

364
00:30:31,783 --> 00:30:33,540
Really?

365
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,820
I think you do.

366
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,506
Are you going to drink it?

367
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,923
Or do I have to feed you?

368
00:30:51,923 --> 00:30:53,796
No, I'm fine.

369
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,200
This desk is very new.

370
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,720
P'Ploy has been working here for ten years and still hasn't got her own desk.

371
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:28,373
How do you make merit, Noom Nim?

372
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:29,783
Can I get some of your merit?

373
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:31,889
I didn't do anything.

374
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,320
I'm feeling good just by sitting in this chair.

375
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,413
And look at this new MacBook.

376
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,410
Noom Nim-san.

377
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,640
I've put the documents on your desk.

378
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,993
Don't forget to send me your old files.

379
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:54,593
Okay.

380
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,406
Can I help you?

381
00:31:59,406 --> 00:32:01,626
Come into my room.

382
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:06,606
- Okay.
- I arrive at the office at 8 o'clock every morning,

383
00:32:06,606 --> 00:32:12,346
so you have to get here at 7 a.m. to prepare my schedule.

384
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:15,680
These are the client folders.

385
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,313
You have to memorize everything inside and help me when you accompany me to events.

386
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,273
In the afternoon, you must prepare snacks for me.

387
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:28,060
Also, I do not drink those 3-in-1 instant coffees.

388
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,126
Can you remember all that?

389
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,166
Yes.

390
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,840
Please repeat what I said.

391
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,800
I'm sorry.

392
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,310
Can you go over it one more time?

393
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,300
I'm not like Khun Ploy.

394
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,900
If you do a good job,

395
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,810
you'll be rewarded;

396
00:32:53,813 --> 00:32:57,007
but if you make a mistake,

397
00:32:57,007 --> 00:32:59,506
you'll get punished.

398
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,723
I'm done talking. Why are you still here?

399
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,920
Please excuse me.

400
00:33:21,657 --> 00:33:27,100
Nong Noom Nim, this is the material for the boss to pick a model.

401
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,080
I want this back as soon as possible.

402
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,960
Three pages?

403
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:34,313
Okay.

404
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,393
<i>[Akitsuki Koji: I'd like a cup of coffee.]</i>

405
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:50,886
Here you go.

406
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,940
Is it still bitter?

407
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,106
I put five teaspoons of sugar in it already.

408
00:34:11,106 --> 00:34:14,066
Any more of it and you'll get diabetes.

409
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,953
I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

410
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:23,570
Wait.

411
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,706
What did you just refer to yourself as?

412
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,590
Nhu.
<i>(T/N: What someone younger refers to themselves; it's more intimate)</i>

413
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:37,240
It's what I call myself when I talk to someone older.

414
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,649
But, Nhu is sorry. Oops!

415
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:44,053
I'm sorry. It's a slip of the tongue.

416
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,330
Just refer to yourself as Nhu per usual. Why change?

417
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:59,606
I can't. No one does that at work. It's unprofessional.

418
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:04,360
Then only do it when you're speaking with me.

419
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,586
I like it. It's cute.

420
00:35:09,613 --> 00:35:11,573
Nhu...

421
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,116
I won't do it. I won't.

422
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,033
Nim-san, please book me a flight to Chiang Mai.

423
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:35,056
I'm going to see the Japanese client.

424
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:37,056
Will do.

425
00:35:41,477 --> 00:35:43,800
Let me know when you send him to the gate.

426
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,100
I will.

427
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,840
He has only two bags.

428
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,370
<i>My boss is going away for several days.</i>

429
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:59,380
<i>Any plans for tonight? Count me in!</i>

430
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,713
Here you go.

431
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:03,580
Get in first.

432
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,580
Pardon? Do you want me to send you to the airport?

433
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,713
"Send"? You have to come along with me.

434
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,113
What?

435
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,690
What?

436
00:36:16,477 --> 00:36:20,893
I'm going to Chiang Mai for work, and you're going with me.

437
00:36:20,893 --> 00:36:25,606
But you didn't tell me I had to go.

438
00:36:25,606 --> 00:36:27,466
I changed my mind.

439
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:33,980
I thought about it and realized...

440
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,920
I'm going there for work, not for vacation

441
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,670
so if I go without my secretary,

442
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,390
why do I even have one?

443
00:36:44,393 --> 00:36:46,040
Okay.

444
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,960
Get in. We'll find you a ticket at the airport.

445
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,050
I don't want to miss my flight.

446
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,146
Come on. Hurry.

447
00:36:56,146 --> 00:36:57,646
