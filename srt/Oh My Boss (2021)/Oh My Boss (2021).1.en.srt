00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,520
Thank you.

17
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,310
That's super adorable!

18

Excuse me, I would like to take this one.

Can't you act like you're enjoying yourself?

You were accepted at the first place you interviewed for.

Tell me what's so good about you.

I guess they see my talent.

Which company again?

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,220
- ViperX.
- Oh...

33
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,300
That Japanese advertising company? I'm not interested then.

34
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,020
Why not?

35
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,810
I'm more into Western guys.

36
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,681
That's great. Then you won't be competing against Noom Nim and me.

Hey, I've been here several times.

I'm telling you now that Japanese guys here are so hot, we must look stunning tonight.

39
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,800
I won't disagree with that.

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,660
But... you can't just look beautiful and be unfriendly, Nim.

41
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,320
Please make yourself look more approachable to guys.

42
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,960
Then what should I do? I don't know how to.

43
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,660
So tonight, to get rid of your innocence, you must be freaking hot.

44
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,180
Start by taking off your hoodie.

45
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,230
No, I don't want to. If I get cold, I can just...

46
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,450
Can just what? No need to.

47
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,280
I know you're dressed to the fullest. Why hide it? Take it off.

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,580
- Take if off now.
- Come on.

49
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,341
- Come here.
- Don't resist!

- Stunning!
- You've got it.

See? You look great.

52
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,171
- But you still need to touch up.
- True.

53
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:44,426
Because I still look more beautiful than you do.

54
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,320
What are you doing? Dance rehearsal?

55
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,230
Well, first of all, you must change that makeup pouch.

56
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,590
Chang it now if you want to get one of those hot guys out there.

57
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,640
Let me take a look.

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,250
When you do your makeup, just smack it on.

59
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,941
Put more makeup on. A lot more!

60
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,500
I'll go out and order. Poppy must have gotten the Master by now.

61
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,800
Master? He should be mine!

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,861
Hey, hold on. Wait for me! One sec!

63
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,000
Wait for me first!

You're showing off, aren't you? You drank it all up.

Showing off? She only ordered a mocktail. It's non-alcoholic, as usual.

Was your boss really hitting on you like that?

86
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,520
I'm jealous. I'll make a resume now.

87
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,410
- Why?
- I'm going to apply for a job there.

88
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,581
Everything I said... was a joke.

89

Look at this. Poppy is already fantasizing.

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,580
He's shaking.

93
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,040
I was already imagining things in my head.

94
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,390
I haven't started my job yet.

95
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,210
I'll start next month.

96
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,230
Hold on.

97
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,100
That company is a Japanese advertising agency start-up,

98
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,880
so there must be tons of young guys who are up-and-coming, right?

99
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,720
Unlike my uncle-like boss, aged over 50, at the factory...

100
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,340
Just thinking of that makes me dreadful. I want to resign tomorrow!

101
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,980
Calm down. Why would you resign?

102
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,920
You're getting great welfare and a large salary bonus. Don't resign.

103
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,560
My dream of becoming the beautiful wife of a young Japanese businessman

104
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,930
and moving to Tokyo after that is now even more out of reach.

105
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,410
That's your bad, Pinn!

106
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,340
You bitch!

107
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,167
Hey Nim, tonight you have to get a guy, all right?

108
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:45,200
And don't act awkward in front of the guys like last time.

109
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,590
- That's right.
- There are so many guys here.

110
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,410
Yes! That's a guarantee!

111
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,870
If any guy approaches me tonight,

112
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,180
I'll greet him with, "Welcome!"

113
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,620
Open your arms for him. Perfect.

114
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,000
We must practice our language skills now.

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,740
A gentleman ordered this glass of Sex on the Beach for you.

116
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,710
Yes, you.

117
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,900
Who?

118
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,630
- For her?
- Yes.

119
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,901
- Which guy?
- From which table?

120
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:21,111
That table over there.

121
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,830
That girl can't take her eyes off you.

122
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,810
Pinn! She got one! She got one!

123
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,781
Look at her! How confident she is. I just want to slap her mouth.

124
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:04,340
Let's go, Nim. Let's talk to them at their table.

125
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,640
Wait, wait, wait.

126
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,280
It has nothing to do with me. He ordered this for you only.

127
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,570
Oh, please! Come on.

128
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,390
I saw you staring at his friend. Go with Pinn now. Hurry!

129
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,350
It's obvious you like him.

130
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,010
Yes, you. You can finally get to say "Welcome!"

131
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,410
Hold on! I was talking nonsense.

132
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,400
Go right now. It's the best time. Stand up!

133
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,320
- Hurry!
- I was just saying things randomly!

134
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,800
He looks hot. Just go.

135
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Girl, I'm wearing a skirt.

136
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,620
Just open up your skirt. Go.

137
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,920
Why aren't you helping me at all?

138
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,601
- We are helping you right now.
- Come with me.

139
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,551
Come on!

140
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,750
Are you all right?

141
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,350
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,701
- I'll leave now.
- Wait!

143
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,660
Did you order this glass for me?

144
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,631
Yes. Do you like it?

145
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:30,250
Are you a Japanese?

146
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,940
Can you speak Japanese?

147
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,980
Yes. I'm working as a Japanese interpreter, and so is my friend.

148
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,758
I see.

149

What about your friend?

151
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:51,670
Nim, didn't you hear what he asked? Answer him, or else he'll think that you're being arrogant.

152
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,590
Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Noom Nim.

153
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,690
Wow! Both of you can really speak Japanese.

154
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,000
Amazing!

155
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What does Noom Nim mean?

156
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,230
Well,

157
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,320
it means fluffy and soft.

158
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:20,010
That's why your name really suits you well.

159
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,040
I'm Akitsuki Koji.

160
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,370
It's nice to meet you.

161
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,610
Do you come here to drink often?

162
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,230
Not really. Nim has just got a job offer, so we're here to celebrate.

163
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,760
Congratulations.

164
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,221
- Thank you.
- So should we treat them?

165
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:05,171
All right, Koji?

166
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:11,547
Master, one more set of drinks for this lady, please.

167
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,160
To commemorate our acquaintance.

168
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,161
Sure. We want to get to know you even more.

169
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:24,960
Then I'll go back to them.

170
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,600
That's up to you.

171
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:31,568
Please kindly take care of Pinn.

172
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,140
Are just the two of you here?

173
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,041
Yes. Are you here with other friends, too?

174
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,200
You said that you would sit with your friends, didn't you?

175
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,290
My friends are no longer available now.

176
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,800
How pitiful.

177
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,840
I can chat with you.

178
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:24,920
Is this your first time here?

179
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
Yes,

180
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,700
and I guess it's also my last.

181
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,500
Why?

182
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,220
Are you not enjoying yourself?

183
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,390
I can help make you have a good time.

184
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,780
You can go back and sit with your friends. I can sit alone.

185
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,320
I'd better not.

186
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,890
Why are you laughing?

187
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,040
You...

188
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,990
are the first woman who walks away from me.

189
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,680
This is really interesting.

190
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,280
Well, I'm going to the restroom.

191
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,180
See you then.

192
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,540
<i>Is he interested in me? Me?</i>

193
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,780
<i>It can't be. Impossible.</i>

194
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,920
<i>He was just saying. How could he become interested in me?</i>

195
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,620
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:40,720
Cheers!

197
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,690
Pinn! Pinn! Pinn!

198
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,460
Pinn! Pinn! Pinn! Girl, I'm thrilled!

199
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,790
Guess who I just ran into.

200
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,060
Do you remember my favorite Japanese idol? Miyakawa Azuki.

201
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,720
Miyakawa Azuki?

202
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,020
Where? Where? Where?

203
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,640
Azuki? Azuki? That's impossible.

204
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,800
She's a top idol.

205
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,521
She won't come to this kind of place.

206
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:08,501
He's right.

207
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,080
But I did see her for real.

208
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,070
You saw it wrong.

209
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,950
No! I didn't see wrong. I really did see her.

210
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,690
Come with me, and I'll show you right in front of your face.

211
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,790
Come on!

212
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,751
She's going to leave! You're still trying to drink!

213
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,810
Here. This way.

214
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,810
Oh gosh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

215
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,040
‎Here. Here.

216
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,160
It's around here.

217
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,090
I met Azuki around here.

218
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,260
Where?

219
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,340
She's not here.

220
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,080
You! You saw it wrong.

221
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,360
No, I didn't.

222
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,540
Forget it. Just forget it.

223
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,580
Anyway, I'll go back to my Hazobe.

224
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,480
All right?

225
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,890
End of the story.

226
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,290
I did see her for real.

227
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,500
At first, he acted like he was interested in me.

228
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,260
Flirtatious guys are like this.

229
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,200
You're not taking your eyes off him.

230
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,520
Why?

231
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,970
- Look at him. He's good at his job.
- So annoying!

232
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,400
Where are you going, Nim?

233
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,250
I'm going home.

234
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,340
The bar hasn't closed yet. Don't leave yet.

235
00:18:57,389 --> 00:18:59,650
Well then, head home safely.

236
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,580
See you.

237
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,780
Here, please.

238
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,490
I'll continue playing with men now.

239
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,730
- Did you mean playing snooker?
- That's right.

240
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,100
Hey, P'Aof, where are you?
<i>(T/N: P/Phi, refers to someone older)</i>

241
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,020
- Oops, he's already waiting.
- My friend is playful.

242
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,576
Are you leaving now?

243
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,201
Yes.

244
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,639
Why are you leaving so early?

245
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:25,740
Is it because of what you just saw?

246
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,990
What are you talking about?

247
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,490
About what, huh?

248
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,290
Tell me what you saw,

249
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,620
and I'll let you leave.

250
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,440
Answer me.

251
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,900
I'm waiting for your answer.

252
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,560
You shouldn't have done that.

253
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,360
What did I do?

254
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,880
I don't know who you are,

255
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,840
but I think what you did to Azuki was not right.

256
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,400
You should respect women!

257
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:30,240
Azuki is a disciplined and lovely girl.

258
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,950
She has a bright future ahead.

259
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,020
Her future shouldn't be ruined by meeting someone like you here.

260
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,090
What are you laughing at?

261
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:43,080
Hey, are you Miyakawa-san's fangirl?

262
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,580
It doesn't matter whether I'm a fan or not.

263
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,120
What you did was not appropriate.

264
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,250
I don't want Azuki to get involved in scandals.

265
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,480
You should know that what you did was not a good thing.

266
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,310
Then what would be considered a good thing?

267
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,526
Should it be kissing you...

268
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,244
Is that it?

269
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,648
Noom Nim, you shouldn't have trembled because of a person like him.

270
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,870
Stop being so naive already.

271
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,990
<i>Don't follow me.</i>

272
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,050
<i>Don't follow me!</i>

273
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,220
<i>What's wrong with you? Explain it to me!</i>

274
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,427
<i>Let go of me.</i>

275
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,773
If others or your fans see you here, what will happen?

276
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:47,853
I don't care if they see me here.

277
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:52,066
I won't go back with you. Stop following me!

278
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:54,186
Damn it! I can't take this any more!

279
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:55,993
I'm your manager.

280
00:21:55,993 --> 00:22:00,854
Manager? Having a manager like you, I choose not to have any!

281
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,780
Is that so?

282
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,980
Let's see then.

283
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,350
Between leaving me and letting me release that secret clip of you, which one is easier?

284
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,180
Let's just talk nicely.

285
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,610
Move back!

286
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,490
Azuki-san!

287
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,160
Azuki-san!

288
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,950
I'm your big fan.

289
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,400
I'm so worried about you.

290
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,420
I want to help you.

291
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,680
Azuki-san...

292
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,701
Please help me. Please get me out of here.

293
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:12,110
That manager Ken...

294
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,714
I will never go back with him. Please help me.

295
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:18,121
Please help.

296
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:48,280
Can I have your Line account or any contact channel?

297
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,405
Why do you need it?

298
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:53,840
I recorded this.

299
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,320
I think it will help you someday.

300
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,370
I'll send it to you.

301
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,050
<i>There she is!</i>

302
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,313
She's there!

303
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,940
After her.

304
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,160
<i>‎[Exit]</i>

305
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,940
This way is better.

306
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,820
Thank you very much.

307
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,621
Thanks to both of you.

308
00:25:59,621 --> 00:26:03,221
Without you two, I would have been in trouble.

309
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,320
You should thank her. It's all right for me.

310
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,000
Next time, please do not sneak out like this.

311
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,186
It's dangerous.

312
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:23,666
Staying with him makes my life hell on earth. You already saw that.

313
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,860
I understand.

314
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,220
But to others' eyes, you are still adorable Azuki-san for all the fans.

315
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,050
Your future in the entertainment industry is truly important to me.

316
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:38,080
I'll be careful.

317
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,960
Miyakawa-san,

318
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,240
please contact this person.

319
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,760
He's an experienced lawyer.

320
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,450
Tell him that you got his contact number from me.

321
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,073
He will help you with everything.

322
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,747
Please don't let anyone know that I was here.

323
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,073
If you need any help, please contact me through the Line account I gave you.

324
00:27:12,073 --> 00:27:14,310
Thank you very much.

325
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,730
Let's go back to the bar.

326
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:54,853
So what's the relationship between Azuki-san and you

327
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:57,211
- for you guys to...
- Kiss?

328
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,500
You think I kissed her, right?

329
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,910
That's what you think you saw.

330
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,520
But the truth may not always be what you see.

331
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,360
<i>Please pretend that you're kissing me.</i>

332
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,540
<i>Flirtatious guys are like this.</i>

333
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:37,120
Oh, so she was trying to hide from her manager.

334
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,680
Exactly.

335
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,330
Do you think I'm the kind of person who would easily kiss anyone?

336
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,130
I'm not.

337
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,340
My kiss

338
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,150
is reserved for someone important to me.

339
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,270
Here's umeshu.
<i>(T/N: Umeshu is Japanese plum liqueur.)</i>

340
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,900
Punishment for misunderstanding me.

341
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,140
How is it?

342
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:32,100
It's kind of sweet.

343
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,820
I like something sweet, too.

344
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,530
Noom Nim?

345
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,210
Why are you here alone with Akitsuki-san?

346
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:54,040
Pinn and I have agreed to go to a karaoke nearby.

347
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,660
Noom Nim-san, would you like to join us?

348
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,280
Please excuse me.

349
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,310
Yes, Mom.

350
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,710
<i>What are you doing? Why did you pick up my call so slowly?</i>

351
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,960
It was so loud inside. I didn't hear it.

352
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,480
<i>When are you coming back? It's almost midnight now.</i>

353
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,160
I'm going back soon.

354
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,781
<i>Okay. I'm waiting for you.</i>

355
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:27,360
Yes.

356
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,800
Are you leaving now?

357
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,800
Yes. My mom already called.

358
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,250
Oh no, that's a pity.

359
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,700
- Such a pity.
- You can't come.

360
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,200
How will you go back?

361
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,990
Well, I guess I'll take a taxi.

362
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,580
Please excuse me.

363
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,300
I'm leaving.

364
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,210
I'll drive you home.

365
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,111
After we arrive at the intersection, which direction should I head to next?

366
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,620
Please continue straight. Head straight.

367
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,760
So who do you currently live with?

368
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,940
Right now,

369
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,940
I'm living with my mom and my older brother; the three of us.

370
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,410
Then I guess I can only drop you off in front of your house.

371
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:05,307
That button is broken.

372
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,210
Call me.

373
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:42,250
<i>‎[CEO Akitsuki Koji | ViperX]</i>

374

Gosh! Where did I leave it?

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,590
<i>[I hope to see you again.]</i>

380

<i>[One month later]</i>

381
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,480
<i>Our company uses a chat program called Chat-Work to discuss the work.</i>

382
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,510
You should start by registering an email first. Then create an account in Chat-Work.

383
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:32,870
Our admin will invite you to join the company's group chat.

384
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:37,280
After joining the group, add the seniors and send them a greeting.

385
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,760
Introduce yourself to everyone.

386
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,810
Of course.

387
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:46,060
Here's your staff ID card for clocking in and out.

388
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,870
Use it to open the office door as well.

389
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,110
Thank you.

390
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,960
Don't lose it.

391
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,380
Do you have any questions?

392
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,880
No, I don't.

393
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,560
Okay, I'll show you your office desk.

394
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,760
Hey, Ja Oh. Is she new here?

395
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,190
- Hi there.
- Hello.

396
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,960
Hello.

397
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,290
‎Hello.

398
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:17,830
I want to get to know her, so I'm here to see her face.

399
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,691
She's lovely, but not as lovely as I am.

400
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:24,800
Right. Lovely.

401
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,180
But if your work can also be as good as how you look,

402
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:32,870
your KPI should be leveled up this year.
<i>(T/N: KPI, Key Performance Indicator)</i>

403
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,520
That's too harsh.

404
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,640
Here's your desk. Please keep it clean.

405
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,020
If you have any questions, feel free to ask anytime, or you can ask P'Ploy who's sitting across from you.

406
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,630
<i>‎[ViperX]</i>

407
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,060
Hello.

408
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,300
Hello, P'Ploy. Please kindly take care of me.

409
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,161
Sure.

410
00:36:58,161 --> 00:37:00,720
There's one last thing.

411
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,000
You must meet our boss to introduce yourself and sign the contract,

412
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,640
but he doesn't come in the mornings. You may have to wait a bit.

413
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,420
Oh, the boss?

414
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,370
There's nothing to be scared of. You'll know when you see him.

415
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:20,090
However, I'll let you know in advance that our boss is very handsome.

416
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,460
Don't fall for him.

417
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,980
All right.

418
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,100
Make yourself comfortable.

419
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,170
Thank you.

420
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,340
Aren't you guys going to work?

421
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,810
We will...

422
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,960
I'm Krung Kring.

423
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,600
Krung Kring, get back to your work.

424
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,020
Yes.

425
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,800
I'm sitting over there.

426
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,920
Khun Nim, have you finished translating the document I assigned?
<i>(T/N: Khun, is an honorific and pronoun)</i>

427
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,180
It's done. I've already sent it through Chat-Work.

428
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,560
That was very fast. Good job.

429
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,910
I'll check it.

430
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,080
What about the document that I asked you to translate?

431
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,580
I'm working on it.

432
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,420
Please hurry. This task is already overdue.

433
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,810
The later you finish it, the more I will get blamed by the team.

434
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,820
I'm sorry.

435
00:38:46,669 --> 00:38:51,120
P'Ploy, please let me know if you need any help.

436
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,380
I've finished mine.

437
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:59,040
You work very fast, Nong Nim,
<i>(T/N: Nong refers to someone younger)</i>

438
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,540
but we do not only focus on speed here.

439
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,630
The quality of work is also important.

440
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:09,780
If you finish translating early, but there are mistakes, I don't think that's good.

441
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:15,040
- Anyway, please recheck your work.
- I will.

442
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,161
There's no mistake with your work, Khun Nim.

443
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:19,191
Make yourself comfortable.

444
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:27,720
Excuse me, I need a translator in the meeting room now.

445
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,540
Is anyone available?

446
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,680
Khun Nim, please go.

447
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,691
You aren't working on any tasks, right? Please help him.

448
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,560
- Me?
- Yes, you. Please help him.

449
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,050
You might meet the boss. Then you'll get to know him.

450
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,420
Sure.

451
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,910
<i>Noom Nim-san, I would like to remind you.</i>

I understand that you're still new to this job,

453
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,740
but the boss that you're going to meet is comprehensive.

He doesn't like any mistakes.

455
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,210
Compose yourself and then carefully translate. Understand?

456
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,491
I understand. Thank you very much.
