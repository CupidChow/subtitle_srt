1
00:00:56,202 --> 00:00:57,571
Ms. Nezumi,

2
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:01,642
Why is Mr. Mark giving me a project?

3
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,948
He doesn’t even like me.

4
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:10,605
Was what I did so unforgivable that you had to avoid me?

5
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:13,175
Ms. Nezumi,

6
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:14,664
come with me right now.

7
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:18,328
What are you doing?

8
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:19,450
Have you gone to bed?

9
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:20,498
Not yet.

10
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,138
I’m about to take a shower.

11
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:24,988
You’re home already, right?

12
00:01:25,904 --> 00:01:29,393
I just got home too.

13
00:01:48,194 --> 00:01:50,194
Here’re your meal and coffee.

14
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:52,771
Thank you.

15
00:01:57,441 --> 00:01:59,440
Ms. Nezumi?

16
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:00,614
Yes?

17
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,539
Are you sick?

18
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:05,834
No, I’m not.

19
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:08,317
Is there anything wrong?

20
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,869
About what?

21
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,472
You look strange.

22
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:15,835
Is there anything that you haven’t told me?

23
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,110
Nothing.

24
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:24,226
Are you sure?

25
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,302
Yes.

26
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:28,972
Then, please get back to work.

27
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:31,623
Yes.

28
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,830
Ms. Nezumi?

29
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:31,361
Ms. Nezumi, are you alright?

30
00:03:37,232 --> 00:03:39,232
Do you want to get up?

31
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:54,313
Hello.

32
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:55,586
Hi.

33
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:58,808
Ms. Nalinee’s condition is not a big concern.

34
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:01,769
Her body is weak now because of sleep deprivation and stress,

35
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,310
and it seems she didn’t have her meal on time.

36
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:07,331
Please take a lot of rest and have your meal on time,

37
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:09,750
and you’ll feel better.

38
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:12,301
After the IV. Fluid is used up, then you can leave.

39
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:16,693
Thank you.

40
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:29,129
Actually, you shouldn’t have brought me to the nursing room.

41
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:31,942
It’s just that I didn’t get enough sleep.

42
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:36,292
Ms. Nezumi, why didn’t you sleep?

43
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,333
Did I overwork you?

44
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:44,093
Do you know how shocked I was

45
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,686
seeing you pass out in front of my eyes?

46
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:51,003
I’m seriously worried about you, Ms. Nezumi.

47
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:57,578
I’m sorry for making you feel worried.

48
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:24,352
I have a meeting in Japan until Friday.

49
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:29,684
You can take a sick leave until you fully recover.

50
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,726
[Let me know when you arrive home.]

51
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,853
You’re back already?

52
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:01,068
Where have you been?

53
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,530
Why did you come home late again?

54
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,499
I had been working.

55
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,325
I already told you earlier.

56
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:11,483
Why does your job finish this late every day?

57
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:13,783
Does your office job really give you that much workload?

58
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:18,153
I had an urgent task, so I came back late.

59
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:23,742
You didn’t keep sticking with that Japanese Boss, did you?

60
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,814
I didn’t.

61
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,256
Boss is away now.

62
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,516
He’s in Japan working.

63
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:34,939
I’m exhausted. Please excuse me.

64
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:38,237
Noom Nim, where are you going?

65
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,749
Whenever your lie fails, you always cut the conversation short

66
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,213
and head into your room!

67
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:46,963
I already warned you before not to trust any guy that much,

68
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:48,852
especially a foreigner.

69
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:51,550
Plus, he’s your boss.

70
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:53,211
He won’t stay with you long.

71
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:55,162
He’ll soon leave.

72
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,040
If you get deceived, you can’t be sad!

73
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:03,614
I told you already that I didn’t spend time with any guy.

74
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:06,733
What kind of person do you think I am?

75
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:11,343
Nim, don’t raise your voice to me!

76
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:12,685
I’m your mom.

77
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:14,986
If you lie and I don’t blame you for that,

78
00:07:14,987 --> 00:07:16,684
what else must I do then?

79
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:21,347
But I already told you that I had been working,

80
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:22,761
but you don’t believe me.

81
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:24,037
What should I do?

82
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:26,479
Just frankly admit that you’re lying to me.

83
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,309
What’s so hard about it?

84
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:32,307
There can’t be any job that finishes this late!

85
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,702
There is.

86
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:41,140
You want to know

87
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,974
which job makes me come back home this late every day, right?

88
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:51,826
Here you are.

89
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:01,233
I translated books and websites.

90
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:03,997
I worked as an interpreter.

91
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,579
I did everything to get paid.

92
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,580
If I didn’t do all of these,

93
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:14,770
then who would earn money to pay for the car, house and all the debts

94
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:17,608
that Nut and you have incurred but never tried to solve?

95
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:26,764
Why haven’t I known about these at all?

96
00:08:33,548 --> 00:08:35,548
It’s because you never asked.

97
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,823
You never asked how I was doing

98
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:46,538
or whether I was tired.

99
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:53,513
For the car and all your debts,

100
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:56,498
I’ve so far earned almost enough to cover them.

101
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:58,094
As soon as I make it, I’ll transfer it to you.

102
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:00,978
Please return the money to Auntie Nui right away.

103
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:01,960
She is also in trouble now.

104
00:09:07,174 --> 00:09:09,174
I’m going out for a while.

105
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:13,573
Nim!

106
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:16,046
Nim!

107
00:10:27,686 --> 00:10:30,401
Nezumi, where are you now?

108
00:10:32,686 --> 00:10:34,686
At the coffee shop near my house.

109
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:37,031
Okay.

110
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:38,507
Wait there.

111
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:40,508
Don’t go anywhere.

112
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,903
What about your urgent business in Japan?

113
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,539
I closed the deal via the phone call already.

114
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,220
The client was fine with that.

115
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:37,653
Don’t worry.

116
00:12:04,912 --> 00:12:08,055
I’m sorry for having left you alone.

117
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:12,055
I’m already here to pick you up, Nezumi.

118
00:12:40,381 --> 00:12:42,381
Are you feeling better now?

119
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:47,833
Sometimes, looking far away without thinking about anything

120
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,718
just makes me feel better.

121
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:53,275
That’s not true.

122
00:12:55,916 --> 00:13:00,741
You’re feeling better because you’re with me now.

123
00:13:02,397 --> 00:13:04,397
We’re in a relationship,

124
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:06,067
so if there’s anything going on,

125
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:08,068
you must let me know.

126
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:11,017
If not, then why would you have a boyfriend for?

127
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:14,549
Just for hugging?

128
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,733
It’s not like that.

129
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,208
Just tell me about it when you feel like doing so.

130
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:28,685
Or if you don’t want to tell me

131
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:31,593
but just want me by your side like this,

132
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:33,098
then it’s up to you.

133
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:36,626
Well,

134
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,797
it’s about a financial problem in my family.

135
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:50,042
Actually, I don’t feel good either

136
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:54,675
to share my family issue with others.

137
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,834
My mom always spends money lavishly.

138
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:01,278
When she doesn’t have enough,

139
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:09,359
she will keep borrowing from friends, neighbors, or her relatives.

140
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,990
But she’s decided not to tell me about it.

141
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:16,220
In the end, it’s me who must take responsibility

142
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:18,586
by earning the money to pay off all the debts.

143
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:22,117
But she’s my mom anyway.

144
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:27,046
I can’t let myself do nothing or scold her.

145
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:31,885
But it’s just that…

146
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:38,384
I do feel tired for always having to solve all the things I’ve never caused.

147
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:42,571
And that’s why you also worked hard for other jobs

148
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:44,238
without telling me either, right?

149
00:14:47,743 --> 00:14:49,743
You knew?

150
00:14:52,702 --> 00:14:55,566
It’s not that I didn’t want to tell you or anything,

151
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:59,696
but I know that you yourself already have lots of problems to deal with.

152
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:02,806
I don’t want to give you any more burden to worry about.

153
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,837
But how can it be fine to me

154
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:11,843
to see my girlfriend in trouble like this?

155
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,955
Am I right?

156
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,512
Silly kid.

157
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:19,474
I’m sorry.

158
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:22,734
Next time, I will think more carefully.

159
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:31,127
Promise me that you won’t do like this again.

160
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,181
Yes.

161
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:41,116
Come here.

162
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:09,855
If you have a boyfriend, and he’s not reliable,

163
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:13,466
then it means that I’m the worst boyfriend in the world.

164
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,860
That’s not true.

165
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:22,132
You’re the best boyfriend on earth.

166
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:33,753
Do you want to go home now

167
00:16:36,384 --> 00:16:38,384
or eat something first?

168
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:40,720
I’m not hungry.

169
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:44,978
I’ll drive you home then.

170
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:52,736
I don’t want to go home yet.

171
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,604
So, where are you going to sleep tonight?

172
00:16:58,971 --> 00:17:02,151
I guess I’ll go to my friend’s place.

173
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:05,685
I don’t allow you to.

174
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:17,072
I saw that you didn’t eat much in the evening.

175
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:19,676
Thank you.

176
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:26,221
I was about to tell you to blow on it first because it’s hot.

177
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:28,399
Are you alright?

178
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,742
Let me see.

179
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,851
It’s no longer hot, right?

180
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:03,432
Drink your milk first.

181
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:05,160
I’ll go upstairs to arrange the bed for you.

182
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:07,845
You don’t need to.

183
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,887
I’ll sleep on the sofa.

184
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:14,181
What kind of man will let his girlfriend sleep on the sofa?

185
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:17,519
But this is your place.

186
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,402
How can I let you sleep on the sofa?

187
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:26,661
Well, I won’t be sleeping on the sofa either.

188
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:29,117
Huh?

189
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:30,964
Why are you surprised?

190
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:32,965
We slept on the same bed before, didn’t we?

191
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,850
Do you remember?

192
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:41,745
I was drunk then!

193
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:44,224
I have some Umeshu here.

194
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:45,541
Boss!

195
00:18:48,164 --> 00:18:49,384
I know.

196
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:51,221
I’m just kidding.

197
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:55,414
You’re going to sleep in my room.

198
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:56,971
I will sleep on the sofa.

199
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,444
But…

200
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
I’m the owner of this room,

201
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:08,286
so you have two options.

202
00:19:10,186 --> 00:19:14,800
Sleep alone in the room or sleep together with me.

203
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:22,482
What’s your choice?

204
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:53,219
You’re still up?

205
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:56,699
Yes.

206
00:19:57,224 --> 00:19:59,224
I have insomnia.

207
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:01,773
I’m not familiar with the place.

208
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:04,877
Would you like to sleep in your room upstairs?

209
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:08,730
I can sleep on the sofa, so I can also watch TV.

210
00:20:10,947 --> 00:20:12,947
Let’s watch it together then.

211
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Smells so good.

212
00:23:17,968 --> 00:23:19,968
You can cook?

213
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:21,869
Morning.

214
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,140
You’re up already?

215
00:23:25,415 --> 00:23:27,415
I woke up because of the good smell.

216
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,108
I didn’t know that you can cook.

217
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:35,900
You always cook for me,

218
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:37,993
so I want to cook for you, too.

219
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:42,474
Don’t you like it?

220
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,719
Of course, I like it.

221
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:53,333
It’s so nice having a boyfriend who cooks for me.

222
00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:56,276
I’ll eat now.

223
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:02,368
Let me see.

224
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:11,086
Very yummy!

225
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:13,495
I want to have breakfast like this every day.

226
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:16,589
So, stay here

227
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:21,559
forever if you want.

228
00:24:24,978 --> 00:24:26,977
How can I?

229
00:24:26,978 --> 00:24:29,053
I have a home to go back to.

230
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:36,046
How will you deal with that issue then?

231
00:24:43,026 --> 00:24:44,748
I don’t know yet.

232
00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:49,178
I spoke to my mom badly yesterday.

233
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:54,707
I don’t have any courage to go back now.

234
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,013
I dare not confront her.

235
00:24:58,979 --> 00:25:03,820
Having a home to go back to is totally a great thing.

236
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,769
If you were me, would you go back?

237
00:25:15,752 --> 00:25:17,126
Me?

238
00:25:18,354 --> 00:25:20,354
I don’t know either.

239
00:25:23,442 --> 00:25:26,834
We’d better eat now, or we will be late for work.

240
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:44,582
Nezumi, is it cold?

241
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:49,088
Not really.

242
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,638
It’s rather hot.

243
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:52,418
Is that so?

244
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:53,977
Should I turn up the air-con?

245
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:54,971
It’s alright.

246
00:26:03,577 --> 00:26:07,432
You’ve ridden in my car for many times already.

247
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:08,975
You aren’t used to it yet?

248
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:14,131
If we’re going somewhere else,

249
00:26:14,132 --> 00:26:16,264
then it doesn’t feel strange to me,

250
00:26:16,265 --> 00:26:17,601
but now we’re heading to the office.

251
00:26:18,154 --> 00:26:20,153
To the office?

252
00:26:20,154 --> 00:26:21,831
So what?

253
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:28,414
Well, we’re dating now,

254
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:30,458
but others at the office don’t know about it yet.

255
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,403
If anyone sees us arriving at the office together,

256
00:26:35,404 --> 00:26:37,922
we could be gossiped.

257
00:26:39,527 --> 00:26:41,083
That’s why.

258
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:42,308
You don’t need to care about it.

259
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,990
Don’t underestimate how gossipy office girls are!

260
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,338
They can turn a single truth into hundreds of stories through gossips.

261
00:26:50,673 --> 00:26:55,900
So, what should I do?

262
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:01,134
Just drop me there.

263
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,611
There’s a motorbike taxi over there.

264
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:05,646
It won’t take long to arrive at the office.

265
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:06,948
You’re sure you want it that way?

266
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:09,472
Yes.

267
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:10,899
Believe me.

268
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,758
I don’t want to put you in trouble.

269
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,556
Alright.

270
00:27:15,695 --> 00:27:17,419
Over there.

271
00:27:26,835 --> 00:27:28,835
Hey, why aren’t you upstairs yet?

272
00:27:29,957 --> 00:27:31,957
I’m about to go now.

273
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:36,829
Please go ahead.

274
00:27:40,443 --> 00:27:42,443
What’s wrong?

275
00:27:45,908 --> 00:27:47,908
Hello, Boss.

276
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:51,514
Good Morning.

277
00:27:58,204 --> 00:27:59,785
Why are you still staring at me?

278
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:01,122
Why don’t you go first?

279
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:04,643
Hello, Boss.

280
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:09,361
Hi.

281
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:38,261
What’s with that face?

282
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:40,671
I have something to talk to you.

283
00:28:52,822 --> 00:28:55,900
If you still pretend that you didn’t hear what I said,

284
00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:58,589
I’ll handle you now.

285
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,710
I’m sorry.

286
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:08,459
I give up now.

287
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,548
What are you going to say?

288
00:29:13,345 --> 00:29:16,064
I don’t want to hide our relationship from others.

289
00:29:16,717 --> 00:29:19,715
Why are you afraid of gossips?

290
00:29:21,382 --> 00:29:23,382
That’s because I’m worried about you.

291
00:29:24,492 --> 00:29:26,492
Worried about me?

292
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:30,505
They will criticize you if they find out about our relationship.

293
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:36,919
If you treat me well, they will say that it’s because we’re dating.

294
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:43,760
If you tell me off, they will say that we have a fight.

295
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,008
They will keep their eyes on our reactions.

296
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:49,058
I think it will be more difficult for us to work.

297
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:54,453
Do you understand?

298
00:29:57,068 --> 00:30:00,460
You’re more mature than I thought, Ms. Nezumi.

299
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,033
I’ll give you a reward.

300
00:30:09,794 --> 00:30:12,780
Mr. Akitsuki, I’ll go in now.

301
00:30:12,951 --> 00:30:14,951
Please come in!

302
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:29,771
Ms. Rena,

303
00:30:29,772 --> 00:30:31,662
would you like me to now proceed what we discussed in the meeting today?

304
00:30:31,987 --> 00:30:33,365
Yes.

305
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:36,643
Send an e-mail to inform all the staff at the Bangkok office.

306
00:30:37,217 --> 00:30:39,810
I’ll manage the rest of the things myself.

307
00:30:39,878 --> 00:30:41,425
Well-noted, Ms. Rena.

308
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:56,768
Boss, do you have anything else that needs washing apart from these?

309
00:30:56,769 --> 00:30:57,726
What are you doing?

310
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:00,457
Are you going to wash my clothes for me?

311
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,368
Yes.

312
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:04,057
Please let me do something.

313
00:31:04,058 --> 00:31:05,709
I don’t want to just do nothing.

314
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,904
That’s great,

315
00:31:08,391 --> 00:31:11,980
so you can practice being my housewife.

316
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:16,341
Boss, are you imaging things too far?

317
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:18,438
I’ve only been working for a few months.

318
00:31:22,656 --> 00:31:26,232
But I’ve been dreaming of having a family since I was 15.

319
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:32,072
You’ve longed to have a family since you were still a teen?

320
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,983
Yes.

321
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,195
Why is that so?

322
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:07,917
Why haven’t you taken a shower and gone to bed?

323
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
Is there anything wrong?

324
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,088
No.

325
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,050
I’m just thinking about tomorrow’s work.

326
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,820
About the work you’ll be discussing in Sriracha, right?

327
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:25,260
Are you sure that I don’t have to go with you?

328
00:32:26,272 --> 00:32:28,272
You don’t have to go.

329
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,387
Or…

330
00:32:36,861 --> 00:32:38,861
are you actually going to meet up with a girl there?!

331
00:32:43,382 --> 00:32:45,382
Since my girlfriend is this nice,

332
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:48,985
who else will I meet up with?

333
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,556
Please take a rest.

334
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:59,917
When I come back, let’s eat out together.

335
00:33:06,656 --> 00:33:08,238
But if there’s anything on your mind,

336
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:10,256
you must tell me.

337
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:16,345
Actually, there is one.

338
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:18,914
What is it?

339
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:22,306
When you’re off work,

340
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,360
stop calling me Boss already.

341
00:33:29,428 --> 00:33:31,428
What should I call you?

342
00:33:32,452 --> 00:33:37,190
Mr. Koji or darling will do.

343
00:33:43,244 --> 00:33:45,900
I’ll call you...

344
00:33:47,912 --> 00:33:49,912
Mr. Koji then.

345
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:27,755
What are you doing, Ms. Nezumi?

346
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:35,376
I was cleaning your room and tidying up the closet,

347
00:35:35,377 --> 00:35:41,040
but then I accidentally saw this box, so I thought…

348
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,813
I’m sorry.

349
00:35:42,814 --> 00:35:43,710
That’s enough.

350
00:35:45,236 --> 00:35:47,236
I’m not angry with you.

351
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,579
You look frustrated, so…

352
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,637
Nope.

353
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,529
I just don’t know what to say.

354
00:35:58,763 --> 00:36:02,341
Is this a picture of you?

355
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:07,012
Yes.

356
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,878
If you didn’t want me to see it,

357
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:15,948
I’m sorry.

358
00:36:19,117 --> 00:36:23,843
Actually, I was thinking about sharing this story with you.

359
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:29,090
Anyway, I’ll tell you now.

360
00:36:36,588 --> 00:36:40,392
At first, I tore my dad’s part out of this picture

361
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:42,571
when he divorced my mother.

362
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,100
He left us and went back to Canada.

363
00:36:48,323 --> 00:36:54,955
I was so young that I didn’t know the true reason of their divorce.

364
00:36:57,457 --> 00:36:59,457
I only knew that he had left us,

365
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:09,833
so I ripped his part because of my childish anger.

366
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:21,663
But ripping it didn’t make anything better.

367
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:34,221
My mom brought me to Thailand

368
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:36,109
after some time following their divorce.

369
00:37:37,061 --> 00:37:39,368
In the beginning, we didn’t have much money,

370
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:46,821
so my mom had to go out almost every day for work.

371
00:37:47,363 --> 00:37:50,489
At first, it looked like she was just normally working.

372
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,538
But after I saw my mom with that man,

373
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:54,095
everything had changed.

374
00:37:55,228 --> 00:37:58,498
I’ll transfer the money in every month

375
00:37:58,499 --> 00:38:00,334
if it’s possible.

376
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:10,362
Mom…

377
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:13,782
Can you not go?

378
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:16,661
I’m sorry, Koji.

379
00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:36,035
At first, I tried to contact her, but I always got declined.

380
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,707
So, I swore to myself that I wouldn’t associate with her ever again.

381
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:48,329
Two years later, she called me, but I didn’t care.

382
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,403
I cut her off from all my contact channels,

383
00:38:57,915 --> 00:39:00,243
and I went back to Osaka.

384
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:13,187
I had to struggle doing various jobs

385
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,271
to earn myself money to study.

386
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,170
Before I’m here as who I am now,

387
00:39:23,413 --> 00:39:25,767
I’ve been through so many things.

388
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:32,934
One day, I received the bad news from Thailand.

389
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:39,297
My mom had a cancer

390
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:44,600
and passed away

391
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:47,201
before I managed to get back to Thailand.

392
00:39:52,883 --> 00:39:54,883
That made me question myself.

393
00:39:55,896 --> 00:40:00,396
If that day I had decided to open up my mind and pick up her call,

394
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,958
would things have somehow changed?

395
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
That’s what I’ve always been thinking.

396
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,624
I understand your feeling towards your mom

397
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,594
because I experienced it before.

398
00:40:20,656 --> 00:40:25,177
Anyway, your mom might have something she wants to tell you,

399
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:27,557
but she’s never said it before.

400
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:04,381
Can you stay here with me for one more night?

401
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:10,334
Please.

402
00:41:10,436 --> 00:41:13,395
I’ll drive you home early in the morning.

403
00:41:13,396 --> 00:41:14,536
Please?

404
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:23,686
Since you’re being so adorably clingy like this,

405
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:26,733
I guess I must give in.

406
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,880
Don’t be naughty.

407
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:51,228
Otherwise, I can’t finish packing up.

408
00:41:51,229 --> 00:41:52,142
That’s fine.

409
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:53,722
Stay with me first.

410
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:55,961
Hey, don’t! I must pack up my things.

411
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:22,004
Have you guys heard about the new COO from Japan?

412
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:25,490
This new COO will be responsible for the restructuring

413
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:27,873
and the reshuffling of some roles.

414
00:42:28,098 --> 00:42:30,097
Because this COO is no ordinary woman.

415
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:31,775
You guys probably know her.

416
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,929
It’s been a while, Ms. Noom Nim.
