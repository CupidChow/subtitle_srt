Oh, Nong Nim.

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,820
Hello, P'Ja Oh.

21
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,900
You're early today. What's up?

22
00:02:30,446 --> 00:02:32,046
Well,

23
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,669
I'm here to submit my resignation letter.

24
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,069
Are you resigning?

25
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:41,613
Why so suddenly? You've just started working here.

26
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:44,200
Is it because you don't like your secretary job?

27
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,040
The job itself is not a problem for me.

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,613
Or is it because of what Ploy and them have been gossiping about?

29
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:54,816
Don't think too much. They are just talking nonsense.

30
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,653
Well, I have a personal matter,

31
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:03,300
but I can't tell you now.

32
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,600
P'Ja Oh, can you please help me?

33
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,366
All right then.

34
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:18,540
But have you talked to Boss

35
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,280
before bringing your resignation letter to me?

36
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:23,166
Not yet.

37
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,220
How about this?

38
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,426
According to company policy, you can hand in your resignation, but in the end,

39
00:03:31,426 --> 00:03:36,033
the person who can approve it is your direct boss.

40
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:41,330
Your position is the boss's secretary. Therefore, the one who can approve your letter—

41
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,346
The boss?

42
00:03:46,157 --> 00:03:49,620
I can only help submit your letter to Boss.

43
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,600
But whether he will sign it or not, I cannot say.

44
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,680
Are you okay with this?

45
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,660
Yes.

46
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,666
Thank you.

47
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,193
Nong Nim!

48
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,390
I finally found you here!

49
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,706
Are you here to see Boss? He's not in now.

50
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:28,449
No, I'm not. I'm looking for you.

51
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,260
What is it?

52
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,180
Do you remember that Khun Mark mentioned during the meeting

53
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,866
that he wanted you as his AE for this project?

54
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,226
About that...

55
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:45,880
I remember.

56
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,696
Great! That's a relief.

57
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:51,230
This is what I'm going to talk to you about.

58
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,880
Well, this job is super easy.

59
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,753
As an AE, you will coordinate work between Khun Mark and my team.

60
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:03,813
My team will be in charge of media and the technical stuff.

61
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:07,566
All you have to do is coordinate and manage the briefing.

62
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,673
That's a piece of cake, right?

63
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:11,420
You can do it, right?

64
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,193
- What about Boss?
- Boss?

65
00:05:14,193 --> 00:05:17,309
I already asked for his permission this morning.

66
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:19,464
He approved it.

67
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:21,940
- Did he?
- Yes.

68
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,166
He just said, you must manage your time for your main job well.

69
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:30,006
That's it. Just relax. It's easy, right?

70
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:32,000
I have no problem with that then.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,060
Thank you, Nong Nim!

72
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,420
I'm going to meet Boss at the studio. You can come with me.

73
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,940
Do I have to go right now?

74
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:46,006
Yes. I'll give you ten minutes to get ready. Let's meet outside.

75
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:47,186
All right.

76
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:48,460
See you.

77
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,960
Sure.

78
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,734
Keep glaring.

79
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,368
Move your face up a bit.

80
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,050
Good job.

81
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,510
‎

82
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,213
What's that?

83
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:20,806
Why are the pants poking out like that?

84
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:27,000
The concept we planned is a lively look like this, right?

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,270
And we're going to have close-up shots later, right? For different camera angles?

86
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,470
Take one step forward.

87
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,287
Do we have other outfits?

88
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,453
Enough for now, please.

89
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,560
Bifern, you did a great job, but can you make it livelier?

90
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,853
I want more of a J-pop vibe. Can you do that?

91
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:20,313
I have no idea how to pose. Do you have a reference for me?

92
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,080
What do you think?

93
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,900
I have no idea, either.

94
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,560
Let's do this then.

95
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,380
Should I try doing the same thing we did when we went out together?

96
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,073
Please get changed first.

97
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,800
We'll have a 15-minute break, please.

98
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:29,428
How is it?

99
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:33,848
Do you like the model that I've chosen?

100
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,200
She did well,

101
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,990
but it looks like she doesn't quite understand the concept.

102
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,440
You know well that Bifern is the sexy type.

103
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,660
I guess you must adjust yourself to that.

104
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,263
If she's the model that our client has selected, we won't disagree.

105
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,823
Is this also the reason why

106
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:06,896
you even allowed your secretary to become my project coordinator?

107
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:13,220
All my employees are willing to do their best for the client's satisfaction.

108
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,890
That's great.

109
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,480
because I like a company that values work over personal matters.

110
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,800
This means that you don't have any problem with Khun Noom Nim working with me.

111
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,950
Is that right?

112
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:30,793
If it's related to work, then there's no problem.

113
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:32,906
What if it's something else?

114
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,700
What do you mean by that?

115
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,813
You have worked with quite a lot of women.

116
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:47,253
You must already know the reason why most of them approach us.

117
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,280
Take Bifern, for example.

118
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,093
Or even your young secretary...

119
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,060
What are you trying to tell me, Khun Mark?

120
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,700
You can speak frankly. I don't like beating around the bush.

121
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,766
Akitsuki-san...

122
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:10,481
it's nothing much, actually.

123
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:13,575
I just wanted to remind you

124
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:19,866
not to be too fascinated by your beautiful secretary.

125
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:25,633
Yes, she's talented, but she's no different from other women who approach their boss for their own benefit—

126
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:27,290
That's it, right there.

127
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,610
What did you say?

128
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,760
I don't know about others,

129
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,780
but as far as I've known Noom Nim, she's not like what you said.

130
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,480
Are you angry?

131
00:10:48,693 --> 00:10:50,773
I'm just kidding.

132
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,900
Are you being so protective

133
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,018
because you've secretly been with her already?

134
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:07,220
When I want someone, I'm not the type to sneak around.

135
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,060
That's because I've never been in a relationship just for fun,

136
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,680
unlike some bad-mouthed losers

137
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,256
who like to look down on others and disrespect others' dignity just to make themselves look superior.

138
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:25,640
Please excuse me. I'll get back to work.

139
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,526
- P'In?
- Yes?

140
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:07,200
P'In, are you certain that the boss allowed me to come here?

141
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,663
Of course. He confirmed with me himself.

142
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:24,193
Nong Nim, please don't worry about redundant tasks. I'll manage them for you.

143
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:29,626
You just need to complete the tasks you're assigned. That's it.

144
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,666
Is that so?

145
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,000
That's all there is.

146
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,229
That's beautiful.

147
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:08,476
We can add products in.

148
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,280
Hello.

149
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,586
How is everything going?

150
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:23,400
We are on the second set now. What about the model?

151
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,873
Any problem? It's going well, right?

152
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:34,443
Well then, please take care of this.

153
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,080
How is it going?

154
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:47,841
We are on the second set now. What about the model?

155
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:48,913
She has finished changing outfits.

156
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:50,695
Is everything ready?

157
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,240
Nong Nim!

158
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,730
‎P'Yia,

159
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,960
‎it should be softer.

Hello, Boss.

161
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,313
Hello, Hazobe-san.

162
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:03,340
Hey, In-san and Noom Nim-san.

163
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,540
- How did you get here?
- I drove.

164
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,180
I discussed what you said with Nong Nim, Boss.

165
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,833
And then we came here right away.

166
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,133
All right.

167
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,820
This is your first time visiting a set, right, Noom Nim-san?

168
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,130
You can do it!

169
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,856
Thank you! I will!

170
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:23,317
You're here to see our client, aren't you?

171
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,006
Have you met him?

172
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:28,570
Hello,

173
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,960
Khun In and Khun Noom Nim. I've been waiting for you.

174
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,286
Hello, Khun Mark.

175
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:37,160
How is it going? Has the shooting been going well?

176
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,880
It's going great. We've just finished the first half.

177
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
We're about to check all the photos out.

178
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,353
Would you like to see them together?

179
00:14:43,353 --> 00:14:46,149
Nong Nim, let's check them out.

180
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,940
Please pull up the photos.

181
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,370
Next, please.

182
00:14:52,293 --> 00:14:53,793
Go on.

183
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:57,466
Next, please.

184
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,440
Next.

185
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:03,813
Keep going.

186
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,900
I like the previous photo.

187
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:13,953
Pause here.

188
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,586
Don't you guys think it's strange?

189
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,200
What is strange?

190
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:26,006
The concept of this product is J-Pop.

191
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:29,753
It should be cheerful and innocent in a Japanese style with a beach vibe.

192
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:31,553
Am I right?

193
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:33,380
Look at Bifern's face.

194
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,980
Has she been heartbroken for ten years, or what?

195
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,773
And I don't see any Japanese vibe in it.

196
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,533
Well, I don't think the photos are that bad.

197
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,770
Really?

198
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,043
No, I think they're bad.

199
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:59,556
Take a look. None of the photos matches the concept that we planned.

200
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,466
I think something is amiss.

201
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,980
Or is it because Bifern is not suitable for this job?

202
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,440
What do you think, Akitsuki-san?

203
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:18,430
Yes, but I think that Baifern can adjust her style

204
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,633
if we give her time, according to what you said.

205
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:25,770
I'm just proposing what I want.

206
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:30,526
Your job is to control the work quality.

207
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:34,013
If you think there's something wrong, then just decline it.

208
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:36,622
If not, then why would I hire your team?

209
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,620
Khun Mark, if you would like to modify anything,

210
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,246
our company is willing to do it for you,

211
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:56,100
but it's just that we might need to cancel today's shoot first and reschedule it.

212
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,000
No.

213
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,160
I want the shoot to be done today.

214
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:07,013
My product has already been promoted. The press conference date has also been scheduled.

215
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:09,313
I won't postpone the shoot.

216
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:14,513
Your job is to find me a new model today.

217
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,220
She must match with our concept.

218
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,386
The best choice would be a Japanese model.

219
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:25,296
But Khun Mark...

220
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:29,240
"But" means that you can't solve it. Is that right?

221
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:35,656
I will tell everyone that ViperX company is irresponsible,

222
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:38,460
and you fail to do as advertised.

223
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,580
It's all right. I will find a way to solve it.

224
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,266
This is not your responsibility.

225
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,953
I can handle it myself.

226
00:17:52,953 --> 00:17:54,553
That's great.

227
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:03,713
But I just want to warn you that if you can't find a new model within an hour,

228
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,295
I will cancel all the projects I'm working on with ViperX.

229
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,220
Khun Baifern! Khun Baifern!

230
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,193
Khun Baifern!

231
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,020
- Is she in Thailand now?
<i> - Hello.</i>

232
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,206
- Yes? Oh, you want us to contact you again later?
<i> - We'd like to request a model from your agency.</i>

233
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:47,576
- Leave it there.
<i> - Yes, today. Right now.</i>

234
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:48,946
- Please hand me a pen.
<i>- Just for an hour.</i>

235
00:18:48,946 --> 00:18:51,060
<i>Could you kindly do something, please?</i>

236
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,940
<i>Please! We really need your help.</i>

237
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,650
Note down this person and call them back later.

238
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,750
I can't get a hold of them.

239
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,800
- Hazobe!
- Yes?

240
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,510
Call all Japanese actresses, artists, and models we know who are currently in Thailand.

241
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,800
I got it.

242
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,309
She's not there?

243
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:15,680
- Hello? Okay. Thank you.
<i> - Hello. Is there any model who is available?</i>

244
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,420
‎- She is available?
- Yes.

245
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,470
Please give me a pen.

246
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,970
Please.

247
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:21,570
Yes.

248
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:27,320
Sure, okay. Here, try contacting this person.

249
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,753
I told you that you don't have to do anything.

250
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,533
Well, I just think that finding a model within an hour is—

251
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,526
I know what I'm doing.

252
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:37,050
Please leave now. I have to work.

253
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,751
What about her?

254
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,700
‎How about...

255
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,116
- Oh, yes!
- Sure. I will try to contact her.

256
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:51,173
Hello.

257
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:52,986
She's not available?

258
00:19:52,986 --> 00:19:57,003
All right then. I will contact another person.

259
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,306
The news has reached Japan so soon?

260
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:06,373
That was fast.

261
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,743
Nope. I won't accept any other offer.

262
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:15,120
I give them only one hour.

263
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,060
If they fail, the game is over.

264
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,542
- Do you have anyone else?
- I'll try to contact them again.

265
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,500
Yes, hello.

266
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,556
- How is it going?
- I'm still looking.

267
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:42,610
Okay. Please search some more.

268
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,380
Yes.

269
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,886
- Can you find a Japanese model within one hour?
- What about the other modeling agencies we've used?

270
00:20:49,886 --> 00:20:52,773
This is urgent. We have no more time left.

271
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,880
We haven't contacted this one yet.

272
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,630
Do your best. We only have 40 minutes left.

273
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,540
- Okay.
- All right.

274
00:21:03,113 --> 00:21:06,896
Can you find someone else? She still looks Thai.

275
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,530
I can't find anyone.

276
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,830
Let me take a look.

277
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,410
- We must find a Japanese model within an hour.
<i> - Yes. Well, let me see...</i>

278
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,493
Please excuse me for a while.

279
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:20,013
Khun Mark, I have an offer for you.

280
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:24,320
I've contacted a Japanese girl group.

281
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,380
They are all ready to fly here and shoot for your ads,

282
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,620
but we must postpone the shooting day to tomorrow.

283
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,700
You always surprise me.

284
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:47,453
All right.

285
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:49,780
I'll take that offer,

286
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,426
but under one condition.

287
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,813
You must kneel and apologize to me.

288
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:07,113
That's already too much!

289
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,806
Koji?

290
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,396
- Koji?
- Let it be.

291
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,180
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

292
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,160
I've found you a new model.

293
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,200
Miyakawa Azuki?

294
00:24:57,093 --> 00:25:01,976
Just tell me what you want me to do. I'm not free all day for this.

295
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,040
Please go ahead.

296
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,840
This way, please.

297
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,970
Okay. Try to make a different pose for every photo shoot.

298
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,360
Okay, okay, okay.

299
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,500
I hope that you like the model we've selected this time.

300
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,490
<i>Brighter. Yes, brighter.</i>

301
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,250
<i>That's good.</i>

302
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,070
Can you look a little surprised?

303
00:25:47,823 --> 00:25:50,450
Nong Nim, can I ask you directly?

304
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,686
How did you get to know Miyakawa Azuki-san? She's a real top idol.

305
00:25:55,686 --> 00:25:57,140
Her schedule is also very tight.

306
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,246
I've been trying to contact her to shoot for our company,

307
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:03,926
but I always failed.

308
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,290
Well, I...

309
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:11,960
met her during my freelance job before I started working for this company.

310
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,420
We are very lucky that she's still available.

311
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:21,780
I think this is beyond simple luck. You must have something great on you.

312
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,820
Let's see. Do you have any amulets?

313
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,590
- Show me your lock screen.
- I don't have anything.

314
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,336
- I have nothing at all.
- Are you certain?

315
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,203
Are you sure? If you have something good—

316
00:26:30,203 --> 00:26:32,909
Let's watch the shoot.

317
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,486
I'll pick up my call. I'll be back.

318
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,966
How is it? Are the photos all right?

319
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:53,469
Good, right?

320
00:26:53,469 --> 00:26:56,503
Hello, Rena-san.

321
00:26:56,503 --> 00:27:00,353
In, we're shooting the ads for Khun Mark, right? How is it going?

322
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:02,340
We're in the middle of the shoot.

323
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,946
I've already found a model for you. She'll be there within 30 minutes.

324
00:27:06,946 --> 00:27:08,233
Please take care of her.

325
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:10,300
A Japanese model?

326
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,986
We don't need her anymore, Rena-san. We already found a new model.

327
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:16,506
Pardon? You have? Who is she?

328
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,700
It's Miyakawa Azuki-san.

329
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,890
Azuki? Who contacted her?

330
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,596
Nong Noom Nim did. She's Akitsuki-san's secretary.

331
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:28,796
She contacted her for us.

332
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,960
Book me a plane ticket to Thailand.

333
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,910
<i>When would you like to fly, Boss?</i>

334
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,833
Right now.

335
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,060
‎- Is it okay?
- I think it's enough.

336
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,500
It's a wrap for today.

337
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,200
Great job, everyone. Great job, everyone.

338
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,393
Noom Nim-san!

339
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,440
How did I do today?

340
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,960
Amazing.

341
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,173
Thank you for thinking of me today. It was lucky that I was still available.

342
00:28:21,173 --> 00:28:24,766
But even if not, I would have cancelled my schedule to help you anyway.

343
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:26,826
I already feel so grateful that you're helping me here.

344
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:32,273
Likewise. Thank you for helping me back then. By the way,

345
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:34,376
Manager Ken is getting sued soon.

346
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:36,776
I'm happy for you, Azuki.

347
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,750
Noom Nim-san.

348
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,830
Yes, Khun Mark?

349
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,833
I must really thank you for this.

350
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:08,760
Without you, I surely would have been in trouble today.

351
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,490
Sure.

352
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,590
Well then...

353
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,360
if...

354
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:21,580
you need anything in return, please let me know.

355
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,376
I can give you everything.

356
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:26,296
Thank you.

357
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,920
Can I hug you once?

358
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,170
Thank you very much.

359
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,520
Thank you, Khun Mark.

360
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,760
I'll be on my way now.

361
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,366
This is all I wanted to tell you.

362
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:44,113
All right.

363
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,810
Hey, I thought you were going to the restroom.

364
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,266
Do you always allow men to easily touch you like this?

365
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:05,680
Khun Mark is our client.

366
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,190
I see.

367
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:12,366
Because he's our client, you are pleased to serve him with everything.

368
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:16,060
You even offer yourself to solve the problem. That's amazing.

369
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:21,693
Do you still remember your job description, that you're my secretary?

370
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,846
But you said it yourself that I should do both jobs well.

371
00:30:26,846 --> 00:30:28,849
Did I ask for your help?

372
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,653
When did I say that?

373
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:38,340
I can solve the problem by myself. Do you understand?

374
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,338
I didn't say this because I'm frustrated.

375
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:47,150
What you said is already clear enough.

376
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,973
I'm sorry for meddling,

377
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:56,463
but I just wanted this work to go well.

378
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:58,933
Was I really that wrong?

379
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:02,993
I just want you to work in accordance with your job description.

380
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:05,713
Then stop pushing me to do other jobs.

381
00:31:05,713 --> 00:31:09,720
I applied to be an interpreter, but you transferred me to the role of secretary.

382
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,186
Then you assigned me to do this AE job.

383
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:15,670
I really don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore.

384
00:31:17,686 --> 00:31:18,886
Nezumi-san...

385
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:20,620
Boss,

386
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,830
if you feel uncomfortable with this,

387
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,400
you won't have to bear with it for long.

388
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,930
I already submitted my resignation letter.

389
00:31:55,473 --> 00:31:57,273
Nong Nim?

390
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,030
Why are you sitting here crying?

391
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,670
<i>[This is Mark. Please reply to my Line message, Khun Noom Nim.]</i>

392
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,410
<i>[What time will you get off work tomorrow?]</i>

393
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,833
<i>This is Mark. What time do you get off work tomorrow?</i>

394
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,493
P'In, Khun Mark sent me messages on Line.

395
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:26,663
Yes, and so what?

396
00:32:26,663 --> 00:32:32,610
I don't remember giving my Line account or my number to anyone.

397
00:32:33,393 --> 00:32:36,773
- I was the one who gave it to him.
- P'In...

398
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:39,540
I had to, Nong Nim.

399
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:44,460
Khun Mark is extremely difficult to reach, and he's also very strict.

400
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,333
I really need to maintain our connection with the client.

401
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:52,076
- But P'In...
- Only for this time!

402
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:54,010
Please.

403
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,716
Can you please help me?

404
00:32:55,716 --> 00:32:57,816
Please?

405
00:32:57,816 --> 00:32:59,550
All right.

406
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:11,590
<i>At 6 p.m.</i>

407
00:33:16,647 --> 00:33:20,200
<i>I'll pick you up. Let's go out for dinner.</i>

408
00:33:25,678 --> 00:33:28,378
<i>I don't think that's good.</i>

409
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:44,240
<i>It's good since I would like to discuss more about work.</i>

410
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,056
<i>See you tomorrow at 6 p.m. I have to go to your office anyway.</i>

411
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,969
<i>Don't say no.</i>

412
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,580
- Boss...
- This morning,

413
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:30,720
I have a conference call with a client in Hong Kong.

414
00:35:30,726 --> 00:35:32,853
Let's talk later.

415
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,980
You're stirring so much that the coffee and cup will combine.

416
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,220
Are you stressed?

417
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,660
Did Koji assign you too much work?

418
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:24,560
No. I was just thinking about stuff.

419
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,206
If he does anything bad to you, let me know. I'll sort him out.

420
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:33,900
You might get told off again.

421
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,780
He's my boss so he has the right to do anything.

422
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,820
You're really sulking.

423
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,933
I'm not sulking.

424
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,320
Noom Nim-chan, please change your mind about resigning.

425
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,700
Do you know about it, too?

426
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,800
Do you remember when Boss kneeled for Khun Mark?

427
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,240
Having to kneel for a matter that isn't one's fault,

428
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,510
is considered a dire situation for Japanese people.

429
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:13,913
But he yielded because he knew that work is important.

430
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,333
We were still lucky that you helped us on time.

431
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:29,086
I didn't help much.

432
00:37:29,086 --> 00:37:30,380
You did.

433
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:35,186
Both our boss and you are really devoted to work.

434
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,946
I think you two are a perfect match.

435
00:37:48,617 --> 00:37:51,893
If there's any problem, please talk to him.

436
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:55,729
Talk nicely to each other. Every problem can be solved.

437
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:02,820
I'm not available. I'm sorry.

438
00:38:03,557 --> 00:38:06,326
P'In, it won't take long.

439
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:09,180
Please accompany me to have dinner with Khun Mark.

440
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,326
I guess it won't take longer than two hours.

441
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:15,380
Please come with me.

442
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,886
I also want to go, but I already have an appointment with my family.

443
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:21,386
I don't want to miss it.

444
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,866
Come on, P'In.

445
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,526
I know I'm the cause of this matter, but I really can't go.

446
00:38:32,526 --> 00:38:38,473
Plus, if I went to see him without telling him beforehand, he would certainly get angry at me.

447
00:38:38,473 --> 00:38:40,786
Please help me check this.

448
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:43,313
I don't think so.

449
00:38:43,313 --> 00:38:46,436
Please check this marketing point as well as the graphs.

450
00:38:46,436 --> 00:38:49,913
P'In, please go with me.

451
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,186
Nong Nim, consider it helping me out.

452
00:38:56,186 --> 00:39:00,653
Khun Mark may seem quite mean when working, but he's actually not.

453
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:05,143
He's such a gentleman. Please don't be scared of him.

454
00:39:05,897 --> 00:39:07,853
Or do you want me to beg you like this?

455
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:10,200
Please don't. You don't need to.

456
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,389
All right then. I can go with him alone.

457
00:39:20,206 --> 00:39:23,600
I believe that you can do it.

458
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,330
Good luck!

459
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,268
Is everything all right?

460
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,550
This has been signed.

461
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,550
Thank you.

462
00:40:06,346 --> 00:40:08,720
Noom Nim!

463
00:40:12,337 --> 00:40:14,426
You haven't gone home yet?

464
00:40:14,426 --> 00:40:18,260
Not yet, but I'll be leaving soon. I have an appointment later.

465
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:23,006
Really? You'd better hurry. Otherwise, the Skytrain will be too crowded.

466
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:25,700
Sure. What about you? Are you not leaving yet?

467
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,077
I will very soon.

468
00:40:28,077 --> 00:40:32,800
I dropped by with these documents for Boss to sign.

469
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,873
There have been so many projects recently, and many documents are awaiting approval.

470
00:40:37,873 --> 00:40:40,950
I guess our boss must be exhausted.

471
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,106
Is he always like this?

472
00:40:45,106 --> 00:40:49,413
Always! If his work is not done, he will never go back home.

473
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:53,246
I'm afraid he will collapse one day.

474
00:40:53,246 --> 00:40:56,226
Anyway, please take care of these documents for me.

475
00:40:56,226 --> 00:40:57,653
Sure. I'll manage them for you.

476
00:40:57,653 --> 00:40:59,030
Go home safely. See you.

477
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,290
Yes. See you.

478
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,333
I'll leave the documents that you have to sign here.

479
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,666
Can you not go?

480
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:59,450
Boss,

481
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:04,040
I don't want to go back on my words with the client.

482
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:08,260
I'm not at a point where I can reject either.

483
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,300
You can, but you just don't.

484
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:19,830
It's nearly my appointment time now.

485
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,750
I'll send you off.

486
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,920
It's all right. I can go by myself.

487
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,460
Why?

488
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,433
I don't want you to do anything for me anymore.

489
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:15,430
Didn't you say that you got off work at 6?

490
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,860
I've been waiting for half an hour.

491
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,436
I'm sorry. I had an ongoing task to manage.

492
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,320
What was it?

493
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,036
Why are you looking so depressed? Did your boss scold you?

494
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,993
Anyway, it's nearly our reservation time.

495
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:39,493
Let's go.

496
00:43:44,986 --> 00:43:46,850
What are you doing?

497
00:43:47,474 --> 00:43:49,633
I'm walking you to the car.

498
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,140
I can go on my own. It's all right.

499
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,180
This car, right?

500
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,513
<i>It looks like your boss is not happy that you're with me.</i>

501
00:44:36,513 --> 00:44:40,173
<i>I'm just his employee, nothing more.</i>

502
00:44:40,173 --> 00:44:45,600
<i>I wonder why Akitsuki Koji is so interested in you.</i>

503
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:12,490
♫ <i>Even though I love you more than anyone else</i> ♫

504
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:19,680
♫ <i>I don't know why I didn't dare say it</i> ♫

505
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,650
♫ <i>Although you're the only one who loves me the most</i> ♫

506
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:33,840
♫ <i>I didn't let you know or assure you</i> ♫

507
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,400
♫ <i>To someone who isn't good enough</i> ♫

508
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,000
♫ <i>Someone who disappointed you</i> ♫

509
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,180
♫ <i>Would you be able to forgive them?</i> ♫

510
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,840
♫ <i>One thing that I just realized</i> ♫
