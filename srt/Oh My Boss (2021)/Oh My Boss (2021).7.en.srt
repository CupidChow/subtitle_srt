1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,700
<i>You're dating him for personal gain, right?</i>

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,366
<i>I do not think that way.</i>

3
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:07,640
<i>It's rare to find someone sincere.</i>

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,000
<i>What does that have to do with me?</i>

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,010
<i>Getting close to you is difficult, and that's what makes it interesting.</i>

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,480
<i>Khun Ploy, your behavior is inappropriate.</i>

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,010
<i>Nong Noom Nim's behavior is untrustworthy.</i>

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,510
<i>Ever since she started working here, she has caused problems.</i>

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,040
<i>But I'm now working with Khun Mark. You should be pleased.</i>

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,200
<i>Of course, it's what you do best.</i>

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,626
<i>I told you to let go of me. Please let go.</i>

12
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:36,840
<i>I paid you to work, not to play around.</i>

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,593
<i>Is the workload too much these days?</i>

14
00:00:38,593 --> 00:00:40,593
<i>It's not good to overexert yourself, or you'll get sick just like Boss.</i>

15
00:00:40,593 --> 00:00:42,320
<i>Don't you know that Boss is sick?</i>

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,986
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

17
00:00:43,986 --> 00:00:46,493
<i>Yesterday he worked too hard and knocked himself out.</i>

18
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:48,173
<i>So he's not coming in today.</i>

19
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:54,040
<i>Right now, he's alone with no one to take care of him. Thank you, Noom Nim-chan.</i>

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,100
<i>- Hi, Boss.
- Hi</i>

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,830
<i>Please don't do that.</i>

22
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,700
<i>Here!</i>

23
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:05,958
<i>Please sign the documents quickly</i>

24
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,542
<i>so you can get some rest</i>

25
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:10,500
<i>Do I make you feel that uncomfortable?</i>

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,310
<i>Something else makes me uncomfortable.</i>

27
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:19,110
<i>I may not have told you, but you're really good at your job.</i>

28
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,240
<i>Isn't this Koji's room?</i>

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,390
<i>Take off your shirt. I'll give you a tepid sponge bath.</i>

30
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,610
<i>You haven't told me what you're doing in Bangkok.</i>

31
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:42,150
<i>[Boss, Please Don't Flirt | Oh My Boss]</i>

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,290
‎♫ <i>Do you think you're the only one who feels this way</i> ♫

33
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,240
‎♫ <i>What you feel in your heart</i> ♫

34
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,460
‎♫ <i>Do you think that I don't feel the same</i> ♫

35
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,220
‎♫ <i>Is it okay to only think like that</i> ♫

36
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,270
‎‎♫ <i>Why are you keeping it to yourself</i> ♫

37
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:23,420

♫ <i>I can't see clearly if you love me or if you're just lonely</i> ♫

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,380
Why are there still three budgets that haven't been closed out?

40
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,100
And why are there only headings for deferred costs?

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,650
You haven't summarized the total expenses! Budget close-out is drawing near!

42
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,840
<i>Oh!</i>

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,781
<i>Come in.</i>

44
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,093
<i>Meow. Have you gone to bed? What are you doing?</i>

45
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:06,140
<i>I'm putting on a face mask. I'm going to bed soon.</i>

46
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,610
<i>I'm exhausted today. What's up?</i>

47
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,660
<i>It's nothing. Just go to bed. Sweet dreams.</i>

48
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,713
<i>Pinnnn, what are you doing? Are you sleeping yet?</i>

49
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:23,093
<i>I can't sleep. I really want to see you guys.</i>

50
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,300
<i>(T/N: She deletes her message, "I can't sleep. I really want to see you guys.")</i>

51
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,506
There are still three budgets that haven't been closed out yet. And the cost of goods sold...

52
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:49,430
It's deferred costs,

53
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,930
not the cost of goods sold.

54
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,460
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,233
There are still three budgets that haven't been closed out yet.

56
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:06,013
Why are there only headings for deferred costs?

57
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,926
We are still waiting for the original copies of all documents,

58
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:10,586
so we can't close out the budgets yet.

59
00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:12,753
The Revenue Department examines our documents strictly.

60
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,357
They didn't allow us to use any online copies.

61
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:19,080
Regarding deferred costs, we've just had our new office building expanded,

62
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,767
so we are working on the documents now.

63
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,657
- We are waiting for the documents...
- Do not speak!

64
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:27,180
I understand now.

65
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,670
No more topics to clarify, right?

66
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,040
Is there anyone who wants to clarify anything else?

67
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,640
Then please leave now.

68
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,400
It's the end of the meeting.

69
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,133
Hold on! You stay.

70
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,410
- She interpreted incorrectly.
- Usually, she doesn't...

71
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,584
If you lack capability, you don't have to come here.

72
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:12,180
You should instead do other easy jobs that require no brains.

73
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,494
Usually, she's never made such mistakes.

74
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:19,364
You're too impatient and didn't give her time to interpret.

75
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,730
I apologize. I will improve myself.

76
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,420
It's good that you still know how to accept your faults.

77
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:40,265
Koji-san, I really miss Thai food.

78
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:44,040
Can you take me to the restaurant we went to last time?

79
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,860
Sure.

80
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,320
Noom Nim-san, please come with us.

81
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,711
I'm feeling unwell today. I want to head home.

82
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,337
That's too bad.

83
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:03,400
It's all right. I guess I'll have to go with just Koiji-san.

84
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,195
Next time, please let me treat you to a meal. Okay?

85
00:06:09,195 --> 00:06:11,360
- Yes.
- Let's go.

86
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,367
Nong Nim, what's wrong? Did you get scolded?

87
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:46,640
Yes.

88
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,273
It looks like it was pretty serious.

89
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:51,591
Let's not bother her then.

90
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:09,682
Koji-san.

91
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,419
Let's try this one.

92
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,365
It looks good on you.

93
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,949
I don't really like wearing them.

94
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:27,388
You don't like wearing them, but you should if they look good on you.

95
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:29,762
Come on. I will tie it for you.

96
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:47,546
Handsome.

97
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:49,878
Very handsome.

98
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:53,610
What do you think? He looks good, doesn't he?

99
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,765
Are you feeling better now?

100
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,800
Since you already look good now, let's get back to work.

101
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:03,359
Please help me throw this thing away.

102
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,372
What's wrong with her?

103
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:25,492
I don't know, either, but it seems serious.

104
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,841
Nim! That's enough.

105
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:35,050
Did you get possessed by Lamyong? You finished two bottles.
<i>(T/N: Lamyong is an alcoholic woman from a series called "Thong Nuea Kao")</i>

106
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,844
Ever since you learned how to drink, you've been chugging them.

107
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,840
Pinn...

108
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,979
what has happened to her?

109
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,540
If I have to guess, I think she's heartbroken.

110
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:54,779
How could I? I don't even have a boyfriend.

111
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,023
By your boss.

112
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:59,523
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Right?

113
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:03,872
Do you mean that foolish guy?

114
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:07,325
He's just flirty with everyone. He is not serious about anyone!

115
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:08,722
Really?

116
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:11,450
Why doesn't he flirt with me either?

117
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:16,096
I thought that he was interested in you.

118
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,819
And recently, a woman has been throwing herself at him.

119
00:09:21,632 --> 00:09:24,849
But it's good. They make a perfect match.

120
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,482
I want to see that woman's face,

121
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:30,812
to see how much prettier she is compared to our friend.

122
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:32,555
Right.

123
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:37,435
Oh my god!

124
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:42,262
This is like a scene from a drama. Speak of the devil!

125
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:51,040
At first, I thought she was sick. I guess she was just bored and didn't want to work.

126
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,359
Where are you going?

127
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,829
I'm going to go ask her.

128
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,653
Since she's here drinking with friends, I guess she's fine now.

129
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:05,602
Plus, this is her private time.

130
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:09,726
If you bother her now, that might seem unprofessional.

131
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:11,706
Don't you think so?

132
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,239
Let's find our table instead.

133
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,519
- Guys, let me take my words back.
- Why?

134
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,812
She is more beautiful than Nim.

135
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,020
Hey. Wow!

136
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,352
- Calm down. Nim.
- That's enough.

137
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:40,645
That's enough already. Why are you drinking so much?

138
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:42,869
Order one more for me.

139
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,729
One more bottle, please.

140
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,730
Give me the bottles. I'll put them away.

141
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,436
Cheers!

142
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:13,764
Get a hold of yourself. Come to your senses.

143
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:16,853
Job-san has something to say.

144
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:19,232
I would like to let you know

145
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:25,279
it's an honor for me that Khun Koji-san and Khun Rena-san came to meet me today. I'm very pleased.

146
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,103
I'm exceptionally glad to meet Khun Rena-san here.

147
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:33,385
You have been our client for so long.

148
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:39,039
Since I'm here in Thailand, I must greet our important client myself.

149
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:44,327
It's because you two speak so sweetly that I enjoy negotiating business with your company.

150
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:52,589
Thank you very much. We are extremely delighted that you like us.

151
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:55,969
By the way, when will you two have good news?

152
00:11:57,689 --> 00:12:01,449
Job-san, we're just partners.

153
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,020
I thought that your relationship status had changed.

154
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,149
Come on, Khun Koji-san. Khun Rena-san is so gorgeous.

155
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,999
How can you let her be just your partner?

156
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:19,004
If I were you, I would have declared my rights already.

157
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,559
Oh, there is a pool table here. I want to play.

158
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,299
Accompany me, please.

159
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:35,414
Please?

160
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:36,906
Let's go.

161
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,923
- Please excuse me.
- Please enjoy yourself.

162
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:43,553
Come on.

163
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,290
Okay.

164
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,363
Before you start the game, you must do this.

165
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:00,449
- Like this?
- Right.

166
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,063
- Okay.
- Okay.

167
00:13:06,063 --> 00:13:09,523
- I'll show you.
- Will you teach me what to do?

168
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,084
Like this.

169
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,850
Place your hand here like this.

170
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,520
- Your hand should be like this.
- Oh, wow.

171
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,743
She said she didn't know how to play, but look at how she stretches her legs like a pro.

172
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:24,969
I thought that was Tong Sit Choi!
<i>(T/N: Thai professional snooker player)</i>

173
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:27,209
She thinks she's slick.

174
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,620
Shoot it firmly.

175
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,980
Shoot firmly? Okay.

176
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,020
Okay. That's good.

177
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,720
- Is it?
- Don't look.

178
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,580
Steady your hand.

179
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,449
I didn't hit it at all.

180
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:52,360
She doesn't look like someone who would say such things.

181
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,661
She looks like a cat that is about to regurgitate. I want to throw up!

182
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,289
That's true.

183
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:03,585
She's trying so hard to flirt. I want to throw a pool ball at her.

184
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:05,969
Go ahead. Take your pick of balls.

185
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,459
Hi, there. Hi, there.

186
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:12,459
What's your name?

187
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,059
Yes.

188
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:25,433
Just throw it at her.

189
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:28,356
Throw it right into her face!

190
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:32,642
Go for it. Right into her face! Go ahead.

191
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,620
Her name is Nim. Cheers!

192
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,430
Let's cheer.

193
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,499
Koji!

194
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:01,005
- Hey, what the hell?
- Noom Nim-san, we need to talk.

195
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:03,382
What is it? Let go.

196
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:06,779
- Let go of me!
- Nim!

197
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,462
- Let me go!
- I won't.

198
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:13,889
Boss, I told you to let go of me. I'm going back inside.

199
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,808
- I'll get out of here.
- Stay still,

200
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:23,810
if you don't want me to do more than this.

201
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,810
I thought you said you were sick.

202
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,450
Why are you here?

203
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,172
I took some medicine, and I felt better.

204
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:45,229
My friends invited me here so I joined them.

205
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:48,699
Do you think I will believe what you said?

206
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:56,599
You weren't actually sick, right?

207
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:00,406
That's right.

208
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,339
I lied to you.

209
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,929
Is this what you want to talk to me about?

210
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:09,409
No.

211
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:12,609
That's just the first thing,

212
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:15,319
but another one is about you behaving inappropriately when drunk.

213
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:17,580
"Behaving inappropriately while drunk"?

214
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:20,939
How was I acting inappropriately?

215
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,129
I'm just here partying with my friends.

216
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:26,769
I'm just having a bit of fun. What's wrong with that?

217
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,549
If it's just a bit, I have no problem with that,

218
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:35,529
but you lied to me and sneaked out to drink.

219
00:16:36,476 --> 00:16:39,419
How should I handle you?

220
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,429
You have no right to do this to me.

221
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,819
You're able to be involved with Rena-san.

222
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,199
What are you laughing at?

223
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,339
I understand now.

224
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:02,799
So that's how it is.

225
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:05,929
Understand?

226
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:10,582
What do you understand? Do you know what I'm thinking?

227
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:15,849
I don't know what you're thinking,

228
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:21,569
but it will be my understanding that you're jealous because of me.

229
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:28,301
We are not in any relationship. Why would I be jealous?

230
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:30,209
I'm not.

231
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:38,909
I just don't like it.

232
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,599
I don't like it when you act unpredictable.

233
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,236
Sometimes, you pay attention to me, but then you become indifferent.

234
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:01,329
I don't know how I should behave anymore.

235
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,876
And you also don't like seeing me with Rena, right?

236
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,313
Yes.

237
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:12,009
I mean no.

238
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,721
Let me tell you something.

239
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:24,519
Rena-san and I are nothing more than friends.

240
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,679
I will send you home.

241
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,665
Next time, if you're curious about anything, just ask.

242
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:36,849
Don't imagine things on your own.

243
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:04,592
Nezumi-san, hold on!

244
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,270
Nezumi-san.

245
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,609
I already told you.

246
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:15,769
If you're curious about anything, just ask.

247
00:19:21,449 --> 00:19:23,140
I'm curious.

248
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,680
About what?

249
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:30,149
Do friends kiss each other?

250
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:33,579
Kiss? What kiss?

251
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,799
You and Rena-san.

252
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:46,009
I wasn't kissing her.

253
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:51,939
<i>Does she make coffee to your liking?</i>

254
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,009
<i>It's good.</i>

255
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:02,522
<i>What are you doing?</i>

256
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:04,797
<i>I'm tidying up your clothes.</i>

257
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:33,895
<i>Please don't do this again.</i>

258
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:39,883
<i>Why can't I? When you belong to me.</i>

259
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:45,370
<i>Just because I treat you well,</i>

260
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:50,030
<i>that doesn't mean I am yours.</i>

261
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,759
<i>I know her feelings toward me, but I never thought that way with her.</i>

262
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,868
Is that so?

263
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:14,559
Is everything cleared up?

264
00:21:17,622 --> 00:21:19,722
Yes.

265
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:25,689
I will only kiss the person I want to kiss.

266
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:34,109

280
00:22:56,209 --> 00:23:01,990
<i>I will only kiss the person I want to kiss.</i>

281
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,450
Only the working days are still available.

282
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,841
Understood.

283
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,423
Okay, I'll call Fujisaki-san.

284
00:23:20,423 --> 00:23:23,312
In the meantime, please find a suitable venue.

285
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:28,364
Please interpret.

286
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,428
Yes.

287
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:42,647
Kamei-san mentioned that Kireiro would like to postpone the launch event,

288
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,039
but the venue is fully booked until next month. Only weekday slots are available.

289
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,478
Koji-san will discuss this with Mr. Fujikaki first.

290
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:56,810
Meanwhile, Kamei-san will try to find alternative venues.

291
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,569
Okay. That's all for today. We'll finish here.

292
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,370
<i>Concentrate, Nezumi.</i>

293
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:30,066
<i>It's because of you.</i>

294
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:40,113
<i>Make me a cup of coffee. Make it really sweet.</i>

295
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,813
<i>Hurry. I want to see you.</i>

296
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:52,787
Noom Nim.

297
00:24:57,753 --> 00:24:59,353
Yes?

298
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,360
P'In, do you want me to bring these documents for Khun Mark to sign?

299
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,155
That's right. It's just an employment contract and a bid submission.

300
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:19,300
It's not difficult, right? Please let him sign them.

301
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,580
Why does it have to be me?

302
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:29,335
Well, his secretary called me this morning

303
00:25:29,335 --> 00:25:33,922
and said that they wanted the original documents and not scanned copies.

304
00:25:33,922 --> 00:25:37,876
So I thought that you would be able to help, right?

305
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,335
But it's still not related to me.

306
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,999
Why don't you go yourself, P'In?

307
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,980
Actually,

308
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,530
these documents should have been signed since last time,

309
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:59,015
but Khun Mark just phoned me earlier this morning,

310
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:03,131
saying that if the person who brings these documents to him is not you,

311
00:26:03,131 --> 00:26:05,342
he won't sign them.

312
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:10,685
What? What is up with him now?

313
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:14,761
Exactly. But you can understand me, right,

314
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:17,679
that I've been working on this project for so long.

315
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,799
I presented the proposal and came up with the concept.

316
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:24,189
I give this project my all, and so does my whole team.

317
00:26:24,189 --> 00:26:27,580
This project is big, and the budget is large.

318
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:33,149
I won't let these reasons ruin it. Do you understand me?

319
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,384
I understand, but—

320
00:26:37,384 --> 00:26:40,872
Nong Nim, please don't rush to decline yet.

321
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:42,532
Please help me first.

322
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:45,145
Please help me this one time. This is my last favor.

323
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:50,819
I won't ask you to help me anymore. I'm begging you.

324
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:54,799
Or do you want to see Boss' company get ruined?

325
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,054
Here's your coffee.

326
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:27,609
It's bitter.

327
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,570
Still? I added quite a bit of sugar.

328
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,019
Try it yourself.

329
00:27:54,647 --> 00:27:57,197
It is sweet, though.

330
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,219
This is sweeter.

331
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:07,819
Boss!

332
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,459
It's punishment for being late.

333
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,279
Are you shy?

334
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,499
Should I do it more often so you won't be shy?

335
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:36,570
I have something to consult you about.

336
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,430
What is it?

337
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,520
What have you been doing? It's nearly our appointment time with the client.

338
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,987
You're his secretary, but why don't you remind him?

339
00:28:46,987 --> 00:28:49,693
I'm lost for words.

340
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:51,659
Okay.

341
00:28:52,854 --> 00:28:55,923
Nim-san, what were you going to say?

342
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,840
It's nothing.

343
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,322
I was about to tell you that I've already finished translating all the slides.

344
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:10,558
I already sent them to the creative team as well as the marketing team.

345
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,654
You'd better hurry now, or else the client will be waiting for you.

346
00:29:14,892 --> 00:29:16,441
Okay.

347
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:33,479
Here you are.

348
00:29:35,699 --> 00:29:37,939
I never understood...

349
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,279
why you always look so bored when you come to see me.

350
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,495
You are our company's client.

351
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,801
I have no right to make a bored face in front of you.

352
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:56,780
Does that mean that if you had the right, you would look bored?

353
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,200
If you're not okay with this, you can go home.

354
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,833
All I'll do is just not sign these documents.

355
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,797
I won't be afflicted, even if I don't sign them.

356
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,505
But the upcoming projects,

357
00:30:19,505 --> 00:30:25,087
as well as trustworthiness for the client, will all be affected.

358
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:28,831
I won't be able to take any responsibility for that.

359
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,560
I've brought the documents for you to sign as you asked.

360
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,492
Please sign them for me.

361
00:30:37,492 --> 00:30:39,570
Are you in a hurry?

362
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,470
Or do you have an appointment with someone?

363
00:30:43,144 --> 00:30:48,639
Or are you just afraid that Akitsuki-san will be upset that you're having dinner with me?

364
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,749
Ting?

365
00:30:57,609 --> 00:30:59,092
Yes, Boss.

366
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:01,122
Did you see Nim-san?

367
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,219
Why are you avoiding my eyes?

368
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,617
What's your answer?

369
00:31:07,656 --> 00:31:11,369
She brought documents for Khun Mark to sign.

370
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,099
Brought documents for Khun Mark to sign?

371
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:20,169
But this is not her job. Who asked her to do it?

372
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,349
There she is.

373
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,752
What did you ask my secretary to do? And where is she now?

374
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:56,459
Khun Nim, let me tell you this.

375
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:59,900
Akitsuki-san is a womanizer.

376
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,230
He's not interested in you.

377
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,896
We are just an employer and an employee.

378
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,056
You don't have to lie.

379
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:15,035
It's obvious to me that you want more than that.

380
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:18,319
Just admit it. It's not a big deal.

381
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,605
If you aren't signing them, please excuse me.

382
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:27,306
Hold on.

383
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,531
I didn't tell you to leave yet.

384
00:32:31,654 --> 00:32:33,875
I haven't finished what I was saying.

385
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,345
Hold on!

386
00:32:39,345 --> 00:32:44,039
I told you I haven't finished talking. You don't have any right to do this.

387
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,362
You don't have the right to do this, either!

388
00:32:46,362 --> 00:32:48,414
Don't I?

389
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:54,219
Let go of me! Let go of me!

390
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,930


391
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,439
You don't have any right to do this to any woman!

392
00:33:12,076 --> 00:33:13,916
What were you going to do?

393
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:19,649
If anything happens to me, your company won't end well!

394
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,345
I don't care.

395
00:33:21,345 --> 00:33:23,909
Don't touch my woman!

396
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,979
Come here.

397
00:33:35,634 --> 00:33:37,339
Boss!

398
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:42,497
I... I-I'm sorry—

399
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:45,058
You must be more careful.

400
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:52,809
If I found out later than this, do you know what could have happened?

401
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:58,419
I'm sorry for putting you in trouble,

402
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:01,719
but Khun Mark proposed a condition.

403
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:06,029
He said that if I didn't come, he would not sign the contract with us.

404
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:11,200
If he proposes a despicable condition, you must reject it.

405
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,991
Learn to say no.

406
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:22,419
If his condition says that you must die, will you do that?

407
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:27,749
But I did reject already.

408
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:35,865
He still insisted that if I didn't come, the project would be ruined.

409
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:40,059
I don't want my teammates to lose this project because of me.

410
00:34:40,736 --> 00:34:42,730
Besides,

411
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,360
I didn't know that... he would do such things.

412
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:53,930
I scolded you because I'm worried about you.

413
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,419
Yes.

414
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,873
I truly worry about you, Nezumi-san.

415
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:21,679
Nezumi-san,

416
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:25,019
will you be my girlfriend?

417
00:35:37,689 --> 00:35:39,089
Yes.

418
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,596
That's it?

419
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,709
Please kindly take care of me from now on.

420
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,919
<i>Noom Nim, those Japanese bosses can't be trusted.</i>

421
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:34,032
<i>You should be careful and behave yourself.</i>

422
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:36,125
<i>Don't get too close to your boss.</i>

423
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:39,399
<i>You seem a bit tense whenever you're with me, Nim-san.</i>

424
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,025
<i>I'm going to ask you directly.</i>

425
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:42,619
<i>You and Koji are dating now, aren't you?</i>

426
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,805
<i>Do you know him well enough?</i>

427
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:47,972
<i>There are so many things you don't know about him.</i>

428
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:52,252
<i>Koji is more dangerous than you think.</i>

429
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:55,512
<i>You're more serious about her than I thought.</i>

430
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,672
<i>Did you forget about us already?</i>

431
00:36:59,672 --> 00:37:02,489
<i>I met Akitsuki's woman already.</i>

432
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:06,552
<i>Relax. She's just an ordinary girl.</i>

433
00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:09,112
<i>You can't even handle a simple girl.</i>

434
00:37:09,112 --> 00:37:11,112
<i>That means you've been living in Thailand for a while now, right?</i>

435
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:12,139
<i>I go back sometimes.</i>

436
00:37:12,139 --> 00:37:14,579
<i>- Who do you go back to?
- Your wife and children?</i>

437
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:17,529
<i>Tonight was so much fun, but I must get going.</i>

438
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:20,365
<i>He has to go take care of his work. It's urgent.</i>

439
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,639
<i>What work is that?</i>

440
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,459
<i>You're his secretary. Do you know what it is?</i>

441
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:25,019
<i>Yes, tell us.</i>

442
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:26,752
<i>What are you doing?</i>

443
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:28,652
<i>Someone could come in.</i>

444
00:37:28,652 --> 00:37:30,612
<i>Are you still angry?</i>

445
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:52,970
♫ <i>Even though I love you more than anyone else</i> ♫

446
00:37:52,970 --> 00:38:00,090
♫ <i>I don't know why I didn't dare say it</i> ♫
