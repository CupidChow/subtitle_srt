1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,980
   

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,820


3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,850
 Today is Hyeong Seop's birthday. 
   

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,720
 Let's drink. Bring presents. 

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,250
   

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,820
 Hey, isn't this the dim sum place? 

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,260
 You don't even pay. Don't be picky. Just come. 

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,240
 Don't forget the cake. 

9
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,700
No, don't get out. It's raining too.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,740
- But still— 
 - I'm really okay.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,310
Thank you for making time for me.

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,440
No, I should be thanking you.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,760
Give me a call. I'll be waiting.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,170
Okay. Drive safely.

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,680
Yes, get home safely.

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,530
Bye, Nuna.

17
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,650
Take care.

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,140
Why? Why?

19
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,770
Relationships can go stale for a bit. You can't break up for that.

20
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,340
Jeong Hyeon Seong, you think you can meet someone like Seong Ok?

21
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,010
Kneel and beg for forgiveness right now!

22
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,570
He doesn't know how lucky he is.

23
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,170
You're not successful or anything.

24
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,910
You should be thanking Seong Ok for dating you.

25
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,910
It's not like she cheated on you or anything.

26
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,160
It's your fault, unless she is at fault.

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,840
Did you say "cheat" just now? Don't you know Ok?

28
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,170
She hasn't even looked at another man for seven years.

29
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,270
Am I wrong, Ok?

30
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,410
Han Seong Ok.

31
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,570
You didn't, right?

32
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,030
To be honest, I...

33
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,420
To be honest, I—

34
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,710
I did it.

35
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,310
I cheated.

36
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,590
I slept with another woman.

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,600
Hey, was it that day...

38
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,040
You son of a bitch.

39
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,160
Han Seong Ok!

40
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,510
 Seong Ok. 

41
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,270
 Han Seong Ok. 

42
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,320
 Are you okay? 

43
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,720
 Gosh, seriously. 

44
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,790
 I think... 

45
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,760
 there was somewhere nice nearby. 

46
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,470
 Hey, you're awake. 

47
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,340
 Where are we? 

48
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,650
 You were too drunk. So we're at a motel nearby. 

49
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,500
 - Do you want to shower first? 
 - Pardon? 

50
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,100
 What's wrong? Hey, Seong Ok. 

51
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,920
 You're sure you're okay, right? 

52
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,370
 You haven't sobered up yet. Let me drive you home. 

53
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,220
 What's going on, anyway? 

54
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,510
 I wanted to pretend like it was okay and nothing happened. 

55
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,220
 I thought I could. 

56
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,980
 In the short moment, I made eye contact with her, 

57
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,550
 I could understand without any explanation. 

58
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,480
 We just pretended like we didn't. 

59
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:51,090
 Did the seven years together pull us apart? 

60
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,420
 We had reached the end without realizing it. 

61
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,480
   

62
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,460
I'll get going.

63
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,210
Okay, I'll wrap things up.

64
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,070
Hey, Oh Fatty!

65
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,030
Kim Hye Ryeong?

66
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,500
You were eating here, too. My buddy.

67
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,130
Are you crazy? Why are you hugging me?

68
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,660
Hey, this isn't appropriate right now.

69
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,060
Why not?

70
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,330
- Are you drunk? 
 - Yes, I am.

71
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,770
It's so nice to run into each other, isn't it?

72
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,170
Things are serious in there. Let's get out. Hurry.

73
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,080
Why? Grab another drink with me, Oh Fatty!

74
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,680
Let's have another one.

75
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,530
Please?

76
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,990
Oh Fatty, let's get another drink. Please.

77
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,620
♫  There are so many stories I want to tell you  ♫

78
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,110
 Let's just have one drink. Please? 

79
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,890
 Just one drink, please? 

80
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:24,190
♫  Keep my lips sealed... Ah-choo!  ♫

81
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,820
♫  So many stories I want to tell you  ♫

82
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:36,240
♫  I can hardly keep my lips sealed  ♫

83
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,550
♫  Ah-choo ~ I think I have pollen in my heart.  ♫

84
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,040
 Oh Fatty, let's get another drink. Please. 

85
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,110
 Please. Please? 

86
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,730
 Oh Fatty, please. 

87
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,690
I'm crazy.

88
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,490
Yes, I am.

89
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm crazy. I'm crazy. I'm crazy!

90
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,140
Does heart disease run in my family?

91
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,170
Calm down.

92
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
My eyes are closing...

93
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,820
 I used to like you. 

94
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,250
 I must have lost my mind. 

95
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,610
 I know I don't have anyone else, but why Kim Hye Ryeong? 

96
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,520
Why all of a sudden?

97
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,140
There's a bit of a situation.

98
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,520
Aigoo, look at me. I don't know how to read the air.

99
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,370
You're moving in with your boyfriend, aren't you?

100
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,750
Yes. I'm glad you're doing this.

101
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,640
I told you from the beginning.

102
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,010
You live in the same neighborhood. Why live separately?

103
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,340
You don't get criticized for living together these days. In this day and age.

104
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,030
Should I talk to your boyfriend and look for a bigger place for you?

105
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,660
No.

106
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,100
Why not?

107
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,200
That place must be small for two people.

108
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,430
We broke up.

109
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,480
   

110
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,550
Time always moves along.

111
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,990
 Did you actually wear that? It was from Si Hu, right? 

112
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,250
 Wow, I got to hand it to you. 

113
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,880
 I'm glad you guys are laughing, at least. 

114
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,420
 A baby saw me and cried earlier. 

115
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,710
 Laugh if it's funny, Jeong Hyeon Seong. 

116
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,770
   

117
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,410
   

118
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,060
   

119
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,640
He is alive.

120
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,050
Gosh, Kim Hyeong Seop is so crazy.

121
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,800
   

122
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,110
   

123
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,120
 She's a female friend I have no feelings for. 

124
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,850
 It's normal to feel excited even if I don't like her, right? 

125
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,020
 My heart fluttered for a hot second. I swear that's all there is. 

126
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,240
 I really don't think I like her. 

127
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,370
 That can happen momentarily, right? 

128
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,230
Geez!

129
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,530
Everyone will say it's nothing.

130
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,610
Seriously.

131
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,090
 Are you seriously asking this? Have you never dated? 

132
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,110
 - He's already in love.  
 - What?

133
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,170
 So you're saying you have a female friend you have feelings for. 

134
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,320
What are they saying?

135
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,720
 Book a wedding venue. 

136
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,550
 Oh Fatty? 

137
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,240
What?

138
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,150
What?

139
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,260
   

140
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,710
 Hey. What's up, Jjang Ji? 

141
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,730
Come to Grill Grill after work.

142
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,940
I don't feel like it.

143
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,850
 What do you mean, you don't feel like it? 

144
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,160
By chance...

145
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,040
is Kim Hye Ryeong coming, too?

146
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,880
Why? You won't come if she's not coming?

147
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,620
I-I won't go if she's coming.

148
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,470
I won't go if she's coming. I won't go, okay?

149
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,380
Bu Ri, is Hye Ryeong joining us tonight?

150
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,260
I don't know. She hasn't responded yet.

151
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,710
Looks like she isn't.

152
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,500
Really?

153
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,850
What? Is something going on between you and her?

154
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,160
What are you...

155
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,540
What are you talking about? How could there be?

156
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,550
 Anyway, we'll be expecting you, then. 

157
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,620
Hey, Jjang Ji. I'm not going. I'm...

158
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,930
I'm not going! I'm not going!

159
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,640
Seong Ok, are you really leaving?

160
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,540
Yes.

161
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,240
Thank you for everything, Manager.

162
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,060
You'll do well wherever you go.

163
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,860
Please forgive me if I hurt you somehow.

164
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,930
I will.

165
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,100
You'll be in touch, right?

166
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,860
Yes.

167
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,960
Thank you for everything.

168
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,720
Take care. Be well.

169
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,400
Okay.

170
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,240
Another one's leaving.

171
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,500
Okay.

172
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,890
Let's see if we got any orders.

173
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,110
   

174
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,870
Not even... Not even... Not even one.

175
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,740
Should I look for a part-time job?

176
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,850
   

177
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,180
Delivery. Load and unload.

178
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,720
Geez. I've never done that before.

179
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,610
Something else.

180
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,540
   

181
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,330
Kitchen assistant? Clean-cut type?

182
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,870
I'll have to get a haircut. No, no.

183
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,300
Seop Seop*... 
  (Nickname for Hyeong Seop, it also means "sad" or "disappointed") 

184
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,730
Hello? It's me.

185
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,070
Are you guys hiring a part-timer, by chance?

186
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,940
 Why? Does someone want to? 

187
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,320
- I want to. 
 - We're already done hiring.

188
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,300
- When? 
  - Not long ago. 

189
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,920
 What makes you want to wait tables all of a sudden? 

190
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,370
By the way, are you okay? Do you want to get a drink?

191
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,540
 Hey, drink, my foot. 

192
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,400
Hang up if you won't hire me.

193
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,660
That's a relief, then. Talk to you later.

194
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,560
   

195
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,840
   

196
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,680
   

197
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
   

198
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,960
She doesn't post photos,

199
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,700
but she liked my post.

200
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:57,320
   

201
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,530
   

202
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,870
If you're free... If you're free...

203
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,970
would you...

204
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,170
 She's my girlfriend, Han Seong Ok. 

205
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,450
 You've got to be kidding. 

206
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,290
 - Hello. 
 - Hello. 

207
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,970
 - Be formal. Be formal. 
 - Hello! 

208
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,140
 Nice to meet you. 

209
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,540
 - Are you jealous? 
 - Gosh, I'm so jealous. 

210
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,800
 - Oh... 
 - Seriously. 

211
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,570
 Thank you. 

212
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,080
 You guys should start dating, too. 

213
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,450
 Should we talk casually? 

214
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,490
 Yes, okay. 

215
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,710
 Are you serious? 

216
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,330
 The dim sums are so good here. 

217
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,230
 Can I come again sometime? 

218
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,140
 Yes, of course, you can. 

219
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,920
 Uncle! Get us ten more baskets of shrimp dim sum. 

220
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,660
 All right! Ten baskets of shrimp dim sum. 

221
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,290
 How did you know I like shrimp? 

222
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,490
 You're so observant. 

223
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,620
 You must be popular, right? 

224
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,610
 Not really. 

225
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,040
 What's this? What are you guys talking about? 

226
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,860
 It's a secret between Hyeong Seop and me. 

227
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,570
 What? What's going on? 

228
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,650
 What is this, a soap opera? 

229
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,110
 Did you guys get close that quickly? 

230
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,790
 Yes. He and I have a lot in common. 

231
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,110
 Well, I mean... 

232
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,080
 What? Hyeong Seop's face is about to explode. 

233
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,380
 Gosh, you are forever single. 

234
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,600
 Hey, your ears are totally red. 

235
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,220
 Hey, you're forever single. 

236
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,420
 Your ears are red. 

237
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,480
 They're seriously red. 

238
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,490
 He sure is forever single. 

239
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,060
 - Why? 
 - He's been single for 20 years. 

240
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,000
Yes. It's not like I'm acting trashy.

241
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,760
Yes, Geon Yeop.

242
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,520
 You mean it, right? 

243
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,610
Yes, let's work together.

244
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,940
 Let's see. Let's have a welcoming party today. 

245
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,880
 Where are you? 

246
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,370
I'm doing something right now. I'm outside.

247
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,130
 Oh, really? 

248
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,040
 It'd be a shame to let a day like today go. 

249
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,730
I'll call you. Let's meet up soon.

250
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,420
 Okay, Nuna. Call me. 

251
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,260
Okay.

252
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,570
It's hard enough to tell all of my friends we broke up.

253
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,380
Did I have to tell the real estate agent, too?

254
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,940
That lady is seriously nosy.

255
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,090
Why are you looking at me?

256
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,770
I won't say anything anymore.

257
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,190
By the way, why are you suddenly moving?

258
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,220
It's not because of Jeong Hyeon Seong, right?

259
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,280
No. Not at all.

260
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,270
   

261
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,220
 Should we meet up if you're free? 

262
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,800
What?

263
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,000
- Are you still talking to "Are you sleeping" Oppa? 
 - No.

264
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,180
It's just a friend.

265
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,370
Hey. What if that Oppa thinks you guys started dating that night?

266
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,670
Give it to me. I'll take care of it.

267
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,940
You need to make things very clear with men.

268
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,050
It's Hyeong Seop.

269
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,170
Do you miss Hyeon Seong again?

270
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,380
No.

271
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,920
You're not trying to ask how he's doing through friends, right?

272
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,360
You're making me so sad.

273
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,370
It's not like that.

274
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,790
I quit my job.

275
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,750
So soon?

276
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,770
You've really been enduring your job for Hyeon Seong.

277
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,130
It's not like that.

278
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,940
I was actually offered a job as a designer.

279
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,880
What? Daebak!

280
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,300
Hey, why would you tell me that now? Where at?

281
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,770
They're called Jewelry A.

282
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,940
You probably won't know. It's a new company.

283
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,110
My hoobae works there as a merchandiser.

284
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,850
That's great.

285
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,600
Hey. Order whatever you want.

286
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,200
No, should we go somewhere else instead?

287
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,460
This must be good for me, right?

288
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,140
Of course, it is.

289
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,520
You're cool, Han Seong Ok.

290
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,780
Get a lot of experience there and launch Ok Jewelry later.

291
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,000
You know I'd be your model, right?

292
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,670
Yes.

293
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,200
Thank you.

294
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,500
When is Oh Fatty coming?

295
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,430
He said he won't come if you're here.

296
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,690
He's probably working.

297
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,490
We need him to grill meat perfectly.

298
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,410
He's best at grilling.

299
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,200
Did you gain weight?

300
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,670
Me?

301
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,820
What's this? Kim Hye Ryeong is here.

302
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,530
Oh? Oh Fatty is here.

303
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,420
I heard you said you won't come if I'm here.

304
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,080
Me? N-No, that's not true.

305
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,800
Are you mad at me about something?

306
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,380
I said it's not like that.

307
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,800
What? You're acting strange today, Pig.

308
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,720
There's really something going on.

309
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,250
I said it's not like that.

310
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,360
How could there be anything going on between me and her?

311
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,080
You'd better talk it out if something is going on.

312
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Because we need to drink together.

313
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,430
I don't know what's going on, but let's shake hands and move on.

314
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,670
L-Let's eat first.

315
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,960
Should we clank glasses?

316
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,130
Okay. Pour me some.

317
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,570
 Why is it so soft? 

318
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,510
Cheers!

319
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,770
Oh, right! Jjang Ji, check this out. I ate this at Sundae Town.

320
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,860
This is two servings?

321
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,790
That's crazy. We need to go.

322
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,360
Isn't it amazing?

323
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,990
Is eating all you ever think about?

324
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,950
Yes. Don't we work to feed ourselves?

325
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,430
What's more important than eating in this world?

326
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,520
Oh, I read this once somewhere.

327
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,960
Men have dirty thoughts as often as women think about food.

328
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,830
Do you have dirty thoughts that often?

329
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,190
How can you do everyday tasks?

330
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,860
That's what I want to ask you. Seriously.

331
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,260
Are you having a dirty thought right now?

332
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,040
What are you saying? I'm not, okay?

333
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,410
Gosh, don't be so messy.

334
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,850
It's tasty.

335
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,750
   

336
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,300
 Stop thinking about it and ask her directly. 

337
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,300
 Yes. It's your loss to hide your feelings. 

338
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,760
 You need to take action to win love. 

339
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,320
 I'd tell her rather than regretting later. 

340
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,880
Yes. Let's ask her.

341
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,020
Bu Ri, don't you want a cigarette break?

342
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,250
- I quit. 
 - What?

343
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,810
Really? Why?

344
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,770
The thing is...

345
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,570
I had a really passionate night with my girlfriend recently.

346
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,760
Gosh. Seriously?

347
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,840
We were talking about smoking. Why suddenly have dirty talk?

348
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,800
Just listen. I want to hear women's perspectives.

349
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,350
Okay. Go ahead.

350
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,220
I really liked it.

351
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,210
I thought my girlfriend liked it, too, since I worked at it. But...

352
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,130
She was counting patterns on the ceiling.

353
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,850
Geez.

354
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,020
That's why you quit smoking?

355
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,360
What does that have to do with your private part?

356
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,930
Of course, they're related, man.

357
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,070
Stop laughing!

358
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,680
I can't even suggest doing it since then.

359
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,380
I'm really serious. What should I do?

360
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,930
- You should break up. 
 - You should break up.

361
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,220
I'm an idiot for asking for relationship advice from singles.

362
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,230
Yes, you decide if you'd break up or not.

363
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,960
Hye Ryeong, l-let's talk for a second.

364
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,860
- Me? Why? 
 - Huh?

365
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,970
I mean, I'd like to talk to you for a second.

366
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,330
Right. I need to tell you something too.

367
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,780
 Is she talking about me? In front of everyone? 

368
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,990
Hey, what are you going to say? Save it for later. Later.

369
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,740
I...

370
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,840
- got a boyfriend. 
 - What?

371
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,570
 I got a boyfriend. 

372
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,490
I was going to tell you earlier, but I missed my timing.

373
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,800
Really? Boyfriend? You didn't tell me anything.

374
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,480
I missed my timing, I said.

375
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,500
Y-You? Kim Hye Ryeong is in a relationship?

376
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,210
- How many years has it been? 
 - How old is he?

377
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,440
Pig, aren't you curious?

378
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,300
Why are you quiet when I say I have a boyfriend?

379
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,280
What? Aren't you even interested?

380
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,440
Hey, Pig. Hey.

381
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,100
What?

382
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,330
I mean,

383
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,770
why should I care if you got a boyfriend or not?

384
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,090
Your face says you care a lot.

385
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,620
What are you saying? That's not true.

386
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,160
And do you guys believe her?

387
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,240
How could she have a boyfriend? She must be kidding.

388
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,850
You're right.

389
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,010
- Yes. 
 - This isn't the first time. She almost fooled me.

390
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,820
I'll have to show you, then.

391
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,880
See?

392
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,210
She was lying. How dare you bring a photo of a celebrity?

393
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,390
- Who's this? 
 - Is he an idol?

394
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,300
He's my boyfriend.

395
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,720
I wasn't going to show you this one.

396
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,710
Is it for real? Kim Hye Ryeong is dating someone like him?

397
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,250
No way.

398
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,870
It feels like a dream for me, too.

399
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,200
Hey. How come you aren't reacting at all?

400
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,430
Well, I mean...

401
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,710
- I guess it's true. 
 - Are you sure he likes you?

402
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,900
Has he asked for money or something?

403
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,710
- He hasn't, okay? 
 - How old is he?

404
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,310
He's 23. And...

405
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,580
He's a model.

406
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,610
Wow, he's tall, too?

407
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,410
Wow, life is so unfair.

408
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,110
Right? Isn't he amazing?

409
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,450
- No, I think it's fair. 
 - What do you mean?

410
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,150
He's tall, handsome, and young, but he has you as a girlfriend.

411
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,340
Thinking about it, god doesn't give you everything.

412
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,740
I'll kill you, okay?

413
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,640
No, no. There has to be something wrong with him.

414
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,510
He's not great down there, right?

415
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,450
How dare you blush in front of us?

416
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,590
His body is...

417
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,970
His body is very mature.

418
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:33,170
Not just his body. How about the other thing?

419
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,600
I think it matches the rest of his body.

420
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:42,420
Do you volunteer somewhere without telling us? Or give money to charity?

421
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,640
When, where, how did you meet him, and while doing what?

422
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,400
Hurry up and tell us.

423
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,600
I went to get books at Saegil Bookstore recently.

424
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,300
You read books?

425
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,680
Come on. I read, too.

426
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,990
Anyway, that's not important.

427
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:02,340
I was going to buy all the books at once, and they got so heavy.

428
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,460
I was standing with those heavy books

429
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,710
but someone in line was taking too long to pay. So I got annoyed.

430
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:13,080
So I wanted to see the face of the person who was taking too long.

431
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,190
But I ended up falling in love at first sight.

432
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,820
And he's my boyfriend now.

433
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,800
Hold on. Which Saegil Bookstore was it?

434
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,650
The Mangwoon one.

435
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,860
How's that possible? You're Kim Hye Ryeong.

436
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,430
Gosh. Stop that, Bu Ri.

437
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:43,370
Hey. You guys look down on me, but I still got it, okay?

438
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,580
Yes. I'm jealous.

439
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,310
Gosh. Alcohol tastes bitter today. I lost my single friend today.

440
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,970
Hey, the singles should clank glasses together.

441
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,060
What are you doing, Oh Fatty? Won't you raise your glass?

442
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,120
No way. Is something going on with you, too?

443
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,620
Yeah.

444
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,170
I have a girlfriend, too.

445
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,610
Gosh, really?

446
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,500
Geez, is today a special day?

447
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,000
- I don't believe you. Show me a photo. 
 - You're lying, right?

448
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,450
- Gosh. 
 - Geez.

449
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,760
Does your girlfriend know that you're her boyfriend?

450
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,980
I know. I think she should know.

451
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,270
She should know so she could sue you.

452
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,130
Hey. This is why you can't date in real life.

453
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,400
What?

454
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,200
You don't know how happy I am.

455
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,530
- Cheers. 
 - Yes. Cheers. Cheers.

456
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,390
Jjang Ji, do you want to see another one?

457
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,060
You got a relationship, huh?

458
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:24,600
I was going to tell you, but I missed the timing.

459
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,900
 I should've been there that day. 

460
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,640
I didn't know you were so impressive.

461
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,780
 Geez, bad timing. 

462
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,010
What are you doing? Are you drunk?

463
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:21,260
I'm a little drunk.

464
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,550
What's with the cute voice?

465
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,380
Be honest. I'm cute, right?

466
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,000
- What? 
 - Don't you find me cute?

467
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,960
Well...

468
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,830
y-you're cute.

469
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,500
Really?

470
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,400
I miss you, Babe.

471
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,420
Don't you miss me?

472
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,840
What? You'll pick me up?

473
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,570
No, it's too far away, Babe.

474
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:05,210
 Right. What was I thinking? 

475
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,560
 To Hye Ryeong, I'm... 

476
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,400
 just Pig. 

477
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,590
 I tried drinking to get some sleep, 

478
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,070
 but I can't fall asleep. 

479
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,980
   

480
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,100
 I'll start the film review. 

481
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,970
 A man and a woman are in a relationship that went stale. 

482
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:09,940
 The two try to erase memories of each other. 

483
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:16,570
 But the problem is, they fell in love again after erasing memories of each other. 

484
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,550
 They ask each other after reuniting. 

485
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:25,030
 "We won't be able to stand and get sick of each other eventually." 

486
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,260
 "Do you still want to start over again?" 

487
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,070
 And they answer the question. 

488
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,200
 "It's okay no matter what we end up facing." 

489
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,330
 What would you say if you were in the same situation? 

490
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,030
 Would I be able to... 

491
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,840
 tell Seong Ok that I would be okay with it? 

492
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,490
   

493
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,220
 Thank you in advance. 

494
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,700
Once you start the production line, I'll—

495
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,930
You need to pay in advance.

496
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,310
   

497
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,590
 That's Jewelry A's plan for now. 

498
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:45,290
We needed a new brand for our jewelry line.

499
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,120
Let's make it work together, then.

500
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,780
Thank you. We're hiring designers with fresh designing styles.

501
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,420
Let's chat again once we come up with designs.

502
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,370
Okay. Sounds good.

503
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,510
By the way,

504
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,360
have you heard of H2?

505
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,330
Of course, I know.

506
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,160
Why?

507
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:28,280
   

508
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,210
   

509
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,700
   

510
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,730
   

511
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,280
 Where are you, Nuna? I have good news. 

512
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,240
 When will we have a welcoming party? 

513
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,720
   

514
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,390
   

515
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,150
   

516
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,350
You've been well, right?

517
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,270
Oh, I'm sorry.

518
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,580
How have you been?

519
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,220
Well, I switched jobs.

520
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,260
I wanted to finally get back to my work.

521
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,430
Oh, I know. You look great.

522
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,920
What's this about, by the way? I can't believe you reached out.

523
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,460
Well, I was just curious. I was worried, too.

524
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,610
I see.

525
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,550
- Do you feel uncomfortable, by chance? 
 - What?

526
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,000
No.

527
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,770
To be honest, I was curious, too.

528
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,260
Thank you for reaching out.

529
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,980
I'm glad.

530
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,050
You and I are friends, too.

531
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:14,980
We shouldn't stop hanging out just because you broke up with Hyeon Seong.

532
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,150
Right. Yes.

533
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,420
I think so, too.

534
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,990
Did everyone...

535
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,770
get home safely that night?

536
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,340
Huh?

537
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,490
Yes, yes.

538
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,940
Hyeon Seong, too?

539
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,990
What?

540
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,670
It's just that...

541
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,170
the situation that night was a bit, you know...

542
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,830
So I was kind of curious.

543
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,530
Yes. He got home safely.

544
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:55,960
He did drink a lot, but that's how we guys are.

545
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,660
Yes.

546
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,330
I see.

547
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,290
The thing is...

548
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,590
I wanted to see you today because...

549
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,000
Yes.

550
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,050
- By chance— 
- There you are.

551
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,730
Hey, what are you doing here?

552
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:20,420
I came to meet you since you play hard to get.

553
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,460
Hello, I'm Kim Geon Yeop, and I'll be working with Designer Han.

554
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,490
Oh, I see.

555
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,540
 He's perfect. 

556
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,450
Yes, hello. I'm Hyeon Seong's...

557
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,250
No, I mean... Well...

558
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,610
Oh, are you friends with Hyeon Seong Hyeong?

559
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,090
Oh, you know him.

560
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,370
Yes, I do. I went to Jeongye University.

561
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,760
I'm her college hubae.

562
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,400
Oh, you must know him well, then.

563
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,160
Should we get fried chicken and beer somewhere?

564
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,360
- Fried chicken and beer? 
 - Yes.

565
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,360
I'm almost there.

566
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,210
Wait inside.

567
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,670
Yes. I'm almost there.

568
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,510
- Geez. 
 - Gosh.

569
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,640
I'm sorry.

570
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,730
Yu Ju Nuna.

571
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,090
It's you, right?

572
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,490
Is she your friend? Hello.

573
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,900
Hello.

574
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:40,150
Wow. It's been so long.

575
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,310
How many years has it been?

576
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,370
Nuna?

577
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,660
Huh?

578
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,430
Yes.

579
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,730
Yes. It's been so long.

580
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,200
How have you been?

581
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,810
Same as usual.

582
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,990
My friends are inside. I need to go.

583
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:06,500
Let's get a drink sometime. Call me.

584
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,910
Take care.

585
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,530
- Hey. 
 - Huh?

586
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:22,710
Hey. Who's he?

587
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,380
He's just someone I used to know.

588
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,160
Really?

589
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,000
Gosh, he's cute.

590
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,700
I'd date him if I were about five years younger.

591
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,900
Do you think he likes older women?

592
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,400
I don't know. I'm not really sure.

593
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,320
I was just saying. Don't take it so seriously.

594
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,220
Where should we go? Let's get something tasty.

595
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,150
Yes.

596
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:50,860
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

597
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:27,760
♫  I feel like I'm in love  ♫

598
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:34,040
♫  I know it looks weird, but walk on the road singing ooh~ooh~ooh~  ♫

599
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:39,720
♫  I fall in love with you  ♫

600
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:45,690
♫  When you're in my arms, it's better when you're singing, ooh~ooh~ooh~  ♫

601
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:51,990
♫  From downpour to the rainbow, anything looks great  ♫

602
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:58,000
♫  From the Sun to midnight Moon, when I'm with you, when I'm with you  ♫

603
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,020
♫  From downpour to the rainbow, anything looks great  ♫

604
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,330
♫  From the Sun to midnight Moon, when I'm with you...  ♫

605
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,210
 Don't be afraid to get started! 

606
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:23,100
♫  When I'm with you, when I'm with you, fell like more than great  ♫

607
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,520
   

608
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,670
What are you up to?

609
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,930
 Hey, Hyeon Seong. 

610
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,380
Let's grab a drink.

611
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,920
 Well, I'm a bit busy right now. 

612
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,190
What are you doing?

613
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:42,010
 Who is it? 

614
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:42,980
Hello?

615
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,050
 I'm at the store right now. Talk to you later. 

616
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,660
H-H-Hello? Hello? You're at the store?

617
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,350
Kim Hyeong Seop. Hyeong Seop!

618
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,950
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected... 

619
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,780
Nice to meet you.

620
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,450
   

621
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,380
 - Seong Ok likes shrimp. 
 - Hey. 

622
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,830
 And she doesn't like shrimp, okay? 

623
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,950
 She doesn't eat it because she doesn't like peeling it, okay? 

624
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,240
 Yes. You must know better. 

625
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,610
 That's enough. Seong Ok is doing well. 

626
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,890
 How do you know that? 

627
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:47,640
 - What? 
 - What a loser. Who's this? 

628
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,120
 Geez. It's Hyeong Seop. 

629
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,550
 Please take good care of Ok. 

630
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:56,490
 Don't worry. I'll make sure no one approaches her. 

631
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,840
 Good luck in the military. 

632
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,160
 I'll get going. 

633
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,010
 Hey, are you okay? 

634
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,810
 Yes. 

635
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:18,240
 Hyeong Seop, that son of a bitch. 

636
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:33,120


637
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,090
   

638
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:44,700
♫  We were stars in the midnight sky  ♫

639
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,890
♫  We were shining brighter  ♫

640
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,740
 Nuna, let's take a picture. 

641
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,030
 I want to take my first one with you. 

642
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,000
 What are you thinking about? 

643
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,380
 Don't trust people too easily. 

644
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,890
 I just watched a soccer game with a college hubae. 

645
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,920
 Which college hubae? 

646
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,560
 Which hubae that I don't know? 

647
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,100
 What are you doing right now? 

648
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,170
 So what if he's handsome? 

649
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:15,040
 It's all about the personality... 

650
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,260
 Hello, Hyeong. 

651
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,110
 Shit! 

652
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,370
 Your clothes look new. 

653
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:25,350
 Looks like you got your hair done, too. 

654
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,240
 By chance, do you...

00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:38,380
♫  Every time, every day  ♫

656
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:42,930
♫  Remember when the stars were shining?  ♫

657
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,750
 Could we meet up for a second? I need to tell you something. 

658
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:49,850
♫  Every day  ♫
