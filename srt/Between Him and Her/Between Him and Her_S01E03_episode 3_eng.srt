1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,160
   

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:24,830


3
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,570
   

4
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,100
   

5
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,360
   

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,630
   

7
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,730
   

8
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,610
Hello?

9
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,110
Hey, Han Seong Ok.

10
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,060
Isn't this hard for you?

11
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,090
How can you not even call me once?

12
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,740
I think I'll die right now. Are you totally fine?

13
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,240
I miss you.

14
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,360
I said, I miss you.

15
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,630
Also, aren't you taking this too far?

16
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,240
We've been together forever. How can we break up?

17
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,700
Seriously.

18
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,170
I'm hurting.

19
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,680
Say something, at least!

20
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,040
Han Seong Ok!

21
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,380
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

22
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,750
 After the beep, there will be a charge. 

23
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,710
Seong Ok!

24
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,230
Did you drink?

25
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,540
Yes.

26
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,660
I drank a little with the guys.

27
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,780
Looks like you had fun.

28
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,440
Do you think...

29
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,400
Never mind.

30
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,750
I've been thinking. We...

31
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,750
What's this?

32
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,910
Did you pack your things from the studio?

33
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,910
- No. 
 - You've been preparing for this, haven't you?

34
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,170
It's not like that.

35
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,010
What is it, then?

36
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,450
How could you pack stuff like you've been waiting for this?

37
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,450
Do you think our time together was a joke?

38
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,020
I never said it was a joke.

39
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,530
What's this, then?

40
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,830
What's this?

41
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,230
You're drunk. Let's talk tomorrow!

42
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,870
I'm not drunk. Let's talk now!

43
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,150
You are drunk.

44
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,850
Yes. I'm drunk.

45
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,050
Will you run away using that as an excuse now?

46
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,120
What's that supposed to mean?

47
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,230
Since when did you think about breaking up with me?

48
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,790
- That's enough! 
 - Just say you didn't!

49
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,840
Why can't you just say that?

50
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,000
You're drunk now. I said we should talk tomorrow.

51
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,130
It's because I'm not enough?

52
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,160
- Hey! 
 - That's why, isn't it?

53
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,570
Let's stop! I'll go inside.

54
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,600
Don't go!

55
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,400
If you leave like this,

56
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,850
it'd feel like we're finished.

57
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,550
And think about it!

58
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,330
How can we break up? Huh?

59
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,720
Let's talk! Just one moment. I just need a moment.

60
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,640
Let's talk later!

61
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,690
Hey! Seong Ok!

62
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,470
Han Seong Ok!

63
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,050
It's so annoying.

64
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,340
 What's wrong? 

65
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,090
 Are you okay? 

66
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,880
 Let me look! You're bleeding. 

67
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,480
 Hold on. 

68
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,750
 We are thinking of making it go below the hips. 

69
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,020
 - To there? 
 - Yes, yes. 

70
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,950
 We'll go with black for now, and around the neck, we're thinking of... 

71
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,210
 I ended up hiding without realizing it. 

72
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,780
 We spend the night together but don't even hold hands. 

73
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,860
 I... 

74
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,030
 used to like you. 

75
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,080
 She used to like me? 

76
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,780
 It's true, I wasn't so bad when I was in middle school. 

77
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,050
 Has she been liking me since then? 

78
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,780
Hey, Kim Hye Ryeong!

79
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,370
Wake up, Kim Hye Ryeong!

80
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,590
Wake up, I said!

81
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,330
What are you thinking?

82
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,110
What am I doing here?

83
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,770
It's because you collapsed...

84
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,510
How could a small person drink so much?

85
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,120
I should've just let you sleep on the streets.

86
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,940
You almost died, and I saved you. Yet you dare have shady thoughts about me?

87
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,100
Well, I mean...

88
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,810
I'm sorry.

89
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,640
Hey!

90
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,250
Do you remember...

91
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,210
Do you remember what you told me last night?

92
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,840
What did I say?

93
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,250
Forget it!

94
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,110
Let's not bother. I can't have a conversation with you.

95
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,370
Get up quickly! Let's go get hangover soup!

96
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,390
What? What did I say?

97
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,020
Did I say I'll treat you to a meal again?

98
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,190
 Of course. 

99
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,000
 It's always like this whenever I'm with her. 

100
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,830
Hurry! Hurry up and come out!

101
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,030
Min Hyeok, could I sleep a little longer?

102
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,290
Hurry up and come out!

103
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,510
- I'm so tired. 
 - They called me to come out.

104
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,680
Who called?

105
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,320
Wait for me!

106
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,290
Hey, Pig! Looking at you in daylight...

107
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,330
makes you look fatter.

108
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,860
Yeah, I got fatter. What will you do about it?

109
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,360
It's not like I'd do anything.

110
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,520
But it's a shame that you're spending your 20s as a pig.

111
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,410
Gosh, amazing.

112
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,110
Geez, you're so gross.

113
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,340
You think you're much better?

114
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,820
Isn't it attractive when a pretty girl like me is down to earth?

115
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,900
- Check your front teeth! 
 - What? Is something stuck?

116
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,180
Look. All good, right?

117
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,460
All good. Very clean.

118
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,200
When does your kindergarten vacation end again?

119
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,630
This week.

120
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,890
This week...

121
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,110
- What a relief. 
 - What do you mean?

122
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,550
You wouldn't live like this if you had somewhere to go in the morning.

123
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,430
You don't drink all night and smell like alcohol in front of the kids in the morning, right?

124
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,300
How dare you? I'm not that bad.

125
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,750
- Aren't you going to eat your seonji  (solidified cow blood) ? 
 - I am.

126
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,970
Okay.

127
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,360
Are you crazy?

128
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,080
You told me to eat it.

129
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,070
I'm sorry.

130
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,260
You jerk. I meant I'll eat it later.

131
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,480
I'm doing all this for your diet.

132
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,060
You think I wanted to eat your left over seonji?

133
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,330
I don't have any.

134
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,230
Gosh! That was good.

135
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,180
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you, Pig.

136
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,630
Geez, what are you saying?

137
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,430
You definitely promised to get me hangover soup.

138
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,790
Oh, right!

139
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:01,470
I thought I would until you used my card to pay for the motel after I passed out drunk.

140
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,750
I knew you'd be like this.

141
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,630
 I'll pay. I'll pay, I said. 

142
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,110
 It's on Nuna! 

143
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,470
It's missing the object.

144
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,600
Come on. Whatever. You thought this would work on me?

145
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,470
Of course, I knew you'd say that, too.

146
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,430
 - I, Kim Hye Ryeong... 
 - That's right. 

147
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,140
 - will buy Oh Min Hyeok... 
 - That's right. 

148
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,920
 - hangover soup... 
 - Okay. 

149
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,820
 - tomorrow. 
 - Okay. 

150
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,730
- Wow. 
  - Promise. 

151
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,250
Okay. I lost.

152
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,160
Geez, he somehow got smarter.

153
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,800
Yes!

154
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,300
- Here you go. 
 - Okay.

155
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,660
 It feels like she's neither a man nor a woman. As if she's a different species. 

156
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,900
 But I feel comfortable when I'm with her. 

157
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,580
Pay for the motel now, then!

158
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,370
Here you go.

159
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,330
- Thank you. 
 - Should I?

160
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,210
Thank you.

161
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,750
You can leave now. I'll take a taxi.

162
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,290
You should spend less.

163
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,310
It's my money.

164
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,130
I hope you trip, Ugly Duckling.

165
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,430
Right back at you.

166
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,530
Right back at you.

167
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,280
 Pay me back with an omakase meal for the motel! 
 (means he can choose the food) 

168
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,370
 Don't use the heart symbol! It's gross. 

169
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,490
 Oh Fatty, what are you up to? 

170
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,310
Has Ms. Han been browsing a job posting site or

171
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,570
expressed dissatisfaction about the company often lately?

172
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,860
 Do you have some good news? 

173
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,650
 No. It's nothing. 

174
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,210
 She did smile, looking at her phone. 

175
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,810
She smiled? Seong Ok did?

176
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,350
Yes.

177
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,310
Come to think of it, I think that was the first time I saw her smile.

178
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,170
Did she get a job offer from somewhere nice?

179
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,630
You did the right thing.

180
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,450
You're supposed to use your vacations. You haven't taken the time off, right?

181
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,280
I'll use them without worrying from now on.

182
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,510
Yes. You should relax, too.

183
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,290
- What are you looking at? 
 - Plane tickets.

184
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,580
Nice. It's a good idea to go somewhere far away at a time like this.

185
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,560
   

186
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,310
 Notice. It's Kim Hyeong Seop's birthday this Friday. 

187
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,210
Seriously. Hyeong Seop really loves himself.

188
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,400
He's telling us about his birthday.

189
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,030
- You're coming, right? 
 - No.

190
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,320
Why not? He'll get upset if you don't come.

191
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,900
Let's go.

192
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,770
You didn't do anything wrong. Why would you avoid him?

193
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,480
He should be avoiding you instead.

194
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,570
Are you okay?

195
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,200
Yes.

196
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,190
Of course, I'm okay.

197
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,130
I have no reason to be not okay.

198
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,060
Of course, you do.

199
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,500
And if you're hurting, you're hurting.

200
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,600
You don't need a reason for it.

201
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,200
I dated one person,

202
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,630
but why do I have to break up with so many people?

203
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,610
I feel like I'm losing the whole world that has to do with Hyeon Seong.

204
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,110
Will you actually break up with him?

205
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:02,320
As you said, we've only been together because of attachment.

206
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,930
I did say that, but...

207
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,030
you're still all about Hyeon Seong.

208
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,980
Wouldn't you get hurt more if you broke up like this?

209
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,450
If you were me...

210
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,450
you would've broken up immediately, right?

211
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,080
Yes.

212
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,040
See?

213
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,160
But you're Han Seong Ok.

214
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,610
You were with him for seven years because of who you are.

215
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,910
I can't be loyal and trusting like you.

216
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,430
You know I can't go longer than three months.

217
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,940
We've been together for too long.

218
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,960
That makes it more difficult to figure out what to do.

219
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,040
Did you try talking to him at all?

220
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,340
Not yet.

221
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,860
 I... 

222
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,400
 don't have the courage to face him yet. 

223
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,800
   

224
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,570
Yes, Sir.

225
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,500
I forgot to pay the rent. I'm sorry.

226
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,870
I'll pay you soon. Yes.

227
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,620
Okay. See you. Bye!

228
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,490
Yes, Sir. Hello. Of course, I'll pay you.

229
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,600
I'll visit you sometime and...

230
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,590
I owe you for the fabric.

231
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,600
Yes, thank you. Bye!

232
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,540
   

233
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,190
   

234
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,230
No. You haven't even paid a late payment. I can't start working on a new line.

235
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,420
Please take a look!

236
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,550
I came up with new designs. I'm sure it'd be a success.

237
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,520
- Mr. Jeong! 
 - Yes?

238
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,500
You were sure last time, too.

239
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,260
I like you because you're confident and driven.

240
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,920
I don't know much about design,

241
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,800
but shouldn't you consider marketability instead of insisting on your own style?

242
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,340
Hyeong!

243
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,350
Aigoo, Team Leader. Welcome.

244
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,450
- The samples are ready. 
 - Okay.

245
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,930
I knew it was you, Hyeon Seong.

246
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,210
Hey, we meet again.

247
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,020
You work with them, too?

248
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,240
I knew that long hair looked familiar.

249
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,150
Looks like you know each other.

250
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,500
We know each other well.

251
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,790
He was a star of the fashion design department.

252
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,070
Oh, really?

253
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,100
What are you doing? Say hello!

254
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,440
Hello.

255
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,510
Yes, hello.

256
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,760
He's the college senior I respect the most.

257
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,590
Right, Hyeon Seong?

258
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,110
He must be really impressive if you respect him.

259
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,670
He was.

260
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,760
He won the grand prize whenever he entered a competition.

261
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,940
He could've let his juniors win once,

262
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,670
but he never allowed it.

263
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,260
Anyway, I was so disappointed you left like that.

264
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:49,240
My classmates told me that H2 is very meaningful to you and your girlfriend.

265
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,370
But I could see why you were angry after hearing that.

266
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,620
So I asked Jun Beom to reconsider it.

267
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,900
Hyeong!

268
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,620
I'm doing this because I respect you.

269
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,700
I wouldn't do this for a brand like H2 if it wasn't for you.

270
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,010
Call me, then!

271
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,850
- Where are the samples? 
 - Over there. Let's go!

272
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,130
Take care.

273
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,550
   

274
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,780
   

275
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,530
It's a vanilla latte. Have something sweet while working.

276
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,270
Thank you.

277
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,890
I really felt your absence while you were gone.

278
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,850
I realized how you've been doing such a great job.

279
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,590
- Thank you. 
 - So...

280
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,280
I'm thinking of recommending you for the upcoming promotion meeting.

281
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,940
You can become a team leader at your level of competence.

282
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,000
Well, I...

283
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,630
No need to feel pressured about being a team leader.

284
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,460
You just need to do what you're doing now. I love what you're doing.

285
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,030
Did something happen while I was gone, by chance?

286
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,050
- I think she's worried you'd switch jobs. 
 - What?

287
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,880
She should've been nicer sooner.

288
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,820
   

289
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,420
Hey, Geon Yeop. What's up?

290
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,840
Who?

291
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,720
Nuna!

292
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,450
Geon Yeop!

293
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,400
What are you doing? Get in!

294
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,470
Thank you.

295
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,050
Watch your head!

296
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,620
Seong Ok has been working as a hobby.

297
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,830
 - Why? 
 - Because I'm happy. 

298
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,380
 What? 

299
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,230
 My gosh! 

300
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,120
You didn't have to.

301
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,580
You made time for me. It's the least I can do.

302
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,880
You know there aren't many men like me, right?

303
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,540
Thank you.

304
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,790
Are you and Hyeon Seong doing well?

305
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,670
Of course, we are.

306
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,850
By the way, why did you suddenly want to see me?

307
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,020
Well, the thing is...

308
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,520
   

309
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,400
Right. I heard you got a job.

310
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,870
Congratulations.

311
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:55,190
So I was wondering if you could help me.

312
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,070
- What? 
 - Actually...

313
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,800
I need a designer.

314
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,020
I really liked your work when we were in school.

315
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,270
They can't afford to match your current pay.

316
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,670
So it's probably not such a great offer, but...

317
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:15,300
But I quit designing a long time ago.

318
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,600
I don't think I'd be helpful.

319
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,360
Come on. You can get right back at it. You're a natural.

320
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,190
- I am? 
 - Yes. You have great taste in design.

321
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,870
I'm asking too much, aren't I?

322
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,810
No.

323
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,670
The thing is, it's not about money.

324
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,880
I'm not in a position to make a decision right now.

325
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,850
It's kind of complicated.

326
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,340
How come? Is something going on?

327
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:53,580
Well, H2 has been considering joining Winders.

328
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,970
But it didn't work out.

329
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:58,140
Why? Isn't it a great opportunity?

330
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,050
Well, it just didn't work out.

331
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,460
I know someone at Winders. Should I ask them?

332
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,700
No, it's okay.

333
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,210
How's the food? Is it to your liking?

334
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,570
Yes. I should be treating you to this.

335
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,880
You treated me a lot when we were in school.

336
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
I'm far from paying you back for that. So eat comfortably!

337
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,120
 Go out with me. 

338
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,790
What?

339
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,330
No, it's nothing.

340
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,540
Thank you for making time for me.

341
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,820
No, I should be thanking you.

342
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,300
Give me a call. I'll be waiting.

343
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,860
Okay. Drive safely!

344
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,030
Yes, get home safely!

345
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,160
- Take care. 
 - Bye, Nuna!

346
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,910
It's closing time. Where have you been?

347
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,270
I couldn't go home waiting for you.

348
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,330
Okay. I'll close the register.

349
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,880
Okay.

350
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,140
Let's close!

351
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,630
   

352
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,480
Good.

353
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,280
My gosh...

354
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,840
Pig, Pig, Pig.

355
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,620
 Hello, I'm Ah Bin. 

356
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,310
Wow, she's so freaking pretty.

357
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,160
 - I'm taking a break during a photoshoot.  
 - Read mine, too.

358
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,590
Read mine, too!

359
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,600
 - What are you guys up to?  
 - Gosh, seriously.
    

360
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,710
Shit!

361
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,820
- What? 
 - Hey, Pig! What are you up to?

362
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,680
I'm busy. Hang up!

363
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,280
 You're not busy. Come meet me! 

364
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm busy...

365
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,260
I said I'm busy.

366
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,870
What are you doing?

367
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,680
I'm at Saegil Bookstore. The books are so heavy.

368
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,060
Please help me.

369
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,630
Don't you have any conscience?

370
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,780
I know how strong your arms are. How could you ask for help?

371
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,880
Do you want to die?

372
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,850
 I'm sure I'll die if you hit me with those arms. 

373
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,440
Hang up! I'll call you later.

374
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,940
What? Later? H-Hello...

375
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,740
He now even hangs up on me.

376
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,790
I can do it.

377
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,200
Thank you. Take care.

378
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,340
Come again.

379
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,920
Pig, I'll never buy meals for you again.

380
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,790
It says the payment didn't go through. Do you have another card?

381
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,480
- Well, just one moment. 
 - Okay.

382
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,760
This was declined, too.

383
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,220
Well, I don't have cash.

384
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,040
Excuse me. There are many people in line...

385
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,440
I'm sorry. My cards aren't working.

386
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,100
I feel bad. Do you want to go first?

387
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,150
Do you want me to pay?

388
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,130
Pardon? You'll pay for me?

389
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,980
I mean, you can just send me the money.

390
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,490
Oh, right.

391
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,220
- I'd be so thankful if you could. 
 - Okay.

392
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,070
I'll send it to you right away, then.

393
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,660
Okay.

394
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,690
- I'll pay for his, too. 
 - Okay.

395
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,700
Can you check now?

396
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,040
Okay.

397
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,160
Oh, I got it.

398
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,750
 Jang Eun Wu? Even the name is handsome. 

399
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,900
They look heavy. Should I carry them for you?

400
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,360
I would really love that!

401
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,430
Excuse me?

402
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,890
I'll take them.

403
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,700
Well, I'm taking a taxi—

404
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,300
- I'm taking a bus across the street. 
 - I'm taking a bus, too.

405
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,120
Let's walk together, then!

406
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,840
Okay.

407
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,700
Shit, he's so freaking handsome.

408
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,970
Why isn't she answering her phone?

409
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,170
Seriously.

410
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,990
 Wow, his life must be fun. 

411
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,960
I'll go, Nuna.

412
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,380
Okay. Take care.

413
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,070
Where am I?

414
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,300
Pig?

415
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,760
- Hey! 
   - Why won't you... 

416
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,130
Why won't you answer your phone?

417
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,730
Aren't you at Saegil Bookstore in Mangwon-dong?

418
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,510
 Yes. This is... 

419
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,870
Yeongrim-dong.

420
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,620
 You're out of your mind. 

421
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,400
Did you want me to come to Yeongrim-dong?

422
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,830
It's more than an hour away.

423
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,630
 Well... 

424
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,180
please just come, Min Hyeok.

425
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,670
She's out of her mind.

426
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,900
Kim Hye Ryeong is pissed again.

427
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,190
 It's today. It's Hyeong Seop's birthday. 
   

428
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,220
 Let's drink! Bring presents. 

429
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,110
Whatever.

430
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,380
Haven't you guys made up yet?

431
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,080
Hey, it wasn't even a fight. Make up for what? They should just apologize.

432
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,980
- I mean— 
 - Hey, hey.

433
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,920
You can't fight now. I'm sick of it.

434
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,140
Yeah. I'm sure time will heal things.

435
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,580
Taking too much time might make things worse.

436
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,790
Well, by the way...

437
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,420
Seong Ok isn't just Hyeon Seong's girlfriend. I'm kind of sad she didn't come.

438
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,570
Why? Did you like Seong Ok?

439
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,530
Whoa. Are you out of your mind?

440
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,190
Geez, I shouldn't have come, either.

441
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,870
I'm leaving.

442
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,210
Where do you think you're going?

443
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,840
That's enough! Seong Ok is doing well.

444
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,520
How do you know that?

445
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,170
What?

446
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,830
I saw her on social media.

447
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,160
It looked like she's busy these days.

448
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,680
Didn't you see her posts?

449
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:28,210
No. I've been busy lately.

450
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,840
   

451
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,670
 The blue car. The blue car. The blue car... 

452
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
   

453
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,440
 This bastard. I'm sure his life sucks in real life. 

454
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,380
 But he keeps showing off. 

455
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,870
 Geez, I can't stand him. I could afford one, too. 

456
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,060
   

457
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,590
 What? 

458
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:34,310
 Geez. He's just a kid, and he's already hitting on women. 

459
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,270
 What a sleazy bastard! 

460
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:40,230
 He's uglier than me. 

461
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:46,310
 What a loser! Who's this? 

462
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:54,760
 Huh? Geez. It's Hyeong Sop. 

463
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,240
Hey, can't we have a birthday party without her?

464
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,380
Hurry up and light the candles!

465
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,500
Okay. Did you get a cake?

466
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,260
Gosh, seriously.

467
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,470
Seong Ok was always in charge of cakes.

468
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,470
Who will buy us birthday cakes from now on?

469
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,720
It's a cake.

470
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,020
Should we...

471
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,880
- talk a bit? 
 - What?

472
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,550
Okay.

473
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,360
Shall we talk outside?

474
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,550
Okay.

475
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,160
Whoa, I thought I was dying.

476
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,840
If you asked me to come,

477
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,470
you should talk to me.

478
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,380
I'm sorry.

479
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,820
Even when I think about it...

480
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,610
I've been being annoying.

481
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:14,170
You must be hurting, too, but I went to see you.

482
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,880
Is that what you're...

483
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,120
- sorry about? 
 - Huh?

484
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,290
Yes.

485
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,390
It's okay.

486
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,050
I was being sensitive that day, too. I'm sorry.

487
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,910
No. You shouldn't be sorry.

488
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:46,790
- You know, that day— 
 - Hold on.

489
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,190
Can we talk about that later? I'm still not—

490
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,470
Nothing happened.

491
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,640
- What? 
 - It's not what you think.

492
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,310
Nothing happened. I mean it.

493
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,950
I need to tell you something, too.

494
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,440
To be honest...

495
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:27,540
- To be honest— 
 - Hey, Bro!

496
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,010
What are you guys doing here? Huh?

497
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,120
It's Hyeong Seop's birthday. Don't be so antisocial!

498
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,560
- Let's go in! 
 - Hold on.

499
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,330
Just talk inside!

500
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:42,270
Buddies, today's about Hyeong Seop, okay?

501
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,240
Hey! Were you guys drinking?

502
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,790
What? Why are you coming back with Oh Fatty?

503
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,810
We ran into each other outside.

504
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,340
We need to cut the cake together. They can't be on their own.

505
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,530
And you two.

506
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,690
I know you're a couple, but do you have to show off your love on your friend's birthday?

507
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:01,410
Do you think we haven't been in relationships?

508
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,880
What's with the vibe? Did something happen?

509
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,920
Hey, don't push your luck!

510
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,700
Why?

511
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,520
You two...

512
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,110
B-By chance...

513
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,440
d-did you break up?

514
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,110
Do you think you could prank me?

515
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,660
Don't do stuff like this! It's not funny anymore.

516
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,440
Let's just say you broke up. What was the plan afterward?

517
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,040
Hey, it's not like that.

518
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,000
What? You didn't expect me to react this way, huh?

519
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,800
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

520
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,130
Gosh, seriously. Can't believe I fell for your sloppy pranks.

521
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,940
Okay, I admit. Your acting improved a bit.

522
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,930
Other people would think you actually broke up.

523
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:56,110
Hey, why don't you actually break up this time?

524
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,590
Relationships require too much energy, money, and time.

525
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:03,070
Just break up! Break up! Break—

526
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,710
- Stop that! 
 - Seriously, stop!

527
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,060
All right.

528
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,880
Why are you overreacting?

529
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:15,110
- Come out with me! 
 - What? What? What? What?

530
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,040
Is this acting, too?

531
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,300
Wow, I almost got fooled again.

532
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,470
Just be quiet and go with him!

533
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,970
Come out! Gosh, you're so heavy.

534
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:27,730
Gosh!

535
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,940
Did I do something wrong again?

536
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,420
Why do you talk so much?

537
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,740
Why is everyone so down?

538
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,320
It's Pig.

539
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,430
Shit!

540
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,270
Why?

541
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,600
We don't know, either.

542
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,630
It's kind of serious this time. We shouldn't be joking.

543
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,400
Gosh!

544
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,120
What do I do?

545
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,640
What can you do? You didn't know.

546
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,080
Was I acting really cluelessly?

547
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,830
Yes.

548
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,480
You should've stopped me!

549
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,240
Hey! It's not just anyone. It's them. They won't break up.

550
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,130
I agree with you, but...

551
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,990
I don't know. It seems a bit serious this time.

552
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,970
Gosh...

553
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,320
How about Hyeon Seong? Is he okay?

554
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,660
You think he is?

555
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,470
Gosh, I'm screwed if they break up.

556
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,920
Why are you screwed?

557
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,240
I won't be able to have Seong Ok's ramen anymore.

558
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,730
Seriously.

559
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,940
I'm serious right now.

560
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,080
Hey. Isn't today a happy day?

561
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,520
Why aren't we celebrating?

562
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,290
Here.

563
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,130
You guys, take them out, too.

564
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,570
Okay.

565
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,560
Seop!

566
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,270
Surprise!

567
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,540
What? You said you didn't bring anything. 
    

568
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,730
Open mine first!

569
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,730
Well, right now?

570
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,270
Yes. Why? Don't you want to?

571
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:17,360
No. Well...

572
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,540
Okay. Geez.

573
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,860
- Do I smell? 
 - Yes.

574
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,020
I'm just kidding.

575
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,680
Go ahead and open mine, too!

576
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,030
Okay.

577
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:35,170
I can't believe I'm getting gifts from you guys...

578
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:37,320
I'm so happy...

579
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,830
I-I should open it later.

580
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,850
Hey! How long are you going to do this?

581
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:52,380
Either break up or keep seeing each other.

582
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,860
How can they break up?

583
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,710
I agree.

584
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,710
I... I mean...

585
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,870
We can't accept it.

586
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:05,240
At the beach on Christmas Eve. Remember?

587
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,970
We were 25 or 26 years old.

588
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:10,580
You guys fought a lot and talked about breaking up.

589
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,310
So we took you to the beach, and we ate grilled clams together.

590
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:14,380
On Christmas Eve.

591
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,070
Why are you bringing up grilled clams now?

592
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:19,240
Well, I'm just saying...

593
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:24,940
I hope we can laugh about this later, too.

594
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,090
Sit down, Oh Fatty!

595
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,780
Okay.

596
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:36,390
Jeong Hyeon Seong, don't you have anything to say to Seong Ok?

597
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,840
Hey, hey! Don't be like that.

598
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,260
Break up if you have nothing to say!

599
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,530
You don't even appreciate her.

600
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,080
I'm against it.

601
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,810
I don't know what happened,

602
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:49,440
but let's just slap the back of Hyeon Seong's head and get over it.

603
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,430
I don't think you guys should break up.

604
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,730
I'm against it, too. We shared your seven-year-long relationship, too.

605
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:58,330
What will we do if you guys break up?

606
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:00,310
Should we go to the beach again? Should we?

607
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,460
Why? Why?

608
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,540
Relationships can go stale for a bit. You can't break up for that.

609
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,890
You've been together for seven years.

610
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:08,420
He doesn't know how lucky he is.

611
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,990
You're not successful or anything.

612
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,740
You should be thanking Seong Ok for dating you.

613
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,810
It's not like she cheated on you or anything.

614
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,980
It's your fault, unless she did.

615
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,580
Did you say "cheat" just now?

616
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,680
Don't you know Ok?

617
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,010
She hasn't even looked at another man for seven years.

618
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,110
Am I wrong, Ok?

619
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,250
Han Seong Ok.

620
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,260
You didn't, right?

621
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,550
To be honest,

622
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:58,700
I...

623
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:06,670
   

624
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:16,890


625
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,460
 She's a female friend I have no feelings for. 

626
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,670
 It's normal to feel excited even if I don't like her, right? 

627
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,640
 Be honest! I'm cute, right? 

628
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,650
 Don't you find me cute? 

629
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:37,840
 Hye Ryeong, let's talk for a second. 

630
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,340
 I need to tell you something, too. 

631
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,510
 What are you guys talking about? 

632
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,900
 He and I have a lot in common. 

633
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,930
 Don't worry! I'll make sure no men approach her. 

634
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:49,690
 It's a secret between Hyeong Seop and me. 

635
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:51,440
 You and I are friends, too. 

636
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,150
 We shouldn't stop hanging out since you broke up with Hyeon Seong. 

637
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:57,300
 I have good news. 

638
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,340
 It'd be a shame to let a day like today go. 

639
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,310
 Where are you? 

640
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,150
 Kim Hyeong Seop...
