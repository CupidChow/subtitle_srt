Besides, he wouldn't have been so neglectful of me if he cared

138
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,920

141
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,990

No, no, well...

150
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,990

I really like him, I said.

162
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,650
He's fun to be with, and I want to get to know him more.

163
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,460

Hey, don't worry.

165
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,270
I don't think he's a bad person.

166
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,990
Okay, I'll call you again.

171
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,250
What?

172
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,360
I was just curious.

173
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,300
I'm not pressuring you. I'm just asking.

174
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,810
What do you like to do usually?

Yes. This is our first date, you know.

No, no. Just you, Oppa.

182
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
I'll take one.

183
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,660
What?

184
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,960
Wow, that's nice.

185
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,740
Are you sure I don't look weird?

186
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,560
No, it turned out well.

187
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,670
It feels like this moment was captured.

188
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,770
It'd feel different when time passes.

189
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,260
<i>I feel like you can truly capture the moment.</i>

190
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,150
<i>But you'd feel differently about this moment after time passes.</i>

191
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,350
Yoo Na...

192
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,460
you should go home now.

193
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,790
What?

194
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,970
I just remembered something.

195
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,820
Let's call it a night and hang out again next time.

196
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,250
Next time?

197
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,660
Yes.

198
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,200
Will there really be a next time?

199
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,970
Yes, see you.

200
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,590
<i>Why are you suddenly doing this?</i>

201
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,400
<i>I'll be good to you. I will.</i>

202
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,360
<i>I'll never do what you don't want me to do.</i>

203
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,120
<i>I'm sorry, Shi Hoo.</i>

204
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,710
<i>Noona, please.</i>

205
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,610
What's going on?

206
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,790
What brings you all the way here?

207
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,680
I suddenly got curious about something.

208
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,250
No...

209
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,870
It's not sudden.

210
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,290
I've been curious for the last six years.

211
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,250
Why did you do that to me?

212
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,180
Why did you do that?

213
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,220
I was...

214
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,270
young, too.

215
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:01,120
It took me too long to realize that breakups have to be cordial, too.

216
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,670
I was six years older than you,

217
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,980
but...

218
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,650
I was 29 years old then.

219
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,050
I didn't know...

220
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,680
you'd be hurting all this time because of me.

221
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,100
Shi Hoo.

222
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,160
I'm sorry I hurt you.

223
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,110
I don't know if that was enough of an answer,

224
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,410
but I'll get going now.

225
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,190
Yoon Yoo Joo.

226
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,450
Did you even love me?

227
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,160
Answer me.

228
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,110
Did you even love me?

229
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,430
I loved you.

230
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,690
Sincerely.

231
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,500
I loved you a lot,

232
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,890
was very thankful,

233
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,410
and felt very bad.

234
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,440
♫ <i>I think of you every time I take a step</i> ♫

235
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,140
When you become around my age,

236
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,470
I'd like you to understand how I feel.

237
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:20,920
♫ <i>With my loose shoelaces</i> ♫

238
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:29,290
♫ <i>I stare at the sky that changed me</i> ♫

239
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:38,180
♫ <i>Slowly, a little slowly, would you get further away from me?</i> ♫

240
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:45,960
♫ <i>So, we could remember our old laughter</i> ♫

241
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,320
<i>I don't know what true love is yet,</i>

242
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,040
<i>but I could tell she meant it.</i>

243
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,770
<i>I'm sorry, and thank you, Yoon Yoo Joo.</i>

244
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,400
Ok!

245
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,940
Hey.

246
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,510
- How are you?
- Why are you coming from there?

247
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,360
I walked.

248
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,210
What's going on? Where are we going that you wanted to meet at a bus stop?

249
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,600
Wait and see. Come this way.

250
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,890
- What?
- Be careful. Be careful.

251
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,610
What's going on?

252
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,530
Ta-da!

253
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,320
What? What's this?

254
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,710
Hey, this is so cool.

255
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,930
Are you calling yourself cool right now?

256
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,950
No, not me. I meant you.

257
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,630
You're cool, Han Seong Ok.

258
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,750
- Hey.
- Yes?

259
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,230
You need to talk to me about something.

260
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,490
Like what?

261
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,290
Jeong Hyeon Seong. What happened?

262
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,780
Did you come here to ask that?

263
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,280
What's more important than that?

264
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,150
Huh? Tell me right now.

265
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,030
Aren't you going to tell me?

266
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,380
Tell me. What's going on?

267
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,040
That's the most important thing.

268
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,590
- Tell me.
- Excuse me.

269
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,870
You're Eun Jeong sunbaenim, right?

270
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,140
- Me?
- Gosh, it is her!

271
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,030
I'm on a soccer team at your high school.

272
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,550
- I see.
- We're big fans.

273
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,150
The school still shows videos of your games.

274
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,430
They tell us to be half as good as you.

275
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,830
Could you let us take a photo with you?

276
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,130
Yes, of course.

277
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,200
I-I'll take it for you.

278
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,330
Okay.

279
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,630
One, two, three.

280
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,900
Wow, this is so daebak.

281
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,120
By the way, why do you no longer play soccer?

282
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,360
It's because I've been injured.

283
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
I'm a model now.

284
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,800
Wow, daebak.

285
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,390
You're seriously so cool.

286
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,810
Gosh, thank you.

287
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,470
Thank you so much.

288
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,000
Take care.

289
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,630
Do you miss it?

290
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,640
Not at all. It's not a good memory or anything.

291
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,730
Hey,

292
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,550
do you want to go to the last stop on the bus like we did in high school?

293
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,510
You suddenly want to go to the last stop?

294
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,930
Let's do it. I want to do it again.

295
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,690
What's the deal? Why, all of a sudden-

296
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,070
The bus is coming.

297
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,660
Gosh.

298
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,330
Won't you get on?

299
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,580
Hey!

300
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,140
What's going on?

301
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,680
Im Joon Soo.

302
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,240
I think I saw Im Joon Soo.

303
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,110
<i>Spin kicks are about accuracy than speed.</i>

304
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,990
You have to push the ball with the big toe

305
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,250
and the front of your foot to spin it.

306
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:41,120
The key is to go with the flow rather than kicking with force.

307
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,580
Okay?

308
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,040
Are you listening?

309
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,420
Pardon?

310
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,930
Yes.

311
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,750
Give it a try, then.

312
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,750
Sunbae.

313
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,930
Yes?

314
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,950
I'll train hard and make sure to follow you to the UK.

315
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,940
So wait for me.

316
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,360
You know, too, right?

317
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,760
I trained really hard to go to the UK.

318
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,270
I think that was the problem.

319
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,180
Since I was only focusing on my goal,

320
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,590
I ended up getting injured.

321
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,730
I couldn't go to the UK, either.

322
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,670
I know.

323
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,470
You took it very hard then.

324
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,360
I know I couldn't go because of the injury.

325
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,860
But he told me to wait. How could he date an idol as soon as he left?

326
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,540
Son of a bitch.

327
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,200
I know.

328
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,470
So?

329
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,740
What would you have done if it were really Yoon Joon Soo?

330
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,950
I don't know.

331
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,900
I guess I wanted to swear at him.

332
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,930
You know...

333
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,330
if I didn't work as hard,

334
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,190
and wasn't as good as others in soccer...

335
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,010
Would it have been...

336
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,800
easier to accept it?

337
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,470
Well...

338
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,980
you discovered a new career since you had to quit soccer.

339
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,640
You're doing a great job as a model.

340
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,520
You're right. I'm doing great.

341
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,380
I'm also...

342
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,460
saying you have to...

343
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,000
let him go completely to meet someone nice.

344
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,030
You can't keep having three-month-long relationships.

345
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,600
What?

346
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,990
How could you be so smart about other people's relationships?

347
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,490
You want to die?

348
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,220
Make sure you don't regret seeing Jeong Hyeon Seong.

349
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,960
Tag along if you're worried.

350
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,220
Really? Can I come?

351
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,930
- I'll sit in the corner without making a noise.
- No, don't.

352
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,270
Aren't you getting off?

353
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,330
This is the last stop.

354
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,290
Oh, okay. Thank you.

355
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,150
I'm sorry.

356
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,190
[See you then]

357
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,250
The ring.

358
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,100
The ring...

359
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,490
What are you doing?

360
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,260
- Here's coffee.
- Thank you.

361
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,600
These are...

362
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,520

00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,190
How pretty.

543
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,550
No.

544
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,720
It's not my design.

545
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,860
Is it your girlfriend's, then?

546
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,910
Yes.

547
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,080
Those are the days.

548
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,690
Are you proposing to your girlfriend?

549
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,220
Time and women don't wait for you.

550
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,710
What's the use of regretting after they leave?

551
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,060
Make sure it's not too late, okay?

552
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,790
Okay.

553
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,640
<i>Saturday at three. Let's meet here.</i>

554
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,510
Hello?

555
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:01,620
Mom, did you take my lipstick in my room?

556
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,230
<i>Oh, that...</i>

557
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:07,360
<i>I think I brought it to the office and left it there.</i>

558
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,430
Why didn't you ask me first?

559
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,850
No, it's okay. Got it.

560
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,010
Is this better?

561
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,030
The blue one?

562
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,150
No, the dress shirt is better.

563
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,890
<i>I'm meeting Seong Ok.</i>

564
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,940
<i>I'm meeting Hyeon Seong.</i>

565
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:52,880
<i>But I can't sort out my head or heart.</i>

566
00:44:54,990 --> 00:45:00,040
<i>Are the qualities he liked in me still even there?</i>

567
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,460
<i>I feel like I'll finally stop feeling lost.</i>

568
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:20,080
<i>How should I start the conversation?</i>

569
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,910
<i>Would I even be able to make eye contact?</i>

570
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:03,980
<i>I'm nervous,</i>

571
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,090
<i>but I can't wait to see her.</i>

572
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,510
<i>I'll try to act natural.</i>

573
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,050
<i>Would I be able to act normal?</i>

574
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:25,920
♫ <i>I feel like I'm in love</i> ♫

575

578
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:50,230
♫ <i>You asked me another day, "Will you love me forever?"</i> ♫

579
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:56,210
♫ <i>And I said, "I'm not the type who can leave someone like you."</i> ♫

Geon Yeob, what are you doing here?

585
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:39,430
I'm sorry.

586
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,970
I lied to you about something.

587

<i>Hi, Sally.</i>

600
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,430
<i>Who wants to hang out with me?</i>

601
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,520

<i>Hey...</i>

603
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,930
<i>What's with you?</i>

604
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,620
<i>Why are you going to sleep already?</i>

605
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,630
<i>Are you sure you're not sick?</i>

606
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,420
<i>Get out!</i>

607
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,710
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

608
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,730
<i>You always looked bored</i>

609
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,260
<i>and you didn't even make eye contact.</i>

610
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:10,980
<i>I wanted us to be more curious and think about each other more.</i>

611
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,300
<i>Was that really that hard?</i>

612
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,470
<i>What broke once is bound to break again.</i>

613
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,700
<i>Discard what's broken and move on to a new one.</i>
