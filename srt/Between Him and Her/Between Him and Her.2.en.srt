[What are you up to?]

3
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,860
Have you tried contacting the "Are you sleeping" oppa?

4
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,260
Why are you suddenly bringing him up?

5
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,760
The "Are you sleeping" oppa? What? Who's that?

6
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,500
How come only I don't know? Fill me in.

7
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,070
There's someone who asks if she's sleeping all the time.

8
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,640
Did you say someone slept with her?

9
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,760
Seriously. He asks if she's sleeping, I said.

10
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,540
Why would he ask if he hasn't slept with her?

11
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,890
It's nothing.

12
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,070
You should decide whether you'll talk to your boyfriend or us.

13
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,330
Sorry. He said he'd pick me up.

14
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,230
What? Did you make double plans?

15
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,110
No. I really wanted to only hang out with you guys,

16
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,370
but he says he'd wait until we're done. What am I supposed to do?

17
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,090
Should I do something for you?

18
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,810
I bet he'd do this for three months maximum.

19
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,730
You're wrong. It's different this time.

20
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,830
I'll date him for a very long time.

21
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,000

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,480

23

24

Seong Ok, she agreed to treat us.

28
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,320
Oh, really?

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,610
Why won't you respond? When are we meeting?

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,850
I think I'll be free today.

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,100
I'll send you the address. Meet me there.

32
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,530
Who is it?

33
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,250
Did Hyeon Seong apologize?

34
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,800
No.

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,110
You're seeing the "Are you sleeping" oppa, aren't you?

36
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,880
What? Are you leaving to sleep with someone else?

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,040
It's not like that. He treated me to a meal last time.

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm just grabbing a drink because I couldn't ignore it.

39

You're meeting a man Hyeon Seong doesn't know privately at this hour?

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,670
Isn't that just cheating?

41
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,080
No, it's not.

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,760
Are you Seong Ok?

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,560
What do you think is crucial in a relationship?

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,970
I don't know. What is it?

45
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,870
The tension that comes from the possibility that the other person might leave me.

46
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,210
You need such tension to be more grateful that they're with you and you treat them better.

47
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,820
Jeong Hyeon Seong needs to know, too.

48
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,690
Seong Ok is a long-time girlfriend he feels comfortable with to him.

49
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,420
But she's someone new to other men.

he gets at least a million views. Million.

94
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:43,150
If he just posts an outfit, the sales of the brand skyrockets that day.

95

Your design isn't bad at all, Seong Ok.

96
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,190
You need to get close to influencers like him.

This is an expensive cognac.

Do you know why cognac glasses are short and round?

327
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,380
Did you know love has an expiration date, too?

328
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,280
Huh? What do you mean?

329
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,190
They experimented with couples who just started dating.

330
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,510
When they were first interviewed, they didn't look at the camera.

331
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,440
They used to only look at each other, holding hands.

332
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,100
But as time passed, they only looked at the camera without looking at each other.

333
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,880
Come on. I won't be like that.

334
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,470
Listen. So...

335
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,200
they had a brain scan when they first started being interviewed.

336
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,800
Yeah?

337
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,520
At first, dopamine was actively released in their left brains.

338
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,400
But after 100 days, the dopamine level went down

339
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,860
and the hormones that control logical thinking started being created.

340
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:09,420
According to science, love lasts for 100 days to three years.

341
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:13,310
They say old couples stay together because of loyalty, not love.

342
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,350
Will we end up like that, too?

343
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,020
No.

344
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,050
As for me... Look.

345
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:23,210
I can control both my left brain and right brain.

346
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,410
- What are you talking about?
- I'm serious.

347
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,830
Just believe me.

348
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,860
I want to.

349
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,570
I'm serious. Just believe me.

350
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,670
- Promise?
- Promise.

351
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,850
Then, should we send our kid to an English-speaking kindergarten?

352
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,910
Sounds good.

353
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,750
We'll get a green sofa,

354
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,430
and we'll get an extendable dining table.

355
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,380
I love it.

356
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,880
Would black be better than green?

357
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,340
I like anything you like.

358
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,020
On that note, do you want to do it again?

359
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,460
What? You were thinking about that without listening to me, huh?

360
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,160
No. I listened to everything.

361

Let's do it again. Please?

362

I don't want to. I won't.

- Don't come.
- What? What is it?

Come on...

366

Why were we so confident back then?

367
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:31,340
What were we so confident about that we made so many promises?

368
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,120
We didn't get to keep them, anyway.

I knew you were a coward.

467
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,270
You don't care about others hurting, but you want to avoid getting hurt.

Hey, don't be like that. He's stressed out, too-

474
