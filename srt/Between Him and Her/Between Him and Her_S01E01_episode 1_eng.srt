1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800


2
00:00:14,113 --> 00:00:16,683
Can't you knock? 
    

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,153
Geez. I almost peed my pants.

4
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:25,993
Why are you suddenly inviting everyone to the seventh-anniversary party?

5
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,213
Geez.

6
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:30,223
Seriously. You're bad at aiming.

7
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:33,183
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:34,733
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

9
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:36,453
Come on.

10
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,543
You know the things I can do, right?

11
00:00:38,543 --> 00:00:39,783
I'm sure.

12
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:42,083
Why are you so grumpy?

13
00:00:42,773 --> 00:00:44,613
Hey.

14
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:49,223
I see. It's that time of the month.

15
00:00:49,903 --> 00:00:52,023
It hasn't even started.

16
00:00:52,023 --> 00:00:55,673
What? Is it irregular again?

17
00:00:55,673 --> 00:00:58,213
Why? Are you concerned?

18
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:00,733
I mean, I'm worried. You know.

19
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:03,833
- Why are you wiping on me? 
 - You're mine.

20
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:06,163
Why did you invite them?

21
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:09,070
And if I don't? Will it be just the two of us?

22
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:11,243
Just us?

23
00:01:11,243 --> 00:01:13,943
See? It's awkward, right?

24
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:15,973
Whatever.

25
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:19,853
We have an announcement to make, you know.

26
00:01:19,853 --> 00:01:21,593
What?

27
00:01:24,573 --> 00:01:26,123
No wonder.

28
00:01:26,123 --> 00:01:28,543
I got the wine you like too.

29
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:30,073
Let's drink it ourselves and not give it to them.

30
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:32,563
Tonight. After everyone leaves. Deal?

31
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:34,073
- You want to do it tonight? 
 - Aren't we going to?

32
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:35,623
We'll be drinking, though.

33
00:01:35,623 --> 00:01:37,283
- Let's do it next time. 
 - But it's our anniversary.

34
00:01:37,283 --> 00:01:39,193
Hey.

35
00:01:39,193 --> 00:01:41,753
What difference does it make?

36
00:01:46,593 --> 00:01:47,803
Hey.

37
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:49,123
Hey.

38
00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:50,803
- What? 
 - Be ready!

39
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:53,503
- Don't be ridiculous. 
 - Hey.

40
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:58,103
Hey. I heard you. Just don't get drunk.

41
00:01:58,103 --> 00:01:59,923
Okay.

42
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:09,533
   

43
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,210
   

44
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:41,853
Congratulations on your seventh anniversary! 
    

45
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:44,493
 Congratulations! 

46
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:47,393
Drink! Drink!

47
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:51,063
Wow, Seong Ok is wearing makeup because it's the seventh anniversary.

48
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:54,183
An Si Hu, it's not for you. No need to be interested.

49
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:55,673
Who is it for, then?

50
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:57,523
It's Hyeon Seong. Who else?

51
00:03:57,523 --> 00:03:59,853
Hyeong Seop. You are forever single.

52
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,193
You look down on me for saying stuff like this now?

53
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:03,443
That's why you should date.

54
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,123
You should date a bit less.

55
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:07,243
Why start a fight, Ryu Eun Jeong?

56
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:09,933
Can people never sleep together while dating?

57
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,673
You usually call that a friendship.

58
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:13,393
- What if the friends slept together? 
 - That's—

59
00:04:13,393 --> 00:04:14,953
Are you interested in breaking up, by chance?

60
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:16,783
I don't want to see these losers anymore.

61
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:18,643
I know. You really are losers.

62
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:20,753
Hey, hey, hey. Listen up!

63
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:22,223
What is it?

64
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:25,783
I wanted to bring all of you here and tell you something.

65
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:27,953
Whoa. Hold on.

66
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:29,603
Hey. Hey. No!

67
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,203
No, no, no.

68
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:33,033
Hold on. Is it what I'm thinking?

69
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:35,283
- It can't be. 
 - It's about time they get married.

70
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:36,823
- Is it for real? 
 - Really?

71
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:41,463
Well, it's not what you want to hear.

72
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:44,373
H2 is joining Winders.

73
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:45,533
Unders? What's that?

74
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,643
The No. 1 fashion platform. Winders.

75
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:49,263
It's already on all of your phones.

76
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:53,343
The Winders that you passionately criticized for ruining fashion culture?

77
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:58,353
That Winders you criticized for selling copies of trendy designs made with cheap materials?

78
00:04:58,353 --> 00:04:59,383
Really?

79
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,323
I can't forever be stubborn about things.

80
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:06,663
Is Seong Ok quitting her job and coming back as H2's designer?

81
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:08,223
Isn't it obvious?

82
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,703
Seong Ok is a designer, too.

83
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:11,523
Winders acquired so many brands.

84
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:13,273
Joining them doesn't guarantee success, right?

85
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:17,333
Seong Ok will have to suffer a bit until Hyeon Seong settles down.

86
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,903
You think Seong Ok works for Hyeon Seong?

87
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,533
That is so annoying.

88
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:25,193
Wasn't it how it was? Seong Ok pays for the rent here, too—

89
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:27,843
Hey, hey. Stop!

90
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:29,683
I don't work for anyone. I work for myself.

91
00:05:29,683 --> 00:05:33,703
Yes. Of course, she should go back to jewelry design.

92
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:35,913
I'll work harder so she can.

93
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:38,233
Jeong Hyeon Seong, you'd better become successful.

94
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,503
And don't abandon us if you do!

95
00:05:40,503 --> 00:05:42,323
What do you mean, abandon?

96
00:05:42,323 --> 00:05:43,633
Let's say I become successful.

97
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:46,463
If I do, I'll get each of you a car.

98
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:48,213
You mean it, right? I'll start picking one, okay?

99
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:49,573
- Go ahead. 
 - All right!

100
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:51,493
Hey. Why would you get them cars?

101
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:53,283
Think about being good to Seong Ok first.

102
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:55,413
Of course...

103
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:56,843
she comes first.

104
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:58,943
Hey, hey, hey. Raise your glasses. Hurry.

105
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:01,503
- Okay. 
 - H2. You know, you know, you know.

106
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:03,153
H2. Here we go!

107
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:06,443
 Here we go! 

108
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:11,983
Wow. Ok's ramen always looks so amazing.

109
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:13,093
Are you leaving?

110
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:15,133
I'll see you later.

111
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:17,033
Thank you for today.

112
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,883
It's nothing.

113
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:21,003
Don't go home too late, okay?

114
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:22,173
Have some ramen before you go.

115
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,613
You can eat all of it.

116
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:25,003
- See you. 
 - Bye.

117
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:27,863
Do you have other drinks?

118
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:31,203
Wow. You guys eat so well.

119
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:33,723
I want a sports car.

120
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:36,923
Hey, Scumbag. You should be grateful to have a compact car.

121
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:39,333
I'll take a compact car.

122
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,153
A sports car and a compact car. Okay.

123
00:06:41,153 --> 00:06:42,863
- Got it. 
 - Yay!

124
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:44,513
You have wine here.

125
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:46,123
Can we drink this?

126
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:47,493
What is it?

127
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:50,183
Bring that over. Let's drink it!

128
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:52,663
Here we go.

129
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,503
What's this now?

130
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:56,063
You need to open it properly.

131
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:59,743
I worked at restaurants forever.

132
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:06,673
You're good.

133
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:13,903
Here.

134
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:18,423
Madam Ok.

135
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,693
I'll skip this one.

136
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:23,713
- She doesn't want it. 
 - Are you leaving?

137
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:25,853
I'll come with you.

138
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:29,533
Why? I thought you were sleeping over.

139
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:32,603
Everyone is here.

140
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:35,143
- So? 
 - "So"?

141
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:46,553
It's because we ran out of drinks.

142
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,383
Sure. That's just how you are.

143
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:49,993
Hey.

144
00:07:50,593 --> 00:07:53,023
I can get you another one. Okay?

145
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:55,613
Let's just drink. We're in a good mood tonight.

146
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:57,363
Don't go.

147
00:07:58,283 --> 00:08:00,133
Should I leave without you?

148
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,293
No, I'm leaving now.

149
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,953
Hey, pour me some.

150
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:22,193
 There was a time he used to get so antsy whenever I looked a bit down. 

151
00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:24,173
Asshole.

152
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:35,793
   

153
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,123
How much did we drink?

154
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:43,913
My head hurts.

155
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:48,373
Shit.

156
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:04,633
   

157
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:12,843
   

158
00:09:20,123 --> 00:09:22,373
 This is the new product line. 

159
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:25,403
 Please come up with the marketing concept. 

160
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:54,083
Ms. Han, what are you doing?

161
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:02,843
Looks like you work for the design team. I didn't know.

162
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:04,183
I work for the marketing team.

163
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:07,623
I thought you didn't know what team you work for.

164
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:10,933
Everyone has assigned tasks at work.

165
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:14,483
Let's try to stay in our lanes.

166
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,723
Okay.

167
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,183
Did you design this, Seong Ok?

168
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:35,603
This is way better.

169
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:38,603
Not at all.

170
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,873
 What are you up to? 

171
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:23,543
Looks like they started dating recently.

172
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,433
 Dating someone for seven years. 

173
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:40,443
 You get comfortable as you're used to it, and therefore it gets boring. 

174
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:42,833
 I didn't know we'd end up like this. 

175
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,573
 Confess your love! Confess your love! 
   

176
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:48,423
 Confess your love! Confess your love! 

177
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:49,843
 Confess your love! 

178
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:52,433
 - Aren't you going to say it? 
 - Confess your love! 

179
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:54,533
 Huh? 

180
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:57,053
 Well... the thing is... 

181
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:59,113
 Well... the thing is... 

182
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:06,903
 Go out with me! 

183
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,753
 That's how we started falling in love. 

184
00:12:57,073 --> 00:13:01,453
 Our heart-fluttering and innocent days passed. 

185
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:04,003
   

186
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:08,823
 She even waited for me to finish my military duty, which is tough. 

187
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:14,763
 Salut! 

188
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:38,503
 Why are you looking at that woman? 

189
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:39,693
 I'm not. 
   

190
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:43,113
 I saw your eyes shifting, okay? 

191
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:47,513
 I really didn't look at her. 

192
00:13:47,513 --> 00:13:49,143
 Don't you believe me? 

193
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:50,283
 Are you sure? 

194
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:52,143
 Wherever I go, all I see is you. 

195
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:54,713
 I only have eyes for you! 

196
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:56,983
 Do you even love me? 

197
00:13:56,983 --> 00:13:59,943
 Why can't you believe the one you love, then? 

198
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:01,943
 Hyeon Seong. 

199
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,733
 I love you. 

200
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:06,713
 Han Seong Ok. 

201
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:19,353
 No hard feelings could interfere with our love. 

202
00:14:19,353 --> 00:14:22,243
   

203
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:40,443
 What are you doing? 

204
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:49,863
 And we wanted to do it whenever we made eye contact. 

205
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:59,893
♫  We're on different paths  ♫

206
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:01,693
♫  We took too much of a detour  ♫

207
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,843
 Should I turn the lights off? 

208
00:15:03,843 --> 00:15:04,873
 No. 

209
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:07,733
♫  Maybe we are destiny  ♫

210
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,773
 I like doing it while looking at each other. 

211
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:14,393
♫  You'll always be on my mind  ♫

212
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:18,893
♫  Babe, like the countless stars in the night sky, I will always be there  ♫

213
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:23,593
 I loved Seong Ok more passionately than anyone. 

214
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:29,823
 But now she's a part of my life like she's my family. 

215
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:35,563
 Wanting my heart to flutter again is probably illogical. 

216
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:56,673
   

217
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,493
Hi, Mom.

218
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:08,983
What's wrong with your voice?

219
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,143
 It's nothing. What is it? 

220
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:14,493
I wanted to bring you the beef bone soup I made.

221
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,083
 Oh, I see. 

222
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,493
I don't really like beef bone soup.

223
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:20,123
 But Hyeon Seong does. 

224
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:25,073
By the way, has he told you anything?

225
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:27,243
 Like what? 

226
00:16:27,243 --> 00:16:30,083
What do you mean?

227
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:34,443
He should be getting a proper job by now.

228
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:36,693
Mom, Hyeon Seong...

229
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:39,893
will join Winders soon.

230
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:41,663
Winders?

231
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:43,023
What's that?

232
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:45,683
- It's like a corporation in this field. 
  - Really? 

233
00:16:45,683 --> 00:16:49,163
Hey, why did you wait so long to tell me that?

234
00:16:49,163 --> 00:16:52,483
Hey. Will you guys discuss marriage too—

235
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:54,573
Mom, I'm working right now.

236
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:57,183
I'll call you later.

237
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:02,273
Oh, Mom. I'll pick up the beef bone soup, okay?

238
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:05,103
- Okay. 
  - Bye. 

239
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:06,963
Wait...

240
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:49,523
   

241
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:57,483
Ta-da. A real-time "Like." What do you think?

242
00:17:57,483 --> 00:17:59,553
Are you on social media all day?

243
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:02,173
Yes. I only look at yours.

244
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:04,683
Switch to a public account. I want people to see it, too.

245
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,213
No. I failed once.

246
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,543
No one's successful immediately.

247
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:13,943
To become successful, you have to go through a hardship once and—

248
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:15,783
Yes, I'm listening.

249
00:18:15,783 --> 00:18:19,603
Whatever. You're joining Winders soon.

250
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:21,493
I'll be your jewelry model. Okay?

251
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:23,323
You'd better not hire someone else.

252
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:26,083
Okay. I know you're famous.

253
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,673
- Let me see the photos you took today. 
 - Okay.

254
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:32,763
- Look. 
 - Wow.

255
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:37,673
I think I look kind of chubby.

256
00:18:37,673 --> 00:18:40,043
They do retouching, anyway.

257
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:42,463
I have a new boyfriend.

258
00:18:42,463 --> 00:18:44,083
- Again? 
 - Yes.

259
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,003
Don't you get confused if you switch them out so often?

260
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:48,453
I want to avoid switching if I can.

261
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:50,153
But they just swap themselves out.

262
00:18:50,153 --> 00:18:52,673
You won't know because you've only dated one man.

263
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,343
They always pretend to be nice at first,

264
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,303
but they get relaxed as time passes a bit.

265
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,733
I don't like dating someone out of a feeling of attachment.

266
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:02,943
There's no excitement, and it doesn't keep you on your toes.

267
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:07,973
Do you feel guilty?

268
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:10,703
No.

269
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:11,983
Don't deny it.

270
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:15,343
By the way, why did Hyeon Seong suddenly get it together?

271
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:18,013
Are you discussing marriage seriously?

272
00:19:18,013 --> 00:19:20,133
No. Marriage, my foot.

273
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:22,473
One of his seonbaes works at Winders

274
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:25,243
and he suggested he join them. That's why.

275
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:28,283
Didn't he say he'd never join a specialty brand even if he were starving?

276
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:30,783
I don't understand him any better.

277
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:35,213
What? What is it?

278
00:19:35,213 --> 00:19:38,293
When was the last time you guys did it?

279
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:39,883
No. I mean, do you even do it?

280
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:42,993
Hey. Why would you ask that? Are you crazy?

281
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:45,473
I can't tell if you're a couple or friends.

282
00:19:45,473 --> 00:19:47,213
- Gosh, seriously. 
 - Hey.

283
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:51,593
How about that guy? What happened to the one who used to contact you?

284
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:53,203
- Who? 
 - You know,

285
00:19:53,203 --> 00:19:56,553
that Oppa who used to ask you if you were sleeping at two in the morning.

286
00:19:56,553 --> 00:19:58,213
Oh, you mean Jong Hyeon Oppa?

287
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:01,263
Yes. You said he bought you beef too.

288
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,933
You didn't cut him off after letting him treat you—

289
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:07,213
Well, that was because I helped him once.

290
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:10,923
And isn't it weird to respond to a text that late—

291
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:14,213
Hey. No one treats someone to beef without a goal.

292
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:20,303
To be nice, someone treats you to no more than pork. Frozen pork belly, to be exact.

293
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,143
It sounds like a proverb since you're saying it so seriously.

294
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:25,603
- Keep it in mind as if it's a proverb. 
 - Geez.

295
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:28,033
Keeping in touch with him can't hurt you.

296
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:31,413
You know Hyeon Seong, too. How could you say that?

297
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:34,673
So what? I'm just telling you to call him once.

298
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:40,633
And that would keep Hyeon Seong on his toes and text you back right away and stuff.

299
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:43,203
You're so clueless.

300
00:20:44,753 --> 00:20:46,903
   

301
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:48,333
What?

302
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,063
Hey. Is he watching us?

303
00:20:50,063 --> 00:20:52,203
I'll tell him everything.

304
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:56,543
Hey, Hyeon Seong!

305
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:58,543
 Hey. 

306
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:00,803
 Um, have you eaten? 

307
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:04,203
I ate with Eun Jeong. We're at a café now.

308
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:09,613
 I see. Well, where's H2's logo file again? 

309
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:11,493
 I couldn't find it. 

310
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:14,933
Is it urgent?

311
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:17,923
 Yes. No. Well... 

312
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:20,163
 It's here. I found it. 

313
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:23,393
Okay.

314
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,703
See? He called me.

315
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:33,573
Yes. Speaking of the devil.

316
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:56,583
You scared me. When did you come?

317
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,803
Ten minutes ago?

318
00:21:57,803 --> 00:21:59,603
You should've said something.

319
00:21:59,603 --> 00:22:02,083
You were so focused.

320
00:22:05,343 --> 00:22:12,113
"H2 is a native brand based in Seoul that leads the street fashion culture..."

321
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:13,833
Do you have to use the word "native"?

322
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,123
- How about— 
 - Hold on, hold on.

323
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:16,593
- How's the typeface? 
 - What?

324
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:19,803
Should I use one that pops more?

325
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:25,623
- The typeface is— 
 - I should just go with it.

326
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,043
Do you want another coffee?

327
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:32,283
No. I already drank a lot.

328
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:39,863
Seong Ok.

329
00:22:42,173 --> 00:22:44,883
- Can you wait for me at home? 
 - Why?

330
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:46,723
Am I bothering you?

331
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:50,523
You're being sharp again.

332
00:22:57,993 --> 00:23:00,423
   

333
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:08,173
   

334
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:12,113
 Theme park! Theme park! 

335
00:23:12,113 --> 00:23:14,143
 - Where are we? 
 - We're at Neverland. 

336
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,513
 We're at Neverland. And what are we here for? 

337
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:19,023
 We're here to take rides and eat churros too. 

338
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,373
 We'll eat churros too. 

339
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:23,283
 The churros are good here. 

340
00:23:23,283 --> 00:23:24,413
 What rides are we going on today? 

341
00:23:24,413 --> 00:23:27,423
 We're... Which ones should we go on? 

342
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:34,703
Do you want to go to Neverland?

343
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:38,403
- All of a sudden? 
 - We used to go often. It's been a while.

344
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,953
Seong Ok, we might seem young,

345
00:23:43,953 --> 00:23:46,113
but we'd be sick the next day if we went there.

346
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:49,123
So instead of going out, let's just stay at home and—

347
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:51,953
Get fried chicken, beer, watch a soccer game,

348
00:23:51,953 --> 00:23:54,973
and have sex at home if there's spare time?

349
00:23:58,163 --> 00:23:59,463
Why would you say it like that?

350
00:23:59,463 --> 00:24:01,233
That's all we've been doing for the past couple of years.

351
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:03,563
When did we exactly...

352
00:24:10,363 --> 00:24:15,203
Let's go somewhere really nice if this goes well. Okay?

353
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,773
Hold on.

354
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:33,223
I got berated by the manager today.

355
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:35,893
Really?

356
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:38,103
She blatantly swore at me.

357
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,843
I see...

358
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:41,603
Really?

359
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:45,983
I'm thinking of quitting my job.

360
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:50,453
- Hey. 
 - This looks good.

361
00:25:13,103 --> 00:25:14,783
What?

362
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:38,343
Geez, those bastards. They said they'd clean up.

363
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:42,503
Why did you leave without me?

364
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:47,813
Give me that. I'll do it.

365
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,313
It's okay.

366
00:25:49,313 --> 00:25:52,553
Come on. Let me do it.

367
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,463
Are you angry?

368
00:25:59,243 --> 00:26:00,813
I'll do it. I'm good at doing the dishes. You know.

369
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:03,273
I need to do them again if you do.

370
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:31,983
Let's take a trip abroad, just the two of us, for our eighth anniversary.

371
00:26:31,983 --> 00:26:33,313
The place you wanted to go.

372
00:26:33,313 --> 00:26:36,093
You said that five years ago too.

373
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:38,313
Oh, did I?

374
00:26:39,513 --> 00:26:41,163
Let's actually go next year!

375
00:26:41,163 --> 00:26:44,773
I always keep my promises even though it takes time, right?

376
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:46,603
Do you?

377
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:51,723
And let's go to a very expensive restaurant and get whatever you want.

378
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:53,343
Get expensive dishes without looking at the prices.

379
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:54,943
And should we stay at a hotel too?

380
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:58,053
What was the one you wanted to go to? Was it Croa—

381
00:26:58,053 --> 00:26:59,423
Hyeon Seong.

382
00:26:59,423 --> 00:27:01,043
Huh?

383
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:05,333
I don't want you to make money and do something for me.

384
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,613
I just miss the way you used to be.

385
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,143
I'm sorry.

386
00:27:13,143 --> 00:27:14,933
I swear I'll be good to you.

387
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,693
You know me. I'm Jeong Hyeon Seong.

388
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:20,863
I know Jeong Hyeon Seong.

389
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:26,823
Come here. Come here.

390
00:27:27,373 --> 00:27:28,503
- Don't be mad. 
 - Don't bother.

391
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:30,333
What's wrong?

392
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:32,513
- I'll tickle you. 
 - Don't do it.

393
00:27:32,513 --> 00:27:34,403
Why not? Don't be mad.

394
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,333
Don't be mad. Don't be mad! Don't be mad.

395
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,853
- Seriously, stop. 
 - What do you mean?

396
00:27:39,853 --> 00:27:41,543
Don't be mad!

397
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:44,193
- Don't be mad! 
 - Stop that! Seriously!

398
00:27:44,193 --> 00:27:45,373
Don't do it!

399
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,263
I haven't started it. I'll start now.

400
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:49,223
- I will. 
 - Seriously!

401
00:27:49,223 --> 00:27:51,013
Come on.

402
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:52,643
- Seriously, don't do it. 
 - Are you angry?

403
00:27:52,643 --> 00:27:53,863
- Seriously, don't. 
 - Are you still angry?

404
00:27:53,863 --> 00:27:56,403
- No, no, no. 
 - You're not, right?

405
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,193
Did you bring it?

406
00:28:06,193 --> 00:28:08,243
Let's start for now.

407
00:28:09,593 --> 00:28:12,243
Bring it. Right now.

408
00:28:21,473 --> 00:28:25,983
 Damn it. When did I shave? I didn't even think of checking. 

409
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:30,803
- Let's turn the lights off. 
 - Huh?

410
00:28:30,803 --> 00:28:32,243
Why?

411
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,543
Let's just do it! You like doing it while looking at each other.

412
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:41,603
I said, let's turn it off!

413
00:28:56,313 --> 00:28:58,843
 Kill yourself, Han Seong Ok. 

414
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:05,033
- Do you want to do it from behind? 
 - Why?

415
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:06,593
You don't want to see my face?

416
00:29:06,593 --> 00:29:08,473
No...

417
00:29:09,223 --> 00:29:11,123
It's nothing.

418
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:57,663
 Hey, Yong Min is starting the game tonight. I'll bring fried chicken. 

419
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:06,243
Hey. You ignored my texts, but you're looking at your phone right after?

420
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:08,253
What?

421
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,943
It's not like that.

422
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,173
I love you.

423
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:41,263
Why don't you answer?

424
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:47,873
Whatever. Let's get up now.

425
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:50,643
Hug me a little longer.

426
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:53,303
- I can't. 
 - Why not?

427
00:30:53,303 --> 00:30:55,093
The guys are coming.

428
00:30:56,573 --> 00:30:57,763
What?

429
00:30:57,763 --> 00:31:01,263
Yong Min is starting the game today. That's okay, right?

430
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,553
What?

431
00:31:22,043 --> 00:31:24,593
Hey. Put your clothes on!

432
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:27,163
Do you want everyone to know we did it?

433
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,983
How did this fall here?

434
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:47,603
I should put it away before they come.

435
00:31:47,603 --> 00:31:51,523
 Ding-dong! Here comes the fried chicken! 

436
00:31:52,723 --> 00:31:55,333
Look. They're doing three back since four back won't work.

437
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,593
What are you saying? Look. That's the best.

438
00:31:57,593 --> 00:31:59,283
Hey, hey, hey. The center forward will be good today, too.

439
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:00,963
What are you talking about?

440
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:03,333
There are no midfielders to support, okay?

441
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,583
Hey, he's... He's good, okay?

442
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,963
 I got pushed aside by friends, 

443
00:32:07,963 --> 00:32:10,183
 work, and now... 

444
00:32:10,923 --> 00:32:13,583
 I'm no better than soccer. 

445
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:15,743
Shoot!

446
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:18,863
 - Gosh. 
 - Geez! 

447
00:32:18,863 --> 00:32:21,373
Gosh, it's so frustrating. If only they did that once...

448
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,983
- Shit. 
 - They could've done it just once.

449
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,333
Why do it twice?

450
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,943
That's his habit. Seriously.

451
00:32:27,943 --> 00:32:29,193
 He's running! 

452
00:32:29,193 --> 00:32:31,013
Look at him!

453
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:34,933
- Shoot! 
 - Goal!

454
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:38,783
I told you, right? Right?

455
00:32:38,783 --> 00:32:40,813
Daebak!

456
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:45,803
All right!

457
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:48,603
What are you doing, Seong Ok? Let's drink.

458
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:50,093
Let's drink!

459
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,283
Put your hand away!

460
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:53,113
- Wow. 
 - Gosh!

461
00:32:53,113 --> 00:32:55,503
Madam Ok, you're a bit grumpy today.

462
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:57,823
- Yes. 
 - Let's have a drink.

463
00:32:57,823 --> 00:33:00,043
Here. Let's drink. Come on.

464
00:33:00,043 --> 00:33:02,943
You drink all you want.

465
00:33:02,943 --> 00:33:04,653
Hey.

466
00:33:05,243 --> 00:33:07,633
Geez. Don't be like that. Cheers.

467
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:09,433
I said I don't want to drink.

468
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:13,693
 Wow, Son Heung Min and his amazing animal instinct... 

469
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:15,613
Talk to me for a second.

470
00:33:16,183 --> 00:33:19,103
 That was a perfect closing to the game. 

471
00:33:20,073 --> 00:33:21,743
 The first half has ended. 

472
00:33:21,743 --> 00:33:24,153
 - What's the problem? 
 - What? 

473
00:33:24,153 --> 00:33:25,653
 What do you mean by what? 

474
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:27,233
 Why do you look so pissed? 

475
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:29,393
 When did I? 

476
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:31,183
 The guys are here, too. Must you do this? 

477
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:32,273
 Do you care more about them? 

478
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:34,463
 What? That's not what I'm saying. 

479
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:36,693
 What are you saying, then? 

480
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:40,303
What are you so unhappy about?

481
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:42,233
Don't you know how you've been acting all day?

482
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:45,233
- You're saying I'm the problem, right? 
 - What?

483
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:51,793
I did something wrong again, didn't I?

484
00:33:51,793 --> 00:33:53,813
What are you unhappy about?

485
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:56,703
Is it because I didn't care for you when I was working at the café?

486
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,963
Do you not want me to work, then?

487
00:33:58,963 --> 00:34:00,583
What?

488
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,173
You think I'm like this for no reason?

489
00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:07,813
You're acting annoying right now.

490
00:34:09,643 --> 00:34:11,103
Don't you think you do?

491
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:13,683
What did I do? Do you think I'm not fed up?

492
00:34:13,683 --> 00:34:15,283
Hey.

493
00:34:16,453 --> 00:34:19,233
Have you recently...

494
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:22,703
Have you ever thought about me once?

495
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:25,553
Hey, that's...

496
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:31,763
Hey.

497
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:42,063
Han Seong Ok!

498
00:34:51,993 --> 00:34:54,443
 We're entering the second half of the game. 

499
00:34:54,443 --> 00:34:57,533
- Was that the only reason? 
 - Only?

500
00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:05,123
Never mind.

501
00:35:05,123 --> 00:35:07,383
I should've thrown it away properly.

502
00:35:07,383 --> 00:35:09,753
I'm sorry. I was careless.

503
00:35:12,993 --> 00:35:14,923
I'm sorry about everything.

504
00:35:14,923 --> 00:35:17,733
So let's make up and go inside.

505
00:35:22,373 --> 00:35:24,813
I've been busy with work lately.

506
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:28,093
So I didn't care about your feelings. I'm sorry.

507
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,913
I don't want to fight with you.

508
00:35:30,913 --> 00:35:32,553
Let's go.

509
00:35:33,753 --> 00:35:35,713
No.

510
00:35:37,393 --> 00:35:38,673
I've been sensitive lately, too.

511
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:40,853
Yes. Let's go inside.

512
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:43,713
Let's go inside and have fun as if nothing happened.

513
00:35:43,713 --> 00:35:45,443
Yong Min scored, too.

514
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,913
Let's go in. Let's go.

515
00:35:48,803 --> 00:35:51,813
No. I'll just go home now.

516
00:35:51,813 --> 00:35:53,103
Please explain it to everyone.

517
00:35:53,103 --> 00:35:54,713
What is it now?

518
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:58,513
Hey. You can't just leave like this.

519
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:01,963
If you leave now, we're over. We're seriously over.

520
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:18,583
Did you say we're over?

521
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:21,933
- Huh? 
 - You said...

522
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:24,333
- we're over, right? 
 - Don't be like that.

523
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,133
- How are we supposed to break up? 
 - And if we don't?

524
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:28,743
What?

525
00:36:28,743 --> 00:36:31,313
Will you marry me?

526
00:36:33,503 --> 00:36:35,833
Are we getting married?

527
00:36:45,213 --> 00:36:46,813
What?

528
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:50,393
Looks like you never even thought about it.

529
00:36:50,393 --> 00:36:52,493
I mean...

530
00:36:55,903 --> 00:36:59,053
Well, it's just so sudden.

531
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:01,093
Forget it!

532
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,803
I didn't mean it, either.

533
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:15,423
By chance...

534
00:37:15,423 --> 00:37:17,183
Is there something going on with you?

535
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:19,133
Why?

536
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:21,723
Are you worried I got pregnant or something?

537
00:37:31,653 --> 00:37:33,633
Don't worry!

538
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:36,913
I won't make you stay for something like that.

539
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:44,483
Hey!

540
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:46,363
Han Seong Ok!

541
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,913
Gosh.

542
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:56,503
This is driving me crazy.

543
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,733
   

544
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:33,613
 I've been distant lately because of work. 

545
00:38:33,613 --> 00:38:35,623
 You understand that, right? 

546
00:38:46,453 --> 00:38:49,613
   

547
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:58,093
 No, I was too... 

548
00:39:07,003 --> 00:39:09,513
 Good luck with your meeting today. 

549
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:16,663
 Okay. Thank you. 

550
00:39:16,663 --> 00:39:18,493
 Okay. Thank you. 

551
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:29,513
 Let's go to Neverland after the meeting. 

552
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:31,833
 To celebrate our seventh anniversary. 

553
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,573
   

554
00:39:46,163 --> 00:39:49,033
Do you have some good news?

555
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:51,643
No. It's nothing.

556
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:55,233
 When are you free? 

557
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:58,383
 Should we get a drink? I know a nice place. 

558
00:39:58,383 --> 00:40:02,653
   

559
00:40:06,873 --> 00:40:10,933
   

560
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:18,273
The fashion design department's pride. Jeong Hyeon Seong.

561
00:40:18,273 --> 00:40:20,953
You're just as handsome. You've been well, right?

562
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:23,383
- Yes, President Park.
 - Hey, what President?

563
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:25,333
Just call me "Hyeong"!

564
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,323
Seonbae, long time no see.

565
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:28,883
You've been well, right?

566
00:40:28,883 --> 00:40:30,323
Of course, I have.

567
00:40:30,323 --> 00:40:32,213
I didn't know you worked here.

568
00:40:32,213 --> 00:40:35,363
Okay. Enough with the pleasantries.

569
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:37,243
Have you thought about it?

570
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:40,093
Yes.

571
00:40:40,093 --> 00:40:43,823
As you said, I think joining Winders

572
00:40:43,823 --> 00:40:47,213
will help H2 be exposed to more diverse customers.

573
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:52,043
So I've been thinking about how to introduce H2.

574
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:53,963
Just one second.

575
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:55,543
So...

576
00:40:57,503 --> 00:40:59,903
If you see this, it says...

577
00:40:59,903 --> 00:41:04,123
"H2 is a native brand that leads the street fashion culture."

578
00:41:04,123 --> 00:41:08,463
"Foreign brands are dominating the street fashion market—"

579
00:41:10,953 --> 00:41:14,843
I trust you. Isn't that all we need?

580
00:41:14,843 --> 00:41:18,033
- Pardon? 
 - Myeong Jin recommended you with great enthusiasm.

581
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:21,713
You were the senior I looked up to, the most.

582
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:22,863
How heartwarming.

583
00:41:22,863 --> 00:41:26,893
A successful junior is supporting the senior he respects.

584
00:41:26,893 --> 00:41:31,143
Since we're on the topic, H2 has good designs and a loyal fan base.

585
00:41:31,143 --> 00:41:34,193
That's all nice, but it doesn't make enough profit.

586
00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:36,003
Don't insist on high-quality fabrics.

587
00:41:36,003 --> 00:41:39,143
Cost-effectiveness is priority number one and two.

588
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:41,323
Oh, I see.

589
00:41:41,323 --> 00:41:45,603
Yes. I'll take care of the business side.

590
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,303
Here. Let's make this work together.

591
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:55,693
   

592
00:41:57,383 --> 00:41:59,093
What's this...

593
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:01,873
Will I not be designing?

594
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:02,963
We have Myeong Jin.

595
00:42:02,963 --> 00:42:05,873
Let us design! It'll be the same if you put the H2 tag on it.

596
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:07,723
You don't have to worry about the quality.

597
00:42:07,723 --> 00:42:09,123
I learned a lot from you.

598
00:42:09,123 --> 00:42:10,893
I mean...

599
00:42:11,593 --> 00:42:14,133
I come up with the designs and choose fabrics for H2—

600
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:15,903
I told you just now.

601
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:19,103
Cost-effectiveness. No one puts effort into designing these days.

602
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:23,673
Finding trendy items abroad is way cheaper.

603
00:42:23,673 --> 00:42:26,843
Just sign it! I'll make you money.

604
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:29,913
I can't believe I'll be working with Jeong Hyeon Seong.

605
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:31,463
Myeong Jin, thank you.

606
00:42:31,463 --> 00:42:33,803
You're welcome.

607
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:35,603
Don't we have a pen?

608
00:42:36,393 --> 00:42:40,383
It's cooler to sign a contract with a cheap pen.

609
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:41,903
Here.

610
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:50,193
And we're only releasing the fashion line, okay?

611
00:42:50,743 --> 00:42:52,243
Pardon?

612
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:53,643
How about the jewelry, then?

613
00:42:53,643 --> 00:42:55,613
We have our jewelry business department.

614
00:42:55,613 --> 00:42:58,623
We agreed to only release the fashion line.

615
00:43:00,823 --> 00:43:04,663
- President. 
 - Come on. I told you to call me "Hyeong."

616
00:43:06,643 --> 00:43:08,143
I won't do it.

617
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:11,833
- What? 
 - This isn't exactly what I envisioned.

618
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:14,033
What you envisioned?

619
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:17,053
I explained things nicely, but you don't get it.

620
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,143
Jeong Hyeon Seong! Won't you make money?

621
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:20,993
You still don't know why H2 isn't a success?

622
00:43:20,993 --> 00:43:22,383
I do.

623
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:24,773
I know better than anyone.

624
00:43:24,773 --> 00:43:27,663
But H2 is a brand Seong Ok and I...

625
00:43:28,163 --> 00:43:31,193
created together by working hard.

626
00:43:31,823 --> 00:43:33,643
I can't abandon the jewelry line.

627
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:36,873
Seong Ok? Who's that?

628
00:43:36,873 --> 00:43:40,213
- Do you know her? 
 - You mean your girlfriend?

629
00:43:40,213 --> 00:43:42,383
I didn't think you'd still be with her.

630
00:43:42,383 --> 00:43:44,263
They've been together while we were in school.

631
00:43:44,263 --> 00:43:45,483
Everyone at school knew.

632
00:43:45,483 --> 00:43:49,363
Hey, we're discussing business. But you're saying you won't because of your girlfriend?

633
00:43:49,363 --> 00:43:51,853
She's not just a girlfriend.

634
00:43:51,853 --> 00:43:54,233
H2 is us, and...

635
00:43:55,043 --> 00:43:57,203
we are H2.

636
00:43:57,203 --> 00:43:59,823
I'll get going if you're finished.

637
00:44:04,903 --> 00:44:07,533
Hey, Jeong Hyeon Seong.

638
00:44:10,743 --> 00:44:13,003
What the hell did he just say?

639
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:21,823
 The main concept is the skateboard's unique image. 

640
00:44:21,823 --> 00:44:24,673
 To create an image that's energetic and free 

641
00:44:24,673 --> 00:44:28,093
 that fits a street wear brand. That's one of them. 

642
00:44:28,093 --> 00:44:31,213
 The goal is to come up with H2's unique image. 

643
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:36,263
 I'm H2's designer, Jeong Hyeon Seong. 

644
00:44:36,263 --> 00:44:38,893
   

645
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:39,973
 That was cool. 

646
00:44:39,973 --> 00:44:42,483
 Why is it H2, by the way? 

647
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:45,883
 "Hip to human." 

648
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:51,363
 It means we aspire to a trendiness that's devoted to humanity. 

649
00:44:51,363 --> 00:44:52,903
 That's pretty clever. 

650
00:44:52,903 --> 00:44:57,153
 Actually, there's a more important meaning than that. 

651
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,563
 What is it? 

652
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:01,443
 H as in Han Seong Ok. 

653
00:45:01,443 --> 00:45:03,763
 And H, as in Hyeon Seong. 

654
00:45:03,763 --> 00:45:07,953
 It means it's a brand created by the two of us. 

655
00:45:07,953 --> 00:45:10,253
 No matter what happens, 

656
00:45:10,253 --> 00:45:12,573
 I'll make sure to protect it. 

657
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:15,453
 Since it's our name. 

658
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:20,513
♫  Wherever there is a rainbow  ♫

659
00:45:20,513 --> 00:45:24,263
♫  Everything is quiet  ♫

660
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,213
 I love you. 

661
00:45:28,163 --> 00:45:29,123
 Me, too. 

662
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:32,483
♫  Wherever there is a rainbow  ♫

663
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:35,423
♫  Everything is quiet  ♫

664
00:45:35,423 --> 00:45:38,443
♫  From the sun to midnight moon  ♫

665
00:45:38,443 --> 00:45:44,103
♫  When I'm with you, when I'm with you  ♫

666
00:45:47,403 --> 00:45:50,343
♫  When I'm with you, when I'm with you  ♫

667
00:45:50,343 --> 00:45:53,833
♫  Fell like more than rain  ♫

668
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:58,283
♫  It's been seven years from the school where we fell in love  ♫

669
00:45:58,283 --> 00:46:02,003
♫  I know it can't be a lie if nothing hasn't changed  ♫

670
00:46:02,003 --> 00:46:05,423
♫  But I can't believe you're still mine  ♫

671
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:10,973
♫  I've fallen in love with you  ♫

672
00:46:10,973 --> 00:46:14,093
♫  When I got you in my eyes  ♫

673
00:46:14,093 --> 00:46:18,723
♫  Singing ooh, ooh, ooh ~  ♫

674
00:46:20,673 --> 00:46:21,973
Hey, you were here.

675
00:46:21,973 --> 00:46:25,363
Huh? Of course, I am.

676
00:46:27,713 --> 00:46:29,703
- What are you doing? 
 - Well...

677
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,463
It's a new season.

678
00:46:31,463 --> 00:46:33,943
I should get started again.

679
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,933
Oh, do you want coffee?

680
00:46:37,933 --> 00:46:39,543
I got some milk.

681
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:41,173
Okay.

682
00:46:43,363 --> 00:46:45,083
Iced?

683
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:57,403
I haven't had coffee you made in a while.

684
00:46:58,563 --> 00:47:01,843
I fell for you, seeing you making coffee from behind.

685
00:47:01,843 --> 00:47:03,353
Did I tell you?

686
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:08,223
You made me coffee every morning when you lived in the studio apartment.

687
00:47:08,223 --> 00:47:11,133
It was fun watching you from behind.

688
00:47:11,133 --> 00:47:12,903
I liked the coffee you made too.

689
00:47:12,903 --> 00:47:14,753
Hot!

690
00:47:14,753 --> 00:47:16,743
Are you okay?

691
00:47:16,743 --> 00:47:17,763
- Gosh. 
 - Let me see.

692
00:47:17,763 --> 00:47:20,053
Hey!

693
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:23,703
Seriously.

694
00:47:24,893 --> 00:47:26,523
You should've been careful.

695
00:47:26,523 --> 00:47:28,493
What would you do without me?

696
00:47:28,493 --> 00:47:30,443
But you're here.

697
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:33,343
How can you smile now?

698
00:47:33,343 --> 00:47:36,103
Keep doing it. I'll look for an ointment.

699
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,853
- Seong Ok. 
 - Yes?

700
00:47:40,183 --> 00:47:42,713
You know Winders?

701
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:45,413
I decided not to do it.

702
00:47:45,413 --> 00:47:47,393
What?

703
00:47:47,393 --> 00:47:49,173
Why?

704
00:47:49,173 --> 00:47:52,953
I can't bring myself to make only trendy clothes.

705
00:47:53,683 --> 00:47:56,263
What's wrong with trends?

706
00:47:56,263 --> 00:47:57,643
What do you think a trend is?

707
00:47:57,643 --> 00:48:00,553
Isn't it, what people like?

708
00:48:00,553 --> 00:48:03,503
What's wrong with making clothes that people like?

709
00:48:03,503 --> 00:48:07,643
You also said it's meaningless if the consumers don't choose the product.

710
00:48:07,643 --> 00:48:10,603
Isn't that why you worked on joining Winders?

711
00:48:10,603 --> 00:48:14,053
I thought I could, but...

712
00:48:14,053 --> 00:48:15,793
I realized I couldn't when I was there.

713
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:18,563
I can't work for someone else, either.

714
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:28,883
Do you think I like working for someone else?

715
00:48:29,703 --> 00:48:31,153
What?

716
00:48:31,153 --> 00:48:34,373
Why do you think I got a job, giving up on designing?

717
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:35,853
Don't you remember?

718
00:48:35,853 --> 00:48:41,383
Or did you think it was only fair because you think you're superior?

719
00:48:46,983 --> 00:48:48,453
Seong Ok, it's not like that.

720
00:48:48,453 --> 00:48:51,693
What is it, then? I did it for our future.

721
00:48:51,693 --> 00:48:54,063
How could you always be so selfish?

722
00:48:54,063 --> 00:48:58,663
Shouldn't you have decided after discussing it with me, at least?

723
00:48:58,663 --> 00:49:00,333
Seong Ok, calm down and listen to me—

724
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:03,363
Hyeon Seong, have you ever...

725
00:49:03,363 --> 00:49:07,213
thought about us, not just you?

726
00:49:07,713 --> 00:49:10,223
Have you ever...

727
00:49:11,643 --> 00:49:15,323
thought about our future seriously even once?

728
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,123
Are you saying I only care about myself?

729
00:49:22,123 --> 00:49:24,253
Aren't you?

730
00:49:27,063 --> 00:49:28,403
Fine.

731
00:49:28,403 --> 00:49:32,223
That's what happened because I'm such a bloody selfish bastard. Okay?

732
00:49:33,373 --> 00:49:37,383
Does H2 joining Winders only concern you?

733
00:49:37,383 --> 00:49:39,613
What am I to you, exactly?

734
00:49:39,613 --> 00:49:42,203
Am I someone who makes money and pays the rent?

735
00:49:42,203 --> 00:49:44,043
- Is this about the rent? 
 - What?

736
00:49:44,043 --> 00:49:47,053
Is it because you're upset you've been paying rent?

737
00:49:47,053 --> 00:49:48,893
I can pay you back for all of it!

738
00:49:48,893 --> 00:49:50,853
No...

739
00:49:50,853 --> 00:49:55,603
I'm not asking you to pay me that money back. I'm just...

740
00:49:57,293 --> 00:50:00,293
I'm just asking you to think about me at least once.

741
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:04,093
What more am I supposed to do? Shit. Seriously.

742
00:50:05,723 --> 00:50:07,423
What?

743
00:50:16,043 --> 00:50:19,993
Let's stop now. My head hurts. Okay?

744
00:50:20,803 --> 00:50:24,513
I guess acting like this with you gives you a headache, huh?

745
00:50:24,513 --> 00:50:26,723
Please!

746
00:50:27,933 --> 00:50:30,263
Let's stop, I said.

747
00:50:30,263 --> 00:50:32,873
It's already over.

748
00:50:33,523 --> 00:50:36,683
What's the point of us fighting right now?

749
00:50:39,153 --> 00:50:41,143
There's no point.

750
00:50:42,283 --> 00:50:44,823
It means nothing at all.

751
00:50:44,823 --> 00:50:48,513
I should go. I don't know what I'm doing here, when I mean nothing at all.

752
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:50,553
Hey, Han Seong Ok.

753
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:04,663
Never mind. Go.

754
00:51:25,773 --> 00:51:29,403
Hey, I feel awful today. Let's drink.

755
00:51:29,403 --> 00:51:30,703
Hurry up. Cheers.

756
00:51:30,703 --> 00:51:33,513
- Hurry. 
 - Cheers.

757
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:42,153
We won't take a break. Take more.

758
00:51:43,063 --> 00:51:44,413
Cheers.

759
00:51:44,413 --> 00:51:47,053
- Hurry! 
 - Come on.

760
00:51:50,163 --> 00:51:51,753
What's wrong with him today?

761
00:51:51,753 --> 00:51:53,053
He rejected Unders.

762
00:51:53,053 --> 00:51:54,603
Under...

763
00:51:55,703 --> 00:51:57,353
Winders.

764
00:51:57,353 --> 00:52:00,613
- It's Winders. Winders. 
 - Winders?

765
00:52:00,613 --> 00:52:02,773
Gosh, how about my car?

766
00:52:02,773 --> 00:52:04,323
He hasn't gotten his act together yet.

767
00:52:04,323 --> 00:52:07,673
He'll have to get beaten by Seong Ok, right?

768
00:52:07,673 --> 00:52:09,033
Is Seong Ok beating Hyeon Seong up?

769
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:10,133
Not allowed to bring her up.

770
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:14,173
- What if she ends up quitting her job— 
 - Seong Ok...

771
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,763
Don't mention her name.

772
00:52:15,763 --> 00:52:17,293
Okay.

773
00:52:17,963 --> 00:52:20,633
- Seong Ok. 
 - Shit.

774
00:52:20,633 --> 00:52:22,893
Cheers. Gosh.

775
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:24,313
Cheers.

776
00:52:24,313 --> 00:52:26,213
Cheers.

777
00:52:33,753 --> 00:52:36,253
The girl I asked for a phone number is nearby with her friends now.

778
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,943
Should I invite them? Should I?

779
00:52:37,943 --> 00:52:39,423
Why? Let's just keep it to ourselves—

780
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:41,403
Wow, Hyeong Seop is paying.

781
00:52:41,403 --> 00:52:42,983
That isn't the problem right now.

782
00:52:42,983 --> 00:52:45,833
- It's a serious problem. 
 - You're like Santa Claus.

783
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:48,633
You mean Scrooge. What's wrong with you?

784
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:53,543
Gosh, I would've dolled up if I would've known.

785
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:56,943
What's the point of a pig getting dolled up?

786
00:52:56,943 --> 00:52:58,433
Hey.

787
00:52:58,433 --> 00:53:01,713
- Take your couple's ring off. 
 - Why invite women?

788
00:53:01,713 --> 00:53:03,883
Take it off, I said.

789
00:53:08,213 --> 00:53:10,123
You're crazy about women.

790
00:53:10,123 --> 00:53:12,113
Well, Hyeon Seong.

791
00:53:13,163 --> 00:53:16,433
- Take it off. 
 - Let's just hang out by ourselves. Cheers.

792
00:53:16,433 --> 00:53:18,533
- It's cute. 
 - Cheers.

793
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:20,343
- You raised your glass, right? 
 - Yes, I'll take some.

794
00:53:20,343 --> 00:53:22,943
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

795
00:53:22,943 --> 00:53:25,083
What will you do?

796
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:30,693
Are you okay?

797
00:53:30,693 --> 00:53:32,383
What?

798
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:38,723
Gosh. No men get drunk by drinking only this much.

799
00:53:38,723 --> 00:53:42,703
You're lying. Your tongue is all twisted right now.

800
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:45,383
No.

801
00:53:45,383 --> 00:53:47,943
Why are you sweating so much, then?

802
00:53:47,943 --> 00:53:51,163
- Huh? 
 - You look like you're in a sauna.

803
00:53:51,163 --> 00:53:54,453
Whenever I feel awkward, I...

804
00:54:03,553 --> 00:54:05,413
Hold on.

805
00:54:06,273 --> 00:54:08,123
I'll do it.

806
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:11,153
Have you been to the Original Hotel?

807
00:54:11,153 --> 00:54:13,803
The restaurant with the Han River view is really nice.

808
00:54:13,803 --> 00:54:15,893
The Original?

809
00:54:15,893 --> 00:54:18,213
Did you mean the Oriental Hotel?

810
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,133
He said the Original. What an idiot.

811
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:23,923
The O.G. The Original Hotel.

812
00:54:23,923 --> 00:54:25,833
Gosh.

813
00:54:27,343 --> 00:54:29,103
Why are you drinking alone?

814
00:54:29,103 --> 00:54:31,273
Let's drink together.

815
00:54:31,273 --> 00:54:33,013
Cheers.

816
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:20,983
 Where did it go wrong? 

817
00:56:28,873 --> 00:56:37,933
♫  Where did we start drifting apart?  ♫

818
00:56:42,193 --> 00:56:49,283
♫  Can we go back to the beginning?  ♫

819
00:56:51,013 --> 00:56:54,553
♫  A stupid romance like this  ♫

820
00:56:54,553 --> 00:56:58,303
♫  A stupid breakup like this  ♫

821
00:56:58,303 --> 00:57:01,803
♫  Like a candle on the water  ♫

822
00:57:01,803 --> 00:57:06,033
♫  Just like a candle on the water  ♫

823
00:57:06,033 --> 00:57:09,063
♫  I trusted no one but you  ♫

824
00:57:09,063 --> 00:57:12,143
♫  You used to be on my side  ♫

825
00:57:12,143 --> 00:57:15,523
♫  Like a candle on the water  ♫

826
00:57:15,523 --> 00:57:20,043
♫  Just like a candle on the water  ♫

827
00:57:34,713 --> 00:57:39,053
   

828
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:48,290


829
00:57:49,273 --> 00:57:52,013
 Did you know love has an expiration date too? 

830
00:57:52,013 --> 00:57:56,263
 They say old couples stay together because of loyalty, not love. 

831
00:57:56,263 --> 00:57:58,653
 Will we end up like that, too? 

832
00:57:58,653 --> 00:58:01,213
 No, I won't be like that. 

833
00:58:01,213 --> 00:58:02,993
 Promise? 

834
00:58:02,993 --> 00:58:04,873
 Promise. 

835
00:58:05,763 --> 00:58:07,023
 You coward. 

836
00:58:07,023 --> 00:58:09,833
 Everyone knows you've been neglecting Seong Ok. 

837
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:11,703
 Why did you drink so much? 

838
00:58:11,703 --> 00:58:14,083
 Calling after getting drunk is the worst. 

839
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:16,173
 Don't give it back to me, even if I ask for it. 

840
00:58:16,173 --> 00:58:17,673
 I'm worried I'd call Seong Ok. 

841
00:58:17,673 --> 00:58:20,723
 How could you be like this? I'm hurting right now. 

842
00:58:20,723 --> 00:58:22,783
 I miss you, okay? 

843
00:58:23,783 --> 00:58:26,213
 How about you? Are you okay? 

844
00:58:26,213 --> 00:58:29,070
 What's wrong? Did something happen? 

845
00:58:29,953 --> 00:58:32,393
 I feel alive now. 

846
00:58:32,393 --> 00:58:34,003
 Isn't it hard? 

847
00:58:34,003 --> 00:58:37,883
 We've been together forever. How can we break up? 

848
00:58:39,033 --> 00:58:40,103
 Gosh. 

849
00:58:40,103 --> 00:58:44,143
 What do you think is crucial in a relationship? 

850
00:58:44,143 --> 00:58:48,183
 The tension that comes from the possibility that the other person might leave me. 

851
00:58:48,183 --> 00:58:49,543
 Jeong Hyeon Seong needs to know, too. 

852
00:58:49,543 --> 00:58:52,833
 To him, Seong Ok is a long-time girlfriend he feels comfortable with. 

853
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:56,283
 But she's someone new to other men. 

854
00:58:56,873 --> 00:58:59,353
 Seong Ok, let us...
