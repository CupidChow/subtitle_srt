Hey, Hyeon Seong.

00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,950
Let's grab a drink.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,470
Well, I'm a bit busy right now.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,800
What are you doing?

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,580
Who is it?

00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,600
Hello?

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,220
I'm at the store right now. Talk to you later.

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,410
Is something going on?

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,750
Well, the thing is-

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,020
It was Hyeon Seong, wasn't it?

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,710
Well, yes.

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,030
Is he doing well?

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,140
Well, yes.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,910
I see.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,150
- The thing is-
- Noona, should we order more stuff?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,260
Yes. Go ahead if you want something.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,190
Okay.

20
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,500
Why did you drink so fast? You should've drank slowly with me.

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,710
Sir, we'll have a 500 cc beer and a menu.

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,550
Your hoobae is so quick.

23
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,400
It's not that. I just care.

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,980
- Care?
- I just want to care for our designer.

25
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,870
Here we go again. You don't have to do that for me.

26
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,560
Come on. There's no designer better than you.

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,030
Thank you.

28
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,460
Right, I went to Winders today.

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,960
- Winders?
- Yes.

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,450
Jewelry A and Winders are discussing collaborating. Isn't that great?

31
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,070
Oh, right...

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,810

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,800
By the way,

34
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,220
did you hear anything about H2 by chance?

35
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,950
Oh...

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,790
H2's CEO turned us down, saying he created the brand with his girlfriend.

37
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,670
I suppose love overcame work.

38
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,640
They didn't say much.

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,350

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,100
Thank you.

41
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,360
Our beer's here. Should we raise glasses to celebrate working together?

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,680
Yes. Congratulations, Seong Ok.

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,750

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,520
What should we get? Do you want anything?

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,060
Instead of chicken-

47
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,040
I'll go to the restroom real quick.

What are you thinking about?

51
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,110
Your girlfriend?

52
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,180
I don't have one, I said.

53
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,750
Why? Because you're thinking of your boyfriend?

54
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,240
What are you saying? I don't have one, either.

55
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,290
What? You can't just drink alone like that.

56
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,560
I can have another one, then.

57
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,860
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

58
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,990
You heard it just now.

59
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,190
I opened the door.

60
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,800
I really am home.

61
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,760
I didn't drink a lot.

62
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,610
Yes. You should go to bed early, too.

63
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,350

Hey. How many times did I call you?

We just slept once. That's all.

69
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,230
Did I ask to go out with you?

70
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,510
I'm a piece of trash.

71

Are you sure it wasn't your girlfriend?

74
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,410
It's not.

75
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,460
Why? Do you want to check?

76

Don't trust people too easily.

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,460
By the way, isn't this too much?

186
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,430
It's okay.

187
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,320
Think of me whenever you use it instead.

188
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,750
Okay.

189
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,080
Let's take a picture, Noona.

190
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,920
I want to take my first one with you.

191
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,090
Okay.

192
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,400
Hey.

193
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,090
Take one of us.

194
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,870
- Me?
- Hurry.

195
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,970
Okay, here we go.

196
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,100
Gosh, why isn't Kim Hyeong Seob here?

197
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,900
- One, two...
- When I was 23 years old,

198
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,260
- three!
- I met Yoo Joo noona, who was 29 years old.

199
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,220
She was my first love.

200
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,940
Please. Please.

201
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,540
Okay!

202
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,530
Gosh, seriously.

203
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,410
Why is it so hard to get into classes?

204
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,690
I managed to get classes on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.

205
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,450
I can see you on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

206
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,870
Are you listening?

207
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,100
Hold on. I need to finish something by today. Let me finish it first.

208
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,120
I first realized then that someone could look so pretty while working.

209
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,440
Noona, let me take a photo.

210
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,870
What?

211
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,350
Did you take one?

212
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,940
Yeah. I wanted to take one since you looked cool working.

213
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,170
Why did you take a film photo? You can't check immediately.

214
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,210
But it's nice.

215
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,610
It makes you look forward to getting the picture printed.

216
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,900
It's easy to delete and retake on the phone,

217
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,670
but with this, I feel like you can truly capture the moment.

218
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,170
The atmosphere of the space we were in and the feelings from those moments.

219
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,820
I didn't want to lose any of those things.

220
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,470
What? I was totally zoned out.

221
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,390
I don't really like how you can't check immediately.

222
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,360
But you'd feel differently about this moment after time passes.

223
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,740
You're more of an old soul than I thought.

224
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,120
Should we go see a movie tonight?

225
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,580
You said you're seeing off a friend who's joining the military.

226
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,790
I'll see him when he's on vacation.

227
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,490
- I want to be with you.
- Come on.

228
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,610
Don't be like that and go see him.

229
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,480
They hold grudges if you disappoint someone leaving for the military.

230
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,010
But I want to be with you.

231
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,980
You should do as I say.

232
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,500
Hyeon Seong, good luck in the military.

233
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,720

Shi Hoo.

I know you're upset about Hyeon Seong joining the military, but still.

258
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,820

Gosh, you reek of alcohol. How much did you drink?

267
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,970
Well, you know, I wanted to stop drinking,

268
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,860
but my friends kept forcing me.

269
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,580
You shouldn't have drank all that. Seriously.

270
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,420
I was drunk on love those days.

271

Let's go home. I'll drive you.

No.

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,430

00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,910
- Let go!
- Give it to me!

362
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,980
I kept trying to think that way, but...

363
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,860
at some point, Hye Ryeong had become a total woman to me.

364
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,950
This is medicine. It's medicine.

365
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,240
Wow. This is crazy.

366
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,630
Did you drink again?

367
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,320
Don't take it too far.

368
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,410
How much longer will you be bummed out like that?

369
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:13,450
Geez. Who am I to say? Who am I?

370
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,100
Who am I to say?

371
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,090
- Hey, Oh Fatty.
- Yeah.

372
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,430
- Hey, Oh Fatty.
- What? Why do you keep calling me?

373
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:24,720
Do you post on an anonymous forum under your nickname?

374
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,540
- Did you see it?
- "What do you do when you develop feelings for your friend?

375
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,830
What's the likelihood of us becoming lovers?

376
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,020
How would you feel if your friend suddenly confessed love to you?"

377
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,970
Was it you who commented?

378
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,980
Do the other guys know, by chance?

379
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,650
No. Not yet.

380
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:51,100
Please, please, please. I beg you. Could you keep it to yourself?

381
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,970
Those jerks can't find out. I don't even want to think about it. Please.

382
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,800
Depending on your behavior.

383
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,360
Hold on.

384
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,690
Why were you browsing the relationship advice forum?

385
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,310
What are you saying?

386
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,990
- What?
- This was you.

387
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,960
"Broke up after dating for seven years.

388
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,320
I can't sleep because I'm afraid I'd have a dream about my ex-girlfriend."

389
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,250
That's not me.

390
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,160
That's not me. That's not me.

391
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,690
Do you think about Seong Ok and can't sleep?

392
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,900
No, no. I swear it's not me.

393
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,500
- "I'm afraid to fall asleep."
- Hey!

394
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,470
Hey. Just call her.

395
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,400
Don't regret it later once too much time passes.

396
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,910
I'll regret it more the moment I press the call button.

397
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:38,480
If you'd regret it if you do it or not,

398
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,830
just do it.

399
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,550
Isn't it better to regret it afterward?

400
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,460
- Will you do it and regret it?
- What would I do?

401
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,990
Her name is Kim Hye Ryeong, right? Your middle school classmate.

402
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,080
She has a tall, handsome, nice boyfriend.

403
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,170
How did you know that?

404
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:53,030
You said all that in here, punk.

405
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,710
Damn it!

406
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:02,690
By the way, why do you suddenly have feelings for your friend?

407
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,420
I don't know.

408
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,130
I really... I really don't know. I...

409
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,550
I think I'm crazy.

410
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:14,940
I even imagine her being at a motel with her boyfriend.

411
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,820
And I can't sleep whenever I think about that.

412
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,600
Wow, you're totally nuts.

413
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,580
I know I'm crazy, too, but...

414
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,830
Everything bothers me.

415
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,400
I understand.

416
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,960
Imagining someone I like being with someone else... Geez.

417
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,390
It really sucks.

418
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,520
But will you give up without telling her?

419
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,650
What if I tell her and get dumped?

420
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,100
What if we can't even stay friends? Will you take responsibility?

421
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,450
You said you think of her as a woman. You're already not friends.

422
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:58,430
Look. Let's say you stay friends with her.

423
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,670
Then you'd have to continue to see her dating.

424
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,540
Would you be able to?

425
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,090
- I can't.
- I knew it.

426
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,930
You're no longer friends with her, then.

427
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,910
You're the one who shouldn't regret it later. Go talk to her.

428
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,440
You said it's better to do it and regret it.

429
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,150
He's right. If there's no right answer anyway,

430
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,160
I decided to be honest with my feelings.

431
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,070
That way, I won't have regrets.

432
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,040
Yes.

433
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,280
Where are you?

434
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,880
Me? I'm dropping my students off.

435
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,480
Okay.

436
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,210
What?

437
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,440
It's Woo Ram's turn to get off.

438
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,400
Woo Ram's dad is here today.

439
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,060
Sir.

440
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,380
I knew you'd do this.

441
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,360
What? What do you mean?

442
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,770
You paid a lot for sushi last time.

443
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,870
You should've just let me treat you then.

444
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,080
I don't have money. Deal with it.

445
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,130
It's not like that.

446
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,250
I'm treating you today.

447
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,360
What? What are you plotting this time?

448
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,300
Your clothes look new.

449
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,120
Looks like you got your hair done, too.

450
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:01,100
By chance...

451
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,540
did you make money with crypto?

452
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,970
Never mind.

453
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,610
This is a place to come with a boyfriend.

454
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,090
Hey. Who drinks wine like that?

455
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,370
Huh?

456
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,150
Hye Ryeong.

457
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,000
- Say something if you called me.
- Yes, okay.

458
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,500
Well...

459
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,000
The thing is...

460
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,160
I like...

461
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,310
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, guys.

462
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,880
What? Is she that moved by what I said?

463
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,230
Sorry. I couldn't hear you because of the party popper. What did you say?

464
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,810
You couldn't hear it?

465
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:24,030
No. What did you say?

466
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,140
Well, the thing is...

467
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:32,450
What I was t-trying to say is...

468
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,250
I...

469
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,940
I was going to ask if something was going on.

470
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,170
You looked upset.

471
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,910
Yes.

472
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,110
Can you tell?

473
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,860
To be honest...

474
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,450
I broke up with Eun Woo.

475
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,660
What?

476
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:04,440
Geez, I'm embarrassed because I bragged too much to the guys.

477
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,790
Why? Why did you break up?

478
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,540
I suddenly couldn't reach him.

479
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,490
Did he ghost you?

480
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,670
Geez, I knew he was too good-looking.

481
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,620
Hey, what did I tell you?

482
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:23,040
I told you not to date someone because of their looks. I said that many times.

483
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,260
No.

484
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,730
It's not that.

485
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,660
Don't laugh.

486
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,990
He joined the military.

487
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,210
Sorry, sorry.

488
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,020
Don't laugh, I said.

489
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,060
I was really hurt by it.

490
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,910
Geez.

491
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,440
It might sound silly since we only dated for a short while.

492
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,090
But I really liked him.

493
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,940
Bastard.

494
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,430
He should've given me a hint, at least.

495
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,000
How could it end like this?

496
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,030
Hye Ryeong.

497
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,280
Do you want some of my steak?

498
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,190
You like stealing my food.

499
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,370
Do you want some?

500
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,240
Here.

501
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,030
Have some.

502
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,400
Thank you for keeping me company today.

503
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,330
I couldn't reach out since I didn't want the guys to ask me about Eun Woo.

504
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:11,300
But it was pretty neat that you showed up.

505
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,950
Just go ahead and eat.

506
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,020
I should. I'm hungry.

507
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:30,460
To be honest, I pretended I ate little when I dated him.

508
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,800
So I always had a second meal at home.

509
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,260
But it's nice feeling relaxed with you.

510
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,270
You'll be my friend forever, okay?

511
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,460
You'd better not betray me.

512
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:52,800
Seeing her being genuinely grateful to me for comforting her, I finally realized my position.

513
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,510
Yes. At least, for now...

514
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,960
Hey, Hye Ryeong.

515
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,360
What is it?

516
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:06,230
Try not to cry if you can help it.

517
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,450
Why?

518
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,750
Well, it's because...

519
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:14,460
You aren't all that pretty, to begin with,

520
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,840
but you look even uglier when you cry.

521
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,650
Seriously. I'll kill you.

522
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:23,280
I'll send it to everyone. I'll tell them Kim Hye Ryeong is crying after getting dumped.

523
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,170
Give that to me!

524
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,820
Delete it.

525
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,200
Delete it. Give me. Give it to me.

526
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,260
I should hide my feelings for now.

527
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,470
As long as we remain friends,

528
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:41,690
I'll surely find better timing.

529
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,170
I should die...

530
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,660
Are you okay?

531
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,610
No.

532
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,820
Sure. Why would you be okay?

533
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,220
Is it normally like this?

534
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:14,620
My heart really aches and sores.

535
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,480
Oh Fatty, you're all grown up now.

536
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,200
You know what it's like to be heartbroken now.

537
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,780
Do you feel the same?

538
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,990
Why ask? Cheers.

Geez. I'm touched.

Geez, it's okay, man.

Why did you take a shower in the middle of the night?

548

Adults have our own world you don't know about.

549

553
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,350
Shouldn't you take them out and sell them?

Hey. Don't you know he's nothing but pride?

555
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,040
He'd rather die than sell clothes out on the streets.

556
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,160
I'm sure he'd die from starving.

Okay. Why are you getting angry?

Hey. Oh Fatty doesn't know how to be moderate with food. I'll order.

Order one dish for now. It's not good to waste food.

Right. Did you hear Hye Ryeong broke up with her boyfriend?

Yes. I heard.
