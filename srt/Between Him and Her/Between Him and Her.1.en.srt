You didn't cut him off after letting him treat you-

290

Well, that was because I helped him once.

291
00:20:57,468 --> 00:21:01,178
And isn't it weird to respond to a text that late-

292
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:04,468
Hey. No one treats someone to beef without a goal.

293

To be nice, someone treats you to no more than pork. Frozen pork belly, to be exact.

294
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:13,398
It sounds like a proverb since you're saying it so seriously.

295
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,858
- Keep it in mind as if it's a proverb.
- Geez.

296

Keeping in touch with him can't hurt you.

So what? I'm just telling you to call him once.

299
00:21:24,928 --> 00:21:30,888

Really?

357
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:28,258
She blatantly swore at me.

358
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:29,998
I see...

359
00:25:29,998 --> 00:25:31,758
Really?

360
00:25:33,588 --> 00:25:35,838
I'm thinking of quitting my job.

361
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:40,408
- Hey.
- This looks good.

362
00:26:03,258 --> 00:26:04,838
What?

363
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:28,198
Geez, those bastards. They said they'd clean up.

364
00:26:29,828 --> 00:26:32,358
Why did you leave without me?

365
00:26:36,568 --> 00:26:37,968
Give me that. I'll do it.

366
00:26:37,968 --> 00:26:39,568
It's okay.

367
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:42,508
Come on. Let me do it.

368
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:47,418
Are you angry?

369
00:26:48,138 --> 00:26:49,398
Huh?

370
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:51,068
I'll do it. I'm good at doing the dishes. You know.

371
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,328
I need to do them again if you do.

372
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:22,238
Let's take a trip abroad, just the two of us, for our eighth anniversary.

373
00:27:22,238 --> 00:27:23,568
The place you wanted to go.

374
00:27:23,568 --> 00:27:26,348
You said that five years ago, too.

375
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:28,268
Oh, did I?

376
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:31,318
Let's actually go next year.

377
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:34,928
I always keep my promises even though it takes time, right?

378
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:36,558
Do you?

379
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:41,978
And let's go to a very expensive restaurant and get whatever you want.

380
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:43,598
Get expensive dishes without looking at the prices.

381
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:45,198
And should we stay at a hotel, too?

382
00:27:45,198 --> 00:27:48,308
What was the one you wanted to go to? Was it Croa-

383
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:49,578
Hyeon Seong.

384
00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:50,898
Huh?

385
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:55,488
I don't want you to make money and do something for me.

386
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:58,568
I just miss the way you used to be.

387
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:03,298
I'm sorry.

388
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:05,088
I swear I'll be good to you.

389
00:28:05,088 --> 00:28:07,648
You know me. I'm Jeong Hyeon Seong.

390
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:11,018
I know Jeong Hyeon Seong.

391
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:12,688
Huh?

392
00:28:12,688 --> 00:28:14,058
Huh?

393
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:16,578
Come here. Come here.

394
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:18,658
- Don't be mad.
- Don't bother.

395
00:28:18,658 --> 00:28:20,188
What's wrong?

396
00:28:21,478 --> 00:28:22,668
- I'll tickle you.
- Don't do it.

397
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:24,558
Why not? Don't be mad.

398
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:27,488
Don't be mad. Don't be mad! Don't be mad.

399
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:30,008
- Seriously, stop.
- What do you mean?

400
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,698
Don't be mad.

401
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:34,348
- Don't be mad.
- Stop that. Seriously!

402
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:35,528
Don't do it.

403
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:37,418
I haven't started it. I'll start now.

404
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:39,378
- I will.
- Seriously!

405
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:41,168
Come on.

406
00:28:41,168 --> 00:28:42,898
- Seriously, don't do it.
- Are you mad?

407
00:28:42,898 --> 00:28:44,118
- Seriously, don't.
- Are you still mad?

408
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:46,058
- No, no, no.
- You're not, right?

409
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:56,448
Did you bring it?

410
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,098
Let's start for now.

411
00:28:59,748 --> 00:29:02,098
Bring it. Right now.

412
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:15,938
<i>Damn it. When did I shave? I didn't even think of checking.</i>

413
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:20,258
- Let's turn the lights off.
- Huh?

414
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:22,498
Why?

415
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:25,398
Let's just do it. You like doing it while looking at each other.

416
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:31,758
I said let's turn it off.

417
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:48,698
<i>Kill yourself, Han Seong Ok.</i>

418
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:54,488
- Do you want to do it from behind?
- Why?

419
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:56,748
You don't want to see my face?

420
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:58,428
No...

421
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:00,978
It's nothing.

422
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:47,618
<i>Hey, Yong Min is starting the game tonight. I'll bring fried chicken.</i>

423
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:56,198
Hey. You ignored my texts, but you're looking at your phone right after?

424
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:58,308
What?

425
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:00,798
It's not like that.

426
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:13,228
I love you.

427
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:31,418
Why don't you answer?

428
00:31:35,568 --> 00:31:37,928
Whatever. Let's get up now.

429
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:40,798
Hug me a little longer.

430
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,458
- I can't.
- Why not?

431
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,148
The guys are coming.

432
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:47,918
What?

433
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:51,218
Yong Min is starting the game today. That's okay, right?

434
00:32:08,998 --> 00:32:10,708
What?

435
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,748
Hey. Put your clothes on.

436
00:32:14,748 --> 00:32:17,118
Do you want everyone to know we did it?

437
00:32:34,098 --> 00:32:36,138
How did this fall here?

438
00:32:36,138 --> 00:32:37,758
I should put it away before they come.

439
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:41,678
<i>Ding-dong! Here comes the fried chicken!</i>

440
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:45,488
Look. They're doing three back since four back won't work.

441
00:32:45,488 --> 00:32:47,748
What are you saying? Look. That's the best.

442
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:49,438
Hey, hey, hey. The center forward will be good today, too.

443
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:51,118
What are you talking about?

444
00:32:51,118 --> 00:32:53,488
There are no midfielders to support, okay?

445
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:55,738
Hey, he's... He's good, okay?

446
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:58,118
<i>I got pushed away by friends,</i>

447
00:32:58,118 --> 00:33:00,138
<i>work, and now...</i>

448
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:03,438
<i>I'm no better than soccer.</i>

449
00:33:04,788 --> 00:33:05,998
Shoot!

450
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:09,118
<i>- Gosh.
- Geez!</i>

451
00:33:09,118 --> 00:33:11,628
Gosh, it's so frustrating. If only they did that once...

452
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:13,238
- Shit.
- They could've done it just once.

453
00:33:13,238 --> 00:33:15,588
Why do it twice?

454
00:33:15,588 --> 00:33:18,198
That's his habit. Seriously.

455
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:19,348
<i>He's running!</i>

456
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:20,968
Look at him.

457
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:25,088
- Shoot!
- Goal!

458
00:33:26,968 --> 00:33:28,938
I told you, right? Right?

459
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:30,568
Daebak.

460
00:33:34,828 --> 00:33:35,958
Alright!

461
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,758
What are you doing, Seong Ok? Let's drink.

462
00:33:38,758 --> 00:33:40,248
Let's drink.

463
00:33:40,248 --> 00:33:41,438
Put your hand away.

464
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:43,268
- Wow.
- Gosh.

465
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:45,658
Madam Ok, you're a bit grumpy today.

466
00:33:45,658 --> 00:33:47,978
- Yes.
- Let's have a drink.

467
00:33:47,978 --> 00:33:50,298
Here. Let's drink. Come on.

468
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:52,398
You drink all you want.

469
00:33:53,188 --> 00:33:54,508
Hey.

470
00:33:55,498 --> 00:33:57,888
Geez. Don't be like that. Cheers.

471
00:33:57,888 --> 00:33:59,588
I said I don't want to drink.

472
00:33:59,588 --> 00:34:03,848
<i>Wow, Son Heung Min and his amazing animal instinct...</i>

473
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:05,668
Talk to me for a second.

474
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:09,258
<i>That was a perfect closing to the game.</i>

475
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:11,998
<i>The first half has ended.</i>

476
00:34:11,998 --> 00:34:14,308
- What's the problem?
- What?

477
00:34:14,308 --> 00:34:15,808
What do you mean by what?

478
00:34:15,808 --> 00:34:17,388
Why do you look so pissed?

479
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,348
When did I?

480
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,338
The guys are here, too. Must you do this?

481
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:22,428
Do you care more about them?

482
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:24,618
What? That's not what I'm saying.

483
00:34:24,618 --> 00:34:26,848
What are you saying, then?

484
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:30,458
What are you so unhappy about?

485
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,388
Don't you know how you've been acting all day?

486
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:35,088
- You're saying I'm the problem, right?
- What?

487
00:34:39,428 --> 00:34:41,948
I did something wrong again, didn't I?

488
00:34:41,948 --> 00:34:43,968
What are you unhappy about?

489
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:46,858
Is it because I didn't care for you when I was working at the cafe?

490
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:49,118
Do you not want me to work, then?

491
00:34:49,118 --> 00:34:50,738
What?

492
00:34:50,738 --> 00:34:53,228
You think I'm like this for no reason?

493
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:57,768
You're acting annoying right now.

494
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,258
Don't you think you do?

495
00:35:01,258 --> 00:35:03,838
What did I do? Do you think I'm not fed up?

496
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:05,238
Hey.

497
00:35:06,608 --> 00:35:09,188
Have you recently...

498
00:35:10,148 --> 00:35:12,658
Have you ever thought about me once?

499
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:15,508
Hey, that's...

500
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:21,918
Hey.

501
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:32,218
Han Seong Ok!

502
00:35:42,148 --> 00:35:43,998
<i>We're entering the second half of the game.</i>

503
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:47,288
- Was that the only reason?
- Only?

504
00:35:53,263 --> 00:35:55,278
Never mind.

505
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,538
I should've thrown it away properly.

506
00:35:57,538 --> 00:35:59,808
I'm sorry. I was careless.

507
00:36:03,148 --> 00:36:05,078
I'm sorry about everything.

508
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:07,788
So let's make up and go inside.

509
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,068
I've been busy with work lately.

510
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:18,248
So I didn't care about your feelings. I'm sorry.

511
00:36:18,248 --> 00:36:21,068
I don't want to fight with you.

512
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:22,508
Let's go.

513
00:36:24,008 --> 00:36:25,668
No.

514
00:36:27,548 --> 00:36:28,828
I've been sensitive lately, too.

515
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:31,008
Yes. Let's go inside.

516
00:36:31,008 --> 00:36:33,868
Let's go inside and have fun as if nothing happened.

517
00:36:33,868 --> 00:36:35,598
Yong Min scored, too.

518
00:36:35,598 --> 00:36:37,768
Let's go in. Let's go.

519
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:42,068
No. I'll just go home now.

520
00:36:42,068 --> 00:36:43,258
Please explain to everyone.

521
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:44,868
What is it now?

522
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:48,668
Hey. You can't just leave like this.

523
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:52,018
If you leave now, we're over. We're seriously over.

524
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:08,638
Did you say we're over?

525
00:37:09,388 --> 00:37:12,088
- Huh?
- You said...

526
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:14,588
- we're over, right?
- Don't be like that.

527
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:17,288
- How are we supposed to break up?
- And if we don't?

528
00:37:17,288 --> 00:37:18,398
What?

529
00:37:19,038 --> 00:37:21,168
Will you marry me?

530
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:25,688
Are we getting married?

531
00:37:35,368 --> 00:37:36,768
What?

532
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:40,648
Looks like you never even thought about it.

533
00:37:40,648 --> 00:37:42,448
I mean...

534
00:37:46,158 --> 00:37:49,208
Well, it's just so sudden.

535
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,548
Forget it.

536
00:37:51,258 --> 00:37:53,658
I didn't mean it, either.

537
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,678
By chance...

538
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:07,438
Is there something going on with you?

539
00:38:07,438 --> 00:38:08,688
Why?

540
00:38:09,308 --> 00:38:11,678
Are you worried I got pregnant or something?

541
00:38:21,808 --> 00:38:23,788
Don't worry.

542
00:38:23,788 --> 00:38:27,068
I won't make you stay for something like that.

543
00:38:32,598 --> 00:38:33,838
Hey!

544
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,118
Han Seong Ok!

545
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:39,868
Gosh.

546
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:46,458
This is driving me crazy.

547
00:39:07,618 --> 00:39:09,688
[8th - Seventh-anniversary party, 10th - Winders meeting, Fighting]

548
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:23,768
<i>I've been distant lately because of work.</i>

549
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:25,478
<i>You understand that, right?</i>

550
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,668
[I've been distant lately because of work. You understand that, right?]

551
00:39:45,188 --> 00:39:48,048
<i>No, I was too...</i>

552
00:39:57,158 --> 00:39:59,468
<i>Good luck with your meeting today.</i>

553
00:40:05,178 --> 00:40:06,818
<i>Okay.</i>

554
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:08,448
<i>Thank you.</i>

555
00:40:16,698 --> 00:40:19,668
<i>Let's go to Neverland after the meeting.</i>

556
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:21,788
<i>To celebrate our seventh anniversary.</i>

557
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:27,528
[Let's go to Neverland after the meeting. To celebrate our seventh anniversary.]

558
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:38,588
Do you have some good news?

559
00:40:39,298 --> 00:40:41,298
No. It's nothing.

560
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:45,488
<i>When are you free?</i>

561
00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:48,238
<i>Should we get a drink? I know a nice place.</i>

562
00:40:48,878 --> 00:40:52,808
[Let's go to Neverland after the meeting. To celebrate our seventh anniversary.]

563
00:40:57,028 --> 00:41:00,988
[Winders]

564
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:08,428
Wow. The fashion design department's pride. Jeong Hyeon Seong.

565
00:41:08,428 --> 00:41:11,108
You're just as handsome. You've been well, right?

566
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:13,538
- Yes, CEO Park.
- Hey, don't call me that.

567
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,488
Just call me "Hyung."

568
00:41:15,488 --> 00:41:17,478
Sunbae, long time no see.

569
00:41:17,478 --> 00:41:19,038
You've been well, right?

570
00:41:19,038 --> 00:41:20,478
Of course, I have.

571
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,368
I didn't know you worked here.

572
00:41:22,368 --> 00:41:25,518
Okay. Enough with pleasantries.

573
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:27,298
Have you thought about it?

574
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,248
Yes.

575
00:41:30,248 --> 00:41:33,978
As you said, I think joining Winders

576
00:41:33,978 --> 00:41:37,368
will help H2 be exposed to more diverse customers.

577
00:41:37,368 --> 00:41:42,198
So, I've been thinking about how to introduce H2.

578
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:44,118
Just one second.

579
00:41:44,118 --> 00:41:45,698
So...

580
00:41:47,658 --> 00:41:50,058
If you see this, it says...

581
00:41:50,058 --> 00:41:54,278
"H2 is a native brand that leads the street fashion culture.

582
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:58,418
Foreign brands are dominating the street fashion market-"

583
00:42:01,108 --> 00:42:04,198
I trust you. Isn't that all we need?

584
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:08,188
- Pardon?
- Myeong Jin recommended you with great enthusiasm.

585
00:42:08,188 --> 00:42:11,068
You were the senior I looked up to the most.

586
00:42:11,068 --> 00:42:13,018
Wow. How heartwarming.

587
00:42:13,018 --> 00:42:17,048
A successful junior is supporting the senior he respects.

588
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:21,298
Since we're on the topic, H2 has good designs and a loyal fan base.

589
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:24,348
That's all nice, but it doesn't make enough profit.

590
00:42:24,348 --> 00:42:26,158
Don't insist on high-quality fabrics.

591
00:42:26,158 --> 00:42:29,298
Cost-effectiveness is priority number one and two.

592
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:31,478
Oh, I see.

593
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:35,758
Yes. I'll take care of the business side.

594
00:42:35,758 --> 00:42:38,458
Here. Let's make this work together.

595
00:42:42,658 --> 00:42:45,848
[Business Contract]

596
00:42:47,538 --> 00:42:49,148
What's this...

597
00:42:50,148 --> 00:42:52,028
Will I not be designing?

598
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,118
We have Myeong Jin.

599
00:42:53,118 --> 00:42:56,028
Let us design. It'll be the same if you put the H2 tag on it.

600
00:42:56,028 --> 00:42:57,878
You don't have to worry about the quality.

601
00:42:57,878 --> 00:42:59,278
I learned a lot from you.

602
00:42:59,278 --> 00:43:00,848
I mean...

603
00:43:01,848 --> 00:43:04,388
I come up with the designs and choose fabrics for H2-

604
00:43:04,388 --> 00:43:06,058
I told you just now.

605
00:43:06,058 --> 00:43:09,258
Cost-effectiveness. No one puts effort into designing these days.

606
00:43:09,258 --> 00:43:12,828
Finding trendy items abroad is way cheaper.

607
00:43:12,828 --> 00:43:16,298
Hey. Just sign it. I'll make you money.

608
00:43:16,298 --> 00:43:20,068
Wow, I can't believe I'll be working with Jeong Hyeon Seong.

609
00:43:20,068 --> 00:43:21,618
Myeong Jin, thank you.

610
00:43:21,618 --> 00:43:23,058
You're welcome.

611
00:43:23,718 --> 00:43:25,458
Don't we have a pen?

612
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:30,538
It's cooler to sign a contract with a cheap pen.

613
00:43:30,538 --> 00:43:31,858
Here.

614
00:43:36,148 --> 00:43:40,148
And we're only releasing the fashion line, okay?

615
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:42,398
Pardon?

616
00:43:42,398 --> 00:43:43,798
How about the jewelry, then?

617
00:43:43,798 --> 00:43:45,768
We have our jewelry business department.

618
00:43:45,768 --> 00:43:48,678
We agreed to only release the fashion line.

619
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:54,618
- CEO Park.
- Come on. I told you to call me Hyung.

620
00:43:56,898 --> 00:43:58,298
I won't do it.

621
00:43:58,298 --> 00:44:02,088
- What?
- This isn't exactly what I envisioned.

622
00:44:02,088 --> 00:44:03,488
What you envisioned?

623
00:44:04,128 --> 00:44:07,308
I explained things nicely, but you don't get it.

624
00:44:07,308 --> 00:44:09,398
Jeong Hyeon Seong, won't you make money?

625
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:11,248
You still don't know why H2 isn't a success?

626
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,638
I do.

627
00:44:12,638 --> 00:44:15,028
I know better than anyone.

628
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:17,418
But H2 is a brand Seong Ok and I...

629
00:44:18,418 --> 00:44:21,148
created together by working hard.

630
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:23,798
I can't abandon the jewelry line.

631
00:44:23,798 --> 00:44:26,328
Seong Ok? Who's that?

632
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:29,668
- Do you know her?
- You mean your girlfriend?

633
00:44:30,428 --> 00:44:32,538
I didn't think you'd still be with her.

634
00:44:32,538 --> 00:44:34,418
They've been together while we were in school.

635
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:35,638
Everyone at school knew.

636
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:39,518
Hey, we're discussing business. But you're saying you won't because of your girlfriend?

637
00:44:39,518 --> 00:44:42,008
She's not just a girlfriend.

638
00:44:42,008 --> 00:44:44,288
H2 is us, and...

639
00:44:45,298 --> 00:44:47,358
we are H2.

640
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:49,778
I'll get going if you're finished.

641
00:44:55,058 --> 00:44:57,688
Hey, Jeong Hyeon Seong.

642
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,958
What the hell did he just say?

643
00:45:08,778 --> 00:45:11,978
<i>The main concept is the skateboard's unique image.</i>

644
00:45:11,978 --> 00:45:14,828
To create an image that's energetic and free

645
00:45:14,828 --> 00:45:18,248
that fits a street wear brand. That's one of them.

646
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,368
The goal is to come up with H2's unique image.

647
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:26,418
I'm H2's designer, Jeong Hyeon Seong.

648
00:45:26,418 --> 00:45:29,048
[Thank you]

649
00:45:29,048 --> 00:45:30,128
That was cool.

650
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:32,438
Why is it H2, by the way?

651
00:45:33,488 --> 00:45:36,038
"Hip to human."

652
00:45:36,038 --> 00:45:40,418
It means we aspire to a trendiness that's devoted to humanity.

653
00:45:40,418 --> 00:45:43,058
Wow. That's pretty clever.

654
00:45:43,058 --> 00:45:47,308
Actually, there's a more important meaning than that.

655
00:45:47,308 --> 00:45:48,718
What is it?

656
00:45:48,718 --> 00:45:51,598
H as in Han Seong Ok.

657
00:45:51,598 --> 00:45:53,918
And H, as in Hyeon Seong.

658
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:57,108
It means it's a brand created by the two of us.

659
00:45:58,128 --> 00:46:00,408
No matter what happens,

660
00:46:00,408 --> 00:46:02,328
I'll make sure to protect it.

661
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:05,308

Huh? Of course I am.

680

- What are you doing?
- Well...

681
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:21,618
It's a new season.

682
00:47:21,618 --> 00:47:23,898
I should get started again.

683
00:47:25,988 --> 00:47:28,088
Oh, do you want coffee?

684
00:47:28,088 --> 00:47:29,698
I got some milk.

685
00:47:29,698 --> 00:47:31,128
Okay.

686
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,038
Iced?

687
00:47:44,468 --> 00:47:47,558
I haven't had coffee you made in a while.

688
00:47:48,818 --> 00:47:52,098
I fell for you seeing you making coffee from behind.

689
00:47:52,098 --> 00:47:53,508
Did I tell you?

690
00:47:53,508 --> 00:47:58,378
You made me coffee every morning when you lived in the studio apartment.

691
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:01,288
It was fun watching you from behind.

692
00:48:01,288 --> 00:48:03,058
I liked the coffee you made, too.

693
00:48:03,058 --> 00:48:04,308
Hot!

694
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:06,298
Are you okay?

695
00:48:06,938 --> 00:48:07,918
- Gosh.
- Let me see.

696
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,808
Hey!

697
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,658
Seriously.

698
00:48:15,048 --> 00:48:16,678
You should've been careful.

699
00:48:16,678 --> 00:48:18,648
What would you do without me?

700
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:20,498
But you're here.

701
00:48:21,528 --> 00:48:23,498
How can you smile now?

702
00:48:23,498 --> 00:48:26,258
Keep doing it. I'll look for an ointment.

703
00:48:26,258 --> 00:48:28,508
- Seong Ok.
- Yes?

704
00:48:30,438 --> 00:48:32,568
You know Winders?

705
00:48:33,898 --> 00:48:35,568
I decided not to do it.

706
00:48:35,568 --> 00:48:36,848
What?

707
00:48:37,608 --> 00:48:38,728
Why?

708
00:48:39,388 --> 00:48:42,908
I can't bring myself to make only trendy clothes.

709
00:48:43,938 --> 00:48:45,718
What's wrong with trends?

710
00:48:46,368 --> 00:48:47,798
What do you think a trend is?

711
00:48:47,798 --> 00:48:50,708
Isn't it what people like?

712
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:53,658
What's wrong with making clothes that people like?

713
00:48:53,658 --> 00:48:57,798
You also said it's meaningless if the consumers don't choose the product.

714
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:00,758
Isn't that why you worked on joining Winders?

715
00:49:00,758 --> 00:49:04,208
I thought I could, but...

716
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,948
I realized I couldn't when I was there.

717
00:49:05,948 --> 00:49:08,718
I can't work for someone else, either.

718
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,938
Do you think I like working for someone else?

719
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,308
What?

720
00:49:21,308 --> 00:49:24,528
Why do you think I got a job giving up on designing?

721
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,008
Don't you remember?

722
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:31,238
Or did you think it was only fair because you think you're superior?

723
00:49:37,138 --> 00:49:38,608
Seong Ok, it's not like that.

724
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,848
What is it, then? I did it for our future.

725
00:49:41,848 --> 00:49:44,218
How could you always be so selfish?

726
00:49:44,218 --> 00:49:48,818
Shouldn't you have decided after discussing it with me, at least?

727
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:50,488
Seong Ok, calm down and listen to me-

728
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,618
Hyeon Seong, have you ever...

729
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:57,068
thought about us, not just you?

730
00:49:57,868 --> 00:50:00,078
Have you ever...

731
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:05,278
thought about our future seriously even once?

732
00:50:08,378 --> 00:50:09,838
Wow.

733
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:12,278
Are you saying I only care about myself?

734
00:50:12,278 --> 00:50:14,108
Aren't you?

735
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:18,658
Fine.

736
00:50:18,658 --> 00:50:22,178
That's what happened because I'm such a bloody selfish bastard. Okay?

737
00:50:23,628 --> 00:50:27,638
Does H2 joining Winders only concern you?

738
00:50:27,638 --> 00:50:29,768
What am I to you, exactly?

739
00:50:29,768 --> 00:50:32,458
Am I someone who makes money and pays the rent?

740
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:34,298
- Is this about the rent?
- What?

741
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:37,308
Is it because you're upset you've been paying rent?

742
00:50:37,308 --> 00:50:39,148
I can pay you back for all of it!

743
00:50:39,148 --> 00:50:41,108
No...

744
00:50:41,108 --> 00:50:45,358
I'm not asking you to pay me that money back. I'm just...

745
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:50,548
I'm just asking you to think about me at least once.

746
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:54,048
What more am I supposed to do? Shit. Seriously.

747
00:50:55,978 --> 00:50:57,278
What?

748
00:51:06,198 --> 00:51:09,748
Let's stop now. My head hurts. Okay?

749
00:51:11,058 --> 00:51:14,668
I guess acting like this with you gives you a headache, huh?

750
00:51:14,668 --> 00:51:16,478
Please!

751
00:51:18,088 --> 00:51:20,418
Let's stop, I said.

752
00:51:20,418 --> 00:51:22,928
It's already over.

753
00:51:23,678 --> 00:51:26,738
What's the point of us fighting right now?

754
00:51:29,408 --> 00:51:31,098
There's no point.

755
00:51:32,538 --> 00:51:34,978
It means nothing at all.

756
00:51:34,978 --> 00:51:38,768
I should go. I don't know what I'm doing here when I mean nothing at all.

757
00:51:38,768 --> 00:51:40,408
Hey, Han Seong Ok.

758
00:51:51,048 --> 00:51:54,518
Gosh. Never mind. Go.

759
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:19,558
Hey, I feel awful today. Let's drink.

760
00:52:19,558 --> 00:52:20,858
Hurry up. Cheers.

761
00:52:20,858 --> 00:52:23,368
- Hurry.
- Cheers.

762
00:52:29,588 --> 00:52:32,108
We won't take a break. Take more.

763
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:34,568
Cheers.

764
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,608
- Hurry!
- Come on.

765
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:41,908
What's wrong with him today?

766
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,208
He rejected Unders.

767
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:44,658
Under...

768
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:47,508
Winders.

769
00:52:47,508 --> 00:52:49,968
- It's Winders. Winders.
- Winders?

770
00:52:50,748 --> 00:52:52,128
Gosh, how about my car?

771
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:54,578
Geez. He hasn't gotten his act together yet.

772
00:52:54,578 --> 00:52:57,828
He'll have to get beaten by Seong Ok, right?

773
00:52:57,828 --> 00:52:59,188
Is Seong Ok beating Hyeon Seong up?

774
00:52:59,188 --> 00:53:00,288
Not allowed to bring her up.

775
00:53:00,288 --> 00:53:04,328
- What if she ends up quitting her job-
- Seong Ok...

776
00:53:04,328 --> 00:53:06,018
Don't mention her name.

777
00:53:06,018 --> 00:53:07,148
Okay.

778
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,788
- Seong Ok.
- Shit.

779
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,348
Cheers. Gosh.

780
00:53:13,098 --> 00:53:14,468
Cheers.

781
00:53:14,468 --> 00:53:16,168
Cheers.

782
00:53:22,808 --> 00:53:26,408
Hey, the girl I asked for a phone number is nearby with her friends now.

783
00:53:26,408 --> 00:53:28,098
Should I invite them? Should I?

784
00:53:28,098 --> 00:53:29,578
Why? Let's just keep it to ourselves-

785
00:53:29,578 --> 00:53:31,558
Wow, Hyeong Seob is paying.

786
00:53:31,558 --> 00:53:33,138
That isn't the problem right now.

787
00:53:33,138 --> 00:53:35,988
- It's a serious problem.
- You're like Santa Claus.

788
00:53:35,988 --> 00:53:38,488
You mean Scrooge. What's wrong with you?

789
00:53:39,488 --> 00:53:43,398
Gosh, I would've dolled up if I would've known.

790
00:53:44,398 --> 00:53:47,198
What's the point of a pig getting dolled up?

791
00:53:47,198 --> 00:53:48,588
Hey.

792
00:53:48,588 --> 00:53:51,868
- Take your couple's ring off.
- Why invite women?

793
00:53:51,868 --> 00:53:53,638
Take it off, I said.

794
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,278
You're crazy about women.

795
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,068
Well, Hyeon Seong.

796
00:54:03,418 --> 00:54:06,688
- Take it off.
- Let's just hang out by ourselves. Cheers.

797
00:54:06,688 --> 00:54:08,688
- It's cute.
- Cheers.

798
00:54:08,688 --> 00:54:10,498
- You raised your glass, right?
- Yes, I'll take some.

799
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:13,198
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

800
00:54:13,198 --> 00:54:15,038
What will you do?

801
00:54:18,468 --> 00:54:20,148
Are you okay?

802
00:54:20,868 --> 00:54:22,238
What?

803
00:54:24,138 --> 00:54:28,878
Gosh. No men get drunk by drinking only this much.

804
00:54:28,878 --> 00:54:32,658
You're lying. Your tongue is all twisted right now.

805
00:54:33,488 --> 00:54:35,538
No.

806
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:38,198
Why are you sweating so much, then?

807
00:54:38,198 --> 00:54:41,418
- Huh?
- You look like you're in a sauna.

808
00:54:41,418 --> 00:54:44,308
Whenever I feel awkward, I...

809
00:54:53,808 --> 00:54:55,368
Hold on.

810
00:54:56,428 --> 00:54:58,278
I'll do it.

811
00:54:58,278 --> 00:55:01,308
Have you been to the Original Hotel?

812
00:55:01,308 --> 00:55:03,958
The restaurant with the Han River view is really nice.

813
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:05,348
The Original?

814
00:55:06,078 --> 00:55:08,368
Did you mean the Oriental Hotel?

815
00:55:08,368 --> 00:55:11,388
He said the Original. What an idiot.

816
00:55:11,388 --> 00:55:14,178
The O.G. The Original Hotel.

817
00:55:14,178 --> 00:55:15,588
Gosh.

818
00:55:17,598 --> 00:55:19,258
Why are you drinking alone?

819
00:55:19,258 --> 00:55:20,728
Let's drink together.

820
00:55:21,438 --> 00:55:22,768
