00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,430
Kitchen assistant? Clean-cut type?

183
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,570
I'll have to get a haircut. No, no.

(Nickname for Hyeong Seob, it also means "sad" or "disappointed")

185
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,830
Hello? It's me.

186
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,170
Are you guys hiring a part-timer, by chance?

187
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,040
Why? Does someone want to?

188
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,420
- I want to.
- We're already done hiring.

189
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,400
- When?
- Not long ago.

190
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,720
What makes you want to wait tables all of a sudden?

191
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,470
By the way, are you okay? Do you want to get a drink?

192
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,640
Hey, drink, my foot.

193
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,500
Hang up if you won't hire me.

194
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,560
That's a relief, then. Talk to you later.

She's my girlfriend, Han Seong Ok.

206
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,250
You've got to be kidding.

207

- Hello!

209
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,940
Nice to meet you.

210
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,640
- Are you jealous?
- Gosh, I'm so jealous.

211
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,600
- Oh...
- Seriously.

212
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,670
Thank you.

213
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,180
You guys should start dating, too.

214
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,550
Should we talk casually?

215
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,590
Yes, okay. Both of us.

216
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,810
Are you serious?

217
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,430
The dim sums are so good here.

218
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,330
Can I come again sometime?

219
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,040
Yes, of course, you can.

220
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,020
Uncle! Get us ten more baskets of shrimp dim sum.

221
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,760
Alright! 10 baskets of shrimp dim sum.

222
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,190
How did you know I like shrimp?

223
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,490
You're so observant.

224
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,720
You must be popular, right?

225
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,710
Not really.

226
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,140
What's this? What are you guys talking about?

227
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,960
It's a secret between Hyeong Seob and me.

228
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,670
What? What's going on?

229
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,750
What is this, a soap opera?

230
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,210
Did you guys get close that quickly?

231
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,890
Yes. He and I have a lot in common.

232
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,210
Well, I mean...

233
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,180
What? Hyeong Seob's face is about to explode.

234
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,480
Gosh, you are forever single.

235
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,700
Hey, your ears are totally red.

236
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,320
Hey, you're forever single.

237
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,520
Your ears are red.

238
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,580
They're seriously red.

239
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,190
He sure is forever single.

240
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,860
- Why?
- He's been single for 20 years.

241
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,000
Yes. It's not like I'm acting trashy.

242
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,860
Yes, Geon Yeob.

243
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,420
You mean it, right?

244
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,710
Yes, let's work together.

245
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,040
Let's see. Let's have a welcoming party today.

246
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,980
Where are you?

247
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,470
I'm doing something right now. I'm outside.

248
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,230
Oh, really?

249
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,140
It'd be a shame to let a day like today go.

250
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,830
I'll call you. Let's meet up soon.

251
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,520
Okay, Noona. Call me.

252
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,160
Okay.

253
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,670
It's hard enough to tell all of my friends we broke up.

254
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,480
Did I have to tell the real estate agent, too?

255
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,640
That lady is seriously nosy.

256
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,190
Why are you looking at me?

257
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,570
I won't say anything anymore.

258
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,290
By the way, why are you suddenly moving?

259
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,320
It's not because of Jeong Hyeon Seong, right?

260
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,980
No. Not at all.

261
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,320
Should we meet up if you're free?

262
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,900
What?

263
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,900
- Are you still talking to "Are you sleeping" oppa?
- No.

264
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,280
It's just a friend.

265
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,470
Hey. What if that oppa thinks you guys started dating that night?

266
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,770
Give it. I'll take care of it for you.

267
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,040
You need to make things very clear with men.

268
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,450
It's Hyeong Seob.

269
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,270
Do you miss Hyeon Seong again?

270
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,480
No.

271
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,020
You're not trying to ask how he's doing through friends, right?

272
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,460
You're making me so sad.

273
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,270
It's not like that.

274
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,090
I quit my job.

275
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,850
So soon?

276
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,870
You've really been enduring your job for Hyeon Seong.

277
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,830
It's not like that.

278
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,040
I was actually offered a job as a designer.

279
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,980
What? Daebak!

280
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,400
Hey, why would you tell me that now? Where at?

281
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,470
They're called Jewelry A.

282
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,040
You probably won't know. It's a new company.

283
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,410
My hoobae works there as a merchandiser.

284
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,950
Wow, that's great.

285
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,700
Hey. Order whatever you want.

286
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,000
No, should we go somewhere else instead?

287
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,560
This must be good for me, right?

288
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,240
Of course, it is.

289
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,620
You're cool, Han Seong Ok.

290
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,880
Get a lot of experience there and launch Ok Jewelry later.

291
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,100
You know I'd be your model, right?

292
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,470
Yes.

293
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,000
Thank you.

294
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,600
When is Oh Fatty coming?

295
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,530
He said he won't come if you're here.

296
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,790
He's probably working.

297
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:56,590
We need him to grill meat perfectly.

298
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,510
He's best at grilling.

299
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,300
Did you gain weight?

300
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,670
Me?

301
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,920
What's this? Kim Hye Ryeong was here.

302
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,630
Oh? Oh Fatty is here.

303
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,520
I heard you said you won't come if I'm here.

304
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,180
Me? N-No, that's not true.

305
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,900
Are you mad at me about something?

306
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,080
I said it's not like that.

307
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,900
What? You're acting strange today, Pig.

308
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,820
There's really something going on.

309
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,350
I said it's not like that.

310
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,460
How could there be anything going on between me and her?

311
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,180
You'd better talk it out if there's something going on.

312
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,180
Because we need to drink together.

313
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,330
I don't know what's going on, but let's shake hands and move on.

314

315
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,060
Should we clank glasses?

316
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,230
Okay. Pour me some.

317
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,670
Why is it so soft?

318
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,510
Cheers!

319
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,870
Oh, right! Jjang Ji, check this out. I ate this at Soondae Town.

320
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,960
This is two servings?

321
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,890
That's crazy. We need to go.

322
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,460
Isn't it amazing?

323
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,090
Is eating all you ever think about?

324
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,050
Yes. Don't we work to feed ourselves?

325
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,530
What's more important than eating in this world?

326
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,620
Oh, I read this once somewhere.

327
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:41,060
Men have dirty thoughts as often as women think about food.

328
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,930
Do you have dirty thoughts that often?

329
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,190
How can you do everyday tasks?

330
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,660
That's what I want to ask you. Seriously.

331
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,060
Are you having a dirty thought right now?

332
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,840
What are you saying? I'm not, okay?

333
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,510
Gosh, don't be so messy.

334
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,850
It's tasty.

335
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,850
[I need your advice regarding my female friend]

336
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,400
Stop thinking about it and ask her directly.

337
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Yes. It's your loss to hide your feelings.

338
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,860
You need to take action to win love.

339
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,120
I'd tell her rather than regretting later.

340
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,580
Yes. Let's ask her.

341
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,820
Boo Ri, don't you want a cigarette break?

342
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,350
- I quit.
- What?

343
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,810
Really? Why?

344
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,570
The thing is...

345
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,670
I had a really passionate night with my girlfriend recently.

346
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,760
Gosh. Seriously?

347
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,940
We were talking about smoking. Why suddenly have dirty talk?

348
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,900
Just listen. I want to hear women's perspectives.

349
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,450
Okay. Go ahead.

350
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,320
I really liked it.

351
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,010
I thought my girlfriend liked it, too, since I worked at it. But...

352
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,930
she was counting patterns on the ceiling.

353
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,650
Geez.

354
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,120
That's why you quit smoking?

355
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,560
What does that have to do with your private part?

356
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,830
Of course, they're related, man.

357
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,170
Stop laughing.

358
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,780
