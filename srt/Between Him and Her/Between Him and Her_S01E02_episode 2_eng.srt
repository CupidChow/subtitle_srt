1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,550
 Cheers.  
    

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,230
   

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,630
Have you tried contacting the "Are you sleeping" oppa?

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,030
Why are you suddenly bringing him up?

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,530
The "Are you sleeping" oppa? What? Who's that?

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,270
How come only I don't know? Fill me in!

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,840
There's someone who asks if she's sleeping all the time.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,410
Did you say someone slept with her?

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,530
Seriously. He asks if she's sleeping, I said.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,310
Why would he ask if he hasn't slept with her?

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,660
It's nothing.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,840
You should decide whether you'll talk to your boyfriend or us.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,100
Sorry. He said he'd pick me up.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,000
What? Did you make double plans?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,880
No. I really wanted to only hang out with you guys,

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,140
but he says he'd wait until we're done. What am I supposed to do?

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,860
Do you want me to say it?

18
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,580
I bet he'd do this for three months maximum.

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,500
You're wrong. It's different this time.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,600
I'll date him for a very long time.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,770
Like Seong Ok.

22
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,250
Do you want to bet?

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,720
You'll treat us if you break up in three months.

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,900
Fine. Let's bet!

25
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,670
   

26
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,830
 Are you sleeping? 

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,550
Seong Ok, she agreed to treat us.

28
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,390
Oh, really?

29
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,480
 Why won't you respond? When are we meeting? 

30
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,220
 I think I'll be free today. 

31
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,170
 I'll send you the address. Meet me there! 

32
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,300
Who is it?

33
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,020
Did Hyeon Seong apologize?

34
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,970
No.

35
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,880
You're seeing the "Are you sleeping" oppa, aren't you?

36
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,650
What? Are you leaving to sleep with someone else?

37
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,810
It's not like that. He treated me to a meal last time.

38
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm just grabbing a drink because I couldn't ignore it.

39
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,290
You're meeting a man Hyeon Seong doesn't know privately at this hour?

40
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,440
Isn't that just cheating?

41
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,850
No, it's not.

42
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,330
Are you Seong Ok?

43
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,330
What do you think is crucial in a relationship?

44
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,740
I don't know. What is it?

45
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,640
The tension that comes from the possibility that the other person might leave me.

46
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,980
You need such tension to be more grateful that they're with you, and that you treat them better.

47
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,590
Jeong Hyeon Seong needs to know, too.

48
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,460
To him, Seong Ok is a long-time girlfriend he feels comfortable with.

49
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,190
But she's someone new to other men.

50
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,430
- Is it like that? 
 - Is it?

51
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,490
It's not like that.

52
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,610
- A rabbit from the sky says? 
  - Woom-chi-chi-woom-chi-chi. Woom-chi-chi-woom-chi-chi. 

53
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,760
- Bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny. 
  - Bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny. 

54
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,930
- Bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny. 
 - Bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny.

55
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,810
Carrot...

56
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,220
 Love shot! 

57
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,170
You're so good at games, Oppa!

58
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,970
What?

59
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,090
So cute.

60
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,950
 Love shot! 

61
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,390
 Love shot! Love shot! 

62
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,590
 Love shot! Love shot! 

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,010
What's wrong with him?

64
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,320
Gosh, I lost my appetite.

65
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,700
Kim Hye Ryeong, what are you looking at?

66
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,180
Is it someone you know?

67
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,870
Pig was doing a Love Shot with some woman.

68
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,870
Come on. That makes no sense.

69
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,260
No, he was definitely there...

70
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,850
Hey, stop staring! They might bother us.

71
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,410
I don't like the vibe here. Let's leave!

72
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,450
How strange. It was definitely Pig.

73
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,180
Let's go!

74
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,480
 You're meeting a man Hyeon Seong doesn't know privately at this hour? 

75
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,900
 Isn't that just cheating? 

76
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,270
 No, it's not. 

77
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,060
 They're just getting a drink. What's the big deal? 

78
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:04,850


79
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,780
We're here.

80
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,810
 I know I'm dealing with it the wrong way, 

81
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,790
 but I can't help but feel tired. 

82
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,320
Ma'am, aren't you getting off?

83
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,700
Okay.

84
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,370
 What will happen to us now? 

85
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,260
- You came. 
 - Yes.

86
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,380
Where did you come from?

87
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,370
I was with my friends.

88
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,430
Do you know Jung Won Hyeong, by chance?

89
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,940
- Who? 
 - You know, he's the hottest influencer.

90
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,590
You don't know him?

91
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,290
Gosh, seriously.

92
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,970
Here. Look!

93
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,330
Whenever he posts something,

94
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,430
he gets at least a million views. One million.

95
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:52,920
If he just posts an outfit, the sales of the brand skyrockets that day.

96
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,640
Your design isn't bad at all, Seong Ok.

97
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,960
You need to get close to influencers like him.

98
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,120
I'll let you meet him sometime.

99
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,470
Make sure to come, okay?

100
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,350
Okay, thank you.

101
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,950
Here.

102
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,820
Cheers!

103
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,770
Jung Won Hyeong likes my design a lot.

104
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:23,330
He always asks if I have new stuff. It's almost getting annoying.

105
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,190
Hey, I can't stand being with another man.

106
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,910
 Don't worry about what Se Rim said, and just take it easy! 

107
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,660
 No one said you should date him. 

108
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,000
I know what you mean, but...

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,810
it's so uncomfortable to be with someone I don't connect with. I wish I were with Hyeon Seong.

110
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,860
 Okay. You must feel that way for a reason. 

111
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,020
 Wrap it up and call me later! 

112
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,810
- Okay. 
  - I'll hang up. 

113
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,770
   

114
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,500
 What are you up to? You dummy. 

115
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,520
 It's not like I want excitement from someone else 

116
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,900
 or want to be with another man in particular. 

117
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,000
Gosh, where did everyone go?

118
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,290
 What are you up to? You dummy. 

119
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,610
Oppa!

120
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,450
- Huh? 
 - I'm sleepy.

121
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,620
I want to go to sleep.

122
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,070
Okay, I'll get you a taxi. Let's go.

123
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,520
No.

124
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,460
With you.

125
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,680
Have some.

126
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,980
Look at you.

127
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,740
Hey, this is expensive stuff. Don't drink it like soju.

128
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,840
This is an expensive cognac.

129
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,590
Do you know why cognac glasses are short and round?

130
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,720
Because you're supposed to warm it up with body temperature.

131
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,850
It's so hot.

132
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,770
I can't believe I'm doing this because of those losers.

133
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,620
My back.

134
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,300
Oppa!

135
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,130
What are you doing?

136
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,570
Come here!

137
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,180
Huh?

138
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,210
Well...

139
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,940
Yeah...

140
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,340
 I-Is it okay to do this? 

141
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,870
I'll go to the bathroom for a second.

142
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,800
 Can we still go to Neverland? 

143
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,910
   

144
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,720
   

145
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,900
You're okay, right?

146
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,990
Looks like you haven't sobered up yet.

147
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,460
Why don't we leave in the morning together?

148
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,190
What's going on all of a sudden?

149
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,300
Are you really leaving?

150
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,260
What are you doing?

151
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,970
 Why... Why are you... 

152
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,540
What a fucking joke.

153
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,240
- Hold on. 
 - What?

154
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,480
Get lost!

155
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,070
- Are you dizzy? 
 - Get your hand off me!

156
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,510
- Are you crazy? 
 - What?

157
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,240
You can just keep walking!

158
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,250
Shit, who do you think you are?

159
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,960
   

160
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,500
   

161
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,040
 Tell me! 

162
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,250
Tell me, I said!

163
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,030
Don't you have anything to say?

164
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,240
I have nothing to say, either.

165
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,290
I don't know what I should say.

166
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,280
How did we end up this way?

167
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:22,330
♫  I'm breathing out after opening the storage  ♫

168
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,010
I think we came too far.

169
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,710
♫  After being sick for a long time  ♫

170
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,880
I'm sorry.

171
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,140
♫  When I woke up, one by one  ♫

172
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,010
No.

173
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,020
I'm sorry.

174
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,590
Sorry.

175
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,440
 Han Seong Ok! 

176
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,480
Be well.

177
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,370
♫  Bye, I'll let go of everything now  ♫

178
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:16,250
♫  Bye, you've always been so giving to me  ♫

179
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,810
    
 ♫  We're cooling down slowly  ♫

180
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:25,200
♫  I can't see you anymore because I feel guilty  ♫

181
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,960
Hey!

182
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,990
Seong Ok, we—

183
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,700
♫  Lying down the wet pillow  ♫

184
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,450
No!

185
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,500
Not yet!

186
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,150
♫  It was late at night  ♫

187
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,000
♫  After being sick for a long time  ♫

188
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,600
♫  When I woke up, everything is starting to...  ♫

189
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,250
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

190
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,490
♫  I'll let go of everything now  ♫

191
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:13,330
♫  Bye, the moments I dared to look back...  ♫

192
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,180
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

193
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,760
♫  We were hurting willingly  ♫

194
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,510
♫  I was dreaming of you then  ♫

195
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,650
♫  Let's say goodbye now  ♫

196
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,650
Nice, that's great. I can feel it. I can feel it.

197
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,670
That's right!

198
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:50,840
Push the butt out a little more this time.

199
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,190
That's right! I love it.

200
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,300
Do you want to push your breasts forward this time?

201
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,540
That's right! Feels so good.

202
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,480
Stretch your legs back more where you are now.

203
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,170
Push your breasts more. Yes. More, more, more.

204
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,040
More, more, more!

205
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,950
A little more. More! More!

206
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,040
More! More! More...

207
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,830
What? Aren't we going to shoot?

208
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Why do you need the breasts and butt for a sportswear shoot?

209
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,080
That way, women will think if they work out

210
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,750
in these clothes, they could have a figure like yours.

211
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,730
Isn't that a scam?

212
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,890
Your breasts don't get bigger by working out.

213
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,310
It's not a breast ad. I can't push them any further.

214
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,490
You're a pro. Why do you worry about that?

215
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,010
It'd be good for you, too, if your body looks good. Isn't that right?

216
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,510
What do you make the male models show off for a sportswear shoot?

217
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,880
- What? 
 - For women who work out,

218
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,700
this stuff just gets in the way. It's trash.

219
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,410
Who works out with these stuffed in?

220
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,540
So are you saying you won't do this work right now?

221
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,880
Looks like you think the photos will sell if you highlight the women's breasts and butts.

222
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,370
I think you'll naturally fall behind even if I didn't say anything. I'll stop now.

223
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,070
W-What?

224
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:06,470
   

225
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,430
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

226
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,430
What the heck? Why can't I reach her?

227
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,730
 Are you in there? 

228
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,110
Just one moment.

229
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,000
Hello, Mother!

230
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,140
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes, yes, yes.

231
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,050
What brings you here?

232
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,680
Oh, your face...

233
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,410
I fell. I'm okay.

234
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,250
I see.

235
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,170
I brought some beef bone soup.

236
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,170
I remember how much you liked it last time.

237
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,290
Seong Ok said she'd pick it up,

238
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,020
but she can't be reached. She must be busy.

239
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,420
Thank you. Come on in!

240
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,310
It's okay. I should leave.

241
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,580
Seong Ok would yell at me again.

242
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,840
- Here. 
 - Yes.

243
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,730
You just need to boil it once before you eat.

244
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,350
Do you have any side dishes left?

245
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,920
I'll bring you more if you finish them.

246
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,760
It's okay. I still have some left.

247
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,930
Thank you so much.

248
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,940
Okay, then.

249
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,230
Things will work out.

250
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,600
Don't worry so much!

251
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,240
Pardon?

252
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,070
It's normal for things to be difficult when you're young.

253
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:27,120
But you'll turn out well. Don't worry so much!

254
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,470
So eat properly and take care of yourself!

255
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,050
I'm talking too much again.

256
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,530
I'm really leaving now. Get back and carry on.

257
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,380
I feel alive now.

258
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,410
   

259
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,860
 Don't just order food all the time. Make sure to eat properly. 

260
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,770
 Okay. 

261
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,460
 Put them in the freezer if you won't eat them, okay? 

262
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,460
 Okay, okay, okay. 

263
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,370
 You're just glossing over again. 

264
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,470
 They better not have gone bad next time I'm here. 

265
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,790
 Gosh, I got it. 

266
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,630
 I just thought she was supposed to be there. 

267
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,700
 I took her for granted. 

268
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,420
 I shouldn't have just left her there. 

269
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,310
 I should've taken better care of her. 

270
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,320
 Did we really break up? 

271
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,280
 I'm not so sure yet. 

272
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,020
You want to take a half-day off?

273
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,650
Yes.

274
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,720
What's the reason?

275
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,760
It's personal.

276
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,000
You don't want me to ask, right?

277
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,660
Well, I'm not feeling so well.

278
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,760
But you'll be completely cured once you leave the office, right?

279
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,320
Well, if I can't today—

280
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,940
Y-Yes. Yes, you can.

281
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,690
Personal reason?

282
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,810
Okay.

283
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,060
Thank you.

284
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,630
   

285
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,350
Why did you go there? I said I'll pick it up.

286
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,490
 I went because you didn't come. 

287
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,370
Don't just go there from now on, okay?

288
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,100
 Listen to you. Is this how you talk to your mom? 

289
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,380
Mom!

290
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,650
 Gosh, okay. I won't go, then. 

291
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,360
It's not easy to carry the heavy stuff there, either.

292
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,160
 I did it for you. I didn't do it for myself. 

293
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,510
Okay, okay. I'm sorry for being annoyed, but you could've let me know in advance.

294
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,620
I just went because you didn't answer your phone in time.

295
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,330
Does Hyeon Seong feel uncomfortable with me going there?

296
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,030
Mom!

297
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,610
You know he's not like that.

298
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,960
 Isn't it... 

299
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,210
because the corporate deal or whatever didn't work out, right?

300
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,640
By chance, did you tell Hyeon Seong—

301
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,630
 Gosh, come on. 

302
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:39,270
Why would I bring that up? I know how to read the air, too.

303
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,010
How about you?

304
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,100
 Are you okay? 

305
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,210
Why do you ask?

306
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,250
What do you mean, why?

307
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,800
You must've looked forward to it, too.

308
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,400
No. Hyeon Seong is having a harder time than I am.

309
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,590
You should eat the beef bone soup with him, too.

310
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,230
 You'll damage your health if you keep skipping meals because you're busy. 

311
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,350
 I know how tiring your work is. You got it? 

312
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,340
I got it.

313
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,660
Thank you, Mom!

314
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,640
 - Daebak! 
 - Hey, our first... 

315
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,980
 Hey, did we just receive an order? 

316
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,090
 They bought a T-shirt. 

317
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,410
 Hey, we did receive an order! 

318
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,940
 They bought the bracelet, too! 

319
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,710
 Hey, hey, hey. This is our first order. 

320
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,900
 Seriously. Look! 

321
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,210
 This is so crazy. 

322
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,130
 It's black this time. 

323
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,610
 This and... 

324
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,180
 - This one? 
 - The blue one. 

325
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,190
 Put the sticker in there! 

326
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,150
 Did you know love has an expiration date too? 

327
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,050
 Huh? What do you mean? 

328
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,960
 They experimented with couples who just started dating. 

329
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,280
 When they were first interviewed, they didn't look at the camera. 

330
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,210
 They used to only look at each other, holding hands. 

331
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,870
 But as time passed, they only looked at the camera without looking at each other. 

332
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,650
 Come on. I won't be like that. 

333
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,240
 Listen. So... 

334
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,570
 they had a brain scan when they first started being interviewed. 

335
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,290
 At first, dopamine was actively released in their left brains. 

336
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,170
 But after 100 days, the dopamine level went down 

337
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:13,630
 and the hormones that control logical thinking started being created. 

338
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:19,190
 According to science, love lasts for 100 days to three years. 

339
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:23,080
 They say old couples stay together because of loyalty, not love. 

340
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,120
 Will we end up like that, too? 

341
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,790
 No. 

342
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,820
 As for me... Look! 

343
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,980
 I can control both my left brain and right brain. 

344
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,180
 - What are you talking about? 
 - I'm serious. 

345
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,600
 Just believe me! 

346
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,730
 I want to. 

347
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,640
 I'm serious. Just believe me! 

348
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,740
 - Promise? 
 - Promise. 

349
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,620
 Then, should we send our child to an English-speaking kindergarten? 

350
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,680
 Sounds good. 

351
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,520
 We'll get a green sofa, 

352
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,200
 and we'll get an extendable dining table. 

353
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,150
 I love it. 

354
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,650
 Would black be better than green? 

355
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,110
 I like anything you like. 

356
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,790
 On that note, do you want to do it again? 

357
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,230
 What? You were thinking about that without listening to me, huh? 

358
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,930
 No. I listened to everything. 

359
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,450
 Let's do it again! Please? 

360
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,760
 I don't want to. I won't. 

361
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,310
 What? Hey! 

362
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,310
 - Don't come! 
 - What? What is it? 

363
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,380
 Come on... 

364
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:36,440
 Why were we so confident back then? 

365
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,510
 What were we so confident about that we made so many promises? 

366
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:45,090
 It wasn't something we could keep, anyway. 

367
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,730
   

368
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,780
What?

369
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,580
I knew you'd be here.

370
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,840
Why won't you answer your phone?

371
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,290
Did you get home safely last night?

372
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:51,080
What's wrong? Did something happen?

373
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,610
Hey...

374
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,410
Gosh, it's hot!

375
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,430
 Gosh, you klutz. Let me see. 

376
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,170
 Your face. What happened? 

377
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,530
- Huh? 
  - What will you do without me? 

378
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:40,080
 Hey, hey! Stop hugging, seriously! 

379
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,360
 I don't want to. We'll never stop hugging. 

380
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,700
 I'll take it now. One, two, three! 

381
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,520
 - Did you push it? 
 - Yes, I did. 

382
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,760
 Let's go, let's go, let's go. Hurry! 

383
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,840
 Is it ready? Is it? 

384
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,400
♫  The stars shining brightly in the dark of the night  ♫

385
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,500
 What are you looking at? 

386
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,550
 Don't look at that and look at me! 

387
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,130
 You're too close! 

388
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,780
 No, it's okay because this is a wide lens. 

389
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,150
 Wow, the weather is amazing! 

390
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,190
 We're having a school uniform date. 

391
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,130
 We're at Neverland today. 

392
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,890
 Okay. It's happening soon. 

393
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:21,110
♫  Every day  ♫

394
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,570
♫  Remember when the stars were shining?  ♫

395
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:32,910
♫  Every time, every day  ♫

396
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,380
   

397
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,430
 Okay. 

398
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,170
 Let's see... 

399
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,000
   

400
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,300
   

401
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,160
   

402
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,150
   

403
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,560
 I can only work weekdays for the next few days. 

404
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,820
   

405
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:17,230
91,500 won  (~ $70) per day. 183,000... 
     

406
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,280
Welcome!

407
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,000
Huh?

408
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,100
What are you doing here?

409
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,950
What? What is it?

410
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,200
Come here!

411
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,570
- What the— 
 - Hold still!

412
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,560
It was definitely you.

413
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,110
Weren't you at the Romance Bar?

414
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,500
Ro... Romance, my foot!

415
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,860
I can't... I can't have that in my life.

416
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,990
No, it had to be you.

417
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:01,270
Not everyone has the fat from alcohol on their faces.

418
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,030
Do you want to die?

419
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,500
Did you come to tell me that?

420
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,400
No, I wanted to get a drink. You're almost done with work, right?

421
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,210
Don't you have to work at the kindergarten?

422
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,780
Did you get fired by chance?

423
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,380
What kind of kindergarten teacher drinks every day?

424
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,240
We're on vacation!

425
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,890
- I'm not going to drink. 
 - Why not?

426
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,720
I'm trying to lose fat from alcohol, okay?

427
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,060
You lose fat from alcohol with alcohol.

428
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,680
I'll make you a diet cocktail, okay?

429
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,700
- Diet cocktail? 
 - Yes.

430
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,140
- Deal! 
 - Deal! I'll be waiting.

431
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,230
It's your treat.

432
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,690
Weren't you supposed to work here?

433
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,260
I noticed your mother earlier.

434
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,910
It's just temporary since we can't get a part-timer.

435
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:12,170
Why don't kids get part-time jobs these days? They raised the hourly wage, too.

436
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,290
Hey, why are you drinking so fast?

437
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:21,250
I'm worried about something I've never worried about before.

438
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,890
What?

439
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,350
Did you have a fight with Seong Ok?

440
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,900
I wish we had a fight.

441
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,000
You didn't even fight. What's the issue?

442
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,860
I know.

443
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,210
Hey! Have some snacks while drinking.

444
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,600
- Seong Ok likes shrimp. 
 - Hey!

445
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,180
I'm sorry. I-It came out of nowhere.

446
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,640
And she doesn't like shrimp, okay?

447
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,690
She doesn't eat it because she doesn't like peeling it, okay?

448
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,740
Yes. You must know better.

449
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,850
Geez, seriously. Why bring her up when I'm already depressed?

450
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,810
 - Seong Ok! 
 - Yes? 

451
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,680
 You furl your eyebrows when you're focused. 

452
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,810
 That's really sexy. 

453
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,610
 I'm busy. 

454
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,000
 It's sexy, I said. 

455
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,920
 I heard you. 

456
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,670
 Hold on. 

457
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,250
 I need to photograph stuff like this. 

458
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,290
You came.

459
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,970
I told her we're here.

460
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,710
- What is it? 
 - Are you hurting?

461
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,350
Can't you tell?

462
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,490
You coward!

463
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,200
What?

464
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,510
I knew you were a coward.

465
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,040
You don't care about others hurting, but you want to avoid getting hurt.

466
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,470
Hey, don't be like that. He's stressed out, too—

467
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:38,610
You've been delaying breaking up to avoid being a son of a bitch, and this happened.

468
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,490
How dare you pretend to be hurting?

469
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,590
Hey, what do you know—

470
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,820
Everyone knows you've been neglecting Seong Ok.

471
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,560
What am I supposed to do about it?

472
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,180
Stop pretending to be hurting!

473
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,790
Gosh, seriously...

474
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,330
You'd better behave, too.

475
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
O-Okay.

476
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,830
I'm leaving.

477
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,990
Where are you going?

478
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,130
You'd better behave, too.

479
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,260
What? What do you mean?

480
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,650
What was that?

481
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,450
What's wrong with her?

482
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,120
What's wrong with him now?

483
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,760
He said he didn't fight with Seong Ok.

484
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,950
But it seems that way, right?

485
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:31,020
- What are you talking about? 
 - I don't know, either.

486
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,020
What? Are you picking up?

487
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,500
Hey!

488
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,680
Give me a glass, too!

489
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,970
Did you start working?

490
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,500
Yes, I ran out of the unemployment benefits.

491
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,720
I need to work to meet women.

492
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,000
Is meeting women the only goal in your life?

493
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,090
Hey, what else do you need?

494
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,300
What happened with those girls last night?

495
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,540
What? Nothing happened.

496
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,740
Gosh, you got dumped.

497
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:02,290
What's the point of setting you up? You guys don't even try.

498
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,340
Seriously, what's the deal?

499
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,500
Will you break up with her or something?

500
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,760
What? Seriously?

501
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,650
No way! That can't be.

502
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,640
Don't give this to me, even if I ask for it.

503
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,670
I'm worried I'd call Seong Ok.

504
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,950
But...

505
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,560
why can't he call Seong Ok?

506
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,490
I guess it's a serious situation.

507
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,440
Can't you call if things are serious?

508
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,610
Gosh, you forever single, Hyeong Seop.

509
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:02,010
Calling after getting drunk is the worst.

510
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,180

such a sad song?

553
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:10,180
Seong Ok sang this while crying when Hyeon Seong was leaving for the military.

554
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:20,230
Hey, give me my phone!

555
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,970
Gosh, no! Geez!

556
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,040
Give it to me, I said!

557
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,530
Don't give it to him! I'm sure he'll say nonsense.

558
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,190
- Okay. 
 - Give it to me now!

559
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,950
What are you doing? I told you to give me my phone!

560
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:33,140
- Delete Seong Ok's number! 
 - What do you mean, delete? Give it to me! Hey, hey!

561
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,130
- Hey! 
 - I need to scan his face. His face!

562
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,820
- My face? My face? 
 - Give me your face!

563
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,670
- Hey! Shit! 
 - It worked!

564
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,580
You'd better not delete it!

565
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,950
You'd better not! I'll kill you.

566
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,550
- Deleted! 
 - Okay!

567
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,030
Give it to me, I said!

568
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,020
   

569
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:53,200
Gosh, seriously.

570
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,150
38,000 won  (~ $29) . How many hours of work is that?

571
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,940
Geez. Seriously...

572
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,950
You live so desperately.

573
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,370
Do you really want to die?

574
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:09,180
Whose fault is it that I missed the last bus?

575
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,580
Hey, why don't we do this instead?

576
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,410
Let's get one taxi! You can drop me off in the middle and go to your place.

577
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,930
That'd be better than getting two.

578
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:25,230
Do you think it's that much of a waste?

579
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:26,560
Of course.

580
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,330
How disappointing.

581
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,870
Huh?

582
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:30,950
What do you mean?

583
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:35,410
You mean spending money with me is a waste to you.

584
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:40,500
Hey, I didn't mean it like that.

585
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,390
I have to work more if I spend more than I planned.

586
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:47,650
And I need to set more time aside, you know...

587
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,590
What? What is it? What?

588
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:53,040
You don't know, do you?

589
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,780
Know what?

590
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,790
I...

591
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,170
used to like you.

592
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,690
What?

593
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,850
When I first met you,

594
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,510
I thought you were kind of cool.

595
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:19,040
Hey, w-what are you talking about right now?

596
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,180
Pig!

597
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,410
I said I used to like you.

598
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,460
Gosh, seriously.

599
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,480
Kim Hye Ryeong! Get up!

600
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,670
Get up, I said!

601
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,760
You don't wake up once you fall asleep! Geez...

602
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,650
   

603
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,500
One room.

604
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,700
Put it on this card!

605
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,920
- One payment, right? 
 - Yes.

606
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,260
   

607
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:00,660
   

608
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,460
   

609
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,880
Geez!

610
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,840
Gosh.

611
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:08,190
   

612
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,900
Hello?

613
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,480
Hey, Han Seong Ok!

614
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,890
Isn't this hard for you?

615
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,860
I miss you.

616
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,550
I miss you, I said.

617
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,500
Also, aren't you taking this too far?

618
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,880
We've been together forever. How can we break up?

619
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,800
Seriously.

620
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,790
I'm hurting.

621
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:02,990
I'm hurting right now. Han Seong Ok!

622
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:06,420
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

623
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,120
 After the beep, there will be a charge.

 I... used to like you. 

630
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,830
 She used to like me? 

631
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:07,680
 She's out of her mind. Totally out of her mind. 

632
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,040
 They look heavy. Should I carry them for you? 

633
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,660
 Geez. 

634
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,910
 He's just a kid, and he's already hitting on women. 

635
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:17,970
 This bastard. I'm sure his life sucks in real life. 

636
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:20,490
 Who the hell is this loser? 

637
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,420
 Kwon Hyeop! 

638
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,250
 What are you doing? Get in! 

639
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,530
 You didn't have to do all this. 

640
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,880
 You know there aren't many men like me, right? 

641
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,900
 I'm not in the situation to make a decision right now. 

642
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,980
 I'll be waiting. 

643
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:42,560
 How long will you guys do this? 

644
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,110
 Either break up or keep seeing each other. 

645
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:46,870
 Can we... 

646
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:47,980
 talk for a moment? 

647
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,770
 It's not what you think. 

648
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,720
