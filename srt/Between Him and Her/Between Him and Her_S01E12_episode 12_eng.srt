1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,290
   

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,870


3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,600
   

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,800
Hey, Mom.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,470
 When are you coming home? How about dinner? 

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,840
Well, I'm not done with work yet.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,930
 Still? When will you be done? 

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,510
Well, I'm not sure.

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,310
 Come home soon so we could eat. 

10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,240
Okay.

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,970
Still waiting for someone?

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,150
Why do you keep staring?

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,250
No, I...

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,930
wasn't staring.

15
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,140
Are you getting in?

16
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,260
Ma'am.

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,410
Yes.

18
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,890
 Why am I so nervous? 

19
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,100
 I'm just going there to celebrate H2. 

20
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,290
Hey, gather around.

21
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,730
Come on and gather around.

22
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,770
Why bother taking a picture?

23
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,530
Come on. I need to send it to my girlfriend.

24
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,910
- Babe, let's take a photo. Come on. 
 - Okay.

25
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,940
One, two, three.

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,750
Okay, it turned out well.

27
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,390
Yes, yes. I'll check and call you back. Okay.

28
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,680
Hyeon Seong, I think you should thank the guests or something.

29
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,680
I'll do it a little later.

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,310
You can't delay much longer.

31
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,120
Okay.

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,860
Hurry.

33
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,710
You're so cool, Jeong Hyeon Seong!

34
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,540
Honey...

35
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,300
Was that no good? Not yet?

36
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,870
Thank you so much for making time to come here.

37
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,420
I'm Jeong Hyeon Seong, the CEO of H2.

38
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,150
H2 means "Hip to Human."

39
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,640
It means we aspire to a trendiness that's devoted to humanity.

40
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,270
As a native street fashion brand based in Seoul,

41
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,070
H2 will expand and enter the global market as well.

42
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,780
And we'll focus more on the jewelry line in addition to the fashion line.

43
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,670
Also...

44
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,980
 She's here. 

45
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,240
To be honest,

46
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,960
there's another hidden meaning to the name, H2.

47
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,480
H comes from the name of the two people who started H2.

48
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,040
It means two Hs.

49
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,590
The logo of H2 conveys that meaning, too.

50
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:23,430
In the Korean street fashion market that's dominated by foreign brands, H2 will...

51
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,860
 Do you have to use the word "native"? 

52
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,870
 - How about— 
 - Hold on, hold on. 

53
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,310
compete with its unique brand identity.

54
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,280
And to preserve the original H2,

55
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,290
we'll bring back the jewelry line, which was there initially, and strengthen our...

56
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,000
original concept, "Fashion and jewelry."

57
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,430
I hope you support H2's future. Thank you.

58
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,470
You're so cool, Jeong Hyeon Seong!

59
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,100
So cool!

60
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,150
- You made it. 
 - Yes.

61
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,230
I'll just go say hello. That's okay, right?

62
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,810
- Yes. 
 - We'll be right back.

63
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,340
Let me introduce her to you.

64
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,690
- I came since I finished work earlier than expected. 
 - I see.

65
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,150
Hey, you made it.

66
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,700
- Long time no see. 
 - I know.

67
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,600
Madam Ok.

68
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,310
- Have you been well? 
 - Have you?

69
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,790
Of course.

70
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,950
Here. She's my girlfriend.

71
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,180
Hello.

72
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,200
Hello.

73
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,270
Oh Fatty, you look happy.

74
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,560
Of course, I'm happy.

75
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,410
It's nice to hear you call me "Oh Fatty," too.

76
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,740
Hey, Seong Ok.

77
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,880
You've been well, right?

78
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,160
Yes, I have. How about you?

79
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,870
I'm the same as usual, you know.

80
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,900
- It's nice to see you. 
 - Hey.

81
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,470
What took you so long?

82
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,790
I'm sorry, the chef suddenly quit. It was a total disaster. Seriously.

83
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,410
- Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
 - Hey.

84
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,920
Will you make her stand here like this?

85
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,310
Sorry, did you have dinner? Let's go, let's go.

86
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,800
Come on, you don't get to join her.

87
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,770
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot because it felt so natural. Yeah...

88
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,370
Then, why don't we drink together later?

89
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,620
- Let's. Yes, yes. 
 - Deal.

90
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,780
- Let's go. 
 - See you.

91
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,380
- See you later. 
 - See you.

92
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,650
See you later.

93
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,110
- Where's our table? 
 - Come here. Come here.

94
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,530
- Hey, can't you be more punctual? 
 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

95
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

96
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,700
- I'll sit here. 
 - Come on, that's my seat.

97
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,470
You made it.

99
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,150
I'll have a glass of ice water here. Yes.

100
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,320
Hyeon Seong, by the way, did you...

101
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,370
decide to run H2 with Seong Ok?

102
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,900
 I thought I had moved on, 

103
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,910
 but now that I see her, 

104
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:22,150
 her presence reflected in my eyes brings me pain once again. 

105
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,080
Did you decide to join him?

106
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,690
- No. 
 - Right?

107
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,180
But you still decided to show up.

108
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,030
   

109
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,430
This is great.

110
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,950
Do you mean H2 or Jeong Hyeon Seong?

111
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,320
Both?

112
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,790
Right, your designs for this season were crazy.

113
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,040
Is it already sold out?

114
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,950
Yes, I suppose it started by word of mouth. It sold out.

115
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,940
I'm totally shocked myself.

116
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,800
I didn't get to buy anything.

117
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,450
- I'll set yours aside next time. 
 - Really?

118
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,690
- I'll gratefully accept it. 
 - My pleasure.

119
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,370
- Well, Seong— 
 - CEO Jeong.

120
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,800
Over here.

121
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,550
Yes.

122
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,770
You need to drink with me.

123
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,230
Wait...

124
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,950
- I'll stop by the restroom real quick. 
 - Okay.

125
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,980
You need to take care of an emergency. Go ahead.

126
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,630
Okay.

127
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,990
- I'll make a phone call. 
 - Okay.

128
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,700
You came.

129
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,320
Yes.

130
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,470
You got a haircut.

131
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,170
Yes.

132
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,920
It suits you.

133
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,150
I'll go to the restroom.

134
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,800
Okay.

135
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,770
S-Seong Ok.

136
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,240
- Have a glass. 
 - Have some.

137
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,880
- Oh, okay. 
 - All right.

138
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,140
Cheers.

139
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,990
Congratulations.

140
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,520
Nice.

141
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,940
Have some.

142
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,880
It's tasty. Eat.

143
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,930
Thank you.

144
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:51,270
CEO Jeong, I swear I knew this would happen. You know, right?

145
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,450
Let's get a good thing going.

146
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,900
- Okay. 
 - Congratulations, Hyeong.

147
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,150
You know I mean it, right?

148
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,110
Hyeong? You need to call him "CEO."

149
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,490
Oh, okay. We'll get going, Hyeong.

150
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,580
I mean, CEO Jeong. Fighting.

151
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,040
Let's go.

152
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,080
- How nice! 
 - See you.

153
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,990
Jeong Hyeon Seong.

154
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,900
Geez...

155
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,290
- What will you do? 
 - What?

156
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,760
We finally got together. Let's have another round.

157
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,140
Let's do that.

158
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,210
It's on me since I was late.

159
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,550
You heard that, right? He'll pay for the second round. You will, right?

160
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,160
- I will. 
 - He's paying.

161
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,810
Where are we going?

162
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,900
Doesn't Eun Jeong know this neighborhood well?

163
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,970
Eun Jeong, we're having a second round. Join us.

164
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,920
You know this area well. Take us to a good place and drink more.

165
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,050
Hey, read the room a bit.

166
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,050
Are you okay with that?

167
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,370
Hyeon Seong is here, too.

168
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,180
What do we do? Looks like she'll join us.

169
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,990
Are you okay?

170
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,330
- I'm okay. 
 - I'm okay.

171
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,150
   

172
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,270
Wow. It feels so awkward to finally get together.

173
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,430
I know.

174
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,340
It's kind of an awkward picture, all right.

175
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,900
Are you two running H2 together now, then?

176
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,310
Seong Ok is just here to congratulate him. Right, Seong Ok?

177
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,120
I'm on board.

178
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,470
I'm on board.

179
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,420
Do you remember?

180
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,080
I'm talking about H2's opening event.

181
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,560
You invited all of us to the opening event

182
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,670
and all you got was a bowl of jjajangmyeon each.

183
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,660
I really wanted to eat something else.

184
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,120
Why are you bringing up jjajangmyeon now?

185
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,100
You know, for me...

186
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,950
I can't forget the taste of that jjajangmyeon.

187
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,720
Why? Was it a famous place? No.

188
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,020
Because I was there to celebrate the future of my dearest friends, Hyeon Seong and Seong Ok.

189
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,910
And I think today...

190
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,080
is the beginning of that future.

191
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,120
Seong Ok, you know...

192
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,180
I'm not telling you to get back together with Hyeon Seong and make it work.

193
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,660
Just think. What would H2 be without you?

194
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,400
- Oh Fatty. 
 - Yes.

195
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,200
- Sit down. 
 - Okay.

196
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,470
I'm on board, too.

197
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,780
- That's right. 
 - I mean...

198
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,720
it'd be nice if they worked together.

199
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,020
Sorry. I only came to congratulate him today.

200
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,650
Where are you going?

201
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,920
I'll go to the restroom real quick.

202
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,480
Hey, why... Why...

203
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,150
Why?

204
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,280
Can't you just work together?

205
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,470
I want to eat your ramen again.

206
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,510
Just work together. Please. Work together.

207
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,930
Please work together, please!

208
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,000
Hey, hey, hey. You can't just insist like that.

209
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,420
Enough is enough.

210
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,170
Let's be honest.

211
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,020
You can't work together after you break up?

212
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:20,110
Don't you know? Seong Ok worked so hard for H2.

213
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,270
Hey, who wants ice cream?

214
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,420
Why are you bringing up ice cream now?

215
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,890
Forget it if you don't want it.

216
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,440
Do you want ice cream, babe?

217
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,120
- Sounds good. 
 - Should we go, then? Let's go.

218
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,260
- Let's go. 
 - I'll come, too.

219
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,570
- Hey, Seop. 
 - Yeah?

220
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,610
You want ice cream, too.

221
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,210
Oh, okay.

222
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,400
What will you get?

223
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:59,150
Let's get your favorite chocolate ice cream. Chocolate...

224
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,140
 Why does everything happen too late? 

225
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,140
- Where's everyone? 
 - Well...

226
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,110
They went to a convenience store.

227
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,010
Would you like some, too?

228
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,810
I'll stick with what I've been drinking.

229
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,310
- What? 
 - Well...

230
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,730
It's funny how you always stutter whenever you present.

231
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,800
You can't get so nervous like that.

232
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,940
Hey, people don't change that much.

233
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,600
Oh, did you see Oh Fatty? Isn't it funny?

234
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,350
Yes. He looked happy.

235
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,190
They say the late bloomers are more intense.

236
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,960
It's so annoying how he keeps saying, "Babe, babe."

237
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,840
You do that when you just start dating.

238
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,060
Were we like that, too?

239
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,770
We were.

240
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,500
Hey, let's get going now.

241
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,700
They probably got to talk enough.

242
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,330
Hold on, Eun Jeong.

243
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,140
Let's not go.

244
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,480
Let's just have them keep talking tonight.

245
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,360
They probably...

246
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,830
need more time to sort things out.

247
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,250
Let's not go, then.

248
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,080
Time flies, huh?

249
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,660
We're almost thirty now.

250
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,210
I know.

251
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,810
We met when we were 23, and we're almost 30 already.

252
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,960
What are we going to do?

253
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,480
Thank you...

254
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,700
for coming.

255
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:12,700
I didn't think you'd come when I sent the invitation.

256
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,370
Do you have a boyfriend?

257
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,510
Not yet?

258
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,430
Not yet.

259
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,110
I'm not interested.

260
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,770
You know...

261
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,560
Could we just...

262
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,860
run H2 together?

263
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,430
- What? 
 - I'm not trying to get you back.

264
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,920
It's because I need you.

265
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,920
We started H2 Jewelry together in the beginning, too.

266
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:02,920
- No, I— 
 - Do you remember when we first started H2?

267
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,620
Deciding on our name...

268
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,550
logo design, and everything took forever.

269
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:14,450
We said we have to decide on a good one since we'll be using them for a long time.

270
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,900
We did.

271
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,430
And when I came up with the name H2,

272
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,990
I created a PPT and presented it in front of you in the lecture room.

273
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,980
 A street fashion brand that represents Korea. 

274
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,910
 H as in Han Seong Ok. 

275
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,210
 And H, as in Hyeon Seong. 

276
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,880
 It means it's a brand created by the two of us. 

277
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,640
I was nervous that you might not like it.

278
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,470
I was relieved that you liked it.

279
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,100
When we consider that, we're more in sync than we seem, aren't we?

280
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,480
Also, when H2 received its first order,

281
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,240
we butted our foreheads while hugging excitedly, remember?

282
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,970
 This is our first order! 

283
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,530
 Seriously. Look. 

284
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:19,370
We thought we'd conquer the world with H2, then.

285
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,730
Why...

286
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,060
Why do you keep bringing up stuff like that...

287
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,180
at this point?

288
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,050
Well...

289
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,220
I just thought of them as fond memories.

290
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,300
I'm sorry. If you feel uncomfortable—

291
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,240
I do.

292
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,270
Honestly speaking.

293
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,200
Those are not fond memories.

294
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,240
I don't want to remember.

295
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,030
Do you...

296
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,270
Do you think it's easy for me to talk about this?

297
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,050
I know.

298
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,430
It's not easy.

299
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,360
I'd also like to reminisce about the old days while laughing with you.

300
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,800
But how could I?

301
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:25,770
Whether it's good or bad, you exist in all the memories I have.

302
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,490
Do you think it's easy for me to forget someone I was with for seven years?

303
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,140
I thought I had forgotten everything. Why did you have to remind me?

304
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,330
- Where are you going? 
 - I'm going home.

305
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,180
No.

306
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,480
You're too drunk now. And...

307
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,350
it's dangerous to go alone.

308
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,660
Where are you going?

309
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,630
I no longer...

310
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,490
want to see you leaving.

311
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,290
Just today.

312
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,640
Just today, Seong Ok.

313
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,560
Please.

314
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,940
 I'll go. 

315
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,800
 I'm sorry. 

316
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,870
 I did it. I cheated. 

317
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,860
 Seong Ok, we... 

318
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,200
 Yes. 

319
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,580
♫  I feel like I'm in love  ♫

320
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,320
♫  I know it looks weird, but walk on the road singing ooh-ooh-ooh  ♫

321
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,430
 I'm just asking you to think about me at least once. 

322
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,580
 What more am I supposed to do? Shit. Seriously. 

323
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:11,600
♫  When you're in my arms  ♫ 
 ♫  It's better we are singing ooh-ooh-ooh  ♫

324
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:17,080
 I don't mind anything as long as you're happy. 

325
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,760
♫  From the sun to midnight moon  ♫

326
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,190
♫  When I'm with you  ♫

327
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,120
 - I love you. 
 - I love you more. 

328
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,810
♫  Anything looks great  ♫

329
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:33,630
♫  From the sun to midnight moon  ♫

330
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,870
 Go out with me. 

331
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,320
This doesn't feel right.

332
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,960
 What did I expect? 

333
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,510
 It's too late now. 

334
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,750
 What did I want to recover? 

335
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,100
I'm sorry.

336
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,860
You should stop...

337
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,030
saying you're sorry.

338
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,180
I'll stop, too.

339
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,730
Okay.

340
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,970
Seong Ok.

341
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,600
What if...

342
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,320
we didn't run into...

343
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,810
each other there that day,

344
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,150
what would we be like now?

345
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,630
Never mind.

346
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,850
I shouldn't have asked that.

347
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,730
There is no such a thing as...

348
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,210
"what if."

349
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,990
 Yes. 

350
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,860
 There's not such a thing as... 

351
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,230
 "what if." 

352
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,240
Shall we go now?

353
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,860
All right.

354
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,070
Han Seong Ok.

355
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,140
Good work.

356
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,380
You, too.

357
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,280
Thank you.

358
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,770
 Since we loved each other for long, we needed more time to break up. 

359
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:56,080
 Now that I look back, I think Seong Ok has been 

360
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,610
 by my side until I accepted our breakup. 

361
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,290
 Thank you, Han Seong Ok. 

362
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,490
So you two are dating?

363
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,730
- Gross. 
 - It just happened so.

364
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,710
But why are you telling us now?

365
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:31,470
It's because we knew you'd be like this.

366
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,800
Why are you so serious?

367
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,850
- Come on. Let's take photos. 
 - Shall we?

368
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,010
Put that away.

369
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,380
How will the four of us hang out now?

370
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,750
What do you mean?

371
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,810
We just need to hang out l-like we used to.

372
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,010
Don't think too much. Not much has changed, I'm sure.

373
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,950
Not much has changed?

374
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,940
You'll start kissing and stuff like that now.

375
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,630
Wow, I bloody hate it. Seriously.

376
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,830
Is that possible?

377
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,020
It's the same as me kissing Jjang Ji, for example.

378
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,720
Hey! How dare you.

379
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,880
I mean...

380
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,020
Hey, just congratulate us.

381
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,790
Yes, we...

382
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,310
swear we'll be happy together.

383
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,140
It's a bit hard to accept yet,

384
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,590
but okay. Congratulations.

385
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,470
You heard that, right, babe? She said, "Congratulations."

386
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,370
- Thank you. 
 - H-Hold on.

387
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,600
Did I just hear...

388
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,310
correctly just now?

389
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:34,310
Him saying, "Babe"?

390
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,150
I take it back. I'm against this relationship.

391
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,680
It's too gross. I can't handle it.

392
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,660
Babe, Jjang Ji is jealous of us.

393
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,290
I know. She's weird.

394
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:45,180
Of course, I call her "babe." Should I call her "baby"?

395
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,110
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

396
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,040
This couple is being canceled.

397
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,180
Okay. I'll treat you to three rounds today.

398
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,080
- Do you accept? 
 - I accept.

399
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,610
- Do you accept? 
 - I accept.

400
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,550
Hurry up and say you accept us as the official couple.

401
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,500
One, two, three.

402
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,260
We accept you as the...

403
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,910
- official couple. 
 - official couple.

404
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,240
Thank you.

405
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,350
I'm happy.

406
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,040
Thank you.

407
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,090
 Some love comes to fruition after sharing a long time together. 

408
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,440
   

409
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,670
 I'll be there soon. 

410
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,660
 Take your time. 

411
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,010
   

412
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,740
   

413
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,130
What are you looking at?

414
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,840
You came.

415
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,910
What? Did you run?

416
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,070
Yes. I wanted to see you quickly.

417
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,330
You shouldn't have run like that.

418
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,080
I found a good place nearby. Shall we go?

419
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,830
Let's go.

420
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,660
Hold on.

421
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,170
Huh? What was that?

422
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,850
Today is our 100th day together.

423
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:13,960
Let's take a photo every hour, 24 in total, to celebrate it.

424
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,570
We're going to a restaurant, so we'll take one there.

425
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,910
And remember the café I said was good?

426
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,560
It's right nearby. So we'll go there and...

427
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,200
Yu Na.

428
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,430
Huh?

429
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,220
What?

430
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,910
Thank you.

431
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:38,240
It's not that big of a deal to be so touched.

432
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,510
It is.

433
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:55,790
 And some find love when they finally 

434
00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:00,880
 can let go of their love from the past. 

435
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,900
Shall we?

436
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,570
Yes.

437
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,710
I loved your Jewelry A campaign.

438
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,040
- Really? 
 - Yes, yes.

439
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,740
So we're thinking of doing something similar. Would you be up for it?

440
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,790
I'd love that.

441
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,370
You'll be keeping the same hair length, right?

442
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,760
I'm planning to. What do you think?

443
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,900
Sounds great.

444
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,960
You can't run. You don't want to fall.

445
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,320
 You have to push the ball with the big toe 

446
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,940
 and the front of your foot to spin it. 

447
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:53,290
 The key is to go with the flow rather than kicking with force. 

448
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,510
Eun Jeong. Eun Jeong, where are you going?

449
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,440
Jun Su Seonbae?

450
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,430
Hey, Eun Jeong.

451
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,630
Say hello.

452
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,210
Hello.

453
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,100
Hi.

454
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:55,950
 Some realize the first love is most beautiful when you keep it as a memory. 

455
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,990
Your mother owns a dim sum chain

456
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,220
and you're running one currently on your own.

457
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,700
And the profile says you're 176 cm tall.

458
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,470
Is this correct?

459
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,320
You can't lie to me.

460
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:16,260
Well, including the insoles... It's not exactly a lie.

461
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,400
Let's fix the height.

462
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,640
   

463
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,880
Looks aren't everything in this world.

464
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,900
Let's try to be confident, okay?

465
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,630
- Pardon? 
 - After careful consideration,

466
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:36,370
we found a woman who fits your conditions perfectly.

467
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,660
   

468
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,180
Sally?

469
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:53,200
 And some think of the repeated coincidence as fate and get excited. 

470
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,020
This is a standard contract for Ok Jewelry's launch.

471
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,630
Please read through and sign.

472
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,410
Okay.

473
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:11,560
 And we're trying to move forward by putting the previous relationship in the past. 

474
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,210
   

475
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,350
   

476
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:32,730
 When time passes, we might start a new relationship 

477
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,540
 with someone else, right? 

478
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,860
 Even so, I won't be able to... 

479
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,300
 forget Seong Ok's warmth and 

480
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,900
 the sound of her breath when she held me that day. 

481
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:32,280
 By sharing happiness and bringing each other back on track, 

482
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:38,220
 we grew together little by little and loved each other unconditionally. 

483
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,780
 Even though I try to forget you, 

484
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:45,840
 I'm sure I'll think of you at times. 

485
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:07,280
 Even if enough time passes for all the memories to get scattered, 

486
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:13,230
 I hope you remember me sometimes. 

487
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,750
 I'll remember those fond memories. 

488

final credits

489
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:45,910
final credits

490
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:52,920
final credits

491
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,920
final credits

492
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,880
final credits

493
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,890
   

494
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:32,990


495
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,370
- Hey, Jjeong. 
  - Hey, Ok. 

496
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,070
 I came to the address you sent, but I can't find it. 

497
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,600
Take a turn by the convenience store into the alley.

498
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,930
 I'm sorry, Ok. We'll be right there. Congrats. 

499
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,750
 Congratulations. 

500
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,350
Thank you.

501
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,700
 Looks like it's that way. 

502
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,240
 I know I said it's that way. 

503
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,190
Is everyone coming with you?

504
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:56,160
 Yes, all the losers are here. 

505
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,450
 We'll be there soon. Wait just a moment. 

506
00:45:58,450 --> 00:45:59,280
Okay.

507
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,940
 How many times has it been, Hyeong Seop? Seriously. 

508
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,210
We should've just listened to Eun Jeong, but you all had a say.

509
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:12,450
Hey, we need to get there quickly, congratulate CEO Ok, light candles and stuff.

510
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,600
- What? 
 - You've got to be kidding.

511
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,910
- The cake. 
 - Geez.

512
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:17,980
Geez.

513
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,750
I told you to remember to bring it, didn't I?

514
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,920
You never do anything right.

515
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,960
Hyeon Seong always brought a cake for Seong Ok.

516
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,490
How is he supposed to bring one?

517
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:31,370
Hey, cut the nonsense. Where's the bakery?

518
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:34,130
Kim Hyeong Seop, you lead the way.

519
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,760
But you know I paid for all this, right?

520
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,330
Thank you.

521
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,200
Thanks.

522
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,620
I'm not thankful at all.

523
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,510
Seop Seop, I appreciate it.

524
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,500
Fighting.

525
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,770
Hold on. This is really heavy. It's earthenware.

526
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,000
Is this good?

527
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,970
Hey, you came.

528
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:07,500
I'm glad you're here. Please check if it's level.

529
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,650
Move it down a bit.

530
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:20,350
What are you doing? Move it down a bit.

531
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,830
A little lower.

532
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,120
This much?

533
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,150
Yes, that's good.

534
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:39,300
You're good.

535
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,810
What would you do without me?

536
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,890
Is that why you moved to a studio nearby?

537
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,830
Congratulations on opening Ok Jewelry.

538
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:00,300
   

539
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:04,650
How are you these days?

540
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,470
Me?

541
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,370
I'm busy...

542
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,670
conquering the world.

543
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,920
You haven't changed.

544
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,140
Is that a compliment or not?

545
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,200
What do you think?

546
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,210
Is it him? Hey!

547
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,600
Help me carry this. It's so heavy. So heavy.

548
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,280
- Should we leave? 
 - No, come in.

549
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,370
- Come on in. 
 - Come in.

550
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,090
- Can we? 
 - Yes.

551
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,030
Let's go in. I need to set this down.

552
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,800
- Congrats. 
 - Thank you.

553
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,840
You came. Welcome.

554
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,870
Why did you bring so much?

555
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,320
It's the least we could do.

556
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,800
Gosh, what's gotten into you?

557
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,240
Congratulations, Seong Ok.

558
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,710
Thank you.

559
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,470
Ok, your office is so pretty.

560
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,760
- Really? Is it okay? 
 - Yeah.

561
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,410
Ok, you're successful.

562
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:03,810
I'm just getting started.

563
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,090
Let's get our wedding rings here, babe.

564
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,680
Are we getting married?

565
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,730
We will eventually, right?

566
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,200
I heard something on the way here.

567
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,760
What is it?

568
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,830
I mean, eventually.

569
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:03,060
   

570
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:10,560
♫  Whenever I was struggling, I called you without realizing it and bothered you  ♫

571
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,450
♫  But you let me be by your side  ♫

572
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:20,330
♫  With a mischievous smile  ♫

573
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:22,320
Action.

574
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,530
I was really hungry.

575
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:29,030
Did you make this kimchi yourself? It's so delicious.

576
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:31,880
Skip a bit. Skip two beats.

577
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,800
 Skip three beats. One, two, three, four! 

578
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,260
What's this?

579
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,510
Why can't you hold my hand?

580
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,090
You were supposed to go first, I thought...

581
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:49,760
I'm so sad that it's over.

582
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,420
It feels like it was yesterday when we did a table read.

583
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,910
Every moment was so precious.

584
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:58,060
We worked on the show affectionately.

585
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:02,060
I hope we can share the heartwarming moments with you.

586
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,180
Thank you so much for watching "Between Him and Her."

587
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,560
I'll be able to remember it as a very happy memory.

588
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,800
- Are you crying? 
 - Don't cry!

589
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,420
He's crying!

590
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,980
Okay, Seong Ok. Cry.

591
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:20,780
Are you crying? Why aren't you crying?

592
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,280
You saw my tears of love for "Between Him and Her," right?

593
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,010
I love "Between Him and Her" very much.

594
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,870
I hope you can feel it, too.

595
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,760
One, two, three.
