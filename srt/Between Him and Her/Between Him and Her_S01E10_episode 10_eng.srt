1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,740
 - What's this? 
 - This? 

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,240
 It's kimbap. I made it in the morning. 
   

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,570
 - Wow, really? 
 - Yes. 

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,270
 - Let me try one. 
 - No. It's only good if we eat it at the theme park. 

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,860
 Come on. Let me try just one. 

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,510
 And you made it. It'd be good wherever I eat it. 

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,660
 No, no. 

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,560
 By the way, 

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,650
 why do you want to go to a theme park instead of a pool in summer? 

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,470
 Because... 

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,260
 Oh, the bus is here. 

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,670
 Let's get going first. 

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,730
 Tell me after we get on. 

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,570
- It's a theme park. 
 - It's a theme park.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,430
What? Are you sure you didn't plan this beforehand?

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,230
How did you come up with the same idea?

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,640
I know, huh?

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,990
I love it.

19
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:14,960
You'd want to fall in love with someone when you're at a theme park on a sunny day.

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,910
Why don't we do this, then?

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,100
"Lovers at the theme park on a hot summer day."

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:27,710


23
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,990
For Winders and Jewelry A's concept keywords...

24
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,080
I chose connectivity, similarity, and diversity.

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,040
The keywords for the consumer will be relatability, excitement, and shine.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,170
The reason is the connection between us and jewelry...

27
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,790
and so forth.

28
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:54,090
I tried coming up with something all demographics can enjoy.

29
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,730
- I love that idea. 
 - Really?

30
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,580
- Don't you agree? 
 - Thank you.

31
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,600
We work so well together.

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,320
This was our first concept meeting, but we came up with the same concept and ideas.

33
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,700
It's like we've been working together for years.

34
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,240
We worked so hard. Should we take a break over coffee?

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,130
Yes, sounds good.

36
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,540
- What would you like? 
 - I'll have an iced Americano.

37
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,680
One iced Americano.

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,270
Same for Hyeon Seong, right? How about Team Leader Han?

39
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,600
- Vanilla latte. 
 - Vanilla latte.

40
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,960
Your blood sugar drops around this time of day. So...

41
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,990
I thought it'd be nice to have something sweet.

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,970
Why don't we make it iced, too?

43
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,500
What? It's so specific.

44
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,320
Huh? Do you two already know each other?

45
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,930
Did you know... 
    

46
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,260
I was coming here?

47
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,310
No.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,820
How about you?

49
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,720
Of course, I didn't know.

50
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,290
I never would've thought you'd be at Winders.

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,500
H2 didn't join them.

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,460
I'm their designer.

53
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,480
I meant it positively.

54
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,060
Thank you.

55
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,450
You did great, too.

56
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,140
Yes.

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,500
Well...

58
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,890
Work is still work.

59
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,290
Don't worry so much.

60
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,640
I won't.

61
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,400
I'm not sure how this would sound,

62
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,330
but...

63
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,530
I think it's nice that we get to work together.

64
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,630
We've...

65
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,390
always wanted to do this together.

66
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,590
The situation changed a bit,

67
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,570
but I'm glad that we get to work together...

68
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,670
like this.

69
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Let's make this work.

70
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,670
Let's do that.

71
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,810
You know...

72
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,560
He's waiting.

73
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,900
What?

74
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,750
Your Hubae.

75
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,590
Oh, right.

76
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,770
I'll get going.

77
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,440
Okay.

78
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,910
You worked so hard today.

79
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,100
- You were very good at talking. 
 - Really?

80
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,100
I was so nervous earlier.

81
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,550
   

82
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,020
Our project will go well, right?

83
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,410
We need to make sure it does.

84
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,000
Nuna.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
Yes?

86
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,420
I'm okay.

87
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,020
So focus on yourself from now on.

88
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,050
I know what you're thinking,

89
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,670
but I can do it.

90
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,840
I'll make sure it doesn't affect work.

91
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,580
I didn't say anything.

92
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,980
Something must be bothering you.

93
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,630
I'm busy. Could you give me some space?

94
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,690
I was blocking your path while you were busy.

95
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,360
Good luck.

96
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,170
 Let go of my girlfriend's hand, okay? 

97
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,440
No! Gosh.

98
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,340
What do I do?

99
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,950
Gosh, it's not working.

100
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,240
   

101
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,990
 Pig, I'm in trouble. 

102
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,340
 My laptop died. 

103
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,950
 You're good with machines. 

104
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,500
 Please help me. Crying emoji. 

105
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,860
 I tried not to care if she contacted me, 

106
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,150
 but I'm getting excited again. 

107
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,930
Oh Fatty!

108
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,930
Hey.

109
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,560
   

110
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,100
Hey, why are you bothering me so much?

111
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,730
Just hire someone at times like this.

112
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,210
They said it'd take days.

113
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,070
I need to fix it today.

114
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,040
Thank you in advance.

115
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Lead the way.

116
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,080
You're the best, Oh Fatty.

117
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,120
Would you like something to drink?

118
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,410
You said it's an emergency.

119
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,670
Let me finish this first.

120
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,380
Okay.

121
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,190
Gosh, whoa!

122
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,240
You're the best, Oh Fatty. You're so cool.

123
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,300
That's it, right?

124
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,280
- I'll get going. 
 - Hold on.

125
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,440
I should buy you a drink, since you came all the way here to help me.

126
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,170
It's still broad daylight.

127
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,080
You want to start drinking now?

128
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
It will get dark by the time I'm done with this.

129
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,230
Well, I guess.

130
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,430
I'll be done in no time.

131
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,050
Just wait a moment.

132
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,980
Okay.

133
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,950
 She's pretty. 

134
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,910
You don't mind me looking around, right?

135
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,580
Sure.

136
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,630

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,260
Huh?

149
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,470
Yes.

150
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,050
I'll finish the rest.

151
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,810
Go ahead, then.

152
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,300
 What was that? 

153
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,750
 What's with the subtle awkward feeling I'm getting from Min Hyeok? 

154
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,600
You're going all the way to Neverland because of the project with Hyeon Seong?

155
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,040
Yes. I think I'd better go there.

156
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,980
What a small world. How did you run into him there?

157
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,600
I know. Did you know he was working for Winders?

158
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,700
No, I haven't hung out with them in a while, too.

159
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,380
I see.

160
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,460
I should've been there.

161
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,040
Are you teasing me? I was wondering if I should leave the project.

162
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,700
Why would you leave? Did Hyeon Seong say he's uncomfortable?

163
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,760
Tell him to leave if that's the case.

164
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,840
No, it's not him. I feel uncomfortable.

165
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,000
And I'm stuck between him and Geon Yeop.

166
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,020
Do you worry about Geon Yeop now?

167
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,880
Why tire yourself out?

168
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,320
Just focus on yourself.

169
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,910
Wouldn't that project help your career?

170
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,880
That's why you want to go all the way to Neverland.

171
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,370
Yes, that's why it's annoying.

172
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,180
Yes, you're right.

173
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,100
It's not easy to forget the one you loved.

174
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,500
You told me to forget before.

175
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,530
What?

176
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,950
Have you been thinking about Im Jun Su since then?

177
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,070
No, I'm not.

178
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,700
I told you to let him go.

179
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,260
Why? Do you miss him again?

180
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,870
It's not that.

181
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,520
I'm just kind of curious about what he's like now.

182
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,860
What he's like? I'm sure he looks older now.

183
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,980
Hey.

184
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,300
What time is it? I need to get going now.

185
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,710
Really?

186
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,210
Bye, then.

187
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,370
Only focus on yourself, okay?

188
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,620
Worry about yourself.

189
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,150
Hey.

190
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,590
The first love is only beautiful if you leave it that way.

191
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,820
It feels like we switched roles.

192
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,190
Bye.

193
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,140
See you.

194
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,380
   

195
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,910
I heard Team Leader Han of Jewelry A went to Neverland.

196
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,310
She's a proactive designer.

197
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,180
Will she come up with an amazing idea?

198
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,780
Why are you telling me that now?

199
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,310
Because I heard it just now.

200
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,920
What are you doing?

201
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,090
I'll be working offsite today.

202
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,400
I thought you were lying when you suggested we meet again.

203
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,390
But you weren't.

204
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,070
No.

205
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,180
It's been forever since I've been to a movie theater.

206
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,930
Really?

207
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,100
Yes.

208
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,550
- Why? 
 - I guess...

209
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,990
you meant it when you said you don't do relationships.

210
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,940
Well, I suppose I did.

211
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,690
So this is a bit of a special occasion, then.

212
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,350
Huh?

213
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,060
Yes, I suppose.

214
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,850
- But we're not in a relationship yet? 
 - What?

215
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,860
Why are you so surprised?

216
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,580
Well, it's not that.

217
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,810
Be quiet and look at the screen. The movie is starting.

218
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,590
What should we do after the movie?

219
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,370
Let's grab a drink nearby...

220
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,140
No, instead...

221
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,040
let's get dinner.

222
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,520
Sounds good.

223
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,650
   

224
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,060
 Are these really that good? 

225
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,880
 Yes, they're amazing. 

226
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,050
 Aren't they the same as the ones you get anywhere else? 

227
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,370
 No, they taste special because you're eating them at a theme park. 

228
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,430
 Here are your churros. 

229
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,370
 Oh, okay. 

230
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,910
 Here they are! 

231
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,970
 Ta-da. 

232
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,210
 You look at them more adoringly than you do when you look at me. 

233
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,530
 You're not as sweet as churros. 

234
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,040
 - What? 
 - I'm kidding. 

235
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,990
 Eat quickly. It's good if you eat it before it gets cold. 

236
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,650
 Come here. 

237
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,050
 Geez, it's all over your face. 

238
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,470
I'll have one churro.

239
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,520
Got it.

240
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,350
I'll have one churro.

241
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,390
Okay.

242
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,320
Jeong Hyeon Seong.

243
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,490
Hey, Seong Ok.

244
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,950
What are you doing here?

245
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,740
Well...

246
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,390
I wanted to do some research.

247
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,360
I see.

248
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,900
Thank you.

249
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,860
Here you go.

250
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,280
Neverland is known for its churros.

251
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,140
Yes.

252
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,040
Is it good?

253
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,380
Yes, it is.

254
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,050
Is it on my face?

255
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,740
Oh, here.

256
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,460
We used to go to theme parks often in the summer.

257
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,040
Do you remember?

258
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,060
Yes, we did.

259
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,850
You always suggested going to theme parks in the summer.

260
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,140
People usually go to the beach or pools in the summer.

261
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,530
It was kind of unusual.

262
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,950
Could you call it special instead of unusual?

263
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,450
Okay, okay.

264
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,940
You didn't even know how to enjoy churros at a theme park, but I taught you.

265
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,530
I'll admit that.

266
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,540
It definitely doesn't taste the same in other places.

267
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,950
Right?

268
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,730
Yes.

269
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,130
I think I've asked why you like going to

270
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,010
theme parks in summer.

271
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,140
You must've forgotten.

272
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,620
No, I remember.

273
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,010
Because it's not crowded.

274
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,550
You said the exact same thing then, too.

275
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,380
You forgot that, too, didn't you?

276
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,250
Did I?

277
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,340
Being together like this feels like...

278
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,740
I'm here to work.

279
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,950
I need to get going now.

280
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,780
Seong Ok,

281
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,920
how about... we walk around together?

282
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,650
What?

283
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,040
Is it kind of weird?

284
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,320
It's not that, but...

285
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,300
it's a big place.

286
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,560
We'll see more if we split up.

287
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,280
Right.

288
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,960
I wasn't thinking clearly.

289
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,790
It's okay.

290
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,050
I'll get going now, then.

291
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,800
Okay.

292
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,950
Good luck.

293
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:03,420
 By the way, why do you want to go to a theme park instead of a pool in summer? 

294
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,360
 Because... 

295
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,690
 Oh, the bus is here. 

296
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,450
 The weather is amazing. 

297
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,130
 It really is. 

298
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,290
 So why the theme parks in summer? 

299
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,610
 Theme parks in the summer feel like a jewelry box. 

300
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,690
 - Jewelry box? 
 - Yes. 

301
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:31,490
 Didn't you ever think the rides looked like jewelry? 

302
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,710
 - Jewelry? 
 - Yes. 

303
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,510
 The hot balloon rides, merry-go-rounds, 

304
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,580
 and the Ferris wheels. They're pretty. 

305
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,750
 And the way roller coasters flip like this looks like a ring. 

306
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:50,660
 And the theme park sparkles in the sun in the middle of summer. 

307
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,590
 That looks like a jewelry box. 

308
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,460
 That's why I like it. 

309
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,920
 - Huh? 
 - I thought it was because it's less crowded. 

310
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,090
 Come on. 

311
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,490
 Seriously. That's so Jeong Hyeon Seong. 

312
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,010
 If we put a miniature rollercoaster 

313
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,610
 in this couple's ring, 

314
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,170
 the jewelry box will be completed, right? 

315
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,130
 Don't try to actually do that, okay? 

316
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,770
 - Who do you think I am? 
 - Huh? 

317
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,050
 I'm Jeong Hyeon Seong. 

318
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,000
 I know. You're Jeong Hyeon Seong. 

319
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,930
Gosh, I want to eat so many things.

320
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,710
Why do they all look so good?

321
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,010
Should you be that serious about picking fried chicken?

322
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,130
This is no good. You pick one.

323
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,280
I'm here to treat you.

324
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,370
What's gotten into you?

325
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,280
- You decided already? 
 - Yes.

326
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,080
We'll have one order of spicy garlic wings and two 500-cc  (~ 16.9 oz)  glasses of beer.

327
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,690
And we'll have a tteokbokki, too.

328
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,260
Okay.

329
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,640
Oh, we'll have a pineapple soda and a frozen glass, too.

330
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,350
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

331
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,500
What?

332
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:24,150
You said ordering tteokbokki at a fried chicken place is disrespectful to the chicken.

333
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,130
I know you like eating them together.

334
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,800
Here's your soda.

335
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,920
Thank you.

336
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:38,770
 I've been feeling awkward since earlier. Why is that? 

337
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,660
Here. Drink it.

338
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,450
Okay.

339
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,160
Why a-aren't you eating?

340
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,870
Didn't you say you don't like wings before?

341
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,860
I tried them, and they weren't too bad.

342
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,490
Right? That's why, right?

343
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:39,010
Once you fall for wings, there's no going back.

344
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,540
Let's drink.

345
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,380
Okay.

346
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,410
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

347
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,650
Gosh, that's too funny.

348
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,940
Did it really?

349
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,990
I'm serious. He fell while walking, and the insole popped out.

350
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,280
And it was this thick.

351
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,980
That's too funny.

352
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,120
Look, I'm crying.

353
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,720
Why is it so fun hanging out with you?

354
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,780
I think someone's calling me.

355
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,750
I'll answer this real quick.

356
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,830
Okay, go ahead.

357
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,060
Yes, Geon Yeop. I came up with an idea for the concept proposal.

358
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:24,050
Could I present it in addition to what you sent me in the next meeting?

359
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,560
- Did you take those recently? 
 - Huh?

360
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,990
- Yes. 
 - They look great.

361
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:43,460
Right, Winders called and said they wanted to supplement the concept proposal.

362
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,470
Is that so?

363
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,030
What idea was it?

364
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,880
They said they'll tell us in the meeting.

365
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,460
I see.

366
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,210
 I'm pretending we're just friends to hang out like we used to. 

367
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,270
 I'm trying to hide my feelings, 

368
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,900
 but I can't hide them whenever I'm in front of her. 

369
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,240
 And I keep having hopes. 

370
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,280
What? Are you falling asleep, Oh Fatty?

371
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,800
Hey.

372
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,710
Hey, Oh Min Hyeok.

373
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,530
Yes.

374
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,010
I'll go to the restroom.

375
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,820
Okay.

376
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,090
I'm sorry.

377
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,830
Are you okay?

378
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,970
Yes, the restroom is...

379
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,690
- She must be drunk... 
 - Go outside and turn left.

380
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,540
The passcode is 4885*.

381
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,400
Thank you.

382
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,560
4885*. 4885*.

383
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,140
   

384
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,340
Excuse me.

385
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,510
Wake up. Excuse me?

386
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,800
She can't sleep here.

387
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,380
Gosh, my throat.

388
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,050
What's taking Kim Hyeo Ryeong so long?

389
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,760
Did she fall asleep somewhere again?

390
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,100
- Is the restroom for both men and women? 
 - Yes.

391
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,520
Hey.

392
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,990
You crazy bastard.

393
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,120
Hold on.

394
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,380
I think you're mistaken. Hold on.

395
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,720
Mistaken, my foot.

396
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,620
Hold on.

397
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,670
Sir, we have a problem outside.

398
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,260
The customers are fighting!

399
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,100
- Hold on, hold on! 
 - Get in here.

400
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,210
Hold on. Don't do this.

401
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,540
Come on. Seriously!

402
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,800
What's going on? What's wrong?

403
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,980
You're dead.

404
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,360
Min Hyeok!

405
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,560
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

406
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,200
What's going on?

407
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,620
Hold still.

408
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,990
He needs to be beaten to death.

409
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,660
Sir, Sir!

410
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,300
Please stop!

411
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,710
What's wrong with you? Why are you stopping me?

412
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,410
I got punched. Why are you stopping me?

413
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,730
Oh Min Hyeok!

414
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,650
I don't know what caused the misunderstanding, but please stop.

415
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,380
Misunderstanding? Misunderstanding?

416
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,540
Do you want to hear what that bastard did to my friend?

417
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,020
He tried to kiss her when she fell asleep in the restroom.

418
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,570
Misunderstanding?

419
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,970
No, I didn't.

420
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,550
I was too drunk that...

421
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,130
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

422
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,470
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

423
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,790
Where are you going, I asked!

424
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,260
Call the police and take care of it.

425
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,980
Please call them right now.

426
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,230
A bastard like that should get locked up for at least ten years.

427
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,110
Please call right now.

428
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,850
Hey.

429
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,520
I'm sorry.

430
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,050
You must've been very scared.

431
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,880
Hye Ryeong...

432
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,090
Why would you be sorry?

433
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,560
I'm sorry.

434
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,680
But why do you keep crying?

435
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,410
I don't know.

436
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:16,650
How annoying. That pervert.

437
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,950
Are you okay?

438
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,980
Why am I so pathetic?

439
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,910
You're not pathetic at all.

440
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,150
I fell asleep at the bar.

441
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,310
And I'm clumsy, as you've said.

442
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,260
I hate myself.

443
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,100
It's his fault for messing with someone asleep.

444
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,330
There's nothing wrong with falling asleep.

445
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,530
You didn't do anything wrong.

446
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,780
So don't blame yourself.

447
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,460
Geez.

448
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,870
Thinking about it, he didn't even apologize to you.

449
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,830
Gosh, it's pissing me off.

450
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,240
Are you okay?

451
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,230
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

452
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:26,160
I'm okay. I just need a band-aid.

453
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,760
What in the world? Seriously.

454
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,370
I'm sorry.

455
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,830
It's my fault.

456
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,360
Stop apologizing.

457
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,330
It's not your fault.

458
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,620
It's his fault.

459
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,600
No, it's just that...

460
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,850
We wouldn't have come here if I didn't call you today.

461
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,730
This wouldn't have happened, either.

462
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,640
Because you're my friend, you—

463
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,260
I didn't do that because I'm your friend.

464
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,130
What?

465
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,770
It's because I like you.

466
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:20,180
 Those words came out at the moment I didn't even expect. 

467
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,790
   

468
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:52,450
 The rides that are sparkling in the blazing sun in the summer as jewelry, 

469
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,050
and the theme park where those rides are as a jewelry box.

470
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:02,090
I want the people who see this ad to feel excited, like they're opening a jewelry box.

471
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,810
And that excitement becomes familiar over time

472
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,780
and as time passes, you long for it.

473
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,960
I want to give the consumers fond memories through our collaborative editorial.

474
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,200
Wow, my heart actually fluttered just now.

475
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,740
This is like a film. A film.

476
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,190
This is totally amazing.

477
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,800
How did you come up with an idea like this?

478
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,000
It's all thanks to Team Leader Han.

479
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,330
Oh, really?

480
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,560
Well, I was just—

481
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,360
The idea she suggested...

482
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,250
helped me a lot.

483
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,600
Oh, I see.

484
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,240
Our team has amazing synergy.

485
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,140
Let's take a look at the list of theme parks, then—

486
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,530
I suggested Neverland for the theme park.

487
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,460
Neverland will be good to show the sun in summer.

488
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,600
I suppose it'd be good to show the sparkle.

489
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,770
I've been thinking about that, too.

490
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:13,080
It might be difficult to shoot at Neverland since it's so big.

491
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,130
So I think we should get a different spot—

492
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:21,360
No, I think Neverland is perfect to express the feelings of summer.

493
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,640
I agree with that.

494
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,910
We could contact them, right?

495
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:27,310
Yes, of course. I'll get that going.

496
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:32,450
Then, let's each prepare our part and meet on the shooting day.

497
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,260
Sounds good.

498
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,310
If you need anything,

499
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,740
feel free to reach out anytime.

500
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,420
Yes, I'll contact you after checking the status.

501
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,830
- Sounds good. 
 - Let's wrap up today's meeting for now.

502
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,020
Merchandiser Kim, let's chat for a moment.

503
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,990
Oh, okay.

504
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,930
You did great today.

505
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,650
See you next time.

506
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,810
Yes, see you.

507
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,910
Wait, Seong Ok...

508
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,910
Sorry.

509
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,270
I forgot my file.

510
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,290
Oh, the file?

511
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:52,490
 Why am I feeling the excitement I've been longing for only now? 

512
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,380
Well, Seong Ok...

513
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,070
At Neverland on the shooting day...

514
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,460
Well...

515
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,870
Nuna, will you take long?

516
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,040
I'll talk to you later.

517
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,030
- Shall we? 
 - Yes.

518
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,660
The parking pass. I'll meet you downstairs.

519
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,280
Okay.

520
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:20,450
Well, at Neverland...

521
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,440
Could you wait for me in the central plaza

522
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,570
after the shoot?

523
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,640
I need to tell you something.

524
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,340
Okay?

525
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,420
♫  Why is it so sweet?  ♫

526
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,290
Are you going downstairs?

527
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:44,600
♫  Why is it so sweet?  ♫

528
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,220
No.

529
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,850
Thank you for today.

530
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,460
Thank you.

531
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,180
♫  I think about it again  ♫

532
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,640
You haven't gone downstairs yet.

533
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,270
No.

534
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,070
♫  We were stars in the night sky  ♫

535
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,060
♫  Every time  ♫

536
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,360
♫  Every day  ♫

537
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,830
♫  Remember when the stars were shining?  ♫

538
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:19,730
♫  Every time  ♫

539
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:24,140
♫  Every day  ♫

540
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,910
 I want to believe that it's not too late. 

541
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,620
♫  You and I are still stars  ♫

542
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:47,380
♫  We don't shine, but I hope we don't disappear  ♫

543
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:51,920
♫  We were stars in the night sky  ♫

544
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,780
♫  Every time  ♫

545
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,210
♫  Every day  ♫

546
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:03,530
 Could you wait for me in the central plaza after the shoot? 

547
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:06,540
♫  Every time  ♫

548
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,260
♫  Every day  ♫

549
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,310
Look over here.

550
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,320
Okay.

551
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,930
Yes.

552
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,350
How about something like this?

553
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,820
Yeah. I think it's great.

554
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,430
Hyeong, why didn't you check properly?

555
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,870
We have no choice.

556
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,520
I'll go to the shoot instead.

557
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,250
 You'll have to inspect the damaged goods at the office. 

558
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,610
- But the shoot— 
 - It's your responsibility.

559
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:57,490
Do you want me to do it?

560
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,480
What do you think, Team Leader Han?

561
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,210
Pardon?

562
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:20,330
Don't you think this project will turn out well?

563
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,110
Yes.

564
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,110
Hello? Yes.

565
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:56,680
It's No. 3. No. 3.

566
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,710
It's out of battery.

567
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:05,740
 Okay, thank you! 

568
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,130
Thank you. Thank you.

569
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,340
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

570
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,850
Team Leader, I think it'd be a total hit.

571
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,570
Good, good, good.

572
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:19,720
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you. Thank you.

573
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:40,190
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

574
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,820
You did great, Nuna.

575
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,990
You, too.

576
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,490
Let's go. I'll drop you off on the way.

577
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:51,060
Oh, okay.

578
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,680
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

579
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:12,510
What?

580
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:41,900
You need to leave since we're about to close soon.

581
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,210
Okay. Could I wait a bit longer before I leave?

582
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,500
You need to make it quick.

583
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,000
- And return the entrance pass when you leave. 
 - Oh, okay.

584
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,550
   

585
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,080
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail 

586
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,620
 and there will be an additional charge after the beep. 

587
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,310
   

588
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,780
What did you expect, Han Seong Ok?

589
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:29,860


590
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,200
Shit.

591
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,990
Excuse me, what are you doing?

592
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,600
I'm sorry.

593
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,330
By chance...

594
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,830
is anyone from the film crew still in there?

595
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:59,250
They all left. Don't you know what time it is? It's late.

596
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,650
Please leave.

597
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,120
Why would you kick the gate?

598
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,160
It's late.

599
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,510
It's late.

600
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:21,570
♫  I feel like I'm in love  ♫

601
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:27,930
♫  I know it looks weird, but walk on the road singing ooh-ooh-ooh  ♫

602
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:33,580
♫  I fall in love with you  ♫

603
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:40,650
♫  When you're in my arms, it's better we are singing ooh-ooh-ooh  ♫

604
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:52,960
♫  From downpour to the rainbow  ♫ 
 ♫  Anything looks great  ♫

605
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,860
♫  From the sun to midnight moon  ♫

606
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,980
♫  When I'm with you, when I'm with you  ♫

607
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:04,990
♫  From downpour to the rainbow  ♫ 
 ♫  Anything looks great  ♫

608

00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:30,090
♫  When you're in my arms, it's better we are singing ooh-ooh-ooh  ♫

612
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:36,130
♫  You asked me another day, "Will you love me forever?"  ♫

613
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,290
♫  And I said, I'm not the type...  ♫

614
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:41,540
 Bo Ram, you like chocolate cookies, too. Why did you give it to her? 

615
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:42,900
 Do you want some of my steak? 

616
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,060
 You like stealing my food. 

617
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,290
 Because I like Hye Rin. 

618
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:51,420
 I'm not asking you to reciprocate. 

619
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,140
 I'm not asking you to go out with me, either. 

620
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:59,090
 We can no longer be friends like we used to, right? 

621
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,600
 Friends? 

622
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,880
 Can you be friends with me? 

623
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,380
 I don't think I can. 

624
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,420
 Let's stop feeling hurt. 

625
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,790
 Let's go back to then. 

626
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,940
 Geez! 

627
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,200
 - W-What? 
 - Hey. 

628
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,640
 I'm Jeong Hyeon Seong, the CEO of H2. 

629
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,730
 I'll focus more on the jewelry line in addition to the fashion line. 

630
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:26,160
 I couldn't envision H2 without you. 

631
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,140
 Let's become successful for sure. 

632
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,360
 Let's prove it to those who said we couldn't do it. 

633
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,790
 We need to do it for ourselves. 

634
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:36,600
 We can keep working together that way, no? 

635
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,840
 I really want you to come. 

636
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,490
 I'll leave now. 

637
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,150
 Are you getting in? 

638
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:47,660
♫  I fall in love with you  ♫
