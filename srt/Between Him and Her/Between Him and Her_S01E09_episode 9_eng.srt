1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,440
   

2
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:21,850


3
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,200
Nuna.

4
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,350
Geon Yeop, what are you doing here?

5
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,780
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,480
I lied to you about something.

7
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,000
To be honest,

8
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,200
I heard why Hyeon Seong refused to join Winders.

9
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,420
 By the way, 

10
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,060
 did you hear anything about H2 by chance? 

11
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,050
 They didn't say much. 

12
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,700
Because Winders only wanted the clothing line,

13
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,490
he decided to turn them down in consideration of you.

14
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,760
Saying he couldn't join them by himself.

15
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm sorry for telling you that now.

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,940
No, thank you for telling me that now, at least.

17
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,560
Also, I need to tell you something.

18
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,500
Tell me something?

19
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm not sure if this is the right time,

20
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,120
- but I— 
 - Geon Yeop...

21
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,280
like you.

22
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,800
Geon Yeop, I—

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,430
I know.

24
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,080
You haven't moved on yet.

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,810
You haven't moved on from Hyeon Seong yet, and you're...

26
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,160
on your way to meet him now.

27
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,100
But why, then?

28
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,150
I wasn't planning to confess my feelings like this.

29
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,210
But I thought I'd never get to tell you if not today.

30
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,230
I'm sorry, Geon Yeop.

31
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,610
Can't it be me?

32
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,560
I...

33
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,630
can't be the one?

34
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,070
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:32,690
♫  We're stars that shine brighter than anything in the night sky  ♫

36
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,920
♫  Everything was beautiful  ♫

37
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,500
♫  The beautiful moments  ♫

38
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,340
♫  How did our relationship end up this way?  ♫

39
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:55,250
♫  Why did our love end up this way?  ♫

40
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:01,840
♫  I think about it again, probably because I want to go back  ♫

41
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,960
♫  To the time we shined  ♫

42
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,820
♫  We were stars in the night sky  ♫

43
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,710
♫  Every time  ♫

44
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,800
♫  Every day  ♫

45
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,400
♫  Remember when the stars were shining?  ♫

46
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,280
♫  Every time  ♫

47
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,950
♫  Every day  ♫

48
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,470
   

49
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,620
Why don't you do it?

50
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,320
Hey, hey, hey. Why are you drinking alone?

51
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,540
Let's drink together. Here.

52
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,340
Yes, let us singles drink together.

53
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,980
Gosh, how offensive.

54
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,480
Stop grouping me with you like that.

55
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,230
I'm on a different level than you.

56
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,050
Oh, yeah? Different level?

57
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,940
What are you? An extra premium single pork?

58
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,880
Extra premium beef is better.

59
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,650
What are you, a single cow, then?

60
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,650
Hey, you should've eaten it right away if you put it in the fridge.

61
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,520
Don't you know it goes bad quickly?

62
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,990
I'm sorry, I forgot.

63
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,580
Seriously, where's your head at?

64
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,640
Why are you already in bed, by the way?

65
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,630
I'm tired.

66
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,690
Have you eaten?

67
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,940
I'm not hungry.

68
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,090
You were like this yesterday, too.

69
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,450
Hey, are you really sick or something?

70
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,410
I'm not sick, Mom. Please get out!

71
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,060
Gosh, look at your temper.

72
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,950
Who did you get that from?

73
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,650
Who'd live with you when you're that scary?

74
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,050
I'll live alone forever. Don't worry.

75
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,700
I committed a grave sin. Seriously.

76
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,510
Geez.

77
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,750
So annoying.

78
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,910
Well, so...

79
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,660
W-What... What are you going to do?

80
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,620
Do what?

81
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,740
I mean, w-with S-Seong Ok.

82
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,000
Do what?

83
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,040
There's nothing I can do.

84
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,440
Hey, where are you going?

85
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,310
Hyeon Seong.

86
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,500
I'll go get more alcohol.

87
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,410
- Go. 
 - Oh, okay.

88
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,350
See you.

89
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,960
Shit, why did you—

90
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Hey! Why did you ask what he'd do with Seong Ok? Were you mocking him?

91
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,630
I said the wrong thing because you kept tapping me like this.

92
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,400
You're the one who encouraged him to have a drink with Seong Ok. Why yell at me?

93
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,600
I encouraged that? I did?

94
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,700
- You did. 
 - I did?

95
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,670
Since Hyeon Seong said he's meeting Seong Ok, as his friend,

96
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,530
I was just showing my support, okay?

97
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,180
Did you or I know he'd come back without seeing her?

98
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,140
But you still did encourage it.

99
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,280
You encouraged ordering a scallion pancake earlier, but...

100
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,290
Yes, you're right.

101
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,240
But you didn't get to.

102
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,800
I left my wallet.

103
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,470
Oh, let's look for it together.

104
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,500
Oh, was it there?

105
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,300
See you.

106
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,180
Geez, we're screwed.

107
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,410
   

108
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,370
   

109
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,910
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

110
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,900
   

111
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,440
 Where are you? 

112
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,740
At home.

113
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,630
Why didn't you come?

114
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,780
Did you drink?

115
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,920
Yes.

116
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,460
You did so last time, too. Why do you drink so much?

117
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,470
Because I was upset.

118
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,250
Did you have another plan?

119
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,590
Or...

120
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,830
 did you forget? 

121
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,710
 Or... 

122
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,370
 did you feel uncomfortable about seeing me? 

123
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,330
I'm sorry.

124
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,570
 Did you wait a long time? 

125
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,280
No, I'm fine with that, but...

126
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,610
please, at least, tell me why you didn't come.

127
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,400
It didn't feel quite right to see you.

128
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,140
 Why? 

129
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,170
Because you didn't want to see me?

130
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,570
No.

131
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,100
- It's not like that. 
 - I miss you.

132
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,850
 I miss you. 

133
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,070
It still feels like we just haven't talked after a big fight.

134
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,960
 Am I... 

135
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,400
 Am I the only one who feels that way? 

136
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,200
No.

137
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,880
I miss you, too.

138
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,310
Let's meet, then. It's not too late now.

139
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,490
I miss you so much, but...

140
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't want to see you.

141
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,120
Why not?

142
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,800
 Why did you do that? 

143
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,410
You always looked bored

144
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,680
and you didn't even make eye contact.

145
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,180
Have you ever been curious about what I did all day,

146
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,620
if I got home safely,

147
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,400
or why I said I was stressed out at all?

148
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,690
 Whenever we fought, 

149
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,910
you always looked so sick of it, no matter what I said.

150
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,060
I didn't ask that much from you. I just...

151
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,370
I just wanted us...

152
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,100
I wanted us to be more curious and think about each other more.

153
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,930
 Was that really that hard? 

154
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,730
Actually, no. I'm not thinking about my faults.

155
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,200
 Hyeon Seong, by the way... 

156
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,500
Why didn't you...

157
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,490
tell me why you refused to have H2 join Winders?

158
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,830
 You must've been stressed out while seeing me, too. 

159
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,960
I should've told you first if I was upset about something.

160
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,900
But I never told you...

161
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,290
and I should've tried to come up with a better solution.

162
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,450
I'm so sorry.

163
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,180
 I'm sorry. 

164
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,630
Don't be.

165
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,210
I...

166
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,940
I'm the one who should apologize.

167
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,210
 I don't think... 

168
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:21,050
I could forget about the day I ran into you and...

169
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,630
 I'm sorry, Ok. 

170
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,830
I'll be better.

171
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,610
I promise I'll be really good to you.

172
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,280
 I'll be good to you. 

173
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,080
What if we get sick of each other again?

174
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,040
I miss you so much,

175
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,660
but I'm so afraid.

176
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,600
 When you start getting sick of me, 

177
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,310
I'll do better.

178
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,210
I'll try harder.

179
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,010
And I promise I'll be different this time.

180
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,740
 I'll work hard for you and— 

181
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,120
No, it's okay.

182
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,130
No, I...

183
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,680
It's okay.

184
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,300
I don't think this is right, Hyeon Seong.

185
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,790
I don't think we're right for each other.

186
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,080
 What are you saying all of a sudden? 

187
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,620
I'll be there right now.

188
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,360
Let's...

189
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,700
talk in person.

190
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,620
I'm sorry.

191
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,730
Don't drink too much and...

192
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,060
be well.

193
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,180
 You can't suddenly do this. 

194
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,840
Don't hang up, Seong Ok.

195
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,850
 I'll hang up. 

196
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,880
♫  Bye, I'll let everything go now  ♫

197
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,440
 Perhaps... 

198
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,050
 I might end up regretting this decision. 

199
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:09,370
 I'm sure I'll regret it when I miss Hyeon Seong unbearably. 

200
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:16,770
♫  I say goodbye now  ♫

201
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,320
 The customer is not available at the moment. 

202
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:32,790
♫  Bye, I'll let everything go now  ♫

203
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,120
 But I don't have the confidence. 

204
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,820
 No matter how much I think, the best we can do now... 

205
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,080
   

206
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,330
 is not to go back... 

207
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,450
 for each other. 

208
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,350
Right.

209
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,910
Who was it again? Sally? What happened to her?

210
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,590
I suggested meeting up,

211
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,840
but she won't respond.

212
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,790
Did I or didn't I tell you that app is a scam?

213
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,640
They always want to meet and demand money. Money.

214
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,240
What would you do if she actually came out?

215
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,230
Hyeong Seop. Seop.

216
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,530
You can't buy love with money...

217
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,320
Hey, are you okay?

218
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,640
Hey, hey, hey.

219
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,820
What are you doing?

220
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,780
You're up.

221
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,470
What's going on?

222
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,820
I'm almost done. Just wait a moment.

223
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,070
It's pretty good!

224
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,930
- Right? 
 - What in the world?

225
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,900
I used to live on my own. I can do this much.

226
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,740
Is that why you never did the dishes all this time?

227
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,250
I'll start doing them.

228
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,320
Why do you always complain when I do something nice?

229
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,740
Hold on.

230
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,380
I'll brag that you cooked for me.

231
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,420
Okay.

232
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,960
Right. Just one second.

233
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,810
What is it?

234
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,430
- Here. 
 - Huh?

235
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,240
I got you the same one.

236
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,060
You didn't have to. I don't mind using my old one.

237
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,070
The thing is...

238
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,040
it's ruined.

239
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,600
How? It looked fine.

240
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,410
It broke.

241
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,370
How did you manage to break it?

242
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,300
It broke just because I pulled it out all the way once.

243
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,440
Why is it so weak?

244
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,370
Anyway, I thought of putting it back like that,

245
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:41,370
but you'd freak out when you find out. So I got you the same one.

246
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,910
By the way,

247
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,300
you can't tell if you just look at it like this, right?

248
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,300
- You didn't notice it, either, right? 
 - No.

249
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,110
It might look fine at a glance,

250
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,360
but what broke once is bound to break again.

251
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:04,470
So, don't try to piece back together what's already broken.

252
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,020
It may look okay on the outside,

253
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,790
but it's not okay.

254
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,410
Mom...

255
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,620
Throw away the broken one...

256
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,710
and use a new one.

257
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,620
Okay?

258
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,810
All right. Should I try the delicious meal my daughter made?

259
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,370
   

260
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,350
Wow, who uses all of these, anyway?

261
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,590
I can buy one, too.

262
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:09,590
Yes, you're right, but...

263
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,330
I recommend a regular kind for minors.

264
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,020
Thank you.

265
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,460
 Everyone has healthy sex lives. 

266
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,140
 When was the last time I used one of these? 

267
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,420
Are you turned on?

268
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,050
Gosh, you scared me.

269
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,250
What is it? Why did you come?

270
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,830
What's this?

271
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:48,210
What else? It's my beautiful and flirtatious conversation with Sally.

272
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,870
 Let's meet at three tomorrow, then. 

273
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,770
- No way. 
 - What do you mean "No way"?

274
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,900
This is the difference between you and me.

275
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,480
So, are you actually going to meet a woman?

276
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,140
Why? Are you jealous that I'm flirting with someone when you have no one?

277
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,900
Jealous? Jealous?

278
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,980
Me? Jealous of you?

279
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,960
Why don't you reach out to Hye Ryeong or whatever if you're upset?

280
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,180
Shit. Why do you suddenly bring her up?

281
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,870
I gave up a long time ago.

282
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,970
Fine, I don't know if you gave up or were forced to.

283
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,670
But I'll get going. Carry on.

284
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,560
Hold on.

285
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,480
Did you come here to brag about this by chance?

286
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,540
Yes. I'll let you know how it goes.

287
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,110
You...

288
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,790
Shit, is this for real?

289
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,340
Good morning.

290
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,550
- Hello.
 - Hello.

291
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,920
Did you have a nice weekend?

292
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,870
A vanilla latte for our designer.

293
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,640
A sugary drink for more energy.

294
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,230
Have a good day, then.

295
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,270
Geon Yeop.

296
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,930
Yes?

297
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,190
Thank you.

298
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,120
For what?

299
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,420
For this.

300
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,680
I'll enjoy it.

301
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,210
You know you have to work extra hard now, right?

302
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,820
I'll get going.

303
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,710
- You can each grab a coffee. 
 - Okay.

304
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,180
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

305
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,910
Enjoy.

306
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,630
Thank you.

307
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,000
Aren't you going to eat?

308
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,850
You go first. I'll finish this up and eat later.

309
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,640
You're working on the jewelry photoshoot, right?

310
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,050
Yes. There are a lot of things to prepare.

311
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,070
Did you settle on a concept?

312
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,450
- Yes. 
 - Wow, what's with that answer?

313
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,310
Can't you just tell me now?

314
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,960
Later.

315
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,470
Okay.

316
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,840
I'll go get lunch, then.

317
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,470
Okay.

318
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,390
 I'll be dressed in yellow. 

319
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,150
Well, Sally?

320
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,980
Harry?

321
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,640
Oh, yes. I'm Harry.

322
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,870
Hello, Sally.

323
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,650
What? Do you like tall men?

324
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,680
No, just need to be taller than me.

325
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,820
Oh, really?

326
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,810
- Why? 
 - I just...

327
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,660
think it's fascinating.

328
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,400
I actually thought you wouldn't meet me after seeing my photo.

329
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,920
Why? Has it always been that way?

330
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,020
Well, no. What do you mean by "always"?

331
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,490
Are you sure?

332
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,980
Yes, looks aren't the most important thing.

333
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,490
 Is that a compliment? 

334
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,410
Where are we going?

335
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:56,130
Well, you said you like pasta. I found a good place.

336
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,940
Whoa, how impressive.

337
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,530
Let's go.

338
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,160
Wait, this way.

339
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,410
It's right across the street.

340
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,330
They're really good.

341
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,960
Okay, let's run.

342
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,840
Gosh, my knee.

343
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,750
I tripped.

344
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,050
Should we go get pasta, then?

345
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,060
There's no way Kim Hyeong Seop would...

346
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,550
Come on, no way. It's Hyeong Seop.

347
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,420
 Oh Fatty. 

348
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:03,490
 Strangely, I no longer wanted to hang out with Hye Ryeong since that day. 

349
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,910
 Thank you for keeping me company today. 

350
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,970
 I couldn't reach out since I didn't want the guys to ask me about Eun Wu. 

351
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,210
 But it was pretty neat that you showed up. 

352
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,160
 I decided to hide my feelings, 

353
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,550
 but that doesn't mean they were gone. 

354
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,410
 I miss her. 

355
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,270
Kim Hyeong Seop?

356
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,890
 What are you doing, you dummies? 

357
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,820
 Who wants to hang out with me? 

358
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,400
 I'll get you coffee if you come early. 

359
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,660
 Why are you ignoring me after reading this? I'll leave if no one comes. 

360
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,150
No, no, no!

361
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,340
Who's going to show up first?

362
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,370
Hey, Oh Fatty. Why do you look like that?

363
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,750
Why?

364
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,740
Shit...

365
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,890
It's your fault.

366
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,850
I'm busy. Why did you want me to come?

367
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,760
Are you busy? Why?

368
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,930
Busy going to the Hunting Bar again?

369
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,690
Hey, that was because...

370
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,200
I have a friend named Kim Hyeong Seop.

371
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,010
He's always been single. But he insisted

372
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:40,930
that we go there that day, so I had no choice but to go.

373
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,390
I didn't go because I wanted to.

374
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,170
Did I say anything?

375
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,910
No.

376
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,660
- But why? 
 - I-I know.

377
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,140
No one's here yet?

378
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,000
No. You came first.

379
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,550
I'm so proud of you, Oh Fatty.

380
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,100
Now we're talking.

381
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,560
I'll have the largest iced Americano.

382
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,060
I was almost touched that you ran over here.

383
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,640
Hey, don't you have hands or feet?

384
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,410
I don't have money.

385
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,630
You're still the same, Oh Fatty.

386
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,610
- Shit, you scared me! 
 - Geez!

387
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,370
Shit.

388
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,620
So you met on the app?

389
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,520
What did you want to get out of it?

390
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,710
I thought I might date him if I liked him.

391
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,370
I thought you wanted to meet people naturally.

392
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,400
Yes, but...

393
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,270
you can save time getting to know each other if you have the other person's criteria. It sounded nice.

394
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,690
So? Did you meet someone good?

395
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,010
You know my type, right?

396
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,370
Yes. Tall men.

397
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:49,200
Yes. I only care about their heights and nothing else.

398
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,710
Look at this.

399
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:55,240
It said 176 cm on his profile.

400
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,430
So I thought it wouldn't be bad.

401
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:02,700
But he put so many insoles in his shoes.

402
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,050
Gosh, this is why you can't rely on apps.

403
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,760
Let me see.

404
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,810
- Is this him? 
 - Yes.

405
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,300
   

406
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,670
What? Are you crazy?

407
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,680
Kim Hyeong Seop. What's with this photo?

408
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,350
Hey. This is hilarious.

409
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,000
Were you Sally?

410
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,410
Sally?

411
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,730
How did you know?

412
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,280
He's my friend.

413
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,060
I told you. The forever single.

414
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,330
Gosh, Kim Hyeong Seop. Seop Seop.
  ("Seop Seop" means disappointing) 

415
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,210
I'm so disappointed. 176 cm? How disappointing.

416
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,570
He was Oh Min Hyeok's friend.

417
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,200
I can't expand my social circle even through an app.

418
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,330
Gosh, how sad.

419
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,670
Geez, whatever. Should we do karaoke to relieve stress?

420
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,930
- All of a sudden? 
 - Yes.

421
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:00,740
I think I'd feel better if I screamed.

422
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,120
I don't know a single current song.

423
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,070
You never did, okay?

424
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,230
Please? Let's go. Let's go.

425
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,220
We haven't been to a karaoke in a while.

426
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,110
I guess you're right.

427
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,460
Should we go, then?

428
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,320
It probably won't be a bad idea.

429
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,720
Okay! Shall we go?

430
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,930
Go. Let me finish this and go.

431
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,770
Okay.

432
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,560
Will you sing that?

433
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,180
I have to.

434
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,770
No, don't sing that one.

435
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,850
Do it. Do it. Sing whatever you can.

436
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,420
Gosh, seriously!

437
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,510
Hye Ryeong.

438
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,500
- Hye Ryeong. 
 - Huh?

439
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,990
What's wrong?

440
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,350
It's nothing.

441
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,290
Let's go.

442
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,320
Cancel.

443
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,970
   

444
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,550
Hey, take it easy.

445
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,090
Seriously.

446
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,900
Geez.

447
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,870
Hye Ryeong, w-what's wrong?

448
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:19,850
What? Oh Min Hyeok, did you do something wrong?

449
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,000
You stole her food, didn't you?

450
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,090
No.

451
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,540
Did I do something wrong by chance?

452
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,180
Jang Eun Wu...

453
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,010
didn't join the military.

454
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,220
- What? 
 - What?

455
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,040
I saw him on the way in.

456
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,690
He's having fun in the adjacent room.

457
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,440
That f***er!

458
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,210
He lied to you, then, didn't he?

459
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,390
We shouldn't be sitting here, then.

460
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,930
Shouldn't we go and swear at him or something?

461
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,200
Hey, hey, hey. That's going too far.

462
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,320
How could you say that when your friend was betrayed?

463
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:11,100
No, Oh Fatty. Bu Ri is right.

464
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,860
That won't be necessary.

465
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,880
Shit, this is so annoying.

466
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,080
Will you really go to their room?

467
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,850
- I'm going to the restroom. 
 - Okay.

468
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,220
Hey, what are you doing here?

469
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,600
Hold still. Please.

470
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,870
 I want this moment to last forever. 

471
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,880
What?

472
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,500
Nuna.

473
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,620
It's you, isn't it?

474
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,660
What are you doing here?

475
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,550
Hey.

476
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,140
Well...

477
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:41,050
I came to the karaoke to sing.

478
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,310
What are you doing here, then?

479
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,650
Is this the military base?

480
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,330
You told her you're joining the military.

481
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,680
I just had a personal reason.

482
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,750
What personal reason?

483
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,510
Do I have to tell you that?

484
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,670
- Yes. 
 - Why?

485
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,370
Why...

486
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,110
Do you think the military is a joke?

487
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,230
Pardon?

488
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,830
Why...

489
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,900
did you do that to me?

490
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,760
It's because...

491
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,430
Let's talk outside. I can explain.

492
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,900
What?

493
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,960
Let's go out for now.

494
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,780
Let's talk privately outside.

495
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,080
Let's talk here.

496
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,820
Let's go.

497
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,160
Hey, hey...

498
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,100
 I want to protect her, but it's not my place. 

499
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,580
Let go.

500
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,260
What?

501
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,540
Are you two dating or something?

502
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,670
- What? 
 - Let go, I said.

503
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,690
What's the deal?

504
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,630
Stay out of it if you aren't dating.

505
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,310
Let go of my girlfriend's hand, okay?

506
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,920
Do you want me to repeat that?

507
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,770
No.

508
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,130
Hey.

509
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,710
If you treat my girlfriend like this one more time,

510
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,910
it won't just end this way, then.

511
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,530
Okay.

512
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,420
- You can leave. 
 - Okay.

513
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,150
Stop.

514
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,840
- Come back. 
 - Pardon?

515
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,350
Won't you apologize?

516
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,940
- I'm sorry. 
 - Do it properly.

517
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,780
Nuna, I'm sorry.

518
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,700
Geez, what the hell...

519
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,500
Are you okay?

520
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,810
Sorry.

521
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,860
Did I overreact?

522
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,540
Do you want to go talk to him?

523
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,280
No.

524
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,960
Thank you.

525
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,920
I'm glad to hear that.

526
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,400
   

527
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,700
Is the photoshoot preparation going well?

528
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,030
- Yes. 
 - Good, good, good.

529
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,280
We have a concept meeting with Jewelry A today.

530
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,790
Myeong Jin, help Hyeon Seong if he needs anything.

531
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,120
Don't think of it as someone else's project. Think of it as Winders' project.

532
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,640
Yes, of course.

533
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,870
I'll come to the meeting, too, then.

534
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,030
What?

535
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,830
Myeong Jin, I need to talk to you. So stay here.

536
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,110
Hyeon Seong, you can leave and get ready.

537
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,860
What are you doing?

538
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,240
Okay.

539
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,510
Myeong Jin, I know how you feel,

540
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,900
but it's not because I trust Hyeon Seong more.

541
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,180
I always tell you this.

542
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,950
I'm just running a business.

543
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:40,240
I give everyone a chance, but I judge based on the outcome.

544
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,260
- You get what I mean, right? 
 - Yes.

545
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,040
So you just focus on your job, okay?

546
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,740
Okay.

547
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,220
Are you nervous?

548
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,940
What?

549
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,210
No.

550
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,680
I'm okay.

551
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,920
It will go well since we came prepared.

552
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,160
Yes. I'll do my best.

553
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,770
Have you had breakfast?

554
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:18,080
- Yes. 
 - Yes, we ate before we came here.

555
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,110
This is our design office.

556
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,760
The other departments are downstairs.

557
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,160
What do you think? Nice and clean, right?

558
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,620
And over there. That's our conference room.

559
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,030
Come this way.

560
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,370
Hyeon Seong, the people from Jewelry A are here.

561
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:50,280
Oh, okay.

562
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:59,320
It's different since it's a big company, isn't it?

563
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,600
Hello, nice to meet you...

564
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,410
What are you doing?

565
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,490
Well...

566
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,190
I'm Jeong Hyeon Seong, and I'm in charge of...

567
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,590
the planning of this collaboration.

568
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,000
Nice to meet you. 
    

569
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,960
I'm Park Dong Hun from the design team.

570
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,960
I'm Kim Geon Yeop, Jewelry A's merchandiser.

571
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,450
Oh, yes.

572
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,270
This is Designer Han Seong Ok, the team leader of our design team.

573
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,220
Nice to meet you.

574
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,490
Hello, good to meet you.

575
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:35,070
Shall we have a seat, then?

576
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,950
Oh, yes.

577
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,660
Aren't you going to start?

578
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,770
Well, yes.

579
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:08,320
The collaboration we'll be working on is a summer special...

580
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,160
Jewelry A and Winders will...

581
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,120
Us, Winders will...

582
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,630
Hyeon Seong, what are you doing?

583
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,370
Hyeon Seong?

584
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,920
Shall we share our proposals first?

585
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,480
Yes. I like how straight to the point you are, Team Leader Han.

586
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:51,090
The direction we prepared is... well...

587
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:59,040


588
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,030
When it comes to summer, this is the first thing that comes to your mind.

589
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:04,150
- It's a theme park. 
 - It's a theme park.

590
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:10,740
♫  I feel like I'm in love  ♫

591
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:17,100
♫  I know it looks weird, but walk on the road singing ooh-ooh-ooh  ♫

592
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:22,700
♫  I fall in love with you  ♫

593
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,800
♫  When you're in my arms, it's better we are singing ooh-ooh-ooh  ♫

594
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,450
♫  I'm still with you  ♫ 
 ♫  From downpour to the rainbow  ♫

595
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:35,060
 We're at Neverland today. 

596
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,970
♫  From the sun to midnight moon  ♫

597
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:42,980
♫  When I'm with you, when I'm with you  ♫

598
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,150
♫  When I'm with you, when I'm with you  ♫

599
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:53,140
♫  Feel like more than great  ♫

600
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:59,850
♫  I feel like I'm in love  ♫

601
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:06,490
   

602
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:14,290
♫  I called you without realizing and bothered you  ♫

603
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:20,110
♫  But you let me be by your side  ♫

604
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,010
♫  With a mischievous smile  ♫

605
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:26,210
 I thought you were lying when you suggested we meet again. 

606
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,530
 But you weren't. 

607
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,280
 What should we do after the movie? 

608
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,580
 Let's grab a drink nearby... 

609
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,000
 No, instead... 

610
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,700
 let's get dinner. 

611
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,230
 Didn't you say you didn't like ordering wings before? 

612
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:45,600
 You said ordering tteokbokki at a fried chicken place is disrespectful to the chicken. 

613
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,540
 I know you like eating them together. 

614
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,970
 What's with the subtle awkward feeling I'm getting from Min Hyeok? 

615
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:54,110
 Min Hyeok! 

616
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:56,480
 Do you want to hear what that bastard did to my friend? 

617
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,240
 This happened because you're my friend. 

618
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,620
 It wasn't because I'm your friend. 

619
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,810
 It was because I like you. 

620
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,010
 What's this? 

621
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,920
 Don't they look like they've been working together for years? 

622
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,140
 Did you two know each other by chance? 

623
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,550
 Come on. It's all over your face. 

624
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:13,880
 Is it on my face? 

625
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,030
 No, right here. 

626
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:19,440
 On the shooting day at Neverland... 

627
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,470
 Nuna, 

628
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,910
 only focus on yourself now. 

629
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:27,540
♫  I felt anxious endlessly  ♫

630
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,010
 Could you wait for me in the central plaza after the shoot? 

631
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:34,810
♫  I've been hiding as if nothing happened  ♫

632
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:36,430
 I need to tell you something. 

633
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:42,720
♫  It's meaningless. Our long story...  ♫
