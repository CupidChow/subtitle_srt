00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,740
Hello?

8
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,240
Hey, Han Seong Ok.

9
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,190
Isn't this hard for you?

10
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,220
How can you not even call me once?

11
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,870
I think I'll die right now. Are you totally fine?

12
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,370
I miss you.

13
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,490
I miss you, I said.

14
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,760
Also, aren't you taking this too far?

15
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,370
We've been together forever. How can we break up?

16
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,830
Seriously.

17
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,300
I'm hurting.

18
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,810
Say something, at least.

19
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,170
Han Seong Ok.

20
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,510
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

21
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,880
After the beep, there will be a charge.

22
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,840
Seong Ok.

23
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,360
Did you drink?

24
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,670
Yes.

25
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,790
I drank a little with the guys.

26
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,910
Looks like you had fun.

27
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,570
Do you think...

28
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,530
Never mind.

29
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,880
I've been thinking. We...

30
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,880
What's this?

31
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,040
Did you pack your things from the studio?

32
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,040
- No.
- You've been preparing for this, weren't you?

33
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,300
It's not like that.

34
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,140
What is it, then?

35
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,580
How could you pack stuff like you've been waiting for this?

36
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,580
Do you think our time together was a joke?

37
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,150
I never said it was a joke.

38
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,660
What's this, then?

39
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,960
What's this?

40
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,360
You're drunk. Let's talk tomorrow.

41
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm not drunk. Let's talk now.

42
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,280
You are.

43
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,980
Yes. I'm drunk.

44
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,180
Will you run away using that as an excuse now?

45
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,250
What's that supposed to mean-

46
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,360
Since when did you think about breaking up with me?

47
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,920
- That's enough.
- Just say you didn't.

48
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,970
Why can't you just say that?

49
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,130
You're drunk now. I said we should talk tomorrow.

50
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,260
It's because I'm not competent-

51
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,290
- Hey.
- That's why, isn't it?

52
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,700
Let's stop. I'll go inside.

53
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,730
Don't go.

54
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,530
If you leave like this,

55
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,980
it'd feel like we're finished.

56
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,680
And think about it.

57
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,460
How can we break up? Huh?

58
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,850
Let's talk. Just one moment. I just need a moment.

59
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,770
Let's talk later.

60
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,820
Hey. Seong Ok.

61
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,600
Han Seong Ok!

62
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,180
It's so annoying.

63
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,470
What's wrong?

64
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,220
Are you okay?

65
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,010
Let me look. You're bleeding.

66
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,610
Hold on.

67
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,880
We are thinking of making it go below the hips.

68
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,150
- To there?
- Yes, yes.

69
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:22,080
We'll go with black for now, and around the neck, we're thinking of...

70
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,340
I ended up hiding without realizing it.

71
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,910
We spend the night together but don't even hold hands.

72
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,990
I...

73
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,160
used to like you.

74
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,210
She used to like me?

75
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,910
It's true I wasn't so bad when I was in middle school.

76
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,180
Has she been liking me since then?

77
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,910
Hey, Kim Hye Ryeong.

78
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,500
Wake up, Kim Hye Ryeong.

79
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,720
Wake up, I said!

80
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,460
What are you thinking?

81
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,240
What am I doing here?

82
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,900
It's because you sloshed...

83
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,640
How could a small person drink so much?

84
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,250
I should've just let you sleep on the streets.

85
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,070
You almost died, and I saved you. Yet you dare have shady thoughts about me?

86
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,230
Well, I mean...

87
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,940
I'm sorry.

88
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,770
Hey.

89
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,380
Do you remember...

90
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,340
Do you remember what you told me last night?

91
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,970
What did I say?

92
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,380
Forget it.

93
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,240
Let's not bother. I can't have a conversation with you.

94
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,500
Get up quickly. Let's go get hangover soup.

95
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,520
What? What did I say?

96
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,150
Did I say I'll treat you to a meal again?

97
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,320
Of course.

98
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,130
It's always like this whenever I'm with her.

99
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,960
Hurry. Hurry up and come out.

100
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,160
Min Hyeok, could I sleep a little longer?

101
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,420
Hurry up and come out.

102
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,640
- I'm so tired.
- They called me to come out.

103
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,810
Who called?

104
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,450
Wait for me.

105
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,420
Hey, Pig. Looking at you in daylight...

106
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,460
makes you look fatter.

107
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,990
Yeah, I got fatter. What will you do about it?

108
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,490
It's not like I'd do anything.

109
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,650
But it's a shame that you're spending your 20s as a pig.

110
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,540
Gosh, amazing.

111
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,240
Geez, you're so gross.

112
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,470
You think you're much better?

113
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,950
Isn't it attractive when a pretty girl like me is down to earth?

114
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,030
- Check your front teeth.
- What? Is something stuck?

115
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,310
Look. All good, right?

116
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,590
All good. Very clean.

117
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,330
When does your kindergarten vacation end again?

118
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,760
This week.

119
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,020
This week...

120
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,240
- What a relief.
- What do you mean?

121
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,680
You wouldn't live like this if you had somewhere to go in the morning.

122
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,560
You don't drink all night and smell like alcohol in front of the kids in the morning, right?

123
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,430
How dare you. I'm not that bad.

124
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,880
- Aren't you going to eat your seonji*?
- I am.
(Solidified cow blood)

125
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,100
Okay.

126
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,490
Are you crazy?

127
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,210
You told me to eat it.

128
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,200
I'm sorry.

129
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,390
You jerk. I meant I'll eat it later.

130
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,610
I'm doing all this for your diet.

131
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:29,190
You think I wanted to eat your left over seonji?

132
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,460
I don't have any.

133
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,360
Gosh. That was good.

134
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,310
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Pig.

135
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,760
Geez, what are you saying?

136
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,560
You definitely promised to get me hangover soup.

137
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,920
Oh, right.

138
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,600
I thought I would until you used my card to pay for the motel after I passed out drunk.

139
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,880
I knew you'd be like this.

140
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,760
I'll treat you. I'll treat you, I said.

141
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,240
It's on Noona!

142
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,600
It's missing the subject and object.

143
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,730
Come on. Whatever. You thought this would work on me?

144
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,600
Of course, I knew you'd say that, too.

145
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,560
- I, Kim Hye Ryeong...
- That's right.

146
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,270
- will buy Oh Min Hyeok...
- That's right.

147
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,050
- hangover soup...
- Okay.

148
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,950
- tomorrow.
- Okay.

149
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,860
- Wow.
- Promise.

150
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,380
Okay. I lost.

151
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,290
Geez, he somehow got smarter.

152
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,930
Yes!

153
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,430
- Here you go.
- Okay.

154
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,790
It feels like she's neither a man nor a woman. As if she's a different species.

155
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,030
But I feel comfortable when I'm with her.

156
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,710
Pay for the motel now, then.

157
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,500
Here you go.

158
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,460
- Thank you.
- Should I?

159
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,340
Thank you.

160
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,880
You can leave now. I'll take a taxi.

161
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,420
You should spend less.

162
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,440
It's my money.

163
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,260
I hope you trip, ugly duckling.

164
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,560
Right back at you.

165
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,660
Right back at you.

166
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,410

493
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,570
To be honest...

494
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,670
- To be honest-
- Hey, bro!

495
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,140
What are you guys doing here? Huh?

496
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,250
It's Hyeong Seob's birthday. Don't be so antisocial.

497
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,690
- Let's go in.
- Hold on.

498
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,460
Just talk inside.

499
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,400
Buddies, today's about Hyeong Seob, okay?

500
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,370
Hey! Were you guys drinking?

501
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,920
What? Why are you coming back with Oh Fatty?

502
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,940
We ran into each other outside.

503
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,470
We need to cut the cake together. They can't be on their own.

504
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,660
And you two.

505
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:47,820
I know you're a couple, but do you have to show off your love on your friend's birthday?

506
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,540
Do you think we haven't been in relationships?

507
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,010
What's with the vibe? Did something happen?

508
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,050
Hey, don't push your luck.

509
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,830
Why?

510
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,650
You two...

511
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,240
B-By chance...

512
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,570
d-did you break up?

513
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:22,240
Do you think you could prank me?

514
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,790
Don't do stuff like this. It's not funny anymore.

515
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,570
Let's just say you broke up. What was the plan afterward?

516
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,170
Hey, it's not like that.

517
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:32,130
What? You didn't expect me to react this way, huh?

518
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,930
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

519
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:37,260
Gosh, seriously. Can't believe I fell for your sloppy pranks.

520
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,070
Okay, I admit. Your acting improved a bit.

521
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,060
Other people would think you actually broke up.

522
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,240
Hey, why don't you actually break up this time?

523
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,720
Relationships require too much energy, money, and time.

524
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,200
Just break up. Break up. Break-

525
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,840
- Stop that.
- Seriously, stop!

526
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,190
All right.

527
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,010
Why are you overreacting?

528
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:05,240
- Come out with me.
- What? What? What? What?

529
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,170
Is this acting, too?

530
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,430
Wow, I almost got fooled again.

531
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,600
Just be quiet and go with him.

532
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,100
Come out. Gosh, you're so heavy.

533
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,860
Gosh.

534
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,070
Did I do something wrong again?

535
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,550
Why do you talk so much?

536
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,870
Why is everyone so down?

537
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,450
It's Pig.

538
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,560
Shit!

539
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,400
Why?

540
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,730
We don't know, either.

541
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,760
It's kind of serious this time. We shouldn't be joking.

542
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,530
Gosh.

543
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,250
What do I do?

544
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,770
What can you do? You didn't know.

545
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,210
Was I acting really cluelessly?

546
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,960
Yes.

547
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:52,610
You should've stopped me.

548
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:57,370
Hey. It's not just anyone. It's them. They won't break up.

549
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:00,260
I agree with you, but...

550
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,120
I don't know. It seems a bit serious this time.

551
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,100
Gosh.

552
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,450
How about Hyeon Seong? Is he okay?

553
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,790
You think he is?

554
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:12,600
Gosh, I'm screwed if they break up.

555
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,050
Why are you screwed?

556
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:18,370
I won't be able to have Seong Ok's ramen anymore.

557
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,860
Seriously.

558
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,070
I'm serious right now.

559
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,210
Hey. Isn't today a happy day?

560
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,650
Why aren't we celebrating?

561
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,420
Here.

562
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,260
You guys, take them out, too.

563
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,700
Okay.

564
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,690

565
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:53,400

What? You said you didn't bring anything.

567
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,860
Open mine first.

568
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,860
Well, right now?

569
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,400
Yes. Why? Don't you want to?

570
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,490
No. Well...

571
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,670
Okay. Geez.

572
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,990
- Do I smell?
- Yes.

573
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,150
I'm just kidding.

574
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:20,810
Go ahead and open mine, too.

575
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,160
Okay.

576
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,300
I can't believe I'm getting gifts from you guys...

577
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,450
I'm so happy...

578
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,960
I-I should open it later.

579
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:38,980
Hey. How long are you going to do this?

580
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,510
Either break up or keep seeing each other.

581
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:44,990
How can they break up?

582
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,840
I agree.

583
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,840
I... I mean...

584
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,000
We can't accept it.

585
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,370
At the beach on Christmas Eve. Remember?

586
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:58,100
We were 25 or 26 years old.

587
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,710
You guys fought a lot and talked about breaking up.

588
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,440
So, we took you to the beach, and we ate grilled clams together.

589
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,510
On Christmas Eve.

590
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,200
Why are you bringing up grilled clams now?

591
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,370
Well, I'm just saying...

592
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:15,070
I hope we can laugh about this later, too.

593
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,220
Sit down, Oh Fatty.

594
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,910
Okay.

595
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,520
Jeong Hyeon Seong, don't you have anything to say to Seong Ok?

596
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,970
Hey, hey. Don't be like that.

597
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,390
Break up if you have nothing to say.

598
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,660
You don't even appreciate her.

599
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,210
I'm against it.

600
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,940
I don't know what happened,

601
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,570
but let's just slap the back of Hyeon Seong's head and get over it.

602
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,560
I don't think you guys should break up.

603
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,860
I'm against it, too. We shared your seven-year-long relationship, too.

604
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,460
What will we do if you guys break up?

605
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,440
Should we go to the beach again? Should we?

606
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,590
Why? Why?

607
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,670
Relationships can go stale for a bit. You can't break up for that.

608
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:57,020
You've been together for seven years.

609
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,550
He doesn't know how lucky he is.

610
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:00,120
You're not successful or anything.

611
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,870
You should be thanking Seong Ok for dating you.

612
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,940
It's not like she cheated on you or anything.

613
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:07,110
It's your fault unless she did.

614
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,710
Did you say "cheat" just now?

615
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:09,810
Don't you know Ok?

616
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:14,140
She hasn't even looked at another man for seven years.

617
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,240
Am I wrong, Ok?

618
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,380
Han Seong Ok.

619
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,390
You didn't, right?

620
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,680
To be honest,

621
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,830

624
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,590
She's a female friend I have no feelings for.

625
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:16,800
It's normal to feel excited even if I don't like her, right?

626
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,770
Be honest. I'm cute, right?

627
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,780
Don't you find me cute?

628
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,970
Hye Ryeong, let's talk for a second.

629
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,470
I need to tell you something, too.

630
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:32,640
What are you guys talking about?

631

He and I have a lot in common.

632
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:38,060
Don't worry. I'll make sure no men approach her.

633
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,820
It's a secret between Hyeong Seob and me.

634
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,570
You and I are friends, too.

635
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:46,280
We shouldn't stop hanging out since you broke up with Hyeon Seong.

636
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,430
I have good news.

637
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:50,470
It'd be a shame to let a day like today go.
