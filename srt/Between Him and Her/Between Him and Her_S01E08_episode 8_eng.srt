1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,750
   

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,690
   

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,020
   

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:24,870


5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,590
   

6
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,140
   

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,560
Crazy bastard. Why did you drink?

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,940
Geez, I'll no longer drink, you losers.

9
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,150
   

10
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,450
   

11
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,440
 Hey, S-Seong Ok. 

12
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,750
Hey.

13
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,650
What made you call?

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,730
Well...

15
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,930
Have you been well?

16
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,270
Yes. Of course, I have.

17
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,210
I see.

18
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,510
How about you?

19
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,680
Have you been well?

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,570
 Well, I... 

21
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,950
I've been well, of course.

22
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,500
 I see. 

23
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,160
Well, I work at a company these days.

24
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,030
Really?

25
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,050
Where?

26
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,170
 Well, it's Win... 

27
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,360
It's just a design company.

28
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,770
I see.

29
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,510
That's great.

30
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,110
 Yes. 

31
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,880
It is great.

32
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,010
How about you? Is the work manageable?

33
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,060
 Yes. 

34
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,010
It's great. I... Well, I like it.

35
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,050
That's good to hear.

36
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,650
Were you sleeping, by chance? I stole too much of your time, didn't I?

37
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,700
No.

38
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,250
- It's ok— 
  - I'm sorry. 

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,480
 - Go to bed now.  
 - Huh?

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,240
 I'll hang up now. 

41
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,080
Okay.

42
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,070
All right.

43
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,560
 Okay. 

44
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,110
Good night.

45
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,130
I'll hang up for real now.

46
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,820
What was that? You idiot.

47
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,750
   

48
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,490
   

49
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,980
 Can we meet when you're free, by chance? 

50
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,030
 I miss you. 

51
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,720
   

52
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,290
 When? 

53
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,330
 Whenever you're free. 

54
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:21,460
   

55
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,180
 I think Saturday would work. 

56
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,550
   

57
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,460
 I'll see you then. 

58
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:37,420
   

59
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,920
   

60
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,520
 You're meeting her? 

61
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
Really?

62
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,100
- Yes. 
 - Wow, I'm nervous for some reason.

63
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,110
How did that happen, by the way?

64
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,510
Did you get drunk and call her first, by chance?

65
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,850
- Yes. 
 - And Seong Ok said yes?

66
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,050
Yes, it just happened so.

67
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,630
Wow, that's daebak.

68
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,300
It was a good thing you drank, then.

69
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,430
That gave you the courage to call, right?

70
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,020
So? When are you meeting her?

71
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,670
- Saturday. 
 - It's coming up soon.

72
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,460
Gosh, even I'm nervous. Geez.

73
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,950
- Jeong Hyeon Seong. 
 - Yes?

74
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,720
Good luck.

75
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,830
Let's have a drink with Seong Ok like we used to.

76
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,370
Okay.

77
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,430
Let's do that.

78
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,570
Okay.

79
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,630
Hey.

80
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,980
What?

81
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,180
Gosh, seriously. What do we do with poor Hyeong Seop?

82
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,430
What's wrong with me?

83
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,100
I have a woman I like, okay?

84
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,900
You've always had a lot of women you liked.

85
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,810
But the women never liked you, you are forever single.

86
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,310
That's not true. I'll finally stop being forever single this time.

87
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,900
How will you do that, exactly?

88
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,140
I signed up for a service. I get ten matches for 30,000 won  (~ $22)  per month.

89
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,790
Wow, are you serious?

90
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,450
That's all a scam.

91
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,010
No, it's not. We chat every day, too.

92
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,130
Wouldn't you say we're flirting?

93
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,530
- Do you actually chat every day? 
 - We do.

94
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,270
Every single day?

95
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,160
- Let me see. 
 - Seriously.

96
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,520
You don't believe me. We chat every day.

97
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,820
Let me see. Let me see. Let me see.

98
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,550
"Good morning." "Okay."

99
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,800
"Have a good day." "Okay."

100
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,380
"Have a nice day." "Okay."

101
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,360
"Okay. Okay."

102
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,240
You seriously think you're flirting right now, right?

103
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,160
Yeah. Aren't we?

104
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,030
We can chat longer if I buy an item.

105
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,310
Should I buy it?

106
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,460
Please, Hyeong Seop. Seop, please.

107
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,440
Kim Hyeong Seop, please!

108
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,340
What? What? What? What?

109
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,220
They say you can't spit on a smiling face, right?

110
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,520
That's all a lie.

111
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,280
I could spit on your face right now.

112
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,490
Hey, just leave him. He wants to spend his money. Let him.

113
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,590
Don't be jealous if I get a girlfriend first.

114
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,190
Jealous? Me? Of you?

115
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,600
I'd be jealous of you? Seriously.

116
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,930
You hurt my ego.

117
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,410
Oh, right. Where's Si Hu?

118
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,080
Cheers.

119
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,500
Excuse me.

120
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,210
Sure.

121
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,060
 Breaking news. Hyeon Seong and Seong Ok are meeting up on Saturday. 

122
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,550
 We'd be able to hang out all together like we used to. 

123
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,300
 To be honest, I ran into her while I was delivering. 

124
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,510
 An Sibari, talk to me one-on-one.  
  (Sibari means errand-boy, friendly nickname) 

125
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,440
 We're drinking with Hyeon Seong right now. Do you want to come? 

126
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,420
 We should drink together on a day like this. 

127
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,180
 I'm busy. 

128
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,700
Gosh, those losers.

129
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,330
Who was it, anyway?

130
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,670
I'm friends with a couple who broke up after dating a long time.

131
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,830
But they're meeting up, apparently.

132
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,570
Why bother?

133
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,140
I never get back together with someone I broke up with.

134
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,580
- Why not? 
 - What would be the point of it?

135
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,400
They'll probably break up for the same reason again.

136
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,610
It could be different.

137
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,910
People don't change easily.

138
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,090
Besides, he wouldn't have been so neglectful of me if he cared

139
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,820
and there wouldn't have been a breakup, either.

140
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,560
Once you break up, it's over.

141
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,220
He wouldn't have been neglectful if he cared, huh?

142
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,190
Yes, isn't that obvious?

143
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,570
Why? Do you tend to be negligent with your girlfriends?

144
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,960
What are you like in relationships?

145
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,410
Me?

146
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,230
I don't do relationships.

147
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,800
Oh, r-really?

148
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,390
Why?

149
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,230
Do you not like it?

150
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,810
No, no, well...

151
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,190
I guess it could be like that.

152
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,080
- Should we have the second round at a motel? 
 - What?

153
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,070
Right now?

154
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,080
Forget it if you don't want to.

155
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,500
No, no. It's not like I don't want to, but...

156
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,700
I got it.

157
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,770
Hold on, let me pay real quick.

158
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,590
I'd like to pay.

159
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,480
She has a boyfriend.

160
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,340
All women are the same.

161
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,060
Yes, I like him.

162
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,100
I really like him, I said.

163
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,550
He's fun to be with, and I want to get to know him more.

164
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,460
I know. I haven't felt this excited in a while.

165
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,530
Hey, don't worry.

166
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,470
I don't think he's a bad person.

167
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,090
Okay, I'll call you again.

168
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,500
W-When did you come back?

169
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,300
Shall we go?

170
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,190
You know, about relationships...

171
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,590
Do you feel that way with everyone, no matter who the woman is?

172
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,150
What?

173
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,460
I was just curious.

174
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,500
I'm not pressuring you. I'm just asking.

175
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,710
What do you like to do usually?

176
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:14,080
I love taking photos.

177
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,410
Do you mind if I take one of you?

178
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,920
A photo? All of a sudden?

179
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,650
Yes. This is our first date, you know.

180
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,500
I wanted to remember it.

181
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,110
Okay. Shall we take one together, then?

182
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,500
No, no. Just you, Oppa.

183
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
I'll take one.

184
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,460
What?

185
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,560
Wow, that's nice.

186
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,640
Are you sure I don't look weird?

187
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,460
No, it turned out well.

188
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,570
It feels like this moment was captured.

189
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,870
It'd feel different when time passes.

190
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,160
 I feel like you can truly capture the moment. 

191
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,350
 But you'd feel differently about this moment after time passes. 

192
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,250
Yu Na...

193
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,360
you should go home now.

194
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,990
What?

195
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,570
I just remembered something.

196
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,620
Let's call it a night and hang out again next time.

197
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,150
Next time?

198
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,960
Yes.

199
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,400
Will there really be a next time?

200
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,170
Yes, see you.

201
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,490
 Why are you suddenly doing this? 

202
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,300
 I'll be good to you. I will. 

203
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,260
 I'll never do what you don't want me to do. 

204
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,420
 I'm sorry, Si Hu. 

205
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,010
 Nuna, please. 

206
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,510
What's going on?

207
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,990
What brings you all the way here?

208
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,880
I suddenly got curious about something.

209
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,950
No...

210
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,070
It's not sudden.

211
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,490
I've been curious for the last six years.

212
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,550
Why did you do that to me?

213
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,480
Why did you do that?

214
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,420
I was...

215
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,370
young, too.

216
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,320
It took me too long to realize that breakups have to be cordial too.

217
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,870
I was six years older than you,

218
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,180
but...

219
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,750
I was 29 years old then.

220
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,250
I didn't know...

221
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,980
you'd be hurting all this time because of me.

222
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,200
Si Hu.

223
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,360
I'm sorry I hurt you.

224
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,410
I don't know if that was enough of an answer,

225
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,810
but I'll get going now.

226
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,490
Yun Yu Ju.

227
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,650
Did you even love me?

228
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,360
Answer me.

229
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,410
Did you even love me?

230
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,630
I loved you.

231
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,890
Sincerely.

232
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,200
I loved you a lot,

233
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,090
was very thankful,

234
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,410
and felt very bad.

235
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,340
♫  I think of you every time I take a step  ♫

236
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,340
When you become around my age,

237
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,470
I'd like you to understand how I feel.

238
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:20,820
♫  With my loose shoelaces  ♫

239
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:29,390
♫  I stare at the sky that changed me  ♫

240
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:38,080
♫  Slowly, a little slowly, would you get further away from me?  ♫

241
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:45,760
♫  So, we could remember our old laughter  ♫

242
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,220
 I don't know what true love is yet, 

243
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,040
 but I could tell she meant it. 

244
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:03,970
 I'm sorry, and thank you, Yun Yu Ju. 

245
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,300
Ok!

246
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,840
Hey.

247
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,410
- How are you? 
 - Why are you coming from there?

248
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,260
I walked.

249
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,310
What's going on? Where are we going that you wanted to meet at a bus stop?

250
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,500
Wait and see. Come this way.

251
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,790
- What? 
 - Be careful. Be careful.

252
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,510
What's going on?

253
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,630
Ta-da!

254
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,220
What? What's this?

255
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,610
Hey, this is so cool.

256
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,830
Are you calling yourself cool right now?

257
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,850
No, not me. I meant you.

258
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,830
You're cool, Han Seong Ok.

259
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,550
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

260
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,130
You need to talk to me about something.

261
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,390
Like what?

262
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,190
Jeong Hyeon Seong. What happened?

263
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,680
Did you come here to ask that?

264
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,180
What's more important than that?

265
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,050
Huh? Tell me right now.

266
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,930
Aren't you going to tell me?

267
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,280
Tell me. What's going on?

268
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,940
That's the most important thing.

269
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,490
- Tell me. 
 - Excuse me.

270
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,470
You're Eun Jeong Seonbaenim, right?

271
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,040
- Me? 
 - Gosh, it is her!

272
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,930
I'm on a soccer team at your high school.

273
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,450
- I see. 
 - We're big fans.

274
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,050
The school still shows videos of your games.

275
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,630
They tell us to be half as good as you.

276
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,730
Could you let us take a photo with you?

277
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,430
Yes, of course.

278
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,800
I-I'll take it for you.

279
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,530
Okay.

280
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,010
One, two, three.

281
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,930
One, two, three.

282
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,700
This is so daebak.

283
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,620
By the way, why do you no longer play soccer?

284
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,260
It's because I've been injured.

285
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,260
I'm a model now.

286
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,700
Wow, daebak.

287
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,290
You're seriously so cool.

288
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,710
Gosh, thank you.

289
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,370
Thank you so much.

290
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,400
Take care.

291
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,830
Do you miss it?

292
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,840
Not at all. It's not a good memory or anything.

293
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,630
Hey,

294
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:41,450
do you want to go to the last stop on the bus like we did in high school?

295
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,410
You suddenly want to go to the last stop?

296
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,630
Let's do it. I want to do it again.

297
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,590
What's the deal? Why, all of a sudden—

298
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,970
The bus is coming.

299
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,560
Gosh.

300
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,630
Won't you get on?

301
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,980
Hey!

302
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,340
What's going on?

303
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,880
Im Jun Su.

304
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,440
I think I saw Im Jun Su.

305
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,010
 Spin kicks are about accuracy than speed. 

306
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,890
 You have to push the ball with the big toe 

307
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,150
 and the front of your foot to spin it. 

308
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:41,020
 The key is to go with the flow rather than kicking with force. 

309
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,880
 Okay? 

310
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,940
 Are you listening? 

311
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,420
 Pardon? 

312
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,830
 Yes. 

313
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,950
 Give it a try, then. 

314
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,650
 Seonbae. 

315
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,130
 Yes? 

316
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,850
 I'll train hard and make sure to follow you to the UK. 

317
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,140
 So wait for me. 

318
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,260
You know, too, right?

319
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,960
I trained really hard to go to the UK.

320
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,170
I think that was the problem.

321
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,980
Since I was only focusing on my goal,

322
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,490
I ended up getting injured.

323
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,630
I couldn't go to the UK, either.

324
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,570
I know.

325
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,370
You took it very hard then.

326
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:41,260
I know I couldn't go because of the injury.

327
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,760
But he told me to wait. How could he date an idol as soon as he left?

328
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,440
Son of a bitch.

329
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,500
I know.

330
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,070
So?

331
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,840
What would you have done if it were really Yun Jun Su?

332
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,850
I don't know.

333
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,100
I guess I wanted to swear at him.

334
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,830
You know...

335
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,730
if I didn't work as hard,

336
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,390
and wasn't as good as others in soccer...

337
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,810
Would it have been...

338
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,700
easier to accept it?

339
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,370
Well...

340
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,880
you discovered a new career since you had to quit soccer.

341
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,240
You're doing a great job as a model.

342
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,420
You're right. I'm doing great.

343
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,280
I'm also...

344
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,360
saying you have to...

345
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,900
let him go completely to meet someone nice.

346
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,330
You can't keep having three-month-long relationships.

347
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,500
What?

348
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,890
How could you be so smart about other people's relationships?

349
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,690
You want to die?

350
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,120
Make sure you don't regret seeing Jeong Hyeon Seong.

351
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,860
Tag along if you're worried.

352
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,120
Really? Can I come?

353
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,830
- I'll sit in the corner without making a noise. 
 - No, don't.

354
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,270
Aren't you getting off?

355
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,230
This is the last stop.

356
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,190
Oh, okay. Thank you.

357
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,150
I'm sorry.

358
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,190
   

359
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,350
The ring.

360
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,500
The ring...

361
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,390
 What are you doing? 

362
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,160
 - Here's coffee. 
 - Thank you. 

363
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,300
 These are... 

364
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,420
 couple's rings for us. 

365
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,540
 Really? 

366
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,730
 Yes. 

367
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,780
 Should I make matching shirts, too, then? 

368
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,880
 - I'd hate that. 
 - Right? 

369
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,930
 Matching shirts are no good, right? 

370
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,270
 No, that's no good. 

371
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,640
 What's that? 

372
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,440
 Why is there a gap here? 

373
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,860
 - This? 
 - Yes. 

374
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,790
 Look at this. 

375
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,590
 This is where a diamond will be. 

376
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:41,940
 I'll connect the ends with a diamond here. Just like us. 

377
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,960
 Oh, really? 

378
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,880
 That's so touching. 

379
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,680
 It might be difficult now, 

380
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,790
 but let's make sure to connect it when we get married someday. 

381
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,470
 What? 

382
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,680
 When we... 

383
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,460
 get married? 

384
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,700
 Why? What was that? 

385
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,340
 - It's nothing. 
 - What's with your face? 

386
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,020
 I almost cried thinking about it. 

387
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,280
 Make the gap bigger, then. 

388
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,400
 I'll put a diamond as big as your face in it. 

389
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,260
 How would I wear it? It'd be so heavy. 

390
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,610
 No, I swear I'll get you one. I'm serious. 

391
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,790
 I'll get you one. 

392
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,070
 Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. 

393
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,330
 Okay. 

394
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,970
 Do you want to hold it? Do you want to try it? 

395
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,360
   

396
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,600
What are you up to?

397
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,800
It's nothing.

398
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,210
Where do you get stuff like this?

399
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,860
This is just...

400
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,290
Are you preparing already?

401
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,500
- Pardon? 
 - The thing I mentioned last time.

402
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,030
The jewelry project. The collaboration has been confirmed.

403
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,110
Oh, that's great.

404
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,230
It's called Jewelry A. It's an up-and-coming company.

405
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,300
Check them out and come up with ideas that suit them.

406
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,230
- Okay, I will. 
 - In my opinion,

407
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,780
I don't know if their designs are that outstanding,

408
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,870
but they do have a certain feel about them.

409
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,210
I think it'd suit the unique theme.

410
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,770
This isn't necessarily about selling products.

411
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,290
It's a concept catalog to show Winders can be versatile, too.

412
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,670
So try everything you want.

413
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,170
Thank you.

414
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,520
What are you looking at so intently?

415
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,160
What?

416
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,820
A theme park?

417
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,310
Yes.

418
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:01,110
I thought of a concept for the Winders project.

419
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,060
I see.

420
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,540
I can get excited about it, right?

421
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,620
- I'll do my best. 
 - I'll get ready for the concept meeting, then.

422
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:20,970
   

423
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,860
   

424
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:32,090
Seong Ok would've liked this.

425
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,800
   

426
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,750
It'd be better not to drink, right?

427
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,710
   

428
00:30:53,710 --> 00:31:00,250
   

429
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:07,070
   

430
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,990
   

431
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,380
   

432
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,610
This would be good.

433
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,960
Our collaboration with Winders was confirmed.

434
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,150
This is all thanks to Ms. Han.

435
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,800
This was possible thanks to all of your help. Thank you.

436
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,370
You're being modest again.

437
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,350
Everyone here knows how hard Ms. Han worked, right?

438
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,020
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

439
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,070
Shall we start the concept meeting?

440
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,510
I just printed...

441
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,260
I think I left it on my desk. I'll go get it quickly.

442
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,190
I'll grab it for you. It's on your desk, right?

443
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,380
No, I'll go...

444
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,960
 Saturday at three. Let's meet here. 

445
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,030
- Shall we take a break? 
 - Yes.

446
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,660
Oh, right.

447
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,220
Did you know there was an episode at the office?

448
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,890
Here? Why?

449
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:19,000
Jae Ho's girlfriend came here and caused a scene.

450
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,990
Someone said they saw him leaving a motel with a woman.

451
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,300
Jae Ho did?

452
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:32,060
Yes. He said he fell asleep after getting drunk, and nothing happened.

453
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,540
But who'd believe that? I wouldn't.

454
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,160
So what happened?

455
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,470
It looked like they let it slide,

456
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,960
but they ended breaking up soon after.

457
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,030
I see.

458
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,650
Why would you tolerate that? She should've dumped him immediately.

459
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,540
She must've liked him that much.

460
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,600
Gosh, just thinking about it makes me feel disgusted.

461
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,520
Don't you agree?

462
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,360
Yes. Well...

463
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,580
I think I'd feel disgusted.

464
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,210
Aren't you dating anyone?

465
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,990
I heard you dated your ex for a long time.

466
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,710
Why did you break up?

467
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:18,020
Let's stop talking about these things at work.

468
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,300
Mr. Kim, you know you always give Ms. Han special treatment, right?

469
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,760
- Pardon? 
 - I didn't say anything unreasonable.

470
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,030
But you don't let us ask her anything.

471
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,290
- Ji Eun. 
 - Okay, okay.

472
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,000
My apologies.

473
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,020
I shouldn't have asked Ms. Han a private question.

474
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,780
I'll go to the restroom real quick.

475
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,530
Okay.

476
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,060
- Nuna. 
 - Hey.

477
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,700
Are you going home now?

478
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,950
Yes, what is it?

479
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,140
Well, the thing is...

480
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,670
I didn't want you to worry about what Ji Eun said during the meeting.

481
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,660
It's okay.

482
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,200
Did you run out to tell me that?

483
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,350
Well, yes.

484
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,630
What are you doing on Saturday?

485
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,450
Saturday?

486
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,680
Why?

487
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,000
Do you want to see me that day?

488
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:41,130
I have some musical tickets. I thought you'd like it.

489
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,140
Well, I have a plan that day.

490
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,740
What kind of plan is it?

491
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,880
What?

492
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,060
Can you push it back unless it's important?

493
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,250
Well, I'm sorry. It's important.

494
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,280
How about afterward? Why don't we meet after you're done?

495
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,110
Well...

496
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,970
I'm not sure what time I'd be done.

497
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,130
I'll wait until you're done.

498
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,390
You know, the CEO of...

499
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,040
Yes.

500
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,380
Aren't you going home, Mr. Kim?

501
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,230
I have a few more things to do.

502
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,060
I'll see you then.

503
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,210
See you.

504
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,030
 Make sure to call me afterward. 

505
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,080
I'm home.

506
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,710
Hello.

507
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,230
Hey. Are you eating?

508
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,070
You're a grown woman, but you can't even cook.

509
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,390
You're eating that because you don't want to cook, right?

510
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,650
- I'm not, okay? 
 - I don't think so.

511
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,600
It's obvious.

512
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,410
You don't know anything, Mom.

513
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,670
There...

514
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,470
What's this?

515
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,030
It's dinner. I didn't feel like cooking, either.

516
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,070
This is my dinner.

517
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,570
That's not a meal.

518
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,330
Are you sick or something?

519
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,570
No.

520
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,340
I don't feel that hungry tonight.

521
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,810
Hey, just eat.

522
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:12,960
I got two because I knew you'd be like this.

523
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,610
Okay, let's eat. Looks good.

524
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,360
Okay.

525
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,690
What are you doing?

526
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:49,200
I'll eat it tomorrow morning. I'm not that hungry now.

527
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,520
Do whatever you want.

528
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,800
I don't know what's going on with you.

529
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,130
I'll eat in my room, then.

530
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,060
   

531
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,800
   

532
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,800
   

533
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,250
 I'll start the film review. 

534
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,500
 A man and a woman are in a relationship that went stale. 

535
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,490
 The two try to erase memories of each other. 

536
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,630
 But the problem is they fell in love again 

537
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,730
 after erasing memories of each other. 

538
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,440
 They ask each other after reuniting. 

539
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,420
 "We won't be able to stand and get sick of each other again eventually." 

540
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,950
 "Do you still want to start over again?" 

541
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,980
 And they answer the question. 

542
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,860
 "It's okay, no matter what we end up facing." 

543
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,170
It won't be possible, right?

544
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,770
Anything is possible.

545
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,880
Did you come up with this design yourself?

546
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,090
How pretty.

547
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,050
No.

548
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,520
It's not my design.

549
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,160
Is it your girlfriend's, then?

550
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,810
Yes.

551
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,980
Those are the days.

552
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,990
Are you proposing to your girlfriend?

553
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:37,120
Time and women don't wait for you.

554
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,610
What's the use of regretting after they leave?

555
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,260
Make sure it's not too late, okay?

556
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,990
Okay.

557
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,840
 Saturday at three. Let's meet here. 

558
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,410
Hello?

559
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,520
Mom, did you take my lipstick from my room?

560
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,130
 Oh, that... 

561
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,260
 I think I brought it to the office and left it there. 

562
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,430
Why didn't you ask me first?

563
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,050
No, it's okay. Got it.

564
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,210
Is this better?

565
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,030
The blue one?

566
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,350
No, the dress shirt is better.

567
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,090
 I'm meeting Seong Ok. 

568
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,040
 I'm meeting Hyeon Seong. 

569
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:53,080
 But I can't sort out my head or heart. 

570
00:44:54,790 --> 00:45:00,240
 Are the qualities he liked in me still even there? 

571
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,560
 I feel like I'll finally stop feeling lost. 

572
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,180
 How should I start the conversation? 

573
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,910
 Would I even be able to make eye contact? 

574
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,880
 I'm nervous, 

575
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,290
 but I can't wait to see her. 

576
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,810
 I'll try to act natural. 

577
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:26,150
 Would I be able to act normal? 

578
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:25,820
♫  I feel like I'm in love  ♫

579
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:32,130
♫  I know it looks weird, but walk on the road singing ooh ~ ooh ~ooh ~  ♫

580
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:37,820
♫  I fall in love with you  ♫

581
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:43,990

582
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:50,030
♫  You asked me another day, "Will you love me forever?"  ♫

583
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:56,010
♫  And I said I'm not the type who can leave you, someone like you  ♫

584
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:59,130
♫  Summer and the winter comes and goes  ♫

585
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:02,120

588
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,610
Nuna.

589
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,790
Geon Yeop, what are you doing here?

590
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,630
I'm sorry.

591
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:43,170
I lied to you about something.

592
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:53,150
♫  From downpour to the rainbow  ♫ 
 ♫  Anything looks great  ♫

595

598
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:21,320
   

599
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:28,840
♫  I called you without realizing and bothered you  ♫

600
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:34,660
♫  But you let me be by your side  ♫

00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,460
♫  With a mischievous smile  ♫

602
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,710
 Let's meet at three tomorrow. 

603
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,610
 I'll be dressed in yellow. 

604
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,720
 Hi, Sally. 

605
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,330
 Who wants to hang out with me? 

606
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:47,420
 I'll leave if you don't come. 

607
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,150
 Hey... 

608
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:50,830
 What's with you? 

609
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:52,520
 Why are you going to sleep already? 

610
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,530
 Are you sure you're not sick? 

611
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,820
 Get out! 

612
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,910
 Why did you do that? 

613
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,630
 You always looked bored 

614
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,160
 and you didn't even make eye contact. 

615
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,180
 I wanted us to be more curious and think about each other more. 

616
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,500
 Was that really that hard? 

617
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,370
 What broke once is bound to break again. 

618
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:25,600
 Discard what's broken and move on to a new one. 

619
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,580
 The people from Jewelry A are here. 

620
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:30,760
♫  I promise you now  ♫

621
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,370
♫  Stay, stay  ♫

622
