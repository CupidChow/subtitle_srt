1
00:00:00,307 --> 00:00:02,557
   

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:13,780


3
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:21,687
Hello, Hyeong. Do you remember me? I'm her college hubae.

4
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:27,947
Yes. I know. It's been a while.

5
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:32,827
What's all this, by the way?

6
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:41,467
You know H2 uses good-quality fabric.

7
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:46,457
I thought people might notice it more if they saw it in person.

8
00:00:46,457 --> 00:00:49,107
I know. It'd help with promoting.

9
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:51,097
H2 does use nice fabric.

10
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:56,587
Yes. This is really cool. The designs are so nice, too.

11
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:08,787
Geon Yeop, could I ask you to get us some coffee?

12
00:01:08,787 --> 00:01:11,157
Sure, why don't I?

13
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:23,447
We'll have two Americanos.

14
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:25,417
Okay.

15
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:34,277
I haven't sold many since I just came out here.

16
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:36,917
I'm sure they'll sell soon.

17
00:01:39,187 --> 00:01:41,717
Isn't it tough?

18
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:44,447
No, not at all.

19
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:47,957
I'm learning stuff by being out here.

20
00:01:47,957 --> 00:01:49,817
It's nice.

21
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:54,987
I should've done this sooner.

22
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,927
I see.

23
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:06,587
I heard from Hyeong Seop that you're getting back to designing.

24
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,257
Yes, it worked out that way.

25
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:10,957
I see.

26
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:18,707
Are you working with him, then?

27
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:20,307
Huh?

28
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:23,337
Yes.

29
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:30,747
He seems like a cool guy.

30
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:33,217
Well...

31
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:39,527
are things going well between you two?

32
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:44,707
It's not like that.

33
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:47,557
He's just my college hubae.

34
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:51,837
Seong Ok, next timeâ€”

35
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:54,177
I got you coffee, Nuna.

36
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:57,687
Thank you.

37
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:03,747
I suppose you don't know. Seong Ok can't drink Americano.

38
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,187
Should I get you a vanilla latte?

39
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,167
It's okay. I'll go get you one.

40
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,107
No, it's okay.

41
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:17,247
Are you okay?

42
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:21,327
I'm really okay.

43
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:25,707
Shall we go now?

44
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:29,667
Okay. We'll get going now, then.

45
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,617
Oh, okay.

46
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,197
Seong Ok.

47
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:52,837
See you again.

48
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:02,457
Street fashion brand H2 is having a season sale.

49
00:04:09,137 --> 00:04:10,907
Street...

50
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:38,797
Gosh, why do people drink this?

51
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:42,947
What? Are you crying, too?

52
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:45,917
I'll make sure to add syrup next time.

53
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:50,117
It's okay. I didn't tell you.

54
00:04:59,737 --> 00:05:02,357
You're laughing at me because I can't drink Americano, right?

55
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:03,927
Yes.

56
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:05,827
I've never seen someone crying because of bitter coffee.

57
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:07,437
Hey.

58
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:10,477
We'll get there later than the moving truck. I'll hurry up.

59
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:22,637
   

60
00:06:07,017 --> 00:06:09,727
This won't even be close.

61
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:24,667
   

62
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:29,697
 Do you think I like working for someone else? 

63
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:32,787
 Why do you think I got a job, giving up on designing? 

64
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:34,027
 Don't you remember? 

65
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:39,527
 Or did you think it was only fair because you think you're superior? 

66
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,617
   

67
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:47,527
We see each other often.

68
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:49,947
It's nice to see you often.

69
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:51,647
Yes, I know.

70
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:56,897
Let's get straight to the point without an introduction since we see each other often.

71
00:06:56,897 --> 00:06:58,337
I heard from Myeong Jin.

72
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:01,657
But the conditions changed a bit since then.

73
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:04,557
- Pardon? 
 - We discussed H2 joining us,

74
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,867
but we got rejected.

75
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:08,307
It's hard for us as a company to take you back.

76
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:10,037
There's such a thing as a company system.

77
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:13,417
But I'm not that much of a cutthroat person

78
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:16,317
and Myeong Jin told me about your situation too.

79
00:07:16,317 --> 00:07:17,757
So I was thinking...

80
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:21,647
how about you just join Winders as our designer?

81
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:26,567
I have faith in your design abilities. Let's develop a new brand together.

82
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,677
As Winders' designer?

83
00:07:28,677 --> 00:07:31,687
Why? Does that hurt your pride too?

84
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:35,177
No, it's not that...

85
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:36,477
I haven't thought about it yet.

86
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:38,377
I'm not asking you a favor, either.

87
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:39,837
I'm giving you a chance.

88
00:07:39,837 --> 00:07:43,637
I know you had good taste and were talented when you were in school.

89
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:46,897
I know H2 was successful briefly too.

90
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:50,207
But you haven't proved anything for years.

91
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:56,277
To be honest, if I just got your resume without knowing you personally,

92
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:58,887
this position would be difficult for you to come by.

93
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:03,347
I don't know what to say if you still don't want to.

94
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:05,177
I'll do it.

95
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:07,177
Really?

96
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:08,727
Yes.

97
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:10,887
I'll work really hard.

98
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:12,727
Hey, you made the right decision.

99
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:14,167
I'm not an uptight person.

100
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,387
I'll promote you quickly if you're competent.

101
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:18,867
The beginning is important. Just look at Myeong Jin.

102
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:22,067
- I'm glad you're doing this, Hyeong. 
 - Yes, thank you.

103
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,877
Okay. Good, good, good.

104
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:26,897
All right. Let's make this work.

105
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:28,690
Yes!

106
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:37,577
- Hello. 
  - Hello. 

107
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:39,497
This way, Nuna.

108
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:48,777
   

109
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,017
Do you like it?

110
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:53,677
Yes.

111
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:03,157
Let me know anytime if you have a question.

112
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:06,427
This is your desk.

113
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:10,337
They'll set everything up for you.

114
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:12,937
Then, I can sit here, right?

115
00:09:12,937 --> 00:09:15,447
Yes. Fighting.

116
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:26,397
 The first few days since we broke up felt like a lie. 

117
00:09:28,097 --> 00:09:31,867
 And I did nothing but cry for a few days afterward. 

118
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,167
 Okay, cheers. 

119
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:38,517
 - Cheers, cheers, cheers. 
 - I drank almost every day 

120
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:40,837
 and badmouthed you to my friends, too. 

121
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:42,397
 Be honest with me. 

122
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:45,597
 Was I so wrong? Huh? 

123
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:47,717
 Am I the only one in the wrong? 

124
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:54,867
 Hyeong Seop, can't you become disappointed or upset if you date someone for seven years? 

125
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:57,507
 I guess I thought that'd make me feel better. 

126
00:09:57,507 --> 00:10:00,997
 I've done a lot for her, too. Geez, seriously... 

127
00:10:00,997 --> 00:10:05,307
 But I started blaming the situation more instead 

128
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:09,887
 and I started escaping from reality. 

129
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:12,827
 But after repeating many days like that, 

130
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:20,277
 I quit drinking to achieve my goal 

131
00:10:20,277 --> 00:10:23,157
 and started focusing on nothing but work. 

132
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:29,227
 And suddenly, I thought, maybe things aren't so bad. 

133
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:31,957
 And then... 

134
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:37,247
 I stopped having trouble sleeping. 

135
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:53,647
 Wake up, Seong Ok. Wake up. 

136
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:54,867
 Give me five more minutes. 

137
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:56,707
 No way! Get up now. 

138
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:59,087
 We'll miss our train otherwise, okay? 

139
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:01,467
 Get up now. Hurry. 

140
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:03,597
 If you don't get up, 

141
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,477
 I'll tickle you. 

142
00:11:05,477 --> 00:11:07,387
 - Don't do it. Don't do it. 
 - Get up right now. 

143
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:10,327
 - Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up. 
 - Stop that. 

144
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:14,247
 Stop it. Stop it. Come on. 

145
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:15,787
 You're unbelievable. 

146
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:19,317
â™«  We're on different paths  â™«

147
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:21,227
 Let's eat quickly and get going. 

148
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:25,477
â™«  We've come away too far  â™«

149
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,007
 - Did you make curry? 
 - Yes. 

150
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:29,017
 - Sounds good. 
 - Let's eat. 

151
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:31,987
 Come here. 

152
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:38,207
 Seriously. Let's go. 

153
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:52,067
So annoying.

154
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:10,077
 It's been three months since we broke up. 

155
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:15,677
 I still dream about you 

156
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:21,697
 and it still hasn't hit me. 

157
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:50,677
 Stop saying you're tired all the time. 

158
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:54,417
 I made you curry. Have it for breakfast. 

159
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,487
   

160
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:07,607
 Hey, Geon Yeop. 

161
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:09,367
I need to pick up some replacement material.

162
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,757
 Isn't it too much trouble for you? 

163
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:16,827
No, it bothered me from the beginning, and I'm just not happy with it.

164
00:13:16,827 --> 00:13:19,307
I'll be back in time. Don't worry.

165
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:21,687
 I'm not worried about that. Get back safely. 

166
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:23,647
Okay.

167
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:54,957
 Would I be able to forget that day? 

168
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:58,997
 If I get back together with Hyeon Seong, 

169
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:04,337
 would I be able to go back as if nothing happened? 

170
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:10,687
 I don't think that'd be possible. 

171
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:21,487
Step on it. Step on it.

172
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:23,787
Nice.

173
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:27,117
Hey, hey, hey, you bastard. Hey!

174
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,297
Shit.

175
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:32,567
You scared me.

176
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,007
What's going on, Hyeong?

177
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,077
You wanted to see me.

178
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:41,527
Yes, you're right.

179
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:43,907
What did you want to see me for?

180
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:47,127
I was just wondering if things were going well.

181
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:49,127
I wanted to discuss your design.

182
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:51,577
I uploaded the file.

183
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:03,807
Hyeong,

184
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:06,577
do you still think you're an artist?

185
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:09,037
- What? 
 - It's a bit too abstract.

186
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:11,517
It's not appealing to the masses, either.

187
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:15,767
You failed at a brand. You can't keep doing what you did then.

188
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,847
You wanted something more unique last time.

189
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:23,607
Is this how you interpreted that?

190
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:27,347
I wanted something unique, not abstract.

191
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:32,777
We're not spending money to design stuff to sell to a few hardcore fans.

192
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:35,197
You're right. I'll be more careful.

193
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:38,187
Yes, let's make it work.

194
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:41,557
Right. You're coming to the design team dinner tonight, right?

195
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:43,597
Well, I quit drinking.

196
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:46,567
We're having a dinner to welcome you.

197
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:49,227
Stuff like this is important in work life.

198
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:52,747
Yes. Okay. I'll be there.

199
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:54,607
You can leave.

200
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,467
He's annoyingly good.

201
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:31,087
Who said you can delete that?

202
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:33,617
All of that is the company's asset.

203
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,147
Well, I wanted to start over.

204
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:38,337
Open it.

205
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:41,227
- Pardon? 
 - Open it, I said.

206
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,767
Okay.

207
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:55,077
Let's talk for a second.

208
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,817
So pretty.

209
00:17:00,377 --> 00:17:03,137
Just like that. That's great.

210
00:17:03,137 --> 00:17:05,547
Gosh, so pretty.

211
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:10,237
You look so pretty now. My gosh, so pretty.

212
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,617
Okay. Cut.

213
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:15,717
- Shall we take a look? 
 - Yes.

214
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:23,207
Okay, good. Good.

215
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,147
Stop.

216
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:29,667
Team Leader Han changed the earrings, right?

217
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:32,147
Yes.

218
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:35,577
I love it.

219
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:39,527
Right? Team Leader Han has amazing taste.

220
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:43,267
Yes, our company doesn't function without her.

221
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:46,437
It's thanks to the great photographer and the model who made them shine.

222
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:47,517
Not at all.

223
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:52,217
Let's say it's thanks to the photographer's skills and Team Leader Han's taste.

224
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:54,827
- We need to include the model, too. 
 - My gosh.

225
00:17:54,827 --> 00:17:56,867
- Shall we eat? 
 - Yes.

226
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,767
Let's eat.

227
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:01,267
- Good work. 
 - Sure.

228
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:03,607
They came out so nicely.

229
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:05,937
Isn't the jewelry so pretty?

230
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:09,217
- You made them look good. 
 - My goodness...

231
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:15,507
You should take a break.

232
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:17,567
This is a break.

233
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,807
Okay. I'll be in the waiting room. Come and get me.

234
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,017
Okay. Take a rest.

235
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,157
- Seong Ok. 
 - Yes?

236
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:29,337
You're so cool.

237
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:36,837
What?

238
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:14,607
- Hello? 
  - Yes, this is Chowon Photo Studio. 

239
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:16,527
Chowon?

240
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:19,017
I don't have a delivery for you.

241
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:23,557
 No, it's not that. You used to come here often to develop films. 

242
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:26,287
Oh, right.

243
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:29,837
 Yes. We'll be closing permanently soon. 

244
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,757
 So we're getting rid of developed rolls now. 

245
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:35,847
 There's a roll you haven't picked up. 

246
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:37,847
 Hello? Hello? 

247
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:39,887
Please throw that away.

248
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,447
I don't need it anymore.

249
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:45,417
Okay.

250
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:06,967
Food delivery.

251
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:08,677
I'll go get it.

252
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:10,357
Yes.

253
00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:15,017
An Si Hu.

254
00:20:15,017 --> 00:20:16,907
Han Seong Ok.

255
00:20:19,447 --> 00:20:20,917
- I'll take them. 
 - Okay.

256
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:22,767
Thank you.

257
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:25,527
Wow, it's been forever.

258
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:28,397
I know. It's been so long.

259
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,077
You're doing well, right?

260
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:32,760
You know, the same as usual.

261
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,037
Wow, this is cool.

262
00:20:36,587 --> 00:20:37,717
You became successful.

263
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:39,397
Successful, my foot.

264
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:41,257
Eun Jeong is inside, too. Do you want to say hi?

265
00:20:41,257 --> 00:20:43,577
Gosh, the deliveries backed up.

266
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,047
It's all right. I saw her recently.

267
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:48,417
- I'll get going. 
 - Oh, okay.

268
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:54,107
Let's hang out next time when you're free. We'll grab a drink.

269
00:20:55,057 --> 00:20:57,027
Okay, let's do that.

270
00:20:57,027 --> 00:20:59,507
- I'll be in touch. 
 - Okay.

271
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:10,027
- Do you know him? 
 - Huh?

272
00:21:10,027 --> 00:21:11,627
Yes.

273
00:21:11,627 --> 00:21:13,707
He's a friend.

274
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,397
A very close friend.

275
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:23,357
 I just ran into a friend who observed Hyeon Seong and me together all along. 

276
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:27,327
 But I was happy to see him as if I saw Hyeon Seong. 

277
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:42,427
   

278
00:21:51,597 --> 00:21:59,597
   

279
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,557
Yes, it's all done.

280
00:22:18,557 --> 00:22:21,027
This is the last film we'll be developing here.

281
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:22,977
Take a look.

282
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:47,557
â™«  I think of you every time I take a step  â™«

283
00:22:49,027 --> 00:22:54,547
â™«  I keep slowing down  â™«

284
00:22:56,017 --> 00:23:01,977
â™«  With my loose shoelaces  â™«

285
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:10,957
â™«  I stare at the sky that changed me  â™«

286
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:19,977
â™«  Slowly, a little slowly, would you get further away from me?  â™«

287
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:27,087
â™«  So, we could remember our old laughter  â™«

288
00:23:27,087 --> 00:23:33,807
â™«  A little, just for a little bit, I'll leave it here  â™«

289
00:23:33,807 --> 00:23:43,007
â™«  So I could leave after crying even if we break up  â™«

290
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:47,477
 I thought only I was looking at her. 

291
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:50,347
 But... 

292
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:55,317
 she was also looking at me. 

293
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,447
Is the work manageable?

294
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,997
Has Myeong Jin been pressuring you at all?

295
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,607
Well, it's been okay.

296
00:24:13,607 --> 00:24:14,817
Okay, my foot.

297
00:24:14,817 --> 00:24:17,417
I'm glad Myeong Jin was my hubae.

298
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:21,647
I don't even want to think about him as my sunbae.

299
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:25,297
But why did you suddenly...

300
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,837
I'm thinking of giving you a separate project. What do you think?

301
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:30,897
Project?

302
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:34,767
Yes. We'll do a photo shoot with a jewelry company soon.

303
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:38,067
I need someone to be in charge of it, and I think you're perfect for it.

304
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:39,957
You have experience in jewelry design, too.

305
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:41,737
Well...

306
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:43,837
- That'sâ€” 
 - I know.

307
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:45,727
I heard you ran a business with your girlfriend and broke up.

308
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:49,017
When will you work on your project if you worry about everything?

309
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:51,277
It'd be your loss if you don't do it.

310
00:24:51,877 --> 00:24:53,987
You're right.

311
00:24:53,987 --> 00:24:55,597
That means you'll do it, right?

312
00:24:55,597 --> 00:24:57,837
This is an opportunity, too. Make it work while you can.

313
00:24:57,837 --> 00:25:00,017
I'll let you know when it's confirmed.

314
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:01,477
Okay, got it.

315
00:25:01,477 --> 00:25:04,747
Wait, you haven't had lunch, have you?

316
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:13,917
 Oppa. 

317
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:15,887
 - Huh? 
 - I'm sleepy. 

318
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:17,297
 I want to go to sleep. 

319
00:25:17,297 --> 00:25:19,307
 Okay, I'll get you a taxi. Let's go. 

320
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:21,617
 No. 

321
00:25:21,617 --> 00:25:24,117
 With you. 

322
00:25:29,377 --> 00:25:31,517
Hello.

323
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:45,837
What are you doing?

324
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:47,957
Yes, right.

325
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:57,747
Princess.

326
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:01,287
Thank you so much for today.

327
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:04,797
Not at all. I should be thanking you.

328
00:26:06,277 --> 00:26:08,577
Oh, Si Hu came to deliver food today. Isn't that crazy?

329
00:26:08,577 --> 00:26:10,107
- An Si Hu did? 
 - Yes.

330
00:26:10,107 --> 00:26:12,647
That is kind of crazy.

331
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:16,627
You're not thinking of Hyeon Seong because of that, right?

332
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:19,587
Geez, I'm just saying it was nice to see him.

333
00:26:19,587 --> 00:26:21,687
That's a relief, then.

334
00:26:22,787 --> 00:26:26,077
Hey, the employee who was attached to you...

335
00:26:26,077 --> 00:26:28,167
is the hubae you mentioned before, right?

336
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,787
Geon Yeop?

337
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:32,437
He likes you.

338
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:35,487
It's not like that. He's just good to me because he's my hubae.

339
00:26:35,487 --> 00:26:38,357
Are you playing ignorant or enjoying it?

340
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:40,847
Can't you tell by just looking at his eyes?

341
00:26:40,847 --> 00:26:43,477
He was totally into you.

342
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,327
What? Do you not like him?

343
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:46,857
Is his personality no good?

344
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:48,857
No. He's really nice.

345
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,357
I knew it. He's nice-looking, too.

346
00:26:51,357 --> 00:26:54,167
Hey, what's the problem?

347
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:56,117
It's not like that. He's...

348
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:57,707
He's just my hubae.

349
00:26:57,707 --> 00:27:02,717
And I can't imagine seeing someone else yet.

350
00:27:02,717 --> 00:27:07,727
Starting a relationship with someone else feels impossible and uncomfortable.

351
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:11,357
You haven't gotten over Jeong Hyeon Seong yet.

352
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:16,597
I mean...

353
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:20,947
I keep remembering how irritable I was.

354
00:27:20,947 --> 00:27:23,967
Thinking now, I shouldn't have been so irritated about those things.

355
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:27,867
He wasn't exactly a saint, either. People aren't that different.

356
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:29,747
I know.

357
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:31,627
It's strange.

358
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:34,877
I think I was disappointed about a lot of things,

359
00:27:34,877 --> 00:27:36,867
but I only remember the good times now.

360
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:40,087
You keep romanticizing your memory.

361
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:45,247
Stop thinking about the good and force yourself to think about the bad.

362
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:49,437
Write them down and read them twice daily, in the morning and at night.

363
00:27:49,437 --> 00:27:52,717
And delete photos if you're keeping any.

364
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:56,727
Okay. I'll try.

365
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:01,407
Thank you for today.

366
00:28:01,407 --> 00:28:03,467
Thank you.

367
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:04,957
You worked so hard today, Nuna.

368
00:28:04,957 --> 00:28:07,217
No, you did more than me.

369
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:09,127
You did so much today, too, Eun Jeong.

370
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:11,287
No, not at all.

371
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:14,937
Should we get dinner together if you'd like?

372
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:17,807
Would you be free for dinner?

373
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:20,617
Do you really want me to come?

374
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,287
I have a plan.

375
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:24,627
Please take good care of Seong Ok.

376
00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:25,987
Okay.

377
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:29,047
I'll eat at home tonight, too, then.

378
00:28:29,047 --> 00:28:31,437
My mom is upset that I keep coming home late.

379
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:33,667
Oh, okay.

380
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:36,457
Please finish cleaning up the set. I'll be right out after cleaning up in here.

381
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:39,577
Okay. Let's meet in the front afterward. I'll drive you home.

382
00:28:39,577 --> 00:28:41,087
Okay.

383
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:43,657
- Thank you. 
 - Take care.

384
00:28:44,407 --> 00:28:46,807
- What's wrong with you? 
 - Please, don't do that.

385
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:49,477
Suggest getting something tasty together.

386
00:29:01,477 --> 00:29:03,617
Hold on a second.

387
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,807
Even the way you eat is so pathetic. Seriously.

388
00:29:14,807 --> 00:29:17,987
You almost hurt my feelings,

389
00:29:17,987 --> 00:29:21,017
but I'm fine, since you're worse than me.

390
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:23,697
Based on what standard?

391
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:26,117
I'm not a forever single like you.

392
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:29,887
Since people tend to like my face,

393
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:32,387
I've been able to flirt.

394
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:35,017
Women hate fat men, okay?

395
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:37,437
They probably hate short men more.

396
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:40,217
Do you want to see who's more popular?

397
00:29:41,177 --> 00:29:43,027
Should we?

398
00:29:43,027 --> 00:29:44,497
Bring it on.

399
00:29:44,497 --> 00:29:47,737
- Should I? 
 - Go ahead.

400
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:51,557
- Should I? 
 - Go ahead!

401
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:58,037
   

402
00:30:08,087 --> 00:30:09,667
Does blood circulate in your head?

403
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:12,007
What's with your pants? Did you poop in them?

404
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:14,957
What would a forever single know?

405
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:19,007
This is what they call E.S., you dummy.

406
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:21,347
E-E what?

407
00:30:21,347 --> 00:30:24,537
You don't even know basic stuff like this. Geez.

408
00:30:24,537 --> 00:30:27,617
Effortless Style. It looks effortless even though you put effort into it.

409
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:32,067
But you obviously put way too much effort.

410
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:34,547
Women feel uncomfortable with a style like that.

411
00:30:34,547 --> 00:30:38,367
You don't even know the basics. How will you even compete?

412
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,417
The loser pays for everything tonight, okay?

413
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:43,647
I knew it. That's why I didn't bring my wallet.

414
00:30:44,597 --> 00:30:46,297
Let's go.

415
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,367
This place is like the animal kingdom.

416
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:17,427
- Are you nervous? 
 - Nervous?

417
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:19,327
Hey, why...

418
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:24,797
Just watch me and do exactly as I do.

419
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:50,387
An autograph, please.

420
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:51,927
Pardon?

421
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:57,027
You're... You're not a celebrity. Gosh.

422
00:31:57,027 --> 00:32:00,647
I thought you were a celebrity since you're so pretty.

423
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:06,027
I was wondering if you could give me your phone number or a messaging app ID rather than an autograph.

424
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:07,677
- I see... 
 - Yes.

425
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:10,407
I don't have a phone.

426
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:12,317
Oh, you don't...

427
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:14,487
You don't have a phone.

428
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:19,947
Would you like to drink with me?

429
00:32:21,887 --> 00:32:24,777
Or we can go somewhere nice...

430
00:32:25,617 --> 00:32:30,207
I'm not interested, so go away.

431
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:32,467
Thank you.

432
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:34,947
S-Sashimi. I like sashimi, too.

433
00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:40,697
Hey, hey. I can't speak Korean, okay?

434
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,687
Not Korean.

435
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:44,557
You know?

436
00:32:58,097 --> 00:32:59,997
- Really? 
 - What do you like?

437
00:32:59,997 --> 00:33:01,547
I like gopchang.

438
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,367
- Gopchang? 
 - Yes.

439
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,617
I know a really good place.

440
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,147
It's on me.

441
00:33:07,147 --> 00:33:09,397
- Really? My gosh. 
 - Yeah.

442
00:33:09,397 --> 00:33:11,527
E.S. or whatever.

443
00:33:11,527 --> 00:33:14,107
Our faces are the problems.

444
00:33:14,107 --> 00:33:16,087
It's because I came here with you.

445
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:18,207
What about me?

446
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:36,877
What?

447
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:38,897
Oh Fatty?

448
00:33:56,287 --> 00:33:57,557
   

449
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:02,267
You scared me. What is it?

450
00:34:05,707 --> 00:34:07,407
Hello?

451
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:10,087
 Oh Fatty, where are you? 

452
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:11,877
I...

453
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:17,137
- I... I'm at home. I'm at home. 
  - I see... 

454
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:19,407
Why is it so loud at your place?

455
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:24,677
I'm playing music kind of loudly at home.

456
00:34:24,677 --> 00:34:26,877
I think that's why. By the way, what's up?

457
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:30,537
 I wanted to see you briefly if you were out. 

458
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:31,937
 But don't worry if you're home. 

459
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:35,897
 - I'll hang up. 
- Hye Ryeong, don't hang up. Hey, Kim Hye Ryeong. Hey!

460
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:40,457
Why did I say I was home?

461
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:43,427
What? Was that your middle school classmate?

462
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:45,767
This is your fault!

463
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:49,047
Why do you keep blaming me?

464
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:56,457
 Live pig cam. Is this your home? 

465
00:35:05,757 --> 00:35:07,547
Shit.

466
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:10,337
Hey, where are you going?

467
00:35:27,217 --> 00:35:29,087
Hey, Geon Yeop, are you not done yet?

468
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:31,527
 I'm coming out now. Sorry for making you wait. 

469
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:33,957
No, you don't have to apologize.

470
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:36,677
Should I help you if there's still a lot to clean up?

471
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,017
 Turn around. 

472
00:35:38,017 --> 00:35:39,677
What?

473
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:48,497
Take this.

474
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:55,367
I thought it'd be a shame to throw them away.

475
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:07,997
That man earlier is Hyeon Seong's friend, right?

476
00:36:10,347 --> 00:36:13,547
Yes, how did you know?

477
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,397
I just had a feeling.

478
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:22,537
Do you still think of him?

479
00:36:27,337 --> 00:36:29,117
Yes.

480
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:33,547
Why wouldn't you? You dated him for a long time.

481
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:36,447
Oh, no.

482
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:39,007
I really need to move on now.

483
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:46,827
Enjoy.

484
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:47,947
Thank you.

485
00:36:47,947 --> 00:36:49,567
Thank you.

486
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:54,427
Wow, thanks to the welcoming party for Hyeon Seong, we get to eat beef.

487
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:57,007
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

488
00:36:57,007 --> 00:37:00,697
Huh? Yes, yes.

489
00:37:04,227 --> 00:37:06,167
- What is it? 
 - Pardon?

490
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:08,897
Do you know her?

491
00:37:08,897 --> 00:37:11,217
No, I don't.

492
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:12,937
What did you talk about with Jun Beom earlier?

493
00:37:12,937 --> 00:37:16,067
He was just asking if I find work doable.

494
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,967
Why would he ask that now?

495
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:21,367
- You weren't talking behind my back? 
 - Why would we do that?

496
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:27,167
We're all here. I feel uncomfortable with the way you talk to him.

497
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,607
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

498
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:35,017
Come on. You're making things awkward.

499
00:37:35,017 --> 00:37:37,347
My glass is empty.

500
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,197
I'll pour you some.

501
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:45,937
I'll pour you some, Sir.

502
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:55,147
I couldn't even share a table with you when we were in school.

503
00:37:55,147 --> 00:38:00,597
I feel so successful since you're pouring me a drink.

504
00:38:00,597 --> 00:38:02,607
By the way, why aren't you drinking?

505
00:38:02,607 --> 00:38:05,577
Is it because you don't want to drink with me?

506
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:07,167
No, I've been trying toâ€”

507
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:10,867
Have a glass if that's not why. I want to pour you some, too.

508
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:16,387
Okay, then.

509
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:32,867
You're a good drinker, Hyeon Seong.

510
00:38:33,497 --> 00:38:35,637
I'm sorry. I meant, Hyeong.

511
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:37,757
Do you know what he was like?

512
00:38:37,757 --> 00:38:41,447
He rarely came to class sober.

513
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:45,227
He was basically drunk the whole time he was in school.

514
00:38:45,227 --> 00:38:47,407
You can hold your liquor.

515
00:38:48,907 --> 00:38:50,827
Have some.

516
00:39:01,057 --> 00:39:03,427
Let's have another round.

517
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:07,767
You're drunk. You should leave.

518
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:09,047
See you in the office.

519
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,687
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Okay.

520
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:15,787
- Bye. 
 - Take care. Bye now.

521
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:25,867
 The more drunk I am, 

522
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:28,747
 the more everything else looks blurry 

523
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:33,537
 and the clearer Seong Ok's face gets. 

524
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:38,227
- Get home safely. 
 - I can go from here.

525
00:39:38,227 --> 00:39:40,327
Take care.

526
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:42,857
See you.

527
00:39:48,187 --> 00:39:52,097
I got a taxi. Why isn't it coming?

528
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:08,267
- Did you do something wrong? 
 - Pardon?

529
00:40:09,347 --> 00:40:10,427
No, it's not thatâ€”

530
00:40:10,427 --> 00:40:12,687
I'll get in first.

531
00:40:13,437 --> 00:40:16,457
I'll get another one...

532
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:18,187
How funny.

533
00:40:18,797 --> 00:40:21,367
I'll forget about what happened that time.

534
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:25,607
Let's keep pretending we don't know each other.

535
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,967
Okay, let's do that.

536
00:40:53,137 --> 00:40:56,797
 Because of a passing relationship like this, I... 

537
00:41:02,507 --> 00:41:09,337
â™«  The streets without you look so empty  â™«

538
00:41:09,337 --> 00:41:16,227
â™«  The room without you looks too cold  â™«

539
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:22,337
â™«  Without you, I look so lonely  â™«

540
00:41:22,337 --> 00:41:25,567
â™«  I'm drinking again today  â™«

541
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,977
â™«  I'm drinking again today  â™«

542
00:41:27,977 --> 00:41:31,817
 Why do I feel so jealous and angry? 

543
00:41:31,817 --> 00:41:34,237
 I got you coffee, Nuna. 

544
00:41:34,237 --> 00:41:36,057
 Thank you. 

545
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:39,607
â™«  At which point did we  â™«

546
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:42,047
 We're already broken up. 

547
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:44,847
 I know I have nothing to say, 

548
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:47,907
 but it keeps bothering me. 

549
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:51,577
 This is why I didn't want to drink. 

550
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:56,237
 My head is spinning, and my emotions are getting intense. 

551
00:41:56,237 --> 00:41:59,847
 And I keep thinking about Seong Ok more. 

552
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:03,257
â™«  A stupid romance like this  â™«

553
00:42:03,257 --> 00:42:07,037
â™«  A stupid breakup like this  â™«

554
00:42:07,037 --> 00:42:10,507
â™«  Like a candle on the water  â™«

555
00:42:10,507 --> 00:42:13,987
â™«  Just like a candle on the water  â™«

556
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:16,457
â™«  I trusted no one but you  â™«

557
00:42:16,457 --> 00:42:18,717
 I should've held onto her then. 

558
00:42:19,397 --> 00:42:20,827
 I think we came too far. 

559
00:42:20,827 --> 00:42:23,827
â™«  Like a candle on the water  â™«

560
00:42:23,827 --> 00:42:25,117
 Be well. 

561
00:42:25,117 --> 00:42:28,800
â™«  Candle on the water  â™«

562
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:33,897
 If only I knew you meant so much to me, 

563
00:42:34,537 --> 00:42:36,187
 I would've tried harder to stop you. 

564
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:41,527
â™«  Nothing means to me without you  â™«

565
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:48,237
 Is it too late to go back now? 

566
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:52,107
â™«  Like candle on the water  â™«

567
00:42:52,107 --> 00:42:54,217
 Yes. 

568
00:42:54,217 --> 00:42:56,607
 I know this is so embarrassing, 

569
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,457
 but I'll borrow drunken courage and... 

570
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:05,267
â™«  Like candle on the water  â™«

571
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:11,377
â™«  Just like candle on the water  â™«

572
00:43:31,757 --> 00:43:34,287
Why does it taste so bitter today?

573
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,907
Geez!

574
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:41,147
Soju is bitter. Did you think it was sweet?

575
00:43:41,147 --> 00:43:43,877
Gosh, it hurts.

576
00:43:43,877 --> 00:43:46,057
- Seriously! 
 - Hey, it hurts.

577
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:49,937
Who taught you how to drink like that?

578
00:43:50,777 --> 00:43:54,167
This is my first time drinking like this. I mean it.

579
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:58,167
- You wanted to move out to do this, didn't you? 
 - No, I didn't.

580
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:01,187
Eat something while you drink, at least.

581
00:44:01,187 --> 00:44:04,347
- You don't even know. 
 - Seriously.

582
00:44:04,347 --> 00:44:07,007
Her slaps are so painful. Seriously.

583
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:17,187
How pretty.

584
00:44:52,847 --> 00:44:57,097
 Only focus on the things I didn't like. Things I didn't like. 

585
00:45:02,737 --> 00:45:08,197
 Yes. To be honest, no girlfriend in the world puts a blanket on the boyfriend 

586
00:45:08,197 --> 00:45:11,757
 who fell asleep after only lasting a few minutes. 

587
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:15,177
 Hey. 

588
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,587
 What? 

589
00:45:29,587 --> 00:45:32,227
 What are you doing? Why aren't you sleeping? 

590
00:45:32,227 --> 00:45:34,707
 I'll tickle you if you aren't sleeping. 

591
00:45:34,707 --> 00:45:37,227
 Don't do it. Don't do it. 

592
00:45:37,227 --> 00:45:38,547
 You started first. 

593
00:45:38,547 --> 00:45:41,737
 - I didn't do it. 
 - Why aren't you sleeping? 

594
00:45:44,337 --> 00:45:46,327
 Think about that hair, for example. 

595
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:50,007
 - No woman in the world likes messy hair like that. 
 - Ta-da! 

596
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:53,707
 I told him to cut it nice and short many times, but he never listened. 

597
00:45:58,427 --> 00:46:00,687
 So cute! 

598
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:11,307
 He made dad jokes, and he was childish. 

599
00:46:11,307 --> 00:46:14,367
 He cared more about soccer games than his girlfriend. 

600
00:46:15,297 --> 00:46:18,047
 Goal! Wow! 

601
00:46:18,047 --> 00:46:21,147
 Goal! Goal! Goal! 

602
00:46:21,147 --> 00:46:23,367
 It's a goal. Goal! 

603
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:26,147
 Wow, how... How did they score like that? 

604
00:46:26,147 --> 00:46:27,787
 - You need to do this. Do this. 
 - Do what? 

605
00:46:27,787 --> 00:46:30,917
 Do this, do this. Hurry. You need to. 

606
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,340
   

607
00:46:53,347 --> 00:46:56,187
I was going to write down the things I didn't like.

608
00:47:00,997 --> 00:47:02,947
So annoying.

609
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:09,097
This is no good. Let's delete the photos first.

610
00:47:17,477 --> 00:47:19,607
Why are there so many?

611
00:47:37,477 --> 00:47:40,017
Why are there so many?

612
00:47:42,507 --> 00:47:45,827
 We really liked each other, didn't we? 

613
00:47:46,987 --> 00:47:50,057
 We were sure about each other. 

614
00:47:52,507 --> 00:47:56,847
 I remember even the conversations we had, too. 

615
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:00,037
 What's this? It's so pretty. 

616
00:48:00,037 --> 00:48:04,047
 I'll get you one every anniversary. 

617
00:48:17,517 --> 00:48:19,857
   

618
00:48:25,297 --> 00:48:28,057
   

619
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:34,827
   

620
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,887
   

621
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:55,387
   

622
00:49:01,287 --> 00:49:05,637
   

623
00:49:26,347 --> 00:49:30,107
Crazy bastard. Why did you drink?

624
00:49:43,587 --> 00:49:47,757
Geez, I'll no longer drink, you losers.

625
00:49:52,577 --> 00:49:57,547
   

626
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:08,830


627
00:50:10,987 --> 00:50:12,817
   

628
00:50:12,817 --> 00:50:18,697
â™«  Looking back,  â™« 
 â™«  whenever I feel tired  â™«

629
00:50:18,697 --> 00:50:23,387
â™«  Unconsciously, I'd call you  â™« 
 â™«  and I regret for hurting you  â™«

630
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:29,247
â™«  But you let me be by your side  â™«

631
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,777
â™«  With a mischievous smile  â™«

632
00:50:31,777 --> 00:50:36,387
 I never get back together with someone I've broken up with. 

633
00:50:36,387 --> 00:50:39,267
 You would've been more attentive if you cared? 

634
00:50:39,267 --> 00:50:42,097
 I've been curious for the last six years. 

635
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:45,127
 Why did you do that to me? 

636
00:50:45,127 --> 00:50:47,387
 Why did you do that? 

637
00:50:47,387 --> 00:50:53,677
 I'm saying you need to let him go completely to meet someone nice. 

638
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:57,047
 What? 

639
00:50:57,047 --> 00:51:00,907
 How come you're so smart about other people's relationships? 

640
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:04,017
 Make sure you don't regret seeing Jeong Hyeon Seong. 

641
00:51:04,017 --> 00:51:06,267
 This is where a diamond will be. 

642
00:51:06,267 --> 00:51:08,177
 It might be difficult now, 

643
00:51:08,177 --> 00:51:10,947
 but let's make sure to connect it when we get married someday. 

644
00:51:10,947 --> 00:51:14,547
 Make the gap bigger. I'll put a diamond as big as your face in it. 

645
00:51:14,547 --> 00:51:16,477
 Are you proposing to your girlfriend? 

646
00:51:16,477 --> 00:51:19,197
 Time and women don't wait for you. 

647
00:51:19,197 --> 00:51:20,887
 Make sure it's not too late. 

648
00:51:20,887 --> 00:51:24,107
 Saturday at three. Let's meet here. 

649
00:51:25,327 --> 00:51:27,927
