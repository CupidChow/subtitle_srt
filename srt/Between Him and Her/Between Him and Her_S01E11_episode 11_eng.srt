1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,480
   

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:18,760


3
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,940
Shit...

4
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,480
Excuse me.

5
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,650
What are you doing?

6
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,430
I'm sorry. By chance...

7
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,100
is anyone from the film crew still in there?

8
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,460
They all left. Don't you know what time it is?

9
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,680
It's late. Please leave.

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,120
Why would you kick the gate?

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,410
You waited a long time, didn't you?

12
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,250
I'm sorry. I got off work a bit late.

13
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,120
Why did you come?

14
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,230
You shouldn't have come.

15
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,740
What?

16
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,360
If you didn't come,

17
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,190
I could've just left without regrets.

18
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,260
What do you mean by that?

19
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,050
Seong Ok.

20
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,490
Let's talk.

21
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't you know why I joined Winders?

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,520
It was because I wanted to prove to you that I changed.

23
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,560
I know.

24
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,840
That's why I waited.

25
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,370
But you came too late.

26
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,050
I said I had to work.

27
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,290
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,430
I wasn't getting angry.

29
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,440
I felt like leaving was the right thing to do,

30
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,450
but I thought I should see you today.

31
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,710
I...

32
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,450
went to the café that day.

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,410
But why...

34
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,900
I'm not sure why, but...

35
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,040
I was scared to sit in front of you.

36
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,880
I saw you sitting slouching down at the café.

37
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,590
The Hyeon Seong, I liked, was cool and radiant.

38
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,450
But I wondered why you looked so defeated waiting for me.

39
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,080
You refused to have H2 join Winders because of me.

40
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,180
It wasn't because of you.

41
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,170
H2 is meaningless without both of us.

42
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,230
That's why.

43
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,380
Yes, right.

44
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,950
Our H2.

45
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,880
I even gave up on designing for the future of H2.

46
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,770
But I started wondering why I was working at an office

47
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,860
and I wasn't sure what I meant to you, either.

48
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,430
I...

49
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,730
couldn't even say what I wanted because you've been struggling.

50
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,410
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,830
I should've...

52
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,140
noticed that sooner.

53
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,950
I know. Why couldn't you notice sooner?

54
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,290
I waited for so long. Back then...

55
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,150
and today, too.

56
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,650
I will...

57
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,700
Going forward...

58
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,320
I'll be so much better.

59
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,250
No.

60
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,600
I no longer want to wait.

61
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,460
Hyeon Seong,

62
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,280
do you only remember the good times?

63
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,950
To be honest, I remember the bad times a lot more.

64
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,010
This is futile.

65
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,590
To keep talking won't improve anything.

66
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,740
Han Seong Ok!

67
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,060
The reason I wanted to see you today...

68
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,240
was because I wanted to give you this.

69
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,950
Let's...

70
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,990
Let's stop...

71
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,780
hurting anymore.

72
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,880
Let's go back. Please?

73
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,380
The last time we met here,

74
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,630
it felt like we were back in the old days, although it was brief.

75
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:26,470
So I thought maybe we could go back...

76
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,790
to the way we were.

77
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,330
While I was waiting here thinking that,

78
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,180
this place looked so sparkly.

79
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,040
Just like we did before.

80
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,130
But I realized it after waiting for you a while.

81
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,240
We...

82
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,470
no longer sparkle.

83
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,110
Why do you...

84
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,730
keep thinking it won't work?

85
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,890
Is it because of that day?

86
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,150
I already know that you didn't do anything.

87
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,370
Do you think I won't know that?

88
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,440
Seong Ok,

89
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,620
I'll make sure...

90
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,920
you never wait alone...

91
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,060
ever again.

92
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,980
Hyeon Seong.

93
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,630
Yes?

94
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,000
Do you regret our seven years together?

95
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,070
No. Not at all.

96
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,660
Me, neither.

97
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:09,040
I loved you the best I could, with no regrets.

98
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
That's why...

99
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,440
I want to stop.

100
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,910
I waited for you to say this.

101
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,840
If so...

102
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,920
How about...

103
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,200
we stay friends?

104
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,960
Friends?

105
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,710
Can you be friends with me?

106
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,920
Yes.

107
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,800
If we work hard, we could...

108
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,820
I don't think I could.

109
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,400
Because I loved you.

110
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,700
I'll go now.

111
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,810
   

112
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,050
 Why the long face? 

113
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,360
Because I'm exhausted.

114
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,250
 Why are you so exhausted? 

115
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,050
Because I miss you.

116
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,380
 I'm here. Right here. 

117
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,000
   

118
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,920
 It's because I like you. 

119
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,220
 Crazy bastard. 

120
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,610
Why did I say that at that moment?

121
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,950
Gosh. Ouch.

122
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,840
 Did you get home safely? 

123
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,370
 You might find what I said last night shocking... 

124
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,380
Wu Ram,

125
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,380
will you have that chocolate cookie?

126
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,030
Well...

127
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,750
here. You can have it.

128
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,800
Thank you.

129
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,270
Ms. Kim, I finished eating.

130
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,840
Good job. Go put the plate away.

131
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,580
Okay.

132
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,730
Wu Ram, you like chocolate cookies, too. Why did you give it to her?

133
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,330
Because I like Hye Rim.

134
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,300
 Hye Ryeong, do you want some of my steak? 

135
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,700
 You like stealing my food. 

136
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,470
But I haven't had a chance to tell her yet.

137
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,360
I'm sure she knows how you feel, too.

138
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,240
- Really? 
 - Of course.

139
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,590
 I need to tell you something. 

140
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,810
 Congratulations! 

141
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:33,730
Team Leader, our sales went up by 115% thanks to the ad campaign.

142
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,360
Gosh, thank you.

143
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,190
Go ahead and blow out the candle.

144
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,330
This is all thanks to you, Team Leader Han.

145
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:56,130
The person in charge at Winders came up with great ideas.

146
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,060
Right. I heard he didn't come to the shoot.

147
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,680
Why didn't he show up after coming up with such a great idea?

148
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,130
I know. It's a sensibility you get only through experience.

149
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:15,040
The important thing is that we have a good chance of joining Winders thanks to Team Leader Han, right?

150
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,170
- Seriously. 
 - It's so great.

151
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,410
Since Team Leader Lee wrapped up the ad campaign successfully,

152
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,620
we finally decided to launch the new brand!

153
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,830
Team Leader, you're the best.

154
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:36,490
And applause for Mr. Jeong, who worked hard for our success.

155
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,860
 - Does it fit? 
 - It's crooked. 

156
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,040
 - What? 
 - It's crooked. 

157
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,150
 Move the left side up a bit. 

158
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,760
 - The left? 
 - Yes, yes, yes. 

159
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,730
 - Like this? 
 - And move to the right. 

160
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,160
 - To the right? 
 - To the right. 

161
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,000
 Done. 

162
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,450
 - What do you think? 
 - It's great. 

163
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,990
 Let's become successful for sure. 

164
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,130
 Let's prove it to those who said we couldn't do it. 

165
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,510
 I don't want to do it for other people. 

166
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,840
 We should do it for us. 

167
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,080
 So we can continue to work together. Don't you think? 

168
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,840
 You're right. 

169
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,170
 Sounds good! 

170
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,610
 Let's make sure to become successful for us. 

171
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,320
 Okay. 

172
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,420
By the way, what were you doing instead of attending the shoot?

173
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,450
Why were you fixing the faulty products we discarded?

174
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,550
- Pardon? 
 - You know.

175
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,410
Hyeon Seong hyeong is a perfectionist.

176
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,590
It's good to have that kind of attitude,

177
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,290
but you don't have to do useless stuff.

178
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,850
The shoot was more important.

179
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,390
Useless stuff?

180
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:03,790
Come on. We saved about a million won thanks to him.

181
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,260
Okay. Let's have a team meal with that one million.

182
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,960
Sounds good.

183
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,760
Good job, Hyeong.

184
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,060
Pick what you want. Beef? Tuna?

185
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,330
- Tuna? 
 - Okay, tuna.

186
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,410
Mr. Park.

187
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,900
What is it? You don't like tuna?

188
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,790
Did I do something useless?

189
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,390
I guess it technically was.

190
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,160
I see.

191
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,530
What are you doing right now, Hyeong?

192
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,580
I want to stop.

193
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,390
Stop what?

194
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,950
Doing something useless.

195
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,180
Thank you for everything.

196
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,730
What are you talking about?

197
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,970
Are you saying you're quitting?

198
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,580
Yes.

199
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,750
Do you even know what you're saying right now?

200
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,870
You're mistaken. They don't give you projects because of who you are.

201
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,190
It's because of Winders.

202
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,270
It's cold outside. Don't you know?

203
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,600
I know, but...

204
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,140
I no longer have a reason to work here.

205
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,440
It's all meaningless.

206
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,820
Move.

207
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,520
Hey, Jeong Hyeon Seong.

208
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,170
 I wonder what it would've been like. 

209
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,200
 I won't do it. 

210
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,270
 What would it have been like if I signed the contract then? 

211
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,930
 Do you want to go to Neverland? 

212
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,190
 - All of a sudden? 
 - We used to go often. It's been a while. 

213
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,520
 What would it have been like if we went then? 

214
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,470
 What would it have been like... 

215
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,950
 if we met then? 

216
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:03,780
 What would it have been like if we stayed friends, as Hyeon Seong said? 

217
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,430
 But... 

218
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,060
 I don't think that could happen. 

219
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,000
You came.

220
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,630
Yes.

221
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,120
Why...

222
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,530
do you like me?

223
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,230
To be honest,

224
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,540
I'm not so sure why I came to like you.

225
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,250
At some point,

226
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,830
I started thinking about you all day.

227
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,830
I'm not asking you to reciprocate.

228
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,080
I'm not asking you to go out with me, either.

229
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,470
Of course, on my way here after you messaged me,

230
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,470
I got a little bit...

231
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,340
a tiny bit excited for some reason, but...

232
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,510
I...

233
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,560
don't regret confessing...

234
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,250
my feelings to you.

235
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,110
Come on. Seriously.

236
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,490
Sorry.

237
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,790
We can no longer be friends

238
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,800
like we used to, right?

239
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,670
How could we?

240
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:30,330
You found out that I like you now.

241
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,600
After you told me how you feel,

242
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,880
I've been thinking a lot.

243
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,290
I wonder why I haven't noticed all this time.

244
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,660
 I have a new boyfriend. 

245
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,340
 Pig, aren't you curious? 

246
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,440
 Why should I care if you got a boyfriend or not? 

247
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,350
 I'll get going now. 

248
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,060
 You'll say you didn't eat enough today and ask for another meal, right? 

249
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,740
 Thank you for the sushi. 

250
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,350
 You crazy bastard. 

251
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,780
 Hold on. I think you're mistaken. Hold on. 

252
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,340
 Let go. Let go of my girlfriend's hand, okay? 

253
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,720
But as I got to thinking deeper,

254
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,710
I felt...

255
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,140
slightly betrayed, too.

256
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,440
We were friends.

257
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,100
But as I got to thinking more,

258
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:40,780
I felt bad, too.

259
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:46,670
I always bragged about my boyfriend and asked for your advice.

260
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,200
When I got to thinking about that,

261
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,810
I felt kind of grateful.

262
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,390
About what?

263
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,550
It must've been difficult listening to that.

264
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,220
But you always listened without showing that at all.

265
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:08,750
You tried to make me laugh and comfort me.

266
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,160
I'm sure I never could've done that.

267
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,260
Thinking about that...

268
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,850
made me think of you...

269
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,380
as a man, a tiny bit.

270
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,620
Gosh, I must be crazy.

271
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,940
Thinking of Pig as a man?

272
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,280
Hey.

273
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,440
Huh?

274
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,070
Will you be good to me?

275
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,180
Are you listening to me right now?

276
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,330
Will you be good to me?

277
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,430
You won't be good to me?

278
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,030
No.

279
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,960
Totally! Totally and completely.

280
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,700
Totally! I'll treat you better than anyone in this world!

281
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,770
You mean it, right?

282
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,780
You'd better be good to me.

283
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,960
♫  We're on different paths  ♫

284
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,950
♫  We've come away too far  ♫

285
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,790
A-Are you saying w-we're...

286
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,690
Think however you want. You idiot.

287
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,580
Are we going out?

288
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,470
I don't know, man.

289
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,030
Why would you ask me that?

290
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,790
♫  We took too much of a detour  ♫

291
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,000
♫  Like the countless stars in the night sky, always be there  ♫

292
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,750
♫  Will you look up at me if I become a star?  ♫

293
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,170
Be quiet. Someone might complain.

294
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,880
Okay.

295
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,550
♫  You've always waited for me  ♫

296
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,040
♫  I promise to you now  ♫

297
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,700
Come here.

298
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,590
♫  Stay  ♫

299
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,610
Stop freaking out and wait.

300
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,540
Wait.

301
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,990
Tell me.

302
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,550
- Listen carefully. 
 - Okay.

303
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,940
You're not allowed to touch me for now.

304
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,010
I'm not that ready yet.

305
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,550
Okay. Sure. Of course.

306
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,310
What? Why do you look sad?

307
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,510
What were you trying to do?

308
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,510
No, it's nothing.

309
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,700
Are you serious right now?

310
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,450
Make sure to behave yourself.

311
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,510
Okay, I will.

312
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:42,810
Gosh, look at your face. You said you were fine.

313
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,400
You're not good at fighting. Why did you step in?

314
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,340
You'd better not get into fights with anyone from now on, okay?

315
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,940
Okay. Never.

316
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,770
I like how obedient you are.

317
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,520
Of course, I should be. It's your order.

318
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,850
Will you listen to anything I say?

319
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,520
Of course. Just tell me. What is it? What can I do for you?

320
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,040
If so...

321
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,750
Dance.

322
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,370
Dance.

323
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,590
Okay.

324
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,880
- Do popping. 
 - Popping.

325
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,000
Krumping.

326
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,740
- Trot. 
 - Trot.

327
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,450
- Shuffle. 
 - Shuffle.

328
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:45,370
 I'm not sure how long it'd take to stop being friends. 

329
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:51,250
 But I think we can make it work, since we were friends. 

330
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,190
I'll start cutting. You won't regret it, right?

331
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,650
No.

332
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,610
 I'm sure I'll regret it. 

333
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:19,290
 Even if a lot of time passes and my regrets get diminished, 

334
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,390
 whether it's a good or bad memory, 

335
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,790
 I'll think of Seong Ok out of the blue. 

336
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,020
 I find that too cruel. 

337
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,050
Over here!

338
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,640
Come here. Come here.

339
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,890
What? You bought all of these?

340
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,570
They're all the things you wanted to eat.

341
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:25,070
Seriously. Are you still Pig, who didn't want to pay for a taxi after missing the last bus?

342
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,460
I'm more than happy to feed you.

343
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,090
Thank you. I'll enjoy them.

344
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,080
Is it tasty?

345
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,990
It's so tasty.

346
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,280
Wow, I wonder...

347
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,870
if you have to be so pretty when you eat, too.

348
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,260
Come on.

349
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,210
You fool.

350
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,830
Is there anything you wanted to do if we started dating?

351
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,630
Of course...

352
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,550
Of course, there is.

353
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,590
But It's nothing.

354
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,270
What? You had a dirty thought again, didn't you?

355
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,840
No, it's not like that.

356
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,460
I can tell by looking at your face.

357
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,630
Gosh.

358
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,810
Should we go on a trip?

359
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:14,090
Let's go on a trip, eat tasty stuff, and take photos, too.

360
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,240
Sounds good. Where should we go?

361
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,350
We'll have to stay overnight if we go somewhere far.

362
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,730
Would somewhere nearby be better?

363
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,900
Well...

364
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,800
That's... You're right.

365
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,510
But I don't think it'd be bad to go somewhere far. Because...

366
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,390
it's fun to go somewhere far...

367
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,810
somewhere far for a trip, too... yeah...

368
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,500
Oh Fatty, is anything fun going on?

369
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,340
Are you looking for something?

370
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,350
Well...

371
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,200
Hey, Oh...

372
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,510
Where's Min Hyeok?

373
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,140
Oh, he's on vacation for two days to go on a trip.

374
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,240
- With whom? 
 - I wouldn't know that.

375
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,810
I see.

376
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,830
Okay. Thank you.

377
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,010
You scared me.

378
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,720
Jeong Hyeon Seong.

379
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,130
Did something happen to you?

380
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,560
- What do you mean? 
 - Your hair...

381
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,030
I just cut it.

382
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,540
I see.

383
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,700
I'm here, Oh Fatty.

384
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,570
He isn't here.

385
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,260
Shouldn't he be here?

386
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,220
I don't know. He went on a trip, apparently.

387
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,550
- With whom? 
 - I wonder.

388
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,200
- I find that to be a mystery, too. 
 - Wow...

389
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,000
What are you doing here instead of going to work?

390
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,070
I'm unemployed.

391
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,350
Something happened, huh?

392
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,350
Yeah...

393
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,500
Oh Fatty isn't here.

394
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,480
That's a serious problem.

395
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,100
Hey!

396
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,570
Go away! Away!

397
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,650
Gosh, I forgot how nice it is to go on trips.

398
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,320
Huh? What do you mean?

399
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,260
I didn't know when I went with those losers,

400
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,880
but it's nice to come with a girlfriend.

401
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,640
I think so, too.

402
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,460
Really?

403
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,450
So nice!

404
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,780
 This is a good time to hold her hand, right? 

405
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,290
Look over there! It's so pretty, isn't it?

406
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,770
What? That? It's so pretty. Wow.

407
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,970
Should we go take a photo there?

408
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,700
Shall we? Hold on.

409
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,820
Ta-da.

410
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,880
What's this?

411
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,130
They're matching hoodies.

412
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,900
D-Do you not like it?

413
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,560
No, I like it.

414
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,320
- Really? 
 - Gosh, when did you prepare this?

415
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,420
It's so cute.

416
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,330
No, this is better.

417
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,530
Here, maybe?

418
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,220
Okay.

419
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,900
 She's my girlfriend now. 

420
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,040
 I can touch her shoulder, at least, right? 

421
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,390
- What are you doing? 
 - Huh?

422
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,400
- Look over here. 
 - Okay.

423
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,800
One, two, three.

424
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,890
   

425
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
Are you tired?

426
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,050
No, it's not that.

427
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,800
 Would it be too smooth for me to suggest going to the room? 

428
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,770
 But to pretend to be innocent... 

429
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:23,960
 I already told him too many stories. 

430
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,600
 We haven't even kissed but came to a hotel. 

431
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,520
 What should I say? 

432
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,620
 "Should we go rest? Go to bed?" 

433
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,820
Should I take you to your room?

434
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,600
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

435
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,090
Come this way, please.

436
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,430
 Shit. Whatever. 

437
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:19,340
 Let's show her. You can do it, Oh Min Hyeok! 

438
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,510
Gosh, I'm sorry! Are you hurt?

439
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,960
No, I'm okay.

440
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,040
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

441
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,850
Do you not want to by chance?

442
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,730
I do. It's not like that at all.

443
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,670
What is it, then?

444
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,940
How should I say it?

445
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,190
It feels like it shouldn't be happening.

446
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,710
Being here like this with you...

447
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,130
makes me feel nervous and awkward, too.

448
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:14,670
Sorry. But it's not because I don't want to.

449
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,800
I think I know what you mean.

450
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,870
I kind of feel that way, too.

451
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,680
It's normal.

452
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,240
We still have memories as friends.

453
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:30,250
But we talked about this at a café recently.

454
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,520
That we don't seem to see each other as friends faster than expected.

455
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,850
Yes.

456
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:38,160
So, Hye Ryeong,

457
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,580
don't worry if you don't feel ready yet.

458
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,700
I'll wait, whenever that may be.

459
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:57,230
Well, we don't have to hold back.

460
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,940
I've wanted to kiss you before, too,

461
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,960
but I'm nervous for some reason since it's actually happening.

462
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,950
So you don't have to worry about me so much.

463
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,420
What do you mean by that?

464
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,330
Come on, Pig.

465
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,200
You're so clueless.

466
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,120
Hye Ryeong.

467
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,100
 This is how... 

468
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,440
 we're becoming... 

469
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,720
 a real couple. 

470
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,290
   

471
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,270
   

472
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,100
Not a single one.

473
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:06,670
   

474
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,110
 This is my first birthday without Seong Ok. 

475
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,540
 At least, 

476
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,600
 I don't feel as raw as I used to. 

477
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,220
 I think I healed exactly as much as the distance between us. 

478
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,490
- Two, three... 
  - Ta-da! 

479
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,960
What are you doing on your birthday?

480
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,570
You losers. Seriously.

481
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,640
Are things going well?

482
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,990
They probably will, eventually.

483
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,990
You're talking as if it doesn't concern you.

484
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,650
Are you eating properly, at least?

485
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,660
Eat some of this.

486
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,810
Why did you order food? We could've just eaten whatever.

487
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,300
It's your birthday.

488
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,710
Wow. Birthdays are nice.

489
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,460
Don't just eat the chicken. Eat the noodles, too.

490
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,020
Chicken and noodles are trendy these days.

491
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,010
Chicken and noodles?

492
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,150
They're spicy and sweet together.

493
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:21,320
Hey, it's okay to say it's tasty.

494
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,860
It's spicy and sweet, as you said.

495
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,330
By the way, why haven't we seen Oh Fatty lately?

496
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,000
Is he seeing someone?

497
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,150
- No way. 
 - You never know.

498
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,720
You know, his middle school classmate.

499
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,430
When will I finally have a girlfriend?

500
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,060
I don't have one because of my looks, right?

501
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,820
My face is kind of attractive.

502
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,320
Is it because I'm short?

503
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,000
But there's nothing I can do about it.

504
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,710
You got your insoles.

505
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,710
I didn't tell you guys this,

506
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,280
but I've been having nightmares since that day when I think I forgot.

507
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,380
Cheer up. Don't have nightmares over such a thing.

508
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,730
Height isn't everything.

509
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,780
What do women find most important, then?

510
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,560
What women find important isn't important.

511
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,470
Knowing what's important to the person you like is important.

512
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,690
You're still An Si Hu, right?

513
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,950
I'll seriously focus on one person from now on.

514
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,350
- Really? 
 - Yes.

515
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,450
He must have someone.

516
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,890
Her name is Yu Na.

517
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,060
I met her recently. She's nice.

518
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,240
She's sincere toward me.

519
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,090
- Oh, really? 
 - Yeah.

520
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:44,580
Wow, An Si Hu is all grown up now.

521
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,940
How are you these days?

522
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,050
Me? What do you mean?

523
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,030
I mean Seong Ok.

524
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,230
I'm okay.

525
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,880
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

526
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,870
No, I'm really okay.

527
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,110
Okay. That's good, then.

528
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:17,700
I need to call Yu Na for a second.

529
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,080
- An Si Hu. 
 - Yes?

530
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,670
You look happy.

531
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,650
Gosh, I'm jealous.

532
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,170
 First of all, thank you. 

533
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:46,620
 When I lost confidence and tried to quit hip-hop, 

534
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,850
 some Hyeong told me this. 

535
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:54,650
 He said, "Don't give up on your dream because of the standards created by others." 

536
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,270
 He told me to have faith in the person... 

537
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,780
 who had faith in me. 

538
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:05,620
 I think I came this far thanks to what he said. 

539
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:09,110
 Thank you, the hyeong I don't know the name of! 

540
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,330
 Here you go. 

541
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,870
 And it's something you have already started. 

542
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,760
 Don't be afraid since you got started. 

543
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,740
 Thank you, Hyeong. 

544
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,110
 I won't give up. 

545
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,940
♫  Don't be afraid since you got started  ♫

546

553

555
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,820
Look.

The green one and the gray one. You have the invoice, right?

571
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,330
Put these in a box and attach that.

572
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:39,400
Okay, but is this the one?

573
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,450
You should tell us if it's a hoodie or a T-shirt.

574
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,570
What are you doing? Hurry up. Hurry, hurry.

575
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:47,180
Can't we report him to the labor department?

576
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:52,200
There's no time to zone out right now.

577
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:55,600
Whoa.

578
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,410
Hi.

579
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,710
What's with this disgusting picture?

580
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,820
Say hello.

581
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,200
She's your future sister-in-law.

582
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,720
Hello. We met at the bar last time.

583
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:19,500
Hey, we shouldn't be talking about love now.

584
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,410
Think about the customers who are waiting.

585
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:22,560
Hurry, hurry. You should come, too.

586
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,990
Well, we need to go...

587
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,630
- What are you doing? 
 - Let's help them.

588
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:29,300
Babe, we're supposed to go on a date.

589
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,780
This is your date. Right here.

590
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,840
"Babe? Babe?"

591
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:38,080
Don't be like that.

592
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:45,970
   

593
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,910
You know you don't have to worry about marketing the moment you join Winders.

594
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,330
I know it's tough on your own now.

595
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:58,280
Just worry about the design. We'll take care of the business side.

596
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,200
Please join us.

597
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,820
Use Myeong Jin whenever you need him.

598
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,270
Aren't you going to answer?

599
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,850
Pardon?

600
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,240
Oh, of course.

601
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,260
Let me know if you need anything.

602
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:28,360
Then, Winders will only do marketing

603
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,630
and H2 will have all the rights.

604
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,790
Yes, of course.

605
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,300
Take a look. It says right here.

606
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,790
Get him a pen.

607
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,870
Hey, why bring this pen for this sacred contract?

608
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,220
Can't you find a proper one?

609
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,230
Oh, okay.

610
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,200
   

611
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,170
That's great.

612
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:33,870
   

613
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,950
 I wasn't sure if I should send this. 

614
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:40,180
 But I couldn't imagine H2 without you. 

615
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,880
 I'd love it if you came. 

616
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,700
 I'll be waiting. 

617
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,050
What are you looking at?

618
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,780
Huh?

619
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,140
No, it's nothing.

620
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,850
I can tell it's not nothing.

621
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:10,210
I got an invitation for H2's relaunch.

622
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,430
I see.

623
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,220
You're going, right?

624
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,420
No. I'm not going.

625
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,910
I need to work, you know.

626
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:25,420
Why not? Aren't you a crucial part of H2?

627
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,710
It's all in the past now.

628
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,940
I'm serious.

629
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,500
What's with that face?

630
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,030
Is it because of me, by chance?

631
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,580
What are you saying? It's not like that.

632
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:50,070
It is. Because of me... I should go.

633
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,460
You should go home now.

634
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,530
Nuna.

635
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:07,970
I trust and support you no matter what you decide.

636
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:12,160
You always make the right decision.

637
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,220
   

638
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:31,940
   

639
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,950
   

640
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,870
Congratulations, CEO Jeong.

641
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:07,080
- You made it. 
 - Congrats, Hyeong.

642
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,120
Yes, thank you.

643
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,070
Are you sure this is a fried chicken place?

644
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,070
This is totally my style.

645
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,810
Should we have a team dinner here?

646
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:15,110
Sounds good.

647
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,490
I know you're busy, but let's drink together later.

648
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:19,150
Okay.

649
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,380
When is everyone coming, by the way?

650
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,520
They said they were almost here.

651
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,430
President Jeong.

652
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,540
You came.

653
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,640
Seriously. Congratulations.

654
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,980
Thank you. Thank you.

655
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,840
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

656
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,850
Jeong Hyeon Seong, long time no see.

657
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:42,760
Yes, it's been a while. Have you been well?

658
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,870
Of course, I have.

659
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:47,890
Wow, you got even more handsome.

660
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:50,030
You're successful now, aren't you?

661
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,080
No, it's not like that.

662
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,990
Looks like all the losers are here.

663
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:58,260
It's nice to be called a loser, like in the old days.

664
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,560
Say hello. It's my girlfriend.

665
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,180
Hello. I heard a lot about you.

666
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,890
Oh, I see.

667
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:08,360
Let me know if he has something on you.

668
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,810
I'll take care of things for you...

669
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:15,760
She's my girlfriend. We love each other.

670
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,950
I was just kidding.

671
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,150
Where's our table, by the way?

672
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,310
It's in the back over here.

673
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,440
Thank you.

674
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,810
- See you later. 
 - Go have a seat.

675
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:26,970
You look cool.

676
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,070
Have a seat. Have a seat.

677
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:31,490
Hey, what are you doing here?

678
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:35,510
Geez, I am a shareholder of H2, okay?

679
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,600
You are? Share, my foot.

680
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,320
We haven't seen each other in a while. Don't pick a fight.

681
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,540
That's why I'm picking a fight.

682
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,880
Let's drink together later.

683
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,420
- Okay. 
 - Have a seat.

684
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,590
By the way, didn't she come with Seong Ok?

685
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,090
Hey.

686
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:58,150
Okay. Don't be so sensitive.

687
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:29,970
It's been a while since we all got together. Let's drink.

688
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:32,140
Okay.

689
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,090
All right. Raise your glasses.

690
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:38,970
President Jeong, raise your glass.

691
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:40,540
Okay.

692
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,540
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

693
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,310
 What did I expect? 

694
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:59,360
Hyeon Seong, I think you should thank the guests or something.

695
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,870
Okay.

696
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,640
Hurry.

697
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:26,530
You're so cool, Jeong Hyeon Seong!

698
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,280
Thank you so much for making time to come here.

699
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,870
I'm Jeong Hyeon Seong, the CEO of H2.

700
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,620
H2 means "Hip to Human."

701
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:56,030
It means we aspire to a trendiness that's devoted to humanity.

702
00:54:56,030 --> 00:55:00,260
As a native street fashion brand based in Seoul,

703
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,750
H2 will expand and enter the global market as well.

704
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:08,470
And we'll focus more on the jewelry line in addition to the fashion line.

705
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:10,320
Also...

706
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:25,490


707
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:32,030
♫  From downpour to the rainbow  ♫ 
 ♫  Anything looks great  ♫

708
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,930
♫  From the sun to midnight moon  ♫

709
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:37,710
♫  When I'm with you, when I'm with you  ♫

710
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:43,870
♫  From downpour to the rainbow  ♫ 
 ♫  Anything looks great  ♫

711
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:48,540
♫  From the sun to midnight moon  ♫

712
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,780
 Seong Ok came. 

713
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,850
   

714
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:00,220
♫  Whenever I was struggling  ♫

715
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:04,720
♫  I called you without realizing and bothered you  ♫

716
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,610
♫  But you let me be by your side  ♫

717
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,100
♫  With a mischievous smile  ♫

718
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,100
 We acknowledge you as an official couple. 

719
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:20,680
 Some love comes to fruition after sharing a long time together. 

720
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,410
 Today is our 100th day together. 

721
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:26,100
 Let's take a photo every hour to celebrate it. 

722
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:32,180
 And some find love when they finally can let go of their love from the past. 

723
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,500
 Whether it's good or bad, you exist in all the memories I have. 

724
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,700
 Do you think it's easy for me to forget someone I was with for seven years? 

725
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:44,080
 Thank you... 

726
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:47,100
 Han Seong Ok. 

727
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,080
♫  Like the countless stars in the night sky, I will always be there  ♫

728
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:56,050
 And we're trying to move forward. 

729
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,390
 - Do you think... 
 - Yes? 

730
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:02,860
 can we run H2 together? 

731
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,050
 Because I need you. 

732
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:06,810
♫  I promise you now  ♫

733
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:09,400
♫  Stay, stay  ♫

734
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,610
♫  Whenever you're hurting  ♫
