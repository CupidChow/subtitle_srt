1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,630
   

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,200
What are you up to?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,330
 Hey, Hyeon Seong. 

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,850
Let's grab a drink.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,370
 Well, I'm a bit busy right now. 

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,700
What are you doing?

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,480
 Who is it? 

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,500
Hello?

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,620
I'm at the store right now. Talk to you later.

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,610
Is something going on?

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,750
Well, the thing is...

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,120
It was Hyeon Seong, wasn't it?

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,910
Well, yes.

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,930
Is he doing well?

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,340
Well, yes.

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,010
I see.

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,250
- The thing is— 
 - Nuna, should we order anything else?

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,160
Yes. Go ahead if you want something.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,090
Okay.

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,400
Why did you drink so fast? You should've drank slowly with me.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,610
Sir, we'll have a 500 ml  (~ 1 pt) beer and a menu. 

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,450
Your Hubae is so quick.

23
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,500
It's not that. I just care.

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,880
- Care? 
 - I just want to care for our designer.

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,770
Here we go again. You don't have to do that for me.

26
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,660
Come on. There's no designer better than you.

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,130
Thank you.

28
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,360
Right, I went to Winders today.

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,860
- Winders? 
 - Yes.

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,350
Jewelry A and Winders are discussing collaborating. Isn't that great?

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,070
Oh, right...

32
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,910
I see.

33
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,000
By the way,

34
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,120
did you hear anything about H2 by chance?

35
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,690
 H2's CEO turned us down, saying he created the brand with his girlfriend. 

36
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,570
 I suppose love overcame work. 

37
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,540
They didn't say much.

38
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,450
I see.

39
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,300
Thank you.

40
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,260
Our beer's here. Should we raise glasses to celebrate working together?

41
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,580
Yes. Congratulations, Seong Ok.

42
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,650
A toast. For Designer Seong Ok, who will be joining Jewelry A!

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,030
 - Cheers.  
 - Thank you.

44
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,620
What should we get? Do you want anything?

45
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,960
Instead of chicken?

46
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,240
I'll go to the restroom real quick.

47
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:57,880


48
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,650
 - Geez. 
 - I'm sorry-  
    

49
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,580
 Yu Ju Nuna. 

50
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,740
What are you thinking about?

51
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,310
Your girlfriend?

52
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,380
I don't have one, I said.

53
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,650
Why? Because you're thinking of your boyfriend?

54
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,440
What are you saying? I don't have one, either.

55
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,490
What? You can't just drink alone like that.

56
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,760
I can have another one, then.

57
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,060
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

58
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,090
You heard it just now.

59
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,290
I opened the door.

60
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,900
I really am home.

61
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,660
I didn't drink a lot.

62
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,510
Yes. You should go to bed early, too.

63
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,550
I'll hang up.

64
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,690
 Yu Ju Nuna, right? 

65
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,530
- I'll answer this. 
 - Okay.

66
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,750
   

67
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,500
Hey. How many times did I call you?

68
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,160
We just slept once. That's all.

69
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,430
Did I ask to go out with you?

70
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,410
I'm a piece of trash.

71
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,490
Don't call anymore.

72
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,530
Who was that?

73
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,490
Are you sure it wasn't your girlfriend?

74
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,310
It's not.

75
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,360
Why? Do you want to check?

76
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,700
What?

77
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,490
Look. You'll show me your phone, too, instead.

78
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,310
It's okay.

79
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,630
I trust you.

80
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,690
You trust me?

81
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,070
- How long have you known me? 
 - That's not important.

82
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,760
I trust you because I like you.

83
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,550
Don't trust people too easily.

84
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,040
Why?

85
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,200
Don't you trust me, Oppa?

86
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,750
   

87
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,600
It's my brother.

88
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,830
Hey, Oppa. Where could I be? I'm home.

89
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:39,250
 Loving someone is probably about how well you deceive each other. 

90
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,670
Hey, Si Hu.

91
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,220
It's me.

92
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,850
 Son Yong Min. Shoot! Goal! 

93
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,730
 Son Yong Min achieved a hat-trick! 

94
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:43,330
 Son Yong Min! Son Yong Min! 

95
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,110
 Son Yong Min has achieved a hat-trick! 

96
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,460
 Goal! 

97
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,520
 Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! 

98
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,000
 It's a goal! Goal! 

99
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:11,100
♫  Everything was beautiful  ♫

100
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,990
♫  The beautiful moments  ♫

101
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,490
♫  We were stars in the midnight sky  ♫

102
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,400
♫  Every time, every day  ♫

103
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,490
 I'll get going first. It was good to see you today. 
   

104
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,010
   

105
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:41,680
♫  Every time, every day  ♫

106
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,020
Jeong Hyeon Seong!

107
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
What are you doing here?

108
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,590
Looks like you're having fun.

109
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,680
Huh? Wow.

110
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,020
Hey, Yong Min had a hat-trick.

111
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,790
I just watched a soccer game with a college hubae.

112
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,840
Yong Min's third goal. It was incredible.

113
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,570
Which college hubae?

114
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,150
Well, there's one you don't know.

115
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,820
Which hubae that I don't know?

116
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,380
What are you doing right now?

117
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,180
I just thought I'd ask.

118
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,760
Are you okay?

119
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,930
Of course, I am.

120
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,840
Okay. I'll leave since I got to see you.

121
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,360
You're just leaving?

122
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,220
You're already here. Come in.

123
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,770
No, I'm tired. See you.

124
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,040
   

125
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,870
Are you okay, Nuna?

126
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,950
   

127
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,600
Excuse me.

128
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,580
A taxi's here, Nuna.

129
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,880
Let's walk up there.

130
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,110
Hello.

131
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,810
Be careful.

132
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,820
Hello.

133
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,000
Si Hu.

134
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,810
 Ryu Eun Jeong! 
  

135
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,040
 Ryu Eun Jeong! Ryu Eun Jeong! 
   

136
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,410
 Ryu Eun Jeong! Ryu Eun Jeong! 

137
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,660
 Ryu Eun Jeong! Ryu Eun Jeong! 

138
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,740
 Ryu Eun Jeong! Ryu Eun Jeong! 

139
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,940
 - Go for it! 
 - Let's go! 

140
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,050
 Goal! 

141
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,120
 Ryu Eun Jeong! 

142
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,060
 Eun Jeong! You did it! 

143
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,380
 Good job! 

144
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,790
 Eun Jeong! 

145
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,900
 Good job! 

146
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,440
 Nuna, over here. Over here. 

147
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,930
 What are you doing? Eun Jeong just scored. 

148
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,370
 I'm sorry. I'm so late. 

149
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,860
 - Did you run? 
 - Yes, a little. 

150
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,260
 Hey, who's that? 

151
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,160
 I don't know. Wow, she's so pretty. 

152
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,450
 Are they your friends? 

153
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,030
 Yes. 

154
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,660
 - Who is she? 
 - Hey. 

155
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,700
 Greet her properly. 

156
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,100
 She's my girlfriend. 

157
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,100
 What? Are you jealous? 

158
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,380
 Yes. Totally. 

159
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,220
 - Hey, Jeong Hyeon Seong. 
 - I'm jealous. 

160
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,280
 I'll go see Jeong. 

161
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,250
 Okay. I'll go see her, too. 

162
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,590
 Wait for me! 

163
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,830
 Seong Ok. 

164
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,040
 Do you like her? 

165
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,900
 - No. 
 - Are you happy? 

166
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,780
 - I am. 
 - Not because of me, but her. 

167
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,530
 Your jaw was about to drop to the ground. 

168
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,340
 No. I was shocked because he said she was his girlfriend. 

169
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,460
 You must be jealous. 

170
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,050
 I'm not jealous at all. 

171
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,950
 I'm not jealous because you're a million times prettier. Come here. Come here. Come here. 

172
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,330
 Come here. Come here. 

173
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,010
 - Hey! 
 - That's enough. 

174
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,180
 Congrats! Congrats. 

175
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,780
 - Was I cool? 
 - Totally. It was crazy. 

176
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,200
 - Was I cool? 
 - Yes, I almost cried. 

177
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,590
 Take this. 

178
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,770
 What is it? 

179
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,330
 A film camera? 

180
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,830
 You worked a part-time job because you wanted this. 

181
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,820
 Wow, daebak. 

182
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,590
 Thank you so much, Nuna. 

183
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,360
 By the way, isn't this too much? 

184
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,630
 It's okay. 

185
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,220
 Think of me whenever you use it. 

186
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,950
 Okay. 

187
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,980
 Let's take a picture, Nuna. 

188
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,820
 I want to take my first one with you. 

189
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,090
 Okay. 

190
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,400
 Hey. 

191
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,990
 Take one of us. 

192
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,170
 - Me? 
 - Hurry. 

193
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,870
 Okay, here we go. 

194
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,000
 Gosh, why isn't Kim Hyeong Seop here? 

195
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,800
 - One, two... 
 - When I was 23 years old, 

196
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,160
 - three! 
 - I met Yu Ju Nuna, who was 29 years old. 

197
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,420
 She was my first love. 

198
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,040
 Please. Please. 

199
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,840
 Okay! 

200
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,430
 Gosh, seriously. 

201
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,610
 Why is it so hard to get into classes? 

202
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,590
 I managed to get classes on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. 

203
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,650
 I can see you on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. 

204
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,770
 Are you listening? 

205
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:13,100
 Hold on. I need to finish something by today. Let me finish it first. 

206
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,320
 It was the first time I realized, that someone could look so pretty while working. 

207
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,340
 Nuna, let me take a photo. 

208
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,170
 What? 

209
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,250
 Did you take one? 

210
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,840
 Yeah. I wanted to take one since you looked cool working. 

211
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,070
 Why did you take a film photo? You can't check immediately. 

212
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,410
 But it's nice. 

213
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,510
 It makes you look forward to getting the picture printed. 

214
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,800
 It's easy to delete and retake on the phone, 

215
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,870
 but with this, I feel like you can truly capture the moment. 

216
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,070
 The atmosphere of the space we were in and the feelings from those moments. 

217
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:14,920
 I didn't want to lose any of those things. 

218
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:24,370
 What? I was totally zoned out. 

219
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,290
 I don't really like how you can't check immediately. 

220
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:32,260
 But you'd feel differently about this moment after time passes. 

221
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,640
 You're more of an old soul than I thought. 

222
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,020
 Should we go see a movie tonight? 

223
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,480
 You said you're seeing off a friend who's joining the military. 

224
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,690
 I'll see him when he's on vacation. 

225
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,390
 - I want to be with you. 
 - Come on. 

226
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,510
 Don't be like that and go see him. 

227
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,380
 They hold grudges if you disappoint someone, who is leaving for the military. 

228
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,910
 But I want to be with you. 

229
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,180
 You should do as I say. 

230
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,400
 Hyeon Seong, good luck in the military. 

231
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,620
 - Good luck. 
 - Good luck.

 "Ah-Choo"? Should we do "Ah-Choo"? 

236
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,350

 I'm going through the report I'll submit tomorrow. 

246
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,540
 I miss you, Nuna. 

247
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,370
 Don't be silly. Did you drink a lot? 

248
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,160
 Yes, I'm too drunk. 

249
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,450

254

 Si Hu. 

255
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,800
 I know you're upset about Hyeon Seong joining the military, but still. 

256
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,720
 - Why drink straight from the bottle like that? 
 - Come on, seriously... 

257
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,450
 Don't worry about me. 

258
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,780
 I'll be fine there. 

259

 Yes. Good luck.

 Where are you going? 

261
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,480
 Hey, An Si Hu! Where are you going? 

262
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,700
 Nuna. 

263
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,720
 Are you okay? 

264
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,670
 Gosh, you reek of alcohol. How much did you drink? 

265
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,870
 Well, you know, I wanted to stop drinking, 

266
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,760
 but my friends kept forcing me. 

267
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,080
 You shouldn't have drank all that. Seriously. 

268
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,520
 I was drunk on love those days. 

269
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,420
 Let's go home. I'll drive you. 

270
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:26,390
 Can I stay at your place tonight? 

271
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,620
 My mom will scold me if I go home drunk. 

272
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,130
 What? Weren't you asleep? 

273
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,420
 I'll give you a change of clothes. Sleep comfortably. 

274
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,330
 No. 

275
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,330
 I'll just go to sleep. 

276
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,180
 You pretended to be drunk to do this, didn't you? 

277
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,790
 No. 

278
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,780
 I-It's not like that. 

279
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,120
 Are you okay? 

280
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:12,450
 It's bullshit when they say, the first love hurts. 

281
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,930
 Nuna. 

282
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,360
 I love you. 

283
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:31,580
 My first love was hot enough to burn, but it didn't hurt at all. 

284
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,760
It hurts. Go slowly.

285
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,370
How funny.

286
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,190
Isn't it?

287
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,350
   

288
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,000
What's with you?

289
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,340
You said you went home. Where have you been?

290
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,720
Why didn't you answer the phone?

291
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,050
Why won't you say anything?

292
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,830
I slept with Si Hu.

293
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,740
- What? 
 - You heard me.

294
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,390
Please break up with me.

295
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,760
I don't even want to touch you because you're dirty.

296
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,960
What's gotten into you?

297
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,950
You're treating me to a meal? Not only that, it's sushi?

298
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,960
Something's up, huh?

299
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,800
What are you talking about? Just eat.

300
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,510
 She's pretty. 

301
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,090
Oh Fatty, I invited my boyfriend. You don't mind, right?

302
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,430
Are you asking for permission or notifying me?

303
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,940
To be honest, I need to ask you a favor.

304
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,290
You're finally showing your true color.

305
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,950
I knew it. I have no money.

306
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,640
No, it's not that.

307
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,510
Tell me what you think of him as a man.

308
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:33,490
I like him a lot, but he's too handsome. He's young, too.

309
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,660
Over here.

310
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,380
 Yes. So what if he's handsome? 

311
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,420
 It's all about the personality... 

312
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,590
Hello, Hyeong.

313
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,740
 His personality doesn't look too bad. 

314
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,450
Sit here.

315
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,520
Were you eating?

316
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,390
How did you get here? It must've been hard coming here.

317
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,160
No, it didn't take long. I took a taxi.

318
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,440
You look pretty today.

319
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,780
You think I look pretty?

320
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,080
- I missed you. 
 - Me, too.

321
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,140
I bought a vest to show you too.

322
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,920
Hey.

323
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,370
What are you lacking that you're dating Hye Ryeong?

324
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,130
Why do you say that?

325
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,070
Isn't she so pretty?

326
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,120
   

327
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,520
Let's go to our reservation by eight today.

328
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,050
Is it the one we went to last time?

329
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,230
Hey.

330
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,980
Oh, you didn't get enough.

331
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,280
Nuna told me that you like to eat.

332
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,420
I'll pay today. Eat as much as you'd like, Hyeongnim.

333
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,730
You can't. He eats too much.

334
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,880
You can't, Babe.

335
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,830
It's okay. I got a tax return this year.

336
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:53,490
Really? You're so cool, Babe.

337
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,900
I'll get going now.

338
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,110
Huh? Why are you leaving?

339
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,120
You'll say you didn't eat enough today and ask for another meal, right?

340
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,010
Don't be like that and eat a lot now—

341
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,180
Thank you for the sushi.

342
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,150
So suddenly?

343
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,990
It's on me.

344
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,420
- Bye. 
 - Hey.

345
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,400
I lost both money and love.

346
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,920
You lost everything, Oh Min Hyeok.

347
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,980
You lost everything.

348
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,910
 Would she be at the motel with that punk by now? 

349
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,050
 Calm down. They're a couple. It's normal. 

350
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,120
Geez!

351
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:30,310
 How could I compete with him? He's so good-looking. 

352
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:34,240
 Why am I such a fatty? 

353
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,530
 Oh Fatty! 

354
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,810
 You didn't take a shower, did you? 

355
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:40,220
 - Go get changed! 
 - You're just as bad. 

356
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:46,660
 To me, Hye Ryeong is just a friend who has seen all sides of me for 15 years. 

357
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,540
 A friend. 

358
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,430
 - Yes, she's a friend. 
 - Give me. Give me. 

359
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,410
 - Let go! 
 - Give it to me! 

360
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,980
 I kept trying to think that way, but... 

361
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,860
 at some point, Hye Ryeong had become a real woman to me. 

362
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,550
This is medicine. It's medicine.

363
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,540
This is crazy.

364
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,530
Did you drink again?

365
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,220
Don't take it too far.

366
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,510
How much longer will you be bummed out like that?

367
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,350
Who am I to be saying that? Who am I?

368
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,000
Who am I to be saying that?

369
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,990
- Hey, Oh Fatty. 
 - Yeah.

370
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,330
- Hey, Oh Fatty. 
 - What? Why do you keep calling me?

371
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,020
Do you post on an anonymous forum under your nickname?

372
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,540
- Did you see it? 
 - "What do you do when you develop feelings for your friend?"

373
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,730
"What's the likelihood of us becoming lovers?"

374
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,920
"How would you feel if your friend suddenly confessed their love to you?"

375
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,170
Was it you who commented?

376
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,880
Do the other guys know, by chance?

377
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,550
No. Not yet.

378
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:51,000
Please, please, please. I beg you. Could you keep it to yourself?

379
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,870
Those jerks can't find out. I don't even want to think about it. Please.

380
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,900
It depends on your behavior.

381
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,260
Hold on.

382
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,590
Why were you browsing the relationship advice forum?

383
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,510
What are you saying?

384
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,890
- What? 
 - This was you.

385
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,860
"We broke up after dating for seven years."

386
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:13,220
"I can't sleep because I'm afraid I'd have a dream about my ex-girlfriend."

387
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,150
That's not me.

388
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,060
That's not me. That's not me.

389
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,590
Do you think about Seong Ok and can't sleep?

390
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,800
No, no. I swear it's not me.

391
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,900
- "I'm afraid to fall asleep." 
 - Hey!

392
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,370
Hey. Just call her.

393
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:31,300
Don't regret it later, once too much time passes.

394
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,810
I'll regret it more the moment I press the call button.

395
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,380
If you'll regret it anyway,

396
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,730
just do it.

397
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,450
Isn't it better to regret it afterward?

398
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,360
- Will you do it and regret it? 
 - What would I do?

399
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,890
Her name is Kim Hye Ryeong, right? Your middle school classmate.

400
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,980
She has a tall, handsome, nice boyfriend.

401
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,070
How did you know that?

402
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:53,130
You said all that in here, Punk.

403
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,010
Damn it!

404
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,590
By the way, why do you suddenly have feelings for your friend?

405
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,320
I don't know.

406
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,230
I really... I really don't know. I...

407
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,450
I think I'm crazy.

408
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,840
I even imagine her being at a motel with her boyfriend.

409
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,120
And I can't sleep whenever I think about that.

410
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,500
Wow, you're totally nuts.

411
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,480
Yeah, I know I'm crazy, but...

412
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,030
everything bothers me.

413
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,600
I understand.

414
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:38,160
Imagining someone I like being with someone else... Geez.

415
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,590
It really sucks.

416
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,420
But will you give up without telling her?

417
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,550
What if I tell her and get dumped?

418
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,000
What if we can't even stay friends? Will you take responsibility?

419
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,350
You said you think of her as a woman. You're already not friends.

420
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,330
Look. Let's say you stay friends with her.

421
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,570
Then you'd have to continue to see her dating.

422
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,440
Would you be able to?

423
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,990
- I can't. 
 - I knew it.

424
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,830
You're no longer friends with her, then.

425
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,810
You're the one who shouldn't regret it later. Go talk to her.

426
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,640
You said it's better to do it and regret it.

427
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,050
 He's right. If there's no right answer anyway, 

428
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,060
 I decided to be honest with my feelings. 

429
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,270
 That way, I won't have regrets. 

430
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,940
Yes.

431
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,180
 Where are you? 

432
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,780
Me? I'm dropping my students off.

433
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,680
 Okay. 

434
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,310
What?

435
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:56,440
It's Wu Ram's turn to get off.

436
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,600
Wu Ram's dad is here today.

437
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,360
Sir.

438
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,580
I knew you'd do this.

439
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,260
What? What do you mean?

440
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,670
You paid a lot for sushi last time.

441
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,770
You should've just let me treat you then.

442
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,980
I don't have money. Deal with it.

443
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,030
It's not like that.

444
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,150
I'm treating you today.

445
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,560
What? What are you plotting this time?

446
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,200
Your clothes look new.

447
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,320
Looks like you got your hair done too.

448
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,300
By chance...

449
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,740
did you make money with crypto?

450
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,170
Never mind.

451
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,610
This is a place to come with a boyfriend.

452
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,190
Hey. Who drinks wine like that?

453
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,350
Hye Ryeong.

454
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,200
- Say something if you call me. 
 - Yes, okay.

455
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,700
Well...

456
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,300
The thing is...

457
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,360
I like...

458
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,610
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you, guys.

459
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,780
 What? Is she that moved by what I said? 

460
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,130
Sorry. I couldn't hear you because of the party popper. What did you say?

461
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,710
You couldn't hear it?

462
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,130
No. What did you say?

463
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,340
Well, the thing is...

464
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,650
What I was t-trying to say is...

465
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,450
I...

466
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,840
I was going to ask if something was going on.

467
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,370
You looked upset.

468
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,110
Yes.

469
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,010
Can you tell?

470
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,160
To be honest...

471
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,350
I broke up with Eun Wu.

472
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,560
What?

473
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,340
Geez, I'm embarrassed because I bragged too much to the guys.

474
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,690
Why? Why did you break up?

475
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,640
I suddenly couldn't reach him.

476
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,390
Did he ghost you?

477
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:16,570
Geez, I knew he was too good-looking.

478
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,520
Hey, what did I tell you?

479
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,940
I told you not to date someone because of their looks. I said that many times.

480
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,060
No.

481
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,430
It's not that.

482
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,960
Don't laugh.

483
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,190
He joined the military.

484
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,010
Sorry, sorry.

485
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,920
Don't laugh, I said.

486
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,160
I was really hurt by it.

487
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,010
Geez.

488
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:07,540
It might sound silly since we only dated for a short while.

489
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,990
But I really liked him.

490
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,840
Bastard.

491
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,630
He should've given me a hint, at least.

492
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,200
How could it end like this?

493
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,230
Hye Ryeong.

494
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,480
Do you want some of my steak?

495
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,090
You like stealing my food.

496
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,570
Do you want some?

497
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,440
Here.

498
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,230
Have some.

499
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,300
Thank you for keeping me company today.

500
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:05,530
I couldn't reach out since I didn't want the guys to ask me about Eun Wu.

501
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:11,500
But it was pretty neat that you showed up.

502
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,850
Just go ahead and eat.

503
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,220
I should. I'm hungry.

504
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:30,360
To be honest, I pretended I ate little when I dated him.

505
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,000
So I always had a second meal at home.

506
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,160
But it's nice feeling relaxed with you.

507
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,170
You'll be my friend forever, okay?

508
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,560
You'd better not betray me.

509
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:53,000
 Seeing her being genuinely grateful to me for comforting her, I finally realized my position. 

510
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,410
 Yes. At least, for now... 

511
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,860
Hey, Hye Ryeong.

512
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,260
What is it?

513
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,130
Try not to cry if you can help it.

514
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,350
Why?

515
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,650
Well, it's because...

516
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:14,360
You aren't all that pretty, to begin with,

517
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,240
but you look even uglier when you cry.

518
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,650
Seriously. I'll kill you.

519
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:23,180
I'll send it to everyone. I'll tell them Kim Hye Ryeong is crying after getting dumped.

520
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,370
Give that to me!

521
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,020
Delete it.

522
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,100
Delete it. Give it to me. Give it to me.

523
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,160
 I should hide my feelings for now. 

524
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,370
 As long as we remain friends, 

525
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:41,890
 I'll surely find better timing. 

526
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,370
I should die...

527
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,960
Are you okay?

528
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,810
No.

529
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:05,720
Sure. Why would you be okay?

530
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,120
Is it normally like this?

531
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:14,520
My heart really aches and sores.

532
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,380
Oh Fatty, you're all grown up now.

533
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,300
You know what it's like to be heartbroken now.

534
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,980
Do you feel the same?

535
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:30,190
Why ask? Cheers.

536
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,930
- Hey, Jeong Hyeon Seong. 
 - Yeah?

537
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,850
You really didn't tell anyone, right?

538
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:50,800
Hey, a true friend is supposed to keep the secret until death.

539
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,670
Geez. I'm touched.

540
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,330
Oh Fatty confessed his love?

541
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,340
Geez, it's okay, man.

542
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,110
You mature as you get dumped.

543
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:06,050
Why do I even bother?

544
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:09,040
Why did you take a shower in the middle of the night?

545
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,500
We adults have our own world you don't know about.

546
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,130
It's not the adults' world. It's more like the gross world.

547
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,190
Hey, cheers.

548
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,670
- Hyeon Seong. 
 - Yes?

549
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,780
Will you just pile them up like that?

550
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,250
Shouldn't you take them out and sell them?

551
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:30,170
Hey. Don't you know he's nothing but pride?

552
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,940
He'd rather die than sell clothes out on the streets.

553
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,060
I'm sure he'd die from starving.

554
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,060
Hey. It's not like that. Don't you know me?

555
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,200
I do. You're broke.

556
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,870
Seriously.

557
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,800
This is no good. Let's go out. It's my treat.

558
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,970
Hey, hey. Forget it. We aren't going anywhere.

559
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,790
You don't have money. Don't try to show off.

560
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,770
Come on. I have money.

561
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,150
I have money, I said.

562
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,670
Order whatever you want.

563
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,160
- Wow. 
 - Here.

564
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,730
- Give me that. 
 - Okay.

565
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:03,150
I'll have...

566
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,500
everything from here to here.

567
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,220
Extra fishcake soup and seafood pancakes, too.

568
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,250
Hey. What kind of friend are you?

569
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,060
Don't you know how to do things moderately?

570
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,020
Okay. Why are you getting angry?

571
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:18,120
Hey. Oh Fatty doesn't know how to be moderate with food. I'll order.

572
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,840
Order one dish for now. It's not good to waste food.

573
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,710
One dish per person? One dish per person.

574
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,440
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes.

575
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:31,500
What? You work here, Bu Ri?

576
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,030
When did you come? I didn't see you.

577
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,510
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

578
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,040
You met him once. It's...

579
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,770
Anyway, it's Bu Ri. Bu Ri.

580
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,020
Yes, of course.

581
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,570
You didn't come with your girlfriend this time.

582
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:48,190
What are you saying?

583
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,540
Just take the order.

584
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,670
We broke up.

585
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,270
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

586
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:58,640
It's okay. You shouldn't apologize.

587
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,580
Couples break up all the time.

588
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,710
It's okay.

589
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,970
Are you going somewhere?

590
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:14,900
I'll go get some fresh air.

591
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,670
Okay.

592
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,540
   

593
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:42,380
   

594
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:47,110
Hey, Geon Yeop.

595
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,920
Yes.

596
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:55,140
Can we meet up for a second? I need to tell you something.

597
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,770
Right. Did you hear Hye Ryeong broke up with her boyfriend?

598
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,150
I guess it's the breakup season.

599
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,530
Yes. I heard.

600
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:07,090
We should grab drinks to celebrate Hye Ryeong's breakup. Let's set it up.

601
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:08,940
What do you mean, celebrate?

602
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,240
What? She acted like they'd last forever. We should make fun of her.

603
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,090
Is it fun to tease people for stuff like that?

604
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:17,600
Why are you being so serious?

605
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,510
You used to enjoy this the most.

606
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:23,080
Shut up. Just pee.

607
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:30,820
To be honest, I saw something recently.

608
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,140
See what?

609
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,490
Should I say it's a relief?

610
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,430
I saw Hyeon Seong's girlfriend recently.

611
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:41,450
I didn't know what to do, since I thought they were still dating.

612
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,440
What happened?

613
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,700
You know the Shinjung motel district, right?

614
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,830
Yeah, I know.

615
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,220
I saw her there.

616
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,140
What?

617
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,870
With whom?

618
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,110
- Pardon? 
 - Who was she with?

619
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:01,110
I'm just asking out of curiosity. I'm totally fine.

620
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:02,760
Well...

621
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,660
- Who was she with, anyway? 
 - Pardon?

622
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,600
- A man? 
 - Yes. What?

623
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,970
Geez. I didn't know he was in there.

624
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,460
Seriously.

625
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,350
What did he look like?

626
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,660
Well, the thing is...

627
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,840
Thinking about it now, I think I was mistaken.

628
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,020
I can't see so well at night.

629
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,950
Oh, really?

630
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:34,250
I was just curious.

631
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,070
By the way,

632
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,800
- are you still peeing? 
 - Yeah...

633
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,330
He's so scary.

634
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,430
 - Which college Hubae? 
 - Well, there's one you don't know. 

635
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:00,070
 Which Hubae that I don't know? 

636
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:02,960
 What are you doing right now? 

637
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,460
 Son Yong Min! Son Yong Min! 

638
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,770
 Son Yong Min! Son Yong Min! 

639
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:26,440
 You know the Shinjung motel district, right? I saw her there. 

640
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,230
   

641
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,430
Hey, what are you still doing out here?

642
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:36,640
Han Seong Ok, how could you...

643
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,720
Seong Ok? What about her?

644
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:43,970
- Hey, follow me. 
 - What? What? What is it?

645
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:46,000
I guess Seong Ok went to a motel with another man.

646
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,850
Geez. He goes crazy if he's angry.

647
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:51,170
Hey, Jeong Hyeon Seong! Hey!

648
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,570
What did you want to tell me?

649
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,570
Geon Yeop.

650
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,370
What...

651
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:32,460
do you think of me?

652
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:42,860


653
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:49,010
   

654
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,370
   

655
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:02,620
♫  We were stars in the midnight sky  ♫

656
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,330
♫  We were shining brighter  ♫

657
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:08,210
 Should I try selling them cheap somewhere? 

658
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,720
 What would the potential customers think, then? 

659
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,390
 We can't. 

660
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,940
 All you do is drink since you broke up. 

661
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,600
 You do nothing else! 

662
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,110
 Can't you live properly for Seong Ok? 

663
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:21,680
 Street fashion brand, H2 is having a season sale. 

664
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,350
 Are you still interested in working part-time? 

665
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:24,730
 You should've done this sooner. 

666
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:27,310
 If you did, Seong Ok would've... 

667
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:31,370
 Things might've been different if I had done this sooner, as you suggested. 

668
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,680
 Han Seong Ok. 

669
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,670
 I can't break up with you like this. 

670
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,320
 Do you really believe in love? 

671
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,710
 Women give up on love too easily when faced with reality. 

672
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,810
 Hey, An Si Hu. 

673
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,670
 You don't have to act tough in front of me. 

674
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,150
 At least pretend you're listening when I talk. 

675
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:48,110
 I'm listening. 

676
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:51,180
 If you broke up, it's over. Why keep calling each other? 

677
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,910
 Did you meet him, Yun Yu Ju? 

678
00:53:53,910 --> 00:54:00,340
 Should we quit doing this and start a relationship? 

679
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,640
 I won't hurt you like last time. I'll be good to you. 

680
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,340
 I'll be good to you. I will. 

681
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:09,640
 I'll be good from now on and do as you say, Nuna.
