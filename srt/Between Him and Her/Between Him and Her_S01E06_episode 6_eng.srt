1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,500
   

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,520
   

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,180
Hey, could it be...

4
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,790
- Kim Hyeong Seop? 
 - Kim Hyeong Seop?

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:46,760


6
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,950
Hey, what exactly is going on?

7
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,760
I don't know, either.

8
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,390
Is something going on with you?

9
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,010
Yes.

10
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,240
Something really shitty.

11
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,180
What's going on?

12
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,290
I heard somewhere that...

13
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,580
Seong Ok was with another man.

14
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,090
Hey, he said he was mistaken.

15
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,040
I was so pissed.

16
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,150
I wonder who that was.

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,650
I kept wondering who that was

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,990
and it turns out that bastard...

19
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,850
hung out with me, pretending to be my friend all along.

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,110
What's with you?

21
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,370
Did you meet Seong Ok?

22
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,330
Is there a reason I shouldn't?

23
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,050
- Why do you care who she sees— 
 - You bastard!

24
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,350
Hey, Jeong Hyeon Seong!

25
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,150
I dated her for seven years.

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,310
Do you know what that means?

27
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,250
A punk like you can't just get in between us, okay?

28
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,180
Hey...

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,610
What a loser.

30
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,790
No matter how long you dated, it's over once you break up.

31
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,530
Do you think she's yours?

32
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,780
You bastard!

33
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,630
Hey, hey!

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,070
Hey, just talk. Just talk.

35
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,500
This bastard is crazy.

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,090
It must be a misunderstanding.

37
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,180
Hey, Kim Hyeong Seop. Go ahead and explain yourself.

38
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,390
Yes, I met Seong Ok.

39
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,690
You bastard.

40
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,830
- What did you say? 
 - Hey, did you...

41
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,180
lose your mind after being single for 29 years?

42
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,450
Seong Ok is my friend, too.

43
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,000
You might've broke up with her, but I didn't.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,760
She's still a good friend I don't want to lose.

45
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,440
But I feel bad for her seeing you acting like this.

46
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,240
- What? 
 - The fact that you're doing this to me

47
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,230
means you can't trust Seong Ok.

48
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,250
You dated her for seven years, as you said.

49
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,960
Don't you feel bad for her that you still doubt her like this?

50
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,080
And do you realize how you look?

51
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,260
All you do is drink just because you broke up. You don't do anything else.

52
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,660
Get it together, Jeong Hyeon Seong.

53
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,270
Do you know what she's been doing since she broke up with you?

54
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:25,190
She's back into designing. Something she couldn't do while she was with you.

55
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,300
But you...

56
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,130
Can't you live properly for her sake?

57
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,800
Huh?

58
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,200
How long will you keep living like a loser?

59
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,860
Is the old Jeong Hyeon Seong dead or something?

60
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,810
So annoying.

61
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,850
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,230
You must be having a hard time.

63
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,510
I was too cruel, wasn't I?

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,690
No, I'm sorry.

65
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,150
Get back to your cool self. I know you're cool.

66
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,700
Hyeong Seop! I'll be better.

67
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,400
Hao. Hao.

68
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,560
That's a true friendship.

69
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,520
Hao. Hao.

70
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,730
You're heavy.

71
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,530
What did you want to tell me?

72
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,660
Is something going on?

73
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,800
Geon Yeop, what do you think of me?

74
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,280
Pardon?

75
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,090
Why do you suddenly ask that?

76
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,840
I want to...

77
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,920
focus on nothing but work for now.

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,940
So if you're thinking of me differently by chance,

79
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,520
it might be a bit difficult for me to work with you.

80
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,750
Come on, Nuna. Why would you say that so seriously?

81
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,640
I reached out because we really needed a designer. I swear it's not like that.

82
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,500
What's this? Are you the one with an ulterior motive?

83
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,150
I said, by chance. By chance.

84
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,350
Okay. Let's say you don't.

85
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,500
But you're serious about wanting to focus on work for now, right?

86
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,090
Yes.

87
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,610
- Let's make this work. 
 - Sounds good.

88
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,020
   

89
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,280
 Hyeong Seop and Seong Ok? 

90
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,010
What a funny pair.

91
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,720
Gosh, Jeong Hyeon Seong. You pretended to be okay, but you're still out of it.

92
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,150
I know.

93
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,800
How could you even think that?

94
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,000
What a ridiculous thing to say.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,520
Hyeong Seop, you shouldn't dwell on what happened today, either.

96
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,510
You know he's totally crazy these days.

97
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,790
Let's raise glasses, except for Hyeon Seong.

98
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,540
He'd better stop drinking.

99
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,440
Hey.

100
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,420
Please call Seong Ok for me.

101
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,720
Why are you doing this? What for?

102
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,050
Please call her.

103
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,530
Tell her I'm drunk.

104
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,670
You're not drinking anymore.

105
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,570
Tell her I'm not doing so well and...

106
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,110
tell her all I ever do is drink too.

107
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,100
It's not like she would suddenly do something if that happened.

108
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,630
The Seong Ok I know...

109
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,510
would come running.

110
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,900
And...

111
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,960
she'll nag me for...

112
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,500
drinking too much, too.

113
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,140
That's enough. You'd be doing her a favor by doing well.

114
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,360
Yes, you should stop now.

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,190
No.

116
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,520
Hey, do whatever you want to do.

117
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,660
So you have no regrets.

118
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,450
Let's drink.

119
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,760
We cheer for you.

120
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,560
Yes.

121
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,910
Oppa.

122
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,740
Why are you so drunk?

123
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,850
Did you drink a lot?

124
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,690
What am I doing...

125
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,320
 Han Seong Ok. 

126
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,140
 I can't break up with you like this. 

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,800
   

128
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,100
 I no longer need alcohol anymore. 

129
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,270
Si Hu.

130
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,890
Should we quit doing this...

131
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,460
and start a relationship?

132
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,510
Like we did once.

133
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,320
I'll be good to you.

134
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,380
I won't hurt you like I did before.

135
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,300
   

136
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,980
You don't have to worry, I said.

137
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,660
He's just an old man.

138
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,010
But he's still a man. You were going to meet a man privately.

139
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,670
I thought it was a woman since you always called him a "Seonbae."

140
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,280
Are you upset?

141
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,990
I'm angry, okay?

142
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,170
I'm sorry. That's why we're here together.

143
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,140
You would've come alone if I didn't ask you.

144
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,360
- Seonbae. 
 - Yu Ju, long time no see.

145
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,890
- Who's this? 
 - Well...

146
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,520
I'm her boyfriend.

147
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,570
Oh, boyfriend? Yes. Nice to meet you.

148
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,010
Yes, hello.

149
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,840
Hello.

150
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,590
You probably won't drink since you drove here.

151
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,600
It feels silly to call a driver too.

152
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,990
But it's been so long. You don't even want one glass?

153
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,010
Can't your boyfriend drive for you?

154
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,090
I don't have a driver's license.

155
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,120
Oh, really?

156
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,760
Well, it's easier if you don't have to drive.

157
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,530
You don't mind me talking to you casually, right?

158
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,860
Sure, go ahead.

159
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,620
Geezer.

160
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,490
You probably don't know a lot about tuna.

161
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,610
Start with the belly. That's the most expensive part.

162
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,080
Eating tuna requires knowledge too.

163
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,250
You can't appreciate it if you're ignorant.

164
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,630
Tuna is...

165
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,960
You go ahead and eat, Seonbae.

166
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,740
Let's eat.

167
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,160
 It's so annoyingly tasty. 

168
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,670
How's work? Is it okay? How is it?

169
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,710
I'm still trying to keep up, you know.

170
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,740
I thought there would be a curriculum at the company.

171
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,900
I didn't know there would be so many things to learn by myself.

172
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,030
That's just how it is.

173
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,780
That's why it's important to train yourself before joining a company.

174
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,260
But no one expects a junior employee to deliver results.

175
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,950
So don't feel so stressed.

176
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,390
I wish I could work with you.

177
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,510
Would I be able to transfer to your company later?

178
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,180
I'll recommend you as soon as a position opens. Just be ready.

179
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,930
Really? You promised, okay?

180
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,410
I'll work hard on keeping a good reputation too—

181
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,730
What?

182
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,950
Yu Ju's boyfriend, how old are you?

183
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,650
I'm 23 years old.

184
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,060
Twenty-three?

185
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,240
- Yes. 
 - Hold on. Are you...

186
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
six years older than him?

187
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,700
What? Were you into young men?

188
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,610
Well...

189
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,330
Don't you think it's a waste of your youth to date an older woman?

190
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,490
No, not really.

191
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,590
Shouldn't you let him go if you have any conscience?

192
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,350
He's so young.

193
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,710
Don't be like that.

194
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,220
By the way, what's the name of this place?

195
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,210
I want to come back with my friends.

196
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,170
This place? This is a really expensive place.

197
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,740
Pardon?

198
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,200
What's wrong with wanting to come back with friends?

199
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,450
You can come when your mom gives you a lot of pocket money.

200
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,040
Where did you do military service?

201
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,010
I did public service.

202
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,760
Really? Why?

203
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,130
Because of a spinal disc.

204
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,590
You have to do active duty to become a real man. Especially...

205
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,690
immature kids tend to come out mature.

206
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,340
Drink slowly. You'll get drunk.

207
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,730
Dongsaeng, aren't you overdoing it? Drink slowly.

208
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,730
You make a lot of mistakes, not knowing how much liquor you can handle at your age.

209
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,040
Don't worry. I know how much I can handle.

210
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,170
What you guys mean by "handle" means getting totally drunk.

211
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,160
You don't know how to control yourself when you're young.

212
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,740
Oh, yes, yes.

213
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,600
When an older person is talking to you,

214
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,700
- at least pretend to listen. 
 - I'm listening.

215
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,320
Is that so?

216
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,480
What's with those eyes, then?

217
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,200
Pardon?

218
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,400
- Seonbae, what are you doing? 
 - Hold on.

219
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,030
You said you were listening,

220
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,300
but why did you have to give me an annoyed look?

221
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,010
Si Hu.

222
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,660
Yun Yu Ju, your boyfriend must really dislike me.

223
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,780
I'm sorry, but I don't think you're exactly innocent.

224
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,450
Si Hu.

225
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,930
Are you very angry?

226
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,810
I want to punch that bastard.

227
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,720
That's why I said I'll come alone.

228
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,440
What?

229
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,310
It's not that...

230
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,280
What a crazy bastard.

231
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,880
He must've looked down on me because I'm young.

232
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,640
But he's still older than you. You're taking it too far.

233
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,770
How about him acting that way at his age?

234
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,230
Why do I have to be looked down on by that geezer?

235
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,360
I'm sure he didn't have bad intentions.

236
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,730
Why don't you just—

237
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,970
Shit.

238
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,950
   

239
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,260
You said it'd be ready today.

240
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,510
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

241
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,570
The bookbinding company missed the deadline.

242
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:18,250
I asked you to keep checking on it.

243
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,460
I'll get it to you as soon as possible.

244
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,220
I don't need "as soon as possible." It has to be today.

245
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,390
What am I supposed to do about it?

246
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,180
Geez, I'm about to lose it.

247
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,860
 Jeong Hyeon Seong is on vacation. 

248
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,470
 Hurry up and come if you want to see him. 

249
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,660
Hey, Min Hyeok. Is everyone coming?

250
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,760
That's great. I need your help.

251
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,790
I'll tell you when I get there.

252
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,040
 Are you sleeping? I'm having a hard time...  
     

253
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,050
 Isn't this funny? My friend is walking around in his military uniform. 

254
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,370
 Yes. It's funny. 

255
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,540
 Have fun. 

256
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,240
Okay. Nuna isn't asleep yet.

257
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,710
I'll bring her out. You just need to say what I told you to.

258
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,360
Hey. Is that all you can say to a friend who came out to society in months?

259
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,240
Come on. Don't say it like that.

260
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,210
Protecting the country isn't the only work that matters.

261
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,990
What's more honorable than protecting your friend's love?

262
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,300
- Salut. 
 - Geez...

263
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,670
Hey, just leave him alone.

264
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,290
He's totally crazy about that Nuna right now.

265
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,960
Let's protect his love too.

266
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,580
I'm a little worried about this.

267
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,870
Hey, don't worry. Okay.

268
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,600
Let's do this. Cheers!

269
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,960
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers!

270
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,860
- Why would I? 
 - Don't you kind of like it?

271
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,400
 I thought I knew Nuna better than anyone. 

272
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,620
- This is great. 
 - We should've bought more green ones.

273
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,490
No, no. Put more over there.

274
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,330
- Hey, it's not bad, right? 
 - I'm not sure. I said we should get more colors—

275
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,950
Hey, hey. She's here. She's here. Hide. Hide.

276
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,080
The sign. You remember the sign, right?

277
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,720
Geez, that one. Oh, no...

278
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,270
Hide, hide, hide.

279
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,900
Nuna.

280
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,650
What are you doing? Come here.

281
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,790
Take this.

282
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,430
You're embarrassing me. Take it.

283
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,550
What's all this, by the way?

284
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,790
Huh? Don't you know what today is?

285
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,170
Come on. Did you forget?

286
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,140
Yes. Just tell me.

287
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,590
Today is our 300th day together.

288
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,880
Thank you.

289
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,690
Don't mention it.

290
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,210
Why don't we talk at home?

291
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,720
Hold on.

292
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,110
Close your eyes for a second.

293
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,910
- Come out. 
 - Hurry, hurry, hurry.

What's with this?

302
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,980
 I thought my love was the same as hers. 

303
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,210
That punk. He looks happy, right?

304
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,040
I have a bad feeling about this.

305
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,990
Why? Didn't it go well?

306
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,360
When will they be done, anyway?

307
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,900
But my love was different from hers.

308
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,530
Say that again.

309
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,190
We should stop seeing each other.

310
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,490
I'm sorry for saying this on a day like this, but...

311
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,810
I don't think I should delay it, either.

312
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,200
Well, what do you mean by that?

313
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,320
You're joking right now, right?

314
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,140
Don't do stuff like this. It's not funny.

315
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,640
No, I mean it.

316
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:42,360
I thought the age difference wouldn't matter if we loved each other,

317
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,570
but I guess I'm too realistic for that.

318
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:53,480
I should've told you sooner.

319
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,890
Why are you suddenly doing this?

320
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,270
Did I do something wrong?

321
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,650
No, no, no.

322
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,400
I'll be good to you. I will.

323
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,040
I won't do anything wrong and never do what you don't want me to do.

324
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,370
I'll do what you want me to do. Please?

325
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,420
I'm sorry, Si Hu.

326
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:24,850
I'm so busy that I don't feel like going on dates like before.

327
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,380
Nuna, please.

328
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,490
I'll get going.

329
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,270
- Hey! 
 - Geez.

330
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,260
Hey, how did it go? Is she coming later?

331
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,840
No.

332
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,810
Right, she's an office worker. She must be tired.

333
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,160
Are you sure it went well?

334
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,630
Yes. Thanks for helping me.

335
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,210
- Gosh, don't mention it. 
 - Congrats.

336
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,720
Let's put this away and go get a drink.

337
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,220
Yes, yes. Let's clean up. Hurry, hurry.

338
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,580
Let's drink, everyone!

339
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,010
Let's drink. I don't have a lot of time left out here.

340
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,820
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers, cheers, cheers.

341
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,940
Wow, Si Hu is sad because his friend is leaving.

342
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,870
I'll come out again soon, Si Hu. Don't worry.

343
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,890
Gosh, you scared me. What's wrong with you?

344
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,970
She pinched me.

345
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,030
What?

346
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,590
Just be quiet.

347
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,240
What did I do wrong?

348
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,870
I'll go to the restroom real quick.

349
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,670
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to... 
   

350
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,710
   

351
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,600
   

352
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,710
   

353
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:48,410
♫  I think of you every time I take a step  ♫

354
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,610
♫  I keep slowing down  ♫

355
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,680
   

356
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:03,100
♫  With my broken shoelaces  ♫

357
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:11,810
♫  I stare at the sky that changed me  ♫

358
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:15,430
   

359
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:19,800
   

360
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:27,310
♫  So we could remember our old laughter  ♫

361
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:31,800
 To be honest, I already sensed it a while back. 

362
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,250
   

363
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,420
 You'd be a fool not to notice she couldn't rely on me 

364
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:48,150
 whenever she was having a hard time because of the age difference. 

365
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,660
 But... 

366
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,920
 at the time... 

367
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,930
 I wanted to believe she loved me as much as I loved her. 

368
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,370
 I mustered up the courage a little too late 

369
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:11,000
 but I wanted to let her know, even if it was really over. 

370
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,200
♫  Right here, where I was hurt  ♫

371
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:23,020
♫  I would like to start again if only I could  ♫

372
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:38,970
 Maybe... I thought maybe I could change her mind. 

373
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,390
 Hello? 

374
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,710
Nuna, I'm in front of your place right now.

375
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,940
 Hey, you bastard! 

376
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,690
 If you broke up, it's over. Why keep calling her? 

377
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,930
 - Don't do that, Oppa. Give it to me. 
 - Let go. 

378
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,560
 Yu Ju is my girlfriend now. 

379
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,900
 You'd better not call her. 

380
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,600
 I won't just warn you verbally next time. 

381
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,750
 What a clueless kid. 

382
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,820
 Hang up, you bastard. 

383
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Seriously, why are you doing this?

384
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,930
Is any of what I said wrong?

385
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:15,440
You have to make these things clear. Otherwise, he'll—

386
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,810
I could've made him understand.

387
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,120
You think he'd stop...

388
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,220
if you talked to him?

389
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,660
This won't happen anymore.

390
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,270
   

391
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,270
   

392
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,080
 That day... 

393
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,920
 my love... 

394
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,120
 died. 

395
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,400
   

396
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,370
What the hell are you talking about?

397
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,260
Hey.

398
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,350
You think I'm a pushover, don't you?

399
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,450
You want to get back together again?

400
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,890
Why would I do that?

401
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,970
Because of this? Because we slept together?

402
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,110
Give me a break.

403
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,230
Both of us needed someone because we were lonely. Am I wrong?

404
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,890
Do you think I'm easy because I always accept you and sleep with you?

405
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,510
You and I are nothing more than this.

406
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,330
Don't read into it all by yourself.

407
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,380
Don't ever call me again.

408
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,780
 It's over. 

409
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,410
   

410
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:31,270
 I rejected someone so sweet and 

411
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,370
 I ended up being left with nothing. 

412
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,540
 Why did Si Hu agree to see me again? 

413
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,670
   

414
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,500
 I've been hoping for this desperately. Why... 

415
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,060
 do I not feel satisfied at all? 

416
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,070
Why?

417
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,200
Why...

418
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,020
Why did you show up in front of me?

419
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,150
Why?

420
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,210
What made you clean all of a sudden?

421
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,690
Do it later and come here.

422
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,390
I quit drinking.

423
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,300
Hey. A dog doesn't quit eating poop.

424
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,750
I'm really not going to drink.

425
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,430
Let's see how long you last.

426
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,060
What are you doing with that, by the way?

427
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,630
Will you really sell it out on the street?

428
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,870
No. I wanted to tidy things up for now.

429
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,920
Right?

430
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,840
Jeong Hyeon Seong wouldn't sell clothes on the streets just because it's a street fashion.

431
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,600
Hey.

432
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,470
How do delivery gigs work?

433
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,240
Will you do it? You?

434
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,470
Why? Can't I?

435
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:05,490
They say if someone suddenly changes, they're about to die.

436
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,660
I should change.

437
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,310
I can't keep living like before.

438
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,270
Oh, right. Did I tell you I got someone's number recently?

439
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,970
- No. 
 - Wow.

440
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,140
She's totally into me.

441
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,900
She says I'm the only one, and she loves me. It's crazy.

442
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,710
But what's really funny is someone called her once

443
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,140
and it clearly said, "boyfriend."

444
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,280
- And? 
 - What do you mean, and?

445
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,510
I slept with her once, and that was it.

446
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,190
But she still calls me to this day.

447
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:37,590
By the way, isn't it time for you to find proper love?

448
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,400
Love?

449
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,540
Hyeon Seong, do you think love actually exists?

450
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,560
It's nothing but a made-up concept.

451
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:53,740
Listen. If they called love "breakup," in the beginning, that would be a proper name for it.

452
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,630
So I break up with you.

453
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,710
What nonsense is that?

454
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,380
I'm saying love is pointless.

455
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,410
Women give up on love too easily when faced with reality.

456
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,920
Love means money to women, doesn't it?

457
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,160
It's the same with Seong Ok...

458
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,910
- Hey, An Si Hu. 
 - Gosh, I'm sorry.

459
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:21,110
I crossed the line. What's wrong with me? I must be drunk.

460
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,400
You don't have to act tough in front of me.

461
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:32,840
I know you were sincerer than anyone toward love.

462
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,410
Reality?

463
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,490
It matters.

464
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,970
But...

465
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,700
do you think reality is the only reason love fizzled out?

466
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,660
Is something going on?

467
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,210
I met her.

468
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,040
Yun Yu Ju.

469
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:14,560
This is my last glass before I quit.

470
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,750
Think of it as an honor.

471
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,140
Okay.

472
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,370
It's an honor.

473
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,370
   

474
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,170
Hey, what's up?

475
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,870
 Are you still interested in a part-time job? 

476
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,490
Huh? What is it?

477
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,460
This is why design majors are superior.

478
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,760
Hao. Hao.

479
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,470
I studied fashion design.

480
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,980
Whether you dress people or shrimp, it's all design.

481
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,540
Dress it up so it looks more tasty.

482
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,640
- Like this? 
 - Yes, yes. A little more. A little more. Yes.

483
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,760
Wow, you're good.

484
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,270
Doesn't this make the shrimp pop too much on its own?

485
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,730
It's good to make the shrimp pop.

486
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,770
It'd make people want to eat it. Don't you think?

487
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:22,220
- If then— 
 - Yes. A little more. A little more.

488
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,050
- I'll do this, then. 
 - Hao. Hao.

489
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,370
That's great.

490
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,280
Go ahead and finish it up.

491
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,130
I'll go get the next dish, then.

492
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,720
- Okay. 
 - You're good.

493
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,710
Is this okay?

494
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,990
I'm not sure.

495
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,200
Uncle Chef!

496
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,360
The shrimp looks like it's bleeding.

497
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,670
Is this okay?

498
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,750
Do you think it is? Go back to the old version. What were you thinking?

499
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,340
I just did what he told me to do.

500
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,740
Was it doable?

501
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,330
Yes. Not too bad. I liked it.

502
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:10,060
I felt less tired because we did it together.

503
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,700
Do you want to join me next time, too?

504
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,480
Sounds good. I'll work hard.

505
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,100
Hey, why didn't you do this sooner?

506
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,210
If so, Seong Ok...

507
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,530
S-Seong Ok...

508
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,070
Seong Ok... She would've liked it if she saw you...

509
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,790
working hard like this.

510
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,170
And doing well. It's... It's a good thing.

511
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,700
So, I mean...

512
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,150
Y-You know what I mean, right?

513
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,320
Don't get me wrong.

514
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,890
I know, you bastard.

515
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,850
As you said, if I did this sooner,

516
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,430
things might've been different.

517
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,330
What?

518
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,670
It's nothing.

519
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,810
I'm just happy.

520
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,410
Let's go. I'll treat you to a bowl of soup.

521
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,410
What's gotten into you?

522
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,690
The more experienced employee usually treats the new one. It was your first day.

523
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,500
What kind of soup?

524
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,450
Pork soup.

525
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,660
I want sundae soup.

526
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,790
Sundae soup. You got it.

527
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,430
Let's go.

528
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,030
   

529
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,110
   

530
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,400
   

531
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,460
- Yes, Sir. 
  - Why aren't you paying me for the fabric? 

532
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,380
Right. Please wait just a few days.

533
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,100
I'm working hard to put it together.

534
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,740
 You already asked me to wait many times. 

535
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,850
 What happened to the female owner? 

536
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:51,050
 You had no outstanding payments when she was around. 

537
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:54,400
Well, there's a bit of a situation.

538
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,910
 I don't know. Whatever. Transfer the payment soon. 

539
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,290
Please wait just a bit.

540
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,650
 Send it soon. 

541
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,570
Yes, thank you.

542
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,870
 The textile shop on the 21st. The sewing factory on the 23rd. Don't forget. 

543
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,200
 Really? 

544
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,200
 Can we push it back a few days? 

545
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,210
 Should I try selling it for cheap outside? 

546
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,750
 You can't. 

547
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,700
 What would the current customers think? 

548
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,070
 But we need to try something. 

549
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,820
 No. 

550
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,700
   

551
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,170
I told you not to come. Why did you come?

552
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,890
I was running an errand nearby.

553
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,180
I'm a merchandiser. I do everything.

554
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,880
I'm okay. You don't have to worry.

555
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,360
- But still. 
 - You can work extra hard, then.

556
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:28,930
How much are you planning to exploit me later?

557
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,390
Let's get some coffee nearby, then.

558
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:34,010
You must be tired. Shouldn't you rest inside?

559
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,940
No. I'd feel bad if you just leave.

560
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,240
It's nearby.

561
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,190
I'd like to stop by before I leave, too.

562
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:42,290
Sounds good. You want to take my car?

563
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,950
Okay.

564
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:09,690
Street fashion brand H2 is having a season sale. 
    

565
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:17,720
Street fashion brand H2 is having a season sale.

566
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,130
Feel free to browse...

567
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,770
Feel free to take a look.

568
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,640
Street fashion...

569
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,750
Feel free to check it out, guys.

570
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:40,020
Wow, it's so cute...

571
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,660
It looks amazing. You totally look like a rapper.

572
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,660
Come on. I'm not a rapper. I never made the cut.

573
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,680
And I'll quit rapping.

574
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,190
Fold it back.

575
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:56,160
What are you talking about? Who'd rap if you quit?

576
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,000
You're really impressive, okay?

577
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,620
Wear this for the audition.

578
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:04,010
- How much is this? 
 - It's 30,000 won  (~ $22). 

579
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,940
See? It's too expensive. Let's go.

580
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,750
I thought it was, but...

581
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,270
Upon double-checking, it's 10,000 won  (~ $7). 

582
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,730
- Really? 
 - Yes.

583
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,940
It's 10,000 won. Let's buy it.

584
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,740
We'll take this one.

585
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,440
Wearing this won't make me any better.

586
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,020
I said I don't want to.

587
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,860
And I don't have the confidence, either.

588
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,190
Well, excuse me...

589
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,560
- Yes? 
 - Well...

590
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,780
don't give up on your dream because of the standards created by others.

591
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,820
You're the only one...

592
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,960
who can make you give up. And..

593
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,940
having someone who has faith in you is an amazing thing.

594
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,550
If you can't believe in yourself, try believing in your girlfriend.

595
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,730
I'll wrap this up for you.

596
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,010
- He's giving them— 
 - You looked at this earlier, too.

597
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,690
Oh, yes.

598
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,910
You don't have to. Really.

599
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,950
Thank you.

600
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,340
Here you go.

601
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:38,130
And it's something you have already started.

602
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:40,340
Don't be afraid...

603
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,010
since you got started.

604
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,520
Thank you, Hyeong.

605
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,830
I won't give up.

606
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,870
Enjoy the clothes.

607
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,300
Thank you. We'll enjoy them.

608
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,160
- Take care. 
 - Thank you.

609
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,550
Let's not be afraid.

610
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,120
 Don't be afraid to get started. 

611
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,760
Street fashion brand H2 is having a season sale. Come check it out.

612

It's made with good fabric.

Street fashion brand H2 is having a season sale.

614

616
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,860
What's wrong, Nuna?

617

♫  Dark night sky, the stars are shining brightly  ♫

♫  With that mischievous smile of yours  ♫

624
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,360
 Women hate fat men, okay? 

625
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,290
 They probably hate short men more. 

626
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,020
 Do you want to see who's more popular? 

627
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,240
 Shall we? 

628
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,590
 What? Oh Fatty? 

629
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:38,310
 I wanted to see you for a second if you're outside. 

630
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,780
 There's a film you didn't pick up last time. 

631
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,080
 I'll do it. 

632
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,930
 I'll work really hard. 

633
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,060
 Do you like it? 

634
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,270
 Yes. 

635
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:50,860
 Hyeong, do you still think you're an artist? 

636
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,470
 You made a brand fail. You can't keep doing what you did then. 

637
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:58,260
 Team Leader Han changed the earrings, right? 

638
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,860
 What are you doing? 

639
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:02,950
 Do you know that woman? 

640
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:05,900
 Are you playing ignorant or enjoying it? 

641
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,040
 He likes you. 

642
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,090
 Only think about what I didn't like. 

643
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,470
 What I didn't like. 

644
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:16,200
 I'll get you one every anniversary. 

645
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:21,400
 Do you still think about Hyeon Seong Hyeong?
