=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,120
Wan'er! Wan'er!

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,600
What happened?

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,559
Miss!

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,120
Someone, help!

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,120
Miss!

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,000
You bunch of murderers!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,679
You poisoned her!

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,480
Miss.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,840
How could she be poisoned?

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,880
The food was brought in by you.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,520
If anyone poisoned her, it was you.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,679
It has nothing to do with us.

14
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:40,320
Alright.

15
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,320
You forced one daughter of mine
to jump into the river.

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,240
Now you forced my other daughter
to take poison.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,799
You bunch of murderers!

18
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,520
I'll kill you!

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,679
=Episode 23=

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,320
You crazy woman! What are you doing?

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,840
I'm taking my daughter away.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,960
If you try to stop me,

23
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,880
I'll die right here.

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,200
She's our family's daughter-in-law.
How could...

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,040
Enough. Let them go.

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,760
Let's leave quickly.

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,680
What just happened in Rong's mansion?

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,319
The new marquise got poisoned and died.

29
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,680
She died?

30
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,200
Miss, your wound...

31
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,519
It's nothing.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,840
Without the blood from this wound,

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,799
they wouldn't have believed

34
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,439
that I was really poisoned.

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,079
Madam, Master still hasn't returned.

36
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,840
I've asked the palace guards.

37
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,960
There's no news of the general
leaving the palace.

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,520
We can't wait any longer,
or the situation will change.

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,639
We must leave now.

40
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,879
You go south
and stay at my mother's house first.

41
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
I know you're worried about Yu,

42
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,800
but the Rong family
wouldn't harm a child.

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,599
Once the general returns,
he will surely take him back for you.

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,159
Quickly. Go.

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,039
Where are you going?

46
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,639
Wan'er?

47
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,080
Thanks to Miss Gong,

48
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,319
we were able
to catch up to you so quickly.

49
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,360
You ungrateful thing!

50
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,759
Mother, if this is exposed,

51
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,479
it will bring great disaster
to the Gong family.

52
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,199
I'm doing this for our family.

53
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,280
I'm not your mother.

54
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,000
Alright.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,280
Stop reminiscing, you two.

56
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,599
Today, our main target is the marquise.

57
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
Don't think about leaving alive.

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,439
Rong Xiu, how dare you
kill her in public?

59
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,680
Xue Wan'er died from taking poison
under many watchful eyes.

60
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,560
It was you who personally took her body
away from Rong's mansion.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
How can I kill someone
who's already dead?

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,280
You...

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,199
This matter should be put to an end.

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,400
As long as you're not dead,

65
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,400
I couldn't peacefully stay
in the Rong family.

66
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,879
Get her.

67
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,800
Rong Yan.

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,639
Wan'er,

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,439
I'm back.

70
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,680
You've finally come back.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,599
With me around,
you have nothing to fear.

72
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,439
General.

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,879
General, I'm your nephew.

74
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,879
Please spare my life.

75
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,279
I have said

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,399
that I have no relation

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,560
to the Rong family anymore.

78
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,720
Yu! Yu...

79
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,519
Please spare my life.

80
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,000
Yu is still in Rong's mansion.

81
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,808
(Rong's Mansion)

82
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,959
How dare you block the general's way!

83
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,319
They are from the palace.

84
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,720
General, you're back.

85
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,439
Some days ago,
the matriarch's birthday banquet

86
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,680
was dispersed early
due to some unfortunate circumstances.

87
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,639
The royal concubine
took pity on the matriarch

88
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,000
and came here
to celebrate her birthday in person.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,120
Quite a few nobles and their kins
have also arrived

90
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,399
out of respect for the matriarch.

91
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,439
So, isn't it inappropriate for you
to storm into the mansion

92
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,399
with the royal concubine
and others present?

93
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,199
Do you think that
by inviting these nobles here,

94
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,720
you can stop me?

95
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,680
Is Yu also at the banquet?

96
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,560
Madam, you are truly smart.

97
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,439
Yu is currently in the arms
of the royal concubine.

98
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,199
She likes him a lot

99
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,720
and plans to bring him back
to the palace to raise him herself.

100
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,639
Don't worry. I'm here.

101
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,160
You guys wait for me outside.

102
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,199
Yes, general.

103
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,720
I heard that the matriarch
once helped the royal concubine a lot

104
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,920
when she was in trouble.

105
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,160
The royal concubine came to the mansion
for the matriarch.

106
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,759
I'm afraid things
won't be so easy anymore.

107
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:28,360
If it weren't for the matriarch,
how would I get my honor today?

108
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,399
I'm flattered.

109
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,279
The matriarch is kind
and a role model for all of us.

110
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,480
Yes, she's our role model.

111
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,439
Greetings, Your Grace.

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,079
Yu, be good. Don't cry.

113
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,439
Are you the woman
who was married to the general?

114
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,839
Yes.

115
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,040
I have heard a lot of rumors about you.

116
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,759
A few days ago,
at the matriarch's birthday,

117
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:22,600
you made quite a scene, didn't you?

118
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,160
Why are you here again today?

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,480
Don't cause any trouble
that upsets the matriarch.

120
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,720
Madam, you should leave first.

121
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,000
Wait.

122
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,079
Your Grace,

123
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
three days ago,

124
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,839
you suggested to His Majesty

125
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,199
that I stay in the palace

126
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,480
and play chess and archery with him

127
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
for three days.

128
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,759
I made small talk with His Majesty.

129
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,319
Do you know what we talked about?

130
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,160
Did you talk to His Majesty
about your wife?

131
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,560
My wife and I met in hardship.

132
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,519
Even His Majesty praises my wife

133
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,680
as the model of contemporary women.

134
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,120
It just seems

135
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,519
that your opinion and His Majesty's
are somewhat divergent.

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,839
Who let these servants in?

137
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,319
I just listened to some slander.

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,360
Since His Majesty has his own judgment,

139
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,879
I, naturally,
will respect His Majesty's decree.

140
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,159
Ms. Gong,

141
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,679
His Majesty appreciates you
as a model for women.

142
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,039
Then I should also
appreciate you properly.

143
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,000
Ms. Gong, come and receive your reward.

144
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
Your Grace,

145
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,759
are you going to reward me or Ms. Gong?

146
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,600
Her Grace is magnanimous

147
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,960
to let you settle this matter
in the status of Ms. Gong.

148
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,279
The Rong family will
no longer pursue your fraud in marriage.

149
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
Quickly accept the reward.

150
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,120
So, in this life,

151
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,120
I can only be Gong Wan'er, can't I?

152
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,320
I can't accept the reward.

153
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,759
How dare you?

154
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,200
I have a complaint to make today.

155
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,919
This is not a court.

156
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,279
If you have grievance,
go to the government office.

157
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,759
You are in charge of the harem
in a position like an empress.

158
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
For the common people,

159
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,600
the emperor is like a father,
and the empress is like a mother.

160
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
There's nothing wrong with me
presenting my grievance

161
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,919
to Your Grace.

162
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,240
What nonsense! Shut your mouth!

163
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,759
Your Grace,
human life is of utmost importance.

164
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,240
Are you also going to turn a blind eye?

165
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,200
If this gets out,

166
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,279
I'm afraid the public will say that
you can't distinguish right from wrong,

167
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,000
and it will even make all the women
in the country disheartened.

168
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,440
Since it involves human life,

169
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
tell me,

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,480
who are you advocating for?

171
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,440
