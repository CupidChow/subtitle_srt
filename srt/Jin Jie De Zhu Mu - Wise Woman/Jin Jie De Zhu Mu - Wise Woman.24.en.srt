1
00:00:06,768 --> 00:00:11,010
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,240
Since it involves human life,

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,240
tell me,

4
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:16,519
who are you advocating for?

5
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,440
Xue Wan'er.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,800
Xue Wan'er?

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,039
Who is Xue Wan'er?

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,879
I don't know.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,839
I've never heard of her.

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,359
Who is Xue Wan'er?

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,079
Have you heard of her?

12
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:27,760
Xue Wan'er?

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,280
Wait, didn't she say
Xue Wan'er was dead?

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,240
Who killed her?

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,640
The people who killed her

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,799
are 113 in total.

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,840
Two years ago,

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,960
the Xue family killed her

19
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,280
because she fell in love
with the hunter Zhao Yan,

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,200
which disgraced the family.

21
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,719
She was beaten to death

22
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,320
on the orders
of the Xue family's head and elders.

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,679
=Episode 24=

24
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:57,439
Beat her.

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,200
Beat her.

26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,280
Beat her.

27
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,479
A year ago,

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,479
the fourth branch of the Rong family,

29
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,120
Rong Xiu and his wife, Xue Lingyi,
killed her again.

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,920
Xue Lingyi, knowing that
she was carrying Zhao Yan's child,

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,040
concealed it and deceived others.

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,480
For her own selfish interests,

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,640
Xue Lingyi allowed Rong Xiu to rape her.

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,079
Eight months later,

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Xue Lingyi falsely claimed
that the child Xue Wan'er gave birth to

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,879
was the offspring of the Rong family.

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,159
She killed Xue Wan'er to take her child

38
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,959
and drowned her in a pond.

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,239
The third time,
it was the Rong family members

40
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,640
and those spectators who killed her.

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,840
They didn't seek the truth

42
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,040
but used their words as knives.

43
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,760
These days,

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,040
the rumors on the streets
have repeatedly tortured her.

45
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,719
Then, for so-called honor

46
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,599
and reputation,

47
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,000
the Rong family covered up for Rong Xiu
without regard for the truth

48
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,840
and wanted to execute me privately.

49
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,039
I

50
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,680
am not Ms. Gong.

51
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,360
I am Xue Wan'er.

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,240
One person's words can't be trusted.

53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,080
You may step back.

54
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,759
I have a witness.

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,159
Greetings, Your Grace.

56
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,319
I am the doctor in charge
of treating the Xue family.

57
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,360
Two years ago,
on the eighth night of December,

58
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,680
I was hurriedly called
to the Xue's mansion.

59
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,120
There can be no mistake.

60
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,960
Are you sure?

61
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,280
It's just been a month,
so it's not visible yet.

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,159
This matter
must be kept absolutely secret,

63
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,520
especially from her.

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,680
On the eighth day of December,
I was still at Xue's mansion.

65
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,319
I had never been to the capital,
nor had I ever seen Rong Xiu.

66
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,879
As for this matter, many servants
in the Rong family can testify.

67
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,039
You will know that
after an investigation.

68
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,520
Your Grace,
this matter is a domestic affair.

69
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
It should be judged by the family head.

70
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,560
Xue Wan'er is talking nonsense.

71
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,639
She is causing damage
to the reputation of our family

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,000
and making the matriarch
troubled by rumors.

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,360
She is already so old. Can you bear...

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,479
Shut up.

75
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,960
I finally understand
the suffering you've endured.

76
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,479
(Royal Concubine Wu)
I will apply to His Majesty

77
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,280
to establish a mansion
for you and the general,

78
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,439
allowing you to live separately
from the Rong family.

79
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,280
This way, your family can be reunited,

80
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,639
and you will no longer be bullied.

81
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,680
I can even apply
for an imperial edict for you.

82
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,680
Your Grace,

83
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,040
I indeed wish
for a peaceful family reunion.

84
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,240
But this cannot erase the wrongs
I have suffered.

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,959
No amount of wealth and honor

86
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,199
can buy off justice and morality,

87
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,040
nor can it make me forget

88
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,079
that the Xue family and the Rong family
betrayed me,

89
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,279
wronged me, insulted me,

90
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,519
and tried to kill me three times

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
in the name of rites and norms.

92
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,800
Your Grace, please get justice for me.

93
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,079
It's a murder case
you are talking about.

94
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,720
It should be handled
by government officials.

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,240
There is nothing I can do
about this matter.

96
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,759
Let's see

97
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,920
who is willing to take this case.

98
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,959
Your Grace,

99
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,839
although my husband is not here today,

100
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,279
I am willing to convince him
to take this case.

101
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,199
I am also willing to convince my husband
to take this case.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,160
I am willing to testify. The Rong family
indeed wants to kill her.

103
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,360
I-I can also testify.

104
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,199
There are witnesses available.

105
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,199
I, Li Ang, from the Ministry of Justice,
am willing to take on this case.

106
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,600
I am also willing to handle it.

107
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,160
Me too.

108
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,839
I am willing to testify.

109
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,959
I beg for your mercy, Your Grace.

110
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,040
At your request,

111
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,040
I won't let you take my reward

112
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,680
in the name of Gong Wan'er.

113
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,800
Once the case is concluded,

114
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,959
the truth comes to light,

115
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,199
and the guilty face justice,

116
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,879
I will personally put this hairpin

117
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,199
on Xue Wan'er.

118
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:51,959
Thank you, Your Grace.

119
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,519
Matriarch!

120
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,560
(Virtuous And Genuine)

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,759
Yu is not mine.

122
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,480
Yu is not my child.

123
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:54,208
(Permanent Health and Harmony)

124
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,519
This is Rong's mansion.

125
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,920
This is

126
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,560
the mansion of a marquis.

127
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:25,560
I wish
I had never been in the Rong family.

128
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,600
I'm here to keep you company.

129
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,639
I'm here to keep you company.

130
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,399
(Rong's Mansion)
This is to rectify the name of Xue Wan'er.

131
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,679
(Inherit Great Virtues)
Rong Xiu will be struck out.

132
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,399
(Inherit Achievement)
Rong Tingyu is now under Rong Yan

133
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,240
and Xue Wan'er's names.

134
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,440
You may leave.

135
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,639
This...

136
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,879
Although I am titled

137
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,440
and have served in the Rong family
for many years,

138
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,120
exhausted and striving,

139
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,159
I

140
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,399
made wrong decisions

141
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,559
that led to

142
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,240
family disunity and estrangement.

143
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,559
I am deeply disturbed.

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,480
I hope His Majesty

145
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,000
will not implicate the Rong family

146
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,720
because of me and Rong Xiu.

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,120
I'm

148
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,960
extremely grateful.

149
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,639
Matriarch,

150
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,159
why are you...

151
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,240
You

152
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,279
are a good girl.

153
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,440
Previous happenings

154
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,919
were my own wrongdoing.

155
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I was wholeheartedly thinking
for the Rong family,

156
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,679
and it ended up hurting you instead.

157
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
If you hate me

158
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,360
or blame me,

159
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,039
I deserve it.

160
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
My sins are great.

161
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,879
I'll take the blame.

162
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,080
This is the memorial

163
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,960
I submitted earlier.

164
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,600
His Majesty has already approved it.

165
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,559
I know Yan and you

166
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,279
don't value these hypocrisies,

167
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,639
but this can be considered

168
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:58,159
the last thing

169
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,559
I did for you

170
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,000
and the Rong family.

171
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,759
Is it worth it?

172
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,480
Are all these things you've done

173
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,799
for everyone in your lifetime

174
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,039
worth it?

175
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,440
Whether it's worth it or not

176
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:41,200
can't be figured out clearly.

177
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:05,184
(Matriarch Rong kneeled for
three days and three nights)

178
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:11,072
(to redeem the sins of the Rong family
and beg for the emperor's grace.)

179
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:15,872
(She died of exhaustion.)

180
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,440
Where are you going?

181
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,240
The young master is so chubby.

182
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,279
Watch me catch you.

183
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,039
Mother, save me!

184
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,639
If it weren't for my big shoes,

185
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,159
