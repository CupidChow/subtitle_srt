1
00:00:06,404 --> 00:00:11,072
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,679
What happened to her?

3
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,839
She...

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,120
She's dead.

5
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,359
What?

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,560
It wasn't me.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,240
She cheated, so I...

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,320
It wasn't me, Matriarch.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,280
I swear.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I knew you
were a jealous woman long ago.

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,679
Because I pitied you, I indulged you.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,039
You couldn't bear a son and you stopped

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,679
=Episode 13=
Rong Xiu taking a concubine before,

14
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,079
but I said nothing about it.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,119
I just didn't expect

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,120
you to deal with the women
by Rong Xiu's side like that.

17
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,959
How vicious you are.

18
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,959
It wasn't me.

19
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,840
I swear.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,400
Matriarch.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,560
Get out.

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,640
Go wash the filth off of you.

23
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,719
If Rong Xiu is to inherit
the title in the future,

24
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,920
he'll need a wife who can uphold
the dignity of a marquise.

25
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,560
I fear Xue Lingyi

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,519
may not be up to it.

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,560
If she isn't up to it...

28
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
Matriarch,

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,799
your maiden family
was once incredibly prestigious.

30
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,560
I've heard you have a distant grandniece

31
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,480
who's still unmarried.

32
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,360
Mother.

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Mother.

34
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,919
You wanted to see me?

35
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,080
Xiu,

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,599
this is Wu Yueyun,
the matriarch's grandniece.

37
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:24,388
(Wu Yueyun)

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,599
Cousin.

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,319
Xiu,

40
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,240
can you accompany Yueyun
for a walk around?

41
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,759
Okay.

42
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,639
Yueyun, please.

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,319
This way.

44
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,520
Lingyi, stay

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,840
and help me with the accounts.

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,159
Cousin, why are you sighing?

47
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,639
I've spent much time in the palace.

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,759
These mundane things and sights

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,360
are rather dull.

50
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,120
You often go to the palace?

51
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,199
The Royal Concubine is from our family.

52
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,199
I often go to the palace
to pay her respect.

53
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,560
She told me

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,479
she'd give me the mansion
of the former Duke of Xiangguo

55
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,039
as a dowry.

56
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,360
The flower complements
your beauty perfectly.

57
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,919
Cousin, how about I put it on for you?

58
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,199
What? Does it not suit me?

59
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,280
It does.

60
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,599
Yueyun,

61
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,439
how would a man like my husband

62
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,360
know how to put a flower
in a young lady's hair?

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,800
Mrs. Rong.

64
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,160
Let me do it for you.

65
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,079
Even if you don't like it,

66
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,399
you don't have to prick me
with the thorn.

67
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,639
This...

68
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,879
It seems that you don't know me well.

69
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,319
If I wanted to harm someone,

70
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,519
I would never use a flower
to prick your hand.

71
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,000
I would push you into that flower bush

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,120
and let the thorns scratch your face.

73
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,720
Isn't that more effective?

74
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,160
But

75
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,680
why would I do that?

76
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,959
Cousin,

77
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,959
I really don't understand

78
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,639
why she would think

79
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,399
that I wanted to harm her.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,199
What are you doing here?

81
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,000
Didn't Mother ask you
to handle the accounts?

82
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,199
Hurry back

83
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,319
to do your work.

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,079
Yueyun,

85
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,959
the front yard

86
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,759
is filled with treasures bestowed
by the Emperor.

87
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,040
Why don't we go and have a look?

88
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,639
It really pricked you.

89
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,600
Let me take a look.

90
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,399
We are a couple.

91
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,839
Why do you have to be angry with others?

92
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,879
Good.

93
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,279
Be obedient.

94
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,360
(How come these two are here together?)

95
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,720
(Who are they paying respects to?)

96
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,920
Wan'er,

97
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,040
rest in peace.

98
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,399
Yueyun,

99
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
it must be hard for you

100
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,480
to play nice with Rong Xiu.

101
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,839
Wan'er was my best friend,

102
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,680
so I must do something for her

103
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,920
to alleviate the hatred in my heart.

104
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,759
The Rong family killed her.

105
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,680
I won't let them get away with it.

106
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,839
Who's it?

107
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,920
Are you really telling the truth?

108
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,920
You're really bewitched.

109
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,959
Do you really think such a noble lady

110
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,399
will fall for you?

111
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,639
Why wouldn't she?

112
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,560
If she truly admires me,

113
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,680
how could she care about
my family status?

114
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,279
It's been only half a day.

115
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,360
How could she truly
fall in love with you?

116
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:39,000
What about you?
Do you have feelings for her too?

117
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,079
My lady.

118
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,160
What about me?

119
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,439
Fine. Since you don't believe it,

120
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,360
