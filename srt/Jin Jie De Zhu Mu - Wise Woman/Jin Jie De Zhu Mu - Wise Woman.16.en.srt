=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,240
Wan'er,

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,439
you mentioned feeling
unwell during dinner.

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,280
Let me have a look at you.

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:18,600
I...

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,719
I'm much better.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,839
My lady, please open the door.

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,480
I have already gone to bed

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:25,839
with a disheveled appearance.

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,559
Please go back, Matriarch.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,479
There's someone in the room.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,119
I had a feeling something was off
about the marquise earlier.

13
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,640
It seems I was right.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,759
Should we force our way in?

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:38,840
No, we must not.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,200
If the gossip gets out
from some loose-lipped servant,

17
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,079
it will be our family's end.

18
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,920
I won't enter.

19
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,679
Please take care.

20
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,200
=Episode 16=
Remember you are the marquise.

21
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,600
Yes.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Leave now.

23
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,560
It is dangerous to stay here.

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,280
Don't worry about me.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,000
I can come

26
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,519
and leave here

27
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,560
as I please.

28
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,519
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,840
This is the Marquis's residence.

30
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,959
You're just a commoner.

31
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,040
If they see you, you're dead for sure.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,799
Okay.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,599
I will be waiting for you at home.

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Go.

35
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:45,856
(Rong's Mansion)

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,319
My lady,

37
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,560
all packed.

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,519
Let's go back to Gong's mansion
to pick up your son.

39
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,480
Your family will be reunited.

40
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,000
But

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,079
what about the Gong family?

42
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,519
What about you?

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,959
But that is your husband.

44
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,280
You've been apart for so long.

45
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,760
You don't need to sacrifice yourself
for the Gong family anymore.

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,639
Don't you miss him night after night?

47
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,159
You always call his name in your dreams.

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,639
My lady,

49
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,000
you don't have to suffer anymore.

50
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,280
You should start living for yourself.

I need to stay in Rong's mansion

to be the marquise.

81
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,439
What?

82
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,279
It's the general.

You're the general?

(Ancestors' memorial tablets)
Mother, I'm here to see you.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,560
This is my wife.

00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,480
I brought her to pay our respects.

91
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,040
Matriarch,

92
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,439
why does the general and the lady seem
to have known each other for so long?

93
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:18,199
The general is the guarantee
of our family's prosperity.

94
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,759
The rest doesn't matter.

95
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,720
The general is back.

96
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,720
It is the general.

97
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,120
The general is back.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,199
H-He is really back?

99
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,240
The general really came back.

100

Since you are safe and sound,

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,279
then the news
about the general's death back then...

108
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,759
It was false news

come straight back here?

to take me with you?
