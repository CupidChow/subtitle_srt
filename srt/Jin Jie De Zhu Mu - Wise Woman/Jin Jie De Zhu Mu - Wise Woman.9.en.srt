1
00:00:06,404 --> 00:00:11,275
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,440
Ghosts!

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,719
Young master,

4
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:28,120
by the marquise's order,

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,120
you should go
to Matriarch Rong's room now

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,800
to kneel down and beg for mercy.

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,280
Matriarch, please forgive my mother.

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,759
What are you doing?

9
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,280
Did you forget?

10
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,799
=Episode 9=
I'll be Xue Wan'er's son for three years.

11
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,320
Now that my mother is locked up,

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,159
isn't it time for me,

13
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,039
the filial son, to plead for her?

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,679
Are you stupid?

15
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,759
Then how long are you going to kneel?

16
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,920
Wait until the matriarch forgives her.

17
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,079
Or until the madam of the eldest branch
wakes up.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,159
Do you think

19
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,159
Xue Wan'er is really that bad

20
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,640
to poison
the madam of the eldest branch?

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,519
Well...

22
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,599
How would I know?

23
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,439
Something is strange about this.

24
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:26,880
(Virtuous)

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,480
I can't take it anymore.

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,319
I've been kneeling for a day.

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,640
This plaster gives
a cool, numb feeling when applied.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,480
You will not feel the pain.

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,519
And you can then kneel
for a few more days.

30
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,480
This is outrageous.

31
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,439
Take it easy.

32
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,680
For the title,

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,079
I have to keep playing

34
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,359
this show.

35
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,280
Playing well means
being one with the marquise

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,760
and sharing the same heart with her.

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,120
Then,

38
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,280
nobody will stop me
from inheriting the title.

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,719
But...

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,159
Young master,

41
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,719
it's time to get up.

42
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,919
Not again.

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,240
Grandma! Grandma!

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,159
Grandma,

45
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,120
I beg you. Please forgive my mother.

46
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,599
Why are you doing this?

47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,919
She made such a mistake.

48
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,919
No matter how long you kneel,
it won't help.

49
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,080
Mother.

50
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,240
Mother,

51
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,400
I sincerely pleaded with the matriarch.

52
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,680
Your servants can testify.

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,439
But she remains as hard as a rock.

54
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,960
She refuses to forgive you.

55
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,199
So you're just going to
leave me to my fate?

56
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,520
Mother, you must tell me.

57
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
Did you poison
the madam of the eldest branch or not?

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,759
If you were falsely accused,

59
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,039
wouldn't it be better for me
to clear your name?

60
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,159
What...

61
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,479
What are you laughing at?

62
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,800
As for the medicine,

63
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,599
isn't your brilliant wife supposed

64
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,400
to know it all too well?

65
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,919
Why are you still asking me
in such a pretentious manner?

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,360
What

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,960
do you mean?

68
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
What?

69
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,879
Watching you suffer day by day,

70
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,039
didn't your wife tell you anything?

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,159
It seems that she only
cares for her own safety

72
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,240
and doesn't care about your life at all.

73
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,159
Why are you acting so panicky?

74
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,560
What's wrong with you?

75
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
Tell me the truth.

76
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,759
Was the poisoning of the madam

77
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,839
and Xue Wan'er's confinement
all your doing?

78
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,519
Why do you think that all of a sudden?

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,000
Did Xue Wan'er tell you something?

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,879
I knew it.

81
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,399
Xue Wan'er
couldn't possibly be so stupid.

82
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:31,879
You...

83
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,600
You're

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,199
the only one behind this.

85
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,879
Well done, Xue Lingyi.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,199
I've knelt in front of
the matriarch's door for so long

87
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,399
that my knees are all worn out

88
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,199
because of your treachery.

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,920
Why would you plead for Xue Wan'er
based on her words?

90
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,839
Do you really think if you saved her,

91
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,319
she would kindly let you
inherit the title?

92
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,680
So you just decided to have her killed?

93
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,040
If she dies, my hope
of inheriting the title will be dashed.

94
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,399
Don't you understand it yet?

95
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,480
She wants to seek revenge on us.

96
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,519
She hates us so much.

97
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,560
How could she let someone
as incompetent as you inherit the title?

98
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,480
Even if I'm being delusional,
I still have to try.

99
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,959
I warn you.

100
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,720
Stop messing around behind my back.

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,360
Find a solution
to the poison issue immediately

102
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,839
and save Xue Wan'er.

103
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Or else,

104
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,399
even if I have to betray you,

105
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,360
I will protect Xue Wan'er.

106
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,040
We are a couple.

107
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,079
Without wealth and honor,

108
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,839
will you still be my wife?

109
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,040
Get out of my sight.

110
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,040
I feel like I've been locked up
for so long.

111
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,160
Looking at the plants in this garden,

112
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,519
everything seems so vibrant.

113
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,920
The matter has been cleared up.

114
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,079
The madam of the eldest branch
drank a tonic first

115
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,399
and then drank a laxative soup.

116
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,040
The combination of the two decoctions
caused toxicity.

117
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,879
However, after recuperation,

118
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:58,879
she is almost recovered.

119
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,279
Is this what Xue Lingyi said
to the matriarch?

120
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,600
I'm tired.

121
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,360
Let's rest over there.

122
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,240
I really don't understand

123
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,439
why my sister wanted to hurt me.

124
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,199
She...

125
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,519
She was just confused at the moment.

126
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,800
She is not confused at all.

127
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,480
It's you who are confused.

128
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,000
She definitely told you

129
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,759
that I did not sincerely help you
gain the title,

130
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,360
and that's why she wanted to hurt me,

131
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,959
didn't she?

132
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,720
She lied to you.

133
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,079
As long as you seize the title,

134
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,079
then in the future,

135
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,959
it will belong to our child, Yu.

136
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,839
Why wouldn't I support you
with all my strength?

137
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,079
But what was Xue Lingyi planning?

138
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,079
S-She knew you would help me.

139
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,279
But she thought you would do that
without regard for her life,

140
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,399
and you might even take revenge on her.

141
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,600
So that's why she took action.

142
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,199
Once she makes a move,

143
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,800
she will not stop.

144
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,920
Don't worry. As long as I am here,

145
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,639
I will never let her hurt you.
