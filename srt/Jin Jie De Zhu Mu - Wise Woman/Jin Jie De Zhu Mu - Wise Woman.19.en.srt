1
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:11,134
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,280
Who on earth are we going to see
in such a desolate place?

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,800
When we arrive, you'll know.

4
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,200
You're here to see me.

5
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,600
Aren't you sick?

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,079
Are you concerned about me?

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,439
Utterly boring.

8
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,840
So you really loathe to see me.

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,479
Rong Yan, I'm supposed to be your wife.

10
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,840
=Episode 19=

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,679
We...

12
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,039
Wan'er, it's a misunderstanding.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,840
You're...

14
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,519
She is the concubine
I've selected for the general.

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,239
What do you think, Matriarch?

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,200
It's good that you know your place.

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,319
It's a great thing to expand our family.

18
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,040
I will definitely agree.

19
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,599
That's good. Let me prepare.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,400
I'll pick an auspicious day
for her to enter the mansion.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,519
I didn't agree.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,760
In my life, I only have one wife,
who is Gong Wan'er.

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,239
I would never consider marrying others.

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,439
Are you really sure, General?

25
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,000
What if...

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,319
I won the battle

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,319
and thus gained His Majesty's favor.

28
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,519
I'm sure I can protect the one

29
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,760
who I want to protect

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,359
regardless of her mistakes.

31
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,680
What is there to be afraid of?

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,239
You're really good to your wife.

33
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,920
Right.

34
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,400
You have a good father.

35
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,200
He selected such a good husband
for his daughter.

36
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,240
All the parents in the world

37
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,840
would exhaust all means

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,039
to satisfy their daughter's wishes

39
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,599
about marriage.

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,879
I think my father would do the same.

41
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,360
He will do it wholeheartedly

42
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,840
for his own biological daughter.

43
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,199
You.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,199
My daughter.

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,199
My daughter.

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,319
My daughter.

47
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:29,759
Daughter.

48
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,840
My daughter.

49
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:33,039
There she goes again.

50
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,280
My daughter.

51
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,280
So you are really here.

52
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,039
It's all because of you,
with deceitful intentions.

53
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,919
Why did you harm my daughter?

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,319
Wan'er,

55
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,319
are you alright?

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Mother,

57
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm fine.

58
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,240
Mother...

59
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,319
What's wrong with you?

60
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,039
How did your parents teach you?

61
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,240
Be kind to others.

62
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,719
Don't harm others for your own benefit.

63
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,919
If you are still obstinate,

64
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,520
how heartbroken your parents would be.

65
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,439
Let me teach you a lesson for them.

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,719
Stop it!

67
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,080
Stop.

68
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,639
Do you know your mistake?

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,759
I know.

70
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,159
Let's go to my mansion,

71
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,479
and see what Master will do to you.

72
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,599
Be gentle. Ouch.

73
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,240
Go.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,479
That woman

75
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,120
bears some resemblance to Madam Gong.

76
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,479
Our family is a whole,

77
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,960
and honor and shame

78
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,919
are all shared together.

79
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,879
As long as you don't harm
our family's interests,

80
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,280
I won't delve

81
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
into some things.

82
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,319
Good girl.

83
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
The dignity of General and you

84
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,919
represents that of the family.

85
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,639
Do you understand?

86
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,599
I understand.

87
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,199
(Madam Gong.)

88
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,959
(No, thank you, Mother.)

89
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,959
(Rong's Mansion)
Look, they've returned the child.

90
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,000
The matter is over.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,199
It's over now?

92
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,800
Yes.

93
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,959
The makeup on the clothes
was from Gong Wan'er.

94
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,879
I was afraid
that she would run out of the city

95
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,199
and make a scene,

96
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,680
so I took people to check on her.

97
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
What I said

98
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,360
is all true.

99
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,600
I knew you wouldn't have the guts.

100
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,000
I've told you everything.

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,839
Then you...

102
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,240
Alright.

103
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,000
It's okay if you don't want

104
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,160
to tell me.

105
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,360
In any case,

106
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,160
no matter what,

107
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,800
I will always support you.

108
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,040
No.

109
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,439
I've already decided.

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,079
I want to tell you everything.

111
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:30,752
(Rong's Mansion)

112
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:32,736
(Ancestral Merits and Virtues)

113
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,160
I want to kill him too.

114
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,879
I think about killing him day and night,

115
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,240
but what about the child?

116
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,079
Words can be terrifying.

117
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,079
We can ignore them,

118
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,600
but what about our child?

119
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,399
Both of us grew up in such a mansion.

120
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,680
The mockery

121
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,279
and the rumors

122
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,319
cut our hearts
like a knife again and again.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,199
If we take Yu back to us

124
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,120
without finding

125
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,199
evidence or witnesses

126
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,240
and setting the record straight first,

127
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,759
the knife pointed at the child

128
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,879
will be thousands of times sharper
than that pointed at us.

129
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,560
Do you want to see him endure that?

130
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Promise me.

131
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,680
I've already sent someone
to find the witness.

132
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,000
After we find the evidence,

133
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,560
let them be subject to justice.

134
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,759
Alright?

135
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,839
Alright.

136
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,839
I promise.

137
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,720
Xiu.

138
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,040
Uncle and Aunt.

139
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,879
Uncle, what are you doing?

140
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,399
How does my sword

141
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,680
look to you?

142
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,040
Your sword

143
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,639
is surely unparalleled.

144
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,680
Really? This sword
has seen too much blood,

145
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,120
and killed too many people.

146
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,920
I guess it won't sever a person's neck

147
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,360
with one stroke easily as before.

148
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,480
Uncle, please don't scare me.

149
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,240
The men of this generation
from Rong Family

150
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,480
are far inferior to those
of previous generations.

151
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
Why did he suddenly do that to me?

152
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,159
