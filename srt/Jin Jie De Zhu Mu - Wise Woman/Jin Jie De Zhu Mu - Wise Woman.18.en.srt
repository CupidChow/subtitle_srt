00:00:06,468 --> 00:00:11,250
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,400
My lady, the general has returned.

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,400
The general didn't come home last night.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,839
Please don't say anything
that will make him misunderstand again.

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,320
He and I went through
so much trouble to reunite.

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,760
Why can't we be honest with each other?

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
My lady.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,480
I can see the general deeply loves you.

9
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,280
Even without evidence,

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,799
he would still believe you.

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,359
Look at you all.
Just after a few days without practice,

12
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,719
you've become so sloppy.

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,520
General, don't take your anger out on...

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,399
My lady.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,719
I didn't know you are in the room.

16
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,439
Let's eat.

17
00:00:55,697 --> 00:01:00,536
=Episode 18=

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,959
These...

19
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,120
These are the dishes
you taught me to make.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,359
Try it to see
if it still tastes the same.

21
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,280
Alright.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,079
There's something

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,359
I want to talk to you about.

24
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,719
Okay, go ahead.

25
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,040
General.

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,560
My lord,

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,319
where did you stay last night?

28
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,719
Last night...

29
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,799
I stayed in the military camp.
What's the matter?

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
It's nothing.

31
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,760
Let's eat.

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,439
Didn't you just say
you had something to tell me?

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,599
It's nothing.

34
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,400
General, marquise,

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,439
I'm here to ask to see you.

36
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:22,840
Come in.

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,479
General,

38
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,240
could I possibly speak
with marquise alone?

39
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,080
What?

40
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,039
Can't I know

41
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,479
what you're going to talk about?

42
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,639
Xiu, you can just tell...

43
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,439
It seems like it's urgent.

44
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll be right back.

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,159
Wait.

46
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,199
What's so urgent

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
that you don't even
have time to eat with me?

48
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,039
Xiu, you go out first.
I'll be right there.

49
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,800
Yes.

50
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,800
You eat first.

51
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,599
I will be right back.

52
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,280
So,

53
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,599
you still don't want to tell me?

54
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,199
What about you?

55
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,000
Isn't there anything

56
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,879
that you don't want me to ask?

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,080
I…

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,199
You eat first.

59
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,120
I...

60
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,919
I will be back soon.

61
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,400
Where did you take the child?

62
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,240
He's my child.

63
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,560
How can you not let me see him?

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,719
What do you mean?

65
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,560
Why did you say that?

66
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,840
Isn't my child at Gong's mansion?

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,560
He...

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,080
He wasn't taken by you?

69
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,919
But I just went to Gong's mansion,

70
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,439
and Master Gong
just gave me a pellet drum.

71
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,400
And he told me the child
was not at the mansion anymore.

72
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,639
What?

73
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:22,000
(Gong's Mansion)

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,560
Are you saying Gong Wan'er didn't die?

75
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,199
Our couple only has one daughter.

76
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,720
She's been pampered since childhood,

77
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,439
which has made her
spoiled and thoughtless.

78
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,360
Unexpectedly,

79
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,839
she faked her death
to avoid the marriage

80
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,920
and even managed
to deceive me and her mother,

81
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,600
which caused you
to replace her in the marriage.

82
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,639
But now...

83
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,040
But now, my daughter has survived.

84
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,079
She has met the general.

85
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,759
She hopes to marry into the Rong Family.

86
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,720
What?

87
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,079
After all...

88
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,639
After all, the bride

89
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,839
should have been her.

90
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,279
What do you mean

91
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,480
by that?

92
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,600
You're occupying everything
that my daughter should have.

93
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,759
She even lost her identity.

94
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,480
How pitiful she is.

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,839
She's pitiful.

96
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,279
But what about me?

97
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,920
Was I willing
to take everything from her?

98
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,480
Am I living a life of luxury?

99
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,519
In Rong Family...

100
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,000
You are the high-status marquise.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,800
What else do you want?

102
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,519
Think about it.

103
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,240
Think about your background.

104
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,639
Master Gong,

105
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,240
I still remember the time

106
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,639
when you saved me.

107
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,480
Madam Gong treated me
as her own daughter.

108
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,319
My parents passed away early.

109
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,800
I've never experienced the family love.

110
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,879
I am grateful to you,

111
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,360
thinking to myself

112
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,439
I'd be your filial daughter
in place of your lost one.

113
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,720
I was too presumptuous.

114
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,879
Since you remember we saved you,

115
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,240
you should return the favor.

116
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,839
We are not heartless.

117
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
As long as you agree

118
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,319
to let my daughter marry
into the Rong Family.

119
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
My daughter

120
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,040
still concerns about you.

121
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,600
Even if you make her a concubine,

122
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,199
she will also bear it.

123
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,160
She will also accept it.

124
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,839
What's more, because she returned,

125
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,360
your mother's condition has improved.
Can you stand seeing her...

126
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,480
But I

127
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,240
refuse.

128
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,720
Then,

129
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,920
I can only make you experience

130
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,480
the pain of parting with your son.

131
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,000
The day my daughter marries
into the Rong Family

132
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,079
is when you reunite with your child.

133
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,079
Miss Gong.

134
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,600
Are you okay?

135
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,480
I've had this illness
since I was little.

136
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,399
I want to see the general.

137
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,920
I have something to say to him.

138
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,800
Okay. I'll tell him immediately.

139
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,920
