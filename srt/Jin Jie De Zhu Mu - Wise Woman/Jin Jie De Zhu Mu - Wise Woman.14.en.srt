1
00:00:06,468 --> 00:00:11,168
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,120
Madam.

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,600
Is this for Miss Wu?

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,239
Yes.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,960
Chun Yu, come and check this wine.

6
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,159
This wine is really good.

7
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:51,679
(Xue Wan'er,
as long as you warn Wu Yueyun,)

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,200
(Rong Xiu will know
you two are deceiving him.)

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,679
Cousin,

10
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:59,159
=Episode 14=
how have you been here these days?

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,960
Quite good. Thank you, cousin.

12
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,200
Miss Wu,

13
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,040
if Rong Xiu doesn't treat you well,

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,599
you must tell me.

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,439
I will definitely stand up for you.

16
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,640
Thank you, Aunt.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
Let me

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
propose a toast to Mother,

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,599
my lady and my cousin.

20
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,519
May our family be harmonious
and may things prosper in the future.

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,159
Yueyun, why aren't you drinking?

22
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,359
Does the wine not suit your taste?

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,319
I

24
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,239
cannot handle my alcohol.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,079
In that case...

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,799
I can't handle alcohol.

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,439
But since

28
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,760
it's your toast,

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,560
so I won't refuse.

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,120
Xiu,

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,719
since your cousin drank it,

32
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,879
shouldn't you drink one too?

33
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,680
Come on.

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,039
Let me fill it up for you.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,280
Thank you, Mother.

36
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,319
Cousin, here's to you.

37
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,120
Why isn't the ginseng soup ready yet?

38
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,400
Lingyi, go to the kitchen
and hurry them along.

39
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,039
Chun Yu.

40
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,479
Lingyi,

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,479
the ginseng is very expensive.

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,960
The matriarch gave it
to Yueyun to nourish her health.

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
You should personally go check it.

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,199
Yes.

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,759
Eat.

46
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,680
Eat.

47
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,960
I have finished eating.

48
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,840
Take your time.

49
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,800
Du Juan, go get the matriarch.

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,400
Yes.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,080
Hold on.

52
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,840
Have the doctor wait secretly as well.

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,439
Yes.

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:17,840
Cousin.

55
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,520
Cousin,

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,879
don't do this.

57
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,560
You are so pretty.

58
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,240
What are you wearing inside?

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,520
Let me have a look.

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,639
(No, if I break in,)

61
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,879
(then it'll be done)

62
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,319
(and be irreversible.)

63
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,960
Let me go!

64
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,280
What are you doing here?

65
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,840
Why didn't you go in?

66
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,039
I...

67
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,120
Matriarch Rong heard
Xiu and Yueyun get along well,

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,560
and she is very happy
to have a meal with them together.

69
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
Lingyi, go open the door.

70
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,080
There's nobody inside.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
My husband and Yueyun
went for a walk in the garden.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,719
Matriarch, let's find them together.

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,919
Yueyun.

74
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:10,199
Let's keep drinking, Yueyun.

75
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,719
Cousin, don't leave. Stay here with me.

76
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,160
Cousin, you smell so good.

77
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,000
Good cousin, let me hold you.

78
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,519
You two

79
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,279
are really vicious.

80
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,480
How could you drug her?

81
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,079
How can we

82
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,000
have fools like you in our family?

83
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,800
If we miss this opportunity,

84
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,199
it's hard to say when we will have

85
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,319
another chance to bring down Xue Lingyi.

86
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,959
Wan'er,

87
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,920
if you trust me,

88
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,120
just do it.

89
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,360
Don't worry.

90
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,040
I know what to do.

91
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,560
You two

92
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,199
now come to ask for her forgiveness.

93
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Yueyun,

94
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,040
you must be scared.

95
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,879
You lowly woman.

96
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,920
It's all my fault
for indulging you too much

97
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,839
which allowed you
to make such a big mistake.

98
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,560
You really have the audacity.

99
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,360
Jealousy is another thing,

100
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,680
but you are still like that
after my cousin's visit.

101
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,720
We two are mutually in love.

102
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,079
You are afraid that your status

103
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,560
will be affected after she marries me,

104
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,120
so you oppose her in every way.

105
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,360
You even resorted to despicable tactics.

106
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
You are truly a venomous woman.

107
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,639
You!

108
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,800
How can you pin all this

109
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,680
on me?

110
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,600
I did all of this for you.

111
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,639
Open your eyes wide and see clearly.

112
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,720
It's the two of them
who are conspiring to deceive you.

113
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,879
Ever since I married you,

114
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,959
every single thing I've done
and every plot I've hatched

115
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,279
has been for your benefit.

116
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,639
Without me,

117
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,920
how could you get a son?

118
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,000
And how could you inherit the title?

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,279
Now, you've climbed the ladder,

120
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,160
and you want
to trample me under your feet.

121
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,639
Let me tell you.

122
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,000
Without me,

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,319
you are nothing.

124
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,399
Shut up.

125
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,720
Matriarch, she's raving.

126
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,079
Don't listen to her nonsense.

127
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,040
Yueyun, how do you think

128
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,000
she should be dealt with?

129
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,160
Great-aunt,

130
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,000
I

131
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,879
just want to go home.

132
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,079
Cousin,

133
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,560
didn't we agree?

134
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,079
I will protect you and take care of you,

135
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,040
and you will serve me and help me.

136
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,680
Don't let this vile woman
sow discord between us.

137
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,040
Cousin.

138
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,839
Cousin.

139
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,240
Go away.

140
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,079
Great-aunt, I just want to go home

141
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,879
right now.

142
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,920
Alright,

143
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,120
go home now.

144
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,480
Don't you understand now?

145
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,319
All of this

146
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,800
is Xue Wan'er's plot.

147
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,680
You tell me.

148
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,079
How should we deal with her?

149
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,279
We must

150
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,839
punish her severely.

151
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,759
Punishment?

152
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,920
Can such a vicious woman

153
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,600
still be allowed
to stay in this mansion?

154
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,839
In my opinion, she should be divorced.

155
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,240
Matriarch,

156
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,920
we're a noble family.

157
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,399
We can't divorce a wife for no reason.

158
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,279
And if outsiders ask about it,

159
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,439
are we going to tell them

160
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,600
about the truth?

161
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,600
Yes.

162
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,360
Given my cousin's reputation,
we shouldn't do this.

163
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,560
What do you mean?

164
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,639
Matriarch, for the family's reputation,

165
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,959
Lingyi must not be divorced.

166
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,279
This matter needs to be handled quietly.

167
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,200
Matriarch,

168
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,080
but Yueyun can't suffer unfairly.

169
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,320
Xiu is right.

170
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,039
Divorcing her

171
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,480
will only spread the scandal
and disgrace our family.

172
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,159
Matriarch.

173
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:51,759
Enough.

174
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,039
I call the shots here.

175
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,120
Someone.

176
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,759
Take Xue Lingyi to be detained
in the manor in Song County.

177
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,600
No one is to release her
without my order.

178
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,759
Matriarch,

179
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,840
Matriarch, the manor in Song County

180
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,519
isn't a place for people to live.

181
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,960
Many people have died there.

182
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,720
I don't want to go there.

183
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,879
I don't want to.

184
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,720
I don't want to.

185
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,120
Save me, Xiu.

186
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,159
Help me.

187
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,759
Help me, Xiu.
