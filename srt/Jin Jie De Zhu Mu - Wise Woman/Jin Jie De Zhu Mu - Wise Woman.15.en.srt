00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,439
Someone!

3
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,560
Someone!

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,800
Someone!

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,920
What are you shouting about?

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,960
Go fetch the matriarch!

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,519
I have something important
to say to her!

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,600
Something important?

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,960
What is it?

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,440
It's our family's secret. How can it
be shared with a lowly servant like you?

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,640
Who do you think you are?

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,039
Take a good look around here.

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,320
Look at you.
You're nothing but a prisoner!

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,119
Bah!

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,799
You lowly servant!
You're despicable maid.

16
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,799
How dare you hit me!

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,399
You want to fight back?

18
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,719
You want to hit me back?

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,079
Despicable!

20
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,520
Stop!

21
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,119
My lady,

22
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,719
I was disciplining her for you.

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,280
=Episode 15=
Disciplining her?

24
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:52,960
Yes.

25
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,960
What gives you the right to do it?

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:56,880
Get out!

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes.

28
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,679
I don't need you here acting kind.

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,439
She has no right to hit you,

30
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,599
but I do.

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,079
You!

32
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,280
Xue Wan'er,

33
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,680
do you think you've won?

34
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,719
Your son

35
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,719
calls Rong Xiu "Father".

36
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:29,159
You are the grandmother
of your biological son.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,840
You've got the upper hand,

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,840
but you won't speak out the truth.

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,879
Because you know

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,319
such truth

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,159
would make you and your son

42
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,319
despised by everyone.

43
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,640
Kill me!

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,719
Kill me!

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,760
Now

46
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,599
I can easily kill you.

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,159
But that's because you're down and out

48
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,560
and you've lost your power.

49
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,519
You used to be valued

50
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,800
by everyone at Xue's mansion,

51
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,919
while I was blamed,
beaten and neglected.

52
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,400
I hated it

53
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,240
because I didn't think
I did anything wrong.

54
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,520
But now I understand

55
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,280
that the Xue family

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,400
and the Rong family

57
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,719
don't care about

58
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,520
what is right or wrong.

59
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,199
I detest them,

60
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,240
but I will never be them.

61
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,159
What I seek

62
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,039
is justice and principle.

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
I want the truth
to be revealed to the public.

64
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,280
So

65
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,639
before that,

66
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,120
I won't let you die that easily.

67
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,280
Lingyi,

68
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,719
I trusted you in the past

69
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,199
not because you acted the part,

70
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,800
but because in my memory,

71
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,280
you were kind

72
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,560
as a girl.

73
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,080
Why did you become like this

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,159
after marrying into the Rong family?

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,479
(Lingyi, I should hate you.)

76
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,840
(But why does it hurt
so much to see you like this?)

77
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:11,145
(Rong's Mansion)

78
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,120
My lady, have some food.

79
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,879
This is newly smoked game.

80
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,879
You may have some appetite.

81
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,639
Wan'er, try it now.

82
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,079
This is a special dish I made for you.

83
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,800
Can this charred food edible?

84
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,079
This shredded eel in sizzling oil
is especially made for you.

85
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:36,639
Try it.

86
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,120
It's not made by the cook in this house.

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,959
It's not.

88
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,040
Go get the kitchen staff.

89
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,959
My lady,

90
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,720
these are new dishes I've learned.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,040
Liar.

92
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,519
I'll talk.

93
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,759
A strange hunter

94
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,199
gave me some money

95
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,279
to let me use his ingredients.

96
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,360
He told me he wanted
to earn your recognition.

97
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,000
My lady, I was wrong.

98
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,120
Do you know where he is?

99
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,720
Yes.

100
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,920
My lady,

101
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,879
that's his shop.

102
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,360
Have a look.

103
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,639
There are so many.

104
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,399
It's him. It must be him.

105
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,759
He's still alive.

106
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,879
He knows I'm at Rong's Mansion.

107
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,759
He won't blame me, will he?

108
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,000
No, he won't blame you.

109
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,040
He's alive and back.

110
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,399
But...

111
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,560
But I still can't reunite with him.

112
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,519
He's right in front of me,

113
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,079
but I can't go to him.

114
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,240
I'm now Marquise Rong.

115
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,759
Why?

116
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,680
Why am I Marquise Rong?

117
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,279
My lady, what are you doing here?

118
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,279
My lady.

119
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,959
I...

120
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,720
My lady heard yesterday
the game from this shop was very fresh,

121
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,199
so she came to buy some

122
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,399
for Master Gong and Madam Gong.

123
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,600
Right.

124
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,319
The game seller is right over there.

125
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,399
Forget it.

126
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,319
Matriarch doesn't like game.

127
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,839
Watch your step, please.

128
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,639
My lady, your room is this way.

129
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,360
It's you.

130
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,759
It is really you.

131
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
It is really you.

132
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,160
It's me.

133
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,519
It's me.

134
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,000
I...

135
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
I thought

136
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,879
you were dead.

137
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,240
I didn't remarry.

138
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,360
That general...

139
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,639
He's already deceased.

140
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,720
I know. I know everything.

141
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,439
As soon as I enlisted,

142
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,199
I got transferred.

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,879
Then, I encountered a big ambush
that wiped out our entire army.

144
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,319
I didn't expect to escape by a fluke.

145
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,480
It made you mistakenly
believe I was dead.

146
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,759
I should have told you earlier.

147
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,000
I should have come back sooner.

148
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,360
You've suffered

149
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,399
so much for me.

150
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,600
Later on,

151
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,600
I accidentally saw your picture.

152
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,720
Someone told me

153
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,440
you are the marquise.

154
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
So,

155
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,039
I wanted to come back and see you.

156
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,720
As long as you're back.

157
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,039
It's good that you're back.

158
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,720
Wan'er,

159
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,759
leave with me.

160
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,080
I...

161
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,240
I...

162
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,279
What's wrong?

163
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,879
I still have got other things

164
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,960
to do.

165
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,120
