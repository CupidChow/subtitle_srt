1
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:11,182
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,759
How's your face?

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:13,320
Does it hurt?

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,160
Is madam of the eldest branch
still in the courtyard?

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,800
She only kneeled for two hours.

6
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,679
I've already let her go.

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,640
My lady, why did you do it for me?

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,719
Don't say such things anymore.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,920
When I was little,
I could never understand

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,239
why in the large manor,

11
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,519
everyone was trampling
over the lower ranks

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,079
and flattering the upper class.

13
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,759
They often act self-righteously.

14
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,600
But what they do is against justice.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,679
If we back down this time,

16
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,399
we'll find ourselves keeping
taking steps back in the future.

17
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,240
It will embolden the evildoers

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,560
and make injustices
more and more severe.

19
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,399
So

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,640
we can't retreat one step.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,280
Don't burn yourself.

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,799
Lady!

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,520
That was made for you.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,280
=Episode 8=
Lady,

25
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,200
she's not a maid of ours.

26
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,920
She works for the eldest branch.

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,840
(Wu, I didn't want to be your enemy.)

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,799
(Why must you do this?)

29
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:16,799
Be gentle.

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,439
Stupid thing.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,959
What are you here for?

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,359
You're pampered.

33
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,120
You must be tired

34
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,879
after kneeling for two hours,

35
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,280
so I came to bring you a tonic.

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,879
I don't have an appetite.

37
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,760
Take it back.

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,719
The matriarch isn't here.

39
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,280
We don't need to put on a show.

40
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,239
This bowl of soup
was served by your servant.

41
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,359
But I didn't eat it.

42
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,040
Guess

43
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,640
what the reason is.

44
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,560
How do I know?

45
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,280
Because I'm afraid.

46
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,400
I just punished you

47
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,280
during the day.

48
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,520
At night, your maid

49
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,639
pretended to be mine

50
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,000
and brought me a bowl of soup.

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,039
I was afraid to eat it

52
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,879
and afraid not to.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,120
I had to come personally

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,599
to ask you

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,680
what is

56
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,039
in this soup.

57
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,680
It's just an ordinary bowl
of medicinal soup.

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,599
If it's just soup,

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,400
how about you eat it?

60
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,039
You were just punished,
so I give you a chance.

61
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,319
If you don't tell the truth,

62
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,960
I have ways

63
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,680
of finding out

64
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,280
what exactly you did.

65
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,840
Go investigate it.

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,439
Gong Wan'er, you want
to make a big fuss about this again.

67
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,560
Listen.

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,840
Don't push me too far.

69
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,919
Since you are so afraid
of your misdeeds being exposed,

70
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,719
why did you resort
to such despicable means?

71
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,360
I hope you remember the lesson of today.

72
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,319
From now on,

73
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,360
act prudently.

74
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,000
Madam.

75
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,080
Madam,

76
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,960
what's wrong?

77
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,719
Madam,

78
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,319
what happened to you?

79
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
Madam.

80
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,520
No.

81
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,080
How could this happen?

82
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,879
If there is poison in it,

83
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,240
why would she eat it?

84
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,599
It's a lethal poison,

85
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,840
a deadly one.

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,560
Why did she eat that bowl of soup?

87
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,639
Tell me!

88
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,920
It was the marquise.

89
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,040
She was forcing my lady to eat it.

90
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,639
Matriarch,

91
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,360
I didn't know that soup...

92
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,600
You wicked murderer!

93
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,959
Matriarch, please calm down.

94
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,720
We should find out the truth first.

95
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,120
My mother
is such a clever and cautious person.

96
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
How could she force people
to drink poison?

97
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
The bowl of soup was given
to me by her servant.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,360
I dared not drink it
so I handed it to her.

99
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,000
You mean she drank the poison herself?

100
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,439
Is she that stupid?

101
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,240
Knowingly drank the poison.

102
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,600
Yes.

103
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,439
If she knew it was poison,

104
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,800
why would she drink it herself?

105
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,519
If she did drink it,

106
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,560
how could it be lethal poison?

107
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,120
It was your threat

108
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,199
that forced my lady to death.

109
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,120
Matriarch, please do justice to my lady.

110
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,319
Since my mother said

111
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,279
the soup was brought
by the maid of the madam.

112
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,839
Find the maid, and everything

113
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,560
will be clear as soon as she shows up.

114
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,399
Come in.

115
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,399
It was the madam

116
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,920
who asked me to drug the soup

117
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,839
and send it to the marquise.

118
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,319
How dare you

119
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,560
kill people!

120
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,000
I didn't.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,360
This is just a laxative.

122
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,639
Madam just wanted her to feel unwell.

123
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,199
She wouldn't kill anyone.

124
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,399
Just a laxative?

125
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,720
How could it be just a laxative?

126
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,240
It's absolutely true.

127
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,120
I can swear on my parents' life.

128
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,360
I get it now.

129
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,319
You knew the stupid lady
gave you a laxative.

130
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,560
You were furious

131
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,240
and wanted to kill her,

132
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,920
so you put poison in it
and forced her to eat it.

133
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,279
And now you're acting
as if she fell for her own trap.

134
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,040
What smart calculation!

135
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,040
How wicked you are!

136
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,040
Guards!

137
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,399
Lock her up.

138
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,639
Matriarch.

139
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,199
What is it?

140
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,600
This time,

141
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,639
you want to order your men

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,319
to hit me?

143
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,120
The madam's dying now,

144
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,560
and I'm partly responsible for it.

145
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,199
Don't worry.

146
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,759
Before the truth is ascertained,

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,319
I will collaborate.

148
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,000
But

149
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,319
before I am locked up,

150
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,519
I want to see my son,

151
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,959
Rong Xiu.

152
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,959
I'm okay with being locked up alone.

153
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,199
Why do you bother to accompany me?

154
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,120
Did you visit the madam
before you came here?

155
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,439
She hasn't woken up yet.

156
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,600
The doctor said

157
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,839
he'd do his best
and leave the rest to fate.

158
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,920
Don't blame yourself.

159
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,560
It was her who wanted to harm you first.

160
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,959
It was an accident.

161
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,720
It was not an accident.

162
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,360
It was a plot against me.

163
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,639
Then why did you agree
to the matriarch's punishment?

164
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,399
She played the game so well.

165
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,240
I should cooperate with her.

166
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,920
Mother, you want to see me?

167
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,879
I am punished and confined here.

168
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,560
Let's just talk like this.

169
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,680
Yes.

170
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,920
My son,

171
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,199
ancient people laid on ice
and cut their flesh

172
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,600
to get food for their mothers.

173
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,759
I've encountered such misfortune,

174
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,759
and you're indifferent?

175
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,360
I'm incapable.

176
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,800
I don't know what to do.

177
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,040
Then you just watch me

178
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,439
suffer like this?

179
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,519
Do not forget.

180
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,519
As the general's son, you must observe
filial rituals for three years.

181
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,199
Only then can you inherit the title.

182
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,879
Then

183
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,079
what do you want me to do?

184
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,240
Kneel for me in front
of the matriarch's room

185
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,639
and kowtow every day

186
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,879
until she forgives me.

187
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,000
What do you think?

188
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:31,879
Well...

189
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,480
My good son,
