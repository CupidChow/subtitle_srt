00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:11,040
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,640
Fish! Fresh fish!

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,519
Sir, how about a fish?

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,599
It's very fresh.

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,800
Mr. Wang, nice to see you.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,440
Where is Mrs. Wang?

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,480
She's doing the laundry.

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,600
Give me one.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,839
Have you heard?

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,039
There's quite a commotion
in the Rong family.

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:24,960
Yes, I have.

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,000
The new marquise, who married
into their family not long ago,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,600
had a child with her stepson.

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,320
It's more than that.

15
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,559
They say that woman
has been married three times before.

16
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:32,679
She's really shameless.

17
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,079
It really fits the saying

18
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,520
that only the stone lions
in front of their mansion are clean.

19
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,719
Such a promiscuous woman

20
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,439
should be drowned

21
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,679
or bludgeoned to death.

22
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,719
Otherwise, who knows
how many more people she will harm?

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,399
Right?

24
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:43,920
Exactly.

25
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,640
Indeed.

26
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,359
Yes.

27
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,039
That's the fact.

28
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,560
I was victimized
by Rong Xiu and Xue Lingyi.

29
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,719
=Episode 22=

30
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,600
Matriarch,

31
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,119
don't listen to her nonsense.

32
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,520
It's not like that at all.

33
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,840
Shut up.

34
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,120
The facts are all here.

35
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,319
Please be fair, matriarch.

36
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,879
What do you mean the facts are all here?

37
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,359
Your words alone are the facts?

38
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,560
Xiu, tell us

39
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,840
what exactly the truth is.

40
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,840
Ancestors in heaven,

41
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,159
your unfilial descendant, Rong Xiu,

42
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,599
is kneeling in front of you.

43
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,959
I am naive,

44
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,159
and I was deceived

45
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,480
by Xue Wan'er and Xue Lingyi.

46
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,560
Xue Wan'er

47
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,280
seduced me before.

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,159
I fell into their trap
as I was considering

49
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,840
the issue of having an heir.

50
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,359
So,

51
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,120
it was the two sisters
who deceived you together,

52
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,120
and you didn't know at all.

53
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,200
I was also a victim.

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,599
In that case, Rong Xiu,
you really can't judge people.

55
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,200
Reflect in your room for three days.

56
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,799
From now on, think twice before you act.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't tarnish our family's reputation.

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

59
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,560
Yes.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,039
Fine.

61
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,039
So today,

62
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:36,599
you are not here
to distinguish right from wrong.

63
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,319
You are here to put on
a show together, right?

64
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,400
What are you laughing at?

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,400
What am I laughing at?

66
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,879
I'm laughing at you guys
for not telling right from wrong.

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm laughing at your lies
and covering up for each other.

68
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,479
You! You are not only licentious

69
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,680
but also spouting nonsense
and insulting ancestors.

70
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,000
Guards! Drag her down and deal with her
according to family law.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,080
Who dares to touch me?

72
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,879
Don't you understand?

73
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,240
The truth is not important
to our family.

74
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,000
This whole thing started because of you.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,439
It's been blown out of proportion.

76
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,400
Now, only by dealing with you

77
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,360
can we calm the storm

78
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,199
and restore our family's reputation.

79
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,759
Dealing with me? How?

80
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,560
You...

81
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,360
You want to kill me for my silence.

82
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,560
You want to kill me to bury the truth.

83
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,719
Matriarch,

84
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,120
you're also a mother.

85
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,560
Yu and I are mother and son
with a connected heart.

86
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,680
Is it wrong for me
to return to Rong's mansion for him?

87
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,319
Is it a crime that I just want
to protect my child at all costs?

88
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,480
Why does your Rong family
have to treat me this way?

89
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,000
Why do you treat a mother
who loves her son like this?

90
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,000
Matriarch,

91
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,720
don't you even care a bit
about blood and kinship?

92
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,279
You're not guilty.

93
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,360
And you didn't do anything wrong.

94
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,480
It's our family

95
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,079
that owes you.

96
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,439
But

97
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,079
this is for the dignity
and honor of the Rong family.

98
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,560
If the general becomes aware of this,
it will be troublesome.

99
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,160
I'll send someone to pass a message
to the royal concubine in the palace

100
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,920
and ask her for help

101
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,600
to let the general stay in the palace
for three days.

102
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,639
Okay.

103
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,040
Then we must take care
of Xue Wan'er within three days

104
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,560
without a trace.

Madam?

110
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,240
Madam?

111
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,399
Madam?

112
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:11,879
Madam?

113
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,759
Madam?

114
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,199
Du Juan,

115
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,519
I'm here.

116
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,839
They locked me up.

117
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,959
I tried my best to get out.

118
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,160
I heard...

119
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,639
I heard

120
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,759
you haven't eaten or drunk for two days.

121
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,839
I was so afraid...

122
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,480
I was so afraid I was too late.

123
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,560
I'm still alive.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,199
Miss, what should I do?

125
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,759
The general hasn't returned.

126
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,839
They must have managed to delay him.

127
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,879
Go to the Gong family for help.

128
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,600
Master Gong loves his daughter, so he did wrong.

129
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,360
But Madam Gong is virtuous,
and I believe her.

130
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,680
But, Miss,

131
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,199
you haven't eaten for two days.

132
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,120
Don't worry.

133
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,560
For Yu,

134
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,040
I will survive.

135
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,680
Xue Wan'er is fine inside.

136
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,399
Madam Gong, don't slander us.

137
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,360
We haven't abused her.

138
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,199
But she, as the general's wife,
had improper conduct.

139
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,959
This issue relates
to the reputation of our family.

140
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:54,240
You can see her,
but you can't take her away.

141
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,160
My poor child!

142
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,959
I heard it all. You have suffered.

143
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,639
Miss.

144
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,600
- Quickly.
- Quickly.

145
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,079
Take it easy.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
Slow down.
I just took these from the kitchen.

147
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,680
I still have a lot here.

148
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,560
You took them from the kitchen?

149
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,160
Why are the leftover pastries
from the kitchen

150
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,560
still so warm?

151
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,360
The people of the Rong family
want me dead.

152
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,519
How could they just

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,080
let you stay in the same room with me?

154
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,399
It's poisonous.

155
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,559
The people of the Rong family
are determined to get me killed,

156
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,519
yet they're afraid

157
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,080
to take on the crime
of murdering the marquise.

158
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,960
So they came up with such an idea.

159
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,200
The pastries were brought by you.

160
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,759
Even if this gets to the officials,

161
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,840
they can escape the blame.

162
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,799
How malicious they are!

163
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,360
Don't eat these.

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
Mother,

165
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,000
if I don't eat these,

166
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm afraid

167
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
I won't be able
to wait for the general to return.

168
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,879
