1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,599
Was it that poor hunter who seduced you?

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,119
We hit it off at first sight

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:15,839
and fell in love.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,519
Secret contact is forbidden.

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,839
You have no shame. Hit her.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,879
We're both unmarried,

7
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,839
and we are in love.

8
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,359
Why can't we be husband and wife?

9
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,079
Living together without a matchmaker

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,439
is against etiquette. Hit her.

11
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,840
I've never seen someone so stubborn.

12
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,920
You should just back down
and beg for mercy.

13
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,520
Just say you are wrong.

14
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,759
I am wrong.

15
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,439
My mistake
is being born in the Xue Family,

16
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,640
and being in the same clan as you.

17
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,519
Parents love their children,
so children respect them.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,840
Parents raise their children,
so children revere them.

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,680
But my parents died when I was young.

20
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,640
You put me in a woodshed
and left me cold and hungry.

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,239
You divided my property
in the name of relatives.

22
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,879
You didn't raise me

23
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,760
or take care of me.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,879
You don't deserve to be my family.

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,359
You are my enemies, feasting on my body.

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,879
Beat her to death!

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,120
Beat her to death!

28
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,959
Xue Wan'er met a man by stealth,

29
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,760
ruining the family's reputation.

30
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,120
She is to be beaten to death.

31
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,760
Hit her!

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,920
Hit her!

33
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,280
Hit her!

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,159
Hit her!

35
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,519
Hit her!

36
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,280
The young lady is back.

37
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,480
The young lady is back from the capital.

38
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,680
Go.

39
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,799
Let's go outside to take a look

40
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,879
and welcome her.

41
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,080
Let's go. Hurry up.

42
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:19,392
=Wise Woman=

43
00:02:21,802 --> 00:02:28,103
=Episode 1=
(Xue Wan'er)

44
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,759
There's a fire!

45
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,680
Go over there.

46
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,199
Let's both go!

47
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,520
I heard a sound over there.

48
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,560
Should we go take a look?

49
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,919
It doesn't matter.

50
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,080
Yi,

51
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,120
you must carry the secret prescription

52
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,560
we got for you on you
after burning incense and bathing

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,439
every day.

54
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,759
Only with fervent prayers
will it be effective.

55
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,600
This is the prescription

56
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,120
(Xue Lingyi)
you called me in such a hurry

57
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,519
to give me?

58
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,560
Yes.

59
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,879
(The Xue Family Patriarch)

60
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,519
We spent a fortune

61
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,000
and many years of searching on this.

62
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,560
It represents the wishes
of our entire family.

63
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,360
It can surely help you have a child

64
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,199
and establish a foothold
in Rong's mansion.

65
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,600
That's right.

66
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
Okay.

67
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,839
Thank you all.

68
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,560
You are the glory of our family.

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,920
We care about you,

70
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,120
and you must care about us.

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,319
Of course.

72
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,959
I won't fail your expectations.

73
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,199
Good girl.

74
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,319
Yi, you should go to bed early.

75
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,480
Go to bed.

76
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,680
We're leaving.

77
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,879
Such a good child.

78
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,720
A bunch of old fools.

79
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,439
(Which maid)

80
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,560
(has the nerve to steal from my room?)

81
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,360
The mansion was in an uproar just now,

82
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,759
as if a thief had entered.

83
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,399
I'm scared.

84
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,959
All of you come closer and stand guard.

85
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,600
Yes.

86
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,519
How could I be so clumsy?

87
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,240
Who put the brazier here?

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,759
Lady, are you alright?

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What's wrong?

90
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,600
I'm okay. Come in to clean up later

91
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,040
so as not to burn other servants.

92
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,519
Lingyi.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,519
Wan'er?

94
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,639
It cannot be wrong.

95
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Are you sure?

96
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,319
She's only one month pregnant,
so it's not noticeable.

97
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,480
I told you before

98
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,720
about surrogacy.

99
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,360
A child born with another woman
gets put under your name.

100
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,639
Isn't your position then stable?

101
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,079
(So this is God's prescription
for me to have a baby?)

102
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,040
This matter must be kept secret,

103
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,560
especially from her.

104
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,720
I'll take my leave.

105
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,920
Wan'er.

106
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,920
Wan'er,

107
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,800
my poor little sister.

108
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,360
I've been in the capital for many years,

109
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,279
unaware that you've been suffering.

110
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,800
While we are not full sisters,

111
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,279
we are kin after all.

112
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,600
Don't worry.

113
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,759
As long as I'm here,

114
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,879
I'll certainly protect you.

115
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,199
Lingyi.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,480
I heard

117
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,639
your husband passed away in the war.

118
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,960
You are now alone and helpless.

119
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,240
Wan'er,

120
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,480
come with me to the capital.

121
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,759
Madam, you're back.

122
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,440
Madam, the room is ready.

123
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,519
This is my husband's summer house.

124
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,759
It's usually vacant.

125
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,840
You can live here.

126
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Are you okay?

127
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,559
I'm fine.

128
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,840
It's normal to feel a bit uncomfortable
from the exhaustion of traveling.

129
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,399
Let's go in and rest.

130
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,759
Come over here.

131
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,360
Put the luggage here.

132
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,519
Are you tired?

133
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,879
Change into comfortable clothes
and get some rest.

134
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:05,407
(Qing Manor)

135
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,919
My dear, you're finally back.

136
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,080
Are you playing hard to get with me?

137
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Who are you?

138
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,600
(Rong Xiu)
What a disrespectful maid!

139
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,840
I'm not a maid.

140
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,720
Wan'er, there's a misunderstanding.

141
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,559
This is your brother-in-law,

142
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,840
Rong Xiu.

143
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,000
Hello,

144
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Wan'er.

145
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,600
This is the person
I care about the most.

146
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,159
You must be nice to her.

147
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,919
Of course.

148
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,360
(Qing Manor)

149
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,080
Our cooks make cuisine from the capital.

150
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,759
I guess you wouldn't be used to it,

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,679
so I made

152
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,360
a few local dishes myself.

153
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,320
I might not have done well.

154
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,559
I'm not sure if they suit your taste.

155
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,799
Eat it.

156
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,600
After my parents passed away,

157
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,000
you were the kindest relative to me.

158
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,519
Fool, I am your elder sister.

159
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,679
Lingyi.

160
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,080
Wine is really a wonderful thing.

161
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,720
Once swallowed,

162
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,120
all the melancholy can be forgotten.

163
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,919

164
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,440
