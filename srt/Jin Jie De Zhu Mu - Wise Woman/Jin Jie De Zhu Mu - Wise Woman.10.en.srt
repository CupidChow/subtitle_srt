00:00:06,404 --> 00:00:11,258
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,800
Ladies, greetings.

3
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,519
You have been very idle lately.

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,160
With her husband
serving the marquise every day

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,719
and not having to raise the child,

6
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,079
isn't it normal that she's idle?

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,160
I heard that
the Gong family is raising Yu,

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,640
and they're doing quite well.

9
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,759
Now, for the sake of Yu,

10
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,799
the Gongs and the matriarch
have also harmonized a lot.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,320
It seems like

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,280
it really is a good thing
that brings multiple benefits.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,960
Well, the marquise...

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,960
No,

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,920
I should call her mother now.

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,439
Mother is really thoughtful.

17
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:53,600
She knows quite a lot
about taking care of children.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,679
She talks about childbirth
with the wet nurse like an expert,

19
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,359
as if she had really given birth.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,840
How could a maiden like her
have given birth?

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,679
But what if

22
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,159
she's not a maiden?

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,959
I'm just joking.

24
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,280
But that day at the Gong's mansion,

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,799
Master Gong was against it,

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,439
but his daughter suddenly spoke
from behind the screen,

27
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,560
voluntarily agreeing to marry in.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Isn't that strange?

29
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:35,959
Nonsense.

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,280
=Episode 10=
How can we let someone

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,959
in the palace examine her?

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,359
I'm just worried.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,079
If she were not a virgin,

34
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,120
that would be really absurd,

35
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,280
and it would disgrace
our family forever.

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,159
Are you worried

37
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,719
that if the marquise is wronged,

38
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,040
the Gong family will make trouble?

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,200
That won't be a problem.
As long as we think of a way

40
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,120
not to tell her
it's a physical examination,

41
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,719
it will be fine.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,879
(For the sake of the Rong family,
I have no choice but to do so.)

43
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,756
(Rong's Mansion)

44
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,960
Matriarch.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,080
This is Ms. Song from the palace.

46
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,439
She specializes in keeping up
the health of noble people

47
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,800
and treating gynaecological diseases.

48
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,479
Greetings, Ms. Song.

49
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,680
Greetings, Madam.

50
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,639
Today, I am feeling unwell.

51
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,080
It really cost me to ask Ms. Song
to personally come to my mansion.

52
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,919
Since she has come,

53
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,120
it is a blessing for all of you.

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
She'll have a look at each of you later.

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,199
I don't feel ill myself.

56
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:54,879
Maybe...

57
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,319
You're still young.

58
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,000
You might not feel anything right now.

59
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,120
We still need to have you examined.

60
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,080
Even if you're healthy,

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,960
she could still help
improve your constitution.

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,719
Moreover, all the daughters-in-law
in the family

63
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,360
will be individually examined.

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,080
If we skip you,

65
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,360
I'm afraid your parents
would accuse me of bias.

66
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,960
Yes.

67
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,319
Madam, please follow me.

68
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,080
Right now?

69
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,400
Yes.

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,280
Ms. Song has come all the way
from the palace.

71
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,520
Do you expect her
to wait for your free time?

72
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,319
Go.

73
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,039
Let Rong Xiu find out more
about this woman.

74
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,759
That woman
is not a gynecology expert at all.

75
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,360
She specially examines the maids
in the palace.

76
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,840
Where are they now?

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,319
At the back of the matriarch's place.

78
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,599
In a secluded room.

79
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,599
They say they invited her

80
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,759
to treat each of our ladies.

81
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,479
They are targeting Xue Wan'er.

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,599
Why would the matriarch
suddenly have such suspicions?

83
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,879
The tools you use for treatment
are really strange.

84
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,199
These

85
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,360
are all secret methods
not disclosed outside the palace.

86
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,199
Please, madam, remove your clothes.

87
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,839
Do I have to?

88
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,519
They've been on guard
against us all along.

89
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,279
My lady!

90
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,879
It's to check on your virginity.

91
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,319
Move!

92
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,160
Do you think you can stop me?

93
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,600
Stop it!

94
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,720
Ever since you were scolded
by the matriarch for filial impiety,

95
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,240
nowadays you do whatever
the marquise says.

96
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,959
You probably don't even know
what has happened.

97
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,120
If it hadn't been for her guilt,

98
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,759
why would she have sent her maid
to get help?

99
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,519
Guard the door for me.

100
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,439
No one can go in or out

101
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,879
without a result.

102
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,680
She's so nervous.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
It seems like there really is a problem.

104
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,439
If it turns out
that she's not really a virgin,

105
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,480
with so many people in this courtyard,

106
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,319
the news probably can't be kept secret.

107
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,639
Then she will be taken care of.

108
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,199
It seems that you have
made up your mind.

109
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,279
I have something
to say to you in person.

110
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,959
What a big show.

111
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,399
It seems that you have already

112
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,759
set this trumped-up charge up
for me early on.

113
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,360
If you are not guilty,

114
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,240
why resist?

115
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,319
If you don't resist,

116
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,040
the matriarch won't have you locked.

117
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,839
I am a new bride,

118
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,600
but I am suspected by my mother-in-law.

119
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,480
She let the servants guard the door,
forcing me to have my virginity checked

120
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,160
in front of so many people.

121
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,160
I'm innocent,

122
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
but I suffer such humiliation.

123
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,759
Why can't I resist?

124
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,560
You make sense.

125
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
But now that it has come to this,

126
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,199
even if I believe you,

127
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,800
how can I stop the rumors in the crowd?

128
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,199
For your reputation

129
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,759
and the reputation of the Rong family,

130
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,959
you have to be examined.

131
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,360
Since you insist on this,

132
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,920
then

133
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,480
let them examine me.

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,839
Wait.

135
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,120
Matriarch, since you are here,

136
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,759
why don't you oversee the process
of this examination yourself?
