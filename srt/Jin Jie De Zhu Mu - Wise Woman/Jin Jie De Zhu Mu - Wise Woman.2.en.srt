00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:11,229
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:14,344
(One month later)

3
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:27,199
Beauty, you're here.

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,199
I'm here to take your life.

5
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,799
Didn't I tell you not
to come to the manor again?

6
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:34,679
Wan'er.

7
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,159
It's been a month.

8
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,799
Get out.

9
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,079
Wan'er, it was all my fault.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,200
All my fault.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,840
I shouldn't have brought you
to the manor.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,039
If it wasn't for me,

13
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,719
how would my husband get drunk and...

14
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,079
I understand your grudge.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,280
If you must,

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,039
then take my life.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,039
Besides,

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,520
the doctor said yesterday

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,200
you have already carried his child.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,879
I won't keep it.

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,840
Wan'er!

22
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,200
Lingyi.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,079
Don't hurt yourself.

24
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,599
I can't.

25
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,879
I can't keep this child.

26
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,920
Promise me.

27
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:23,000
Keep this child.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,840
If anything happens to you,

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,560
I'll be right behind you.

30
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,599
Do it for me.

31
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,400
Keep this child.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,719
If you must,

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,879
then take my life.

34
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:05,396
=Episode 2=

35
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,919
Is it you?

36
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,319
I knew you'd come back.

37
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,479
I knew you'd definitely come back.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,840
They said the army you joined

39
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,800
was wiped out in the first battle.

40
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,360
But I don't believe it.

41
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,199
I don't believe it at all.

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,199
Wake up.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,960
Don't faint. Wake up.

44
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,240
Push harder.

45
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,080
Very good. Come on.

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,120
Hot water.

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,639
Get a new tub of water.

48
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,879
Hurry. Take a deep breath.

49
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,879
Good. It's almost out.

50
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,280
Push harder.

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,039
Put the medicine here.

52
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,599
Give me a clean cloth.

53
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,879
Change the water.

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,439
I can see the head.

55
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,719
It's out.

56
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,199
Get more haemostatic cloths.

57
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,000
Hurry up.

58
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,879
It's out.

59
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,080
It's a boy.

60
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,000
How joyous this is.

61
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,120
Look at him.

62
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,720
Doesn't the child look exactly
like the young master?

63
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,000
Look at his face.

64
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,839
His eyebrows are exactly alike.

65
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,720
(Rong's Mansion)
That's great!

66
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
You gave me a grandson

67
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,040
without even telling me in advance.

68
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,279
Thank you, Matriarch.

69
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,439
It's a real blessing for our family.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,040
(Mrs. Wu)
Shameless.

71
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,560
(of the Eldest Branch)
She is barren

72
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,279
and has arranged
a substitute for her man!

73
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,920
(Mrs. Rong of the Third Branch)
Great.

74
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,240
She has a son.

75
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,040
Now Matriarch can't kick
her out of the house.

76
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,560
And to make matters worse,

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,319
not only will she not get divorced,

78
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,639
but she will also be
in charge of the Rong Family.

79
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,839
Matriarch,

80
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,519
it is but a humble-born son.

81
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,240
He can't be the heir.

82
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,680
The heir to their family property

83
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,199
must be her own son.

84
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,718
(Matriarch Rong)

85
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,959
I have promised Lingyi

86
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,759
to register the child under her name

87
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,040
as their legitimate son.

88
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,120
Thank you, Matriarch.

89
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,319
I have already sent a letter
to our family head.

90
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,040
Once they arrive tomorrow,
bring the child over.

91
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,120
A ceremony will be held
at the ancestral temple.

92
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,480
Lady, don't sit there.

93
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,199
The stone is cold. Please rise.

94
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,399
You just gave birth.

95
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,120
A woman has to take good care of herself

96
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,920
after childbirth.

97
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,319
Lady,

98
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,120
you came here for prenatal care.

99
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,879
We were specifically warned not
to ask too much about your affairs.

100
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,040
But please allow me to ask.

101
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,319
Why hasn't the father of the child

102
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,000
ever come to see you?

103
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,000
I didn't come here for prenatal care.

104
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
I got pregnant

105
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,279
after I came here.

106
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,639
It's weird.

107
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,920
We were told to prepare
nourishment for gestation

108
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,439
before you'd been here for a month.

109
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,560
But it would take at least a month

110
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,399
to know of a pregnancy.

111
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,519
What does it mean?

112
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,439
Are you saying

113
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,199
if the pregnancy is confirmed,

114
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,639
the woman must have been pregnant
for over a month?

115
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,319
Yeah.

116
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,639
I've had several children.

117
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,879
That's what many doctors

118
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,199
I've seen told me.

119
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,199
My lady,

120
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,360
do you remember when you had

121
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
your first morning sickness?

122
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,480
Are you okay?

123
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,480
They tricked me!

124
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,480
The baby...

125
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,480
The baby is my husband's.

126
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,279
My beloved,

127
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,319
we have a baby.

128
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:01,728
(Qing Manor)

129
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,839
Someone!

130
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,519
Something's wrong. Help!

131
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,439
What happened?

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Something's wrong.

133
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,399
Just now...

134
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,399
Just now, someone saw
Xue Wan'er taking the baby away.

135
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,319
It seems she knew the truth.

136
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,399
She must die.

137
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,799
Wan'er has run off with a man.

138
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,799
Wan'er has run off with a man.

139
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,840
It's young master's people.

140
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,480
Going to them will only kill you faster.

141
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,200
No, he doesn't know the baby isn't his.

142
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,840
Xue Lingyi deceived him.

143
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,519
Rong Xiu, I'm here.

144
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,879
Xue Wan'er!

145
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,519
Yu!

146
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,399
Rong Xiu,

147
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,799
didn't you hear what the servants said?

148
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,200
She ran away to elope with a man.

149
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,039
The ceremony for the baby's inclusion
in the genealogy is tomorrow.

150
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,320
Do you want our elders to know

151
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
that the child has
such a promiscuous mother

152
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,720
and want to complicate matters?

153
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,240
You're right.

154
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,600
The ceremony is more important.

155
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,799
This dissolute woman.

156
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,559
Dispose of her.

157
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,840
How unbelievable.

158
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,240
How shameless.

159
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,000
Beat her to death.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,679
Hit her.

161
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,240
How shameless she is.

162
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,080
Geez.

163
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,120
Oh my goodness.

164
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,519
- Smash her.
- Smash her.

165
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,000
Smash her hard.

166
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,399
How disgusting.

167
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,639
- So impure.
- Yeah.

168
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,879
Smash her.

169
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,399
Mother, she's too pitiful.

170
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,240
Let's not do it.

171
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,399
Pitiful?

172
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,720
She did such a shameful thing.

173
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,840
Go. Don't look anymore.

174
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,720
Hit her.

175
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,200
Let her learn a lesson.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,919
Today, the grandson Rong Tingyu

177
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,840
is recorded in the family genealogy.

178
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,480
Father is Rong Xiu.

179
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,399
Mother is

180
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,879
Xue Lingyi, Rong Xiu's legitimate wife.

181
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,399
Congratulations, Xiu.

182
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,600
Congratulations.

183
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,440
Congratulations.

184
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,159
He's lucky

185
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,240
to be your son.

186
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,080
You are really flattering me.

187
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,200
The child is really good.

188
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,879
Look.

189
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,039
He's a blessed baby.
