you can no longer be Xue Wan'er.

I insist on having it both ways.

Matriarch had the daughter
of the Gong Family marry into our family

36
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,319
because she wanted her

37
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,759
to have a legitimate son

You suspected me of infidelity
without listening to my explanation,

to compensate you.

87
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,079
Kill me.

88
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,040

to be the father of your child.

these days?

97
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,240
I was rescued by the Gong Family.

98
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,360
My sister asked me
to marry in place of Miss Gong.

99
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,360
Xue Lingyi knew it all along?

100
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,360
Then why did she keep it from me?

101
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,879
Maybe my sister

102
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,639
didn't want you to see me.

103
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,480
(This venomous woman...)

104
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,519
Now, you've married
into the Rong Family.

105
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,040
We can be together now.

106
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,839
I thought that was the case.

107
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,079
I'm already in the Rong Family,

108
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,639
yet my sister tried every means
to prevent me from seeing my child.

109
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,319
If I can't see my child,

110
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,839
what's the point of me staying here?

111
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:46,920
In fact...

112
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,959
I wish...

113
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,959
I wish that I can

114
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,759
keep my child by my side rightfully.

115
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,040
Actually, there is an opportunity now.

116
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,279
What opportunity?

117
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,439
Didn't the matriarch ask you

118
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,480
to pick someone
from my generation of the Rong Family

119
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,160
to adopt for the general?

120
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,839
You mean

121
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,240
you want to be my son?

122
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,879
Yes.

123
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,720
Right. In this way,

124
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,279
my child could also be included
in the general's lineage.

125
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,680
As the marquise,

126
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,800
I could take care of him rightfully.

127
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,720
But in this way,

128
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,560
won't my sister be unhappy?

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,959
After all,

130
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,600
she doesn't like us getting too close.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,279
