1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,093
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,800
It's his fault.

3
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,800
He took our child away.

4
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,440
Don't come.

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,439
Young master.

6
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,000
Young master, please save the madam.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,600
The madam has been locked in the manor.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,119
She's very sick.

9
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,119
Tell her not to bother me.

10
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,119
Go away.

11
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,000
Wait.

12
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:47,679
Young master.

13
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,600
I will go see her now.

14
00:00:56,526 --> 00:01:00,518
=Episode 20=

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,439
Lingyi.

16
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,640
You finally came to see me.

17
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,079
I thought you abandoned me.

18
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,519
We've been a couple for so long.

19
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,239
How could I possibly give you up?

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,560
My lord,

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,879
take me away.

22
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,599
I don't want to stay here anymore.

23
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,719
Take me away.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,560
I can take you away,

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,120
but

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
you should sign this first.

27
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,959
(Confession Letter)

28
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,079
Confession letter?

29
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,920
All the above things
were done by me alone

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,319
and have nothing to do with others.

31
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,359
Rong Xiu.

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,640
So that's why you came to see me.

33
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,879
The general is back.

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,680
He is a ruthless killer
on the battlefield.

35
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,359
If he knows about this,

36
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,759
he won't let us off.

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,319
I am your husband.

38
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,000
Save me.

39
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,680
Please save me.

40
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,080
In the past,

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,400
you just thought of
your own glory and wealth.

42
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,159
Now you are only
thinking of your own safety.

43
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,479
Have you ever thought about me

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,680
for a bit?

45
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,000
I will not be so silly again.

46
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,680
Today,

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,439
you must sign it

48
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,879
whether you want to or not.

49
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,000
I will sign it.

50
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,639
Catch her!

51
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,199
Catch her!

52
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Let me go!

53
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,560
Let me go!

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
Take her back.

55
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,120
General,
this is Xue Lingyi's confession letter.

56
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,840
All the crimes listed here

57
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,800
were committed by her alone.

58
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,039
She's your wife.

59
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,319
What does her wrongdoing
have to do with me?

60
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,400
She admitted it herself.

61
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,480
She admitted it herself.

62
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,959
She maliciously plotted against
the biological mother of Yu.

63
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,759
What?

64
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,959
Yu's biological mother is so pitiful.

65
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,720
It was Xue Lingyi

66
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,839
who proposed to take
the child from his biological mother,

67
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,120
in order to secure
her position in this mansion.

68
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,759
It was she who drugged that woman.

69
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,600
And it was she who wanted that woman

70
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,959
to be dead.

71
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,959
All her crimes

72
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,160
are clearly listed in the paper.

73
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,279
She is the culprit.

74
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,079
The crimes were committed by her.

75
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,519
You are really venomous!

76
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,680
Evildoer!

77
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,279
You set me up!

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Aunt,

79
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,000
with such a wife,

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,360
I am not worthy to raise Yu anymore.

81
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,439
Aunt, may I burden you

82
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,560
to raise

83
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,639
the child

84
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,720
for me?

85
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,160
Alright,

86
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,959
it will be done as you said.

87
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,079
But are you really going to let Yu

88
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,600
have such an evil mother nominally?

89
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,240
General.

90
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,800
You're right.

91
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,600
Xue Lingyi is

92
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,160
unforgivable.

93
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,079
Today, I will divorce her.

94
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,439
Get me

95
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,519
a divorce letter!

96
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,680
Bring me one!

97
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,560
Divorce letter!

98
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,800
Someone!

99
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,959
Someone, get her out of here.

100
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,399
From today on,

101
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,120
she no longer has any relationship

102
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,240
with our family.
