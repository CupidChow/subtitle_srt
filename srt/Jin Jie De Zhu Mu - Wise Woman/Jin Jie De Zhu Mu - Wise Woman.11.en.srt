1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,199
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,320
What's this?

3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,519
This is about placing a charcoal brazier
under a woman's legs

4
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,079
and then lightly touching her nose
with pepper or a feather

5
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,880
to make her sneeze.

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,039
If sparks fly
from the charcoal brazier below,

7
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,840
that woman is not a virgin anymore.

8
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,799
If no sparks fly
from the charcoal brazier,

9
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,159
she is still a virgin.

10
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,400
=Episode 11=
Why is it taking so long?

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,640
The matriarch came out.

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,400
The marquise

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,359
is indeed a virgin.

14
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,079
Dismissed.

15
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,359
Dear,

16
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,799
aren't you waiting
for your mother-in-law?

17
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:58,879
What?

18
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,239
I have cleared my name.

19
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,519
Aren't you happy?

20
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,159
I...

21
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,400
I am glad.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,360
Xiu, can you guess

23
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,879
why the matriarch

24
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,280
suddenly became suspicious of me

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,000
and who is instigating this whole thing
from behind?

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,039
I...

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,199
You were trying to put me
in a deadly situation.

28
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,919
But why don't you care at all

29
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,560
whether your husband's title
will be lost?

30
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,800
Master,

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,439
I...

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,639
You wretch!

33
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,000
My lady, how did this
suddenly take a turn?

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,560
I thought we would be exposed.

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,840
I was scared to death.

36
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,199
These old slickers from the palace

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,520
naturally have ways to fake it.

38
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,639
Since you're not willing
to remove your clothes,

39
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,159
I have to do it myself.

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,599
I am the marquise.

41
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,120
How dare you touch me?

42
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,000
You hit me?

43
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,360
I have a way.

44
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
I will tell them

45
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,439
that you suddenly wanted
to undress me and humiliate me,

46
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,319
and I was flustered,

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,159
so I picked up a bottle

48
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,199
and killed you

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,080
by accident.

50
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,400
How is it?

51
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,439
You...

52
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,280
You wouldn't dare.

53
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,159
But I have no other choice.

54
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,319
Don't worry.

55
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,840
There are so many people
outside the window.

56
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,039
They must have received the order

57
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,120
that no matter what happens inside,

58
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
they can't burst in.

59
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,120
So

60
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,919
this is a great opportunity.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,759
I have a way.

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,759
I have a way to help you through this.

63
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,159
Actually,

64
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,520
we just need to sprinkle
a few drops of water

65
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,439
on the charcoal brazier.

66
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,159
This body examination method

67
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,599
is just a game of bluff.

68
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,439
It's groundless.

69
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,719
But those wealthy, prestigious families
care about this.

70
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,399
And it has made
many innocent women suffer.

71
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,000
Since you are

72
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,360
willing to help me through this,

73
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,000
we are on the same side.

74
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,040
Don't worry.

75
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,279
I will repay you.

76
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,839
I think

77
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,839
this is not the first time
you've profited from it.

78
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,600
You know how to keep your mouth shut

79
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,879
and the consequences
of leaking secrets, right?

80
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes.

81
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,800
I know the rules.

82
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,600
I see.

83
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,240
But I'm afraid Xue Lingyi's methods
will be more extreme

84
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,680
and harder for us to guard against.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,879
Now,

86
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,560
the seed of doubt has already
been planted in Rong Xiu's heart.

87
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,279
The thorn called Xue Lingyi

88
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,839
is about to be removed.

89
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,160
The marquise has been married
into the Rong family for some time now.

90
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,519
I want to hold a banquet

91
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,480
to invite all the noble relatives

92
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,639
and to formally introduce her
to everyone.

93
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,560
Your mother means that

94
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,399
you should be the one to arrange it.

95
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,240
It's a great opportunity to make a hit
among the noble families in the capital.

96
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,600
Your mother is really good to you.

97
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,879
Thank you so much, mother.

98
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,279
With a good daughter-in-law like you,

99
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,439
I'm really worry-free.

100
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,639
Matriarch, I'll take my leave.

101
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,600
Mother, I will see you out.

102
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,079
I'll go too.

103
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,600
Dear,

104
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,079
it takes a lot of effort
to prepare the banquet.

105
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,279
You should stay

106
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,879
and learn well from the matriarch.

107
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,160
Mother.

108
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,480
Mother,

109
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,879
your handkerchief.

110
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,319
Passing an item in private like this
is really inappropriate.

111
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,600
Then...

112
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,920
Just find a place

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,120
and throw it away.

114
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,399
I'm leaving now.

115
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,600
My lady,

116
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,639
Rong Xiu is so shameless.

117
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,319
Why would you still be so nice to him?

118
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,319
I added something to my handkerchief.

119
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,759
It's the fragrance
from the Western Regions.

120
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,360
It won't fade for ten days
after being applied.

121
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,040
You have a keen nose.

122
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,160
You should...

123
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,759
I understand.

124
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,279
This time, I will make him suffer.
