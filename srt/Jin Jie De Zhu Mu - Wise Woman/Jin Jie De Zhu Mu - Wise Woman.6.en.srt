1
00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:11,174
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,039
Stop calculating.

3
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,039
It's so noisy.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,719
Stop wandering around in front of me.

5
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,839
Stay over there.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,960
The matriarch asked Xue Wan'er
to go to the ancestral hall.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,800
What would be the result
of the discussion?

8
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,679
This is Lv Zhu requesting to see you.

9
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,199
Come in.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,000
The matriarch wants you to see her.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,159
Really?

12
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,840
To the ancestral hall?

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,880
The matter is settled!

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,479
What about me?

15
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,399
Only young master.

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,600
Please take your son there.

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,479
Okay.

18
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:49,320
Listen, the child is the best chip.

19
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,039
Don't let Xue Wan'er bring
the child to Gong's mansion.

20
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:52,880
Got it.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,680
=Episode 6=
What about the thing you promised me?

22
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,519
Well...

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,920
You haven't decided yet?

24
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,719
Then I'll tell the matriarch

25
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,879
to wait for a few more days.

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,519
It's not that.

27
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,560
It's just the child.

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,200
If we rashly send him to Gong's mansion,

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
the matriarch
will also be suspicious, won't she?

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,879
I understand now.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You're not afraid
of the matriarch's suspicion.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,599
You're suspicious of me.

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,359
I've already signed the adoption paper.

34
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,760
But you doubt me.

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,879
Then I might as well tear it up.

36
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,799
If the matriarch asks,

37
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,400
I'll just tell the truth.

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,879
What happened?

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,239
Matriarch,

40
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,599
Yu...

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,519
Yu is not feeling well today.

42
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,680
The doctor said
it was because our house is too cold.

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,000
I heard that Mr. Gong
brought hot springs

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,239
from the Yuquan Mountain
to their mansion.

45
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:04,000
So I thought about sending
my child there to recuperate.

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,079
I was just discussing it with marquise.

47
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,719
Have you handled it?

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
Yes.

49
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,759
Matriarch.

50
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's go in.

51
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,360
(Inherit the great virtues
and achievements)

52
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,479
Father,

53
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,919
I will fulfill my filial duties

54
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,280
to serve the elders and continue

55
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,159
the family line.

56
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,240
May you rest in peace in the underworld.

57
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,159
Mother.

58
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,919
Good son.

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,520
I understand your filial piety.

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,800
I have told the matriarch.

61
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,080
As long as you show
utmost filial piety to the general,

62
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,039
she agrees to let you
continue his lineage.

63
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,680
Since I'm the general's son now,

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,319
I should show my filial piety.

65
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,439
Good. Starting from today,

66
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,319
you will mourn
for the general for 100 days

67
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,599
and observe mourning rituals
for three years.

68
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,000
What?

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,960
I'm doing this for your own good.

70
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,079
Think about it. If you don't observe
the rituals for three years,

71
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,800
how are you going to convince everyone?

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,519
How will you stop other people's gossip?

73
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,560
How can you let the matriarch
believe in your sincerity?

74
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,040
Well.

75
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,639
Whether or not you can
inherit the general's title

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
depends on your performance
in the next three years.

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,360
You made it.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,759
Mourning for three years.

79
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,879
Xue Wan'er,

80
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,600
what a trick.

81
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,399
- Mother.
- Mother.

82
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,199
You should all get along well
as a family from now on.

83
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,279
Mother is kind,

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,399
not one to make things difficult for me.

85
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,160
But speaking of family...

86
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,759
Matriarch,

87
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,399
I do

88
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,079
have one thing bothering me.

89
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,600
You just said I am kind.

90
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,759
What is troubling you?

91
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,680
Why don't you ask me for help?

92
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,920
Whatever it is,

93
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,680
consult with your mother.

94
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,600
It's about our son.

95
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,399
He's so young.

96
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,600
How can he leave his own mother?

97
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,959
I've heard

98
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,240
you are not his biological mother.

99
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,079
Are you then?

100
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,480
You're a lady from a good family

101
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,839
and have never given birth to a child.

102
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,480
You don't know
a mother's love for her child.

103
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,240
I am not his biological mother,

104
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,720
but I take care of him every day.

105
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:23,519
My feelings for him are no less
than those of his biological mother.

106
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,360
Rong Xiu,

107
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,439
you said the child is weak

108
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,399
and should stay in Gong's mansion
to be recuperated by the hot springs.

109
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
But in front of the matriarch today,

110
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,759
your wife is making such a fuss.

111
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,079
I...

112
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,120
Matriarch,

113
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,879
there's something

114
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,399
I must say today.

115
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,680
Before I even became marquise,
I heard gossip saying that

116
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,639
the fourth branch of the Rong family
is under the control of Mrs. Rong

117
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,560
and that Rong Xiu

118
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,120
is henpecked.

119
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,800
What happened in the past
is none of my business.

120
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,360
But now that you have become my son,

121
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,160
become the son of the general,

122
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,959
such rumors are unacceptable.

123
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,600
Matriarch,

124
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,399
what I am saying is
for the reputation of the general

125
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,000
and the Rong Family.

126
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,959
You have a point.

127
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,360
If you change your attitude

128
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,920
as soon as your wife makes a fuss,

129
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,160
who would take you seriously
in the future?

130
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,879
Who would take the heir
of the general seriously?

131
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,040
The general was mighty and formidable,

132
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,279
how can it be allowed for people

133
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,480
to think that his successor
is a weak and timid man?

134
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,879
I'm wrong.

135
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,800
Since you know your mistake,

136
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,360
take your wife home

137
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,480
and discipline her well.

138
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes.

139
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,079
(Lingyi,)

140
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,720
(will you really not let me and Yu go?)

141
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
That's bad.

142
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,879
What should we do?

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,519
Look at you.

144
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,240
She pretended
to be innocent and pitiful,

145
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,959
and you fell into her trap.

146
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,720
Now she's your mother.
She'll take advantage of it

147
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,920
and make things hard for you.

148
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,000
But you!

149
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,600
You didn't even refute a word.

150
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,759
You're useless!

151
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
I'm useless?

152
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,879
Xue Wan'er is right.

153
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,560
I have spoiled you too much.

154
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,480
You make me lose face
in front of others,

155
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,720
making others think I'm useless.

156
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,879
I disgrace you?

157
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,279
When you needed me in the past,

158
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,879
you praised me for my cleverness

159
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,399
and relied on me to make you proud.

160
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,080
Now it has become me disgracing you!

161
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,679
You ungrateful man!

162
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,919
You heartless man!

163
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,240
Enough.

164
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,600
You hit me?

165
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,080
Xue Wan'er,

166
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,919
