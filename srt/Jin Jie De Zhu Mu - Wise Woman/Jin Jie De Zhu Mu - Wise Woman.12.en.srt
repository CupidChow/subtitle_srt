00:00:06,404 --> 00:00:11,118
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,599
Why does it smell so bad here?

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,120
Who hasn't bathed for several days?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,399
Not me. I just bathed today.

5
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,800
Definitely not me.

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,560
What? Not me. I bathe every day.

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,119
Of course it's not you.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,799
Cui, your scent is quite unique.

9
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,679
You've found that person?

10
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,600
I wouldn't miss that smell.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,960
How could Rong Xiu be obedient
and not philander with women?

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,560
But my sister must be
keeping a close eye on him.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,119
=Episode 12=
Without some tricks,

14
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:56,560
it's really hard to catch him
at the scene.

15
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,799
Be careful when moving things.

16
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,879
If you damage anything,

17
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,280
you'll never afford it in this life.

18
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,359
Sister,

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,239
don't be so nervous.

20
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,640
But I get you.

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,040
You've come step by step to this day

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,599
and used all sorts
of unspeakable methods

23
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,599
to secure the position
of a virtuous and good daughter-in-law.

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,439
You won a chance from the matriarch

25
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,159
to show your face

26
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,560
in front of the nobles in the capital.

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,400
After today,

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,280
you can rise straight to the top.

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,760
But

30
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,760
you must hold on tightly.

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,560
Otherwise,

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,159
if you climb too high,

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
a fall

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,719
can be very painful.

35
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,920
Thank you for the reminder.

36
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,840
It's just that you're overthinking.

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,680
Every step I take

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,359
is as solid as a rock.

39
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,599
There will be no mistakes.

40
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,919
Really?

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,560
Is the food and drink
to your liking today?

42
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,919
Quite to my liking.

43
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,840
It's better than my white liquor.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,120
Really?

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,919
I heard

46
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,680
the Rong family wants
to adopt a successor for the general.

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,840
Why isn't he here to greet us?

48
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,039
Right, where is Xiu?

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,599
Today's banquet
was arranged by his wife.

50
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,840
And it's held for his mother.

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,280
But

52
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,560
he vanished to enjoy himself
without any notice.

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,319
Isn't this inappropriate?

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,599
Yes.

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,400
Mother, your lecture is quite right.

56
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,560
I'll summon him right now.

57
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,479
The show is about to begin.

58
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,280
All of you should go and watch.

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,439
If you're late,

60
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,240
you're going to miss it.

61
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,719
What's going on?

62
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,240
Eh...

63
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
Together?

64
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,319
Where is he?

65
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
Stop crying.
Your tears are shattering my heart.

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,360
How can they suddenly let you go?

67
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,719
She reasoned that
since my parents are in Du County,

68
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,240
I would be the most suitable person
to manage the estate there.

69
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,719
I couldn't refuse.

70
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,560
She said
they are short-staffed over there

71
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,280
and asked me to leave tonight.

72
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,159
Once I leave,
I will never be able to come back.

73
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,280
Young master,

74
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,240
why don't you plead with madam for me?

75
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,879
I can't.

76
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,719
If I plead,

77
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,240
our relationship will...

78
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,800
You didn't think too much

79
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,080
when you slept with me earlier.

80
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,919
Now you are so cautious.

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,840
(No, not today.
There are many guests today.)

82
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,479
I care about you.

83
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,599
My sweetheart,
I can't bear to let you leave.

84
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,439
Are you telling the truth?

85
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,199
Who is it?

86
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,240
Who?

87
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,599
Xue Lingyi!

88
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,439
Are you trying to kill your own husband?

89
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,759
It wasn't me.

90
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,800
You dare say it wasn't you.

91
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,959
You venomous woman!

92
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,120
You heartless thing!

93
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,439
How dare you accuse me
while you're cheating on me here!

94
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,040
You cheater!

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,600
Young master!

96
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,720
Don't hurt the young master.

97
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,399
You wretch!

98
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,319
Stop it!

99
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,079
Your garden is really big.

100
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,040
It's still so far from the stage.

101
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Thank you.

102
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:38,800
My lady,

103
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,600
this way, please.

104
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,680
We should be almost there.

105
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,079
What is that noise?

106
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,399
Looks like
someone's fighting over there.

107
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,839
Someone's fighting.

108
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,480
Isn't she the madam
of the Rongs' fourth branch?

109
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,439
It can't be.
She's usually very well-behaved.

110
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,920
This is bad.

111
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,279
Our family's reputation is so disgraced.

112
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,279
I'll beat you to death.

113
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,879
What should we do?

114
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,279
What should we do?

115
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,560
Stop it!

116
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,959
Xue Lingyi,

117
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,480
what are you doing?

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,240
Do you think
we are not disgraced enough?

119
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,839
Is Cui

120
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,199
settled?

121
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,959
As you said,

122
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,160
I gave her freedom

123
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,519
and let her parents take her away.

124
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,240
If she stayed in the Rong family,

125
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,040
Xue Lingyi
would definitely not spare her.

126
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,639
However,

127
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,759
even if Xue Lingyi
couldn't make things difficult for her,

128
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,160
with all the rumors going around,

129
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,920
how can she hold up her head?

130
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,680
What were you thinking?

131
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Why did you have to disgrace our family

132
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,000
in front of all the prominent families
in the capital?

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,079
I...

134
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,639
I was momentarily overwhelmed by anger.

135
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,600
Matriarch,

136
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,920
you know how I normally behave.

137
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,399
I will never do it again.

138
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,480
Yes, matriarch,

139
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,040
Lingyi is usually
so virtuous and well-behaved.

140
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,399
If Rong Xiu hadn't messed up,

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,800
how could she have been so angry?

142
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,759
She and Rong Xiu are very much in love.

143
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,120
Let alone concubines,

144
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,720
Rong Xiu doesn't even
have a maid in his room.

145
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,480
He's totally dedicated to Lingyi.

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,839
It's no wonder she can't handle it.

147
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,680
Rong Xiu dares not take a concubine

148
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,959
because your jealousy is too strong.

149
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,120
Which legitimate wife
from a prestigious family

150
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,759
would go crazy like you

151
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,040
upon seeing her husband
with another woman?

152
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,920
Matriarch,

153
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
you have really wronged Lingyi.

154
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,920
She's able to accept other women.

155
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,759
I heard that

156
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,399
Yu's birth mother
is Rong Xiu's mistress.

157
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,920
Where is that woman?

158
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,240
Right.

159
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,000
She is Yu's birth mother.

160
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why did you accept her alone?

161
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,399
Right.

162
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,839
You

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,199
should let that woman
come to the Rong family

164
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,560
and let her be Rong Xiu's concubine.

165
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,079
By doing that, you can not only
win Rong Xiu's heart,

166
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,759
but also stop the nobles in the capital

167
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,120
from ridiculing Rong Xiu
for being henpecked

168
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,560
and daring not to take a concubine

169
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,279
for having a feisty wife at home.

170
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,120
She...

171
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,959
What's wrong with her?

172
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,000
She

173
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,079
died.
