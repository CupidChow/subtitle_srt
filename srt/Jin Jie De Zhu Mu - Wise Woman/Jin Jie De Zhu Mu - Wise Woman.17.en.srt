1
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:11,264
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:15,880
What is he doing?

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,600
General,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,120
what is this all about?

5
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:29,160
I will take my mother away from here.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,719
She'd feel disgusted with staying

7
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,640
at such a place.

8
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,200
Your father treated your mother poorly,

9
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,960
which led her to die in sorrow.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,240
But your father has passed away.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,320
The past cannot be changed.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Why do you cling to it?

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,880
=Episode 17=
Let's just

14
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,520
enjoy our reunion.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,920
Look, we all missed you.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,719
Did you forget

17
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,200
I no longer took the Rong surname?

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,239
I took my mother's surname Zhao.

19
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,480
I'm Zhao Yan.

20
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,840
Just a hunter in the mountains.

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,560
When I left the Rong Family

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,760
and was removed
from the family genealogy,

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,200
you all

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,079
heartily agreed.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,799
What...

26
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,400
Stop!

27
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,560
She's legally married into our family.

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,719
You can leave this mansion,

29
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,799
but she can't.

30
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,120
I want to stay.

31
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,319
Looks like she's not willing
to give up our family's wealth

32
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,639
and honor as a madam.

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,560
You're right.

34
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,280
I am Mrs. Rong.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,319
I have my duty.

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,240
I should stay.

37
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,840
General, don't feel troubled.

38
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,599
If you want to go...

39
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,639
Alright.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,560
I'll stay too.

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,360
These people all
harbor malicious intentions

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,319
and covet my title.

43
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,879
As long as I'm here,

44
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,879
I will protect you.

45
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,560
This can't be it.

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
I spent so much effort.

47
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,719
Go fetch the game
I specifically prepared

48
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,680
for the general.

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,159
Yes.

50
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,599
What are you doing?

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,240
Help me.

52
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,159
The adoption issue can't end like this.

53
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,960
The general has returned.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,159
The adoption naturally no longer counts.

55
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,879
I don't care.

56
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,479
You think

57
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,199
you can just be marquise
after his return?

58
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,120
Don't forget

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,319
we have a child.

60
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,759
If the general knew about this,

61
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,960
would you think you could survive?

62
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,479
Please reconsider

63
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,039
what I just said.

64
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,280
What were you two
talking about just now?

65
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,840
Nothing.

66
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,319
He just wanted to use me
to curry favor with you.

67
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,000
Wan'er,

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,759
we've reunited after so much hardship.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,520
What are you hiding from me?

70
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,240
Do you trust me?

71
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,680
Since you're not going to tell me,

72
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
I won't ask.

73
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:29,800
General,

74
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,279
I've investigated about the Gong Family.

75
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,040
Miss Gong jumped into the lake.
Madam took her place in the marriage.

76
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,199
However, during the investigation,

77
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,199
I discovered an unexpected thing.

78
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,360
Where is she now?

79
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,519
She's already settled

80
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,959
in a safe place.

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,879
Alright, let's go see her now.

82
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,560
Yes.

83
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:58,772
(Gong Wan'er)

84
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,279
You are Gong Wan'er?

85
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,360
We've verified it.

86
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,879
She appeared in Anping Village

87
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,360
after Gong Wan'er jumped into the river.

88
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,920
She bought a house,

89
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,839
and rarely went out.

90
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,199
The villagers know nothing
about her background.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,399
You faked your death
to escape the marriage.

92
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,920
Do you know this is a grave crime?

93
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,360
You've got the wrong person.

94
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,199
I'm not Gong Wan'er.

95
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,240
Once you step out of this room

96
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,839
and meet the officials,

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,199
you won't live
in such a comfortable room anymore.

98
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,600
You'll be put in jail.

99
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,399
You...

100
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,639
Who exactly are you?

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,040
It is none of your business.

102
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,120
All you need to know is

103
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,600
that your family found a woman to marry
into the Rong Family instead of you.

104
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,279
You just need to stay here

105
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,959
and don't let anyone
discover your identity.

106
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,800
Then your parents,

107
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,000
the woman who married
in your place and you

108
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,319
will all be safe and sound.

109
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,160
Otherwise,

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,480
your mistake

111
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,519
will implicate your whole family.

112
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,839
I understand.

113
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,560
You want me to be put
under house arrest by you

114
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,800
without even telling me who you are.

115
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:50,560
(Rong's Mansion)

116
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,800
Rong Yan now

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,560
is a general with great power.

118
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,759
Many people

119
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,800
are trying to find his mistakes.

120
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,959
You must be very careful
about the matter of the child.

121
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,800
One false move

122
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,519
will result in the consequences
that are unimaginable.

123
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:07,759
I know, so I didn't tell it to him.

124
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,360
You alone can't prove yourself.

125
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,839
The most important thing now is

126
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,160
to find solid evidence

127
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,040
to prove

128
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,160
the child's father

129
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,360
is the general, not Rong Xiu.

130
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,040
I once woke up from a coma

131
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,439
in Xue's mansion.

132
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,040
Xue Lingyi asked a doctor for me.

133
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,879
I guess that was the time

134
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,120
when she knew I was pregnant.

135
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,319
My lady, it's okay.

136
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,439
It will be resolved.

137
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,920
What's wrong?

138
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,399
Nothing. Maybe I saw it wrong.

139
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,160
Gong Wan'er,

140
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,879
do you know

141
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,920
the consequences of sneaking out?

142
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,040
Don't you care about
the safety of your parents?

143
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,399
Are you so angry

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,399
because you're worried about
the safety of my parents

145
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,680
or Xue Wan'er who replaced me?

146
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,240
If I hadn't sneaked out,

147
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,639
I wouldn't have even known

148
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,360
that I should be

149
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,279
your wife.

150
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,720
General.

151
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,759
Please behave yourself.

152
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:46,360
You're really devoted to Xue Wan'er.

153
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,799
But she's using my identity.

154
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,240
General,

155
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,159
you can't live a lie your whole life.

156
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,919
The better life looks in a lie,

157
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,240
the worse it will get

158
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,960
the moment it's debunked.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,399
Then you try it.

160
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,879
Let's see who can debunk

161
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,000
the lie I want to defend.

162
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,600
(Marrying a dead man
could only give me a title.)

163
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,480
(Since you've come back alive,)

164
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,240
