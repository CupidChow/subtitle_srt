00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:11,314
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,839
There are six branches of our family.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,880
The eldest,

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,399
third and fourth branches
live in this mansion.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,679
The rest live apart.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,160
Today I asked them to come back

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,320
so that I can introduce you to them.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,719
I'm so honored.

9
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,079
Although I am the general's wife,

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,920
I am new here

11
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,240
and clueless about the rules.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,759
It is a rare gathering of us all.

13
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,159
I have something

14
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,640
that I want to discuss with everyone.

15
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,240
Yesterday you said
I should adopt a man for the general

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,479
to inherit the title.

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,920
I have already thought it through.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,960
What adoption?

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,759
=Episode 5=
Why don't we know about this?

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,240
Seems like living
outside the house is being an outsider.

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,280
Such a thing
was actually hidden from us.

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,399
Such a good chance will only fall

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
into the hands
of your own grandson Rong Heng,

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,000
right?

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,480
How can you do it?

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,840
Not telling us at all.

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,519
No wonder you got him
a new wife so soon.

28
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,640
Matriarch,

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,239
after all, it's the inheritance
of the title of Marquis.

30
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,319
There should

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,079
be an equal opportunity
for every branch.

32
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,640
That's right.

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,439
Why can't it be us?

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,760
You made a deal with her?

35
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,280
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,640
You don't discuss everything
with me either, right?

37
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:28,920
Of course,
there are equal opportunities.

38
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,519
But you are new here.

39
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,319
Just because I am new here

40
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,640
and I don't know everybody well.

41
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,959
Unlike you.
The eldest branch is your own son.

42
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,159
The third branch seems to be

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,359
the grandson of the patriarch.

44
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,040
If they are directly chosen,

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,799
it will inevitably lead to gossip,

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,640
saying that you two are biased
and covet the title.

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,920
It will damage your reputation.

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,200
It's better to let me

49
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,519
who knows nobody here
decide this matter,

50
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,480
so as to show your impartiality.

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,640
Don't you think so?

52
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,280
It's a good idea

53
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,000
to let Aunt decide it,
as it will give you a chance.

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Otherwise, the eldest branch

55
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,080
might have this title.

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,759
You are our grandfather.

57
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,560
You should consider us.

58
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:23,393
(Rong Family's Patriarch)

59
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,520
The new bride makes sense.

60
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,159
She just entered the house.

61
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,599
Only she can be fair and unprejudiced

62
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,599
and make everyone agree
without any objection.

63
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,520
Let her decide on this matter then.

64
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,360
Good.

65
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,800
Let the marquise decide this matter.

66
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,879
Let's settle for this.

67
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,039
Good boy. Call me Mother.

68
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:58,960
Yu.

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,759
Yu.

70
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,240
Wan'er.

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,919
I didn't know you met Rong Xiu privately

72
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,879
and discussed so many things.

73
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,759
Lingyi.

74
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,039
I shouldn't have done that.

75
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,639
That matter is all to our advantage.

76
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,919
Mind your tongue

77
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,400
and don't go too far.

78
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,840
What if she goes back on her word

79
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,080
after taking away the baby?

80
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,800
I have my own plans.

81
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,759
Wan'er,

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,439
I have promised

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,240
to send the child to Gong's mansion

84
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,159
as Father,

85
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,120
but

86
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,000
after all, this matter of adoption

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,159
has not been settled yet.

88
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,080
I can't bring it up

89
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,360
with Matriarch.

90
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,879
I know.

91
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,120
Lingyi doesn't trust me.

92
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,680
I am so stupid.

93
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,960
I can't handle it on my own.

94
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,039
But, Lingyi,

95
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,800
you are good at plotting.

96
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,400
I know

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,000
you must have a way
to facilitate the adoption.

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,159
Please don't let me stand
in my brother-in-law's way

99
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,000
because of this.

100
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,879
She is right.

101
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,919
You're good at plotting

102
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,240
and calculating.

103
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,800
Wan'er is simple-hearted

104
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,840
and knows nothing about it.

105
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,439
So you take charge of this.

106
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,279
I'll do

107
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,759
what you tell me, Lingyi.

108
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,319
These days,

109
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,560
I've been worried

110
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,360
about choosing the general's successor.

111
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,160
I am afraid of offending one

112
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,600
after choosing the other.

113
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,680
Come on.

114
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,759
We are all family.

115
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,319
Could we really fall out for a title?

116
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,240
Actually,
the patriarch privately told me

117
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,079
you are the most virtuous.

118
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,639
The matriarch told me

119
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,079
you are the most educated and rational.

120
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,839
I'm flattered.

121
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,160
I understand.

122
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,480
The elders asked me to decide,

123
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,040
but how can I do it
without the support of the patriarch?

124
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,160
Yeah.

125
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,759
How can I do it
without the support of the matriarch?

126
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,120
Exactly.

127
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,399
In the coming days,

128
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,839
the royal reward will arrive.

129
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,600
Would you mind helping me

130
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,959
deal with the general's belongings

131
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,040
and everything else?

132
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,013
(Rong's Mansion)

133
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:22,688
(Sincerity)

134
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,759
What...

135
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,360
What should I do?

136
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,319
What's the matter?

137
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,279
A batch of gifts just came yesterday,

138
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,120
and another batch was sent here today.

139
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,480
The items are valuable this time.

140
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,600
They insisted the marquise

141
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,639
or the general's offspring
must personally receive them.

142
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,720
But my lady has been so busy
these past few days.

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
She's got a headache
and just went to bed.

144
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
W-Who can I ask for help
to receive the gifts?

145
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,720
I'll do it.

146
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,360
I'll do it.

147
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,720
What gives you the right?

148
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,360
Mrs. Rong,

149
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,680
you should learn

150
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,600
some managing skills.

151
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,639
I can't.

152
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,759
With my nephew's wife here,

153
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,360
how can it be my turn?

154
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,759
Matriarch,

155
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
something happened!

156
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,240
The ladies of the eldest
and third branches are fighting

157
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,240
outside.

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,279
What?

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,600
You used to act subservient
in front of me

160
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,560
and got many benefits from me.

161
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,279
Now you want to contend for the title?

162
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,560
You don't even know your status!

163
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,319
If it wasn't
for the matriarch's partiality,

164
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,480
could you bunch of fools

165
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,519
enjoy a good life in this mansion?

166
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,040
Now God sees

167
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,560
the real support of our family.

168
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,279
The title should be ours.

169
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,920
Stop it, all of you!

170
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,560
Matriarch,

171
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,480
it's them crossing the line.

172
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,319
Matriarch, the people
from the palace said

173
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,199
these things were meant
for the general's family.

174
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,480
What qualifies her to receive them?

175
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,199
Is she the general's offspring?

176
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,439
Is it you?

177
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,360
Matriarch,

178
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,160
didn't you have a deal with the aunt...

179
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,839
Shut up.

180
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,519
Neither of your branches
is the heir to the general.

181
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,879
Matriarch, what does it mean?

182
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,079
(For the sake of Yu,)

183
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,079
(I can only say sorry to you.)

184
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,079
(Rong's Mansion)

185
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,360
(The plaque of the ancestral hall)
It is a pity that your husband died

186
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,600
in battle at such a young age.

187
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,199
We forced you to marry a dead person,

188
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,040
so you hold grudges.

189
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,319
But if you think you can
stir up trouble under my watch,

190
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,879
it won't be that easy.

191
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,480
Why did you say that?

192
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,240
If you hadn't interfered,

193
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,199
how could the two ladies

194
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,680
act so disgracefully in public?

195
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,759
If the water can be muddied,

196
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,759
there must be silt beneath.

197
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,759
Once the heir of the general
has the title of Marquis,

198
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,120
he is the head of the family internally,

199
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,079
and externally, he represents
the reputation of the Rong Family.

200
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,439
Matriarch.

201
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,480
Are you really willing to hand over
the family you've worked so hard for

202
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,040
to the eldest branch?

203
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,480
You're playing these tricks

204
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,240
surely not for our family.

205
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,959
What are you plotting?

206
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,920
Now that I'm part of your family,

207
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,920
why can't you believe I mean well?

208
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,759
You've given me the title of Marquise,

209
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,160
so naturally,
I should choose a good successor

210
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,879
to ensure my wealth in the future.

211
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,960
I know

212
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,279
the eldest and the third branches
can't shoulder great responsibilities,

213
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,600
but as for Rong Xiu
of the fourth branch,

214
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,919
what capabilities does he have

215
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,080
beyond marrying a good wife?

216
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,000
In the long run, our future lies
with the future generations.

217
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,799
The current generation is incompetent,

218
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,080
but what about the next generation?

219
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,840
The next generation?

220
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,600
His new son,

221
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
