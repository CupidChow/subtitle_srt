1
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:11,034
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,519
Look!

3
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,519
The bride from the Gong family

4
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,440
is giving away wealth and wellbeing.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,519
Miss Gong is so blessed

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,520
to be able to marry
the current upstart marquis general.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,719
She's not blessed.

8
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:34,719
She's cursed.

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,399
Look at this wedding hall.

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,520
You can't see the groom.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,920
I heard the general...

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,359
Don't gossip.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,759
This is a military secret.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,799
Gossip is punishable by death.

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,719
What a pity!

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,079
Lingyi,

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,560
there's such a big celebration
in the mansion today.

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,439
=Episode 3=
Why aren't you happy?

19
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,000
All these years, she has been
trying so hard to please Matriarch.

20
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,359
She even credited an illegitimate child
as her own

21
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,319
simply because

22
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,560
she wanted to be
the matriarch of the Rong Family.

23
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:12,719
But now, the new bride is the marquise

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,959
with such a noble status.

25
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,280
I'm afraid your dream

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,439
seems about to fail.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,519
Don't bother.

28
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,280
Look,

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,239
your husband
is much more savvy than you.

30
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:25,239
He knows how to curry favor
with the marquise.

31
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,640
Didn't I ask you
to go to the shop today?

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,439
What do you know?

33
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,760
Leaving a good impression
on the marquise is the most important.

34
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:38,799
Greetings, aunt.

35
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,439
I'm your nephew, Rong Xiu.

36
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,239
Good.

37
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,159
Here's your reward.

38
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:02,832
(One month ago)

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,479
Wan'er?

40
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,560
Wan'er?

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,000
My Wan'er.

42
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:24,039
(Madam Gong)

43
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,240
My child.

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,199
You're awake. Come.

45
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,439
You're finally awake,

46
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,360
Wan'er.

47
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,319
My Wan'er.

48
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,800
It's good that you're awake.

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,520
I'm so glad.

50
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,360
Let me have a look.

51
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:50,120
My child, you're still as beautiful.

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,319
Master, Madam,

53
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,400
it's time to eat.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,319
Why isn't there
our Wan'er's favorite shrimp?

55
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,360
Wan'er,

56
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm going to cook for you.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,639
Just wait.
The shrimp I cook are so good.

58
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,560
My shrimp are unbelievably tasty.

59
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,439
Just wait.

60
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,639
You are?

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,280
I had a daughter who was about your age.

62
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,439
Her name is Gong Wan'er.

63
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,599
She is also called Wan'er.

64
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,400
So

65
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,080
young lady, you...

66
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,759
Xue is my family name.

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,199
My given name is Wan'er.

68
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:36,879
(Master Gong)

69
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,840
What a coincidence!

70
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,159
This is fate.

71
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,960
What happened to your daughter?

72
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,560
She was forced into marriage
by a nobleman

73
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,719
and jumped into a lake to kill herself.

74
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,560
Her mother fell seriously ill
because of this.

75
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,319
We went to the lake
to look for her body.

76
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,360
We didn't expect

77
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,280
to rescue you.

78
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,719
Master!

79
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,319
What happened?

80
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:05,759
The Rong...

81
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,199
They're sending people again.

82
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,599
One after another.

83
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,199
They just won't stop.

84
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,120
Young lady,

85
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,280
rest first.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,600
Let's go.

87
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,720
Quite a crowd.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,720
Master Gong,

89
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,560
think about it clearly.

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,160
My young brother-in-law, Rong Yan,
has just been conferred as a marquis.

91
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,439
With your Gong Family's status,

92
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,160
are you really
breaking off the betrothal?

93
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,279
I'm breaking it off?

94
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,079
You deceived us into marriage.

95
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,160
Based on the secret news from the army,

96
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,959
the general is seriously wounded.

97
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,959
Maybe he's already...

98
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,120
Although the front lines
are tightly controlled,

99
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,360
your family must know

100
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,800
about this matter.

101
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,040
Again and again,

102
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,920
you want my daughter
to marry a dead man.

103
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,560
What are your intentions?

104
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:09,959
Old man,

105
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,759
don't choose the hard way.

106
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,360
Under His Majesty's regime,

107
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,879
are you thinking of bullying with power?

108
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,600
Stop pretending here

109
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,120
to gain sympathy from us.

110
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,839
You know very well.

111
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,920
Once your daughter
is married into the Rong Family

112
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,199
and becomes an unparalleled marquise,

113
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,079
your family will gain much benefit.

114
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,639
Let me put it more bluntly.

115
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,480
If the general had not died,

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
this marriage would never fall on
an impoverished family like yours.

117
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,560
What did you say? You...

118
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,759
Old man.

119
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,480
I may not understand His Majesty
like you do.

120
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,720
But I dare say

121
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,600
His Majesty

122
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,120
is also hoping
that you marry your daughter soon

123
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,160
so as to dispel doubts in the army

124
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,279
and stop spreading
news of the general's death

125
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,279
to soothe the public.

126
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,759
On the contrary,

127
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,759
if you use an excuse
to delay the marriage,

128
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,959
making the rumors increasingly real,

129
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,759
that would be a huge disaster
that destabilizes the war situation.

130
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,480
What would His Majesty think then?

131
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,560
The emperor's wrath

132
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,439
can annihilate an entire family.

133
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,439
The emperor's wrath?

134
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,720
You guys are determined
to bully with power, aren't you?

135
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,639
Alright.

136
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,959
How about taking away my life?

137
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,120
Father,

138
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,759
I'm willing

139
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,759
to marry into the Rong Family.

140
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,600
(This voice...)

141
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,319
(How does this voice sound so familiar?)

142
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,759
Quickly.

143
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,040
The young lady will go to Serene Hall.

144
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,079
We have so much stuff to pack.

145
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,199
(Serene Hall?)

146
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,800
(Du Juan)
Young lady,

147
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,759
she really came.

148
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,000
Tonight,

149
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,680
I'm going to meditate here.

150
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,639
Guard outside

151
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,560
and don't let anyone disturb.

152
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,759
Yes.

153
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,240
Father,

154
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:21,639
mother.

155
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,959
Master Gong saved me from the river.

156
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,279
To repay their kindness,

157
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,720
I will marry into the Rong Family

158
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,160
on behalf of their daughter.

159
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,959
You...

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,480
It's you.

161
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,439
You didn't die?

162
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,959
You deliberately lured me here?

163
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,839
This place is desolate.

164
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,879
And you are alone,

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,040
just like me in the river back then.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,720
I wanted to cry out,

167
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,720
but couldn't.

168
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,120
I wanted to escape,

169
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,839
but couldn't either.

170
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,240
Rong Xiu drowned me.

171
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,560
Heaven took pity.

172
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,839
The people of the Gong Family saved me.

173
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,680
Perhaps heaven also thought

174
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,240
the person who should die

175
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,199
shouldn't be me.

176
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,120
I didn't know

177
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
so much happened after that.

178
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,720
You said

179
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,320
you would marry into the Rong Family
on behalf of the Gong Family.

180
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,440
You lured me over here

181
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,360
because you wanted me
to hide your identity, didn't you?

182
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,799
Yes.

183
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,799
Master Gong
is in such a difficult situation.

184
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,960
I'm doing this to repay them.

185
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,320
You're not doing this out of gratitude.

186
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,919
You're doing this for your child.

187
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,200
Marrying under a false identity
is a serious crime.

188
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,639
If it is discovered,

189
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,799
the Gong Family
will face a great calamity.

190
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,120
Sister,

191
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,039
deception in marriage is a major sin.

192
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:25,960
Then,

193
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,159
what about the deception in child?

194
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,360
What do you mean?

195
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,519
The Rong Family took away my child.

196
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,440
That's my child with my husband.

197
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,039
Sister,

198
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,840
it's my gratitude
that stopped me from exposing this.

199
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,960
I can let Master Gong
go to the Rong Family

200
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,840
to help me reclaim my child

201
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,360
and give me justice.

202
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,559
But then,

203
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,399
Rong Xiu, Matriarch Rong

204
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,159
and all the people in the Rong family

205
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,600
will know how you deceived them.

206
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,759
By then,

207
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,320
you will be the one

208
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,159
in big trouble.

209
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,720
You dare not risk
the Gong Family and your child.

210
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,960
Indeed.

211
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,919
A situation
where both parties suffer losses

212
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,840
is not what I want to see.

213
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,320
Sister,

214
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,200
I want to ask you for help.

215
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,000
All I want is my child.

216
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
As long as I can
marry into the Rong Family

217
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,759
and see my child every day,

218
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,919
we can bury

219
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,519
all the secrets in our hearts,

220
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
shall we?
