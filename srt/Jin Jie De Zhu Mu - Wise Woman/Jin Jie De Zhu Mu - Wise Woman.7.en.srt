00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:11,375
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,279
I heard that the marquise recently
got a pair of blood jade bracelets.

3
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:15,759
Exactly.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,600
It's the pair that the matriarch
promised to give you before.

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,640
Don't be angry.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,039
After all, she is the marquise.

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,719
Letting her have it

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,160
is not a big deal.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,199
Madam,

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,079
congratulations.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,760
Congratulations for what?

12
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,560
A new batch of fox fur coats arrived.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,960
They're rare.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,520
What does it have to do with me?

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,240
Everyone knows
you're afraid of the cold.

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,520
The matriarch
gives you the fox fur coat every year.

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,119
Perhaps this year,
it's going to the marquise.

18
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,280
No matter what, she is an outsider.

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,320
You and the matriarch
are from the same family.

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,079
She will always think of you.

21
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,240
My lady is taking inventory.

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,119
How about coming with me to take a look?

23
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,480
All the jewelry
should be sorted out clearly.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,439
=Episode 7=
Put the clothes in the ladies' rooms.

25
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,680
Handle the boxes gently.

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,200
Heard that?

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,760
Yes.

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,560
My lady,

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,400
the two ladies are here.

30
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:22,096
(Chun Yu)

31
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,760
You both are here.

32
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,359
Sorting these things
really makes me busy.

33
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,040
As the matriarch says,

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,359
the capable do more work, right?

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,959
I've listed everything.

36
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,040
Send your people here

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,200
to take these things away later.

38
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,120
A batch of quality porcelain
has arrived.

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,120
I absolutely can't let
the clumsy servants

40
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,519
damage it.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,560
I can only admire
the beautiful fox fur coats every year.

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,840
This year, can I have a few of them?

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,280
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,439
If you like, just take them.

45
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,319
It's just these few boxes.
Take them away.

46
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,840
What are you doing?

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,639
Madam, this is for my lady.

48
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,439
We've already checked the list.

49
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,560
What do you mean?

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,599
You're throwing
your weight around again.

51
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:23,639
Madam, these are just
some ordinary things.

52
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,879
If you're interested in any of them,

53
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,280
just tell my lady.

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,680
She doesn't care about
such things usually.

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
She will give them to you.

56
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,960
Who is she?

57
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,520
Do I need her charity?

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,919
Move the things first.

59
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,520
Don't move them.

60
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,680
Don't.

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,439
Be careful.

62
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,360
You lackey!

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,159
What?

64
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,919
Do you servants

65
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,479
dare lay hands on me?

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,680
It's my fault.

67
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,000
Madam, please don't be angry.

68
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,039
You are acting high and mighty
as you are the general's servant?

69
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,319
I am the madam.

70
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,400
It is just right for me
to discipline the servants.

71
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,080
It's time to notify her lady.

72
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,400
What?

73
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:16,640
(Rong's Mansion)

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,599
Stop it.

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,400
Are you going to start a fight

76
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,360
with me for a servant?

77
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,680
What did she do wrong?

78
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,080
She was trying to grab my things.

79
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,199
This is the item list for today.

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,400
Even if she was right,

81
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,599
can't I punish

82
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,800
a servant who talked back to me?

83
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,439
She was arguing for herself.

84
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,000
What's wrong with that?

85
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,400
Forget it.

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,439
Maybe I misunderstood.

87
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,240
Forget it?

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,840
How could this matter
be dropped like this?

89
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,400
What are you going to do?

90
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,319
Don't worry.

91
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,840
I won't be unreasonable
and resort to violence

92
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,919
like someone.

93
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,280
Don't think you can do whatever you want
because you are marquise.

94
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Don't forget

95
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,039
she and the matriarch...

96
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,159
I will speak

97
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,560
to the matriarch personally.

98
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,480
My lady,

99
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,279
forget it.

100
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,759
This must be Xue Lingyi's trap.

101
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,319
If you make it big,

102
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,759
I'm afraid she has another card to play.

103
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,079
Today,

104
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,199
I must argue for justice.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,279
What does it mean?

106
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,399
She just slapped a maidservant.

107
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
If you think you lost face...

108
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,279
In your eyes, there's only the face.

109
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,399
Is there no justice for a maidservant?

110
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,120
Just a trivial matter.

111
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Why are you trying to make such a fuss?

112
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,839
You should learn from the generosity

113
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,120
of our sages.

114
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,120
Is the generosity only for the powerful

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,439
or only for the masters?

116
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,240
You are the matriarch
of the Rong Family.

117
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,079
I just want you to be just,

118
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,959
punish Mrs. Wu,

119
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,240
and let her apologize to Du Juan

120
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,040
What?

121
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,199
Apologizing to a maid?

122
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,319
Matriarch, this will be a great shame.

123
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,279
You're making a fuss over this issue.

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,879
What needs to be punished is not her,

125
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,360
but you!

126
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,560
So,

127
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,439
you won't listen to reason.

128
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,600
Fine.

129
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,439
I'll go to the patriarch for judgment.

130
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
How dare you!

131
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,279
You really think
with the title of marquise,

132
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:52,360
you can run rampant in this family?

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,800
Someone!

134
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,959
Lock her up for me.

135
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,959
You think I'm overbearing?

136
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,079
Then I'll be overbearing for once.

137
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,639
Come in.

138
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,879
This is a revolt!

139
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,800
Matriarch,

140
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,160
these are from Gong Family.

141
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,120
They're all hot-tempered warriors.

142
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,920
If you really want to lock me up,

143
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,360
they will try to stop it.

144
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,560
There will be no mercy in fighting.

145
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,959
I'm not sure what will happen then.

146
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,959
You dare!

147
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,279
I was given a first-rank honorable title
by the Royal Family.

148
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,040
Right.

149
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,720
But I am marquise.

150
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,439
If we really have conflicts,

151
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,240
I don't think ordinary officials
will take the case.

152
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,920
At that time,
I'm afraid it will reach the palace.

153
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,279
We'll let His Majesty adjudicate then.

154
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,199
You!

155
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,360
Matriarch,

156
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,319
you are the one who cares most
about the reputation of the Rong Family.

157
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,079
I just want you to be fair and just.

158
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,040
Matriarch, please spare me.

159
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,560
How could I possibly apologize
to those lowly people?

160
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,399
I'd rather die.

161
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,199
Is that all?

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,639
