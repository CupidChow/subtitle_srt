00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,156
=Wise Woman=

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,400
Greetings, matriarch.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,120
Your dress is exquisitely embroidered.

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,839
It's an auspicious dress

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
that the marquise
personally made for me.

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,359
General returns with honor,

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,399
and the marquise respects you.

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,440
The Rong family
will surely be more prosperous.

9
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,839
It will not let your half lifetime
of hard work go in vain.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,159
May your words come true.

11
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,280
Mr. Sun, long time no see.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,880
Yes.

13
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,439
This is a pine and crane picture
for the matriarch.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,719
Wish her good health and longevity.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,719
Thank you.

16
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,719
=Episode 21=
Why isn't the general here?

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,759
He has gone to the palace
to report on his duties.

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,039
There are many guests today.
We might not have time for you.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,719
When time comes, my husband and I
will pay a visit to express our thanks.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,119
Then

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,000
we'll have a good talk.

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,719
Yes, of course.

23
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,400
Find some nimble ones

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,239
to put all the longevity gifts
in the storeroom.

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,799
Be careful.

26
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,000
Don't let them get damaged.

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,120
This person looks familiar.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,840
Where should I put this?

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,640
Put it there.

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,280
Okay.

31
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,760
You've been looking well recently.

32
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,799
Yes.

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,359
Madam.

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,239
Madam.

35
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,120
Excuse me for a moment.

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,799
Okay.

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,280
What's the matter?

38
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,799
Madam,

39
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,400
the child is missing.

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,959
What? How can he just disappear?

41
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,079
He was napping in the room.

42
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,480
But when we went in, he was gone.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Madam Gong told me to come
and report to you immediately.

44
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,439
I'll go and look for him.
You go back first.

45
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,599
Question all the people
who have been in the courtyard.

46
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,319
Yes.

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,400
Xue Wan'er!

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Let go of the child.

49
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Dear Marquise,

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,479
how could you be so careless?

51
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,599
Xue Lingyi,

52
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,879
let him go!

53
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,039
Have you forgotten?

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,439
I'm no longer a part of the Rong family.

55
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,919
I don't have to listen to you anymore.

56
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,280
What are you going to do?

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,439
Don't hurt the child.

58
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,120
Xue Lingyi, you've been divorced.

59
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,520
And you still dare to make a scene here.

60
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,719
Guards!

61
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,120
You shut up.

62
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,039
I used to respect you as the matriarch.

63
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,719
I was always patient with you.

64
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,879
But now, you're nothing more
than a mean old woman.

65
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,680
How dare you wag your finger at me!

66
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,240
I will only talk to Xue Wan'er.

67
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,520
If any of you dare to act rashly,

68
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,879
I'll harm this child.

69
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,960
I'm right here.

70
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,240
Come at me.

71
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,639
Don't hurt the child.

72
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,840
Stop right there.

73
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,479
Okay.

74
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:31,960
I won't move.

75
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,759
I won't move.

76
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,520
Xue Wan'er.

77
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,360
My dear aunt.

78
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,039
My dear sister.

79
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,879
I'll make sure you remember this day.

80
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,840
Why are you so nervous?

81
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,080
It seems this child

82
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,840
is really your life.

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,199
Xue Lingyi,

84
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,479
give me back the child, okay?

85
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,279
Today, in front of so many people,

86
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,199
if you admit your relationship
with this child,

87
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,720
I'll give him back to you.

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,360
Share this interesting story

89
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,800
with these nobles in the capital.

90
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,959
Tell them.

91
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,759
Spill those dirty and disgusting beans,

92
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,720
and I'll give the child back to you.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,399
What are you hesitating for?

94
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,680
Isn't the child important to you?

95
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,079
Tell them! Tell them now!

96
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,079
Okay, okay.

97
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,199
I will tell them.

98
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,079
(I can't agitate her. She's here today)

99
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,000
(to make me publicly admit
my scandal with Rong Xiu.)

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,920
I am

101
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,720
this child's...

102
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,279
What is it?

103
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,879
I am this child's

104
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,759
birth mother.

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,639
What?

106
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,680
How is this possible?

107
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,680
T-T-This...

108
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,120
This child is hers with Rong Xiu.

109
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,240
(Is she mad?)

110
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,240
The inner courtyard of the Rong family
could actually be so filthy.

111
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,560
(If I let her keep talking,)

112
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,079
(she will probably
bring me down with her.)

113
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,360
Xue Lingyi!

114
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:44,720
What are you doing?

115
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,399
Stop.

116
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,000
Xue Wan'er,

117
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,120
you've finally met your day.

118
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,560
Matriarch,

119
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,560
I've given so much for your Rong family,

120
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,560
toiling in earnest.

121
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,000
In the end,

122
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,959
you all discarded me like trash.

123
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,240
This massive Rong family

124
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,959
is so glamorous

125
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,720
and magnificent.

126
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,720
But once you peel its surface,

127
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,040
countless filthy scandals exist inside.

128
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,120
Lingyi,

129
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,560
stop being so obstinate.

130
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,160
Give the child to me.

131
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,720
Rong Xiu,

132
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,920
why do I end up with nothing

133
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,399
after everything I've done?

134
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,040
I'm left with nothing.

135
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,360
I know.

136
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,560
You did everything for me.

137
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,480
Then why did you abandon me?

138
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,120
They forced me.

139
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:27,240
You know, it's all on them.

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,240
I now understand that,

141
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,519
in this world,

142
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,839
only you truly care for me.

143
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,879
Have you finally understood?

144
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,680
What's going on?

145
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,639
What's going on?

146
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,399
I wish

147
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,680
