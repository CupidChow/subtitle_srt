[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,789
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,230
My entire family fortune is about to
be depleted.

4
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,100
Having hobbies is fine,

5
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,740
but you can't just make
exorbitant demands.

6
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,710
Your Majesty,

7
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,800
when you first came to me,

8
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,030
you said that the new dynasty
was not yet stable,

9
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,190
with wolves lurking around the court,

10
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,950
and that the past 2 years of implementing
new policies had been difficult.

11
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,920
So, you wanted my brother to be
your right-hand man

12
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,430
to assist you in building
a prosperous era.

13
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,270
So I've

14
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,950
contributed both money and effort,

15
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,950
and I've offered you my own brother.

16
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,530
You can't deceive me, a maiden, right?

17
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,710
You're so clever and quick-witted.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,400
I'm afraid you're more likely to be
the one deceiving others.

19
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,560
Who was it that said

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,940
your brother was disillusioned

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,710
with the former dynasty's turmoil—

22
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,320
and that you and I should work together,

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,270
put on an act to keep him by my side,

24
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,970
show him my utmost sincerity,

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,790
and gradually win him over

26
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,760
to help me?

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,800
That's right,

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,840
my idea wasn't wrong.

29
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,840
Who could have known that my brother
would be so difficult to handle?

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,580
But you still need him.

31
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,830
It's not that I need him.

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,270
It's the people who need him.

33
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,530
Your Majesty, please have some tea.

34
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,380
Stop being so polite.

35
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,130
You don't even have a cup here.

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,829
Rest assured, Ling'er.

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
We've grown up together since childhood.

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,040
I may fool others, but never you.

39
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,140
Whether this works out or not,

40
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,400
I promise you

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,290
that the Yue family will reclaim
its former glory.

42
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,400
I give you my word.

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,700
We didn't really grow up together.

44
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,400
My brother and I only studied

45
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,690
with you at private school for two years.

46
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,440
And besides,

47
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,560
I'm not doing this for the Yue family's
wealth and glory.

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,260
Please don't say that anymore.

49
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,910
You don't want wealth and glory?

50
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,110
Then what do you want?

51
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,310
Name it, and I'll grant you that as well.

52
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,630
I want my brother to be well.

53
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,850
Everyone says

54
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,950
he's a heaven-blessed prodigy

55
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,240
who became Prime Minister at only 20.

56
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,000
It's heaven's blessing

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,470
that came without effort.

58
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,730
But only I, as his sister, know

59
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,070
that the faster he rose,

60
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,240
the more dangerous

61
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
the court intrigues became.

62
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,260
The more military achievements he earned,

63
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,070
the more terrible scars covered his body.

64
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,470
I believe that someone like my brother

65
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,370
should be able to fulfill his ambitions

66
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,120
and have his name recorded in history.

67
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,160
I think the same as you.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,730
Being recorded in history isn't difficult.

69
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,590
What's difficult is how
your contemporaries will judge you

70
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,000
and how future generations
will evaluate you.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,860
I'm not just doing this for Yue Chi

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,150
but also for myself.

73
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,400
I know.

74
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,590
However,

75
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,800
I'm not responsible for that history part.

76
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,240
I'm only responsible for our family,

77
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,590
and these accounts don't look good at all.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,480
Here,

79
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,430
look at this, look.

80
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,910
Our Yue family's fortune

81
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,280
is about to be completely depleted.

82
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,240
Don't worry.

83
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,840
I may let the current prime minister
starve,

84
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,840
but I won't let you, my old friend,
starve.

85
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,100
However much you want,

86
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,680
I'll approve it.

87
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,800
You've been a real friend.

88
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,860
Of course.

89
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,110
But there's just one condition:

90
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,650
you must be very careful

91
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,860
not to let your brother find out.

92
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,750
Rest assured.

93
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,560
My brother

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,880
is busy as hell in your harem right now.

95
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,480
He has no time to deal with this.

96
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,400
Besides,

97
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,620
I'm the real expert in managing finances
for our Yue family.

98
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,850
My brother appreciates this skill of mine
the most.

99
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,870
I like it too.

100
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,700
What did you say?

101
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,480
I said I like that you're smart
and clever.

102
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,590
I'd be really lucky

103
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,550
if you were my sister.

104
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,120
Why did Ling'er send me all these

105
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,950
women's makeup and trinkets?

106
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,800
Are these what I need?

107
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,410
I need money!

108
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,020
Without money, how can I keep

109
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,350
getting good weapons for that blockhead?

110
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,970
Your Highness,

111
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,290
Consort Hui has sent an invitation

112
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,150
for you to attend a tea gathering.

113
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,950
Consort Hui inviting me to
a tea gathering?

114
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,780
She likely has ulterior motives.

115
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,690
But Consort Hui said

116
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,600
she has invited all the consorts
in the palace.

117
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
If Your Highness doesn't go,
it'll spoil the mood.

118
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,290
Your Highness,

119
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,310
shall we go then?

120
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,720
If I go and these consorts

121
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,770
see through my disguise, what should I do?

122
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,840
But if I don't go, I'll offend them,

123
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,490
and that will definitely bring trouble
for Ling'er in the future.

124
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,190
We go.

125
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,310
Oh my.

126
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,300
Yue, you've finally arrived.

[Elegant Dwelling with Spring Grace]

128
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,520
You've kept us sisters waiting.

129
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,560
Are they planning to make a fool of me?

130
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,290
You're late, so you must be punished.

131
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,840
If I don't settle the score today,

132
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,390
Ling'er will have a hard time

133
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,870
when she's here in the future.

134
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,720
That's fine.

[Elegant Dwelling with Spring Grace]

136
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
Qu, you decide.

137
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,720
Shall we settle this with words
or with fists?

138
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,830
Shall it be "spicy" or "plain"?

139
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,830
[Elegant Dwelling with Spring Grace]

140
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,850
W-W-What do you mean
by "spicy" or "plain"?

141
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,590
"Words" or "Fists"?

142
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,120
"Words" means with the tongue.

143
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,780
"Fists" means with the hands.

144
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,650
"Spicy" means bloodshed.

145
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,880
"Plain" means shedding tears.

146
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,720
You should all know

147
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,380
my usual preferences by now.

148
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,340
After all, I come from a military family.

149
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,000
So if I can settle things with my fists,

150
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,080
I won't waste time arguing.

151
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,510
Qu,

152
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:56,560
didn't we say we'd just have her
dance for our amusement?

153
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,390
She's playing for keeps here.

154
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,760
The harem has always valued harmony
above all.

155
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,500
As the leading figure of the harem,

156
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,130
the punishment should naturally be
"words" and "plain."

157
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,050
Naturally, naturally.

158
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,580
Yue,

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,650
come here.

160
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,340
Yes, Your Highness.

161
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,900
Since this is all a misunderstanding,

162
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,070
I'll do my best to entertain you.

163
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,460
Come on, come on!

164

Since it's just us sisters today,

166
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,490
I've specially brought some treasures.

167
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,190
Doesn't the pearl powder you usually use

168
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,470
make you look unnaturally pale?

169
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,240
Doesn't it?

170
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,620
Doesn't that give you a fake kind
of whiteness?

171
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,640
Yes, Your Highness!

172
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,900
Now, let's look at our pearl powder.

173
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,830
It definitely won't make you
unnaturally pale.

174
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,390
This is the latest Yuxuan pearl powder
from Fuchun Shop!

If we weren't close like sisters,

177
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,530
I wouldn't even bring it out normally.

178
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,920
Now, someone might ask,

179
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,090
"They're all pearl powders,

180
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,170
so why is our product so natural?"

181
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,990
Why is that?

182
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,720
-Yeah, why?
-Why?

183
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,940
Because our products use pink pearls.

00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,870
That's right.

186
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,270
Pink pearls are closer to
natural skin tones.

187
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,270
Pure white pearls are too stark.

188
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,270
It makes your face look deathly pale
and lifeless.

189
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,490
Look, look at this!

190
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,630
Isn't it?

191
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
How natural, right?

192
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,600
However, only 10 sets were sent
to the palace.

193
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,950
We only have 10 sets?

194
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,830
100 taels

195
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,600
per set.

196
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,070
-100 taels?
-100 taels?

197
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,150
That's too expensive.

198
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,430
You look down on me?

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,059
Today, I'll give you a special price.

200
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,190
20 taels!

201
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,270
-20 taels?
-20 taels?

202
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,630
-20 taels!
-We'd suffer a big loss!

203
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,440
-We'd go broke!
-Don't stop me!

204
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,080
Today is my birthday.

205
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
My sisters have come to celebrate with me.

206
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,320
What's wrong with squandering
some family fortune?

207
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,390
I'll take five sets!

208
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,270
I'll take five sets.

209
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,510
There are only 10 sets in total.

210
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,750
First come, first served.

211
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,840
We don't just have classic ones,

212
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,080
but also even exclusive palace editions.

213
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,510
Qu, this method is too sneaky!

214
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,830
I'm not buying.

215
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,650
I'm just going to take a look.

216
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,260
You...

217
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,930
Go ahead, try all you like!

218
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,560
There are some over here too!

219
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,470
Qu,

220
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,670
I'll go take a look too.

221
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm not going to buy anything. I won't.

222
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,360
You...

223
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,060
Try it on, try it on.

224
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,050
Try it.

225
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
Try it, and you buy it.

226
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,120
Buy this set and get a free veil.
A free face veil.

227
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,360
A free face veil?

228
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
This is for sale too.

229
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,440
-Everyone, take a look.
-Look around, feel free to browse.

230
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,200
A free veil!

231
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Open them up. There is more inside.

232
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,670
This one looks good.

233
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,280
This hairpin suits you perfectly.

234
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,120
Why was I not informed that Consort Hui

235
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,030
had invited Consort Yue to
the tea gathering?

236
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,630
Your Majesty was in council at the time,

237
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,510
so I...

238
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,030
The other consorts are quite hostile
toward Consort Yue.

239
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,290
There could be danger.

240
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,080
Next time,

241
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,510
prioritize your reports.

242
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,630
Then... are matters concerning
Consort Yue urgent?

243
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,120
150 taels.

244
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,440
Yue,

245
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,700
put away these two coral bracelets
properly.

246
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,490
When Xia Yunshuang receives her allowance
next month,

247
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,730
she'll buy them back.

248
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,850
Indeed.

249
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,480
We made a killing.

250
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,080
Those consorts sure have deep pockets.

251
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,000
You bet.

252
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,330
Then Huo Jingheng's pockets must be
even deeper.

253
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,350
Let's not overlook what's
right in front of us.

254
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,720
Let's go fleece him
for a big sum directly!

255
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,630
What does he usually like?

256
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,550
Why are you squinting like that?

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,440
You mean telescope?

258
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,790
Not bad, Yue.

259
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,440
You've learned new things.

260
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,080
Last month, foreign merchants

261
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,670
just brought in ten telescopes.

262
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,360
They say you can use them to see

263
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,750
all the way to the lotus flowers on top of

264
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,240
Great Guanyin Temple, miles away.

265
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,650
Is that so?

266
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,630
Then could you see the luminous pearl

267
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,830
at Taoniang's waist
in Zuixiang Restaurant?

268
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,240
Of course.

269
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,150
Zuixiang Restaurant is...

270
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,560
is not a mile away from here.

271
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,950
How much do you plan

272
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,600
to sell one telescope to me for?

273
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,860
Your Majesty, what are you saying?

274
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,080
I certainly won't sell the telescope
to you.

275
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,150
I'm worried that once you see so far,

276
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,120
you'll forget about me here
right in front of you.

277
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,290
You're better with words

278
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,160
than you are at making money.

279
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,080
Thank you for Your Majesty's praise.

280
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,880
You think that was a compliment?

281
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,790
You know full well the other consorts
dislike you.

282
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,520
Why do you still deal with them?

283
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,040
Because I want to become Empress!

284
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,250
Of course, I need to deal with them.

285
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,120
I've learned from Your Majesty's lesson.

286
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,040
I know I'm wrong now.

287
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,240
How many more accounts are left unsettled?

288
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,470
There are still many.

289
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,180
Help me out a bit, will you?

290
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,250
Why do His Majesty and Consort Yue

291
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,720
get along like buddies?

292
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,280
Ling'er.

293
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,970
I'll send you all the money I've earned.

294
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,760
Don't spend it all.

295
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,000
Give half of it to Dugu Xing

296
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,660
and tell him to immediately purchase

297
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,990
various high-quality weapons
not available on the market.

298
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,290
By the Empress Dowager's decree:

299
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,080
[Decree]

300
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,540
Rather than sitting idle,

301
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,330
it's better to strengthen your bodies
and minds!

302
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,450
When women are strong,
the nation is strong!

303
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,500
You shall all set an example

304
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,080
to establish a new trend

305
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
and empower the backbones

306
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,670
for our women in Ning!

307
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,030
From today forth,

308
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,100
morning and evening greetings

309
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,070
shall be replaced with physical training.

310
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,720
Is this still the imperial harem?

311
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,820
Why does it feel like a military camp now?

312
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,880
Don't say any more.

313
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,740
Don't piss off the Empress Dowager.

314
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,080
If she gets angry,

315
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,600
the entire harem will suffer.

316
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,950
I can't deal with Yue Ling'er,

317
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,640
but the Empress Dowager can.

318
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
If she offends the Empress Dowager,

319
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,610
she'll be in trouble.

320
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,480
But speaking of which,

321
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,330
where has Consort Yue gone?

322
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,190
Consort Yue...

323
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,370
Yue?

324
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,100
What are you looking for?

325
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,840
I don't know how it happened,
but I seem to have lost

326
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,500
the ruyi scepter that His Majesty
gifted Your Highness.

327
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,360
It was there when we came back.

328
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,840
If they ask about it during the inventory,

329
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,960
will they punish me?

330
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't panic.

331
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,630
This area isn't that big.

332
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,870
We'll definitely find it.

333
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,550
Well,

334
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
you search this area,

335
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,000
and I'll go check over there for you.

336
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,480
Okay, Your Highness.

337
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,990
Ruyi scepter...

338
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,970
Forbidden area?

339
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,820
[Forbidden Area]

340
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,990
You've got some real skills.

341
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:06,740
Who's there?

342
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,240
Little one,

343
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,350
has anyone ever told you

344
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,720
that those who trespass here
will face serious consequences?

345
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,630
I am but an insignificant nobody

346
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,500
who has wandered here while playing.

347
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,360
I apologize for the disturbance.

348
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,620
I'll leave right away.

349
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,440
I'm not bragging, but

350
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,360
this forbidden area is full of traps.

351
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,210
There, just one more step forward,

352
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,200
and you'll meet your maker.

353
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,140
Looks like we can't settle this
with a nice chat.

354
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,630
Are you a man or a woman?

355
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,170
You don't look like a vicious criminal.

356
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,650
You'll let me go?

357
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,430
I can let you go,

358
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,100
but first...

359
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,410
can you help me...

360
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,030
Right,

361
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,090
can you turn that candlestick for me?

362
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,090
Since you know the layout
of the traps here,

363
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,840
how come you're still...

364
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,550
If you hadn't come in and accidentally
triggered that mechanism,

365
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,570
would I be trapped like this?

366
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,740
You've trapped yourself.

367
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,890
Are you going to help me or not?

368
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,360
It's just a simple yes or no.

369
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,420
Straightforward.

370
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,870
Such formidable inner strength
in that palm strike.

371
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,580
You're...

372
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,980
the "Ghostbane" Du Sanniang.

373
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,000
[Du Sanniang, Empress Dowager of Ning]

374
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,930
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager?

375
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,220
I truly stumbled in here by mistake.

376
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,080
Even if I had the courage of a lion,

377
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,870
I wouldn't dare disturb
Your Majesty's seclusion.

378
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,170
You were so direct just now,

379
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,120
but now you're all delicate.

380
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,630
How boring.

381
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,390
The paths around this forbidden area
are so twisted,

382
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,320
and you just happened to wander in?

383
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,450
Not bad, little one.

384
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,520
You can take two of my palm strikes.

385
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,570
Since Your Majesty thinks highly of me,

386
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,000
why don't you try taking one of
my palm strikes?

387
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,110
Interesting.

388
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,720
Come on!

389
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,160
I'll take my leave.

390
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,210
You're quite good at this trick
of misdirection.

391
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,720
But running away like this,

392
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,430
do you still care about your dignity?

393
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,750
What's "dignity"?

394
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,310
If you can't eat it,

395
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,320
it's not worth caring about.

396
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,890
You...

397
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,150
Your Highness, Your Highness,

398
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,550
I've found the ruyi scepter.

399
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,810
It had fallen into the flowerbed.

400
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,510
Your Highness, where did you go just now?

401
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,510
I ventured into the forbidden area.

402
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:05,970
Your Highness,

403
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,220
are you alright?

404
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,030
I've heard

405
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,480
that the Empress Dowager used to
have a nickname

406
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,440
in the martial arts world
called the "Ghostbane."

407
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,400
Many concubines in the palace before

408
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,670
who wanted to please the Empress Dowager

409
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,920
secretly trespassed into
the forbidden area.

410
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,290
They either crawled out
or were sent flying.

411
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,150
Your Highness,

412
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,970
how come you neither crawled
nor were sent flying?

413
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,790
Who did you interact with before losing
the ruyi scepter?

414
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,550
I think it was a maid from Yanning Palace.

415
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,640
She told me that there was
a rare flower there

416
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,970
and asked me to go see it.

417
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,240
From now on, have less contact with people
from Yanning Palace.

418
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,390
Why?

419
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,760
Your Highness, wait for me.

420
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,160
A woman's shoe,

421
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,830
and it's palace-made.

422
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,780
Your Highness.

423
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,920
Why are you missing a shoe?

424
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,920
Oh no,

425
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,960
the shoe.

426
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,720
What's going on here?

427
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
So many servants.

428
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,310
I wonder what's gotten into
the Empress Dowager today.

429
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,320
I heard

430
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,330
that a consort intruded into
the forbidden area

431
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,930
and even had a fight with her.

432
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,620
That person left behind a shoe,

433
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,750
and now the Empress Dowager is having
everyone try it on.

434
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,800
Such a big shoe.

435
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Which consort in the whole palace
has feet that large?

436
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,820
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

437
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,540
Sister,

438
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,080
didn't you say the shoe was unusually big,

439
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,070
unlike what ordinary women would wear?

440
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,510
I've been thinking carefully,

441
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,480
and I find that it makes a lot of sense.

442
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,680
Which consort in the harem has
a large build and big feet?

443
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,640
I remember now.

444
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,310
Consort Yue has feet the size of a man's.

445
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
Yingwan, you tell us.

446
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,360
Right.

447
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,590
Apart from Consort Yue,

448
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,990
there's no other person.

449
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,110
Consort Yue...

450
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:58,970
Let's go.

451
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,450
The Empress Dowager has arrived!

452
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,310
Greetings, Your Majesty.

453
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,880
So, you are Consort Yue?

454
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,270
Yes, I am.

455
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,550
A villain trespassed into
the forbidden area

456
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,180
and disrupted Her Majesty's seclusion,

457
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,830
leaving behind this shoe.

458
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,460
All the consorts must try on

459
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,830
the shoe to prove their innocence.

460
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,590
Yue, would you come forward and try it on?

461
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,790
Since the entire palace is supposed to
try on the shoe,

462
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,940
how did it come so quickly

463
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,720
to my remote Fengluan Palace?

464
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,720
-Sister, have you tried...
-The style of this shoe

465
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,550
is clearly that of a consort's
embroidered shoes,

466
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,270
yet the size is so large.

467
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,830
Among all the consorts in the palace,

468
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,380
who else but you would
wear shoes this size?

469
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:42,990
Right!

470
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,790
That shoe looks about your size.

471
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,030
I don't understand what you mean by that.

472
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,310
What if someone is impersonating me?

473
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,880
There are countless guards and eunuchs
in the entire palace.

474
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,510
I imagine there are quite a few

475
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,970
who can fit into this shoe.

476
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,120
Earlier, Her Majesty was ambushed
by a villain in the forbidden area.

477
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,920
That person knows martial arts.

478
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,980
I've heard that you come from
a military family.

479
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,050
I suppose in this entire harem,

480
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,140
only you know martial arts.

481
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,760
Who says I know martial arts?

482
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,730
I'm just a delicate woman.

483
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,270
Whether you do or not,

484
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,210
we'll know with a test.

485
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,310
Your Majesty,

486
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,090
is it just because I was born
with big feet

487
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,640
and a tall, strong physique,

488
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,420
coming from a family of military generals,

489
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,880
that I should suffer unjust accusations
for no reason?

490
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,200
Your Majesty...

491
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,920
Enough!

492
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,200
So noisy!

493
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,600
You speak, then you speak,

494
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,890
and you speak several times!

495
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,830
Are you going to let me speak or not?

496
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,670
Whether it's true or not is not something
that needs arguing.

497
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,780
All martial artists practice
internal energy cultivation techniques.

498
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,070
One test will reveal all.

499
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,310
Your Majesty.

500
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,440
Your Majesty.

501
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,280
Your Majesty.

502
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Your Majesty.

503
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,270
Even if it's Mother,

504
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,600
you can't harm my beloved consort, right?

505
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,310
And you,

506
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,400
something this serious happened,

507
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,740
why didn't you tell me?

508
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,500
What happened to my son?

509
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,320
Your Majesty,

510
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,300
during your days of seclusion,

511
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,070
Consort Yue was summoned daily
by His Majesty.

512
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,050
His Majesty treasures her

513
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,400
and favors her greatly!

514
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,960
That's incredibly rare.

515
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,240
I used to think all of the women
in the harem

516
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,350
were too delicate to match my son.

517
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,680
So I made a big fuss

518
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,890
and started training the harem concubines.

519
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,880
Along the way, this little one sneaked
into the harem,

520
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,030
rather amusing.

521
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,440
Thought I'd catch her to be
my son's companion.

522
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,920
Isn't this perfect?

523
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,750
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!

524
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,440
Consort Yue.

525
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,160
I like you.

526
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,310
I want to be friends with you.

527
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,450
Come with me,

528
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,640
let's go drink!

529
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,480
Go.

530
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,400
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

531
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,730
Let's go drink!

532
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,950
Don't drink too much!

533
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,480
Your Majesty,

534
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,680
it seems there have been
some misunderstandings.

535
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,030
Later, I'll apologize to Yue

536
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,030
on behalf of all the other consorts.

537
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,350
You apologize on behalf of
all the other consorts?

538
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,400
Do you want to be the Empress,

539
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,530
or are you preparing to be
the Empress Dowager directly?

540
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,060
Consort Yue.

541
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,830
You've been in the palace
for quite some time.

542
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,320
But why do you always wear a veil?

543
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,000
Do you have some secret disease?

544
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,880
I... ate too many inflammatory foods
a few days ago

545
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,510
and broke out in a rash all over my face.

546
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,960
Plus, I was born plain.

547
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,140
I feared frightening Your Majesty
and His Majesty.

548
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,200
Take it off!

549
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,070
I said, take off this veil.

550
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,840
Do you know the punishment

551
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,000
for defying my command?

552
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

553
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,360
You look very much like
an old friend of mine.

554
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,170
Your Majesty,

555
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:39,910
I...

556
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,450
You...

557
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,400
look like my dear mother, who passed away
many years ago.

558
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,780
She was also as valiant
and cheerful as you.

559
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,160
I really can't control my emotions.

560
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,420
I've lost my composure.

561
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,540
Quickly, rise.

562
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:04,860
Let's drink!

563
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,050
Back in my day, I also roamed
the martial arts world.

564
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,270
My son

565
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,270
just wanted to be like his grandmother—

566
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,270
someone who fights against injustice

567
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,350
and roams freely as a hero!

568
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,800
Who would have thought...

569
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,710
that he'd become the most suffocated

570
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,360
and the most caged being—an Emperor?

571
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,720
Can the supreme ruler still
feel suffocated?

572
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,910
Utterly suffocated.

573
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,340
Look at his harem,

574
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,220
not a single consort is one
he wanted to marry.

575
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,350
Many rumors in the streets saying

576
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,350
that my son has no interest in women.

577
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,790
It chilled my heart.

578
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,920
Fortunately,

579
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,240
now that you're here, Consort Yue.

580
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,640
I am very pleased!

581
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,070
Drink.

582
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,510
Come on!

583
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,600
People say

584
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,080
that the Dragon Throne is
the highest seat,

585
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
the embodiment of supreme dignity.

586
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,750
Only those who actually sit on it know—

587
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,480
it really hurts your butt!

588
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,270
You can't lean your shoulders
or rest your back.

589
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,780
It's truly exhausting.

590
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,960
But he insists on saying

591
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,270
that someone taught him,

592
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,610
"For a bright and clear world,

593
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,450
for the peace and prosperity
of all people,

594
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,340
bear thousands of burdens in the court

595
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,660
and face countless difficulties
without regret."

596
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,680
Isn't that from my
Outline of the New Governance?

597
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,520
When did I ever teach Huo Jingheng that?

598
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,450
Your Highness,

599
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,000
you're finally back.

600
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,650
Are you alright?

601
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,550
I'll never lose anything again.

602
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,270
Go to the small kitchen for a good meal,

603
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,870
and that's your punishment.

604
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,750
It's been a long day.

605
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,880
I'm going to sleep like a log.

606
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,720
Your Highness,

607
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,160
I forgot to tell you.

608
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,500
His Majesty is waiting for you inside.

609
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,730
Greetings, Your Majesty.

610
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,450
Consort Yue has had a long day.

611
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,920
Would you like to take a relaxing bath?

612
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,090
The weather is dry.

613
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,070
It's not good to bathe too often.

614
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,720
Then, my beloved...

615
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,200
are you ready to rest?

616
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,910
I'm not sleepy at all.

617
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,300
This emperor is too easily bewitched.

618
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,350
I haven't even switched places
with my sister yet.

619
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,080
How did things progress to us
sleeping together?

620
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,210
I am... still young.

621
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,810
I'm not ready yet.

622
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,650
I ask for Your Majesty's patience.

623
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,170
To be honest...

624
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,990
my being an emperor is like being forced

625
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,370
into a role I'm not prepared for.

626
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,940
I think...

627
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,640
it's time... I have a heart-to-heart talk
with you.

628
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,440
I'll have to use this sleeping incense
to put you to sleep.

629
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
This is...

630
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,290
your brother's
Outline of the New Governance.

631
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,510
[Outline of the New Governance]

632
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,590
Such a masterpiece for the ages,

633
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,370
not only did it not earn him a title,

634
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,350
but it's now been reduced to a single
incomplete volume.

635
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,920
Sit.

636
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,630
Your brother was taken too soon
by the heavens.

637
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,640
He was the youngest prime minister
in history.

638
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,290
He made countless achievements
to his name.

639
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
When he died,

640
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,640
you must have felt regret

641
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,790
and unwillingness

642
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,340
for him and for the Yue family,

643
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,240
right?

644
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,270
The consort must not interfere
in politics.

645
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,880
I understand nothing of such things.

646
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,080
If your brother were still alive today,

647
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,550
he would've shaped the dynasty anew.

648
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,720
Of course.

649
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,310
Don't you... have anything you want
to say to me?

650
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,590
Yes.

651
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,760
I thank Your Majesty for honoring
my brother's name.

652
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,420
I am like a delicate willow
swaying in the wind,

653
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,140
thinking that withering and falling
were my fate.

654
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,610
Little did I know that heaven
had other plans

655
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,070
and led me to Your Majesty.

656
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,410
I dare to boldly

657
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,550
ask Your Majesty for a favor.

658
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,410
My beloved, please speak freely.

659
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,160
I will do my utmost to fulfill
your request.

660
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,400
I

661
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,140
want to be the Empress!

662
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,280
Weren't you just pouring your heart out
to me?

663
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,520
Why silent now?

664
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,790
Calm yourself.

665
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,120
This is all for Ling'er.

666
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,410
Your Majesty...

667
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,160
you haven't answered my request yet.

668
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,040
A treasure such as this...

669
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,350
how could you keep it to yourself?

670
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,950
How many more do you have?

671
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,630
Take them out and let me see.

672
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,440
Your Majesty,

673
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,610
I didn't feel it earlier,

674
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,310
but now I'm suddenly overwhelmed
by sleepiness

675
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,300
that I can't even fight it off.

676
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,700
So, my beloved wishes to rest
for the night?

677
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,050
How come I'm suddenly not sleepy anymore?

678
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,090
Your Majesty.

679
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,330
This is a floor rag.

680
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,440
When I said to organize things properly,

681
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,790
I didn't mean for you to mix
everything up completely.

682
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,750
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

683
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,440
I'll go change it right away.

684
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,080
No need.

685
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,000
Go.

686
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,750
Help Consort Yue to bed.

687
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

688
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,410
Your Highness.

689
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,380
You had a good sleep?

690
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,430
Do I look like I got any sleep?

691
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,680
At this rate, I'm afraid I'll ascend
to the heavens

692
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,320
before I ever become Empress.

693
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,650
It's not even 5 a.m. yet.

694
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,160
Where is he going?

695
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,930
His Majesty goes to the warm chamber
half an hour early every day

696
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,790
to review the memorials to be discussed
that day once more,

697
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,000
in case of any oversight.

698
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
His Majesty has been like this
for so many years,

699
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,160
day after day, the same routine,

700
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,440
without a break.

701
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,840
He does sound like a wise ruler.

702
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,190
Everyone says His Majesty is diligent,

703
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,750
unparalleled in history, and unlikely
to be surpassed.

704
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,310
But, Your Highness, why did you just say
"sounds like"?

705
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,560
Well, a wise ruler needs
a virtuous empress to assist him.

706
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,450
As virtuous as I am, I'm not yet
the empress,

707
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,810
so naturally, he can't be considered
a wise ruler yet.

708
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:37,670
Your Highness,

709
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,570
you and His Majesty share
the same interests.

710
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,310
You two seem like a perfect match
no matter how I look at it.

711
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,480
I rather wish he had some other hobbies.

712
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,740
Otherwise, he'll soon drain my fortune.

713
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,430
His Majesty actually treats you
extremely well.

714
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,860
Moreover, he's a man who pays attention
to details despite his rough appearance.

715
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,160
Today, His Majesty specifically

716
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,510
reminded me not to mix up this floor rag

717
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,750
with the face towel.

718
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,020
I didn't say he's not good to me.

719
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,720
I mean...

720
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,950
You're saying that this is a floor rag?

721
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,490
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

722
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,220
Well, you didn't ask me either.

723
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,480
[Zuoshun Gate]

724
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:15,880
Sir,

725
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,350
this is not good!

726
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,480
The city gate is about to close!

727
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,080
It's okay!

728
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,920
Hold on.

729
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,550
Open the gate!

730
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,030
Please forgive us, Your Excellency.

731
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,200
There's nothing to forgive.

732
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,270
I'm the one who delayed
your proper shift change.

733
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,680
Take this jade pendant as a reward.

734
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,110
Take it and treat yourselves.

735
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,480
Hyah.

736
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,510
Hyah!

737
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,110
Who was that?

738
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:38,960
So generous.

739
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,600
The Imperial Uncle.

740
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:39,980
[Du Tianzhao, Brother of Du Sanniang]

741
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,310
The current Prime Minister, Du Tianzhao.

742
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,280
Your Majesty,

743
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,310
I have an important matter to report.
