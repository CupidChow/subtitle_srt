00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,840
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,070
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

4
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,500
Her Ladyship is back!

5
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,640
My Lady.

6
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:17,350
Uncle Liu.

7
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,870
-You're back.
-The moment I heard your loud voice,

8
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,289
I knew I was home.

9
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,640
Come on, give that to me.

10
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,940
Ling'er.

11
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,039
This girl...

12
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,720
Now that I have a sister-in-law,
I've forgotten about my brother.

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,820
Yunqing,

14
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,440
I begged the Empress Dowager

15
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,380
for a long time

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,350
before she finally agreed

17
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,720
to let me come home quietly.

18
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,840
But we've only been apart for...

19
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,539
Stop counting.

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
I just missed you.

21
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,130
It's so lively here.

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,220
What are you doing?

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,580
Watching Miss Jiang practice swordsmanship.

24
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,610
Her skills

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,400
are truly remarkable.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,460
Of course they are.

27
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,320
Alright, that's enough.

28
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,850
It's good to be home.

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,759
Uncle Liu.

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,340
Come and have

31
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,590
some buns, your favorite.

32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,430
I brought them over

33
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,960
straight from the steamer.

34
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,860
Don't just grab them like that!

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,720
It's been so long since we last met.

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Shall we catch up?

37
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,890
Don't just focus on eating.

38
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,820
Don't forget what you promised me.

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,920
That year, on your sixteenth birthday,

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,710
that was the first time I met you.

41
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,260
I brought you a gift, remember?

42
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,590
Even then, I knew

43
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,190
we'd become

44
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,120
good friends.

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,670
Even if

46
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,710
you and my brother

47
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,410
hadn't fallen for each other later,

48
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,370
I believe

49
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,530
we would still have

50
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,870
become close friends.

51
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,860
Right?

52
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,280
Yes.

53
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,490
Why are you eating so fast?

54
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Are you a soldier?

55
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,600
Am I?

56
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,140
And you,

57
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,380
don't you like the food?

58
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,010
Why aren't you eating at all?

59
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,960
It's not that.

60
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,000
Maybe it's because

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,740
I've been out in the world for so long

62
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,280
that the palace food

63
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,760
seems tasteless to me now.

64
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,550
You're the Emperor now,

65
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,470
staying in

66
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,120
Yongqian Palace every day.

67
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,240
Are you really that busy

68
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,590
with state affairs?

69
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,660
Recently,

70
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,710
I've indeed been busy with state affairs.

71
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,470
But you're right—

72
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,190
I should practice martial arts more.

73
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,280
I'm getting rusty.

74
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,980
Exactly.

75
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,400
You need to practice martial arts more.

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,770
Don't just sit around.

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,980
I'll walk around more

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,290
and not practice martial arts.

79
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,100
You should practice martial arts too.

80
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,550
But don't just practice inside the palace.

81
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,790
Otherwise, what you're practicing

82
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,680
will be heartless swordsmanship.

83
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,000
Mother,

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,150
what exactly do you want me to do?

85
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,150
Just tell me.

86
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,680
Don't you feel like

87
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,470
the palace

88
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,400
has been missing something lately?

89
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,030
It's Consort Yue.

90
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,150
She's been home for two days.

91
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,630
See?

92
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,750
Even your uncle noticed.

93
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,310
Consort Yue's been gone this long

94
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,400
and you haven't

95
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,660
gone to see her.

96
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,810
You think I don't want to go?

97
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,920
I'll go.

98
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,560
I'm annoying people in the palace.

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,190
Alright, alright.

100
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:26,870
What are you doing?

101
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,930
What are you doing?

102
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,870
I'll take my dear nephew out for a walk.

103
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,190
-No need for that.
-No need for that.

104
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,870
Sit down!

105
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,190
I'm full,

106
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,000
Sister.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,800
Eat a bit more.

108
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,010
[Prime Minister's Mansion]

109
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,360
Several of your outfits

110
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,260
got stained.

111
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,310
The maid didn't notice

112
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,430
and tore a cuff.

113
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,480
I've mended it for you.

114
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,280
Yue...

115
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,200
Ling...

116
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,790
er.

117
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,420
Uncle Liu,

118
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,520
thank you for taking care of me. We...

119
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,680
Uncle Liu,

120
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,160
you have a lot to do today.

121
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,890
Please go ahead with your work.

122
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,680
Uncle Liu, let me see you out.

123
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,310
When exactly are you leaving?

124
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,750
Have you set a date?

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,750
Chi.

126
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,490
I've decided.

127
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm not leaving.

128
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,840
Yue Ling'er!

129
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,510
What did I

130
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,510
call you back for?

131
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,480
If you can't handle such
a small matter properly,

132
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll send you back

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,330
to the palace tomorrow.

134
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,510
Yunqing!

135
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,840
It's so early in the morning.

136
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,640
What are you making a fuss about?

137
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,800
Come, sit down.

138
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,370
Right, Chi.

139
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,590
Didn't you just say

140
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,830
you had something to attend to?

141
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,390
Go ahead.

142
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,560
I'm going to chat with Yunqing

143
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,310
for a while.

144
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,090
Did you sleep well last night?

145
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,950
We're going to

146
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,720
talk about

147
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,950
some girl stuff.

148
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,240
You want to join?

149
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:55,820
You two chat.

150
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,280
Yunqing,

151
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,740
while you're staying here,

152
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,890
treat it as your home.

153
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Why are you here?

154
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,460
I'm here to pick up Consort Yue.

155
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,690
Go ahead.

156
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:10,880
Those two are so close that they could

157
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,570
even sleep in the same room at night.

158
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,170
I doubt you can take her away.

159
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,510
He's like a shadow,

160
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,920
always clinging

161
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,160
to Ling'er.

162
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,520
Ling'er.

163
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,550
Huo Jingheng?

164
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,730
Mind your manners.

165
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,590
Yunqing,

166
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,740
don't go over there.

167
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,070
Yunqing,

168
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,610
this is the etiquette of Former Ning.

169
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,409
Your hand gesture is incorrect.

170
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,440
Please rise.

171
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,190
Ling'er,

172
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,270
I brought you your favorite pastries

173
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,630
from the palace.

174
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,340
Well,

175
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,070
is there any hibiscus hawthorn cake?

176
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,600
I don't remember the names,

177
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,600
but there are

178
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,480
red ones, blue ones,

179
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,800
green ones, purple ones—

180
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,000
all kinds of colors.

181
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
The red ones

182
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,420
are hibiscus hawthorn cakes.

183
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,300
The yellow ones

184
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,260
are chrysanthemum crab pastries.

185
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,320
The green ones are mung bean cakes.

186
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,210
And the purple ones

187
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,580
are mashed yam

188
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,200
mixed with grass dragon fruit juice.

189
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,900
What's grass dragon fruit?

190
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,450
Oh, my memory is terrible.

191
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,230
In the previous dynasty,
grass dragon fruit was...

192
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,410
It's grape.

193
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,310
I always get these two names mixed up.

194
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,000
Seriously,

195
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,790
why do they always change things' names?

196
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,280
Prime Minister Yue.

197
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:39,970
Go.

198
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,060
Bring me a clean outfit.

199
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,380
Mine got stained on the way here.

200
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,900
Your Majesty.

201
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,950
Go ahead.

202
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,870
Don't worry.

203
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,030
I don't eat grapes.

204
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,130
And I don't eat people either.

205
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,500
Consort Yue.

206
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,320
It's been a long time

207
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,060
since I last tasted your craft brew.

208
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,830
But...

209
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,640
Just go.

210
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,750
Miss Jiang,

211
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,620
I didn't expect you

212
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,070
to be so fond of pastries.

213
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,250
I come from a different background,

214
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,650
so I've seen more.

215
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,549
Miss Jiang,

216
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,880
what are your plans for the future?

217
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,299
Naturally,

218
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,909
to find a goal

219
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,400
and steadily climb upwards.

220
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,140
That makes sense.

221
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,710
But I think

222
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,160
the water towns in Jiangnan

223
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,390
are better for long-term living.

224
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,980
Why struggle

225
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,360
to climb so hard?

226
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,540
Jiangnan's scenery is beautiful,

227
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,140
but it's not like the capital

228
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,620
where dazzling flowers confuse the eyes,

229
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,340
blending prosperity and elegance.

230
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,660
Who wouldn't love it?

231
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,750
Your Majesty,

232
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,600
if you find Jiangnan's scenery so lovely,

233
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,250
why not change your mindset

234
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,260
and move there?

235
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,540
Why are you walking so fast?

236
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,460
Slow down.

237
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,270
This lantern is pretty cute,

238
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,490
just like you.

239
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,000
Let me buy it for you as a gift.

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,240
It is quite cute.

241
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,080
But...

242
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,570
the Mid-Autumn Festival is already over.

243
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,120
What use do I have for a lantern?

244
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,610
Can't I just give you a gift?

245
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,140
Here.

246
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,520
This lantern is so cute.

247
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,810
Ling'er, can I take a look at it?

248
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,030
Sure.

249
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,070
Of course.

250
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,280
It's quite cute.

251
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,080
Yes, it is.

252
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,170
When I was young, I was constantly
on the move

253
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,320
and couldn't afford them.

254
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,150
Later, after entering the palace,

255
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,390
I never got to see them again.

256
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,750
I always envied others who had them

257
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,750
when I was little.

258
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,200
Well...

259
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,600
Yunqing,

260
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,270
it's yours now.

261
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,890
Is that alright, Your Majesty?

262
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,960
Alright, Your Majesty?

263
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,870
It's okay.

264
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,480
His Majesty will agree.

265
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,630
Take it.

266
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,140
It looks quite lively over there.

267
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,200
I'll go take a look.

268
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,690
People want a lot of things,

269
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,670
but not everything

270
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,030
can go their way.

271
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,890
How would you know if you don't try?

272
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,850
I once walked a long way

273
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,890
and reached a position

274
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,490
I never thought I could.

275
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,570
I suppose that counts...

276
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,340
as getting what I wished for.

277
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,910
Then congratulations, Miss Jiang,

278
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,750
for having such good luck.

279
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,180
I hope it

280
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,550
stays with you.

281
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,150
With Your Majesty's blessing,

282
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,010
I'm sure I will get what I wish for.

283
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,760
Yunqing,

284
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,050
what were you...

285
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,020
talking about just now?

286
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,090
Nothing.

287
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,020
I was just thanking His Majesty

288
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,140
for this gift.

289
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,530
I'll treasure it well.

290
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,210
His Majesty is truly

291
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,280
kind

292
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,480
and benevolent.

293
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,270
His Majesty is truly kind and benevolent.

294
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,960
Nothing.

295
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,790
I was just thanking His Majesty

296
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,840
for this gift.

297
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,220
I'll treasure it well.

298
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,220
Ling'er.

299
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,620
Ling'er,

300
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,110
you went out shopping?

301
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,220
His Majesty didn't get mad, did he?

302
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,370
Don't just say "mm-hmm."

303
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,390
Do you know how serious

304
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,250
this matter is?

305
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,200
Are you even listening to me?

306
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,840
Her Ladyship must be exhausted.

307
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,890
Go get some rest.

308
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,730
Go get some rest.

309
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,660
Have a break.

310
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,330
She likes him.

311
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,870
She doesn't like him.

312
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,940
She likes him.

313
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,640
She doesn't like him.

314
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,360
Does Yunqing...

315
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,670
like His Majesty?

316
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,320
Why do I even care

317
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,030
whether Yunqing

318
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,030
likes His Majesty or not?

319
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,710
Oh no.

320
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,180
I'm done for.

321
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,080
Stop thinking about it anymore.

322
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,270
Ling'er.

323
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,730
What's wrong with you?

324
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,640
It's nothing.

325
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,080
I accidentally fell

326
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,000
just now.

327
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,090
How could you be so clumsy?

328
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,200
Are you hurt?

329
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Did you not

330
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,690
sleep well last night?

331
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,700
Your face looks so pale,

332
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,170
and you have dark circles under your eyes.

333
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,470
What's wrong?

334
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,270
Is there

335
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,150
something bothering you?

336
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,220
Yunqing,

337
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,430
last night...

338
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,260
I had a nightmare.

339
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,920
It's alright.

340
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,960
Nightmares aren't real.

341
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,900
Aren't you going to ask me

342
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,750
what dream I had?

343
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,510
Alright.

344
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
What nightmare did you have?

345
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,870
I dreamed that

346
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,720
we both wanted

347
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,840
the same pillow at the same time

348
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,190
and ended up arguing about it.

349
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,510
I thought it was some terrible nightmare.

350
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,750
If that really happens,

351
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,120
I'll give the pillow

352
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,870
to you.

353
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,250
And also,

354
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,020
if you want a pillow,

355
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,770
I'll find

356
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,600
the best one in the world for you.

357
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,920
Yunqing.

358
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,450
Alright.

359
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,270
Are you still sleepy?

360
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,240
I'll be with you.

361
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,240
If you are,

362
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,500
just take a little nap.

363
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,020
Yunqing is so good to me.

364
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,600
If she really likes His Majesty,

365
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,910
and His Majesty likes her too,

366
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,790
then I...

367
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,140
Your Majesty, are you thinking about
the princess from the previous dynasty?

368
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,230
I think

369
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,980
she likes Your Majesty.

370
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,600
I think...

371
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,670
you should stop thinking.

372
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,770
With Your Majesty's blessing,

373
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,630
I'm sure I will get what I wish for.

374
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,300
Things don't always

375
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,580
go as you wish.

376
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,400
Wei Zhang.

377
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

378
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,670
I heard the Empress Dowager has been

379
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,340
very attentive to Fengluan Palace lately.

380
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,320
How is it?

381
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,270
Another new batch is here.

382
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,680
Your Majesty.

383
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,330
Consort Yue has settled in at her residence.

384
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,780
There's another girl in her household,

385
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,440
and they get along quite well.

386
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,430
That's good.

387
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,290
Your Majesty.

388
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,430
Today, His Majesty went again

389
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,630
to visit Consort Yue.

390
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,109
Her Highness and Miss Yunqing

391
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,740
spent the day embroidering pouches.

392
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,319
Miss Yunqing again?

393
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,630
Miss Yunqing, Miss Yunqing...

394
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,700
Miss Yunqing?

395
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,109
Why is it Miss Yunqing again?

396
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,560
What exactly does she do?

397
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,500
Is she married?

398
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,710
Your Majesty, she is still unmarried.

399
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,770
She's said to be Her Highness's
close friend.

400
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,800
I think she

401
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,680
has also been captivated by His Majesty.

402
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,550
I knew something wasn't right.

403
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,010
What close friend?

404
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,090
It's just a cover to steal her man.

405
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,460
I need to go and deal with her.

406
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,420
Wait, Sister.

407
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,300
Love

408
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,000
is based on mutual consent.

409
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,500
What's this talk of stealing men?

410
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,780
You shouldn't interfere.

411
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,690
Stop talking nonsense.

412
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,750
Why are you everywhere?

413
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,340
Go.

414
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,900
Bring them all

415
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,090
to my Shoukang Palace for a gathering.

416
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,190
Empress Dowager's decree:

417
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,970
Miss Yunqing,

418
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,460
who lacks womanly virtue,

419
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,870
doesn't know her place,

420
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,280
and overstepped her social status...

421
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,440
What a vixen.

422
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,010
She just doesn't look like someone
who knows her place.

423
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,270
...shall never set foot
in the capital again.

424
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,220
[Decree]

425
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,500
I...

426
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,090
accept the decree.

427
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,580
Your Majesty, please show mercy.

428
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,390
Yunqing

429
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,010
is my brother's...

430
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,360
She once saved Prime Minister Yue's life.

431
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,010
You'd better shut up now.

432
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,170
What was your brother's status
in the previous dynasty?

433
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,290
How important must someone have been

434
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,340
to be betrothed to her?

435
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,020
Once my mother traces this back
and uncovers the truth,

436
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,150
your Sister Yunqing won't even
have a whole corpse left.

437
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,460
She saved his life?

438
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,650
How did she save his life?

439
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,200
Well...

440
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,320
Well...

441
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,530
She saved me when...

442
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,330
Don't say I didn't help you.

443
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,400
Two years ago,

444
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,250
after I was shot in the chest
by His Majesty's arrow,

445
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,250
it was thanks to Miss Yunqing's care

446
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,930
that I survived to this day.

447
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,270
So, you're saying...

448
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,280
she helped clean up the mess my son made?

449
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,650
I wouldn't dare think that way.

450
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,830
This matter

451
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,840
was because of me in the first place.

452
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,630
The fact that you say that
just shows you're overthinking it.

453
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,440
Although you were new to herbs at the time

454
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,370
and almost made my condition worse,

455
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,090
it was actually those two plasters

456
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,840
that ended up working through the
principle of fighting poison with poison

457
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,000
and even healed the old abscess

458
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I had from before.

459
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,400
You know medicine too?

460
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,040
No wonder you're always

461
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,110
with our Consort Yue

462
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,540
at Prince Anle's Mansion.

463
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,950
If you're truly close friends,

464
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,510
you should

465
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,680
help Consort Yue

466
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,270
take good care of her health

467
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,210
so she can

468
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,930
have a son

469
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,950
for the Emperor as soon as possible.

470
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,380
You little vixen,

471
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,900
look how capable you are.

472
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,030
Ling'er is still young.

473
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,580
And after her miscarriage,

474
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,000
she should focus on resting.

475
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,810
If you're so desperate for an heir,

476
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,190
perhaps you should look for someone
stronger and healthier.

477
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:56,950
Nonsense!

478
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,950
How vicious she is.

479
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,860
Not only is she trying to sow discord
between me and Yue Chi,

480
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,030
now she wants to break me and Ling'er too.

481
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,430
Stronger and healthier?

482
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,830
People who practice martial arts

483
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,400
are usually strong and healthy.

484
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,860
Is Yunqing talking about herself?

485
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,120
Alas... Looks like Yunqing

486
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,110
really likes Huo Jingheng.

487
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,530
Our Consort Yue is in excellent health.

488
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,640
Emperor,

489
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,350
say something.

490
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,790
Mother,

491
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,540
please don't worry.

492
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,930
I have absolutely

493
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,180
no feelings

494
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,700
for this lady.

495
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,430
She saved Prime Minister Yue's life.

496
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,350
If there's any bond,

497
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,920
it's between them—

498
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,360
that's what made

499
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,030
her life-saving act

500
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,750
happen.

501
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,160
Having saved your trusted minister,

502
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,930
I can die with no regrets.

503
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,010
How can you die?

504
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,570
I haven't even had the chance
to thank you yet.

505
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,550
Can you make this woman

506
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,850
shut her mouth?

507
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Thank her?

508
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,150
Well,

509
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,120
How are you going to thank her?

510
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,530
It's okay. I'll thank her.

511
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,930
I dare not trouble Your Majesty.

512
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,690
Oh, right.

513
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:57,930
I...

514
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,790
cannot do it for you.

515
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,220
Thank her?

516
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,000
You're sensible. I can give you that.

517
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,970
Alright, it's getting late.

518
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,470
Mother, you've been talking for a while.

519
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,580
You must be thirsty.

520
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,400
Have some more tea.

521
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,160
Alright.

522
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,440
It's also

523
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,510
time to eat.

524
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,530
Let's not stay here and bother
Her Majesty any longer.

525
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,730
You may leave now.

526
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,580
Hurry up and take her away.

527
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,030
I will

528
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,060
takes my leave.

529
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,660
Come on, get up.

530
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,600
[Visionary Insight]

531
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,990
You have no appetite?

532
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,710
Then you must still be angry.

533
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,620
The doctor said

534
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,390
you need to nourish your body.

535
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,310
Doctors

536
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,580
always have a lot to say.

537
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,730
Yunqing,

538
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,370
you can't carry too much burden

539
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,610
in your lifetime.

540
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
You need to leave yourself a way out.

541
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,990
I don't know what you're talking about.

542
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,640
Look at other bright places.

543
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,880
Don't always trap yourself

544
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,480
where you only see darkness.

545
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,370
There are other directions.

546
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,590
I can accompany you to find them.

547
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,250
So?

548
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,640
The direction you've found

549
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,120
is to willingly

550
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,640
become his right-hand man.

551
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,830
Back then,
before I went to the battlefield,

552
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,590
you said you wanted the people
to live in peace and prosperity.

553
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,160
The people of Former Ning and those now

554
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
are no different.

555
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,650
Unfortunately,

556
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,830
he's just a brute.

557
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,410
How could he know
how to be a good emperor?

558
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,870
It's precisely because he comes from
a humble background,

559
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,400
he understands the suffering
of the common people.

560
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,200
The people need such an emperor,

561
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,080
and I'll do everything I can

562
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,910
to assist him.

563
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,250
I hope so.

564
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,080
I'm just afraid that you'll devote
yourself to him wholeheartedly,

565
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,420
only to be discarded

566
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,300
when you're no longer useful.

567
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,940
So,

568
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,830
from the very start, you never planned

569
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,960
to stay and see

570
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,550
if he's truly

571
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,960
a ruler worth following,

572
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,830
did you?

573
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,110
[Yongqian Palace]

574
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,330
Where can we go to grab a bite?

575
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,410
How about...

576
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,900
Fengluan Palace?

577
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,780
She hasn't left?

578
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,670
No, she hasn't.

579
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,970
Let's go, let's go.

580
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,200
To Fengluan Palace!

581
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:21,920
Let's go.

582
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,970
Ling'er!

583
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,080
Great, great.

584
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,190
It's quite nice.

585
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,850
All these things have been moved back, huh?

586
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,650
So you finally

587
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,480
don't have to live at your sister's
place anymore?

588
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,310
In a few days, once I've calmed

589
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,920
the Empress Dowager down,

590
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,270
you can bring her into the palace.

591
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,610
No need, no need.

592
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,110
That Yunqing

593
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,310
of yours

594
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,460
keeps coming to see me again and again.

595
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,090
It's quite annoying.

596
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,370
You...

597
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,750
don't like her?

598
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,590
Of course not.

599
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,110
But...

600
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,360
I think Yunqing seems

601
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,920
to quite like Your Majesty.

602
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

603
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,140
Think about it.

604
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,940
When she looks at me,

605
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,730
what kind of look does she have?

606
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,200
How could she like me?

607
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,870
It's a miracle she hasn't killed me yet.

608
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,940
Really?

609
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,580
Of course.

610
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,120
I assure you,

611
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,890
she absolutely does not like me.

612
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,730
Well then.

613
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,640
If that's the case,

614
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,370
I feel much more at ease.

615
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,730
Just thinking about this annoys me.

616
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,240
I already told Yue Chi that I just

617
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,120
wanted her to leave the capital

618
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,240
and that I wouldn't harm her.

619
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,060
And if he's really worried,

620
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,190
he can send guards to protect her.

621
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,200
But your brother

622
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,600
just won't agree.

623
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,500
Every time I think about it,

624
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,340
I get mad.

625
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,120
How have I been treating him?

626
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,510
He's even harboring a princess
from the previous dynasty.

627
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,580
Jingheng,

628
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,790
listen to me.

629
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,350
Although Yunqing is a princess

630
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,880
from the previous dynasty,

631
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,270
don't treat her like a princess.

632
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,450
She

633
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,690
would never

634
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,790
do anything

635
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,680
to your empire

636
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,880
for wealth and glory.

637
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,680
What do you mean by

638
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,180
"don't treat her like a princess?"

639
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,560
You see, she's usually

640
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,370
very approachable

641
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,480
and she's very frugal.

642
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,790
She treats everyone around her

643
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,590
very well,

644
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,680
truly well.

645
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,270
In short, she's a good princess.

646
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,300
Did Jiang Yunqing

647
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,120
save your life?

648
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,220
Why are you praising her like this?

649
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,300
She did save me.

650
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,960
But compared to

651
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,510
the relationship between
my brother and Yunqing,

652
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,640
it's nothing.

653
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,930
They've been close

654
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,480
since childhood,

655
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,990
and later

656
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,290
they got engaged.

657
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,160
She almost became

658
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,270
my sister-in-law.

659
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,540
This princess

660
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,950
looks so miserable.

661
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,920
She doesn't have
an auspicious look at all.

662
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,720
I don't know

663
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,410
what your brother sees in her.

664
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,310
Why are you laughing?

665
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,790
Whether Your Majesty likes her or not,

666
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,650
to my brother, Yunqing

667
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,060
is a treasure,

668
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,880
a lost gem found again.

669
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,030
So my brother

670
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,230
inevitably becomes overly concerned.

671
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,960
You

672
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,550
and Yunqing

673
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,600
are both very important to my brother,

674
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,160
people he wants to protect.

675
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,400
He doesn't want you

676
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,350
to destroy each other

677
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,410
because of some baseless suspicion.

678
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,700
Your Majesty, think about it.

679
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,790
On one side is his long-lost

680
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,000
beloved,

681
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,110
and on the other

682
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,920
is a wise, capable,

683
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,190
and just ruler

684
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,160
who can fulfill his ambitions.

685
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,420
He doesn't dare to risk

686
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,400
either side.

687
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,880
The only thing

688
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,400
he can do

689
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,960
is keep you apart.

690
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,350
Is there

691
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,440
any better way

692
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,480
than this?

693
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,410
Ling'er,

694
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,030
what angers me

695
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,030
is not that

696
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,880
your brother has dealings

697
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,350
with the princess of the previous dynasty,

698
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,180
but the unfairness in it.

699
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,250
I trust your brother...

700
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,960
this much,

701
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,100
yet he always

702
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,830
seems to

703
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,350
keep a distance from me.

704
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,410
I feel his trust in me

705
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,630
is only this much.

706
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,790
Why does this taste so sour?

707
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,710
I'm sorry.

708
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,480
I'll adjust it.

709
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,100
However,

710
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,760
it has quite a unique flavor.

711
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,510
You're not just trying to
comfort me, are you?

712
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,550
I'm not.

713
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,310
I really think

714
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,570
this wine tastes good.

715
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,870
So,

716
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,770
everyone has their own taste.

717
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,870
No matter

718
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,350
how good that princess

719
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,090
of the previous dynasty is

720
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,090
to you

721
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,910
and your brother,

722
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,770
I will never like her.

723
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,260
Why didn't you use the main entrance?

724
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,640
If I had used the main entrance,
it would've meant I was coming as the emperor.

725
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,920
You would have to welcome me
late at night,

726
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,710
causing the whole household to be disturbed

727
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,670
with everyone kneeling on the ground.

728
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,200
She might have started
causing trouble again.

729
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,940
Wouldn't that be a hassle for you?

730
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,740
Wouldn't that be a hassle for me?

731
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,740
Here.

732
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,350
A duck from the Imperial Lake.

733
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,890
And the wine brewed by Ling'er.

734
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,650
Here.

735
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,550
I understand

736
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,130
how deeply you care for Jiang Yunqing.

737
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,050
And you're afraid that

738
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,880
I might be wary of her background.

739
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,380
So you want to protect her.

740
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,400
Today, I promise you

741
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,140
I will never constrain her

742
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,770
because of her background.

743
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:13,910
Even if

744
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,130
Jiang Yunqing stays in your residence,

745
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,160
I won't interfere.

746
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,840
But from today on,

747
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,760
I hope there will be

748
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,270
no more secrets

749
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,960
between us.

750
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,860
Take it.

751
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,700
What an interesting way to eat.

752
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,970
Why is this wine so sour?

753
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,540
Your sister once brewed a fine wine

754
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,960
that was highly praised.

755
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,440
She wasn't satisfied with just that

756
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,180
and wants to become a master brewer.

757
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,010
So...

758
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,260
she started

759
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,740
developing new products.

760
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,400
But in fact,

761
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,120
sometimes,

762
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,540
stepping down at the peak

763
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,020
isn't a bad thing.

764
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
At the very least,

765
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,590
you get to become

766
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,780
a legend.

767
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,100
This was brewed by Ling'er.

768
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,390
Have a proper taste.

769
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,440
A proper taste?

770
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,240
It's actually pretty good.

771
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,500
That's exactly what I said back then.

772
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,720
You're quite clever.

773
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,440
Could it be that

774
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,840
after being impressed by my talent,

775
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,240
you started thinking everything

776
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,770
about Ling'er is great too?

777
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,250
Have you ever thought that

778
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,930
maybe it was because I like Ling'er

779
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,780
that I consequently find you
agreeable too?

780
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,010
Hypocrite.

781
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:49,920
Cheers.

782
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,870
It's fine.

783
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,960
I'm leaving.

784
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,190
Be careful.

785
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,750
He came here

786
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,360
just to promise you safety.

787
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,660
Maybe it's because he's newly
ascended the throne

788
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,120
and still has compassion.

789
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,160
Or maybe...

790
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,360
he's really different.

791
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
You trust the promise of an emperor?

792
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,350
Fine.

793
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,790
But don't forget,

794
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,350
I'm just

795
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,620
a woman from the previous royal family.
I'm nothing

796
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,480
like the crown prince
from the previous dynasty.

797
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,440
This matter touches the very foundation
of the two dynasties.

798
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,440
Even if Huo Jingheng

799
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,550
is generous and broad-minded,

800
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,270
would the entire court

801
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,480
simply stand by and do nothing?

802
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,720
Only he knows.

803
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,720
It might not alarm the entire court.

804
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,550
Might not?

805
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,640
Even you said "might not."

806
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,100
That means it's possible.

807
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,960
Do you want to risk Shuo's life

808
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,110
just because you

809
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,890
feel a little guilty right now?

810
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,110
Of course not.

811
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,310
Is this the answer you give me

812
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,790
after these past few days?

813
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:19,690
Sir,

814
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:20,840
Yue Chi

815
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,400
sometimes leaves home early
and returns late.

816
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,739
When there's a lot of official business,

817
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,790
he even stays overnight in the palace.

818
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,989
It's really difficult for us to use him.

819
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,320
Sir.

820
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,929
Sir.

821
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,400
Sir.

822
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,699
Sir.

823
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,110
Sir.

824
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,890
I remember Fengluan Palace

825
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,430
was the palace of the Empress
of Former Ning.

826
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,080
Now, seeing Yue Ling'er

827
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,060
living there,

828
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,750
do you feel comforted

829
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,370
or upset?

830
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,350
Sir, please spare me.

831
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,590
I have followed your orders.

832
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,670
But Huo Jingheng acts unpredictably.

833
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,030
I have deliberately exposed flaws
many times,

834
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,740
yet I just can't provoke him.

835
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,110
He's simply not taking any action.

836
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,920
Alright.

837
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,480
Then stay here

838
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,050
and think of a solution.

839
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,210
Sir.

840
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,590
Sir!

841
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Sir!

842
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,290
What is the Empress Dowager doing?

843
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,650
I will go check on her.

844
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,060
Protect His Majesty!

845
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,790
Chase after that person!

846
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,830
[Jiang Yunshuo, The Crown Prince of the Previous Dynasty.
He was cared for by Yue Chi for many years.]

847
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,650
Yue Chi,

848
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,740
you'd better give me an explanation.
