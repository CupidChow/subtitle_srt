[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,880
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,300
[Yongqian Palace]

4
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,560
He just disappeared in the capital.

5
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,250
This is absurd.

6
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,110
How is Prime Minister Yue?

7
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,340
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

8
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,400
Prime Minister Yue is fine.

9
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,980
He has returned home to recuperate.

10
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,750
Mm.

11
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,780
Let him recover first.

12
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,860
I never expected that behind Man King,

13
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,750
there would be such powerful forces.

14
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,009
Who could it be?

15
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,310
I've sent people

16
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,430
to thoroughly check the posthouses
in the outskirts of the city.

17
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,430
Since the person who helped him

18
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,680
managed to take him away
under the heavy surveillance

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,590
of the capital,

20
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,950
they certainly won't be waiting
at a posthouse for us to catch them.

21
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,940
Then...

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,289
we just let them escape?

23
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,310
Given the circumstances,

24
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,640
we can only wait now.

25
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,750
You finally came back.

26
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,449
Sir.

27
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,010
I thought I'd never see you again.

28
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,430
I wouldn't dare.

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
It's just that Yue Chi

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,430
has been

31
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,350
looking for me these past few days.

32
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,260
Do you remember what I told you?

33
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,310
Assassinate Huo Jingheng

34
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,970
and cause chaos in Later Ning.

35
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,840
It seems

36
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,850
you didn't get what I meant.

37
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,079
Sir,

38
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,579
it's my fault.

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,240
I never believed
you could assassinate Huo Jingheng.

40
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,350
Huo Jingheng

41
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,970
is a man who got the throne on horseback.

42
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,190
You think you can assassinate him?

43
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,220
Don't you think your identity
as the princess of the former dynasty

44
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,280
is more interesting
than assassinating Huo Jingheng?

45
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,510
If you were detained,

46
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,060
would Yue Chi...

47
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,860
would Yue Chi send the Qilin Army

48
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,570
to rescue you, his fiancée?

49
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,150
By that time,

50
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,790
Ning State would surely fall into chaos,

51
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,110
suffering endlessly,

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,580
just like you.

53
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,820
Sir, please don't.

54
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,610
Sir.

55
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,670
Sir.

56
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,450
Sir!

57
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,730
Sir!

58
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,000
Sir.

59
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,829
Ah!

60
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,190
Sir!

61
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Sir!

62
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,110
Sir!

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,950
Sir.

64
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,400
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,930
Just a small punishment.

66
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,530
You won't be angry, will you?

67
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,110
I will do my utmost in the future.

68
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,529
I won't let you down again.

69
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,610
I never like to coerce others.

70
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,080
I prefer people to work for me willingly.

71
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,110
I'll attempt another assassination

72
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,490
at any cost

73
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,140
to cause chaos in Later Ning.

74
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,900
I believe you have the courage
to enter the palace again.

75
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,790
After all, you almost left
even with poison in your body.

76
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,830
At the dock,

77
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,100
if my people hadn't seen you,

78
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,670
you would have been long gone, right?

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,950
Sir.

80
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,640
Never mind.

81
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,190
Tell me about Yue Chi.

82
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,650
Is there anything special about him?

83
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,690
If it weren't for you,

84
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,140
I would have been killed by Yue Chi today.

85
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,810
I just didn't expect your archery skills
to be so good.

86
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,750
Thanks to your cultivation,

87
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,310
I've learned such great archery skills.

88
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,500
I just hope that one day,

89
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,500
your arrows won't be aimed at me.

90
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,810
I wouldn't dare.

91
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,930
I was just saying.

92
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,410
Your nervousness

93
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,250
makes me think
you truly had such thoughts.

94
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,100
When Ning Dynasty fell,

95
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,820
you took me in.

96
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,160
I'm deeply grateful.

97
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,340
Never mind.

98
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,350
It sounds like I'm pressing you too hard.

99
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,770
What do you think
we should do about Yue Chi?

100
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,080
I dare not make decisions on my own.

101
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,470
Please tell me what to do.

102
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,090
If I invite him to be the prince regent,

103
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,860
based on what you know of him,

104
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
would he come?

105
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,840
The prince regent?

106
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,909
Since he served Former Ning,

107
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,610
Li State has suffered defeat after defeat.

108
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,700
His talents and abilities

109
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,820
have been proven.

110
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,570
It's just the title of the prince regent.

111
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,170
What's there to worry about?

112
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,409
But Yue Chi...

113
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,950
doesn't care about his rank.

114
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,000
He cares more about
the people and the Yue family.

115
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,330
And he's not someone
who easily changes his allegiance.

116
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,140
Since you believe

117
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,910
Yue Chi won't easily abandon Huo Jingheng,

118
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,880
you go and force him.

119
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,800
Be my eyes

120
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,800
and my hands.

121
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,610
Drive a wedge between them.

122
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,860
Disrupt Ning.

123
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,320
Can you do that?

124
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,210
But it doesn't matter.

125
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,250
I have many ways to make sure you can.

126
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,790
Yunqing.

127
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,890
You're hurt.

128
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,870
It'll hurt a bit.

129
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,090
Put up with it.

130
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,460
You still couldn't let it go,

131
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,380
so you risked entering the palace again.

132
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,880
You have your ambitions

133
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,830
and aspirations.

134
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,150
I have things I must do.

135
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,320
That day, I failed
to meet you outside the city gate.

136
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,560
It was my fault.

137
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,780
But it wasn't for
the pursuit of power or status.

138
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,910
I risked becoming the prime minister.

139
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,630
It has already made me
surrounded by enemies in the court.

140
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,090
If I had kept you by my side,

141
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,500
it would have put you in danger.

142
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,650
Where have you been

143
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,580
all this time?

144
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,460
The wanted posters are all over the city.

145
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,480
Where else could I go?

146
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,040
I've been hiding.

147
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,520
It won't happen again.

148
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,390
I will protect you.

149
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,460
But Yunqing,

150
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,270
promise me

151
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,550
you won't risk your life again.

152
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,390
Let me take you back to rest.

153
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,920
Yue Chi.

154
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,550
I've been forced

155
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,410
into this situation.

156
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,730
Is it laughable

157
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,440
and pathetic?

158
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,480
Not at all.

159
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,400
In my eyes,

160
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,080
you've always been that graceful princess.

161
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,900
Since I first saw you.

162
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,640
You first saw me?

163
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,760
I must be

164
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,220
so different from back then.

165
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,870
Yunqing.

166
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,580
I'm reminded of the old days.

167
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,120
Play a tune for me,

168
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,990
okay?

169
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,160
Okay.

170
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,010
Play "Melody of the Orchids".

171
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,860
I'll play it.

172
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,970
So that's the princess
who lived outside the palace?

173
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,470
I heard a few years ago,
there was a great fire at Cheng'en Temple,

174
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,390
and the princess was killed by bad guys.

175
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,530
No.

176
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,190
Cheng'en Temple was attacked.

177
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,860
The empress protected the princess
and helped her escape.

178
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,120
She herself was killed by the attackers.

179
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,770
The princess was lost for seven years
among the common folk before returning.

180
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:08,930
She must have suffered a lot.

181
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,220
[Fengyuan Hall]

182
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,190
You've got some nerve.

183
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,320
Leave.

184
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,890
When

185
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,840
did you learn to eavesdrop?

186
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,850
They were talking there.

187
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,050
What was I supposed to do? Cover my ears?

188
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,560
Save your excuses.

189
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,290
But what exactly happened
at the Huangji Platform?

190
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,270
Eight years ago,

191
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,350
at the Ritual of Grain Praying on
the first Xin Day of the lunar new year,

192
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,410
the crown prince and princess
were supposed to offer millet together.

193
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:41,810
[Benevolence and People First]

194
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,660
But unexpectedly,

195
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,460
the prepared millet

196
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,150
was swarming with red ants,

197
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,300
and the crown prince
began crying for no reason.

198
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,000
The court officials took it
as a divine omen

199
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,250
and suggested punishing the crown prince.

200
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,290
To protect the infant crown prince,

201
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,170
the empress volunteered
to go to Cheng'en Temple

202
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,500
to atone for the sin.

203
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,790
You may leave.

204
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,130
Later, the empress was worried
about the crown prince's safety,

205
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,220
so she entrusted him to Consort Shu.

206
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,150
She took the princess with her
to Cheng'en Temple.

207
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,710
[Fengyuan Hall]

208
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,220
Looks like His Majesty
accepted the princess.

209
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,990
But His Majesty is so indifferent.

210
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,790
How is the princess
supposed to live in the palace?

211
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,620
No matter what,

212
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,030
[Fengyuan Hall]

213
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,030
it's good that she's been accepted.

214
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,950
Does it sound nice?

215
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,240
It's been a long time

216
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,230
since I heard this tune.

217
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,440
Yunqing,

218
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,630
don't hurt yourself anymore.

219
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,710
Don't do anything that will

220
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,370
put yourself in danger again.

221
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,750
The empress was kind and benevolent.

222
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,070
I'm sure she would

223
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,780
wish for your safety and happiness,

224
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,610
and a life free of illness

225
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,050
and disaster.

226
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,590
I'm a bit tired.

227
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,860
I'm going back to my room first.

228
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,780
I can't believe this.

229
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,190
What's wrong again?

230
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,290
I just heard from some maids

231
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,190
the second prince and the crown prince
accidentally fell into the lake

232
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,310
when they were playing
by the Imperial Lake.

233
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,980
Consort Jin is using this incident

234
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,510
to punish the crown prince.

235
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,290
The crown prince is mischievous.

236
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,190
It's nothing unusual

237
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,420
that he makes mistakes and gets punished.

238
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,080
The one I pity is the princess.

239
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,390
She can't swim,

240
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,510
but she risked her life

241
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,570
to save her younger brother.

242
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,570
And she

243
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,620
didn't even have time to change clothes

244
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,220
before accepting punishment
for her brother.

245
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,340
If you go, it'd only make things worse.

246
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,250
You're an official.

247
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,530
You're not allowed
to enter the harem without permission.

248
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,740
If you act on impulse,

249
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,190
the entire Yue family could suffer for it.

250
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,720
You're so young,

251
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,350
yet you're so wicked.

252
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,010
My son is only three years old,

253
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,090
and you had the audacity to take him
to the Imperial Lake to play?

254
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,210
I didn't!

255
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,250
He said he wanted to see the fish,

256
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,580
so I took him there to play.

257
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,980
You're still quibbling?

258
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,060
My son has always been obedient.

259
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,990
You must have incited him to do that.

260
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,780
Today, I'm going to
punish the crown prince with 20 lashes

261
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,100
to make up for what Huan endured
in the cold water.

262
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,670
Go!

263
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,650
Beat him!

264
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,510
Princess, I haven't thanked you
for risking your life to save Huan,

265
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,510
and now you're taking advantage of that

266
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,310
to challenge my authority?

267
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,120
Shuo is still a kid.

268
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,320
Shuo and I are blood-related.

269
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,230
Punish me.

270
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,760
It's none of your business!

271
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,210
Shuo.

272
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,010
Look.

273
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,840
He doesn't appreciate it at all.

274
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,020
Such being the case,

275
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,740
continue to beat him!

276
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,490
Sister.

277
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,120
What did you call me?

278
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,500
Sister!

279
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,290
It's alright.

280
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,260
Shuo, it doesn't hurt.

281
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,660
Father,

282
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,130
you called for me?

283
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,220
Pei Ning is a good man.

284
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,350
If it weren't for him,

285
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,140
you would have made a mistake today.

286
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,640
But I really couldn't stand it.

287
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,089
The princess nearly drowned
saving the prince,

288
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,089
and then took a whipping
for the crown prince.

289
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,950
The crown prince was also beaten.

290
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,050
The army's medicine for injuries
is the best.

291
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,380
Take some to the princess
and crown prince tomorrow.

292
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,860
Thank you, Father.

293
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,500
Princess,

294
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,070
this is the medicine from the Yue family.

295
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,130
It works well for external injuries.

296
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,350
Thank you.

297
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,550
In the palace,

298
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,380
for the two of them,

299
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,340
it's like walking through thorns.

300
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,380
If they don't press forward together,

301
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,240
I'm afraid they won't make it far.

302
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,650
Princess,

303
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,390
you should also take care of yourself.

304
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,540
Eat something.

305
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,050
The princess couldn't eat chestnut cakes
when she was a kid.

306
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,460
But today, she...

307
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,230
[Prime Minister's Mansion]

308
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,300
After nearly three months
of investigation,

309
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,700
I finally got something.

310
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,420
There's a farming family surnamed Xue

311
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,620
living in the Peach Village
near Cheng'en Temple.

312
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,230
I heard they had a poor harvest

313
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,630
and were in debt,

314
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,670
so they sent their daughter

315
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,470
to Cheng'en Temple as a servant.

316
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,520
No one knows how she caught the attention

317
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,020
of the empress and the princess.

318
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,160
But later, she was brought
into the palace to serve.

319
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,200
How long did she

320
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,090
stay at Cheng'en Temple?

321
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,020
Half a year.

322
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,140
She disappeared after that big fire.

323
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,690
She didn't go home,

324
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,990
and her body has never been found.

325
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,950
As a farmer's daughter,

326
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,290
she didn't go home.

327
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,670
Where else could she have gone?

328
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,100
Maybe...

329
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,250
she died.

330
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,050
Yeah.

331
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,340
Perhaps she died.

332
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,190
Or maybe...

333
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,430
during the massacre at Cheng'en Temple,

334
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,020
a little girl
who shouldn't have been involved,

335
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,690
in a moment of panic,

336
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,160
stole something that could change her fate

337
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,560
and escaped from that place.

338
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,960
Everything will be alright.

339
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,890
I promise.

340
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,670
How long has the princess been kneeling?

341
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,020
General Yue, it's been four hours.

342
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,230
Shuo has grown taller again.

343
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,030
He's made progress in his studies too.

344
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,690
Even his teacher praised him
for his ambitions.

345
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,270
Did you see that?

346
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,020
I still see you often.

347
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,120
Are you still blaming me?

348
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,510
[Jiang]

349
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,010
Yunqing,

350
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,170
are you awake?

351
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,320
Come in.

352
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,990
I'm hungry.

353
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,870
Go wash up.

354
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,180
The meal is ready.

355
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
After breakfast,

356
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,810
I'll take you somewhere.

357
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,560
Yue Chi, I came out like this...

358
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,380
Don't worry.

359
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,790
I'm here with you.

360
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,070
No one will investigate your identity.

361
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,940
This is...

362
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,330
You'll know after you see it.

363
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,200
Here.

364
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,830
Shuo?

365
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,520
Shuo is still alive.

366
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,060
And he's grown this tall.

367
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,490
I've been keeping Yunshuo here
for the past few years.

368
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,000
The son of this old woman

369
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,730
is out doing business
with his wife and children.

370
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,730
He asked me to look after his mother.

371
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,280
Now, the old couple

372
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,500
treat Yunshuo like their own grandson.

373
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,830
He goes to school every day

374
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,660
and lacks nothing in food or clothing.

375
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,690
I also taught him martial arts
for self-defense

376
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,420
and the principles of conduct.

377
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,040
Although he's no longer a crown prince,

378
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,500
he lives without worries.

379
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,650
With you taking care of him,

380
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,300
I have nothing to worry about.

381
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,160
Yunshuo misses you very much too.

382
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,310
Yunqing,

383
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,690
everything will be alright.

384
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,190
Yue Chi,

385
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,520
thank you.

386
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,950
I want to stay by your side.

387
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,110
Is that okay?

388
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,000
Are you really willing?

389
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,140
Now,

390
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,290
both you and Shuo

391
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,400
are safe and sound.

392
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,580
I suddenly found

393
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,370
I don't resent Huo Jingheng that much.

394
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,570
You said he's a ruler worth following.

395
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,910
I want to see if that's true.

396
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,960
You've done so much for me and Shuo.

397
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,890
I want to stay by your side.

398
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,310
Just let me be your guard.

399
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,520
Is that okay?

400
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,830
How could I let you do such hard work?

401
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,400
Besides,

402
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,820
your identity is special.

403
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,330
You should stay in the mansion.

404
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,360
As long as you and Yunshuo are safe,

405
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,800
I have nothing more to ask for.

406
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,580
[Jiang]

407
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,290
You motherless child,

408
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,410
we won't play with you.

409
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,470
That's right. We won't play with you.

410
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,920
Let's go.

411
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,950
It's no big deal.

412
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,500
You're a child without a mother.

413
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,940
I'm a child without a father.

414
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,230
You can get up yourself.

415
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,250
I succeeded.
And it's okay even if no one wants us.

416
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,920
Do you miss home?

417
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,980
I'll sing a song for you.

418
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,660
Mm.

419
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,490
Come.

420
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,770
[Yongqian Palace]

421
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,230
Your Majesty, please calm down.

422
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,790
No.

423
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,760
I can't be troubled alone.

424
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,910
Yue Chi!

425
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,490
Yue Chi.

426
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,970
You have a guest?

427
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:09,910
Yes.

428
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,480
She's an old friend of mine.

429
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,940
She passed through the capital
and came to see me.

430
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,950
We're having a meal.

431
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,870
Why don't you...

432
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,870
I'll help myself.

433
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,630
Please give me a bowl
and a pair of chopsticks.

434
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,910
Okay.

435
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,660
Right,

436
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,810
didn't you say you wanted to try
the capital's specialties?

437
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,020
I'll ask Uncle Liu to go with you.

438
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,580
Uncle Liu,
take her to Zuixiang Restaurant.

439
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,060
Their dishes are the most distinctive.

440
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,700
Okay.

441
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,450
Thank you.

442
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,010
Sir, enjoy your meal.

443
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,080
Miss, why don't you come with me?

444
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,590
Maybe another day.
The dishes have been made.

445
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,620
It would be a shame to waste them.

446
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,980
Make yourself at home.

447
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,720
Jing,

448
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,120
why did you come suddenly?

449
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,730
Is there something urgent?

450
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,950
The censors are impeaching someone again.

451
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,060
They accused

452
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,330
the Minister of Works

453
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,940
of misconduct.

454
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,490
They reported 38 wrongdoings.

455
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,810
But from what I've seen,

456
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,380
the Minister of Works
seems like an honest man.

457
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,240
So I came to discuss with you.

458
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,440
Should we report this to His Majesty?

459
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,420
Yue,

460
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,560
is your guest a person of noble status?

461
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,980
How did you know that?

462
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,390
Is there anything special about me?

463
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,620
The official titles you just mentioned,

464
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,040
like Assistant Minister and Minister—

465
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,470
I know them.

466
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,980
And you're discussing
such matters with Yue.

467
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,740
If you're not of noble status,

468
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,480
are the street hawkers the noble ones?

469
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,580
Jing,

470
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,760
let's discuss these matters in the study.

471
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,110
No need to make

472
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,630
a spectacle in front of the lady.

473
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,760
It's alright.

474
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,580
I noticed he barely touched the dishes.

475
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,570
He must be unsatisfied with the dishes.

476
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,450
Uncle Liu,

477
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,450
why don't you ask the kitchen
to prepare more dishes?

478
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,460
Then they can talk while eating.

479
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,890
Miss, what would you like to add?

480
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,430
Add

481
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,080
Golden and Silver Crabs.

482
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,300
Miss,

483
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,390
I've never heard of this dish.

484
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,700
It's simple. First, steam the crabs.

485
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,860
Then extract the meat and roe.

486
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,290
Mix them into the dough,

487
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,430
cut into short rolls,

488
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,880
and steam them again.

489
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,060
The snowy white crab meat

490
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,370
and the golden, translucent roe—

491
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,860
hence the name, Golden and Silver Crabs.

492
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,340
My family used to love this dish.

493
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,050
Then add...

494
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,710
Goose Lips.

495
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,330
Take dozens of goose lips.

496
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,640
Rinse them in yellow wine.

497
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,200
Then marinate them with seasoning.

498
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,980
How about this?

499
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,740
Uncle Liu, grab a pen and paper.

500
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,540
I'll write down the ingredients for you.

501
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,500
Okay.

502
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,690
Such extravagance

503
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,410
reminds me of Former Ning.

504
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,110
Sit down and eat.

505
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,240
Don't waste them.

506
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:22,900
Sit.

507
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:25,740
Sit.

508
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,560
Eat.

509
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,580
The game is intense. Gentlemen,

510
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,790
have some tea.

511
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,080
Aren't you friends with Yue?

512
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,220
Why are you doing the work of a servant?

513
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,230
Yeah.

514
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,320
It makes it seem like I'm mistreating you.

515
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,280
It's late.

516
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,590
Go back and rest.

517
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,610
Mr. Jing, your playing style
is aggressive.

518
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,670
You press forward with every move.

519
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,570
But you charge ahead
without guarding your rear.

520
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,120
I thought you didn't know
how to play chess.

521
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,420
Once the two armies clash,

522
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,150
your rear is wide open—

523
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,760
ripe for ambush.

524
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,410
That would let

525
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,880
someone unremarkable gain the upper hand.

526
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,290
Onlookers shouldn't speak.

527
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,020
You should go back to your room.

528
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,520
She knows nothing about this.

529
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,000
What she said is just nonsense.

530
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Let's continue.

531
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,090
Continue.

532
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,810
Who is she?

533
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:11,370
[Prince Anle's Mansion]

534
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,480
[Jiang]

535
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,330
This pattern...

536
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,810
looks so familiar.

537
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,830
[Ceremonial Totems
of the Azure Tiger and White Dragon]

538
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,810
[Jiang]

539
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,830
As I thought,

540
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,010
she is
the highly favored Princess Changping.

541
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,280
No wonder Yue Chi saved her many times.

542
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,850
Your Majesty,

543
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,510
Prime Minister Yue and she were betrothed.

544
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,530
Taking her in is understandable.

545
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,550
But he lied to you.

546
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,930
I wonder

547
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,570
how you'll deal with him.

548
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,010
What's wrong?

549
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,970
Yunqing, where's your jade pendant?

550
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:07,970
The jade pendant?

551
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,450
It's gone.

552
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,220
During today's meeting,

553
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,690
I saw a jade imprint on the imperial desk.

554
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,990
It's identical to yours.

555
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,250
How could this happen?

556
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,520
I really don't know.

557
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,230
Forget it.

558
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,930
You've appeared far too often.

559
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,580
I fear His Majesty might remember you

560
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
and begin to suspect your identity.

561
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,670
What do you think we should do?

562
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:33,460
Yunqing,

563
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,370
I'll get you out of the city first.

564
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,070
Shuang!

565
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,750
Help Miss Jiang pack her things.

566
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,080
Take good care of Miss Jiang.

567
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,350
Stay with her.

568
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,770
No need to rush back to me.

569
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,290
I stay with her?

570
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,840
Do as I said.

571
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,210
Go ready the horses.

572
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,880
Prime Minister Yue,

573
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,830
His Majesty summoned you to the palace

574
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,490
to discuss something urgent.

575
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,620
Give it back to her.

576
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,860
I was worried
it would cause gossip in the court.

577
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:26,989
That's why I concealed

578
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,050
her identity.

579
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,679
I have no ill intentions.

580
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,000
I know.

581
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,250
I'm just angry.

582
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,219
You think I'm so petty that I'd kill her

583
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,020
just because she's from

584
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,440
the former royal family?

585
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:40,960
I...

586
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,860
am not sure.

587
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,670
Whether I would kill her or not—

588
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,840
let's put that aside for now.

589
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,219
But I believe you and I

590
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,010
share the same thought on one thing.

591
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:56,620
If the court officials knew

592
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,250
that you've been hiding her,

593
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,310
you would either lose your position

594
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,780
or end up in jail.

595
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,880
I will not let her be discovered.

596
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,760
Besides,

597
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,790
even if I have to resign,

598
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,330
I could still assist you

599
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,660
from behind the scenes.

600
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,540
I'm worried you might suffer.

601
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,670
Listen to me.

602
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,640
Let me deal with her.

603
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,930
I'll ask someone

604
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,360
to escort her safely out of the capital.

605
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,130
And I'll arrange a safe place
for her to stay.

606
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,870
You can visit her anytime.

607
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,720
I was planning to get her
out of the capital today.

608
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,010
You don't need to worry about it.

609
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,490
Years ago,

610
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,480
she disappeared mysteriously.

611
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,680
Now she's mysteriously appeared
in the capital.

612
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,200
I'm worried she might be used

613
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,890
by someone with ulterior motives.

614
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,020
It might harm you if she stays with you.

615
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,330
Thank you for worrying about me.

616
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,490
I'll get her out as soon as possible.

617
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,460
I won't disappoint you.

618
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,480
After all this talk,

619
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,750
you still think I'd kill her, right?

620
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,050
I never meant that.

621
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,320
Forget it.

622
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,860
She must leave

623
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,440
within two days.

624
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,420
The farther, the better.

625
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,720
Yes.

626
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,900
Get Miss Jiang out of the city now.

627
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,020
There should be no delay.

628
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,750
Commander,

629
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,800
as soon as you were summoned
to the palace,

630
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,620
Miss Jiang locked herself in her room

631
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,680
and wouldn't come out no matter what.

632
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:33,970
It's been a day,

633
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,700
and she hasn't eaten anything.

634
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,300
She won't even listen to you?

635
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,150
Your legs aren't well.

636
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,380
Don't keep standing.

637
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,910
You've gone too far.

638
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,460
Uncle Liu is old.

639
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,680
His legs aren't well,

640
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,010
yet you made him
stand at the door all day.

641
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,110
Come out.

642
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,800
I have something to tell you.

643
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,910
No need to say anything.

644
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,260
I'm telling you—

645
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,370
I won't leave.

646
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,120
His Majesty is truly angry this time.

647
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,750
If you don't leave now,

648
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,140
I fear I won't be able to protect you.

649
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,640
No need.

650
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,010
At worst, we'll fight to the bitter end.

651
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,750
At least that way,

652
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,720
he won't take it out on you instead.

653
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,820
He won't take your life.

654
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,820
I'm just worried he'll imprison you,

655
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,990
and you'll suffer.

656
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,070
You know this.

657
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,460
Yunshuo and I have been apart
for so many years.

658
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,690
I don't want to leave him again.

659
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,600
I promise you

660
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,060
this is only temporary.

661
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,120
Once all this is over,

662
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,500
I'll personally bring you back

663
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,530
and let you reunite with Yunshuo.

664
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,010
Okay?

665
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,880
If I leave,

666
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,470
what about you and Ling'er?

667
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,500
This started because of me.

668
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,210
How can I leave alone?

669
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,320
Commander, why don't we just tie her up
and take her away?

670
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,090
No.

671
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,460
We still have two days.

672
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,450
Tomorrow, go deliver a message to Ling'er.

673
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,340
Ask her to come and persuade her.

674
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:18,960
Tell her to say
she's going home to visit family.

675
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,150
Remember,

676
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,320
do it secretly.

677
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,820
Got it.
