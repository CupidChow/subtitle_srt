00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,940
[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,920
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,760
Your Highness,

4
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,960
just cut to the point.

5
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,180
Yue Chi,

6
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,570
I want you to come with me to Li State

7
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,039
and be the prime minister of Li State.

8
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,620
You must be joking.

9
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,030
I am a citizen of Ning State.

10
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,210
How can I be an official in Li State?

11
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,780
In ancient times, Zhang Yi of Wei

12
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,260
traversed the courts
of Chu, Zhao, and Qin,

13
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,650
and achieved great renown.

14
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,180
Your talent surpasses his.

15
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,210
Why not follow suit?

16
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,090
But Zhang Yi eventually

17
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,420
returned to his homeland.

18
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,060
That was because

19
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,289
he fell out with King Wu of Qin

20
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:40,620
and found favor with the ruler of Wei.

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,020
It was a means to survive.

22
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,789
Your Highness, can you guarantee

23
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,520
future emperors of Li State

24
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,420
won't treat me

25
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,580
as King Wu

26
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,810
treated Zhang Yi?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,810
I can't foresee

28
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,930
the future.

29
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:54,940
I also understand the saying,

30
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,200
"A new sovereign brings new ministers."

31
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:58,780
Yue Chi,

32
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,090
you and Huo Jingheng

33
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,650
once met blade to blade.

34
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,290
Two men with different starting points—

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,040
even if they share a common destination,

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,520
they can easily part ways.

37
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,380
Huo Jingheng is no longer

38
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,380
the wandering swordsman he once was.

39
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,170
He needs your assistance now,

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,820
so he can tolerate your presence.

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,890
But in the future?

42
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,170
Prime Minister Yue,

43
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,010
I'm sure you've also thought

44
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,270
about what I just said.

45
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,300
With so many old grievances,

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,480
your relationship with Huo Jingheng

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
can never

48
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,890
be truly solid.

49
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,150
Isn't your current allegiance

50
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,140
a form of retreat?

51
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,220
And when you can retreat no further,

52
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,050
what will you do?

53
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,579
Prime Minister Yue,

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,840
the ideals you strive for

55
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,850
are the very ones I seek.

56
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,640
Let's realize them together

57
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,760
in Li State.

58
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,540
If you're still worried,

59
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,180
I promise you

60
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,660
once I ascend the throne,

61
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,110
I will issue a secret edict—

62
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,770
the Vermilion-inscribed Iron Charter—

63
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,380
to protect you all your life.

64
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,770
What befell Zhang Yi in his final days

65
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,840
will never happen

66
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,310
to you.

67
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,670
Prime Minister Yue,

68
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,980
think about it.

69
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,270
I await your answer.

70
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,010
I'm unwell,

71
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,250
so I'm leaving first.

72
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,480
Commander,

73
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,579
do you believe him?

74
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,220
Of course not.

75
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,000
Your Majesty.

76
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,380
I was in the next room

77
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,280
and heard

78
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,030
the crown prince talking to someone.

79
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,850
So I came to see

80
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,420
which lady it was.

81
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,040
I didn't expect it to be you,
Prime Minister Yue.

82
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,870
Yi Qingyun is so cunning.

83
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,860
He sent someone to buy

84
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,790
from specific shops in the palace,

85
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,660
saying someone at Zuixiang Restaurant

86
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,770
is staging a play that tarnishes my name.

87
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,640
Looks like

88
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,820
his true intention lies elsewhere.

89
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,410
You're quite valuable,

90
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,130
Yue Chi.

91
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,540
Come.

92
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,490
Let's drink. Don't waste it.

93
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,730
His Majesty is displeased.

94
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,540
The prime minister's going to be punished.

95
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,940
What kind of punishment?

96
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,580
That depends on His Majesty.

97
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,860
People only get upset

98
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,750
with those they care about.

99
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,360
Your Majesty.

100
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,420
Don't.

101
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,540
Don't say anything. Just drink.

102
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,810
Wei Zhang.

103
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,410
Your Majesty, you're awake.

104
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,100
Where am I?

105
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,130
What time is it?

106
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,540
This is Prince Anle's Mansion.

107
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,610
It's already late,

108
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,960
but today is a day off.

109
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,260
The wine was strong yesterday.

110
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,900
You got drunk after just a few cups.

111
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,930
Prime Minister Yue and I

112
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,490
escorted you here to rest.

113
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,570
The imperial carriage is waiting outside.

114
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,190
And lunch has been prepared here.

115
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,230
Your Majesty, would you like to dine here

116
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,090
or return directly to the palace?

117
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,590
Serve the meal.

118
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,659
We'll leave after eating.

119
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,170
Yes.

120
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,960
Sun Tzu said

121
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,210
the art of war

122
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,220
is of vital importance to the state.

123
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,800
It is a matter of life and death,

124
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,659
a road either to safety or to ruin.

125
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,420
Hence it is a subject of inquiry
which can on no account be neglected.

126
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,340
Alright.

127
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:01,970
Shuo,

128
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,260
have some water and take a break.

129
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,290
We're just getting started.

130
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,520
Shuo is amazing.

131
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,350
Right?

132
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,750
Look at them—

133
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,290
what a harmonious family.

134
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,690
Once upon a time,

135
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,290
I had

136
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,580
moments like that too.

137
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:18,990
What?

138
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:19,810
Their betrothal

139
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,840
has long been nullified.

140
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,170
You are the real family.

141
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,130
Home is

142
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,470
where the heart is.

143
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,250
I've lost my appetite.

144
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,450
Go back to the palace.

145
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,020
Your Majesty, you're leaving?

146
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,550
I'll go tell Commander now.

147
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,290
No need.

148
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,290
I have things to handle in the palace.
Let's go.

149
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,370
Shuo is the best.

150
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,890
Tomorrow,

151
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,240
revise it yourself.

152
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,220
Why have you come to pick me up?

153
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,350
Is something wrong?

154
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,930
Look who's talking.

155
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,370
This morning, the ministers

156
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,340
couldn't find you anywhere.

157
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,270
They all came to me and Her Majesty!

158
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,730
Today is a day off.

159
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,420
What annoying thing

160
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,350
did they report?

161
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,110
There really is something wrong.

162
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,840
Something happened in Qi City.

163
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,310
[Yongqian Palace]

164
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,810
How come he has no appetite at all?

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,049
He was just stopped by a few ministers.

166
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,970
And just now, he...

167
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,230
Got it?

168
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,330
I see.

169
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,820
Rise.

170
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,630
I heard

171
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,650
you haven't eaten anything for half a day,

172
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,410
so I specially brought
some new dishes from the kitchen

173
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,340
for you to try.

174
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,740
I ate too much yesterday.

175
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,040
I have no appetite.

176
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,430
You have no appetite

177
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,490
or you're not in the mood?

178
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,750
Consort Yue, mind your words.

179
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,870
Yes.

180
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,460
I'm clumsy with words.

181
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,410
I misspoke.

182
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm not like my brother.

183
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,720
He's so thoughtful

184
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,350
and considerate.

185
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,430
When my brother

186
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,990
was Consort Yue,

187
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,610
you were far more at ease than now.

188
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,680
If only he were by your side.

189
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,890
Right?

190
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,750
Why don't you...

191
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,010
Why don't you summon my brother here

192
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,070
to be Consort Yue again for a few days?

193
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,520
He's reunited

194
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,800
with an old acquaintance,

195
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,190
and there's someone
in his mansion he cares about.

196
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,030
I'm afraid he has no time to spare for me.

197
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,340
That's not true.

198
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,030
The things you handle are about the state.

199
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,980
They are important.

200
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,560
My brother's a workhorse.

201
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,490
He won't slack off.

202
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,530
Then why isn't he here

203
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,260
to discuss important matters?

204
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,900
Your Majesty,

205
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,610
Prime Minister Yue

206
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,220
is discussing matters with some officials

207
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,080
from the Ministry of War
and the Ministry of Revenue.

208
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,410
Shall I summon him here?

209
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,700
Look,

210
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,490
I was right, wasn't I?

211
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,080
My brother's presence

212
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,490
has greatly improved your appetite.

213
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,500
He's more effective than the physicians

214
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,690
and medicine.

215
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,340
Let him wait.

216
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,090
I want to eat first.

217
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,130
Yes.

218
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,960
Wait.

219
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Tell

220
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,600
Minister Du

221
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,970
and Yue Chi to handle this.

222
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,570
Ask

223
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,990
the Ministries of Revenue, War, and Works

224
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,340
to fully cooperate with them.

225
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,010
Yes.

226
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,180
Just two dishes?

227
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,180
Yeah.

228
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,460
I just told you I brought new dishes.

229
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,420
I brought them for you to try first.

230
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,740
[Prince Anle's Mansion]

231
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,850
I thought you went to discuss matters.

232
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,300
Qi City is in the rainy season,

233
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,370
but the dam was blown up and collapsed.

234
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,700
Now the flooding is severe,

235
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,990
and disease is beginning to spread.

236
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,780
His Majesty has ordered us

237
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,690
to dispatch a team to escort

238
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,520
the grain transport from the capital.

239
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,250
They must arrive
before the epidemic takes hold.

240
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,100
The Ministry of Works

241
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,220
will send people to repair the dam.

242
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,280
We need to send people to escort them.

243
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,580
Also,

244
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,860
choose a few men from the Qilin Army.

245
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,730
Have them go secretly

246
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,820
to investigate who had the audacity

247
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,780
to do that.

248
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,950
If they make another move,

249
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,650
you can kill first and report later.

250
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,340
Yes.

251
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,110
What's wrong?

252
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,110
Just say it.

253
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,020
The crown prince of Li State is here.

254
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,230
Again?

255
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,370
Prime Minister Yue,
your taste in aesthetics...

256
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,570
is certainly humble.

257
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,370
Your Highness,

258
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,440
you came uninvited.

259
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,370
What?

260
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,260
You fear what people might say?

261
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,310
That was coincidental.

262
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,010
I met His Majesty at that place

263
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,730
and that time.

264
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,170
It wasn't a coincidence.

265
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,110
It was my careful planning.

266
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,300
Have you thought about

267
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,280
what I proposed that day?

268
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,730
I refuse.

269
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,120
You are not sincere.

270
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,630
You almost dragged me
into a charge of treason.

271
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,490
If His Majesty had taken offense,

272
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,310
would you have had a way to protect me?

273
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,850
The King of Ning wouldn't.

274
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,240
Your Highness,

275
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,770
why must it be me?

276
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,900
Prime Minister Yue,

277
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,980
you are brave and battle-tested.

278
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,340
The military strategies
you wrote in your childhood

279
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,580
helped Ning State take
ten of Li State's prefectures.

280
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,770
So naturally,

281
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,250
you can help me win them back.

282
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,860
Ning took ten prefectures of Li State.

283
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,250
It's already history.

284
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,370
So that is what this sickly fox

285
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,210
has always wanted.

286
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,060
Losing ten prefectures of Li State

287
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,410
have always been a thorn
in my father's heart.

288
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,520
Now my father is bedridden,

289
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,100
with not much time left.

290
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,010
I just want to help him

291
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,820
fulfill his last wish.

292
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,930
If I remember correctly,

293
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,790
the King of Li lost three sons

294
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,820
within a year.

295
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,610
That's why he suddenly fell ill.

296
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,540
Rumor has it

297
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,020
that it was all your doing.

298
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,260
Your filial piety comes and goes

299
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,500
quite selectively.

300
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,350
Or...

301
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,750
you're only responsible

302
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,280
for handling his last wish?

303
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,580
I just want to restore Li State

304
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,940
to peace and prosperity.

305
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,980
It's a pity

306
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,710
that my brothers were incompetent.

307
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,820
Only I can do it.

308
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,180
My father is old.

309
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,820
He doesn't understand.

310
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,820
He even sent me to Ning.

311
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,020
I stayed in Former Ning for five years.

312
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,110
Fortunately, heaven blessed Li.

313
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,730
Thanks to my careful planning,

314
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,530
I finally returned to Li safely.

315
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,840
Of course I should reorganize the court.

316
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,370
You're speaking too freely.

317
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,290
I don't care about Li's affairs.

318
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,550
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.

319
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,900
If you are willing

320
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,250
to work for me,

321
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,900
I'll be willing to tell you all my plans.

322
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,140
No need.

323
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:46,770
I still have

324
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,770
important matters to handle today.

325
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,220
Your Highness, please go back.

326
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,370
Okay.

327
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,730
I'm not someone

328
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,190
who likes to force others.

329
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,770
Prime Minister Yue,
if you change your mind,

330
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,060
I will be waiting.

331
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,100
What bad luck.

332
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:17,940
Shuo?

333
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,010
Yue,

334
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,300
this friend of yours—

335
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,130
I don't like him.

336
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:21,770
Shuo.

337
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,200
Do you know who that person is?

338
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,340
You know him?

339
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,060
He looked cold and sharp,

340
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,370
harboring murderous intent.

341
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,070
I guess

342
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,700
he's not an ordinary person.

343
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,650
Sister,

344
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,130
I don't like this person.

345
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,580
He's full of hostility.

346
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,980
From what Yue just said,

347
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,530
he murdered his own brothers

348
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,130
and harbors resentment towards his father.

349
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,360
That is unfilial.

350
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,010
He disregards the current peace

351
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,370
and wants to start a war.

352
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,730
That is unrighteous.

353
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,610
He talked of ambitions for prosperity,

354
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,080
but he doesn't understand that as a ruler,

355
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,890
he should prioritize

356
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,110
the will of the people.

357
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,580
That makes him not benevolent.

358
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,010
If he becomes the ruler of Li State,

359
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,220
the people of Li State

360
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,540
will have no good days.

361
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,700
Shuo,

362
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,580
you've grown up.

363
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,150
All those years studying with your tutor
weren't in vain.

364
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,460
The one who taught me the most

365
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,460
wasn't the tutor.

366
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,250
It was you, Yue.

367
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
You two—

368
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,860
one is wise, and the other is brave.

369
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,390
You complement each other.

370
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,650
I found this letter in the medicine pouch

371
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,090
sent by Man King's men.

372
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,710
[Everything's going smoothly in Qi City]

373
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,860
I didn't expect Man King from the wilds

374
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,100
to be so adept

375
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,130
at causing trouble.

376
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,380
But he's celebrating too soon.

377
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,250
The real show has just begun.

378
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,060
Yue Chi has already

379
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,890
sent people today

380
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,550
to transport grain to Qi City.

381
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,580
From the capital to Qi City,

382
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,920
the Qinghu Mountain
is the only way through.

383
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,490
That means

384
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,280
Man King has something to do again.

385
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,650
You should drink the medicine first

386
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,380
before you handle the affairs.

387
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,210
Okay.

388
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,810
From Shuo's abduction
to the dam's explosion,

389
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,339
everything happened
around the time of Yi Qingyun's visit.

390
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,369
Could all of this
have something to do with Yi Qingyun?

391
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,030
I just want to restore Li State

392
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,900
to the peace and prosperity
it knew a century ago.

393
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,270
If that's the case,

394
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,890
what's his next move?

395
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,060
Commander.

396
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,740
What I just told you...

397
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,070
I've passed your order.

398
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,900
Good.

399
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,260
A storm is brewing.

400
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,690
Fellow villagers,

401
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,770
no pushing!

402
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,020
[General's Mansion]

403
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,680
There's enough for everyone!

404
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:02,970
General!

405
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,610
General, bad news.

406
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,260
The grain convoy from the north
just sent a message.

407
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,170
Our men were rushing through the night,

408
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,300
and when they passed
through the Qinghu Mountain,

409
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,780
a gang of bandits

410
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,060
suddenly ambushed them from the ravine.

411
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,650
They had a fierce fight with our men.

412
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,550
During the fight,

413
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,340
someone's torch

414
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,450
set fire to the grain carts.

415
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,060
Everything was burned to ash.

416
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,340
Our men are still recovering.

417
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,130
The capital will have to

418
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,330
send another convoy.

419
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,940
Instead of robbing silver and gold,
they burned the grain.

420
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,740
No bandits would do such a thing.

421
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,730
General!

422
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,160
Someone is deliberately causing trouble.

423
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,350
General,

424
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,090
our courtyard is truly overcrowded.

425
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,870
Someone in the front yard
is having a fever.

426
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,560
The rice bins in the mansion
are almost empty.

427
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,520
If this continues,

428
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,200
none of us will survive.

429
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,020
I've got an idea.

430
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,260
[Fengyuan Hall]

431
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,060
Your Majesty,

432
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,410
I have something to report.

433
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,330
Man King, Cao Mang,

434
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,740
entered the capital without summons.

435
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,970
That's disrespectful.

436
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,890
And he deliberately

437
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,930
destroyed the dam,

438
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,780
causing the disastrous floods in Qi City.

439
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,690
The grain convoy

440
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,260
was stopped outside the city.

441
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,860
It must be his doing too.

442
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,230
This man harbors malicious intentions.

443
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,650
Your Majesty, please punish him.

444
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,370
I am already aware of this matter.

445
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,590
But now,

446
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,980
Qi City is filled with starving people.

447
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,430
Our top priority

448
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,760
is to resolve the flood crisis.

449
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,800
Once Qi City is stabilized,

450
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,820
I'll send people to arrest Cao Mang.

451
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,620
Your Majesty,

452
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,990
I want to impeach General Zhennan.

453
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,010
A few days ago,

454
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,690
he opened the military granary
without permission

455
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,610
and distributed grain

456
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,440
to the refugees and civilians.

457
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,500
He's entered the capital to plead guilty.

458
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,160
He's right here in the capital.

459
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,620
This...

460
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,140
This is ridiculous.

461
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,060
Yeah.

462
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,780
If Li State were to invade now,

463
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,350
how could we fend them off?

464
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,110
Does General Zhennan

465
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,930
have any respect for law?

466
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,100
Your Majesty,

467
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,400
since General Zhennan

468
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,300
had the audacity to open
the military granary without permission,

469
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,570
he might rise in rebellion one day.

470
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,460
This man

471
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,240
disregards court rules.

472
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,220
He might be the next Cao Mang.

473
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,130
Your Majesty, please sentence him to death

474
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,610
to eliminate this hidden threat

475
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,070
and set an example for all.

476
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,650
-Please sentence General Zhennan to death.
-Please sentence General Zhennan to death.

477
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,030
What you said is not right.

478
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,300
General Zhennan

479
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,340
broke the law knowingly for Qi City's

480
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,690
refugees and civilians.

481
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,320
If I sentence him to death,

482
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,760
I'd disappoint good officials

483
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,010
who truly care about the people

484
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,680
and those people

485
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,410
he helped.

486
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,100
Your Majesty,

487
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,480
though you are newly enthroned,

488
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,940
the laws of the old dynasty

489
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,170
have been inherited until now

490
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,370
for good reasons.

491
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,480
Please do not

492
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,420
act on impulse.

493
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,410
I am not a naughty child!

494
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,580
Why do you think I'm acting on impulse?

495
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,860
I have made my decision!

496
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,170
There's no need for further discussion!

497
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,100
Pass my order.

498
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,970
General Zhennan will be fined
three years of salary

499
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,410
to replenish the treasury.

500
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,410
Court dismissed!

501
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,860
Court dismissed!

502
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,390
-Respectfully seeing Your Majesty off.
-Respectfully seeing Your Majesty off.

503
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,720
Those pretentious old men.

504
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,130
They're the ones who insist the harem
shouldn't meddle in state affairs.

505
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,100
They're also the ones

506
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,860
who have bypassed the emperor

507
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,100
and sent these memorials to me.

508
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,060
Go.

509
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,610
Send these memorials

510
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,390
back to them.

511
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,220
Who are they

512
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,020
to tell my son

513
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,060
what to do?

514
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,530
They might as well

515
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,670
have the Huo family step down!

516
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,750
Your Grace,

517
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,060
you're right.

518
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,770
But...

519
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,930
Your Grace,

520
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,180
I heard

521
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,180
His Majesty's pardon of General Zhennan

522
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,760
didn't just displease those old officials.

523
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,370
Distributing military grain to civilians

524
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,100
has been a forbidden act

525
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,820
for centuries.

526
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,010
If His Majesty

527
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,580
truly intends

528
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,690
to go against the entire court,

529
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,160
I'm afraid he

530
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,370
will face some hardships.

531
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,780
So,

532
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,190
I need to find him someone

533
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,000
who can help him and understand him soon.

534
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,300
You're here.

535
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,610
During yesterday's court session,

536
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,010
you didn't say anything.

537
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,370
And you didn't kneel with the others

538
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,650
to pressure me.

539
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,740
I thank you for that.

540
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,840
What are you doing?

541
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,260
I'm guilty.

542
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,110
Without your permission,

543
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,740
I sent someone to put

544
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,890
General Zhennan in prison in your name.

545
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,820
Yue Chi!

546
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,260
This is a crime of deceiving the emperor!

547
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,450
Do you want to die?

548
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,770
I knew you would be angry.

549
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,500
I did that with the determination

550
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,740
to die.

551
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,170
I couldn't stand by
and watch you make a mistake.

552
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,340
General Zhennan

553
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,850
saved the people of Qi City

554
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,050
in their time of need.

555
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,540
That was an act of benevolence

556
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,400
and a good deed!

557
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,580
I've ordered him to repay the grain loss.

558
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,540
Why can't you all

559
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,700
let him go?

560
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:17,860
Yue Chi,

561
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,340
I thought you understood me.

562
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,570
You're right.

563
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,740
But General Zhennan gets his salary

564
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,740
from the state.

565
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,410
Qi City is under Ning's rule.

566
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,610
You sit on the throne,

567
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,260
so you should see beyond

568
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,450
General Zhennan's benevolence

569
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,850
and Qi City's suffering.

570
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,190
You should think for the entire Ning.

571
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,430
Military grain is crucial

00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
Sir.

758
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,930
You seem to be living comfortably

759
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,970
in the Prime Minister's Mansion.

760
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,190
No.

761
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,820
I'm just pretending
to get along with Yue Chi

762
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,710
to gather information.

763
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,750
Actually,

764
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,110
we severed all ties long ago.

765
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,230
Then tell me,

766
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,600
what information have you gathered?

767
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,020
The carriage escorting General Zhennan

768
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,370
already entered the imperial prison.

769
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,560
But for some reason,

770
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,260
the emperor's imperial guards

771
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,260
took him away.

772
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,200
That's all I was able to find out.

773
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,920
I'll take you home.

774
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,560
I still have no strength.

775
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,159
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

776
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,330
[General Zhennan has been pardoned
and left the city]

777
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:56,219
This...

778
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,230
Ready the horse now!

779
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:58,740
Hurry!

780
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,020
Prepare my carriage!

781
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,430
Sister.

782
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,080
Shuo.

783
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,110
Go get a doctor for Yunqing.

784
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,740
I have something urgent to handle.
I'm leaving.

785
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,340
Yes.

786
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,040
What are you doing?

787
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,340
Your Majesty,

788
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,790
I beg you

789
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,790
to execute General Zhennan

790
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,470
to uphold the law!

791
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,340
[Zuoshun Gate]

792
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,530
-Please execute General Zhennan
-Please execute General Zhennan

793
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,450
-to uphold the law!
-to uphold the law!

794
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,970
I am the emperor!

795
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:41,850
Are you trying

796
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,470
to tell me what to do?

797
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,750
Yes.

798
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,220
You are the emperor.

799
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,020
All I can do

800
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,890
is kneeling here

801
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,640
and begging you to reconsider.

802
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,420
General Zhennan distributed military grain
without permission.

803
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,060
Everyone knows that now.

804
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,050
If you insist

805
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,280
on escorting him

806
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,760
out of the capital,

807
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,070
let this carriage

808
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,100
run me over.

809
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,370
I'll have

810
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,300
no complaint.

811
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,140
Very well.

812
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,480
You're threatening me like this.

813
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,740
You think I won't do that, huh?

814
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,050
I wouldn't dare.

815
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,520
I wouldn't dare.

816
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,540
-I wouldn't dare.
-I wouldn't dare.

817
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,010
Your Majesty.

818
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,810
After the grain was robbed,

819
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,170
I opened

820
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,410
the military granary without permission.

821
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,220
I understand.

822
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,740
You had no other choice.

823
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,640
I made a mistake knowingly.

824
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,790
I defied the law and military discipline.

825
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,870
I

826
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,060
beg you to punish me.

827
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,620
I came here to protect you.

828
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,470
Your Majesty,

829
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,680
opening the military granary
without permission

830
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,100
has always been

831
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,700
a capital offense throughout history.

832
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,860
When I opened the military granary,

833
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,010
I knew exactly what would follow.

834
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,830
Military grain functions
as contingency rations.

835
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,450
You saved the lives of the people.

836
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,180
If I kill you today,

837
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:29,930
in the future,

838
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:30,740
would there be

839
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,140
another official in Ning

840
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,570
willing to risk his life for the people?

841
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,300
Once a war begins,

842
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,920
how many more will die?

843
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,650
Shut up!

844
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,610
General!

845
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,820
-General!
-General!
