[Episode 24]

3
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,480
[Fengming Town]

4
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,920
After days of fierce battle,

5
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
the Northwest Army led by General Du

6
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,850
was outnumbered

7
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,900
and forced to retreat into Mount Fengming.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,360
Just tell me.

9
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,680
How many days do I have left?

10
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,160
Well...

11
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,520
At most...

12
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,720
one month.

13
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,360
Doctor,

14
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,479
think again.

15
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,360
Forget it.

16
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,570
There's no use pressuring him.

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,000
You may leave.

18
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,039
Yes.

19
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:49,759
My Lord,

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,560
don't believe this quack.

21
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,940
I came to terms
with life and death long ago.

22
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,680
I just didn't expect

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,800
that day to come so soon.

24
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,920
Shadow,

25
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,550
do you think we should

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,280
still fight this war?

27
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,310
My Lord, what makes you say that?

28
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,280
Whether we win or lose,

29
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,080
once war breaks out,

30
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,760
the land will be scorched,

31
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,600
and everything will be ruined.

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,120
And with my time coming to an end,

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,850
I won't be able to assist Yi Xin.

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,920
Yi Xin is still young.

35
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,160
Even if he ascends the throne,

36
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,600
how will he face

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,480
such a broken world?

38
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,200
Will he truly be able

39
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,950
to firmly hold the reins of power?

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,120
But now that things have come this far,

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,520
do we still have a way out?

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Shadow is right.

43
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,480
Your Highness,

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,340
do you still have a way out?

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,020
I wonder what Huo Jingheng

46
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,880
did to bewitch you.

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,000
Since you came out last time,

48
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,230
you've been hesitant,

49
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,560
wavering in every move.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,120
But no matter what,

51
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,440
Your Highness,

52
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,260
please don't hesitate anymore.

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,520
Yi Xin is already in my hands.

54
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,890
If you won't help me

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,760
and let Li's army obey my orders,

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,920
I'll kill him in front of you.

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,320
By that time,

58
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,640
you won't need to worry

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,160
whether he can firmly hold

60
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,600
the reins of power or not.

61
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,870
Xue Jingguan.

62
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,329
My Lord.

63
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,320
Shadow.

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,880
The flute.

65
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,400
Bring it to me.

66
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,900
I'm going to kill her.

67
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,640
Yes.

68
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,560
Your Highness.

69
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,320
Are you looking for this?

70
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,820
Go ahead and pick one.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,200
Pick any one you like.

72
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,560
I took poison and I've lost my senses.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,060
You can play the flute until it breaks

74
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,520
and let me die here.

75
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,440
As long as you're willing

76
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,640
to let Yi Xin die with me.

77
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,320
Father.

78
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:30,720
Your Majesty,

79
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,900
forgive my incompetence.

80
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,880
The Fengming garrison has fallen.

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,800
Li's army
and the Kingdom Restoration League

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,290
have taken over the entire garrison,

83
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,080
They're advancing with overwhelming force.

84
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,000
It seems

85
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,370
a bloody battle is now inevitable.

86
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,120
Perhaps we should first send envoys

87
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,580
to probe for negotiation.

88
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,440
If they are smart enough,

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,660
they wouldn't want
mutual destruction either.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,300
I'm afraid they have lost

91
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,570
their minds.

92
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
If we're to make peace,

93
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,760
Li's ten prefectures must be returned.

94
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,160
Since ancient times,

95
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,120
losers are always

96
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
in the wrong.

97
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,360
They still

98
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,280
refuse to accept it, huh?

99
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,200
That's a daydream.

100
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,990
The princess of the former dynasty said...

101
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,800
Speak freely.

102
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,320
She demands the restoration

103
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,680
of the Jiang dynasty.

104
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,159
You may leave.

105
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
That is outright provocation.

106
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,820
It doesn't matter.

107
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,640
I never

108
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,300
held out hope for them anyway.

109
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,960
But with war upon us,

110
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,659
I wonder...

111
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,840
That girl from the Yue family

112
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,170
is still in their hands.

113
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,160
Mm.

114
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,330
I'll go to Xue Jingguan.

115
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,120
You still think she'd

116
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,780
let her go for old times' sake?

117
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,570
It seems this battle

118
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,960
is inevitable.

119
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,320
So?

120
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,600
You asked me out

121
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,300
to disrupt the army's morale?

122
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,320
I just feel sorry

123
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,800
that this

124
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,520
is how it ends between us.

125
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,240
Wasn't it your choice?

126
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,050
You won't help me,

127
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,870
but there are others loyal to me.

128
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,450
Although you have the support of Li State,

129
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,200
Yi Qingyun is not a good person.

130
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,840
Keeping a tiger by your side

131
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,780
will only harm yourself in the end.

132
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,720
He's nothing but a sickly cat.

133
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,350
Spare me

134
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,760
your concern.

135
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,360
But...

136
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,120
Prime Minister Yue,
you've always placed the people first.

137
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,840
If you really care about them,

138
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,520
why don't you persuade Huo Jingheng

139
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,600
to surrender?

140
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,200
Let the past

141
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,200
stay in the past.

142
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,880
There's no point in me keeping

143
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,140
this bone whistle now.

144
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,840
I'm giving it to you.

145
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,480
No need.

146
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
What wasn't given back then

147
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,360
needn't be given now.

148
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,890
As for this bone whistle

149
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,440
or the one giving it,

150
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,000
I have never

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,780
liked them.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,800
So?

153
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,390
Wei Zhang's men reported

154
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,010
His Majesty has snuck into the garrison.

155
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,510
Let's hope everything will go smoothly.

156
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,800
Ling'er.

157
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,200
You've suffered.

158
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,680
You've lost so much weight.

159
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,880
I'm fine.

160
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,540
What about you?

161
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,310
How did you manage to sneak in here?

162
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,160
Your brother is outside

163
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,560
stalling Jiang Yunqing.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,100
After I snuck in,

165
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,440
I ran into Shuo.

166
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,400
He managed

167
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,200
to get me

168
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,360
a soldier's uniform

169
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,600
and led me here to you.

170
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,760
I'm familiar with this place.

171
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll go with you.

172
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,430
Don't move!

173
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,960
Search over here! Quickly!

174
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,800
Search!

175
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,040
Oh no.

176
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,180
Did they

177
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,560
find out you got in?

178
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,410
It might be because of this.

179
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,210
I didn't expect them to find out so fast.

180
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,080
I'll go lure them away.

181
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,430
You take the commander's seal and leave.

182
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,080
Who told you to steal
the commander's seal?

183
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,810
I don't want to see a bloodbath.

184
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,970
On the battlefield,

185
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,270
soldiers follow their commanders.

186
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,040
Who'd care about the commander's seal?

187
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,440
But someone would.

188
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,380
As long as there's one person

189
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,110
willing to surrender and stop,

190
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,840
there'll be fewer casualties.

191
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm sorry.

192
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,120
War isn't as simple

193
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,160
as you think.

194
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,440
Enough.

195
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,720
Let's not discuss

196
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,920
the big picture here.

197
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,160
Think about

198
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,600
what we should do now.

199
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,680
Behind the barracks,

200
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,880
there's a small path.

201
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,680
When it gets dark,

202
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,810
I'll take you there.

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,720
No.

204
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,630
It's too dangerous for you

205
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,280
to go with us.

206
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,040
I'm more familiar with this place
than anyone else.

207
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,280
I'll just get you out.

208
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,160
I'll be fine.

209
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,820
Hurry! Search everywhere!

210
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,860
The princess said

211
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,170
we must do whatever it takes to find them!

212
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,640
Huo Jingheng.

213
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,760
How dare you sneak into Li's army's camp!

214
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,840
And you're trying
to take Ling'er and Shuo away.

215
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,400
I won't let you off.

216
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
Sister, I beg you to stop.

217
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,840
The people are now living peaceful lives.

218
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,800
There's no need for more

219
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,860
-unnecessary casualties.
-Shut up!

220
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,880
Arrest them all.

221
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,180
Ling'er, take Shuo and leave first!

222
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,880
Okay.

223
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,640
Watch out!

224
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,560
Shuo! Shuo!

225
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
Shuo.

226
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,210
Shuo!

227
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,400
Let's go.

228
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,600
Let's go!

229
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,650
Shuo.

230
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,080
Young Master!

231
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,280
Shuo.

232
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,160
It's alright.

233
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,120
I'm here.

234
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,600
It's okay.

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,380
Sister,

236
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,000
Former Ning is gone.

237
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,820
It's just gone.

238
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,920
It's alright.

239
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,440
I'm here.

240
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,000
It's okay.

241
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,000
Let...

242
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,520
Let it go.

243
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Sister.

244
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Sister!

245
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,320
Sister.

246
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,640
Shuo. Shuo!

247
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,640
Look at me!

248
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,830
Shuo!

249
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,890
Shuo!

250
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Everything will be alright.

251
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,530
I promise.

252
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,960
Soldiers, listen to my command!

253
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,200
Kill without mercy!

254
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,490
-Yes!
-Yes!

255
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,040
Ling'er, go!

256
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,480
Ling'er!

257
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
Ling'er!

258
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,920
Ling'er!

259
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,840
Ling'er!

260
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,660
Ling'er!

261
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,060
Ling'er!

262
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,960
Wei Zhang.

263
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,090
Have you found Ling'er?

264
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
At the foot of that cliff,

265
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,280
there's a farmhouse.

266
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
I've sent people to search the area.

267
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,060
What's the situation in Li State now?

268
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,320
Li's army gave the prince

269
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,180
a funeral with full royal honors.

270
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,440
Besides that,

271
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,290
is there anything unusual?

272
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,020
It's unusually...

273
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,720
quiet.

274
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,120
Princess,

275
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,980
have you made up your mind?

276
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,520
Are you afraid?

277
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,520
I'll follow you for the rest of my life.

278
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,520
Everything...

279
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,370
is about to end.

280
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,560
Boys,

281
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,520
you are the ones dearest to me.

282
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,570
But the country comes first

283
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,880
before the family!

284
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,560
May you

285
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,560
charge to the front,

286
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,120
fight with courage,

287
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,700
and defend our homes and country.

288
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes!

289
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,350
To battle!

290
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,800
Fight with courage!

291
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,240
Defend our homes and country!

292
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,600
Fight with courage!

293
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,260
Defend our homes and country!

294
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,800
Fight with courage!

295
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,180
Defend our homes and country!

296
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,550
Fight with courage!

297
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,040
Defend our homes and country!

298
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,280
Fight with courage!

299
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,720
Defend our homes and country!

300
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,900
Fight with courage!

301
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,590
Defend our homes and country!

302
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,660
Loyal to the princess
and the crown prince!

303
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,060
No regrets even if I die 100 times!

304
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,920
No regrets even if I die 100 times!

[Fengming Town]

306
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,580
Finally, they're here.

307
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:57,610
People should follow Heaven's will.

308
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,340
[Fengming Town]

309
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,400
Today,

310
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,090
all of you

311
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,800
are going to die.

312
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,609
Soldiers of Ning!

313
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,880
Prime Minister and I

314
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,079
will stand and fight beside you!

315
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,160
Kill!

316
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,480
Avenge the crown prince!

317
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,109
Kill!

318
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,470
[Fengming Town]

319
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,450
Yue Chi, behind you!

320
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,840
Uncle Liu.

321
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,880
Uncle Liu!

322
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,160
It's been a day,

323
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,150
and she hasn't eaten anything.

324
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,640
Yue Chi,

325
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,920
take good care of Her Ladyship.

326
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,600
Uncle Liu!

327
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,200
Go.

328
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,280
Go.

329
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,330
Dugu Xing!

330
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,640
Wei Zhang!

331
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,560
Wei Zhang.

332
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,240
Wei Zhang.

333
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,600
Hang in there, Wei Zhang.

334
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,040
Your Majesty.

335
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,760
Why don't you...

336
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,940
sing with her every night?

337
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,560
Instead, why are you only
reviewing memorials here?

338
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,760
That phrase is "partying every night."

339
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,850
What a nuisance.

340
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,030
We might as well just arrest her.

341
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,880
Besides arresting and killing people,

342
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,350
what else is in your mind?

343
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,530
I think

344
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,080
she likes you.

345
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,840
I think...

346
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,560
you should stop thinking.

347
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,880
Hang in there!

348
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,800
Wei Zhang. Wei Zhang!

349
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,280
The old general

350
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,080
grows attached to everything

351
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,940
he raises here.

352
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,750
So,

353
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,280
he named it Little Heng.

354
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,690
Now you're craving it, aren't you?

355
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,300
Something's wrong!

356
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,230
Everyone, stop!

357
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,800
If we keep fighting, we'll all die here!

358
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,280
Stop!

359
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,080
Stop fighting!

360
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,810
Stop!

361
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Stop fighting!

362
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,160
Why was there an explosion?

363
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,560
You planted explosives?

364
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,360
[Fengming Town]

365
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,810
I merely chose the path

366
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,600
that I believe to be right.

367
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Stop struggling.

368
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,080
The entire Fengming garrison

369
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,200
has become a powder keg.

370
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,120
Whether Ning or Li,

371
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,440
or everyone at the border,

372
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,040
I want them all to die with Shuo.

373
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,480
Xue Jingguan,

374
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,800
you're truly crazy.

375
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,280
Li's soldiers can

376
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,450
sacrifice their lives for the country,

377
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,240
but they will never

378
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,840
become your burial objects!

Stop fighting!

your crown prince

384
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,590
to die in a foreign land

atop this city wall,

00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,120
you can stop.

♪ So innocent, I can't bear to see you
turn away ♪

576
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,520
Don't be upset.

577
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,490
Have a drink.

578
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:18,160
♪ So innocent, I can't bear to see you
turn away ♪

579
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,500
We haven't said our toast yet.

580
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,200
First wish—

581
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,080
peace and prosperity.

582
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,640
Second wish—

583
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,520
safety of our state.

584
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,000
Empty words.

585
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,640
-Then you say one.
-I wish

586
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,000
we could share

587
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,620
joy together every year.

588
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,320
That person

589
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,970
might not be me.

590
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
I knew something was wrong with you.

591
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,740
I want to resign.

592
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,330
Hear me out.

593
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,060
First, it's for the greater good.

594
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,660
As long as I stay in the court,

595
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,320
I'll always be a potential problem to you.

596
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,920
I appointed you

597
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,050
as the prime minister against all odds

598
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
because I don't care

599
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,880
about others' opinions.

600
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,860
We've been through so much together.

601
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,480
You will always be my

602
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,040
closest friend and the one I trust most.

603
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,240
Second,

604
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,680
it's also for myself.

605
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,580
You're still thinking about her?

606
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,450
Jingguan asked me repeatedly in tears

607
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,130
why I wouldn't help her.

608
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,680
But I kept clinging to

609
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,140
what I believed was right.

610
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,400
Yue Chi,

611
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,800
it was not your fault.

612
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,920
But she's dead,

613
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,750
and I'm alive.

614
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,890
Consider this a vacation for myself.

615
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,800
Will we meet again?

616
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,900
We will, Huo Jingheng.

617
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,920
We'll meet again.

618
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,070
One more time.

619
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,160
This is...

620
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,760
Ms. Xue asked someone

621
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,000
to give it to me

622
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,240
for safekeeping.

623
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,480
She said if someone came

624
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,780
to pay respects to the late empress,

625
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,180
I should give this to him.

626
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,640
I'm sorry.

627
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,720
Yue Chi.

628
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,280
Fate has given me

629
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,600
gifts I don't deserve.

630
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,560
I can only accept one.

631
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,840
Don't choose me in the next life.

632
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,810
At that moment in that year,

633
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,100
if only I were the one

634
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,980
who helped you up.

635
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,680
Your Grace!

636
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,880
Slow down!

637
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,560
Your Grace!

638
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,280
Slow down!

639
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,330
I adore you.

640
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,290
I like you.

641
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,040
I want you

642
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,460
to stay, not just today.

643
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,170
Every day from now on,

644
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:11,930
I hope

645
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,290
you can stay by my side,

646
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,850
helping me and accompanying me,

647
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,290
the emperor

648
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,520
and also the man

649
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,820
in front of you.

650
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:28,450
Ling'er,

651
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,930
are you willing?
