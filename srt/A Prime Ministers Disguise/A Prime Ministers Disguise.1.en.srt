185
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,020
I haven't given you permission to die yet.

186
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,880
You're not going to die so easily.

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,690
Wei Zhang.

188
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,840
Keep a close eye on her.

189
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,900
Wait until I return
from the morning court.

190
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,750
You're going to enter the palace as me?

191
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,500
That's right.

192
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,240
Since childhood, people have
always said that we look alike.

193
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,660
I'll disguise myself properly

194
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,420
and explore the ways
for you in the palace.

195
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,720
Once I confirm that Huo Jingheng is
worthy of a lifelong commitment,

196
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,520
we'll switch our identities back
without anyone noticing.

197
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,790
Okay.

198
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,240
No way.

199
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,080
Commander,

200
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,320
you've fought against
the Emperor dozens of times

201
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,790
in dozens of battles.

202
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,120
What if he recognizes you?

203
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,340
That's impossible.

204
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,470
Back then, the army favored
a masculine appearance.

205
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,440
The former Emperor thought
I didn't look masculine enough,

206
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
so he ordered me to
wear a mask in the army.

207
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,150
Huo Jingheng has never seen my face.

208
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,960
But I've heard that
Huo Jingheng once studied

209
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,000
at the same school as you and your sister.

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,600
It only lasted for two years.

211
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,720
Back then, he was still a small kid.

212
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,840
What's wrong?

213
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,800
Don't I look like my sister?

214
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,460
Well,

215
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,300
you just don't look feminine enough.

216
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,470
How am I not feminine enough?

217
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,940
Your waist isn't flexible enough,

218
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,240
and you're not petite enough.

219
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,790
I disagree.

220
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,230
At first glance,

221
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,500
he looks exactly like me.

222
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,330
That's right.

223
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,960
We're identical.

224
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,750
Are you two really identical?

225
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,090
I know.

226
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,760
Brother,

227
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,440
apply some more rouge to your face.

228
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,140
And I have a mole
at the corner of my eye, don't I?

229
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,470
If you add that,
we'll be exactly the same.

230
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:00,910
No need.

231
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,500
Just try it.

232
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,950
I don't think it's necessary.

233
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,280
I'm fine in this way now.

234
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,090
Commander, please reconsider it.

235
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,020
I know you care about Lady Ling'er.

236
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,030
But this plan is too unreliable.

237
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,300
It's not entirely for Ling'er.

238
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
I do want to enter the palace myself.

239
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,300
I heard that in this imperial examination,

240
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,970
many children of the officials from
the previous dynasty were selected.

241
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,140
I'm worried that he wants to
eliminate all threats

242
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,320
and settle scores with officials
from the previous dynasty.

243
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,630
What if Ling'er enters
the palace this time

244
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,040
and gets bullied?

245
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,990
I can't let Ling'er suffer like that.

246
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,840
[Taiji Palace]

247
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,550
The Ministry of Revenue is
submitting a report.

248
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,960
This year, the weather in
all regions has been fine.

249
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,610
Our Ning Dynasty has been
established for two years.

250
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,550
However, since the vassal states
paid the tributes and taxes,

251
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,720
vassal kings have become
the internal troubles of Ning.

252
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,410
But the external threats
are urgent problems.

253
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,790
-Dispatch the army to the border.
-I suggest sending more soldiers there.

254
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,240
-The vassal kings might take advantage it.
-With both internal and external threats,

255
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,840
what should we do?

256
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,080
-Indeed.
-Indeed.

257
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,980
What should we do?

258
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,710
Since we can't make a decision,

259
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,670
let's adjourn the meeting.

260
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,430
Your Majesty, I have
one more matter to report.

261
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,040
Although you wish to show
benevolence and righteousness,

262
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,830
the Yue family's daughter, Yue Ling'er,

263
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,180
is the younger sister of Yue Chi,
the former prime minister.

264
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,940
Summoning her to the palace
as a consort is quite inappropriate.

265
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,680
This matter is of great importance.

266
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,740
Your Majesty, please reconsider it.

267
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

268
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,470
This matter has already been decided.

269
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,530
There's no need for further discussion.

270
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,190
Court is dismissed!

271
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,860
Your Majesty.

272
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,720
There's news from the Fengluan Palace.

273
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,200
Consort Yue is ready to enter the palace.

274
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,970
Would you like to meet her?

275
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,920
No.

276
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,290
Let's go back to the Yongqian Palace.

277
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,280
I want to see that female assassin.

278
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,180
Eunuch Gui.

279
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,420
Go deal with the matter I've
entrusted to you.

280
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:49,900
Yes.

281
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,600
Welcome Ms. Yue to the palace!

282
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,820
[Prince Anle's Mansion]

283
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,350
[Highly Skilled Doctor]

284
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,330
The palace is welcoming a new consort.

285
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,480
Shouldn't the consort take a carriage
according to the protocol?

286
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,950
Where is the consort's procession?

287
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,010
Where are the consort's entourages?

288
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,680
His Majesty has said that
from now on, our dynasty

289
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,910
will no longer indulge in extravagance.

290
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,600
Everything will be simplified.

291
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,060
Please be understanding.

292
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,410
Lift up the sedan chair.

293
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:25,600
[Prince Anle's Mansion]

294
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,930
You're kind of a natural beauty.

295
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,160
You have the look of good fortune.

296
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,390
Why do you have to put
yourself in such a situation?

297
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,320
My fate is all thanks to you.

298
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,170
That's right.

299
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,220
However, I've heard

300
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,730
such words too many times.

301
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,170
You may leave now.

302
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,090
Since ancient times,

303
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,290
life in the palace has
been dull and boring.

304
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,930
That's why every Emperor
has his own hobbies.

305
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,570
Dealing with people like you guys

306
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,780
is also a form of my entertainment.

307
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,350
Now I'm completely

308
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,330
interested in you,
both inside and outside.

309
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,580
Take it off.

310
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,950
Give me the precious item on your body.

311
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,680
Then I may spare your life.

312
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,230
The precious item? Is it...

313
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,280
What are you doing?

314
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,940
That's precisely what
makes it so interesting.

315
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,860
I knew she was holding something back.

316
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,610
It's so exquisite.

317
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,250
Which artisan made this?

318
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,630
It's so beautiful.

319
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,950
Thank you.

320
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,170
[Fengluan Palace]

321
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,000
It's too crazy.

322
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,200
It's too crazy.

323
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,230
This world

324
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,170
is too crazy.

325
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,830
Oh, no.

326
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,770
Your Highness.

327
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,300
Your breast has even hardened.

328
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,120
I understand.

329
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,500
It must be the stagnant energy.

330
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,390
Don't worry.

331
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,430
I'll help you massage it.

332
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,370
I'm feeling much better.

333
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,600
What's your name?

334
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,630
Your Highness,

335
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,810
my name is Yue.

336
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,540
Yue?

337
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,410
Where are the other attendants
of Fengluan Palace?

338
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,079
I'm your only personal attendant

339
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,109
inside the palace.

340
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,369
There's no one else.

341
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,290
That's all I have?

342
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,109
Your Highness!

343
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,650
Can you stop vomiting?

344
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,609
There aren't many basins
in the Fengluan Palace.

345
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,020
You can't vomit anymore.

346
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,010
What does Huo Jingheng mean by this?

347
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,360
He not only didn't give
my sister a grand reception

348
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,360
but also just ignored her like this.

349
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,110
How dare he slight my sister?

350
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,160
I'm going to get even with him.

351
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,050
Your Highness,

352
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,180
where are you going?

353
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,320
I'm going out for a walk.

354
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,800
Without His Majesty's permission,

355
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,670
you can't leave the Fengluan Palace.

356
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,740
Why is that?

357
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,020
His Majesty has said that

358
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,980
since you're a newcomer

359
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,240
and are unfamiliar with palace rules,

360
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,300
you have to thoroughly study
the 12 Palace Rules first.

361
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:00,820
Aren't there

362
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,110
12 rules?

363
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,630
Each rule consists of 10 scrolls.

364
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,460
There are 120 scrolls in total.

365
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,340
Yue.

366
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,110
Have you always been this honest?

367
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,290
His Majesty has said that

368
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,820
honesty brings blessings.

369
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,290
Can I really finish reading all of them?

370
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,640
I think it'll take quite a long time.

371
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,360
This is not okay.

372
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,460
I need to find a way

373
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,610
to make Huo Jingheng
come to me initiatively.

374
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:29,280
[Fengluan Palace]

375
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,440
Consort Hui.

376
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:32,780
[Sr. Concubine, Xia Yunshuang] [Consort Hui, Qu Yingying]
[Jr. Concubine, Zhao Yingwan]

377
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,510
So this is the Fengluan Palace?

378
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,220
Do we really have to do this?

379
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,270
His Majesty has always kept
a distance from women.

380
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,160
But he made efforts

381
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,280
to welcome Yue Ling'er into the palace.

382
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,070
She's a remnant of the previous dynasty.

383
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,800
If she gains favor in the future,

384
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,860
we'll have no chance to rise to power.

385
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,820
You have a sweet tongue.

386
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,380
When you see that bitch later,

387
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,370
compliment her on her beauty excessively.

388
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,630
Try to get close to her.

389
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,110
Yingwan,

390
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,560
you're gentle.

391
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,930
When Sr. Concubine Xia
compliments her enough,

392
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,580
you can suggest visiting her bedchamber.

393
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,560
Remember to act naturally.

394
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,140
And at that moment, I'll

395
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,950
place this aphrodisiac sachet

396
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,770
under her pillow.

397
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,490
Then we'll catch her red-handed,

398
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,240
making her publicly guilty of

399
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,920
bewitching His Majesty.

400
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,490
Yue.

401
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,840
I'm a bit thirsty.

402
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,040
Brew some tea for me.

403
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,720
Yes, Your Highness.

404
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,950
This is my chance now.

405
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,060
This must be Consort Yue.

406
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,280
You are indeed beautiful.

407
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,820
Why are you wearing a veil in the palace?

408
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,750
Unfortunately,

409
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,710
I ate many stimulating foods previously

410
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,370
and got a rash all over my face.

411
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,390
Then why are you dressed like this?

412
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,200
The Yue family is a lineage
of military generals.

413
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
I've always preferred to
dress more simply since childhood.

414
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,800
What?

415
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,980
Is it improper?

416
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,490
It's not exactly improper.

417
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,700
But it's just a bit strange.

418
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,030
I think so, too.

419
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,020
That's odd.

420
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,820
When I'm looking closely,

421
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,570
you don't look like a woman.

422
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,300
Sister, you must be joking.

423
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,460
How could I possibly not be a woman?

424
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,750
Sister, from now on,

425
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,010
don't speak of me like that again.

426
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,070
What's all this commotion about?

427
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,560
His Majesty is here!

428
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,530
Greetings, Your Majesty.

429
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,060
Huo Jingheng?

430
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,860
I'm the eldest daughter
of the Yue family.

431
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

432
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,290
You...

433
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,730
Your Majesty,

434
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,060
I think there's something
wrong with this person.

435
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,480
Look at her body.

436
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,260
It has a unique charm.

437
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,470
Your Majesty.

438
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,790
Her voice...

439
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,240
It's magnetic with a hint of seduction.

440
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,640
Good.

441
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,810
Your Majesty.

442
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,140
What about her height?

443
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,050
She's so tall and slender.

444
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,870
Her future offspring surely
won't be short, either.

445
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,280
Very good.

446
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,550
Did I say something wrong?

447
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,410
Beauty, why aren't you speaking?

448
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,660
I have a rash all over my face.

449
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,670
I fear that it might shock Your Majesty.

450
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,670
So you have a rash?

451
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,390
Yes.

452
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Alright.

453
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,480
Who are these people?

454
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,370
Y-Your Majesty,

455
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,230
these are the consorts
from various palaces.

456
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,710
This palace and that palace...

457
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,550
They all look the same to me.

458
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,170
That's enough.

459
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,790
You all

460
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,000
can accompany the newly-arrived
Consort Yue for a tour around.

461
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,730
I'm leaving.

462
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,510
But...

463
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,350
Your Majesty.

464
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:20,830
She...

465
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

466
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,170
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

467
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,060
They look exactly the same.

468
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,440
Your Highness.

469
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,690
You drew His Majesty's

470
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,210
portrait so well.

471
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,510
It's truly amazing.

472
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,920
You don't need to serve me here.

473
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,960
Go out and have fun.

474
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,090
Yes, Your Highness.

475
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,130
[Dog]

476
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,100
A letter from Ling'er.

477
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,580
Brother,

478
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,680
how have you been in the palace lately?

479
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,780
I'm very worried about your safety.

480
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,030
I think that

481
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,310
having asked you to enter
the palace in place of me

482
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,730
is really absurd.

483
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,890
It's my fault.

484
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,730
My sister still cares about me.

485
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,780
After all, Brother, now you have

486
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,120
neither power

487
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,660
nor influence.

488
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,100
Two years ago, you were
defeated by Huo Jingheng.

489
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,140
If you can't deal with Huo Jingheng,

490
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,800
it's quite reasonable.

491
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,880
I can understand it.

492
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,010
I can understand it.

493
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,560
Brother,

494
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,410
if the situation in the palace
is not favorable...

495
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,730
I'm doing fine.

496
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,260
Would I be unable to deal with him?

497
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
Just wait and see.

498
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,250
Just see how I'll keep
Huo Jingheng under control.

499
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,400
I'll turn Consort Yue into Empress Yue.

500
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,980
Your Majesty.

501
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,410
After court today,

502
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,100
why did you insist on
going to the Fengluan Palace?

503
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,970
What's more, usually,

504
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,790
you don't have trouble recognizing faces.

505
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,450
Has your memory gotten worse?

506
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,200
Should we summon the imperial physician?

507
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,030
Do you want me to reward
you with a beating first

508
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,720
and then summon the
imperial physician for you?

509
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,510
I shouldn't have said that.

510
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,370
I don't need it.

511
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,510
This is a playful interaction
between Consort Yue and me.

512
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,220
Your Majesty, you know many tricks indeed.

513
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,810
The time is about right.

514
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,530
The ban on the Fengluan
Palace can be lifted.

515
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,310
The Empress framed others with witchcraft,

516
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,630
falsely accused consorts,

517
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,440
fornicated with a man
from outside the palace,

518
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,790
replaced the crown prince with someone else,

519
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,880
interfered in state affairs

520
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,520
and misused safflower, musk,

521
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,270
oleander and gut-breaking herbs.

522
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,980
Her crimes are too numerous to be listed.

523
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,910
She is to be executed immediately.

524
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,300
Brother.

525
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,500
Why do you want me to be the Empress?

526
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,520
Ling'er!

527
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,700
I still don't know about Huo Jingheng's

528
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,870
moral character.

529
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,570
If she rashly becomes the Empress,

530
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,410
I don't know if it would be
good or bad for Ling'er.

531
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:29,750
Please send more soldiers there.

532
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,750
Stop reporting it, Lord Wei.

533
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,720
Your matter is not urgent.

534
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,010
I've... I've investigated it.

535
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,550
Your Majesty, I can
rationally foresee that...

536
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,590
It is indeed the right path.

537
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,550
We do need to send more soldiers there.

538
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,310
At 9 AM, he discussed affairs
with court officials.

539
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,310
He inquired about all the important

540
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,160
state affairs

541
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,640
and even trivial matters.

542
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,640
[Records of Dog Huo's Daily Life]

543
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,350
At 1 PM, he reviewed official documents.

544
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,800
At 5 PM,

545
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,960
he was still reviewing official documents.

546
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,270
He's been like this
for several days in a row.

547
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,540
He gets up earlier than the roosters

548
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,340
and goes to sleep later than the dogs.

549
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,620
He's kind of a good emperor
who handles state affairs diligently.

550
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,300
However, besides state affairs,

551
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,800
apart from practicing martial arts skills,

552
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,540
he only likes to collect weapons.

553
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,300
He has no other hobbies.

554
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,430
He hasn't summoned any consorts, either.

555
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,130
Could it be that...

556
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,930
Your Majesty.

557
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,750
The Empress Dowager sent someone to ask
if you would go to the harem today.

558
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,620
I won't.

559
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,300
It's just as I expected.

560
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,620
Does he have any unmentionable disease?

561
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,490
You won't go to see Consort Yue, either?

562
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,210
No, I won't.

563
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,960
Why are you staring at me like that?

564
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,680
Please forgive me first, Your Majesty.

565
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,460
Then I'll tell you.

566
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:45,920
Tell me.

567
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,790
Your Majesty.

568
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,070
You've been protective towards
Yue Ling'er for the past two years.

569
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,890
Now that she has finally
entered the palace,

570
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,110
why don't you...

571
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,160
sing with her every night?

572
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,090
Instead, why are you only
reviewing documents here?

573
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,730
That phrase is "partying every night."

574
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,310
Only a doomed ruler would do such things.

575
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,630
I have no ulterior motives

576
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,270
towards Yue Ling'er.

577
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,300
She's an orphan from the previous dynasty.

578
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,590
She has already lost
her brother's protection.

579
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,250
Anyone could bully her.

580
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,830
Her situation is not easy.

581
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:21,660
Though I've wanted to look after
the Yue family all these years,

582
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,190
I've been so busy with state affairs.

583
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,670
It's better to bring her
into the palace directly.

584
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,990
At least, she'll be safe here.

585
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,190
Huo Jingheng is too unscrupulous.

586
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,160
What a bad idea he came up with.

587
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
His Majesty is unscrupulous?

588
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,160
His Majesty is the best Emperor.

589
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,530
Where did you come from?

590
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,450
Your Highness,

591
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,320
I came to the imperial
capital as a refugee.

592
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,880
I was abducted by human traffickers.

593
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
His Majesty saved me while
having an incognito visit.

594
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,830
He even allowed me to enter
the palace and be a maid.

595
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,760
He gave me a chance to make a living.

596
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,760
Actually, there are many things
that I can't do well.

597
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,790
But His Majesty never minds it.

598
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,320
He even secretly asked
someone to protect me.

599
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,990
He doesn't want me to suffer.

600
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
His Majesty is a good person.

601
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,110
Huo Jingheng may be a bit unscrupulous,

602
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,540
but he's not a bad person.

603
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,830
He treats a young girl
he has never met before

604
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,880
with such kindness and righteousness.

605
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,340
He has done his best
to protect Ling'er, too.

606
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,470
Perhaps for Ling'er,

607
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,080
he's really worthy of
a lifelong commitment.

608
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,110
Yue,

609
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,300
please get me a pen.

610
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,480
I'm going to write a letter to my family.

611
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,030
Your Highness,

612
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,220
you don't need to send a letter.

613
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,600
I was just about to inform you that

614
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,060
your family had come here.

615
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,150
Who's here?

616
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,210
Over there.

617
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,930
Why are you here?

618
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,490
What if someone discovers you?

619
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,910
Brother, don't be nervous.

620
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,170
Don't call me Brother.

621
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,790
I came here in an aboveboard way.

622
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,910
Don't worry.

623
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,540
I'm a maid from Prince Anle's Mansion.
Greetings, Consort Yue.

624
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,350
Do I look like a maid?

625
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,310
Of course not.

626
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,080
Go back home now.

627
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,010
This is not okay.

628
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,740
You'd better go back
through the window.

629
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,740
I don't want that.

630
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,660
Today,

631
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,910
I'm here to check your progress.

632
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,800
How is it?

633
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,470
How are you doing in the palace?

634
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,800
Is Huo Jingheng a reliable man?

635
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,160
There's nothing particularly
special about him.

636
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,000
He just exercises every day,

637
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,660
handles state affairs diligently
and has simple hobbies.

638
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,400
He doesn't indulge in women's allure

639
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,200
and is quite healthy

640
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,130
with a good look.

641
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,390
He also has the intention to protect you.

642
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,600
It seems that it's kind of
favorable for you.

643
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,450
So you're satisfied with Huo Jingheng?

644
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,830
That depends on what you think.

645
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,200
What do you think?

646
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,100
I...

647
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,130
Which of us

648
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,120
is getting married?

649
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,350
Aren't you my brother?

650
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,810
Shouldn't you vet him
for me more carefully?

651
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,790
Do you think Huo Jingheng
is reliable enough?

652
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,390
He's relatively reliable.

653
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,290
That's fine then.

654
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,590
But he's a very boring man.

655
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,720
As a husband,

656
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,200
he might not be...

657
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,640
That's not important.

658
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,110
As long as you're satisfied, it's fine.

659
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,170
I'm satisfied?

660
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,460
So you're willing to enter the palace

661
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,010
and become the Empress?

662
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,700
Yes, I am.

663
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,590
Alright.

664
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,060
If that's the case,

665
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,040
I'll definitely help you
get the position of Empress.

666
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,360
I still need you to prepare
some things for me.

667
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:17,920
[Elegant Dwelling with Spring Grace]

668
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,980
Eunuch Gui, please stay for a moment.

669
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,170
Greetings, Your Highness.

670
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,690
I've heard that your mother has a cold

671
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,850
that remains unhealed for a long time.

672
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,190
I happen to have

673
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,850
a prescription from the Western Regions.

674
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,510
It has miraculous effects for

675
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,700
treating cold illnesses.

676
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,390
Sister.

677
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,090
It's Consort Yue.

678
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,640
She's trying to get close
to Eunuch Gui there.

679
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,110
Consort Yue, you're very thoughtful.

680
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,210
I wonder what you want to order me to do.

681
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,910
I wouldn't dare to give orders to you.

682
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,510
I just want you to do me a small favor.

683
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,090
Then I'll leave now.

684
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,210
Over these years,

685
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,270
so many consorts have tried to
bribe people from the Yongqian Palace

686
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,350
to gain His Majesty's favor.

687
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,830
Have you ever seen His Majesty
pay any attention to them?

688
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,300
She might irritate His Majesty

689
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,030
and be convicted of a serious crime.

690
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,150
What is this?

691
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,740
It's a gift from Consort Yue.

692
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,240
I dare not to open it arbitrarily.

693
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,040
Consort Yue?

694
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,440
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

695
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,090
I know nothing about it!

696
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,370
Let's go to the Fengluan Palace now.

697
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,050
Consort Yue.

698
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,710
How dare you!

699
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,310
Guards!

700
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,200
Arrest her!

701
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,800
How did you get this Qinggang Dagger?

702
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,300
Is it genuine?

703
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,300
Do you have any other ones like this?

704
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,940
Your Majesty, why don't we go inside to talk?

705
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,160
Sister.

706
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
Sister, bad news.

707
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,170
I heard that His Majesty
went to the Fengluan Palace.

708
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,040
Why are you panicking?

709
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,630
Perhaps His Majesty just
went inside for a brief visit.

710
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,960
Cao Pi, the Crown Prince of Wei,
made three powerful daggers.

711
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,470
One of them had patterns like ice

712
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,800
and was named Qinggang.

713
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,460
My brother got it by chance
when he was alive.

714
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,940
Since it's destined to be with you,

715
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,540
then I'll give it to you.

716
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,310
Sister, bad news!

717
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,170
I heard that His Majesty
stayed there overnight.

718
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,570
Perhaps His Majesty was just
interested in her momentarily.

719
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,230
He'll forget her in a few days.

720
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,540
This one is beautiful, too.

721
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,880
This battle-axe

722
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,130
is extremely sharp

723
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,630
and powerful.

724
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,260
The Panlong Rod.

725
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,990
It is said to have originated
from Emperor Taizu of Song.

726
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,390
As the saying goes, "Fists strike the centerline,

727
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,600
while rods strike a whole area."

728
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,140
"When the Panlong Rod is used,

729
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,500
its power can break mountains and rivers."

730
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,600
Were these treasures

731
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,370
truly acquired by your brother
by chance when he was alive?

732
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,510
My brother was used to seeing
rare treasures when he was alive.

733
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,040
These are just a few of them.

734
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,750
Sister!

735
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,380
Bad news!

736
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,700
What is it now?

737
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,810
The news is spread in the entire harem.

738
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,590
His Majesty has been staying at
Fengluan Palace for over 10 days in a row.

739
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,790
Consort Yue has become the favored one.

740
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,640
Your Majesty, if you like them,

741
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,100
you can take them all away.

742
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,020
Okay.

743
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,770
Consort Yue, you're generous.

744
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,470
I'm so pleased with you.

745
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,190
These are all my treasures.

746
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,920
I was just being polite.

747
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,350
You really want them all?

748
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,190
You may all leave now.

749
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,389
Father, Mother,

750
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,850
Eldest Brother and Second Brother.

751
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,460
[Memorial Tablet of My Father, Qu Tengsheng]
[Memorial Tablet of My Mother, Zhang Huayu]

752
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,850
I'm here to see you all.

753
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,440
[Memorial Tablet of My Brother, Qu Zhousheng]
[Memorial Tablet of My Brother, Qu Liusheng]

754
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,330
If Yue Chi had not

755
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,460
set up a trap in Shilipo back then,

756
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:29,690
my father and brothers wouldn't
have been killed in Shilipo.

757
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,440
And my mother wouldn't have died of grief.

758
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:37,300
Our Qu family wouldn't have been ruined.

759
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,480
Don't worry.

760
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,230
I'll make the Yue family
pay the price with their lives

761
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,060
to comfort your souls in Heaven.

762
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,000

763
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,219
[Memorial Tablet of My Brother, Qu Zhousheng]
[Memorial Tablet of My Brother, Qu Liusheng]

764
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,230
Yue Ling'er.

765
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,500
As for all the crimes
your brother committed,

766
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:55,650
I'll make you pay the price for them all.
