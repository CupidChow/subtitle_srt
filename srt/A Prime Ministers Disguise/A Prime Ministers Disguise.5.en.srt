[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,870
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,300
I have a feeling that Huo Jingheng's drunken words

4
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,690
were a bit strange,

5
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,840
as if he deliberately said them for me to hear.

6
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,539
Could he already know something?

7
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,950
When did he find out?

8
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,550
Was Ling'er being summoned to the palace

9
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,960
just a coincidence?

10
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,170
Yue.

11
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,479
Go check if the pastries from the kitchen

12
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,370
are ready.

13
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,039
Alright.

14
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,170
Yes, Your Highness.

15
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,590
Ling'er.

16
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,039
Chi.

17
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,500
Come.

18
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,250
Be careful.

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,289
Come.

20
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,900
Was your journey smooth?

21
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,840
It went very smoothly.

22
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,870
Someone came to escort me here

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,070
as soon as I got off the carriage.

24
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,150
But Chi,

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
why did you suddenly call for me?

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,610
Is there something urgent?

27
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,350
I just want to ask you,

28
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,870
do you still want to be the Empress?

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,750
If you have feelings for someone else

30
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,640
and you don't want to enter the palace,

31
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,440
just tell me as soon as possible.

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,660
I'll make other plans for you.

33
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,860
Who could I possibly have feelings for?

34
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,610
During these days
at the Prime Minister's Mansion,

35
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,140
don't you have any feelings

36
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,210
for Du Tianzhao?

37
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,430
Feelings?

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,150
Of course not.

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,240
Are you telling the truth?

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,570
Of course.

41
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,920
Then what do you think of Huo Jingheng?

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,920
His Majesty?

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,340
His Majesty

44
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,810
is a rare and brilliant ruler.

45
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,280
He's accomplished in both civil
and military matters,

46
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,350
wise, brilliant,

47
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,840
kind-hearted, benevolent,

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,150
naturally pure and good,

49
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,610
and very trustworthy.

50
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,870
Chi, what do you...

51
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,890
think of His Majesty?

52
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,380
Hmm...

53
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,700
You...

54
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,770
You think...

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,950
so highly of him?

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,940
Then it's settled.

57
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,680
Since you have feelings for him anyway...

58
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,370
Yes.

59
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,560
You won't mind switching back with me.

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,450
Switching back?

61
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,680
Starting today,

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,060
you'll be the one to get along with Huo Jingheng.

63
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,430
So soon?

64
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,280
Are you planning to leave the palace?

65
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,860
Are you willing or not?

66
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,520
I am.

67
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,270
But I think now is not a good time

68
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,590
to switch back.

69
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,430
It's better to act sooner than later.

70
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,200
I've done all I can.

71
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,500
The rest can only be done by you personally.

72
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,390
Everything you need is here.

73
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,840
Just memorize it thoroughly.

74
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,020
Records of Dog Huo's Daily Life?

75
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,590
This log

76
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,160
records all the details

77
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,130
since I first entered the palace

78
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:44,870
[Day 1: Huo Jingheng practiced martial arts at 5 a.m. to stay fit—fairly self-disciplined. At 9 a.m., he met with the court officials, attending to everything from national affairs to trivial matters.]

79
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,460
and served Huo Jingheng at night.

80
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,470
You have to memorize it well

81
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,740
so you won't slip up.

82
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,700
Trouble comes from the mouth.

83
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,560
I shot myself in the foot.

84
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,750
If Chi really leaves,

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,550
what should I do?

86
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,760
His comprehension isn't bad either.

87
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,890
Given time,

88
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,380
he could achieve great things.

89
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,590
However,

90
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,790
benevolence and righteousness to him

91
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,230
[Day 2: He still practiced
martial arts at 5 a.m.]

92
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:07,350
are like water to a boat.

93
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,320
[At 9 a.m., he met with court officials,
keeping the people's well-being in mind.]

94
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,700
They can either make him

95
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,740
or break him.

96
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,779
But his benevolence and righteousness are misplaced.

97
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,589
He's actually pretty cunning
when dealing with others.

98
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,110
You know him well?

99
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,340
Not really.

100
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,130
Don't you remember, Chi?

101
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,350
I met him

102
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,330
when we were kids.

103
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,480
I'm just

104
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,590
guessing from the words

105
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,740
in this log.

106
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,409
Stop guessing.

107
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,340
Memorize it well

108
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,810
and get ready to serve him tonight.

109
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,170
Serve him tonight?

110
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,060
Consort Yue.

111
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

112
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
Well then,

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,330
Dear, keep me company again tonight

114
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,750
while I go over the memorials.

115
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,000
The person who had been with him
for so many days

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,890
was suddenly replaced,

117
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,420
yet he didn't notice anything unusual
at all.

118
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,280
Something's not right.

119
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,230
What should we do?

120
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,950
Dear, look at this advice.

121
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,390
It really speaks to me.

122
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,810
Let's not make a move now.

00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,950
My brother has fully prepared

125
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,830
and is determined to succeed.

126
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,070
What should we do now?

127
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,170
Give it to me.

128
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,990
I want to see it.

129
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,640
No matter how they try to fake it,

130
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,810
the familiarity in those little details
can't be forged.

131
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,840
The two of them have probably been
in contact in private for quite some time.

132
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,110
To avoid any complications,

133
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,310
I'll leave tomorrow.

Dog Huo has injuries on his back.

138
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,370
It hurts faintly when exposed to wind,

139
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,970
so make sure to keep him warm.

140
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,810
He prefers light food,

141
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,510
dislikes anything too strongly flavored.

142
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,920
Steamed or boiled dishes
with minimal oil and salt

143
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,770
suit him best.

144
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,730
He is a man of benevolence
and righteousness.

145
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,860
Perhaps I could marry my sister to him.

146
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,170
In this world,

147
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,890
there's no shortage of talented people
who can be generals and ministers,

148
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,290
nor ambitious schemers.

149
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,240
But it's rare to find someone who truly
values benevolence and righteousness.

150
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,680
Chi,

151
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:58,140
you're leaving already?

I've memorized the log,

153

of memorials.

154

157
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,160
I know

158
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,950
you've always been the kindest to me.

159
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,000
Please help me.

160
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,260

161

isn't there something...

00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,390
you want to tell me?

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,190
No.

-is summoned to the Imperial Garden!
-Chi,

170
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,950
did you hear that?

171
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,240
Here we go again.

172
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,980
Every time I hear that, I get nervous.

173
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,690
If I go out like this

174
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,150
and slip up,

175
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,790
it could lead to the execution of our entire Yue family.

176
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,440
Don't be afraid.

177
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Just go.

178
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,950
If something really happens,

179
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,950
I'll be long gone.

180
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,760
Given his temperament,

181
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,810
he won't make things difficult for you.

182
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,370
Go on.

186
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,060
so you are.

187
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,350
Huo Jingheng really does know
how to use people.

188
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,420
I hope he can win over my brother.

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,550
Alright.

190
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,380
You must be tired
from following me around.

191
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,220
Just take a rest here.

192
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,380
Yes, Your Highness.

193
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,510
My brother is really leaving.

194
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,640
You'd better think of a solution fast.

195
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,390
I've thought it through carefully.

196
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,810
He cares about you,

197
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,300
so he'll continue reviewing the memorials.

198
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,200
As for whose hands they're
submitted through,

199
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,980
it doesn't matter to me.

200
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,540
After all, "Consort Yue"
is still in the palace, right?

201
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,360
Listen to your own words.

202
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,680
You're being unreasonable.

203
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,920
Trying to burn bridges after crossing?

204
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,720
Consort Yue, watch your words.

205
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,720
She didn't go home all night.

206
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,870
She must be mad at me.

207
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,050
They already switched?

208
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,150
Can this really work?

209
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,590
Those two siblings are
obviously different.

210
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,300
Is my nephew blind?

211
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,260
Don't panic.

212
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,510
They've probably just met.

213
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,350
Your Majesty,

214
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,170
you may not care,

215
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,360
but I don't want to waste
my precious youth

216
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,380
stuck in the harem.

217
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,890
Aren't you a man of benevolence
and righteousness?

218
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,920
Then help me out.

219
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,250
Think about it.

220
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,770
Having him by your side would be so great.

221
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,030
Talking to him all night would be
convenient and enjoyable.

222
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,200
Sure, keeping him here might be
a bit troublesome,

223
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,770
but once it succeeds,

224
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,630
you won't lose out either.

225
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,270
Keeping him isn't easy.

226
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,990
Let me think about it.

227
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,810
So,

228
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,200
you've agreed?

229
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,670
But there's one more thing

230
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,080
you must promise me.

231
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,780
Don't come to my place again tonight.

232
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,120
I'm not like you rough guys.

233
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,320
I can't stay up late.

234
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,910
Last night was my first time serving you.

235
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,910
It really wore me out.

236
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Serving at night?

237
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,040
She was kept up most of the night?

238
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,200
Imperial Uncle,

239
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,440
you're finally back.

240
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,480
Where have you been?

241
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,600
The Empress Dowager summoned you
to meet her at 3 p.m.

242
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,250
It's already past that time.

243
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,790
Why do you look so lost?

244
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,270
Hurry up.

245
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:47,670
[Zhou Xiran,
daughter of the Grand Guard]
[Xie Yingran,
daughter of the Minister of Works]

246
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,200
Now Heng has someone

247
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,170
he cares about by his side.

248
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,840
As his uncle, you should settle down too.

249
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,720
Among so many beauties,

250
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,320
is there anyone you fancy?

251
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,370
Sister,

252
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,070
it's easy for you to say.

253
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,730
Is it that easy to find
someone you care about?

254
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,240
Besides,

255
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,370
even if I find her,

256
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,300
does that mean she'll be mine?

257
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,830
If heaven has feelings, it too grows old.

258
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,470
From today, I, Du Tianzhao,

259
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,080
will have no heart and no feelings.

260
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,670
I'll be alone for the rest of my life!

261
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,330
It's nobody else's business!

262
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,150
What nonsense are you talking about?

263
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,310
I think you need to be taught a lesson.

264
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,340
[Auspice and Blessing]

265
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,340
Wake up, you fool!

266
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,670
Who said it's easy to find your soulmate?

267
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,830
Heng

268
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,930
was single for many years

269
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,650
before he found Consort Yue.

270
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:41,770
[Auspice and Blessing]

271
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,210
One day,

272
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,200
you'll find that special someone too.

273
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,310
My special someone was stolen by him,

274
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,720
my dear sister.

275
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,810
Chi,

276
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,670
you're leaving right after dinner?

277
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,990
In such a hurry?

278
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,370
Huo Jingheng might come by again tonight.

279
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,510
I'll give you two some space.

280
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,300
No need.

281
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
We have plenty of time.

282
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,720
But you need careful planning

283
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,420
before leaving the palace.

284
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,060
Why don't you take it slow?

285
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,990
I've already planned it out.

286
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,370
What's your plan?

287
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,390
In the previous dynasty, a
favored consort loved fresh water.

288
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,270
The emperor secretly ordered
a hidden canal

289
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,600
to be built beneath the Imperial Lake,

290
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,550
connecting the waterways in
the capital to the palace.

291
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,810
I can swim through the Imperial Lake

292
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,810
to get directly outside the palace.

293
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,930
I see.

294
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,920
Let me verify

295
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,700
if it's really what I think.

296
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,600
So many flowers.

297
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,440
Yes.

298
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,320
Marigolds.

299
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

300
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,270
Your Majesty,

301
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,620
are these flowers...

302
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,790
all to be placed in the Imperial Lake?

303
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,810
Consort Yue, you love flowers.

304
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,450
I want to fill the lake and plant flowers.

305
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,630
That's not necessary.

306
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,220
It's too much trouble.

307
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,700
I think this lake is fine as it is.

308
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,230
Hmm.

309
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,810
Then I'll listen to you

310
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,280
and won't plant them.

311
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,610
Dear, you're dressed quite uniquely today.

312
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,890
You can't leave anyway.

313
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,640
Why don't you just stay?

314
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
There is no hidden canal here at all.

315
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,270
So it really is Ling'er who's been

316
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,170
tipping off Huo Jingheng.

317
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,670
You may leave now.

318
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,020
-Yes.
-Yes.

319
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,600
Your Majesty, are you planning
to live in Fengluan Palace?

320
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,000
We love each other deeply

321
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,480
and can't bear to be apart

322
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,790
even for a moment.

323
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,720
Huo Jingheng keeps setting traps

324
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,630
and pressing forward step by step.

325
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,090
What exactly does he want?

326
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,510
I just remembered

327
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,770
you still have some memorials to review.

328
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,220
Tonight,

329
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,330
I don't want to review any memorials.

330
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,030
Never mind then.

331
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,690
Your Majesty, are there any

332
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,030
difficult matters at court lately?

333
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,620
The night is long.

334
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,440
Why don't we talk about them?

335
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,950
Dear, weren't you the one who least

336
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,210
wanted to interfere in politics before?

337
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,720
Tonight you seem quite open to it.

338
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,910
In ancient times, there was a ruler
who deceived his vassals

339
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,510
just to win a beauty's smile.

340
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,600
Now I'm getting involved
in politics for you.

341
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,000
What is there to fear?

342
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,510
Very well.

343
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,030
Oh my.

344
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:23,480
[Memorial]

345
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,510
These are

346
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,310
all the difficult cases
I encountered at court,

347
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,360
and I've made notes on all of them.

348
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,630
Dear, why don't you discuss them with me?

349
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,030
This is the first one.

350
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,880
Dear, what are your thoughts?

351
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,530
Your Majesty,

352
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,060
it's time for the morning court session.

353
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,510
Your Majesty?

354
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,790
Please rise.

355
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,360
Shouldn't you be attending court now?

356
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,840
The morning air is chilly.

357
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,630
I came back

358
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,920
to give you an extra layer,

359
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,000
but I didn't expect

360
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,960
to find you leaving in such a hurry.

361
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,410
Where are you going?

362
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,960
I woke up and didn't see you.

363
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,270
Unable to bear the longing,

364
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,670
I caught up to take a look.

365
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,120
If I could catch one more
glimpse of your back,

366
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,520
that would be enough.

367
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,750
Even so,

368
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,200
it's a bit reckless.

369
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,030
If you had walked too fast
and gotten hurt,

370
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,000
wouldn't I have lost my helper?

371
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,599
Your Majesty, you're right.

372
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,640
This helper is going back to work now.

373
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,480
Do you still have many
difficult cases left to review?

374
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,720
While I'm away,

375
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,240
you must protect Consort Yue well.

376
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
-Yes!
-Yes!

377
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:20,720
Go.

378
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,610
Chi.

379
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,110
You seem so happy.

380
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,090
You don't want to enter the palace

381
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,940
and marry Huo Jingheng,

382
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,610
do you?

383
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,480
Chi,

384
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,170
actually, I didn't think it through.

385
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,440
At first,

386
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,270
I agreed in the heat of the moment.

387
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,200
But after spending time with His Majesty,

388
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,800
I realized I have no romantic
feelings for him.

389
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,750
I'm sorry.

390
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,950
I don't want to marry him anymore.

391
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,880
I'm very disappointed.

392
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,810
Ling'er, if you have any concerns,

393
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,810
why can't you just tell me directly?

394
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,200
To me,

395
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,870
your feelings matter most.

396
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,160
If there's even a trace of reluctance,

397
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,560
you shouldn't marry him.

398
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,830
No matter who he is,

399
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,160
we don't care.

400
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,860
Chi.

401
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,590
She's my own sister—

402
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,440
how could I not spoil her?

403
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,200
Since that's the case,

404
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,460
we'll change the plan.

405
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,220
I'll arrange for you to leave
the palace first.

406
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,550
Once you're safe,

407
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,570
I'll find another chance to escape.

408
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,940
Then won't Huo Jingheng be able to keep him?

409
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,420
What now?

410
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,230
How about this?

411
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,860
Let's discuss it a bit more.

412
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,240
The longer you stay,

413
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,680
the more trouble you'll face.

414
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,640
Hurry and pack your things.

415
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,770
Leave immediately.

416
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,310
So many people?

417
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,160
Yes.

418
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,160
Every time we're out, there are

419
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
so many imperial guards following.

420
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,830
How can we possibly leave?

421
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,680
It's good that the imperial guards are here.

422
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,480
Chi can't run away now.

423
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,050
Everything has its match.

424
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,300
Only that person in the entire palace

425
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,990
can keep Huo Jingheng in check.

426
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,520
Looks like we can only use this way to get away.

427
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,000
I have a bad feeling about this.

428
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,240
I am of humble appearance,

429
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,730
without talent or virtue.

430
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,030
Since entering the palace,

431
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,210
I've been blessed with the care
of His Majesty and Your Grace,

432
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,940
for which I am deeply grateful.

433
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,470
I dare not monopolize His Majesty's favor.

434
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,760
I plan to use three months' salary

435
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,510
to invite Yanshuang Opera Troupe
in the capital to the palace,

436
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,700
and invite all sisters in the palace
to present their talents as well.

437
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,100
Your Grace,
I humbly ask for your approval.

438
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,890
She's really pushing her luck.

439
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,170
Qu,

440
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,830
Consort Yue asked the Empress Dowager
for rewards for the whole palace,

441
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,960
giving us a chance

442
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,240
to show ourselves before His Majesty.

443
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,000
Isn't that a good thing?

444
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,000
What do you know?

445
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,710
She's playing a strategic retreat.

446
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,970
Now that she's in favor

447
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,550
and already a consort anyway.

448
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,480
Now that she has pulled this stunt,

449
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,830
all the consorts in the palace are saying

450
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,620
she's kind, dignified, and understands propriety.

451
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,420
If His Majesty whimsically

452
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,710
makes her the Empress,

453
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,250
Then I...

454
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,880
So what do you plan to do?

455
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,380
Why her, of all people?

456
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,250
I suppose Consort Yue is quite special.

457
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,510
Bah!

458
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,550
I'll make her realize

459
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,310
that no flower blooms forever.

460
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,310
Hey!

461
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,310
You were once a princess.

462
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,550
Tell me,

463
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,590
what's so good

464
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,980
about staying in this palace?

465
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,350
As a consort,

466
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,310
no matter how rich

467
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,000
or how favored,

468
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,980
you're still just a bird in a cage,

469
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,680
a fish in a pond.

470
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,910
It can't compare to the freedom of being by my side.

471
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,050
I won't force her to do anything.

472
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,680
Why does she have to enter the palace?

473
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,180
Who are you talking about?

474
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,360
Whoever she is!

475
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,650
Is it Ling'er?

476
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,400
Yes.

477
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,160
Yes.

478
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,050
What's your relationship with her?

479
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,000
What's it to you?

480
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,920
You like her?

481
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,800
Let go of me!

482
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,990
I'm warning you,

483
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,980
stay away from her.

484
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,160
Don't get involved with her.

485
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,240
Ling'er and Yue Chi

486
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,070
shouldn't get too close to anyone

487
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,840
from your new imperial family.

488
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,260
What?

489
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,660
It's dangerous.

490
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,890
Dangerous?

491
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,850
For whom?

492
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,060
Only by leaving the capital

493
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,060
will they be completely safe.

494
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,890
You crazy woman!

495
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,880
The commander has ordered

496
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,080
that you can't leave!

497
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,350
Put down your swords!

498
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,640
She's got a sword to my neck.

499
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,180
Come protect me.

00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,480

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,720
Let her go.

Where's Dugu Xing?

503
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,900
He's carrying out a secret mission under the commander's order.

504
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,150
Secret mission?

Walk slowly.

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,210
It would be better if I didn't step on it.

525
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,300
I'd like to see if they'd still dare

526
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,430

you put into dressing up if you leave now?

That's true.

in every dynasty for the consorts

00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,120
finally get a grandson now.

562
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,530
Alright, Mother.

563
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,370
Stop saying that. Let's begin.

564
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,510
Later,

565
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,200
all the consorts will show their talents.

566
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,970
There will be quite a show.

567
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,150
Watch how I escape later.

568
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,840
I'd like to see what tricks you're up to.

569
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,030
[Tianwei Gate]

570
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,030
General Dugu,

571
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,920
did my brother say

572
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,120
where we'll go once we leave the palace?

573
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,660
He didn't.

574
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,110
Didn't you ask?

575
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,240
There's no need to ask

576
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,100
when following military orders.

577
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,350
I think...

578
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,350
there's some misunderstanding

579
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,830
between my brother and His Majesty.

580
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,590
He

581
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,070
actually doesn't want to leave.

582
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,680
Why don't we call it off?

583
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,270
My Lady,

584
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,300
if you keep talking like this,

585
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,150
I'll have someone send you back.

586
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,880
Bestow a peach blossom on her.

587
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,750
Lady Lan, please take the flower.

588
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

589
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,090
I can also perform sword dancing.

590
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,830
May I offer you another dance, Your Majesty?

591
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,640
Bestow her another flower.

592
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,000
Another flower!

593
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,250
Consort Hui will present
the Swift Battle Breakthrough Tune.

594
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,380
Bestow her a flower.

595
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,110
What...

596
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,220
what flower?

597
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,660
But I haven't played yet,

598
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,460
Your Majesty.

599
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,160
Bestow a white peony on her.

600
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,550
A white peony.

601
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,510
-Peony?
-Peony?

602
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,750
"Only the peony truly represents
national beauty."

603
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,880
Could it be that His Majesty
has already made a decision?

604
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,440
Your Grace,

605
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,510
I have a unique skill as well.

606
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,750
You must be interested.

607
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,560
Consort Yue,
you want to show your talent too?

608
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,830
What are you going to show?

609
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,110
Uprooting willows by the roots

610
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,790
or breaking a big stone with your chest?

611
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,690
Neither.

612
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,470
Please wait a moment.

613
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,160
This is our Yue family's secret technique,

614
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,310
called "Returning to the Source."

615
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,400
Returning to the Source?

616
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,420
What does it mean?

617
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,960
May I borrow your hairpin?

618
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,750
Thank you.

619
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,640
Returning to origin

620
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,420
and tracing the source.

621
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,000
Returning to origin

622
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,030
and tracing the source.

623
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,940
This is the origin of this hairpin.

624
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,830
That's right.

625
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,550
This hairpin is made from
an entire piece of coral.

626
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,790
It's very precious.

627
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,030
I present it to you, Your Grace.

628
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,550
I wish you longevity

629
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,470
and blessings that last forever.

630
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,100
Your Grace, look.

631
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,820
What a wonderful item.

632
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,450
This is the handkerchief I carry with me.

633
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,770
Returning to origin and tracing the source.

634
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,220
Returning to origin and tracing the source.

635
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,590
Your Highness?

636
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,130
Yue?

637
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,350
How can it be Yue?

638
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,550
She conjured up a person out of thin air.

639
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,720
Your Highness, I was just making pastries for you.

640
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,400
Why did I suddenly come here?

641
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,700
That's right.

642
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,440
This handkerchief was made by Yue.

643
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,060
How amazing!

644
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,640
Marvelous, truly marvelous.

645
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,000
Consort Yue,

646
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,620
may I try

647
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,640
your secret technique?

648
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,200
Of course.

649
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,360
However,

650
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,050
today His Majesty is bestowing flowers.

651
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,600
I'm thinking…

652
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,640
why not let His Majesty try it first?

653
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,550
Well said.

654
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,400
Let him have a try.

655
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,930
Dear, is this secret technique

656
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,440
for real?

657
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,720
It is.

658
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,330
Can it trace the source

659
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,310
of anything?

660
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,440
Yes.

661
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,630
Very well.

662
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,290
Your Majesty, you are the supreme ruler.

663
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,830
Your wishes carry more weight
than ordinary people's.

664
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,350
I fear that my single prayer

665
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,010
may not be granted by the gods.

666
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,860
Therefore,

667
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,030
I need everyone here to close their eyes

668
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,370
and chant

669
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,830
"Returning to the origin

670
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,550
and tracing the source" with me.

671
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,480
You may stop only when I say so.

672
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,560
By then,

673
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,480
your wish will manifest itself.

674
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,480
Don't disappoint me.

675
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,070
Returning to the origin

676
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,180
and tracing the source.

677
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,160
Returning to the origin

678
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,960
and tracing the source.

679
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,920
Returning to the origin

680
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,400
and tracing the source.

681
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,680
Returning to origin and tracing the source.

682
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,400
Returning to origin and tracing the source.

683
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,270
Returning to origin and tracing the source.

684
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,970
Play with me?

685
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,310
Goodbye.

686
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,890
Huo Jingheng.

687
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,200
Sorry.

688
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,680
Yunqing?

689
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:36,870
Ling'er?

690
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,680
What are you doing here?

691
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,300
How do you know we are here?

692
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,570
Did you betray us?

693
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,510
What are you talking about?

694
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,440
That's not true.

695
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,410
Ling'er, how did you get out?

696
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,670
Didn't you enter the palace and become Consort Yue?

697
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,070
Who told you that?

698
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,120
I thought...

699
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,540
you truly wanted to marry my nephew.

700
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,510
I was upset about it all night.

701
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,570
That's not important.

702
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,840
I have something more important to do now.

703
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,970
You should go first.

704
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,010
I almost forgot.

705
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,310
I have something more important
to tell you.

706
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,640
Jiang Yunqing ran away.

707
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,610
What?

708
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:11,930
Oh no.

709
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,200
With Yunqing's temper,

710
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,530
she might storm back in.

711
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,100
General Dugu, what should we do?

712
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,610
The commander ordered us to wait here to assist him in leaving.

713
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,780
Let's stay calm and wait for his orders.

714
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,380
We must not disrupt his plan.

715
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,350
What?

716
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,350
Yue Chi is leaving?

717
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,610
That's not okay, is it?

718
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,410
What on earth is Consort Yue up to?

719
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,930
Once I kill Huo Jingheng,

720
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,160
I'll take you out of the palace with me.

721
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,610
Hurry up and go back.

722
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,510
The Empress Dowager is here today.

723
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,110
Even if Huo Jingheng steps in,
he won't be able to protect you.

724
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,860
I want to leave,

725
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,350
but I want to take you with me more.

726
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,350
Don't be foolish.

727
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,080
Consort Yue?

728
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,860
Where did you go, Consort Yue?

729
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,950
Your Grace!

730
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,440
Your Grace,

731
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,400
bed news!

732
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,750
His Majesty was ambushed

733
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,790
by an assassin in the Imperial Garden!

734
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,740
What?

735
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,440
Eunuch Wang.

736
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:38,880
Yes.

737
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,310
Hurry

738
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,110
and summon the imperial guards!

739
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,590
Yes!

740
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,360
This way!

741
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,440
Hurry, this way!

742
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,400
Surround the Imperial Garden!

743
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,060
-Yes!
-Yes!

744
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,250
Mother,

745
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,440
why are you here?

746
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,510
What do you think?

747
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,150
Hurry up and go after them!

748
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,440
Never mind, Mother.

749
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,480
The banquet is meant to be a joyful occasion.

750
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,739
Let's not let the assassin ruin our mood.

751
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,510
Let's put this matter behind us.

752
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,630
Put it behind us?

753
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,980
I think you're intentionally letting them go.

754
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,179
Over the years,

755
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,590
you've always been lenient with

756
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,670
the assassins who've infiltrated the palace.

757
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,870
The palace has become a fighting arena.

758
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,360
Have they shown any appreciation for your kindness?

759
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,420
Have they hesitated when swinging their swords at you?

760
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,800
I must take care of

761
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,280
this matter today.

762
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,840
Pass on my decree!

763
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,560
Lock down the palace gates!

764
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,210
Anyone who resists

765
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,650
will be killed without mercy!

766
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,360
Yes.

767
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,630
Those who harbor, protect,

768
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,380
or have connections with the assassin

769
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,440
will be punished equally!

770
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,030
Yes!
