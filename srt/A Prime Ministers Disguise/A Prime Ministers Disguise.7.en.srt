187
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,370
My former defeated opponent.

188
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,050
Your Highness knowingly breaks the law.

189
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,850
Do you want to establish new laws

190
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,720
or found a new dynasty?

191
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,370
Yue Chi,

192
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,670
you're slandering me!

193
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,920
Entering the capital without summons,

194
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,740
bringing weapons into the main hall,

195
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,680
relying on having fought alongside
His Majesty to conquer the realm,

196
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,650
flaunting your power,

197
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,170
and oppressing others with your authority.

198
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,430
Your Highness truly has great prestige.

199
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,680
I'm afraid Your Highness regrets choosing
to be merely a king back then.

200
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,480
What?

201
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Now you want to claim the throne here
in Fengyuan Hall?

202
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,920
I can see Man King has ulterior motives.

203
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,410
He definitely has other purposes.

204
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,530
Man King, I want to hear your
true thoughts.

205
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,170
Your Majesty.

206
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,870
I have absolutely no disloyal intentions.

207
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,010
I came to the capital this time only to

208
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,510
bring rare fruits and vegetables
from my territory

209
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,480
for Your Majesty's enjoyment.

210
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,400
That's why...

211
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,060
that's why I didn't report in time.

212
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,740
Now that the offerings have
been delivered,

213
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,260
would you like to stay and eat together?

214
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
I shall take my leave, Your Majesty.

215
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,770
Bestow vegetables and fruits
to all officials!

216
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,750
Eunuch Gui,

217
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,770
take Minister Wei back to his residence
to rest.

218
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,370
Go ahead.

219
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,010
Yes.

220
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,370
You,

221
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
come with me.

222
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

223
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,870
Just you two?

224
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,500
Not taking me along?

225
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,100
You're staying?

226
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:36,770
I'm staying.

227
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,410
You sure?

228
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,480
I'm sure.

229
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,890
Once you're on this ship,

230
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,220
it's not easy to get off.

231
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,770
Succeed, and we'll expand our territory.

232
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,820
Fail, and we'll be reduced to ashes.

233
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,010
Good.

234
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,250
From today on,

235
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,660
they will know

236
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,660
that you, Yue Chi, are about to become
the Right Prime Minister.

237
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,260
What does Your Majesty mean?

238
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,480
Engage in verbal battles with
the officials,

239
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,080
but stop short of bloodshed.

240
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,200
-Long live Your Majesty!
-Long live Your Majesty!

241
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,120
You may all rise.

242
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,250
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

243
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:27,930
Eunuch Gui,

244
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,560
read the decree.

245
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,560
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

246
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,440
We humbly beseech Your Majesty to
withdraw the edict.

247
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,480
Yue Chi is a traitor from the
previous dynasty.

248
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,540
How can he serve as the
Right Prime Minister of our Ning?

249
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,680
My dear minister, you may rise and speak.

250
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,540
If Your Majesty does not
withdraw the edict,

251
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,560
I shall remain kneeling here forever.

252
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,860
-Your Majesty, please withdraw your edict!
-Your Majesty, please withdraw your edict!

253
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,960
Have a debate with manners.

254
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,130
Start with me.

255
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,480
All of you esteemed ministers,
please stand up.

256
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,410
Why not rise and have a debate about

257
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,200
why I can't serve as
the Right Prime Minister?

258
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,440
A loyal subject serves only one master,
as has been the case since ancient times.

259
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,050
Rather than follow the noble example
of Bo Yi and Shu Qi,

260
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,130
you grovel before this court,
wagging your tail.

261
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,720
How shameless.

262
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,530
Since ancient times, heroes have never
been judged by their origins.

263
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,130
How can a sparrow comprehend

264
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,820
the soaring ambitions of a great swan?

265
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,320
Lord Ouyang, please rise.

266
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,450
To force the Emperor's hand with such
feminine theatrics—

267
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,650
is that the conduct of a true gentleman?

268
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,600
What did you say?

269
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,300
Who are you calling a woman?

270
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,000
Your Majesty!

271
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,200
As the saying goes, "Even a dying beast

272
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,560
can still bite."

273
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,800
Remnants of the former dynasty
are still at large.

274
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,080
The Right Prime Minister is a
crucial position in our court.

275
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,960
Yet this man before us has suspicions
of deliberately infiltrating

276
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,480
to attempt to restore the former dynasty!

277
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,160
Where's your evidence, Lord Zhang?

278
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,140
Without evidence, it's slander.

279
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,890
Officials should be truthful.

280
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,840
If all were like you, fabricating things
out of thin air,

281
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,560
our nation would be in peril.

282
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,010
It was the very act of trusting in slander

283
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,940
that led to the downfall of
the late emperor's reign.

284
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,600
And according to our laws,

285
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,600
those who falsely accuse others
without evidence...

286
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,360
shall be executed immediately.

287
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,720
Yue Chi is endowed with the talent
to manage state affairs.

288
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,250
That, we do not deny.

289
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,050
But as Lord Ouyang said,

290
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
he once served the previous dynasty

291
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,250
and now pledges loyalty to ours.

292
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,180
How can people possibly trust him?

293
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,090
Vice Minister Wang,

294
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:48,050
who do you think officials work for?

295
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,170
Your Majesty,

296
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,480
naturally for Your Majesty

297
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,210
and for the people of the realm.

298
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,170
Mencius said,

299
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,930
"The people are the most important,

300
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,310
the state comes next,

301
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,770
and the ruler is the least important."

302
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,290
This shows that the people are
the foundation of the nation.

303
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,250
I served the previous dynasty
for the people,

304
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,470
and now the people are still the people.

305
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,600
I am still serving this dynasty
for the people.

306
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,000
Lord Wang's concerns are
therefore unfounded.

307
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,740
You...

308
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,300
You...

309
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,480
Well said.

310
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,560
Well said, such unwavering conviction.

311
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,640
I

312
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,050
hope that all my ministers

313
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,830
can serve the people

314
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,520
with the same devotion
as Prime Minister Yue.

315
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,130
[Yongqian Palace]

316
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,300
It's not good that those officials
keep opposing.

317
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,780
Quickly think of a way to shut them up.

318
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
Stop drawing!

319
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,160
Stop drawing!

320
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,410
Stop drawing!

321
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
I really don't understand you scholars!

322
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,480
Don't disturb me.

323
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,210
I'm trying to think of a way.

324
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,569
I've got it.

325
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,440
Got it.

326
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,430
Mrs. Wang from Xinghua Alley,

327
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,710
Widow Li from Tianshui Alley, and...

328
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,130
Don't think you can make an official

329
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,119
like me yield with such nonsense!

330
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Where is this official you speak of?

331
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,680
I only see Scholar Cui, who has
repeatedly failed the imperial exams,

332
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,410
Escort Ma, who has lost all
his martial arts skills,

333
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,690
and the kind-hearted Boss Li.

334
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,370
Say, what if I accidentally told Mrs. Wang

335
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,700
that her sweetheart is
a first-rank court official?

336
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,890
Or told Widow Li

337
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,350
that her dear escort

338
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,400
is none other than Grand Secretary,
Lord Ouyang?

339
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,090
Or if I accidentally

340
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,300
told your fierce wife

341
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,090
that you, sir, spend every day
with young widows

342
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,350
with different identities,

343
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:56,960
well,

344
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,130
what should we do?

345
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,310
You can't tell them that.

346
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,630
What exactly do you want me to do?

347
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,850
Come to think of it...

348
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,270
you and I are actually relatives.

349
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,240
Your father's third sister's son

350
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,050
is a good friend of mine.

351
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,980
The last time we met...

352
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,840
I just remembered—

353
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,300
he was selling contraband salt
at the time.

354
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,510
I'm tired.

355
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,420
I know all about your wife

356
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,680
frequenting brothels and taking bribes.

357
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,880
So tell me, what should we do about this?

358
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,480
How is your son doing?

359
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,370
Last I heard, he ran someone over
on horseback in the Kangping District.

360
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,870
Did he hurt himself?

361
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,650
What do you all think?

362
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,710
I give up.

363
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,750
There's no other choice.

364
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,220
Let's end it while we can.

365
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,010
Do we really want to tarnish
our reputations in our later years?

366
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,150
It's a disgrace to us.

367
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,480
A disgrace.

368
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,910
Do any of you still have matters to raise?

369
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,200
If not, you may leave.

370
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,730
Your Majesty.

371
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,370
I... have a matter to report.

372
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,540
What do you want to say?

373
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,610
Last night, I couldn't sleep.

374
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,680
After much consideration,

375
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,480
I've decided to support Lord Yue
as the Right Prime Minister

376
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,170
to serve Your Majesty together
from now on.

377
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,660
I don't need you to serve me.

378
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,130
Your assistance will suffice.

379
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,440
What about the rest of you?

380
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,130
Do you have any objections
to Mr. Ouyang's words?

381
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,850
We humbly defer to
Your Majesty's decision.

382
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,370
Very well!

383
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,130
I'm very pleased to see that all of you

384
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,670
are so unanimous in your opinions.

385
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,240
However!

386
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,460
Lord Wei is ill and remains at home.

387
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,410
This morning, he sent a memorial

388
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,480
and asked me to deliver it personally
to Your Majesty.

389
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,030
Although we've cast aside our old grudges,

390
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,910
as a precaution,

391
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,090
we request that Lord Yue vow,

392
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,580
as Prime Minister,

393
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,000
never to employ the Qilin Army
or their designations.

394
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,440
Otherwise, it shall be considered treason,

395
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,040
and the entire Yue family will be forever
barred from holding office.

396
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,390
Otherwise, it shall be regarded as
an act of rebellion.

397
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:17,430
[Memorial]

398
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,210
If Lord Yue does not agree,

399
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,280
even if it costs me my life,

400
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,100
I cannot allow him to take office!

401
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,050
What?

402
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,810
Are you planning to spill blood
right here?

403
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,570
Go,

404
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,270
Eunuch Gui!

405
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,760
Pick a nice-looking pillar

406
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,370
for Minister Wei

407
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,090
so he may die for his country

408
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,520
with some dignity.

409
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

410
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,570
-Your Majesty, please reconsider!
-Your Majesty, please reconsider!

411
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,760
Your Majesty, please agree to Lord Wei's

412
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,460
and Lord Ouyang's request.

413
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,150
In life,

414
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,280
there are gains and losses.

415
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,510
Lord Wei's caution is reasonable.

416
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,370
I accept.

417
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,570
Forget it.

418
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,730
Do as you decide.

419
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,130
Thank you, Your Majesty.

420
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,170
Court dismissed!

421
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,700
-Respectfully seeing Your Majesty off.
-Respectfully seeing Your Majesty off.

422
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,130
Can I now

423
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,570
address you as the "Right Prime Minister"?

424
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,810
Left Prime Minister,

425
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,870
looking forward to working with you.

426
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,330
[Prime Minister's Mansion]

427
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,760
What?

428
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,570
We can't use the Qilin Army.

429
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,640
And our family's descendants
can't hold office?

430
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,040
Why don't they just say

431
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,960
we can't live in Ning at all?

432
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,240
They didn't say that.

433
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,550
But that's what they meant.

434
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,000
You're already being targeted.

435
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,920
I've always been targeted.

436
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,960
This isn't new.

437
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,490
No.

438
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,830
I have to help you.

439
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,520
You? Help me?

440
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,040
You couldn't even keep track of Yunqing.

441
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,610
How dare you bring that up?

442
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,460
It must be because you left
without saying goodbye

443
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,050
that Yunqing is mad at you.

444
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,440
Besides,

445
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,480
these are two different matters, okay?

446
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,610
You're in trouble now.

447
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,850
I must help you.

448
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,530
Okay.

449
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,520
Tell me then.

450
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,630
How do you want to help?

451
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,520
I want to enter the harem.

452
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,410
What did you say?

453
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,200
I said I want to enter the harem
to help you.

454
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,720
No way!

455
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,100
Why not?

456
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,130
The political dynamics at court

457
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,040
have completely changed since I became
the Prime Minister.

458
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,130
Cao Mang is also watching covetously
from the capital.

459
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,350
You can't take that risk.

460
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,170
Chi,

461
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,370
I'm also part of the Yue family.

462
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,490
Avoiding trouble when it arises

463
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,440
has never been the Yue family way.

464
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,410
Besides, I can't hide

465
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,640
behind you, seeking

466
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,140
your protection forever.

467
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,000
I need to do something for you too.

468
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,720
Ling'er.

469
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,090
This is not a game.

470
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,870
I never thought it was.

471
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,530
Think about it yourself.

472
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,810
Can you manage having Prime Minister Yue
and Consort Yue present at the same time?

473
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,030
Perhaps you can claim illness

474
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,760
for a while,

475
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,420
but what about in the long run?

476
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,000
Can you keep Consort Yue hidden forever?

477
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,810
Chi,

478
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,650
I must enter the harem.

479
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:40,990
Your Highness,

480
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,090
we're really not cut out for this game.

481
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,610
I really can't fly it.

482
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,870
I can see that.

483
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,540
So I...

484
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,930
really can only stay here

485
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
and am not allowed to go anywhere else?

486
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,680
Your Highness,

487
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,930
the imperial child you're carrying

488
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,200
is at a critical stage.

489
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,200
Moreover,

490
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,000
this is your first child
and the firstborn in the harem.

491
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,040
Do you know how many eyes
are watching you?

492
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,940
We absolutely cannot have any mishaps.

493
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,760
Acting like it's real.

494
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,810
What do you mean by "real"?

495
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,570
Ling'er!

496
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,440
Huo Jingheng.

497
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,410
This is madness.

498
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,330
Who let you come here?

499
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,930
Even mischief needs limits.

500
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,650
Does Yue Chi know about this?

501
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,570
He knows.

502
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,610
If nothing unexpected happens,

503
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,340
I'll be Consort Yue from now on.

504
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,440
What do you mean?

505
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,960
Yue Chi's only one man.

506
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,520
He can't be in two places at once.

507
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,040
He can't be in the court and the harem
at the same time.

508
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,330
How could he be so thoughtless?

509
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,000
My harem

510
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
is no less dangerous than the court.

511
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,650
This was my idea.

512
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,720
Your idea?

513
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,040
Even if I, Yue Ling'er,

514
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,650
were on the battlefield,

515
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,370
I'd be a heroine with a sword in hand.

516
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,440
This small harem is nothing.

517
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,410
Relax.

518
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,520
I've got this.

519
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:56,960
Really?

520
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,930
That impressive?

521
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,570
Of course.

522
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,940
However,

523
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,520
I can only stay in this Fengluan Palace

524
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,450
and can't go anywhere else to play?

525
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,370
You can't.

526
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,000
You're now the key protected person.

527
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:12,650
Fine.

528
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,000
But

529
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,170
I can have Eunuch Gui

530
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,850
buy all the novels from the market
for you.

531
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,370
That's not much fun.

532
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,810
I'll even have the authors brought in here

533
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,470
to customize stories for you.

534
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,170
How's that?

535
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,330
That's... okay.

536
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,550
I can grudgingly accept that.

537
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,030
[Elegant Dwelling with Spring Grace]

538
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,610
Your Majesty,

539
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,330
it's getting late.

540
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,230
Shall we rest early?

541
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,980
Consort Yue and that woman must have
a close relationship.

542
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,040
Eunuch Wang,

543
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,760
what do you think we should do

544
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,130
to make someone slip up?

545
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,440
When Heaven dooms a man,

546
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,210
it first makes him blind
with pride, Your Majesty!

547
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,140
Your Majesty...

548
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,050
Issue my decree,

549
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,720
saying that I've been unwell recently

550
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,260
and have Consort Yue

551
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,370
assist in managing the harem.

552
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
Understood.

553
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,000
Let me serve you.

554
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,660
Let's go to bed, Your Majesty.

555
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:43,960
What?

556
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,070
Assist in managing the harem?

557
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,930
Yes, Your Highness.

558
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,930
This morning, Eunuch Wang conveyed
the Empress Dowager's verbal order:

559
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,930
Consort Yue will temporarily manage
the affairs of the harem.

560
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,680
Good,

561
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,680
good.

562
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,030
Pregnant,

563
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,440
enjoying His Majesty's favor,

564
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,610
and now even managing the harem affairs!

565
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,650
Please don't be angry, Your Highness.

566
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,200
That Consort Yue obviously doesn't have
what it takes.

567
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,660
Sooner or later, these duties will
fall back to Your Highness.

568
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,410
No way.

569
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,870
[Consort Yue shall, for the time being,
oversee the affairs of the harem]

570
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,870
Let's go.

571
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,720
Let's see how this new leader of
the harem is doing.

572
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,130
I'd like to see for myself

573
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,960
how she plans to make a strong start.

574
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,520
Yes, Your Highness.

575
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,200
Let's go!

576
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,610
Yue,

577
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,080
let's hurry and find His Majesty

578
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,240
and have him persuade the Empress Dowager
to retract the decree.

579
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,190
I'm not cut out to manage the harem.

580
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,650
Wait, Your Highness.

581
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,440
Don't you think the Empress Dowager
knows your abilities?

582
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,650
Even if she doesn't know you're not
cut out for this,

583
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,890
now that you're pregnant,

584
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,650
the Empress Dowager still insists on
giving you this responsibility—

585
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,980
that means she's already made up her mind.

586
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,960
What should I do then?

587
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,290
Should I just accept it?

588
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,570
No.

589
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,590
Right.

590
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,370
I can turn to my brother.

591
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,440
My brother will surely know what to do.

592
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:14,970
Let's go.

593
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,070
Your Highness.

594
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:18,960
Your Highness,

595
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,360
Consort Hui has arrived.

596
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,720
You may go.

597
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,890
Yes, Your Highness.

598
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,010
Consort Hui has come.

599
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,820
Your Highness?

600
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:30,890
Your Highness...

601
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,440
Where is Consort Yue?

602
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,670
Your Highness.

603
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,000
What?

604
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,570
You're Consort Yue?

605
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,200
I wouldn't dare, Your Highness.

606
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,440
It's just that Her Highness is pregnant

607
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,890
and is not feeling very well.

608
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,660
Your Highness, please return.

609
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,000
After all, it would be a great offense

610
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,440
to disturb the imperial child.

611
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,850
So she's too frail to see me,

612
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,660
yet not too frail to manage
the entire harem?

613
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:53,370
What?

614
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,960
I'm a curse to her?

615
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,640
Your Highness, you jest.

616
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,070
It's inconvenient for Her Highness
to see you at this time.

617
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,610
She can dodge me today,

618
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,330
but she can't avoid me forever.

619
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,200
I have all the time in the world!

620
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,720
You're amazing.

621
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,000
Your Highness,

622
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,460
you could literally scare someone
to death!

623
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,000
Did you hear that?

624
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:24,910
You could dodge her today,

625
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,370
but you can't avoid her forever.

626
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,130
Now that you're in charge of the harem,

627
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,460
sooner or later, you'll have to face them.

628
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,440
But the moment I show my face,

629
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,900
won't it just...

630
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:43,730
[Memorial]

631
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,040
[Former county magistrate of Liaocheng abused his power, refused to return
temple lands to farmers, and many unresolved issues are left]

632
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,370
This is about the handover of
local officials in Liaocheng.

633
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,330
It's said that the former official
oppressed the people

634
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,590
and refused to return the damaged
temple land to farmland.

635
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,330
This can barely be considered
a proper matter.

636
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,050
And then, there's this.

637
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,570
[Mengxu House's madam claims the top girl
faked her death and stole her contract]

638
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,350
The mama of the capital's
largest brothel is suing

639
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,800
the top courtesan for faking death
by jumping into the river

640
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,040
and stealing her indenture contract.

641
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,240
She wants the Court of Review to help
investigate the courtesan's whereabouts.

642
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,090
And this one.

643
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,820
A group of 13- to 14-year-old boys

644
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,550
formed a street gang to extort
protection money.

645
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,340
All of these.

646
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,370
Do you want to see

647
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,870
what I deal with every day?

648
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,840
Give it back.

649
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,310
Put it back.

650
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,680
You've already eaten one.

651
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,450
Hurry up.

652
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,850
There's still a mountain left to review.

653
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,570
Speed up, okay?

654
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,920
Your Highness, don't frown so much.

655
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,520
Come on.

656
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,810
Have some grapes.

657
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,260
They're sweet and sour.

658
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,450
Congratulations, Consort Yue.

659
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,650
Today, His Majesty wants you to
attend him tonight.

660
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,670
Please prepare yourself

661
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,160
and follow me quickly.

662
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,040
What?

663
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,140
Your Majesty.

664
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,850
Consort Yue has arrived.

665
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,580
Consort Yue stays.

666
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,680
The rest of you may leave.

667
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

668
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,460
Your Majesty.

669
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,650
Why has Your Majesty summoned me here?

670
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,520
Why are you standing so far away from me?

671
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
Come here to talk.

672
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,780
No need, no need.

673
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,180
I can hear you just fine from here.

674
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,390
Didn't you

675
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,120
send Yue to tell me

676
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,240
that you had something to discuss?

677
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,170
And asked me to beg Mother?

678
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,240
You mean about that matter?

679
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,140
I...

680
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,970
The Empress Dowager asked me to assist
in managing the harem.

681
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,760
I am aware of this.

682
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,410
Whatever she asks you to do,

683
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,410
just do it for now.

684
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,320
But I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

685
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,010
If you don't know what to do,

686
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,770
just observe for now.

687
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,930
This palace

688
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:20,410
is like a massive sailing ship
in full operation.

689
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,810
Planks and beams,

690
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,280
rivets and sails—

691
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,760
every part has its own logic

692
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,090
and patterns to follow.

693
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,000
You don't need to deliberately do anything

694
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,200
or break anything.

695
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,410
You just need to observe—

696
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,850
see what this ship still needs you to do.

697
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,280
Just observe?

698
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,480
Just observe.

699
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,040
But remember,

700
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,610
while you're observing everything,

701
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,940
someone is also watching you from behind.

702
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,310
You mean the Empress Dowager?

703
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,570
Let's eat first.

704
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,460
Eating is more important
than anything else.

705
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,450
His Majesty has been going

706
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,180
to Consort Yue's palace for
seven straight days.

707
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,090
Before,

708
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,090
he'd occasionally drop by my palace
for a bit,

709
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:12,930
but now

710
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,090
I can't even catch a glimpse
of His Majesty.

711
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,290
His Majesty used to be cold to everyone,

712
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,570
but ever since Consort Yue
came into the palace,

713
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,760
his attitude has changed dramatically.

714
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,620
It's mainly because of the child.

715
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,330
Consort Yue already has His Majesty's
deep favor,

716
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,760
and now she's pregnant,

717
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,090
yet she's still hogging His Majesty's
attention.

718
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,950
How are we supposed to explain this
to our families?

719
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,570
I don't think

720
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,520
she will be happy for long.

721
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,770
Sisters,

722
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,330
I won!

723
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,810
Pay up, pay up!

724
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,280
Hurry!

725
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,770
How did you win again?

726
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,570
I've been giving you money all afternoon.

727
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,520
Can't help it. I'm on a lucky streak.

728
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,050
Come on.

729
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,520
I can't afford to keep playing with you.

730
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,240
Let's play another round.

731
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,410
I've already lost half of
my monthly allowance.

732
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,610
I'm done playing too.

733
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,340
Me neither.

734
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,030
I'm off. I'm done playing.

735
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:08,710
Your Highness,

736
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,010
what do you plan to do?

737
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,020
Follow my sworn brother's arrangements.

738
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,929
That's truly inhumane!

739
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,730
Rumors can't be trusted, okay?

740
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,480
His Majesty and I

741
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,600
are allies.

742
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,230
Dining buddies, you know?

743
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,080
That guy,

744
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,929
he's usually frugal and thrifty.

745
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,389
He can't bear to waste so much food
every day.

746
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,520
Anyway, right now

747
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,600
I have no plans to stay in the palace
long-term.

748
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,440
But what if His Majesty

749
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,330
develops feelings for you over time?

750
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,730
Sharing meals with someone every day

751
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,440
builds the strongest kind of dependency.

752
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,770
Once it becomes a habit,

753
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,330
are you going to spend

754
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,000
the rest of your life in this harem?

755
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,530
You're being too dramatic.

756
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,820
You don't understand.

757
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,250
Men understand men best.

758
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,810
If he visits you daily,

759
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,600
he's bound to develop feelings for you
over time.

760
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,160
Fine,

761
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,410
what do you suggest we do?

762
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,630
I think

763
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,010
we should let him

764
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
spend more time with the other consorts.

765
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
He is the emperor.

766
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,090
This is only proper for him to do so.

767
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,840
That's true.

768
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,120
Then... what's your plan?

769
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,440
You're really something.
