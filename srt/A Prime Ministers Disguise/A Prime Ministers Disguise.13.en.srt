[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,710
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,870
Come down.

4
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,400
Climbing so high,

5
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,660
be careful not to fall.

6
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,510
Why don't you ask me

7
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,700
why I skipped school today?

8
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,230
Your teacher has a leg injury.

9
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,220
It rained last night,

10
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,870
so today he's surely

11
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,530
in too much pain to leave home.

12
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,789
You're indeed meticulous in thinking!

13
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:38,450
No wonder you could keep this from me for so long!

14
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,310
Run!

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,340
Not so easily!

16
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,979
Let me explain.

17
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,070
You kept saying

18
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,250
that you had nothing to hide from me.

19
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,039
Is this what you call

20
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,370
having nothing to hide?

21
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,660
Yunshuo has no intention of restoring the old regime.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,280
Then why did you let him run?

23
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,200
Commander, we have a problem.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Young Master Jiang has been kidnapped.

25
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:06,950
Just now.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,150
The kidnapper's martial arts skills were exceptional.

27
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,060
Judging by his moves and accessories,

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,720
he seemed to be a palace guard.

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,850
Huo Jingheng!

30
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,240
Give me back my brother.

31
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,840
When did I ever take him?

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,430
Yue Chi,

33
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,860
what does this mean?

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,460
I'm trying to save you.

35
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,030
Do you think

36
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,450
you could really harm him?

37
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,800
Besides, I trust His Majesty.

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,630
Shuo was definitely not kidnapped by him.

39
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,280
Why?

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,050
If it was really a palace guard,

41
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,800
how could he leave His Majesty unprotected?

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,400
The most important thing now

43
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,710
is to find Shuo.

44
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,780
If anything happens to Shuo,

45
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,870
I will not let this go.

46
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,600
Your Majesty, please forgive her.

47
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,150
I humbly request Your Majesty to dispatch

48
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,030
palace guards

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,340
to assist me.

50
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,230
Assist you with what?

51
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,630
Treason?

52
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,000
Prime Minister Yue,

53
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,960
Seems you've truly taken me

54
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,590
for a puppet

55
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,430
to be manipulated at your will.

56
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,360
I wouldn't dare.

57
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,590
I know Your Majesty is a benevolent ruler.

58
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,930
What you saw today

59
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,310
was nothing more than a teenage

60
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,510
boy with a slingshot.

61
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,100
Your Majesty,

62
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,360
a farmer reported that

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,290
around 5-7 PM,

64
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,520
he saw three or four suspicious-looking men

65
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,550
[Zuoshun Gate]

66
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,750
taking a child into the deep mountains.

67
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,400
Shuo!

68
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,330
-That child is similar to Young Master Jiang.
-Shuo!

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,610
Shuo!

70
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,310
Shuo!

71
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,200
Yue Chi,

72
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,100
let's split up.

73
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,190
You search the mountain,

74
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,519
while I'll go with His Majesty.

75
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,649
It's dark and raining heavily.

76
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,290
I'm afraid he's only seenShuo once

77
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,890
and might not recognize him.

78
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,020
Shuo's safety is paramount.

79
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,710
Shuo!

80
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,120
Yunshuo!

81
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,680
Yunshuo!

82
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,040
Yunshuo!

83
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,690
It's Shuo's slingshot.

84
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,260
Let's split up and search.

85
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,390
Split up and search!

86
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,270
-Yes!
-Yes!

87
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,890
Shuo!

88
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,470
Shuo!

89
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,870
Shuo!

90
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,560
Young Master Jiang.

91
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,830
Shuo!

92
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,200
Sister, Brother Chi!

93
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,600
Help me!

94
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,320
Shuo!

95
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:33,930
Your Majesty,

96
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,180
I speak on behalf of Yunshuo.

97
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,960
Thank you for saving his life.

98
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,140
No need.

99
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,500
Your Majesty, please allow me to explain

100
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,770
everything.

101
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm tired.

102
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,140
If you have anything to report, submit a memorial.

103
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,320
I'm guilty

104
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,670
of deception,

105
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,490
Your Majesty.

106
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,780
After the Qilin Army found Shuo back then,

107
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,230
I have been taking care of him.

108
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,400
He reads, writes,

109
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,100
just like any other child.

110
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
I only wish for him to grow up safely.

111
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,450
He also wishes to live a quiet life among commoners.

112
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,030
I know I've committed the crime of deception,

113
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,210
and I dare not ask for forgiveness.

114
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,930
Please punish me as you see fit.

115
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,100
I only hope that Your Majesty treat Yunshuo

116
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,950
as if he never existed.

117
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,570
Commander.

118
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,250
His Majesty

119
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,220
is both laughing and shaking his head.

120
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,680
Did he agree to this or not?

121
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,060
You're staying?

122
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,550
I'm staying.

123
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,270
You sure?

124
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,740
I'm sure.

125
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,160
Succeed,

126
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,300
and we'll expand our territory.

127
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,240
Fail,

128
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,260
and we'll be reduced to ashes.

129
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,230
Entering the capital without summons.

130
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,880
Bringing weapons into the main hall.

131
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,960
I'm afraid Your Highness regrets

132
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,750
only becoming a prince back then.

133
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,750
Now you want to claim the throne here in Fengyuan Hall?

134
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,130
Yue Chi,

135
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,080
I like your spirit.

136
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,650
Once you start something, you see it through.

137
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,240
For these new policies

138
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,490
and new methods,

139
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,170
no matter the dynasty,

140
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,510
someone must dare to propose them

141
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,840
in the court first.

142
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,320
From today on,

143
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,840
between you and me,

144
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,860
there will be no more secrets.

145
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,040
Huo Jingheng was absolutely

146
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,960
certain Yunshuo was the Crown Prince.

147
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,790
Is this what you call

148
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,890
having nothing to hide?

149
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,660
Who told him about this?

150
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,490
Why did he suddenly come?

151
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,850
And those bandits—

152
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,210
how did they arrive so conveniently,

153
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,700
kidnapping Yunshuo

154
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,620
without taking money or hurting anyone,

155
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,680
without even leaving a guard behind?

156
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,970
Who's really

157
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,850
behind this?

158
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,900
It's Shuo's slingshot.

159
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,470
Yi Qingyun.

160
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,410
Jiang Yunqing went to rescue

161
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,450
Jiang Yunshuo on her own,

162
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,610
ruining your plan.

163
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,640
If she isn't punished,

164
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,740
I'm afraid she'll

165
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,170
only grow more reckless.

166
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,190
Jiang Yunqing has been

167
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,680
secretly visiting Jiang Yunshuo for years.

168
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,230
She cares deeply

169
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,920
about her brother.

170
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,120
But if she could figure out

171
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,750
where Jiang Yunshuo was,

172
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,440
she must have known

173
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,870
I did it intentionally.

174
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,770
Yet she still dared to interfere.

175
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,130
It seems

176
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,150
we can't use this incident

177
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,080
to drive a wedge between the Regent and Huo Jingheng.

178
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,750
Jiang Yunqing.

179
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,880
Fine.

180
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,980
There are three days

181
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,130
left this month.

182
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,680
Left.

183
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,690
Left.

184
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,830
To the left.

185
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,350
Hand it over.

186
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,960
What did I say?

187
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,440
Prime Minister Yue

188
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,940
definitely wouldn't go to Yongqian Palace.

189
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
You won.

190
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,340
[Yongqian Palace]

191
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,580
Your Majesty.

192
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,990
Where is he?

193
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,740
He hasn't come.

194
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,450
He probably went back.

195
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,640
He went home?

196
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,480
Well, well.

197
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,290
[Yongqian Palace]

198
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,220
Is he trying to show defiance to me?

199
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,310
If I don't agree to his demands,

200
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,030
is he planning to retire

201
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,030
and live in peace?

202
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,850
Oh, you meant the Right Prime Minister?

203
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,730
He had an appointment with Lord Liu.

204
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,610
I thought

205
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,090
you meant the Imperial Uncle.

206
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,180
Why would I ask about that fool?

207
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,360
Go.

208
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,840
Tell the imperial physician to prescribe him

209
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,900
a month of bed rest.

210
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Yes.

211
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,530
Your Majesty,

212
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,220
the Imperial Uncle only showed up

213
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,490
because he felt bad

214
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,770
everyone was avoiding

215
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,170
Consort Yue's new wine.

216
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,730
To Consort Yue, he's at most

217
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,950
just a confidant.

218
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,000
Fine.

219
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,590
Let him be.

220
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,350
A confidant is no big deal.

221
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,750
Who doesn't have one?

222
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,630
I have plenty.

223
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,970
Just the other day,

224
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,420
that embroidery girl—

225
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,170
what...

226
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,860
what's her name again?

227
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,840
Xia Yunshuang.

228
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,410
Yes.

229
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,470
Let's go to her palace.

230
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,050
Yes.

231
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,450
Setting off.

232
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:12,750
His Majesty has arrived!

233
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,370
[Excellent and Virtuous]

234
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,120
[Excellent and Virtuous]

235
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,240
Your Majesty,

236
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,440
Her Highness went to

237
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,470
play the zither with Consort Hui.

238
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,610
Let's go.

239
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,570
[Yongqian Palace]

240
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,710
[Yanning Palace]

241
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,730
Your Majesty,

242
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,720
Her Highness went to

243
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,120
went to play chess with Jr. Concubine Zhao.

244
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,030
[Yongqian Palace]

245
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,170
Your Majesty,

[Graceful and Proper]

Her Highness

248
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,860
went to play the flute

249
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,050
with Lady Lan.

[Yongqian Palace]

251
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,840
Your Majesty,

252
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,630
shall we try

253
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,040
another palace?

254
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,480
Where is everyone?

255
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,250
Where have they all gone?

256
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,320
Here I come!

257
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,320
I win!

258
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,810
I'm the dealer this round—

259
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,000
everyone pay up.

260
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,190
Hurry up.

261
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,390

262
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,980
Come on!

263
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,650
I have plenty of confidants.

264
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,550
Today,

265
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,200
I must get

266

Xia Yunshuang's

267
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,200
hairpin.

268
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,730

270
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,270
and right eye lines.

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,430
Left eye dots,

272
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,370
and right eye lines.

[Auspice and Blessing]

274
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,510
Got it, left eye...

275
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,630
What...

276
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,980
What are you doing here?

277
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,530
Just because of that?

278
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,890
Isn't that going too far?

279
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,220
I've been lowering myself.

280
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,600
Even went to the Imperial Lake

281
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
to catch ducks.

282
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,910
I've never worked this hard to please a girl.

283
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,790
But him?

284
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,050
Always defending those sisters.

285
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,910
The three of them

286
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,120
are like a family.

287
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,570
And I'm the outsider now.

288
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,370
So what now?

289
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,960
Sounds like

290
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,550
my son's sincere

291
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,080
heart has been

292
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,110
all in

293
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,670
vain.

294
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,030
Mother.

295
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,390
That boy Yue Chi,

296
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,910
I've met him before.

297
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,360
I feel that I have

298
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,160
a certain understanding of him.

299
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,910
It's not that I'm

300
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,360
speaking in his favor.

301
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,480
I think this child

302
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,840
is quite good.

303
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,550
Don't you think?

304
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,320
He must

305
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,000
have his own reasons.

306
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,120
You're determined to stay

307
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,450
glued to this position.

308
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,630
But him?

309
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,690
He doesn't need to.

310
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,110
How about this one?

311
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,210
Too small.

312
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,200
Right?

313
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,840
Well,

314
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,390
as for how Yue Chi has been as the Prime Minister,

315
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,320
I won't ask,

316
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,720
nor am I interested.

317
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,240
He doesn't need

318
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
to tell me who he's hiding.

319
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,440
However,

320
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,240
as the Emperor,

321
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,150
you need

322
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,670
someone to assist you.

323
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,080
I think this child

324
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,720
is not after wealth

325
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,550
or fame.

326
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,440
He's a good person, isn't he?

327
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,670
Since you've chosen to use him,

328
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
don't waver.

329
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,790
Trust the ones you use,

330
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,650
and don't use the ones you doubt.

331
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,540
Right?

332
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,370
This one is big enough, Your Grace.

333
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,430
This is good.

334
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,420
It's enough.

335
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm just afraid

336
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,960
he's also being kept in the dark.

337
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,820
Can't tell who truly

338
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,070
cares for him.

339
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,000
All these years,

340
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,840
he's been used

341
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
without knowing.

342
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,900
You need to use sincerity

343
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,900
to exchange for sincerity.

344
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,610
Right?

345
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,440
Rest assured,

346
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,910
he won't let you down.

347
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,460
Let's go.

348
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,660
Let's go confiscate.

349
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,720
Who's the target this time?

350
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,890
The Fengluan Palace?

351
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,870
Do we need to

352
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,790
give Ling'er a heads up?

353
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,530
No need.

354
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,390
That girl

355
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,710
is quite clever.

356
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,360
Let's go.

357
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,960
Setting off.

358
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,030
Sir,

359
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,260
I've always followed your orders.

360
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,190
Now,

361
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,460
Yue Chi and Huo Jingheng

362
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,700
are divided.

363
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,460
Please give me the antidote.

364
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,790
The division between them

365
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,230
was thanks to you, Jiang Yunqing.

366
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,410
I was foolish

367
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,150
and couldn't

368
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,900
understand your intentions.

369
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,790
I was desperate to save my brother.

370
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,650
Please show mercy, Sir.

371
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,160
Since you said

372
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,900
you didn't understand my intentions,

373
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,690
you shouldn't have brought those two

374
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,760
to rescue your brother.

375
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,150
But you figured out

376
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,359
where I had placed your brother

377
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,690
and took them to rescue him.

378
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,460
How bold of you.

379
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,990
I was just worried

380
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,349
that even if we couldn't find Yunshuo,

381
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:26,910
Yue Chi

382
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,920
might not necessarily think it was

383
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,320
Huo Jingheng who hid him.

384
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,070
I was just worried about Yunshuo,

385
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,220
Sir.

386
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,270
If I didn't think Jiang Yunshuo

387
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,270
is still useful,

388
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,890
he'd be dead already.

389
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,390
In that case,

390
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,070
where would you go to find him?

391
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,580
Sir.

392
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,380
It seems you haven't learned your lesson yet.

393
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,430
Sir.

394
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,930
Sir.

395
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,220
I beg you.

396
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,000
Sir.

397
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,560
Sir!

398
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,000
Thank you, Sir.

399
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,240
Don't let it happen again.

400
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,370
Xue Jingguan.

401
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,600
What did you say?

402
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,470
The newly appointed Princess Changping of Ning Dynasty

403
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,520
is the former Empress's person.

404
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,780
It's absolutely true.

405
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,020
Impossible.

406
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,220
Jiang Yunqing's body

407
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,940
was taken back to Li.

408
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,170
She died long ago.

409
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,350
Could it be...

410
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,750
Shadow,

411
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
we're heading to Ning State.

412
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,080
What are you going there for, Your Highness?

413
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,310
To pluck a fruit—

414
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,020
an unexpected one

415
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,950
that just ripened.

416
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,990
My Lord.

417
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,850
As per your instructions,

418
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,730
the Man King has been sent to Qi City.

419
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,070
Just as you predicted,

420
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,360
the rain in Qi City is getting heavier.

421
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,040
Tell the Man King

422
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,300
to proceed with the plan in two days.

423
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,940
The rain in Qi City

424
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,990
is not heavy enough yet.

425
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,960
Yes.

426
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,960
I've heard

427
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,650
Consort Yue's new wine

428
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,160
is winning everyone over today.

429
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,700
What a timing.

430
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,980
I finally had a good hand—

431
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,070
and he shows up.

432
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,350
What bad luck.

433
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,180
Lust, gambling, and drugs.

434
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,260
The Fengluan Palace has two of the three vices.

435
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,540
The days are long.

436
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,430
We're just looking for some fun.

437
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,720
If I don't punish you,

438
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,180
it won't be enough to uphold palace rules.

439
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,040
Your Majesty, please spare us.

440
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,980
I truly know my mistake.

441
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,990
All gambling funds will be confiscated.

442
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,850
All of you,

443
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,130
go back and reflect on your actions.

444
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,330
Thank you for your mercy, Your Majesty.

445
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,420
Isn't this a bit not good?

446
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,640
What's not good about it?

447
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,050
Is it the quality

448
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,350
or the appearance?

449
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,330
It's the reputation.

450
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,470
Isn't this entrapment

451
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,020
and cheating their money?

452
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,530
Reputation?

453
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Why should I fear

454
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,010
a bad reputation?

455
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,270
It's almost done.

456
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,810
Your Grace,

457
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,530
look, it's almost full.

458
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:06,750
Alright,

459
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,350
then,

460
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,340
what else is

461
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,110
not packed?

462
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,780
The Guanyin statue for fertility.

463
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,870
This Guanyin...

464
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,670
I won't be needing it anymore.

465
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,690
Let me take a look.

466
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,590
However,

467
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,100
the appearance is indeed...

468
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,800
You may have it.

469
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,280
Thank you, Mother.

470
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,460
It's been quite fruitful.

471
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,460
Eunuch Wang,

472
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,840
we'll be going then.

473
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,660
Let's go.

474
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,380
Take care, Mother.

475
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,090
Mother gave it to you.

476
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,240
You don't want it?

477
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,260
Thank you for Your Majesty's gift.

478
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,840
I have no use for it either.

479
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,760
-You...
-I...

480
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,290
Why did they all come

481
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,590
to play cards in your chamber?

482
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,350
Well, it's just that

483
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,150
everyone's usually quite idle.

484
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,110
So we have to do

485
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,590
something interesting.

486
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,350
As for the Empress Dowager,

487
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,310
she's suffered quite a few losses lately.

488
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,350
When she lost again just now,

489
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,240
her temper flared up.

490
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,600
It's understandable.

491
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,390
The Empress Dowager is really

492
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,730
nasty.

493
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,460
You didn't lose anything, did you?

494
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,290
No.

495
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,440
Mother left everything for me.

496
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:36,770
Oh, right.

497
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,790
I wanted to ask

498
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,920
if Tianzhao...

499
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,870
"Uncle."

500
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,870
You should call him "Uncle."

501
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,220
Fine.

502
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,690
How is Uncle Tianzhao

503
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,810
doing?

504
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,550
The imperial physician said

505
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,260
he still needed to rest in bed

506
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,310
for about a month.

507
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,440
Are you that worried about him?

508
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,130
Do you want to see him that badly?

509
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,660
Can't even wait for a month?

510
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,600
He'll be fine in just a month.

511
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,400
Can you ask the imperial physician

512
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,530
to treat him for three months instead?

513
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,640
Or else,

514
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,250
you could give some of my brother's work

515
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,250
to him.

516
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,070
My brother

517
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,310
is so busy that I barely

518
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,330
see him these days.

519
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,330
But Du Tianzhao is so idle,

520
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,170
just playing with cats and dogs all day.

521
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,200
It's truly annoying.

522
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,330
I can't stand it.

523
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,440
If you don't want to see Du Tianzhao,

524
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,680
then why,

525
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,230
every time he shows up again and again,

526
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,160
do I never see you turning him away?

527
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,620
Your Majesty,

528
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,800
think about it yourself.

529
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,180
Du Tianzhao

530
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,070
comes from the Empress Dowager's palace,

531
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,920
asking for something
on behalf of the Empress Dowager,

532
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,030
or delivering something for her.

533
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,090
He's the Imperial Uncle.

534
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,750
Who among us dares to stop him?

535
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,560
Why don't you

536
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,800
ask my brother to come over?

537
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,640
Once he's here,

538
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,240
he'll surely drive him away.

539
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,550
How could I arrange

540
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,050
your brother's schedule?

541
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,450
It's always your brother arranging mine.

542
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,480
One moment he asks me to pretend to be deaf,

543
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,920
the next to be mute.

544
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,800
He even just asked me to act blind.

545
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,240
Your Majesty is still angry

546
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,970
with my brother, isn't that so?

547
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,800
Do you know

548
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,040
your brother

549
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,090
has been taking care of

550
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,330
Jiang Yunshuo recently?

551
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,210
Jiang Yunshuo?

552
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,000
What happened to that little brat?

553
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,290
Did he get into a fight
or cause trouble at school?

554
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,870
So you do know.

555
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,510
Why is it that

556
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,240
you two never say anything

557
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,720
unless I ask?

558
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,470
I trust him so much,

559
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,400
yet he hides things so meticulously.

560
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,480
Would I make things difficult for

561
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,440
a child who can't even

562
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,700
pull back a slingshot?

563
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,140
It's infuriating.

564
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,870
You sound like

565
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,160
you just caught

566
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,110
your husband with a kid

567
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,260
from his side fling.

568
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,270
How dare you!

569
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,960
I am not a jealous woman!

570
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,490
I am the Emperor,

571
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,660
the Son of Heaven.

572
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,650
I even made Yue Chi the Prime Minister.

573
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,210
How could I be petty?

574
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:00,790
Alright.

575
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,470
Alright then.

576
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,030
Let's sit down and talk.

577
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,200
Anyway,

578
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,760
I've heard of the saying

579
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,920
that a prime minister
should have a heart as vast as the sea,

580
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,180
but I've never heard of

581
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,500
that being going the same for an emperor.

582
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,440
Your Majesty,

583
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,750
if you truly have

584
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,160
a broad-minded heart,

585
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,910
you should quickly reconcile
with my brother.

586
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,920
My brother's

587
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,310
always busy,

588
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,840
yet you

589
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,550
always seem to be avoiding him.

590
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,890
I'm not avoiding him at all.

591
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,590
I'm just busy with state affairs,

592
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,010
and we happen to miss each other.

593
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,880
And also,

594
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,500
I'm not avoiding you either.

595
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,500
I've had Eunuch Gui

596
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,290
invite you for meals

597
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,290
several times,

598
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,370
but you never came.

599
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,720
Oh, you.

600
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,610
Don't miss it next time, alright?

601
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,760
Got it.

602
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,730
It's just a meal.

603
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,130
Look how scared you are.

604
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,310
Got it.

605
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,660
I promise.

606
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,550
Eunuch Gui.

607
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,070
I'm here.

608
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,510
Summon Yue Chi

609
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,670
to the Fengluan Palace to see me.

610
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,680
Go now.

611
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,850
Oh, Your Majesty.

612
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,150
Why are you back again?

613
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,940
The palace gate guards have just

614
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,620
reported:

615
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,700
Yi Qingyun, Crown Prince of Li State,

616
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,960
is visiting our state.

617
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,120
He is currently at the palace gate,

618
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,380
awaiting an audience.

619
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,160
Oh?

620
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,050
What a coincidence.

621
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,900
Alright.

622
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,270
I'll meet the Crown Prince of Li State

623
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,220
in the Fengyuan Hall.

624
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,810
Go tell Prime Minister Yue that

625
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,120
he no longer needs to
come to Fengluan Palace.

626
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,450
Instead, instruct him
to go straight to Fengyuan Hall.

627
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,070
Yes.

628
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,070
The Crown Prince of Li State

629
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,250
has disrupted a family reunion.

630
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,880
It sounds like

631
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,010
he's not a good person.

632
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,640
[Benevolence and People First]

633
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,600
By Your Majesty's summons,

634
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,890
I have arrived, though belatedly.

635
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,840
It's alright.

636
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,860
The Crown Prince mentioned

637
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,520
that you were acquaintances.

638
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,710
So I

639
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,520
called you here to catch up.

640
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,830
We're not exactly acquaintances.

641
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,980
It's just that I

642
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,690
have met the Crown Prince

643
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,310
once before.

644
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,240
If what Prime Minister Yue said is true,

645
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,870
the Crown Prince

646
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,730
should have already arrived
at the capital long ago.

647
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,960
Why didn't Your Highness

648
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,980
come to see me immediately?

649
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,780
Your Majesty,

650
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,800
the scenery of Ning

651
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,890
is truly beautiful.

652
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,380
I was momentarily captivated

653
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,830
and lingered for a few days.

654
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,770
I was in the process of

655
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,240
apprehending a wanted criminal.

656
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,120
The Crown Prince and his guards
were in a hurry

657
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,180
and even had a confrontation with me.

658
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,130
I am aware of my frail health.

659
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,090
Shortly after entering the city,

660
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:22,750
I witnessed

661
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,700
a large-scale pursuit and arrest.

662
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,960
At that time, I didn't know

663
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,490
who Prime Minister Yue was.

664
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,310
In a moment of urgency, my guards

665
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,040
confronted Prime Minister Yue

666
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,990
to protect my safety.

667
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,700
It was truly a misunderstanding.

668
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
I was on an important mission at the time.

669
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,720
If I have offended Your Highness,

670
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,390
I ask for your forgiveness.

671
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,640
You were diligently performing your duties.

672
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,360
There's no question of offense.

673
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,790
But I later set up

674
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,280
several layers of defense around the area,

675
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,440
intercepting carriages
without proper documentation.

676
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,970
How is it that Your Highness

677
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,000
disappeared without a trace?

678
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,100
It's all because of my weak constitution.

679
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,670
I fell ill

680
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,120
and found a nearby household

681
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,750
to recuperate for a few days.

682
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,480
I apologize for the trouble
caused to Prime Minister Yue.

683
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,370
Well,

684
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,340
on the day Your Highness
arrived in the capital,

685
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,660
did you really not see

686
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,520
any suspicious individuals?

687
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,010
I

688
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,210
don't mean to distrust Your Highness.

689
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,510
It's just that

690
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,800
for every day

691
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,370
the fugitive remains at large,

692
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,410
the city faces

693
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,160
one more hidden threat.

694
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,150
Your Highness has come from afar.

695
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,400
If something were to truly go wrong,

696
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,120
I

697
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,570
would feel deeply troubled.

698
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,790
Your Majesty,

699
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,280
do I look like someone
who would harbor criminals?

700
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,810
His Majesty is merely concerned
that the criminal

701
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,400
might accidentally harm Your Highness.

702
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,530
He never mentioned the word "harbor."

703
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,730
Your Highness is being oversensitive.

704
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Then it seems I have misunderstood.

705
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,680
I am well aware

706
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,870
of my frail and declining health.

707
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,490
That makes me unfit
for great responsibilities.

708
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,490
It is only because I am my father's

709
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,920
sole remaining bloodline

710
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,510
that I have been reluctantly

711
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,180
entrusted with the Crown Prince's seal.

712
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,080
Since there are criminals causing chaos,

713
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,320
I humbly request Your Majesty

714
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,530
to station additional personnel
at the posthouses,

715
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,700
so as to prevent misunderstandings

716
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,930
and preserve the harmony
between our two nations.

717
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,890
Eunuch Gui,

718
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,740
see the guest out.

719
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

720
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,950
Please.

721
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:26,890
Your Majesty,

722
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,550
I saw it clearly at the time.

723
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,910
The person in the intercepted carriage

724
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,050
must be him.

725
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,740
Cao Mang was inside?

726
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,030
The curtain blocked the view,

727
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,490
but I'm almost certain.

728
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,180
Then send someone to follow him.

729
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,080
He wants to prove his innocence.

730
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,660
Then we

731
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,830
shall see

732
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,240
what this Crown Prince

733
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,190
is up to.

734
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,020
We once

735
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,620
went our separate ways.

736
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,010
It's fate.

737
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,310
It is fate indeed.

738
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,750
And life is full of surprises.

739
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,580
Life is unpredictable,

740
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,710
but we shape our own destiny.

741
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,850
I, Yue Chi, will not let Your Majesty down.

742
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,500
Then I shall not disappoint you either.

743
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,810
The road ahead is long.

744
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,840
Let's move forward.

745
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,410
So he's waiting for me here.

746
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,030
Your Highness,

747
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,050
why haven't you left the city yet?

748
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,730
You may have forgotten.

749
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,060
I grew up

750
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,620
in the Ning Palace

751
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,200
for five whole years.

752
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,310
Now as I walk,

753
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,030
it's inevitable to feel nostalgic

754
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,160
and recall the past.

755
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,510
This scenery of Ning

756
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,840
remains unchanged,

757
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,590
but the people

758
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,690
are not who they once were.

759
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,310
However,

760
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,490
though Ning State has changed rulers,

761
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,800
Prime Minister Yue

762
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,030
is still the same Prime Minister Yue.

763
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,690
When I assisted the previous dynasty,

764
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,850
I had no interaction with Your Highness.

765
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,010
A few days ago,

766
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,110
I first saw your esteemed face.

767
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,230
You and I

768
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,520
were never truly acquainted.

769
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,480
When it comes to human connection,

770
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,070
it's not about

771
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,620
how often we meet,

772
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,940
but whether our hearts

773
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,430
are in tune.

774
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,810
If I hadn't entered Ning as a hostage,

775
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,460
I wouldn't have been able to read

776
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,320
"Outline of the New Governance."

777
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,790
In your book, you

778
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,570
mentioned those iron-fisted measures.

779
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,370
I learned a great deal from them.

780
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,160
But I never wrote anything

781
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,310
in the book

782
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,830
about stirring up the court

783
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,240
or killing my own blood relatives—

784
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,440
such words as disloyalty,
unfilialness, and injustice.

785
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,980
I'll take it that you're

786
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,750
praising my strong methods.

787
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,740
Today, I,

788
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,450
have specially prepared a little something.

789
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,820
I know you

790
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,910
have an extremely beloved sister.

791
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,250
So I specially sought a crane bone fan

792
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,890
for Consort Yue.

793
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,270
The fan handle

794
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,620
is made from the leg bone of a crane

795
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,810
from Baihe Mountain in my country,

796
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,110
with a texture as smooth as jade.

797
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,400
It's a pity.

798
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,830
My sister has a straightforward personality

799
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,900
and doesn't like ordinary women's

800
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,900
playthings.

801
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,140
Thank you for your thoughtfulness,
Your Highness.

802
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:52,890
No worries.

803
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,180
How about this?

804
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,270
This is...

805
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,360
That's right.

806
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,350
The long-lost

807
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,370
Pingsha Biluo Dagger.

808
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:10,840
Can I...

809
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,000
touch it?

810
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,000
Of course.

811
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,739
Are you sure

812
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,190
Yue Chi accepted the item
from the Crown Prince of Li State?

813
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,500
I saw it with my own eyes.

814
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,949
Prime Minister Yue was holding
the treasured dagger with both hands,

815
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,590
admiring it for a long time.

816
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,670
This is a trivial matter.

817
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,989
Yue Chi should manage it with ease.

818
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,880
Let him accept it.

819
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,070
Maybe in a couple of days,

820
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,440
he'll send it to me.

821
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,630
Yi Qingyun

822
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,750
is truly audacious.

823
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,440
Wei Zhang.

824
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,699
I'm here.

825
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,469
Keep a close eye on him.

826
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,159
If there's any movement,

827
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,409
report to me

828
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,590
immediately.

829
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

830
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,480
Shuo.

831
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,400
Yue.

832
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,510
Yue, why are you here?

833
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,210
I'm here to take you home.

834
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:10,990
Home?

835
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,100
What home?

836
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,020
Back to the Yue Mansion.

837
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,840
I'm right here!

838
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:21,910
Shuo, run quickly!

839
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,240
His Majesty has granted permission.

840
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,540
From today onwards,

841
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,030
Shuo doesn't have to leave anymore.

842
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,490
You two siblings

843
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,320
can stay here with peace of mind.

844
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,510
No matter where we are,

845
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,690
I just want to always

846
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,860
stay by his side,

847
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,910
protecting him for his entire life.

848
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,290
Yunqing,

849
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,490
what are you worried about?

850
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,820
Indeed.

851
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,670
Shuo carries the bloodline

852
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,130
of the former royal family

853
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,320
But victory and defeat

854
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,370
are the outcomes for those
who enter the game.

855
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,230
When the country fell,

856
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,390
he was still young.

857
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,390
He never participated in state affairs.

858
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,880
Now, can't he even

859
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,940
live a normal life?

860
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,870
All these years, I've sent him to study,

861
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,270
taught him martial arts,

862
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,140
and broadened his knowledge.

863
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,900
He has grown up well.

864
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,390
You are his only family.

865
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,150
Now that you

866
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,880
have also returned to his side,

867
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,100
his life is complete.

868
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,810
Yunqing,

869
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,090
though I don't know

870
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,490
what you've been through

871
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,410
to come back,

872
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,530
but the day we reunited at the palace,

873
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,630
I was truly happy.

874
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,230
We have already paid

875
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,840
enough for the past.

876
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,620
Now I just want to

877
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,750
start

878
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,320
a new life

879
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,670
with you, Shuo,

880
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,510
and Ling'er.

881
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,780
Think about it carefully.

882
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,550
Prime Minister Yue, you've arrived.

883
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,690
Why have you come at this hour?

884
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,550
The Crown Prince

885
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,190
sent an envoy to my mansion

886
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,410
without His Majesty's permission.

887
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,880
Isn't that a breach of protocol?

888
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,010
Prime Minister Yue,

889
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,980
the Crown Prince strictly
adheres to etiquette.

890
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,190
That's why he specially ordered me

891
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,450
to visit on his behalf.

892
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,180
His Highness said

893
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,150
that the Pingsha Biluo Dagger

894
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,550
he gifted to you last time

895
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,360
was declined by you.

896
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,700
He thought it might not be to your liking.

897
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,260
So,

898
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,590
His Highness specially ordered people

899
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,990
to find some other treasures.

900
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,650
He insisted that you must
accept them this time.

901
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,800
These are too valuable.

902
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,150
How can I accept them?

903
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,000
Prime Minister Yue,

904
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,550
Young Master Dugu beside you

905
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,210
just said the same thing.

906
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,560
His Highness said

907
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,630
you may choose

908
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,110
whatever you like.

909
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,320
If there's nothing you like,

910
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,550
just throw them all

911
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,650
out of the mansion.

912
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,080
Our prince is in poor health

913
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,110
and cannot fully appreciate
such an array of weapons.

914
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,910
These items

915
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,030
have only one place to go,

916
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,670
which is your mansion.

917
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,320
No wonder he looked so displeased earlier.

918
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,740
How could we possibly discard them?

919
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,640
Sir, please take these treasures

920
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,640
back with you.

921
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,590
Prime Minister Yue,

922
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,250
you're putting me in a difficult position.

923
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,130
If I were the one to say such things,

924
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,810
the prince wouldn't listen.

925
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,830
So, you're saying...

926
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,400
If you

927
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,820
spoke to him personally,

928
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,490
the prince who respects you

929
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,430
would surely not put you
in a difficult position.

930
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:39,960
Alright.

931
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,630
Where has your prince arranged

932
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,760
to meet me?

933
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,480
If Your Highness wants to see me,

934
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,460
just say it outright.

935
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,840
Taking such a long roundabout way,

936
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,110
are you trying to pin the label

937
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,440
of disloyalty on me too?

938
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:21,320
The treasure chests

939
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
have already crossed half the city.

940
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,700
If you accept it,

941
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,480
it looks like a secret deal;

942
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,850
If you refuse, it would be seen as
an insult to the foreign envoy.

943
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,880
If I didn't put you

944
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,320
in a dilemma,

945
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,440
how else would you

946
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,840
come to see me so easily?

947
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,650
At worst, I could send all these boxes

948
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,060
to the palace

949
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,790
to show some loyalty.

950
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,740
That's true.

951
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,850
Then why didn't you do it?

952
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,700
If it wasn't done that way,

953
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,050
there is surely a reason for that.

954
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,440
Perhaps you fear that even if you send them,

955
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,320
it won't prove your loyalty,

956
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,810
and the recipient might not even be pleased.

957
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,600
It's better to return them directly,

958
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,730
clean and decisive.

959
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,910
Your Highness, please speak your mind.

960
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,810
Yue Chi,

961
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,830
I want you to come with me to Li State

962
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,590
and serve as the Prime Minister there.
