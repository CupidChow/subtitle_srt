[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,890
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,120
Are you sure it was Consort Yue
who asked for me?

4
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,590
Absolutely.

5
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,050
Strange.

6
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,030
It doesn't seem right.

7
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,150
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

8
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,039
We're already here.

9
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,890
Let's go in and take a look.

10
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,590
Yes.

11
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,200
Ling'er?

12
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,940
Who is this?

13
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,009
Lady Lan?

14
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,020
Your Majesty,

15
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,500
you're finally here!

16
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,180
Please, have a seat.

17
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,240
Why are you here?

18
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm here to wait for you
to have tea with me.

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,720
Oh, right.

20
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,050
I also brought a flute.

21
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,030
Hold off on the flute for now.

22
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,890
I'm asking why you're here waiting for me.

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,170
You may not be aware,

24
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,480
but Consort Yue has auctioned you off.

25
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,360
Auctioned?

26
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,680
Yes.

27
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,330
Having a meal with you
costs 50 taels of silver.

28
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,490
Composing poetry with you costs 20 taels.

29
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,490
Not just that—

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,870
there are custom packages too.

31
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,829
As long as you can afford it,

32
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,790
Consort Yue can arrange anything.

33
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,760
How much did you pay?

34
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:25,770
Me?

35
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,780
Ten taels for having tea,

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,720
plus five for a flute performance—

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,780
15 taels in total.

38
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,530
I'm only worth 15 taels?

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,750
No, no, that's not it,

40
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,520
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,870
You're pretty expensive.

42
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,430
Just half an hour of tea with you

43
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,520
costs 10 taels.

44
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,870
If it goes over two hours,

45
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,190
the price doubles.

46
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,940
Eunuch Gui.

47
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,950
-Yes.
-Go.

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,860
Take her to get 50 taels.

49
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,079
No need, no need,

50
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,579
Your Majesty.

51
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,630
I don't need money.

52
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:57,870
I...

53
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,710
Never mind.

54
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,160
I'll return it to you.

55
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,870
I'll return it to you later.

56
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,400
Let's go!

57
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,200
You said it was Consort Yue?

58
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,990
You conspired to deceive me!

59
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,970
Fengluan Palace indeed said
it was Consort Yue.

60
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,830
I was just passing on the message.

61
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,810
Your Majesty,

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,680
Lord Wei came to request
an audience again.

63
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,150
He's waiting outside Yongqian Palace.

64
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,150
What audience? I won't see him.

65
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,280
What is there to see?

66
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,090
It's the same thing.

67
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,850
He wants to persuade me

68
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,710
to remove Yue Chi from his post.

69
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,800
That day, when Yue Chi was announced
as Prime Minister,

70
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,480
Wei Zi'ang wasn't there.

71
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,490
It must be the greatest regret of his life.

72
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,550
Otherwise, he would have definitely

73
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,570
bumped into one of the pillars
in Fengyuan Hall.

74
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,820
Let's go!

75
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,150
[Yongqian Palace]

76
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,840
What's wrong?

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,710
Why do you give me that look
as soon as I come?

78
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,310
I'm not giving you that look.

79
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,160
Look at this.

80
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,390
Five memorials.

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,680
They are Wei Zi'ang's
10,000-word petitions.

82
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,280
He wants me

83
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,440
to turn you into a figurehead
Prime Minister.

84
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,840
Isn't that good?

85
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,769
So I'd just need to collect my salary.

86
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,160
Dream on.

87
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,240
Governing a great nation
is like cooking a small fish.

88
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,390
The court is like a small world.

89
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:37,620
Whether the emperor listens to advice
isn't really the point.

90
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,890
Taking a step forward might win
people's hearts;

91
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,740
taking a step back

92
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,720
might leave no way back.

93
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,440
Endure when you must,

94
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
but you also need to act decisively.

95
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,370
So,

96
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,440
the right people

97
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,040
must be in the right positions.

98
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,250
I'll let Wei Zi'ang

99
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,610
say whatever he wants.

100
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,750
He's an honest official.

101
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,470
I won't make things difficult for him.

102
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,510
But I

103
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,950
won't be restrained

104
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,060
just because he's honest.

105
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,640
To lead a family, you sometimes

106
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,100
have to play deaf and dumb.

107
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,300
If you make things too clear, it might

108
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,520
make things difficult
for your subordinates.

109
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,350
[Memorial from Wang Shiling,
Vice Minister of Rites]

110
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,650
[Your Majesty, there is a shortage of capable officials in Ning. The imperial examination threshold should be lowered, and greater emphasis should be placed on selecting talent, promoting capable individuals without rigid constraints.]

111
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,930
Is this whole stack memorials

112
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,390
from the ministers
that strongly oppose it?

113
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,560
Yes.

114
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,760
Lowering land taxes and prioritizing
talent selection

115
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,360
are all good for Ning Dynasty
—from commoners to officials.

116
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,560
Why do they oppose it?

117
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,840
Because you're challenging
the ancestral rules.

118
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,630
People need to look forward.

119
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,640
If you cling to outdated traditions
all day,

120
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,790
what great things can you accomplish?

121
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,580
Nothing.

122
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,750
So we need to wait.

123
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,350
They need time to adapt.

124
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,710
Wait?

125
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,880
With their stubborn minds,

126
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,980
they won't accept it even by the time
I'm in my grave.

127
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,820
So,

128
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,930
I'm just going to do it.

129
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,140
Unless they kill me

130
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,260
and replace me as the Prime Minister.

131
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,260
Yue Chi,

132
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,890
I like your spirit.

133
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,450
Once you start something,
you see it through.

134
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,640
New policies and methods,

135
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,530
no matter the dynasty,

136
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,250
always need someone who dares

137
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,630
to be the first to propose them in court.

138
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,830
They need someone who dares to

139
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,120
lead and get things done no matter what.

140
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,670
It's clear that the common people
are the foundation of the country.

141
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,000
Today, the common people
are still the common people.

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,070
I'm still working for them.

143
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,320
That is why

144
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,440
I summoned you to serve in the court.

145
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,780
Am I that important?

146
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,570
That's why I want to reward you.

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,970
It is not right

148
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,890
to accept gifts here, is it?

149
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,040
Come.

150
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,680
-Put it here. I'll carry it in...
-I plan to...

151
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
reward you with a trip to Yangcheng.

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,330
And while you're there,

153
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,090
help the new local official

154
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,630
and give him some advice.

155
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,840
He comes from a humble background.

156
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,550
Don't let the old hands bully him.

157
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,310
I knew your smile meant trouble.

158
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,040
Well, I married such a good Consort Yue.

159
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,630
She can handle formal occasions

160
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,230
and also work in the kitchen.

161
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,430
From now on,

162
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,290
all I will have left are smiles.

163
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,490
Get lost.

164
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,320
On horseback.

165
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,070
Then I'll entrust all this to you.

166
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,530
Try your best.

167
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,990
I, Ouyang Wen, hereby submit a memorial
reporting that the Right Prime Minister

168
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,270
has overstepped his authority

169
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,560
by publicly beating the son
of a powerful noble,

170
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,100
putting the Court of Review
in a difficult position.

171
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,600
Your Majesty, please punish...

172
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,270
The Right Prime Minister publicly
punished a man who forcibly took a woman,

173
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,920
which is truly a model of our court's
rituals and etiquette.

174
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,080
I will certainly reward
the Right Prime Minister generously.

175
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,930
Also, I order Minister of Rites Ouyang Wen
to carefully copy

176
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,630
Outline of the New Governance authored
by Prime Minister Yue...

177
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,510
Eunuch Gui,

178
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,040
go to the Ministry of Rites' gate

179
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,030
and loudly recite my official reply.

180
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
Make sure your voice is loud and clear.

181
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,570
Your Majesty...

182
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,480
is that really necessary?

183
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,929
I'll reward you with half a month's salary
when you return.

184
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,030
Your Majesty, rest assured.

185
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,390
I will complete the task perfectly!

186
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,670
Li, Xuan,

187
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,080
Rui, Gu,

188
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,160
come with me!

189
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,430
You may all leave now.

190
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,240
Where did Eunuch Gui go?

191
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,520
He went to deliver a gift to Mr. Ouyang.

192
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,150
Why are you here?

193
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,710
My brother said he beat the second son

194
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,250
of the Grand Secretary in public today.

195
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,500
He must have been reported.

196
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,570
So I came to check.

197
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,630
Why do you seem not worried at all?

198
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,240
He is not worried,

199
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,370
and I am even less so.

200
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,170
Also, my brother has been targeted
frequently lately.

201
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,870
We think it must be because
he hit on someone's sore spot.

202
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,540
This is actually a good thing.

203
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,160
What about me?

204
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,870
Why don't you think I would be angry?

205
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,440
You are angry about
my brother's situation,

206
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,840
and I appreciate that.

207
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,750
I'm talking about you auctioning me off.

208
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,890
Oh, so that's what you mean?

209
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,380
Don't be too happy.

210
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,460
What?

211
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,480
I've already looked into it.

212
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Although some concubines are daughters
of Former Ning officials,

213
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,510
their families are still quite wealthy.

214
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,230
You see,

215
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,580
they receive their monthly stipends
but have nowhere to spend them,

216
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,390
while you

217
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,480
have plenty of free time
with nothing to do.

218
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,320
It's making the best use of resources.

219
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,800
Of course, I won't embezzle any
of that money.

220
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,180
Give me your hand.

221
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,670
As the saying goes,
"it all comes out of the same pocket."

222
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,390
Since the stipends for concubines

223
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,030
come from the state treasury,

224
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,580
the money should naturally
go back to the treasury.

225
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,440
I'm giving you a money pouch.

226
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,190
How is that?

227
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,830
Isn't this a good idea?

228
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,770
It is.

229
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,850
But don't do this again.

230
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,030
Why?

231
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,900
I don't like it.

232
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,600
I don't understand you.

233
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,360
The Right Prime Minister hit the target!

234
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,720
Chi, amazing!

235
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,750
Right Prime Minister won!

236
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,790
Prime Minister Yue, your archery skills
are impressive.

237
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,580
With Your Majesty as my example,

238
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,840
how could I not do well?

239
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,250
You weren't going easy on me just now,
were you?

240
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,580
How could I?

241
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,680
You weren't so hesitant back in the day.

242
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,470
I should practice more.

243
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,570
My nephew is really not what he used to be.

244
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,240
You should compete with me one day.

245
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,120
Maybe I'll win easily too.

246
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,150
I advise you to spend

247
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,910
an hour practicing every day.

248
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,810
You need to protect yourself
when you're outside.

249
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,780
Exactly.

250
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,360
If an assassin comes one day,

251
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,160
you might not even be able to run.

252
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,280
Uncle, don't you have something else
to do?

253
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,410
I don't have anything to do.

254
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,610
Then go do your thing—

255
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,610
while I still call you "Uncle".

256
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,580
This guy.

257
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,540
Just seeing him annoys me.

258
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,710
What's wrong, Ling'er?

259
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,520
Why are you so quiet?

260
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,950
It's about the women in the harem.

261
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,310
Even if I tell you,

262
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,750
will you understand?

263
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,340
How could I not understand?

264
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,100
I am the ruler of a nation.

265
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,000
The ruler of a nation who just
lost a match.

266
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,790
Well, even the ruler of a nation

267
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,190
can't be undefeated in everything, right?

268
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,190
Tell me about it.

269
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,770
I might have a solution.

270
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,040
That's true.

271
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,720
After all, Chi once competed
to be the Empress

272
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,840
and was once Your Majesty's
favorite consort.

273
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,260
You must have a way.

274
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,630
You didn't have to say that.

275
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,350
I think what Ling'er said makes sense.

276
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,090
You didn't have to say that either.

277
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,000
Alright.

278
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,140
Let's get back to the main topic.

279
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,970
Your Majesty, didn't you ask me
to observe the palace?

280
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,790
I've been observing for the past few days,

281
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,860
and I've found that

282
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,560
the lives of the concubines in the palace

283
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,560
are extremely dull and monotonous.

284
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,580
At first,

285
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,510
I thought of auctioning him off

286
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,150
to give everyone a bit of fun

287
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,210
and maybe earn a little money from it.

288
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,630
But

289
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,790
he didn't agree.

290
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,050
I am the ruler of a nation.

291
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,530
You've said that already.

292
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,490
And not many people are interested anyway.

293
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,080
Like Consort Hui and the others.

294
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
It's completely beyond my expectations.

295
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,160
I thought that everyone in the palace

296
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,270
was focused entirely on winning favor.

297
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,030
I thought everyone liked His Majesty

298
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,080
and wanted to get his attention.

299
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,060
You see, as the Prime Minister,

300
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,540
I handle state affairs

301
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,980
and receive a monthly salary.

302
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,440
The concubines are the same.

303
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,940
They help Your Majesty maintain
connections with their families

304
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,510
and receive a monthly salary too.

305
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,200
Not all the concubines

306
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,850
in the harem like His Majesty.

307
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,150
They get close to him

308
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,200
and follow him everywhere

309
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,250
because that is what

310
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,960
they're supposed to do in the palace.

311
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,210
It's their job as royal concubines.

312
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,910
Their job?

313
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,870
I am the Emperor.

314
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,400
And you two keep saying

315
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,550
they don't like me.

316
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,450
Isn't that a bit rude?

317
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,490
So, you want to find something
for the concubines to do,

318
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,010
right?

319
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,710
Yes.

320
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,870
What kind of things?

321
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,320
I haven't found anything

322
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,910
specific yet.

323
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,570
But life in the harem is so predictable,

324
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,830
like you can see right through to the end.

325
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,310
Women confined to their chambers,

326
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,860
households,

327
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,810
or the palace

328
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,200
may seem different,

329
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,670
but actually, they are all the same woman.

330
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,920
Sometimes,

331
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,870
when I see them,

332
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,720
I feel quite lucky.

333
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,030
I've experienced hardships,

334
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,960
escaped,

335
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,260
entered the palace,

336
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,800
and even escaped from it.

337
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,740
Although I've faced many difficulties,

338
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,460
every day has been different.

339
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,630
Chi,

340
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,930
you just compared yourself to them,

341
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,910
but it's actually very different.

342
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,270
All along,

343
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,960
men have had

344
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,690
many more choices than women.

345
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,500
Even if you don't take the Emperor's salary,

346
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,740
you can still take the salary

347
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,880
from an academy or a restaurant.

348
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,270
And your life experience is always growing.

349
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,960
The book of your life

350
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,520
is always getting thicker.

351
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,190
Whether it's a big academy or a small one,

352
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,310
a big restaurant or a small one,

353
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,170
the things you've done

354
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,770
will always be recognized.

355
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,970
But in a woman's lifetime,

356
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,200
how many things can she do

357
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,750
that truly benefit herself?

358
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,340
Ling'er,

359
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,280
you think too much.

360
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,590
The truth is that women have thought
too little all along.

361
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,100
Your intentions are good.

362
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,580
There's nothing wrong with striving
for your own life.

363
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,930
But everyone can only solve problems

364
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,490
in the situation they are in.

365
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,030
Actually, these concubines have all been

366
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,810
carefully taught by their noble families.

367
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,830
They are educated and well-mannered,

368
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,080
skilled in singing and dancing.

369
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,710
Each has her own specialty,

370
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,360
but maybe nowhere to show it.

371
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,490
So, Chi, what do you mean?

372
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,610
You can set up a department system
in the harem,

373
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,560
where the concubines

374
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,320
take on duties according to

375
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,510
their talents and interests,

376
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,250
helping them achieve their own careers

377
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,870
and broaden the meaning of their lives.

378
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,030
What the women in the palace eat,

379
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,150
use, and do

380
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,950
is always imitated outside.

381
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,600
This might have a far-reaching influence.

382
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,970
That sounds like a feasible plan.

383
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,040
Chi,

384
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,750
you really do have the knack for this.

385
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,880
No wonder you were once His Majesty's
favorite consort.

386
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,060
You guys keep talking.

387
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,570
I'll get to work now.

388
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,980
You're really something.

389
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,510
I just gave her a direction.

390
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:31,950
Your Highness.

391
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,750
Your Highness, look at that person.

392
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,000
Isn't that...

393
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,030
I'm going to Fengluan Palace.

394
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,470
You go back first.

395
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,360
I've heard that you come from
a military family.

396
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,000
You must be the only one
who knows martial arts.

397
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,910
This is clearly a concubine's
embroidered shoe,

398
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,520
but it's huge.

399
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,470
Who else could wear it besides
Concubine Yue?

400
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,510
The other day I ate too much
stimulating food

401
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,640
and broke out in a rash all over my face.

402
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,990
Plus, I was born plain.

403
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,069
I feared frightening Your Majesty
and His Majesty.

404
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,880
Especially you, Prime Minister,

405
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,680
a once-in-a-decade genius.

406
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,920
You figured out that Consort Yue
is pregnant?

407
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,990
His Majesty said...

408
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,350
It's true.

409
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,170
Trying to pull a switcheroo on me?

410
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,020
That brat.

411
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,270
If I don't teach him a lesson,

412
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,350
he'll never know my power to intimidate.

413
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,880
Please, Your Majesty, calm your anger.

414
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,670
The Emperor is leaving the palace tomorrow
morning to review the troops, right?

415
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,630
Yes.

416
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,090
This time, I'd like to see
who will save you.

417
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,750
[Zuoshun Gate]

418
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,820
Prime Minister Yue.

419
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,310
Prime Minister Yue.

420
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,040
Eunuch Wang.

421
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,780
I'm here by the Empress Dowager's

422
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,600
command to deliver a message.

423
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,880
She wishes for you

424
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,110
to visit Shoukang Palace

425
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,190
after you're off duty.

426
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,720
This doesn't bode well.

427
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,250
No.

428
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,680
Huo Jingheng is not here today,

429
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,240
and I don't know
the Empress Dowager's intentions.

430
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,670
I should lay low

431
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,750
and wait until Huo Jingheng returns.

432
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,490
Search thoroughly!

433
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,590
Your Majesty,

434
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,240
I've already informed Prime Minister Yue.

435
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,770
Alright, keep an eye on him.

436
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,670
This is Your Majesty's command.

437
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,530
He wouldn't dare to run.

438
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,780
You never know.

439
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,560
His backer is returning in a few days.

440
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,280
[Fengluan Palace]

441
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,440
It would be better with less sugar.

442
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,490
Your Highness,

443
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,670
it's chaos out there.

444
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,840
You must not go out.

445
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,510
Okay.

446
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,900
I heard a man has broken into the harem.

447
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,270
The guards sent by the Empress Dowager

448
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,200
are searching everywhere for him.

449
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,680
A man?

450
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,440
Who dared to sneak into the harem
in the middle of the night?

451
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,240
Exactly.

452
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,090
You're the man?

453
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,920
Ling'er,

454
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,710
I need to hide here for a while.

455
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,620
Chi,

456
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,010
is there enough time?

457
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,720
The Empress Dowager will probably
search here soon.

458
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,830
Today she suddenly summoned me

459
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,960
and deliberately chose the day His Majesty
left the palace to review the troops.

460
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,110
She definitely won't let me off easily.

461
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,450
I can only try to bluff my way through.

462
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,030
Du Tianzhao?

463
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:27,920
I...

464
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,950
I can help.

465
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,020
Du Tianzhao,

466
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,770
since when did you learn
to climb through windows too?

467
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,540
Ling'er,

468
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,470
I heard the news

469
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,930
and rushed over to warn you.

470
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,510
Her Majesty is already
on her way to your palace—

471
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,970
she'll be here any moment.

472
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,590
Your Highness,

473
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,790
Her Majesty is here.

474
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,910
Your timing with this news is impeccable.

475
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,620
Chi,

476
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,550
don't worry.

477
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,170
I've thought of a solution.

478
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,270
Come out.

479
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,490
Come out!

480
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,840
Sister?

481
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,950
You actually caught me

482
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,980
in such an embarrassing situation.

483
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,780
How come it's you?

484
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,270
Why did you come to Fengluan Palace

485
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,720
acting...

486
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,110
all sneaky?

487
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,880
What are you up to?

488
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,340
Sister,

489
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,240
let me be frank today.

490
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,630
You've been pushing me to get married,

491
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,220
and I kept putting it off on purpose

492
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,590
because I already have someone I like.

493
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,340
That person is...

494
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,270
Left Prime Minister.

495
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,480
Please, Sister, give us your blessing.

496
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,240
Pretend you didn't see what
happened today.

497
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,310
My feelings for Meili

498
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,440
are sincere and pure.

499
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,520
If she dies,

500
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,670
I won't go on living either!

501
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,880
Meili?

502
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,110
Then let her die!

503
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
What's your name?

504
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,450
Meili?

505
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,890
A name that suits her well.

506
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,620
She's as beautiful as her name.

507
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,620
Impressive.

508
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,840
Where is Consort Yue?

509
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,250
Where is Consort Yue?

510
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,110
Your Grace,

511
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,400
Consort Yue

512
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,330
just took the calming medicine
prescribed by the imperial physician

513
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,860
and is sleeping soundly
behind the curtains.

514
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,720
This is a disgraceful matter.

515
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,420
Let's not trouble Consort Yue with this.

516
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,490
If she finds out,

517
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,910
she'll surely punish Meili.

518
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,170
But none of this has anything
to do with her.

519
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,900
I alone will take responsibility
for my actions.

520
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,450
His Majesty is here!

521
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,530
He sure runs fast.

522
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,150
What's all the noise?

523
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,740
Such a romantic scene.

524
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,960
No wonder I heard all the noise

525
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,830
as soon as I entered the palace.

526
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,960
It turns out you're the one
causing trouble.

527
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,750
You really disregard palace rules,

528
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,010
disrupting the harem.

529
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,920
What?

530
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,160
What's your problem?

531
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,510
In the dead of night,

532
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,640
you trespassed into a concubine's chamber
to secretly meet a palace maid.

533
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,560
And you still won't admit your guilt?

534
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,550
I do, I do.

535
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,290
As long as you don't punish Meili,

536
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,090
I'll admit it.

537
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,380
Mother,

538
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,980
please deal with this as you see fit.

539
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,660
Very well.

540
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,870
Since an outsider entered the
harem today...

541
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,570
It's me!

542
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,350
It is me.

543
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,110
You admitted it quite quickly.

544
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,040
Don't you have anything to say?

545
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,670
Nothing at all.

546
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,160
Fine.

547
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,940
Reward him...

548
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,720
Reward him with 20 strokes of the paddle!

549
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,700
As you command.

550
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,850
Sister!

551
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,670
Imperial Uncle,

552
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
this way, please.

553
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,690
Take care of yourself.

554
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,840
Everyone else is following a script,

555
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,530
and you're the only fool

556
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,090
who didn't get one

557
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,960
and wasn't supposed to perform.

558
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,560
You just had to jump in
and get yourself beaten.

559
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,920
Remember,

560
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,270
hit him hard!

561
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,400
Come on, come on.

562
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,070
Get up.

563
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,880
Do you think he'll really get
into trouble?

564
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,370
Don't worry.

565
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,750
He's experienced.

566
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,310
Mother wouldn't bear

567
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,260
to hurt her precious younger brother.

568
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,960
This is not a place to stay long.

569
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,660
Later,

570
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,700
I'll have Wei Zhang quietly
escort you out.

571
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,270
Okay.

572
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,400
I'll leave.

573
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,600
I'll leave in a hurry.

574
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,000
Prime Minister,

575
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,340
the exit is just ahead.

576
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,510
I'll see you off here.

577
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,040
Farewell, Prime Minister.

578
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,950
If you don't know what to say, you don't
have to say anything.

579
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,270
This is his eye.

580
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,590
This is his head.

581
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,750
Hit him!

582
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,310
Stop now.

583
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,210
Lift him up.

584
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,370
Don't you want to run away?

585
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,040
I dare not.

586
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,210
Your Majesty is just waiting for me to run

587
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,100
so you can take me on.

588
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,680
A fine man

589
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,390
shouldn't cower in fear like that!

590
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,100
All these weapons are here

591
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,200
for you to choose from.

592
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,680
You dared to go to the battlefield,

593
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,010
so don't tell me you're afraid to
fight me.

594
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,040
The problem is that I can't
beat you anyway.

595
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,320
Answer my question!

596
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,310
On the battlefield,

597
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,220
I was a general

598
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,110
and had no choice but to fight.

599
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,370
But now, officially,

600
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,290
I am an official of Ning.

601
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,000
How could I fight the Empress Dowager?

602
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,370
So by your logic,

603
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,640
I'm acting out of personal interest?

604
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,640
Officially,

605
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,880
I am an official serving His Majesty.

606
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,750
Personally,

607
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,750
His Majesty and I were comrades-in-arms.

608
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,430
Whether officially or personally,

609
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,290
I cannot go against you.

610
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,900
Tell me,

611
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,620
what's really going on?

612
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,210
You played a trick in the harem,

613
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,590
and Consort Yue turned into
Prime Minister Yue.

614
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,930
Are we all just your audience
in the Imperial Garden?

615
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,000
Is it fun?

616
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,720
Your Majesty,

617
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,760
all this happened because of
my momentary recklessness.

618
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,460
Back then, His Majesty summoned
Ling'er into the palace to serve him.

619
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,190
Ling'er is innocent by nature.

620
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,550
I worried that she would have no support
entering the palace abruptly.

621
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,080
I was also concerned that

622
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,260
His Majesty might trouble
her because of the past.

623
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,160
So in a moment of folly,

624
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,290
I decided to disguise myself as a woman

625
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,960
and entered the palace on her behalf.

626
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,560
You're quite honest, aren't you?

627
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,740
But after entering the palace,

628
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,330
I saw that His Majesty works
tirelessly day and night,

629
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,110
diligently governing and
caring for the people,

630
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,570
and also shows great care
for the Yue family.

631
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,110
I couldn't bear to see him troubled
by trivial court matters,

632
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,910
so I couldn't help but advise him
from time to time.

633
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,250
That's how His Majesty discovered
my true identity.

634
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,430
So you're saying

635
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,350
it was the Emperor who turned you
from Consort Yue into Prime Minister Yue,

636
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,640
from a general of the previous dynasty
into the current Prime Minister?

637
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,760
I am not an official of
any particular dynasty.

638
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,360
I am also one of the common people
of this world.

639
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,250
Any ruler who truly cares for the people

640
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,250
deserves their loyalty.

641
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,720
I have heard

642
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,790
what you said.

643
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,120
And I'm done listening.

644
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,620
You may leave now.

645
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,510
Your Majesty, you believe me?

646
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,520
I don't believe you.

647
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,800
I believe my son.

648
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,760
The current Emperor does not
make mistakes.

649
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,620
Thank you, Your Majesty.

650
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,840
I'll take my leave.

651
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,880
Yue Chi!

652
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,690
Do your best.

653
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,710
Yes!

654
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,720
This assassin matter must be

655
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,360
closely tied to Consort Yue's palace.

656
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,770
Are you really not going to intervene?

657
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,270
The Emperor is the Emperor.

658
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,070
The Empress Dowager is the
Empress Dowager.

659
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,070
The Emperor has secrets

660
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,640
he doesn't want me to know,

661
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,370
so I shouldn't interfere.

662
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,320
However,

663
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,350
if it harms the country

664
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,780
or the Emperor himself,

665
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,860
I absolutely won't tolerate it.

666
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,790
Eunuch Wang,

667
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,250
I told you to investigate Consort Yue's
place.

668
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,730
Did you find anything?

669
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,320
I went there,

670
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,170
and I brought back this thing.

671
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,050
[100-Day Plan for the Women of the Harem
to Develop Their Respective Talents]

672
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,920
Yue.

673
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,580
Your Highness.

674
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,310
I'm coming.

675
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,340
Has my skin gotten worse?

676
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,320
I don't think so.

677
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,000
Take another look.

678
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,920
Hasn't it gotten darker here?

679
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,240
Of course not.

680
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,530
I think your skin has always been
as smooth and fair.

681
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,160
It's whiter and clearer than winter snow.

682
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,100
Du Tianzhao,

683
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,880
why are you here again?

684
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,320
There are too many people
and too much gossip in this palace.

685
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,930
I just have to come more often.

686
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,000
That's the only way to make
my sister believe

687
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,720
that I'm sincere about palace maid Meili.

688
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,690
Ling'er, look at this.

689
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,970
Tianzhao,

690
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,310
I really love

691
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,620
the white jade pearl powder you gave me.

692
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,440
Making the beautiful Ling'er smile

693
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,310
is worth the beating I took.

694
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,960
My butt aches all the way to my insides,

695
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,260
and they're about to split open.

696
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,160
Then why are you still squatting?

697
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,110
Come.

698
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,190
Hurry and sit down.

699
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,110
Ling'er, you're so thoughtful.

700
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,200
Didn't you say your butt hurt so much

701
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,330
it felt like your insides would split?

702
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,230
Turns out your pain after the beating

703
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,370
is all an act.

704
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,550
Your Majesty,

705
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,410
aren't you going in?

706
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,880
Let's go to Shoukang Palace.

707
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,640
Yes.

708
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,710
What?

709
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,420
Really?

710
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,200
My apprentice saw it with his own eyes.

711
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,560
His Majesty left in anger.

712
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,310
But it was quite a coincidence.

713
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,230
Imperial Uncle was telling jokes to Her Highness at Fengluan Palace

714
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,050
when His Majesty happened to see them.

715
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,740
It was that Ling'er.

716
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,570
My foolish son

717
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,900
is finally coming around.

718
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,100
Even a foolish awakening is still awakening.

719
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,100
But why

720
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,590
is Du Tianzhao

721
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,160
trying to curry favor with Consort Yue?

722
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,480
I really don't know.

723
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,490
Maybe

724
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,880
he just wants to get closer to Her Highness.

725
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,630
His Majesty is here!

726
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,830
Why are you here?

727
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,690
Greetings, Mother.

728
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,140
You...

729
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,540
Mother,

730
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,270
well...

731
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,310
Minister Du is always at Fengluan Palace.

732
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,480
It's bound to cause gossip in the harem,

733
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,520
don't you think?

734
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,970
I remember

735
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,990
it was you who gave him the pass that

736
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,670
allows free access to Fengluan Palace.

737
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,430
If you think it's inappropriate,

738
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,110
just take it back.

739
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,960
But I gave it to him with my own hands.

740
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,030
How can I just take it back so easily?

741
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,770
That would be so humiliating.

742
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,950
Alright, alright.

743
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,250
I'm getting old.

744
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,310
I can't handle these kinds of things anymore.

745
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,240
Besides,

746
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,280
Consort Yue is pregnant.

747
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,960
You should focus all your attention on her,

748
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,660
right?

749
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,500
Stop keeping your eyes on the Imperial Uncle.

750
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,920
I'm just trying to...

751
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,640
Alright.

752
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,920
You're a grown man.

753
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,070
You should be devoted to Consort Yue.

754
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,310
Yes.

755
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,700
Stop overthinking everything else.

756
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,370
Am I...

757
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,030
devoted to Consort Yue?

758
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,250
[Yongqian Palace]

759
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,190
Yue Chi?

760
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,790
Your Majesty.

761
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,570
What happened to you?

762
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,640
Please don't ask.

763
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,929
I was just taught a painful lesson.

764
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,820
By a woman?

765
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,460
Well,

766
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,440
you could say that.

767
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,889
Take care of yourself.

768
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,210
The Yue siblings are quite interesting.

769
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,280
How's that 100-day plan of Consort Yue's

770
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:38,650
coming along?

771
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,530
Once I develop the new fragrance,

772
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,060
I'll definitely invite the sisters over to try it.

773
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,920
This fabric is common,

774
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,480
but the thread and stitching are exquisite.

775
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,630
You've put in a lot of effort, Lady Xia.

776
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

777
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,320
What's Consort Hui been busy with lately?

778
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,840
Consort Yue said she's good with numbers,

779
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,510
so she's been helping manage the accounts.

780
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,150
Your Highness,

781
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,280
stop looking at the harem's accounts.

782
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,710
Focus on our palace's instead.

783
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,030
We've gone over budget again this month.

784
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,240
It doesn't matter.

785
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,800
Ask the family for more money.

786
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,400
Oh, right.

787
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,160
Lady Lan's flute is quite worn out.

788
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,310
I have a jade quota from my rank, right?

789
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:16,970
Give it to her.

790
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:17,750
Also,

791
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,710
check if Yingwan

792
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,190
still has enough incense.

793
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,430
If not, send her some.

794
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,250
The floral fragrance enchants the air,

795
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,620
while nature's own scent mingles there.

796
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,590
This fragrance is truly wonderfully blended.

797
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,320
We should thank you for giving us this opportunity.

798
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
Otherwise, with the Palace Fragrance Department and Cloth Department,

799
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,920
how could we have the chance to do these things?

800
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,320
And Qu, thank you

801
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,980
for bringing me such excellent fragrant herbs.

802
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,390
Alright.

803
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,370
I know you've arranged this well.

804
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,660
Get started and show us.

805
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,400
Yes.

806
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,150
Why are they closing the windows?

807
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,490
It's not only to prevent the fragrance from dispersing

808
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,190
but also to avoid attracting bees and insects

809
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,790
that could harm everyone if it gets too strong.

810
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,680
You're so thoughtful.

811
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,960
When the incense charcoal burns and releases

812
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,670
the sandalwood scent inherent to the charcoal itself,

813
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,590
that means it's successfully infused.

814
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,110
Then we can cut the incense and prepare to burn it.

815
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:18,960
It smells so good.

816
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,440
Oh my!

817
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:19,960
It's really fragrant.

818
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,220
It really is fragrant.

819
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,840
Can you teach us how to make it in the future?

820
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,630
Sure.

821
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,090
Can we make it into sachets?

822
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,920
If we put the sachets on clothes, it would definitely smell wonderful.

823
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,870
Can it be made into sachets?

824
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,090
I can try.

825
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,020
Okay.

826
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,150
Something's not right.

827
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,110
Yue.

828
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,800
Yue.

829
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,170
Wake up.

830
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,380
Wake up.

831
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:15,820
Wake up!

832
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,100
Let me help you up.

833
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,310
Why is the smoke so thick?

834
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,230
Why is it so choking?

835
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,410
What's going on?

836
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,440
It's probably because the room isn't ventilated,

837
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,880
causing the smoke to build up.

838
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,480
Is anyone else inside?

839
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,410
Where's Yingying?

840
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,290
Why hasn't Yingying come out yet?

841
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,450
Yue,

842
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,550
wait for me here.

843
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,310
Your Highness!

844
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,260
Qu Yingying.

845
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,900
Qu Yingying!

846
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,160
Qu Yingying!

847
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,140
Your Highness!

848
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,030
Qu!

849
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,620
Let's carry them out first.
