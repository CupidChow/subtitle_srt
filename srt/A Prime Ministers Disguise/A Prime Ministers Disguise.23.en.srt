00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,920
[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,870
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,850
From field to table.

4
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,250
Green and healthy.

5
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,450
Little Heng No. 46 is served.

6
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,630
What's No. 46?

7
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,289
Try it.

8
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,580
Your Majesty may not know,

9
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,690
the old general

10
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,530
grows attached to

11
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,440
everything he raises.

12
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,090
So,

13
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,740
he named it Little Heng.

14
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,820
Your Majesty, please try it.

15
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,130
How is it?

16
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:41,890
Is it tender this time?

17
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,950
Tastes good today.

18
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:43,920
Haha!

19
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,970
The chickens that run in the wild

20
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,500
really do nourish the body.

21
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,729
Look at me,

22
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,590
isn't I in much better spirits

23
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,850
than I were a couple of years ago?

24
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,289
Yes,

25
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:53,050
indeed.

26
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,890
Hahaha.

27
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,050
Grandfather,

28
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,450
this time it's truly urgent.

29
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,130
That's why,

30
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,170
as Emperor, I've come to ask for your help.

31
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,890
What?

32
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,090
You dare to call yourself Emperor

33
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,170
in front of me?

34
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,250
General, General,

35
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,690
sit down.

36
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,490
Sit down.

37
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,490
I was wrong.

38
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,450
I...

39
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,329
Mobilizing troops from the capital

40
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,990
is not only a waste of resources,

41
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,930
but the casualties

42
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,310
will surely be severe.

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,090
If you return to lead,

44
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,740
we can certainly defeat the enemy!

45
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,210
Don't waste your words.

46
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,250
I've said it before,

47
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,650
you're just a reckless martial arts practitioner.

48
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,810
But you insist on overestimating yourself,

49
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,090
wanting to be the emperor.

50
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,740
Yes.

51
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,370
Now it's good.

52
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,370
Stay here

53
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,210
and keep me company raising chickens and farming.

54
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,500
Guards!

55
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,690
Yes, General.

56
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,850
Take him to the pigsty,

57
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,579
and teach him how to raise pigs.

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,250
Your Majesty,

59
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:53,530
please.

60
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,390
Let me teach you how to raise pigs.

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,730
Put down your sword!

62
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,530
Grandfather,

63
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,810
I still respectfully address you as

64
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,810
General Du.

65
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,210
You're angry at me for

66
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,490
being presumptuous back then,

67
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,610
for insisting on becoming the emperor.

68
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,340
But I did it for only one reason.

69
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,370
I wish for peace in this world.

70
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,430
Now that the enemy has invaded,

71
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,930
for the state and the people,

72
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,930
for those who once fought

73
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,890
side by side with me,

74
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,090
my trusted advisors,

75
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,930
I beg you to return.

76
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,140
That reckless boy

77
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,890
has indeed grown up.

78
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,690
It seems my daughter

79
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,200
has raised her son well.

80
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,130
However,

81
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,210
I won't

82
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,090
send troops!

83
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,230
Grandfather, you—

84
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,410
You little rascal.

85
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,250
How dare you put a sword

86
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,090
to your uncle's throat?

87
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:45,690
It's fine.

88
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,690
His Majesty is just joking with me.

89
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,250
I was wrong.

90
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,780
General, please calm down.

91
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,460
We're almost there.

92
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,250
Keep moving forward.

93
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,730
Yes, Your Highness.

94
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,450
He is a traitor.

95
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,250
Where's the evidence?

96
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,450
I will find it.

97
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,990
Stop.

98
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,290
Make them all stop.

99
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,170
Hyah!

100
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,390
Whoa!

101
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,420
Seems Your Highness doesn't trust me anymore.

102
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,409
Huo Jingheng

103
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,530
has reached the Northwest Army's position.

104
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,450
Yue Chi,

105
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,290
I did trust you.

106
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,450
But the Princess told me...

107
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,140
Do you really plan to move east?

108
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,820
Why not?

109
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,790
Once renowned throughout the land,

110
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,790
General Du, the leader of the Northwest Army,

111
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:49,890
[Mount Fengming]

112
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,490
is now living in Mount Fengming.

113
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,170
If the Li's army moves east,

114
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,770
we'll certainly pass there.

115
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:54,850
That day,

116
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,600
I overheard

117
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,960
Yue Chi and someone

118
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,310
having a secret conversation in the army.

119
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,440
Who else do you think

120
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,890
could risk coming alone

121
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,270
to the Li's army camp,

122
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,330
and also persuade General Du

123
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,350
to come out?

124
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,450
She knows you best.

125
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,610
I had to

126
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,250
consider her words.

127
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,970
You've disappointed me.

128
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,730
Yue Chi,

129
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,810
why won't you join me?

130
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,740
We are clearly on the same path.

131
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,170
You're mistaken.

132
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,140
We've never been on the same path.

133
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,130
I've long had my own companions.

134
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,730
Take him away.

135
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,620
Seems I was never meant to walk

136
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,080
the same path with Yue Chi.

137
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:48,710
So be it.

138
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:49,930
Go back,

139
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,330
set the trap,

140
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,530
and prepare to welcome our guests.

141
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,330
I'll go prepare.

142
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,850
Xue Jingguan.

143
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,409
As for Yue Chi,

144
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,070
do you want to deal with him yourself?

145
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,600
Your Highness, please dispose of him as you see fit.

146
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,770
I will kill him.

147
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,860
Don't you have anything to say?

148
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,580
Just a bit of regret.

149
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,890
But

150
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,590
what does Your Highness want to hear?

151
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,780
I'm sorry,

152
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,490
Yue Chi.

153
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,780
Fate has given me

154
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,070
gifts I don't deserve.

155
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,970
I can only accept one.

156
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,409
Don't choose me in the next life.

157
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,330
I've searched.

158
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,010
There's nothing to eat or drink over there.

159
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,050
Are you sure

160
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,090
that crossing

161
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,170
gets us to Li's camp?

162
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,630
I'm about 80% certain.

163
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,570
Worth a shot.

164
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,730
From here on,

165
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,650
I must go alone.

166
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,590
You should hurry back.

167
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,010
No way.

168
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,380
We're almost at the final step.

169
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,650
I can't leave you

170
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,850
to face danger alone.

171
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,010
Two people facing danger

172
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,170
is still danger.

173
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,760
Du Tianzhao,

174
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,460
I'm truly grateful to you.

175
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,310
You've come so far with me.

176
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,130
I'm the Imperial Uncle.

177
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,250
Consort Yue and I are both here.

178
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,450
Who dares make a move?

179
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,410
Enough.

180
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,330
That's enough.

181
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,690
I, Yue Ling'er,

182
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,420
will remember this in my heart.

183
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,410
Ling'er,

184
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,210
there's something

185
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,530
I've kept in my heart for a long time.

186
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,010
I want to tell you today.

187
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,140
Ac... actually, I've always known

188
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,520
that you don't like me.

189
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,810
But

190
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,770
even if it's just as a friend,

191
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,520
I still want to walk with you

192
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,860
on this long and difficult road.

193
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,900
This isn't just for you,

194
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,580
it's more for myself.

195
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,930
For the person I love,

196
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,730
for the life I want,

197
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,380
I, Du Tianzhao, have fought for it.

198
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,730
Du Tianzhao.

199
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,850
Go quickly.

200
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,890
The road ahead is still long.

201
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,850
Ling'er, no one's here.

202
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,610
I wonder

203
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,210
what that Prime Minister Yue

204
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,410
is really after.

205
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,850
Who would've thought

206
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,170
he was a spy all along?

207
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,690
Now look—

208
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,210
I heard they're not even

209
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,650
giving him food or water.

210
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,650
Let's go.

211
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,090
Let's get some food from the kitchen.

212
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:55,970
Let's go.

213
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,240
Your sleeping incense really worked.

214
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,210
Of course.

215
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,930
I had Yingwan specially make it.

216
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,060
It's more potent than other incenses.

217
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,610
Chi.

218
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,010
Ling'er.

219
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,700
Are you alright?

220
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,230
Why have you gotten so dark

221
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,530
and lost so much weight?

222
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,170
Never mind

223
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,210
how we got here.

224
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,170
The soldiers outside

225
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,120
have already been knocked out,

226
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,370
but it won't last long.

227
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,130
We need to

228
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,570
get you out of here first.

229
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,610
How do we unlock this?

230
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,570
This is no ordinary lock.

231
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,250
Looks like it's based on a Tibetan

232
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,650
Vajra Blossom lock.

233
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,330
We need the right tool

234
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,970
and enough force

235
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,050
to open it.

236
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,920
Ling'er,

237
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,400
don't worry about me.

238
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,050
This lock won't open.

239
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,200
We need to find a way

240
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,730
to send someone up the mountain

241
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,290
to the Northwest Army's camp

242
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,490
and tell Huo Jingheng

243
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,970
that the Li's Army
has seen through our plan

244
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,570
and they haven't moved east.

245
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,850
Alright, I understand.

246
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,910
I'll go right away.

247
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,250
Ling'er.

248
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,810
It's very dangerous.

249
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,930
Be careful.

250
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,050
Don't worry.

251
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,690
As long as I'm not shattered into pieces,

252
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,570
I'll make sure

253
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,230
Ling'er stays safe and sound.

254
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,480
I'm counting on you.

255
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,430
Be careful on your way.

256
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,960
Let's go, Ling'er.

257
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,330
Your Highness,

258
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,090
there's a man and a woman
acting suspicious

259
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,170
outside the camp.

260
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,770
Be careful.

261
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,020
It's very slippery.

262
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,650
I knew

263
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,250
my brother and His Majesty

264
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,850
wouldn't fall out so easily.

265
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,690
It's just that

266
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,210
they're keeping things from me again.

267
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,460
Well, going all out with the act.

268
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,370
Aren't they keeping things from me too?

269
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,210
But

270
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,410
come to think of it,

271
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,330
they

272
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,980
still have to rely on us,

273
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:50,960
don't you think?

274
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,120
Mainly relying on you.

275
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,140
So we need to

276
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,100
put in more effort to move forward.

277
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,410
That sister Yunqing of yours

278
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,290
is truly a vicious woman.

279
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,090
Next time you see her,

280
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,660
you won't go soft, will you?

281
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,670
I won't go soft.

282
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,490
You...

283
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,550
Let her go.

284
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,770
Let go of Ling'er!

285
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,440
You really think

286
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,610
just the two of you

287
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,900
can make it to the Northwest Army's camp?

288
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,690
Without you,

289
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,890
I could make it there.

290
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,250
Without me,

291
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,440
could you even get out of this swamp

292
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,640
and make it through this miasma forest?

293
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,170
Let go of me first.

294
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,090
I really don't know

295
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,970
why you're always against us.

296
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,930
Are you even

297
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,860
still the same person I knew—

298
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,530
I'll fight you!

299
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,730
This forest is full of
poisonous creatures.

300
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,010
Good luck to you.

301
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,010
Guys,

302
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,570
the enemy is invading.

303
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,370
They want to

304
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,300
break through our Mount Fengming.

305
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,810
Let's show them what happens

306
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,970
when you let a tiger
back into the mountains.

307
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,570
Drive them back to their homeland!

308
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,570
Drive them back!

309
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,450
General,

310
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,170
a little cripple came here,

311
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,290
saying it's urgent.

312
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,690
Something about a fire.

313
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,170
Minister Du?

314
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,250
Tianzhao.

315
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,730
Father!

316
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,040
I've missed you so much!

317
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,850
I've suffered

318
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,250
all the way here!

319
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,130
Let go!

320
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,860
Get to the point!

321
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,330
Stop crying!

322
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,970
Get up!

323
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,220
Yes, there's something.

324
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,700
It's extremely urgent.

325
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,930
What's so urgent?

326
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,850
Damn it!

327
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,570
Why is this Yi so arrogant?

328
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,890
He thinks he can ambush us?

329
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,010
Since they've changed their strategy,

330
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,130
we need to redeploy as well.

331
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,940
Let's deploy quickly.

332
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,890
Ling'er risked her life

333
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,690
to have me deliver this message.

334
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,930
What? Ling'er?

335
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,170
Where is Ling'er?

336
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,290
She was taken by

337
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,990
Jiang Yunqing on the way here.

338
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,890
Why didn't you say that earlier?

339
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,810
If I had told you earlier,

340
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,120
would you have listened to anything else?

341
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,730
Besides,

342
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,490
given the relationship
between Jiang Yunqing and Ling'er,

343
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,020
she shouldn't be in danger.

344
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,090
Grandfather,

345
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,250
do we have a map of Mount Fengming?

346
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,970
Yes. Bring the map.

347
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,210
[Li's Army Camp] [Fengming Garrison]

348
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,160
The Li's army camp lies in open terrain,

349
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,760
surrounded by dense forest.

350
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,930
Brothers!

351
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,930
Go!

352
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,490
Since they want to
take advantage of the terrain,

353
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,810
we can do the same.

354
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,400
Now that we know

355
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,640
their exact location,

356
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,290
if we attack from higher ground,

357
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,050
the Li's army

358
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,170
will be like meat on a chopping board.

359
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,160
[Ning]

360
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,960
Fight with them!

361
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,520
Prime Minister Yue!

362
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,160
Where's Ling'er?

363
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,420
Have you seen Ling'er?

364
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,270
Isn't Ling'er with you?

365
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,290
She was taken by that

366
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,410
venomous woman, Xue Jingguan.

367
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,170
What?

368
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:37,930
Wei Zhang.

369
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,890
Hurry.

370
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,480
This...

371
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,610
Stop right there.

372
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,540
Don't do anything rash.

373
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,330
I'll only help you this once.

374
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,690
Hand over Ling'er.

375
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,250
Don't act like some lovesick fool here.

376
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,650
Stop!

377
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,610
Release Ling'er,

378
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,210
and I'll spare your life.

379
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,690
Don't you want Ling'er?

380
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,090
I can give her to you.

381
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,570
Surrender.

382
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,850
Yunqing.

383
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,290
You may forget who I am.

384
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,730
But unfortunately,

385
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,530
I've never forgotten.

386
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,770
No matter who you are,

387
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,690
our bond from back then

388
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,690
was real.

389
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,610
I once thought

390
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,100
Ling'er and I were

391
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,730
your greatest support
through the long years.

392
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,090
I also believed that

393
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,890
when I went to the battlefield,

394
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,210
you'd be the strongest support

395
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,340
for the whole Yue Mansion and Ling'er.

396
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:46,770
Now,

397
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,850
do you really not care about

398
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,970
Ling'er's life?

399
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,610
It's because of the bond we once had

400
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,770
that I'm giving you a chance to choose.

401
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,130
Ling'er's life

402
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,570
is in your hands.

403
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,770
Think about it.

404
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,670
As long as you compromise,

405
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,290
as the Crown Prince of Li State,

406
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,460
I promise you

407
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,610
Yue Ling'er

408
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,850
will safely return to Ning State.

409
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,770
Ling'er!

410
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,930
Kill!

411
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,350
So this is your fine husband.

412
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,170
It's all my fault.

413
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,690
Ling'er will be alright, won't she?

414
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,050
I'm such a failure.

415
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,370
Stop right there!

416
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,810
You really think by barging into

417
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,720
Li State alone

418
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,250
you can save Ling'er?

419
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,100
You are the emperor,

420
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,880
the ruler of Ning State.

421
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,130
If the ruler of a nation

422
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,460
crosses into enemy land

423
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,200
and makes it out safely,
it's seen as provocation.

424
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,130
If you fall into danger,
it'll be a national tragedy.

425
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,450
Do you understand?

426
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,980
The one who would cross this border

427
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,630
is not the emperor,

428
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,570
but me, Huo Jingheng.

429
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,970
Two years ago

430
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,370
when I led the Qilin Army
to the battlefield,

431
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,570
I already understood

432
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,170
the responsibilities I bear

433
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,650
make it impossible for me to be myself.

434
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,970
And for you, even more so.

435
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,310
From the moment you took the throne,

436
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,340
Huo Jingheng and the emperor

437
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,690
became inseparable.

438
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,530
Go back.

439
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,090
Xue Jingguan

440
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,690
won't harm Ling'er fatally.

441
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,600
If we want to save Ling'er,

442
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,850
we need to plan carefully.

443
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,840
Early tomorrow morning,

444
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,780
we'll gather our forces

445
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,290
and attack Li State.

446
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,490
Yes.

447
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,450
Please change into it.

448
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,450
Your clothes are so dirty.

449
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,450
They must be uncomfortable to wear.

450
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,480
At least have something to eat.

451
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,810
Even a snack would do.

452
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,850
You can go now.

453
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,570
Yes.

454
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,250
What's the point of
not eating or drinking?

455
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,280
Who are you trying to make
feel sorry for you?

456
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,330
Huo Jingheng?

457
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,890
Didn't you see

458
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,490
the arrow that was shot at us?

459
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,130
If I hadn't protected you,

460
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,650
you wouldn't be alive

461
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,980
to be angry with me here.

462
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,600
All for a man

463
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,970
who doesn't care whether you live or die.

464
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,130
After all the hardships,

465
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,410
all the suffering you've been through,

466
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,570
don't you get it?

467
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,650
He doesn't care about you at all.

468
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,380
He even chose winning

469
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,730
over you.

470
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,050
If I were him,

471
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,170
I'd have chosen

472
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,450
to shoot that arrow too.

473
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,930
I'd have chosen to win.

474
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,910
Because it's not just about winning.

475
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,210
It means

476
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,730
peace for Ning's people,

477
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,900
and the integrity of Ning State's territory.

478
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:21,910
He knew

479
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,710
that's what I'd want him to do.

480
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,320
If he didn't,

481
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,050
he'd have failed

482
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,390
Ning's people who trust and love him.

483
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,250
What about you?

484
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,610
I'm also one of Ning's

485
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,530
people.

486
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,970
You're insane.

487
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,390
When he pressed

488
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,210
the attack,

489
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:37,850
did his gaze

490
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,010
ever linger on you

491
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,090
for even a second?

492
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,450
Or was there even

493
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,050
a moment he thought of saving you?

494
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,650
Yet here you are, still making excuses for him.

495
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,170
You're hurt?

496
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,060
Ling'er,

497
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,130
I did take you hostage,

498
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,370
but I never intended to harm you.

499
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,650
In that life-or-death moment,

500
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,110
amidst the flying arrows,

501
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,850
who was it that protected you?

502
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,610
Don't you know in your heart?

503
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,790
If you don't want to eat, that's fine.

504
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,910
I'll have someone clean up later.

505
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,800
From now on, you'll stay with me,

506
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,380
and you won't see him again.

507
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:19,970
Yunqing.

508
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,770
Even now,

509
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,740
you still care about me.

510
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,410
Can't you

511
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,570
care a little more about Chi?

512
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,410
Your

513
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,090
repeated schemes against him

514
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,810
put him in danger.

515
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,290
Are you really

516
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,620
that heartless toward him?

517
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,970
You're innocent.

518
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,170
We're all

519
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,300
caught in this game.

520
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,840
But you're innocent,

521
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,490
Yunqing,

522
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:54,530
you've always taken care of me

523
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:55,970
and helped me.

524
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,570
I'm very grateful to you.

525
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,370
But this time,

526
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,250
I'm asking you,

527
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,770
begging you,

528
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,730
could you

529
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,010
please, for my sake,

530
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,730
let it go?

531
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,030
Alright, Ling'er.

532
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,410
I'm sorry.

533
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,250
I have things

534
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,290
I must do.

535
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,210
I can't stop for anyone

536
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,850
or any feelings.

537
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,340
Your Majesty,

538
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,820
it's a long way back.

539
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,830
Be careful.

540
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,050
I won't be able to eat your

541
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,050
chicken anymore.

542
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,790
I will miss it.

543
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,410
Two years ago,

544
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,530
I was angry with you,

545
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,330
and thought I'd

546
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,510
never interfere in your affairs again.

547
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,490
In your heart,

548
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,180
you still resent me, don't you?

549
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,160
I understand your thoughts.

550
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,830
How could I resent you?

551
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,530
Although I've been

552
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,540
in the mountains these past few years,

553
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,610
I've heard that you've

554
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,470
governed the country quite well.

555
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:22,810
But this world

556
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,700
should be ruled by those with virtue.

557
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,260
I'm worried about you.

558
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,130
You're

559
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:32,770
more suited for

560
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,580
a free life in the martial world,

561
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,240
instead of being the emperor.

562
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,530
In one's life,

563
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,290
only

564
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,170
unbridled freedom is the most precious.

565
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,130
I've

566
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,250
let you down.

567
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,170
Perhaps you're

568
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,930
destined in this life

569
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,300
to take the world as your responsibility.

570
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,450
Now

571
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,250
with Prime Minister Yue assisting you,

572
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,610
alright,

573
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,450
go ahead and forge your path.

574
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,730
I will help you

575
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,930
with all my strength.

576
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,170
Do you mean

577
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,720
you're willing to enter the court as an official?

578
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,910
I won't be an official,

579
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,370
nor will I enter the court.

580
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:21,870
You tell me,

581
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,660
how can it compare to my Mount Fengming,

582
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,190
so peaceful and pleasant?

583
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,570
Besides,

584
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,910
don't you still need me

585
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,650
and the Northwest Army

586
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,470
to guard this frontier for you?

587
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,380
This old general

588
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,990
is willing to lead the Northwest Army

589
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,730
to station at Mount Fengming

590
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,570
and guard the border for Ning.

591
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,920
It's getting late.

592
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,210
Mount your horse.

593
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,710
Take care of yourself.

594
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,970
By His Majesty's verbal decree:

595
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,010
Due to ongoing military affairs,

596
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,250
His Majesty is unwell

597
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,810
and won't attend morning court for the next few days.

598
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:12,810
Court dismissed.

599
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,470
[Auspice and Blessing]

600
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,530
Your Majesty,

601
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,570
as per your instructions,

602
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,840
I have dismissed them all.

603
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,040
They were all quite angry.

604
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,210
I see.

605
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,450
You,

606
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,770
won the battle

607
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,570
but lost Ling'er.

608
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,110
Say something.

609
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,930
Bring Ling'er back.

610
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,410
Bring Ling'er back.

611
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:53,030
[Auspice and Blessing]

612
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,450
Your Majesty.

613
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,620
[Auspice and Blessing]

614
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,810
I will definitely bring Ling'er

615
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,610
back.

616
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,170
I adore you.

617
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,130
I like you.

618
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,690
I want you

619
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,250
to stay, not just today.

620
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,690
Every day from now on,

621
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,290
I hope you can

622
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,370
stay by my side,

623
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,010
to help me, to be with me.

624
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,710
Not just as Emperor Huo Jingheng,

625
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,850
but more as

626
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,420
this man, Huo Jingheng, standing before you.

627
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,430
Ling'er,

628
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,850
will you?

629
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,370
Wait here.

630
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

631
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,260
[Heng]

632
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,770
Your Majesty, you men always think

633
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,370
you're meant

634
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,270
to solve everything,

635
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,130
[Heng]

636
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,450
and should fix

637
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,650
more problems.

638
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,490
But this time,

639
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,250
how was it solved?

640
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,300
Have you ever thought about it?

641
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,370
Living so comfortably, huh?

642
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,410
Of course.

643
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,450
Ling'er,

644
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:58,940
would you like to

645
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,390
have a drink with me

646
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,210
and then go to

647
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,320
Mount Wanting in the Imperial Garden

648
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,980
to watch the sunset together?

649
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,730
With me?

650
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,410
Today?

651
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,450
No.

652
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,380
With you, every day.

653
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,930
Who wants to be with you every day?

654
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,989
Greetings, Your Majesty.

655
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,090
Go,

656
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,160
bring a basin of water

657
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,290
and fetch me some rags.

658
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,730
Go now.

659
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

660
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,810
How could His Majesty

661
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,090
do such chores?

662
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:51,970
His Majesty

663
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,850
misses Her Highness so much.

664
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,850
Let's go help.

665
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,380
Although he is the Emperor,

666
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,490
he is also

667
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,820
Consort Yue's husband.

668
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,450
He just wants to tidy up the house

669
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,470
and wait for his wife to come home.

670
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:51,770
One!

671
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,090
Two!

672
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:56,690
Three.

673
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:57,650
Your Majesty,

674
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,000
the Li's army and the Kingdom Restoration League

675
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,610
are attacking together,

676
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,010
heading for the Ning-Li border.

677
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,510
Quickly order the Northwest Army down the mountain.

678
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,740
Hold the Ning-Li border at all costs.

679
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

680
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,860
Last time, they didn't choose

681
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,210
to attack the Fengming Garrison.

682
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,030
It's probably because

683
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,750
the garrison has high walls

684
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,810
and fortified towers,

685
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,970
making it difficult to breach.

686
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,890
So they retreated and opened fire on Mount Fengming instead.

687
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,270
Unexpectedly, on Mount Fengming,

688
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,090
there was a tough opponent.

689
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,810
This time, they've gathered their forces.

690
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,470
It seems they're going all in,

691
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,300
coming well-prepared.

692
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,190
Your Majesty,

693
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,290
the military situation at the front is urgent.

694
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,050
The Li State's army and the Kingdom Restoration League

695
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,890
have formed an alliance.

696
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,530
The Crown Prince of Li State is ambitious

697
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,570
and has provoked us repeatedly,

698
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,690
but always retreated in defeat.

699
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,830
But this time, they've gathered

700
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,660
their forces.

701
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,290
Even General Du's Northwest Army

702
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,810
cannot hold out alone.

703
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:46,990
Your Majesty,

704
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,820
the two enemy armies have joined forces.

705
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,420
We have already gathered all

706
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,490
our available troops.

707
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,410
I request permission

708
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,670
to personally lead

709
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,480
the Qilin Army and join Ning's elite troops

710
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
to march together

711
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,670
and repel the enemy.

712
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,500
Your Majesty,

713
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,260
I disagree.

714
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,850
If word spreads that

715
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,370
we're fighting alongside

716
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,290
the previous dynasty's army,

717
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,680
other nations will think

718
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,900
that our Ning has no principles.

719
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,990
In the future, we will become

720
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,370
a laughingstock to others.

721
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,450
Your Majesty, even if the war is urgent,

722
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,810
a nation must uphold its laws.

723
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,170
We must never cross that line.

724
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,690
The Qilin Army was once a rebel force.

725
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,010
If we rely on them too much,

726
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,610
I'm afraid it will backfire.

727
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

728
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,150
Your Majesty must not use the Qilin Army.

729
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,290
Shut up!

730
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,880
Each and every one of you,

731
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,810
if you're capable, then step up.

732
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,650
What court rules are you talking about?

733
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,970
Prime Minister Yue may be violating court rules,

734
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,370
but he can lead troops to defeat the enemy.

735
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,770
Anyone who keeps whining

736
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,340
will be sent

737
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,620
to the battlefield as human shields.

738
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,250
Tomorrow morning,

739
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,860
Prime Minister Yue

740
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,950
will lead the Qilin Army and Ning's troops

741
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,350
on a joint expedition.

742
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,530
I obey Your Majesty's order.
