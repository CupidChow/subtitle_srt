00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,850
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,770
Your Majesty!

4
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,250
I've come here to protect you personally!

5
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,289
Your Majesty.

6
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,560
The moment I opened

7
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,410
the military granary,

8
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,000
I already anticipated this outcome.

9
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,250
Those grains were reserve supplies!

10
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,590
You've saved the lives of
the common people!

11
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,130
If I were to execute you today,

12
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,060
would there be

13
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,490
another official in Ning who would
risk their life

14
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,360
for the people in the future?

15
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,729
A single war costs

16
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,250
far more than tens of thousands of lives.

17
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,270
Silence!

18
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,410
-General.
-General!

00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,080
[Zuoshun Gate]

20
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,650
Yue Chi, by order of Your Majesty,

21
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,180
has come to execute
the treasonous official.

22
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,079
Now, General Zhennan has been executed.

23
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,400
Officials,

24
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,860
do you have any objections?

25
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,740
-Your Majesty is wise.
-Your Majesty is wise.

26
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,860
The fact that all the officials have

27
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,190
gathered here is far too suspicious.

28
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,250
For the safety of the nation, I request
that Your Majesty

29
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,510
return to the palace as soon as possible.

30
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,579
You killed him.

31
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,570
Yes.

32
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,530
Why?

33
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,090
Under any circumstances...

34
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,530
at any cost,

35
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,690
I must do what needs to be done.

36
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,370
Isn't that why Your Majesty

37
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,100
recruited me to be an official
in the first place?

38
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,570
Maintaining stability in the court
and throughout the realm...

39
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,380
is what I,

40
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,280
your subject, must do now.

41
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,610
I left the martial arts world
to take the throne...

42
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,700
for the greater good I hold in my heart,

43
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,410
and for peace of mind I seek.

44
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:47,130
Not to achieve goals
by any means necessary.

45
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,700
If the place I need to reach...

46
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,380
requires treading through the blood
of the innocent

47
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,710
and over the bones of the loyal and brave,

48
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,230
then I would rather...

49
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,370
not go there.

50
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,660
[Zuoshun Gate]

51
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,769
Yue Chi,

52
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,380
in the end, I was wrong about you
after all.

53
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,930
You and I...

54
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,700
have always walked

55
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,710
different paths

56
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
and thus can never walk side by side.

57
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,820
[Zuoshun Gate]

58
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,550
[Zuoshun Gate]

59
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:49,490
Your Majesty.

60
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,090
Shouldn't Your Majesty

61
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,280
rest now?

62
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,290
Ling'er,

63
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,409
stop pacing around.

64
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,409
I'm already dizzy from your pacing.

65
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,870
I sent Yue to ask around.

66
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,010
I heard that His Majesty

67
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,090
hasn't left the Hall of Blessings

68
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,760
all day.

69
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:46,990
And today is

70
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,080
also the day of General Zhennan's

71
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,000
funeral.

72
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,430
Neither His Majesty nor Chi

73
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,780
has done anything.

74
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,490
What do you want them to do?

75
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,850
General Zhennan

76
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,370
died as a convicted criminal.

77
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,190
Did you really

78
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,840
expect the Emperor and the Prime Minister

79
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,100
to attend his funeral?

80
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,810
That's exactly what's wrong.

81
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,210
The calmer things appear, the more
frightening it becomes.

82
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,490
Since I entered the harem,

83
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,330
I've never seen

84
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,080
such a deep rift between His Majesty

85
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,120
and my brother.

86
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,190
Have some tea first to soothe your throat.

87
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,240
How can you be so calm?

88
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,860
Being anxious won't help.

89
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,670
So you can simply

90
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,530
disregard this matter entirely?

91
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,350
Not at all, not at all.

92
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,830
I've actually already thought of a way.

93
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,810
Tell me quickly.

94
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,550
This matter

95
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,159
needs to have my sister

96
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,380
talk to your brother.

97
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,110
Have you also come to pay your respects
to my father?

98
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,730
I...

99
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,490
You're the one who killed my father?

100
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,000
Give me back my father's life!

101
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,770
General Zhennan died by my hand.

102
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,090
If you want to kill someone, you should
kill me.

103
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,990
Huaizhong! You must not be rude!

104
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,220
Huaizhong is young and ignorant.

105
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,690
Please don't take offense,
esteemed guests.

106
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,570
We have many trivial matters
to attend to today,

107
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,890
so I cannot properly receive you.

108
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,870
Please go back.

109
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,470
That was my doing alone.

110
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,580
You don't need to...

111
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,580
I gave the order.

112
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,330
Didn't I?

113
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,490
You know very well that it was I

114
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,420
who fabricated your verbal order.

115
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,230
Yue Chi.

116
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,090
I am the emperor.

117
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,520
In this realm,

118
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,760
the right things may be
attributed to others.

119
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,620
But when it's wrong,

120
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,500
it must be the Emperor who erred.

121
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,040
Because the only one

122
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,500
who could have changed
the course of fate...

123
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,590
just let it happen.

124
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,960
General!

125
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,510
General!

126
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,250
I left the martial arts world
to take the throne...

127
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,710
for the greater good I hold in my heart,

128
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,230
and for peace of mind I seek.

129
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,120
If the place I need to reach

130
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,010
requires treading through the blood
of the innocent

131
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,270
and over the bones of the loyal and brave,

132
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,550
then I would rather...

133
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,930
not go there.

134
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,210
We have received orders from our lord

135
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:17,730
to come and respectfully bid farewell

136
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,210
on the general's final journey.

137
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,810
I hope you can find solace
in your grief, Madam.

138
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,790
Please, everyone,

139
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,170
convey my thanks

140
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,020
to your lord.

141
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,830
Madam speaks too highly of us.

142
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,940
Receive the coffin!

143
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,000
I, Mrs. Gu, thank you all.

144
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,880
You and I...

145
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,510
have always walked

146
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,700
different paths

147
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,010
and thus can never walk side by side.

148

[Fengyuan Hall]

149
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,220
Chi.

150
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,210
Why are you here?

151
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,780
I heard about what happened

152
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,010
in the south of the city.

153
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,210
I was really worried,

154
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,030
so I came to check on you.

155
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,860
Does everyone in the palace
know about it now?

156
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,250
The specific details aren't clear,

157
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,760
but...

158
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,510
everyone says that His Majesty
has left the palace.

159
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,690
Chi,

160
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,070
why did you do this to yourself?

161
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,190
Today, I accompanied His Majesty

162
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,890
to go hunting at Yong Mountain.

163
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,850
I was accidentally injured by a wild bear

164
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,710
and couldn't escort His Majesty
back to the palace.

165
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,570
Understood.

166
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,660
I'll arrange for someone

167
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,260
to report to the inner court.

168
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,370
You're afraid the officials would find out

169
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,570
that he went to see the son
of the convicted official,

170
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,500
causing more trouble, aren't you?

171
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,610
Chi.

172
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,950
Does it have to be this way?

173
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:39,930
What?

174
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,960
Must we

175
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,890
separate public and private matters

176
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,820
and only focus on solving problems

177
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:46,770
without caring about

178
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,370
the people involved in them?

179
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,730
Must we always choose between benevolence

180
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,450
and the greater good?

181
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,190
Can't they co-exist?

182
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,290
Ling'er.

183
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,980
It's not like that.

184
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,350
Commander,

185
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,690
the Empress Dowager has sent a message

186
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,550
requesting your immediate presence
at the palace.

187
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,170
Your Majesty,

188
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,740
the person has arrived.

189
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,810
Greetings, Your Majesty.

190
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,610
Sit.

191
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,390
Your Majesty summoned me here...

192
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,110
is there an urgent matter?

193
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:34,960
Can't I invite you over

194
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,090
just to sit and chat?

195
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,460
Your Majesty...

196
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,690
wants to hold me accountable

197
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,970
for the death of General Zhennan, right?

198
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,190
You're quite sharp.

199
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,970
I have made a mistake.

200
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,770
But I have no regrets in my heart.

201
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,080
Right or wrong—

202
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,430
that's for you to argue.

203
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,550
It's beyond my control.

204
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,790
Open it and take a look.

205
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,020
[Today, Governor Huo Xiao of Jiangzhong disregarded the frontier plan and made a move on military grains.
He's failed Your Majesty's grace, and by law, he should be executed.]

206
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,110
General Zhennan

207
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,980
saved the disaster victims of Qi City from peril.

208
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,820
That is compassion,

209
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,810
a noble act!

210
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,910
Why do you insist on

211
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,330
holding onto this against him?

212
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,500
Yue Chi,

213
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,530
I thought you understood me.

214
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,150
I don't understand.

215
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,580
I think you've already guessed,

216
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,350
haven't you?

217
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,320
Five years ago,

218
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,920
the Emperor's father

219
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,450
also encountered flooding.

220
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,770
The terrain in Jiangzhong is low-lying.

221
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,530
If the accumulated water

222
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,690
rises by even one more inch,

223
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,550
the entire Jiangzhong

224
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,230
will be submerged beyond salvation.

225
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,510
Governor,

226
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,160
the flood isn't our only concern,

227
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,330
but also the food supply.

228
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,700
The grain reserves in Jiangzhong's granary

229
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,000
are only enough for the entire city's

230
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,930
population to eat for less than five days.

231
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:26,790
In that case...

232
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,510
let's further reduce food distribution

233
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,530
to try to hold out a bit longer.

234
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,690
The imperial court's aid

235
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,990
is already on its way.

236
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,290
It should arrive

237
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,940
within 10 days.

238
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,690
Governor, terrible news!

239
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,560
An hour ago,

240
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,210
Jiangzhong's granary was flooded.

241
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,950
All the grain is now gone.

242
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:45,760
Let's go!

243
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,160
Heaven wants to destroy our Jiangzhong.

244
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:00,970
Governor,

245
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,890
natural disasters are
beyond human control.

246
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,420
Please don't bear

247
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,810
all the blame yourself.

248
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,140
How much grain do we have left
in Jiangzhong?

249
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,359
Even with what's stored
in your own residence,

250
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,220
it's barely enough for all the citizens

251
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,500
for one day.

252
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,420
Then I shall

253
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,329
fight against Heaven.

254
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,090
So many people were waiting for food.

255
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,700
Huo Xiao had no choice

256
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,900
but to take drastic measures.

257
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,930
This military grain was 300 dan
when it departed.

258
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,490
We've only passed a few cities, and half
of it is already gone.

259
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,890
How can it ever reach the border?

260
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,090
Why do you care about that?

261
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,420
At least we're not the ones embezzling it.

262
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,670
What do you want?

263
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,090
We are here under imperial orders

264
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,300
-to escort the military provisions.
-If the schedule is delayed,

265
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,230
can you bear the consequences?

266
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,890
That's right, can you bear it?

267
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,870
Governor,

268
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,150
it's the grain wagons.

269
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,010
Take them away.

270
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,090
What about the soldiers?

271
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,950
Knock them out.

272
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,160
Take the wagons and subdue the men!

273
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,520
Using the more than 100 dan
of military grain he robbed,

274
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,290
Huo Xiao managed to help all
38,000 citizens of Jiangzhong

275
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,770
-endure the darkest days of the flood.
-Are you alright?

276
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,610
My son!

277
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,170
Doctor!

278
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,500
Someone, call a doctor!

279
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:20,930
Quickly, more, give them more.

280
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,570
More.

281
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,490
But he himself didn't survive that summer.

282
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,370
The court soon sent people to investigate
the robbed military grain.

283
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,130
Indeed, it's the missing military grain.

284
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,930
Take him away!

285
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,730
Governor Huo is not a criminal!

286
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,410
You can't arrest him!

287
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,290
You can't arrest him!

288
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,730
What are you doing?

289
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,050
He's a good man! You can't take him away!

290
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,530
You can't take him away!

291
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,430
Governor!

292
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,470
Governor Huo is a good man!

293
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,600
Leave the military grain here.

294
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,810
I'll go with you.

295
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,540
Governor, you can't go with them!

296
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,580
Governor Huo is a good man!

297
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,050
You can't arrest him!

298
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,410
You can't arrest him!

299
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,570
Let go of my father!

300
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:06,650
Heng.

301
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,550
Young General.

302
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,760
You served the country and its people.

303
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,490
What crime have you committed?

304
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,180
All things in this world

305
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,590
can be driven by emotion,

306
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,120
but they must not

307
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,600
transgress reason.

308
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,840
That matter—

309
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,930
I did it

310
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,580
with the resolve to die.

311
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,790
But you did it to save lives,

312
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,510
Father.

313
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,180
If there were no people left,

314
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,210
what would be the purpose

315
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,530
of these rules?

316
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,480
One life in exchange
for the lives of many—

317
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,850
it's worth it.

318
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,320
Huo Xiao sacrificed his own life

319
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,400
to save the people of the entire city.

320
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,190
The flood has been resolved.

321
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,750
Jiangzhong is safe now.

322
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,070
To protect the rest of the Huo family,

323
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,430
after receiving the advisor's letter,

324
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,110
he committed suicide
while bearing the crime.

325
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,030
[Heng]

326
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,810
This is the birthday gift that Huo Xiao

327
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,410
gave to Heng.

328
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,650
[Heng]

329
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,980
I didn't expect...

330
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:07,390
[Heng]

331
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,970
I didn't throw it away

332
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,370
to remember

333
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,250
that Huo Xiao's blood

334
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,190
was shed for all 38,000 people

335
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,760
of Jiangzhong.

336
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,650
So...

337
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,510
he left the martial arts world.

338
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,900
He left the martial arts world
and entered this turbulent era

339
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,630
for his father.

340
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,680
For his father's words,

341
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,400
"Those who save the people of the world

342
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,030
are true heroes."

[All people under Heaven]

345
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,600
Must we always choose between benevolence

346
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,570
and the greater good?

347
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,290
Can't they coexist?

348
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,490
General Zhennan

349
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,050
saved the disaster victims
of Qi City from peril.

350
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,370
This is compassion,

a noble act!

Your Majesty,

381
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,990
Prime Minister Yue has gone to
the residence in the south of the city.

382
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,110
What are you doing here?

383
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:55,930
Have you come to ensure

384
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,530
that none of us is left alive?

385
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,370
Many have died by my hand.

386
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:51,930
By rank,

387
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,170
General Gu was not the most honored.

388
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,210
By merit,

389
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,340
he was not the most rewarded,

390
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,490
but he is the one I feel
the most guilty about.

391
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,370
I don't want to say something

392
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,090
like, "A gentleman's revenge

393
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,350
can wait for 10 years."

394
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,780
The blood on my hands runs too deep.

395
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:05,810
Perhaps I

396
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,900
won't even live to see you in 10 years.

397
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,250
But I do not regret it.

398
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,220
Everyone has their own duties.

399
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,500
As the current Prime Minister,

400
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,730
maintaining stability in the court

401
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,690
is my duty.

402
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,110
My father's duty

403
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,460
was to protect the people of Qi City.

404
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,940
He fulfilled it.

405
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,660
But he still died.

406
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,320
So you need to grow up,

407
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,100
make yourself strong,

408
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,900
and seek justice for the wrongs

409
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,480
you believe were done.

410
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,420
The sword of General Zhennan

411
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,650
has now been returned

412
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,910
to its rightful owner.

413
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,860
[Loyal Service to the Country]

414
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,710
The General had long been prepared

415
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,870
to face death.

416
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,370
Even if Your Majesty had shown mercy

417
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,230
and spared him,

418
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,550
he wouldn't have left the capital alive.

419
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,920
The integrity of the Gu family

420
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,860
and the reputation of Qi City

421
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,090
can only be preserved

422
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,950
through his death.

423
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,650
General Gu was a good official.

424
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,060
I am the one who made him
end up like this.

425
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,770
He would not blame Your Majesty.

426
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,610
It is I, his wife,

427
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,280
who harbors resentment.

428
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,570
That is understandable.

429
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,600
Your Majesty.

430
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,530
I have one more request.

431
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,890
Please, speak freely.

432
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,780
I request that Your Majesty

433
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,360
allow Huaizhong to train
in the military camp.

434
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,530
But...

435
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,140
he is the general's only son.

436
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,470
But this is also the general's

437
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,150
only dying wish.

438
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,210
I understand.

439
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,610
Are you willing

440
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,210
to serve your country
in the military camp?

441
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,190
I am.

442
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,500
I want to be like my father.

443
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,220
In the future, you

444
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,090
will surely become a true hero

445
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,950
who saves the people of the world.

446
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,330
How can you still be having tea

447
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,600
at a time like this?

448
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,930
Even condemned prisoners get a last meal.

449
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,290
I can't even have some water?

450
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,090
I don't care.

451
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,090
Today,

452
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:23,770
you must

453
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,230
think of a solution for me.

454
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,770
Alright, alright,

455
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,770
I'll think of something right away.

456
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,110
[Wei Zi'ang; Zhang Xuwen]

457
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,650
[Zhang Xuwen: Qian Duoduo]

458
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,410
Young Master!

459
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,210
Young Master!

460
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,470
Something terrible has happened!

461
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,560
What's with all this panic? It's unseemly.

462
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,740
At worst, there are assassins
trying to kill me.

463
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,770
What are you afraid of?

464
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,230
They're not trying to assassinate you!

465
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,330
They've gone to assassinate
the young lady!

466
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,320
What?

467
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,200
Your Majesty,

468
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,930
a message has come from Fengluan Palace:

469
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,570
Consort Yue is feeling unwell

470
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,250
and will not be joining Your Highness

471
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,470
for the meal today.

472
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,620
Feeling unwell?

473
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,710
Has the imperial physician checked on her?

474
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,910
Consort Yue refused.

475
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,390
Feeling unwell and still refusing
to see a physician?

476
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,160
How absurd!

477
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,280
Please slow down, Your Majesty!

478
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,540
The floor is slippery!

479
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,170
Did you send someone to summon a physician?

480
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,450
The physician has already been sent for.

481
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,250
Where are they?

482
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,780
They should be on their way.

483
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,350
She is really feeling unwell.

484
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,680
She can talk and laugh,

485
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,550
yet she just can't eat with me.

486
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,350
Perhaps Her Highness is in good spirits
right now.

487
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,180
I think she's doing quite well.

488
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,650
Why go to Fengluan Palace?

489
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,740
Why call for the imperial physician?

490
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,380
Then, Your Majesty,

491
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,730
shall we return to the Yongqian Palace?

492
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,410
We're already here.

493
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,450
Why go back now?

494
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,170
The food has gone cold.

495
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,170
Can I still eat it?

496
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,230
Your Majesty is right.

497
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,130
I'd like to see

498
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,450
what exactly she's up to.

499
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,530
Hurry up.

500
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,930
Ling'er! Open the door.

501
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,700
Don't mind me, you two talk.

502
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,530
Ling'er,

503
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,570
open the door.

504
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,610
His Majesty still has important matters
to attend to.

505
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,470
It's not something to joke about.

506
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,770
Whether I have important matters or not,

507
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,680
you seem to know quite well.

508
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,350
Chi, did you hear that?

509
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,110
His Majesty has said he has
nothing urgent.

510
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,530
Whatever misunderstandings you have,

511
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,590
just talk them out.

512
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,010
I will open the door for you

513
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,560
in two hours.

514
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,410
We're all family here.

515
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,100
Whatever you have to say,

516
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,960
just talk it out nicely, alright?

517
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,040
Yue Ling'er!

518
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,710
Let's go.

519
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:04,990
Eunuch Gui.

520
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,850
Let's go.

521
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,650
Ling'er!

522
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,240
Put that down.

523
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,180
Prime Minister Yue is still the same,

524
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,680
inconsiderate of others.

525
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,330
When one can barely protect oneself,

526
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,860
how can one care for others?

527
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,020
When you make a mistake,
you should admit it!

528
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,130
Prioritizing the important
over the trivial!

529
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,210
A city

530
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,210
and tens of thousands of lives—

531
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,090
how can that be considered trivial?

532
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:45,810
For a country,

533
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,730
military orders come before all.

534
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,610
That's what's truly important.

535
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,330
Because of cold rules and regulations,

536
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:49,930
we lost

537
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,330
a just and honest good official!

538
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,570
Or for the sake of storing grain,

539
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,850
you abandoned tens of thousands
of citizens.

540
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,530
You think that was worth it?

541
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,650
The new policy has just been implemented.

542
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,650
If we set a precedent of bending
national laws out of moral sentiment,

543
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,580
in the end, it is still

544
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,670
the common people who will suffer for it.

545
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,090
Demotion, exile, and imprisonment!

546
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,050
There were many other punitive options,

547
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,810
yet you chose to execute him!

548
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,610
Has Your Majesty considered

549
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,140
General Zhennan's wishes?

550
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,190
Perhaps he would rather die with dignity

551
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,950
than live on in disgrace.

552
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,130
Doesn't the Imperial Uncle ever get tired?

553
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,900
This is already the...

554
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,970
25th item he's fixed.

555
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,620
I don't know.

556
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
Go ask him.

557
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,030
Imperial Uncle,

558
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,010
please take a break.

559
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,810
Right away.

560
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:41,670
Your Highness,

561
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,210
it's been almost two hours.

562
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,220
Don't be anxious, Eunuch Gui.

563
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,790
What?

564
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,460
Are you nervous?

565
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,510
Why don't we go over and listen?

566
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,420
No.

567
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,010
I believe

568
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,410
they will surely reconcile.

569
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,290
So confident?

570
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,390
Of course.

571
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,570
That's my brother.

572
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,370
I know my brother very well.

573
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,610
And His Majesty

574
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,320
is also a man of reason.

575
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:40,810
Qu Yingying and I

576
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,610
have a blood feud over her father's death.

577
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,470
She once took orders from Cao Mang

578
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,810
and wanted to avenge her father.

579
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,860
But her attempt to frame Ling'er failed.

580
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,130
While Du Tianzhao was

581
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,190
escorting Cao Mang back to the city,

582
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,890
Cao Mang was rescued by someone
along the way.

583
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,650
Someone used Shuo as bait.

584
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,610
Shuo was kidnapped

585
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,010
by people disguised as imperial guards.

586
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,410
Wei Zhang discovered it.

587
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,690
Yi Qingyun came to visit,

588
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,090
and you were seen by Wei Zhang

589
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,750
accepting Yi Qingyun's gift.

590
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,410
Qi City was flooded.

591
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,210
Cao Mang lay in wait with perfect timing,

592
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,489
destroying grain stores
and bombing the dam,

593
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:11,610
forcing General Zhennan
to open the military granary.

594
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,730
You and I...

595
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,170
have fallen out because of that.

596
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,210
The mastermind behind this

597
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,590
must still be Yi Qingyun.

598
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,090
You're quite charming, aren't you?

599
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,900
I'd rather not have such charm.

600
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,840
From Jiang Yunshuo's kidnapping...

601
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,710
to General Zhennan's opening
of the granary—

602
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,840
every incident,

603
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,170
every step, and every move we made

604
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,290
was known.

605
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,300
Yi Qingyun must have planted a mole

606
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,150
among us.

607
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,750
You've done so much

608
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,900
for me and Shuo.

609
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,580
I want to stay by your side.

610
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,080
Just let me be your guard.

611
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,940
Mr. Jing's rear is wide open—

612
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,670
ripe for ambush,

613
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,350
which instead made

614
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,860
someone unremarkable gain the upper hand.

615
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,290
I thought you didn't know
how to play chess.

616
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,620
Yunqing, where's your jade pendant?

617
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,080
It's gone.

618
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,250
It's Shuo's slingshot!

619
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,650
You don't want to believe it was her,

620
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:34,810
right?

621
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,480
Give... give me some time.

622
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,030
I'll investigate.

623
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,140
How well do you know her?

624
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,300
What do you mean?

625
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,210
She was gone for so long
before coming back.

626
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,210
Why did she return?

627
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,330
Don't you want to confirm that?

628
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,000
You have your high ambitions,

629
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,490
while I also have things

630
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,490
I must do.

631
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,740
How to confirm?

632
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,180
You have to ask yourself.

633
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,120
Your Highness,

634
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,850
something seems off.

635
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,740
I'll go check on him.

636
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,000
Chi,

637
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,230
didn't you two talk it out?

638
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,170
Ling'er,

639
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,690
take care of yourself today.

640
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,390
Let me know if anything happens.

641
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,650
I have to go.

642
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,650
Your Highness, what should we do?

643
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,140
[Yongqian Palace]

644
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:55,810
[Auspicious Union of Dragon and Phoenix]

645
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,610
Your Majesty.

646
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:57,930
It's time to rest.

647
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,610
Is there a nameplate

648
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,470
that's broken?

649
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,610
Your Majesty is correct.

650
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,310
Consort Yue's nameplate,

651
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,010
indeed, has a slight crack on it.

652
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,930
I'll take it to
the Imperial Household Department right away

653
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,390
to have them make a new one.

654
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,580
[Consort Yue]

655
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,770
[Auspicious Union of Dragon and Phoenix]

656
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,880
[Consort Hui]

657
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,780
Her Highness Consort Hui.

658
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,610
Commander!

659
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,740
I've done eating.

660
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,910
I'll take my leave.

661
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,870
Okay.

662
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,570
I've put Shuo's homework

663
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,570
on your desk.

664
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,040
Remember to check it.

665
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,800
What's wrong?

666
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,740
Consort Yue's nameplate has been removed.

667
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,340
When did that happen?

668
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,350
Tonight.

669
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,630
That Huo Jingheng...

670
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,900
He can't punish me openly,

671
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,690
so he's resorting to underhanded tactics.

672
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,100
What do you mean?

673
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:15,770
This is his

674
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,870
final signal to me.

675
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,700
Ling'er became his consort

676
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,430
to maintain the relationship
between him and me.

677
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,090
Now he doesn't want that anymore.

678
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,690
After humiliating Ling'er,

679
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,200
he'll find an opportunity to deal with me.

680
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,620
Then, Commander,

681
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,020
what should we do?

682
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,550
The Crown Prince of Li

683
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,510
once tried to recruit me.

684
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,950
That won't do.

685
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,240
That'd be the capital crime
of treason and betrayal.

686
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,520
We can't worry about that now.

687
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,980
If it comes to the worst,

688
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,800
we'll have no choice but to do it.

689
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,630
As long as there's a chance to live,

690
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,010
I'll take it no matter what.

691
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,490
You're here.

692
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:23,890
Sir.

693
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,770
See for yourself.

694
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:35,760
[Huo Jingheng and Yue Chi have fallen out
in the palace]

695
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,850
Huo Jingheng and Yue Chi have fallen out.

696
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,610
Is that true or false?

697
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,670
It's true.

698
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,610
Yue Ling'er schemed

699
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,970
to bring Yue Chi and Huo Jingheng

700
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,170
together,

701
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,330
intending for the two

702
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,610
to reconcile,

703
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,860
but it backfired and instead resulted in

704
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,980
her nameplate being removed.

705
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,970
Hasn't Yue Chi ever thought about

706
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,690
storming into the palace

707
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,450
to defend his sister?

708
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,690
Yue Chi is looking for a way out.

709
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,300
He's already thinking

710
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,900
of leaving Ning altogether.

711
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,250
It seems I can prepare in advance

712
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,850
for returning to my country.

713
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,150
Congratulations, Sir,

714
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,950
on the fulfillment of your wish.

715
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,460
It's ours;

716
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,090
our wish has been fulfilled.

717
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,470
As long as you willingly

718
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,170
bring Yue Chi to me,

719
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,890
I will also willingly

720
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:20,770
give you

721
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,370
the antidote.

722
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,290
Thank you, Sir.

723
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,740
Is there anything else?

724
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,250
Sir,

725
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,410
once Yue Chi defects to Li,

726
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,620
it's a serious crime.

727
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,330
If Ning retaliates for this,

728
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,650
will you, Sir, do everything in your power

729
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,510
to protect him?

730
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,280
Are you warning me?

731
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,180
I wouldn't dare.

732
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,770
I'm just worried

733
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,790
about the talent for you, Sir.

734
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,620
Xue Jingguan,

735
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,600
looks like you've truly forgotten

736
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,660
who you really are.

737
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,650
You really think you're the princess

738
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,810
betrothed to him by imperial decree?
