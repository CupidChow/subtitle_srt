Yingying!

00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:16,750
Yingying!

6
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:17,920
Qu!

7
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,050
She's awake!

8
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,150
Qu.

9
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,430
You're finally awake.

10
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,030
We were so worried about you.

11
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,039
Where am I?

12
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,320
Consort Yue is not Consort Yue.

13
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,320
The current Consort Yue

14
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,520
is not Consort Yue.

15
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,960
But she saved us.

16
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,750
But she saved you.

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,430
This is not okay.

18
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,530
I must go testify against her.

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,440
If you want to go, go by yourself.

20
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,050
She not only saved me,

21
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,430
but she also made plans
for me in the harem.

22
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,710
There are things that I've wanted
to do but couldn't do since childhood.

23
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,170
I can do them all now.

24
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,740
I like the current Consort Yue.

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,150
Do you all

26
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,030
think this way?

27
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,380
Qu, have a good rest first.

28
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,160
I'll come back to see you later.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,660
Yingwan!

30
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,060
Yingwan!

31
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:17,680
You...

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,010
You guys, just don't...

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,520
I heard that

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,540
when Jr. Concubine Zhao was
making incense a few days ago,

35
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,880
it turned into a farce.

36
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,630
No one did it on purpose.

37
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,360
And no one was hurt.

38
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,710
So don't pursue it further.

39
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,640
I don't intend to pursue it.

40
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,560
But you also have to protect yourself.

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,360
I heard that

42
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,690
you even rushed in to save people later.

43
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,460
If anything had gone wrong,

44
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,310
your brother would have
made incense out of me.

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,490
Got it.

46
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,320
Don't worry.

47
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,750
This almond pastry tastes good.

48
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,950
The Imperial Kitchen's skills
have improved.

[Yongqian Palace]

50
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,760
This Man King, Cao Mang,

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,030
didn't specify anything in the memorial,

52
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,770
but he tried to threaten me
with every word.

53
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,000
In my opinion, we can ignore him for now.

54
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,430
Your Majesty.

55
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,000
This was taken from a carrier pigeon

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,660
sent from the Yanning Palace.

57
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,920
Consort Hui.

58
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,570
[Consort Yue was replaced
with someone else.]

59
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,450
Wei Zhang,

60
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,510
don't tell anyone about this matter.

61
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:48,940
Your Majesty,

62
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,740
let's just arrest her directly.

63
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,579
I have plenty of methods

64
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,510
to make Consort Hui tell the truth.

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,560
Wei Zhang.

66
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,170
It looks like I've underutilized

67
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,270
your talents by letting you
be the Captain of the Guards.

68
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,870
Perhaps I should appoint you

69
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,240
as the Chief Eunuch of the Eastern Depot.

70
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,560
Just leave now.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,710
Yes.

72
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,340
Indeed,

73
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,779
this person is far more
complex than we thought.

74
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,380
We might as well observe
her for a while longer.

75
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,070
Fortunately, we intercepted this note.

76
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,770
Otherwise, it would've caused big trouble.

77
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,210
But how did Consort Hui
know that Ling'er...

78
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,430
Brother.

79
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,020
Ling'er.

80
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,570
Ling'er.

81
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,000
What are you two talking about?

82
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,070
Nothing special.

83
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,270
We're just chatting.

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,860
What did you bring?

85
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,040
This is newly-brewed plum wine.

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Taste it.

87
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,950
Come on.

88
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,580
Let's taste it.

89
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,700
It's refreshing and delicious.

90
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,560
I think

91
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,800
my mother will definitely like it.

92
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,620
Tomorrow,

93
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,590
find some time to let my mother taste it.

94
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,130
Okay.

95
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,890
Ling'er,

96
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,750
now that you've married into the palace,

97
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,770
how come you have to work instead?

98
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,190
Brother.

99
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,790
I actually quite enjoy it.

100
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,000
The concubines in the harem
each have their own talents.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,390
I've been inspired and encouraged by them.

102
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,680
I'll take this wine over to her tomorrow.

103
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,190
Good.

104
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,860
Now that Dog Huo is smiling,

105
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,270
he must be up to no good.

106
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,260
Ling'er likes brewing wine.

107
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,380
Your Grace,

108
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,450
this is my newly-brewed plum wine.

109
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,830
I brought it for you to taste.

110
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,300
Consort Yue, when can you
take off this veil?

111
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
The condition of my face got better.

112
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,380
But recently, I must have eaten
something wrong again.

113
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,900
Some red rashes have appeared again.

114
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,700
Is that so?

115
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,730
Let me take a look.

116
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,730
Why are you still hiding it?

117
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,960
Sister, your rash

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,920
seems to have almost healed.

119
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,430
I can't hold my liquor well.

120
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,780
I can't drink with Your Grace
and Consort Yue.

121
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,240
I'll leave first.

122
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,090
Don't be afraid.

123
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,270
No matter what,

124
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,840
you'll always be our Consort Yue.

125
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,390
This fruit wine is indeed
refreshing and mellow

126
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,360
with an endless aftertaste.

127
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,920
How come she's using the same
phrase as her son did?

128
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,710
She has already left.

129
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,630
Just sit down.

130
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,110
It's awkward to keep standing.

131
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,630
That's not right.

132
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,020
That's not the point.

133
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,370
The point is that her reaction to me

134
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,440
is just too calm.

135
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,730
If you like it,

136
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll brew more and send it over here.

137
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,310
Sure.

138
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,640
Don't let me drink alone.

139
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,070
You should drink, too.

140
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,370
You have the best alcohol tolerance,

141
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,440
don't you?

142
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,200
I...

143
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,380
I'm pregnant, aren't I?

144
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,480
Last time, you drank a lot, too.

145
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,490
Cheers.

146
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,290
Since you took charge of the harem,

147
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,610
everyone has been prospering

148
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,090
with their own strengths.

149
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,950
Isn't that wonderful?

150
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,480
Well, women...

151
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,409
can't always stare

152
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,600
fixedly at men.

153
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,130
What's the use of that?

154
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,520
You have to take care of yourself.

155
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,190
Right?

156
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,830
You're just like how I was in my youth.

157
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,360
No, no.

158
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,140
I wouldn't dare to
compare myself with you.

159
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,870
Cheers.

160
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,830
Your Grace, you look so happy.

161
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,000
I think you're very fond of

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,390
Consort Yue.

163
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,850
I'm fond of her.

164
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,390
I'm particularly fond of her.

165
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,720
She's smart.

166
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,470
Look at this little face.

167
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,630
Look at this smooth skin.

168
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,909
If she could also give birth
to a grandchild for me,

169
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,210
I would like her even more.

170
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,809
I'm sure she'll fulfill
your wish, Your Grace.

171
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,400
You know what?

172
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,600
Zhao Yingwan immediately

173
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,120
took off my veil.

174
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,190
After seeing me, she said that

175
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I was the Consort Yue they had in mind.

176
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,480
I was touched at that moment.

177
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,080
I thought this friend was really good.

178
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,480
But that's not the point.

179
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,840
The point is the Empress Dowager.

180
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Guess what she said.

181
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,960
What did she say?

182
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,750
She said,

183
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,120
"Whether she's a tall
or short daughter-in-law,

184
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,630
as long as the Emperor likes her
and she gets along with me,

185
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,720
she's just a good daughter-in-law to me."

186
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,360
Then I got really nervous.

187
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,150
I said,

188
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,320
"Yes, yes, yes."

189
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,290
But she has also said that

190
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,670
I have quite the style
she had in her youth,

191
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,440
and I've managed

192
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,200
the six palaces very well.

193
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,640
What happened then?

194
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,390
Then I got even more nervous,

195
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,470
so I drank a few more cups of wine.

196
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,910
Then I passed out.

197
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,220
After I passed out, she sent me back here.

198
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,500
You were too careless.

199
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,940
You could even get drunk in front of
the Empress Dowager in broad daylight?

200
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,380
Though my mother may

201
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,530
usually seem carefree on the surface,

202
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,930
actually, she's clearly

203
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,170
aware of everything.

204
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,950
She has long known about

205
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,670
Consort Yue's real identity.

206
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,680
Indeed.

207
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,540
But she hasn't exposed it
after finding out about it.

208
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,740
She and I are of one mind,

209
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,410
so it's not a problem.

210
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,330
Currently, I'm most worried about Ling'er.

211
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,880
From now on, when you're
in front of other consorts,

212
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,940
you need to appear calm and composed.

213
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,480
If anyone else

214
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,030
asks you questions about your appearance,

215
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,480
just play dumb,

216
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,220
especially with Consort Hui.

217
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,060
Don't worry,

218
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,000
I know what to do.

219
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,280
Just eat.

220
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,570
Let's eat.

221
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,670
[Yongqian Palace]

222
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,390
The Rongying Academy has
been managed well lately.

223
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,120
The vassal kings have also
stopped complaining.

224
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,700
Previously, it was like

225
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,110
"One bad apple spoils the whole bunch."

226
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,410
When it occurs to me that I still have to

227
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,350
play along with Cao Mang in the future,

228
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,350
I'm just so upset.

229
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,270
But let's keep him here.

230
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,970
He might be useful someday.

231
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,890
Currently, there's something else
that's more worrying.

232
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,080
What are you looking at?

233
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,310
Don't you think

234
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,980
she should have a baby bump by now?

235
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,070
It's not a problem.

236
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,140
Let's ask Ling'er to use a cushion
when the time comes.

237
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,330
However,

238
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,240
when it's time for the birth after May,

239
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,750
where are we going to get a newborn baby?

240
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,270
Then let's ask Ling'er

241
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,130
to say that she had a miscarriage.

242
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,360
That's not okay.

243
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,890
The imperial heir is too important.

244
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,480
If something really goes wrong,

245
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,610
the entire court will demand
a thorough investigation.

246
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,920
Then let's just use a fake belly for now.

247
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,860
When it's time for the birth,

248
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,240
we'll find a baby to be the substitute.

249
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,950
Not to mention that
a baby may cry all the time,

250
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,840
how can we bring the baby

251
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,310
into the palace without anyone noticing?

252
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,480
Besides,

253
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,530
where are we going to find a baby?

254
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,210
Steal.

255
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,390
Snatch?

256
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,840
Buy?

257
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,320
None of these seem appropriate, huh?

258
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,650
Who's there?

259
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,980
Keep your voice down.

260
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,290
It's me.

261
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,470
Brother.

262
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,260
Why are you here?

263
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,750
I was worried about you.

264
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,390
Worried?

265
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,040
About what?

266
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,770
Huo Jingheng and Yue Chi

267
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,580
thought that they could scare me

268
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,850
with their words in court.

269
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,650
That's absolutely ridiculous.

270
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,490
Then, Brother, when you're here this time,

271
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,820
what do you want me to do?

272
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,060
I want you to find a way

273
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,690
to make Consort Yue miscarry

274
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,870
to terminate the imperial bloodline.

275
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,160
But she saved you.

276
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,750
There are things that I've wanted
to do but couldn't do since childhood.

277
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,370
I can do them all now.

278
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,400
I like the current Consort Yue.

279
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,110
Do you all think this way?

280
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:22,940
What?

281
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,350
Have you forgotten our family's

282
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,110
blood feud?

283
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,560
Consort Yue is indeed good at her tactics.

284
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,670
Within just a few days,
she has made you waver.

285
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,120
How can you even face your
deceased family members?

286
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,800
Don't worry, Brother.

287
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,470
I will never forget our blood feud.

288
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,660
This is the abortifacient.

289
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,780
Make it quick.

290
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,130
[Yanning Palace]

291
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,120
Wei Zhang.

292
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,940
Did you hear that clearly?

293
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:25,940
Yes, I did.

294
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,630
Man King gave Consort Hui
a packet of abortifacient

295
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,960
and asked her to quickly
terminate the imperial bloodline.

296
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:31,970
Wei Zhang,

297
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,600
you must keep a close eye on
Consort Hui's movements at all times

298
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,800
and report them to me.

299
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,470
Why don't we just arrest her directly?

300
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:37,970
Go!

301
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,510
Yes.

302
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,490
When Man King is

303
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,420
kept here, he's actually quite useful.

304
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,930
Your Majesty, what are you
going to do next?

305
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,130
Of course I'm going to help Consort Hui.

306
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,030
The Emperor and Prime Minister Yue

307
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,550
are quite scheming.

308
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,650
He has been ignoring it all this time

309
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,480
and thinks that Qu Yingying
can be of use to him now.

310
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:14,860
Your Grace,

311
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,960
what are you going to do next?

312
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,130
Ning has just been stabilized.

313
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,620
Nominally, we need an heir
to appease the people.

314
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,690
As for how he

315
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,750
conjures up a grandchild for me,

316
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,360
I don't care.

317
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,720
Anyway,

318
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,100
if he says there is one,

319
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,630
then there must be one.

320
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Your Grace, you're truly wise.

321
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,350

00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,900
With the Empress Dowager's decree,

323
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,050
they've surrounded the gate?

324
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,320
Those guards are here again?

325
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,790
No.

326
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,790
Not the guards.

327
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,320
What a good hand of cards.

328
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,510
You're about to win again?

329
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,480
Don't target my cards.

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,960
Sisters,

332
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,390
why don't you play mahjong inside?

333
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,950
Don't worry, Sister.

334
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,000
We're just entertaining
ourselves at your palace gate

335
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,500
by the Empress Dowager's orders.

336
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,630
[Fengluan Palace]

337
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,320
We're here to protect you
and the imperial fetus.

338
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,210
But...

339
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,240
Sister,

340
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,570
you can just go inside.

341
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,740
Be careful not to have heatstroke.

342
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,700
Besides,

343
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,030
we finally got a chance
to get some fresh air outside.

344
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,860
Right?

345
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,110
It's your turn.

346
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,910
-I have such a good hand of cards.
-Look.

347
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,270
Come on.

348
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,390
One more round.

349
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,250
What's all this commotion about?

350
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,070
It looks like I need to
think of another way.

351
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,560
What should I do?

352
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,100
The Empress Dowager

353
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,520
has made the Fengluan Palace
surrounded so tightly.

354
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,320
Those who know it may
think it's for protection,

355
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,920
but those who don't know it
may think a criminal is confined here.

356
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,300
My mother suddenly interfered in it.

357
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,520
She has not only made things difficult
for Consort Hui and Cao Mang

358
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,650
but also made things difficult for me.

359
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Do you think

360
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,119
the Empress Dowager knows that
Consort Yue isn't pregnant?

361
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,810
Haven't you sensed it yet?

362
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,680
Now my mother doesn't care

363
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,520
whether Consort Yue is pregnant or not.

364
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,319
She's determined to have
this eldest grandchild.

365
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,030
Well...

366
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,750
What do you think

367
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,000
we should do now?

368
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,420
Let's go out first and then talk.

369
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,000
Let's go.

370
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,680
Where are Your Majesty
and Consort Yue going?

371
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,270
Mother, why are you here?

372
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,750
Eunuch Wang, why didn't you

373
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,960
inform me in advance?

374
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,830
Your Majesty.

375
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,880
Why am I here?

376
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,510
Of course I'm here to check
on my daughter-in-law

377
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,880
and eldest grandchild.

378
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,310
Consort Yue, I don't think you should go.

379
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,220
It's very dangerous outside.

380
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,270
Moreover,

381
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,110
this is the first baby in our harem.

382
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,440
We must protect it with the utmost care.

383
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,830
Isn't that right, Eunuch Wang?

384
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,760
Of course we must be extra careful.

385
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,070
I will

386
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,030
take you to practice some
childbirth-assisting skills.

387
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,460
Mother.

388
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,160
Let's go.

389
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,840
Let's go practice the skills.

390
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,060
Didn't you just say that
you were the mighty Emperor?

391
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,750
You fool.

392
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,920
I'm determined to have
this eldest grandchild.

393
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,380
If the conditions permit, have a baby.

394
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,710
If not, we still have to create
the conditions to have a baby.

395
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,420
Is it reliable?

396
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,190
I'm sure of it.

397
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,560
I told Ling'er to say
she was craving sour food,

398
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,070
especially the sour jujube cakes
from the Xianglong Bakery

399
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,800
next to Prince Anle's Mansion.

400
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,030
Yue personally went out
of the palace to buy it.

401
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,640
I also asked Eunuch Wang to
report it to the Empress Dowager.

402
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,430
When the Empress Dowager
heard that Ling'er wanted sour food,

403
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,490
she was very happy.

404
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,340
After all,

405
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,200
‌"Sour for a son and spicy for a daughter."

406
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,400
Don't talk nonsense.

407
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,820
Having a boy or a girl is the same.

408
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,060
My mother doesn't have such outdated ideas.

409
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Neither do I.

410
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,160
That's not important.

411
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,200
What's important is that

412
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,270
I asked Yue to deliberately
pass by the Yanning Palace,

413
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,480
put the food box at the door

414
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,030
and pretend to go to the toilet
because of a stomachache.

415
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,790
I also sent someone to keep an eye on it.

416
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,250
He just came to tell me that

417
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,440
he saw Consort Hui put poison in it.

418
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,750
Great.

419
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,170
-Yue is coming.
-Yue is coming.

420
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,230
Hurry up!

421
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,000
Did Consort Hui put poison in it?

422
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,790
Yes, she did.

423
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,910
Finally, all of this can be over now.

424
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,620
The Empress Dowager is here!

425
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,190
Greetings, Your Grace.

426
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,430
Why are you here, Your Grace?

427
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,720
Consort Yue.

428
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,560
I've heard that you love to
eat sour jujube cakes.

429
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,660
I'm so pleased.

430
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,160
This is a sign that

431
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,720
you'll give birth to a prince.

432
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,720
It's not that I prefer boys to girls.

433
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,780
I'm just really happy.

434
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,680
So,

435
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,350
I summoned the pastry chef
from the Xianglong Bakery overnight

436
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,720
to make the freshest
sour jujube cakes for us.

437
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,550
Look.

438
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,680
From now on,

439
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
you can't eat such

440
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,230
stale food anymore.

441
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,680
Take it away.

442
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,350
What are you still waiting for?

443
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,700
Yes, Your Grace.

444
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,270
You can taste it.

445
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,350
Taste it.

446
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,400
It looks delicious.

447
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,300
Is that so?

448
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,550
He's an authentic artisan.

449
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,790
Look at our Consort Yue's little face.

450
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,920
It's so round and plump.

451
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,760
This freshly-made cake
is indeed different.

452
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,690
The jujubes are so fresh and sweet.

453
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,280
Yue Ling'er,

454
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,650
that's not the point.

455
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,820
What are you doing?

456
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,110
The prince you'll give birth to

457
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,830
will surely be plump and adorable.

458
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,680
Don't you think so?

459
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,740
Don't you think so?

460
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,310
Thank you for your compliments.

461
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,880
From now on, in this Fengluan Palace,

462
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,350
don't let those mosquitoes and flies

463
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,160
come in so casually.

464
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,590
And those unclean things

465
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,640
and food

466
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,110
also have to be checked carefully.

467
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,390
As for that Left Prime Minister,

468
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,350
don't let him come here
for the time being.

469
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,280
Yes, Your Grace.

470
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,320
You have to check everything thoroughly.

471
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,400
Is it delicious?

472
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,210
Once again I can't go out.

473
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,300
I really have no choice.

474
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,150
Why don't we

475
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,290
first find out about

476
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,290
Consort Hui's next plan

477
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,410
and then discuss how to cooperate?

478
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,080
What do you think, Prime Minister?

479
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,570
But how can we know her next plan?

480
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,150
How about

481
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,840
just saying that Ling'er
had a miscarriage

482
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,240
and fabricating false evidence
pointing to Consort Hui?

483
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,100
Anyway,

484
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,350
it's not like we're falsely accusing her.

485
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,080
How will we fake a miscarriage?

486
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,550
My mother has made this
Fengluan Palace surrounded so tightly.

487
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,510
Have you forgotten

488
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,030
how much trouble you had
sneaking in just now?

489
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,200
That's not okay.

490
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,090
I have an idea.

491
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,880
How about I sneak in?

492
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,550
I don't need to use my
identity as Consort Yue.

493
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,960
I'll blacken my face,

494
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,290
pretend to be the palace maid,
Meili, and then sneak in.

495
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,790
Anyway, Consort Hui doesn't know

496
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,480
what the palace maid, Meili, looks like.

497
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,480
I'll take the opportunity
to get close to her.

498
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,670
I'll say that last time, because of
the Left Prime Minister's matter,

499
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,240
I was punished by Consort Yue,

500
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,570
so I hold grudges
and want to join her side.

501
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,100
In this way, we'll know what her

502
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,000
next plan is, won't we?

503
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,500
That's not okay.

504
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,030
It's too dangerous for you
to go there rashly.

505
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,950
Brother.

506
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,160
I know Consort Hui quite well.

507
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,480
Last time, I was the one who suggested
she could manage the accounts.

508
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,110
Actually, she's not a bad person.

509
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,170
So, in my opinion,

510
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,440
even if something goes wrong,

511
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,330
it won't be a big deal.

512
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,920
You're too naive.

513
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,590
If she hadn't held great grudges
against our Yue family,

514
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,240
why would she risk committing
the crime of harming the imperial heir

515
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,370
to help Cao Mang?

516
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,580
Alright.

517
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,450
Let's do as Ling'er said.

518
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:57,630
[Yanning Palace]

519
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,350
Sister,

520
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,440
why are you taking action so sluggishly?

521
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,910
I suspect that someone has leaked
information to the Empress Dowager.

522
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,440
Although the Empress Dowager has

523
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,960
withdrawn all the concubines
from the Fengluan Palace,

524
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,720
she can still get news

525
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,550
about the Fengluan Palace promptly.

526
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,160
It's no longer safe to take
action within the palace.

527
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,020
The information has been leaked?

528
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:30,700
Who's that?

529
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,490
Oh, no.

530
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,820
Before coming out, I was afraid
I would get hungry.

531
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,220
I ate too many pastries.

532
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,170
Don't move.

533
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,920
Sister.

534
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,270
There are many people and
prying eyes in the palace.

535
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,800
Let's keep our voices down.

536
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,140
Is your birthday coming soon?

537
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,510
You mean...

538
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,040
Even the strongest fortress

539
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,410
still needs people inside
to defend it, doesn't it?

540
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,730
You must succeed.

541
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,060
It seems that they've left.

542
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,910
They've left?

543
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,480
Did you hear their plan just now?

544
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,720
It seems that they're going to hurt me.

545
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,890
Are you scared?

546
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,860
Qu Yingying isn't bad by nature.

547
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,320
She won't harm my life.

548
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,390
She's going to hurt you.

549
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,670
But you're still defending her?

550
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,650
It seems that they're eagerer to hurt you.

551
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,590
Your hair is messy.

552
00:26:58,970 --> 00:26:59,740
Don't move.

553
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,780
I'm so angry.

554
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,600
Don't you know what she's up to?

555
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,880
What could she be up to, Mother?

556
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,880
If she invites others to
her birthday banquet,

557
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,540
she also has to invite
Consort Yue, doesn't she?

558
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,730
What's going on?

559
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,910
We're having an argument.

560
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,430
I can sense that.

561
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,110
I'm asking what you're arguing about.

562
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,750
What are you two whispering about?

563
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,010
Is there anything that I shouldn't know?

564
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,480
You can know.

565
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,610
However, why are you being so angry

566
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,000
early in the morning?

567
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,070
I'm furious.

568
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,290
Let me ask you.

569
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,610
Consort Hui sent you an invitation letter

570
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,570
to attend her so-called birthday banquet.

571
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,780
Is that true?

572
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,510
I've just found out about it.

573
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,030
You're not allowed to go.

574
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,440
I want to go.

575
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,160
Why?

576
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,910
What if something bad happens?

577
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,100
His Majesty will protect me.

578
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,030
Him?

579
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,890
Yes.

580
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,390
I will certainly protect Ling'er well.

581
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,830
That's not okay, either.

582
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,820
I don't think I'm a favored consort.

583
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,350
I'm clearly a prisoner

584
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,730
who's confined in this square courtyard.

585
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,290
Alright. You may go.

586
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,100
But just be careful with the food you eat.

587
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,680
And you can't misbehave, either.

588
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,400
If anything bad happens
to the imperial heir,

589
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,530
I will certainly punish you severely.

590
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,980
Have you kept that in mind?

591
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,050
Understood.

592
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,440
Isn't this the famous
troupe in the capital?

593
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,170
It isn't that easy to invite this troupe.

594
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,790
Qu is really amazing.

595
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,200
As long as everyone is happy, it's fine.

596
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,750
Sisters,

597
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,750
enjoy the food and drinks!

598
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,450
Thank you, Qu.

599
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,550
Thank you, Qu.

600
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,370
It's so wonderful.

601
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,700
I put the abortifacient in every dish.

602
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,280
I don't believe you won't be poisoned.

603
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,390
His Majesty is here!

604
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,620
Greetings, Your Majesty.

605
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,420
Greetings, Your Grace.

606
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,460
Your Majesty.

607
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,580
Come on.

608
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,440
Over here.

609
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,350
Your Grace.

610
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,110
Alright.

611
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,350
Ling'er.

612
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,310
Be careful.

613
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,750
Consort Yue.

614
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,550
You're here.

615
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,400
Look. These are some osmanthus
cakes I made by myself.

616
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,150
Try one.

617
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,270
They're very delicious.

618
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,360
Thank you, Qu.

619
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,380
Happy birthday.

620
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,510
I haven't left the Fengluan
Palace for a long time.

621
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,650
I want to go for a walk.

622
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,790
Enjoy the food.

623
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,290
It's indeed quite good.

624
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,040
Consort Yue.

625
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,890
That's not what I've arranged.

626
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,620
Consort Yue!

627
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,070
Consort Yue, where are you going?

628
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,680
Come back!

629
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,230
Why is Ling'er leaving?

630
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,270
Mother.

631
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,270
Look.

632
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,030
Why is there dust on these pastries?

633
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,660
This Consort Hui...

634
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,790
Consort Yue!

635
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,070
Consort Yue!

636
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,590
Wait!

637
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,000
What's wrong?

638
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,140
I slipped.

639
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,480
Consort Yue.

640
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,910
Let's go back and eat.

641
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,560
Let's go.

642
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,070
No need.

643
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,070
Let's go back.

644
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:54,940
Come on.

00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,430
Y-You're trying to frame me?

647
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,110
I...

648
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,550
It wasn't me.

649
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,680
Oh, no!

650
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,310
Consort Hui pushed Consort Yue

651
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,680
into the water!

652
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,070
It wasn't me.

653
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,200
You don't need to repeat it.

654
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,720
It wasn't me.

655
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,610
Come and save her!

Oh, Your Grace!

00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,960
What's going on here?

665
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,680
Consort Hui pushed

666
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,920
Consort Yue into the water.

667
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,440
You...

668
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,560
How dare you!

669

00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,710
-Arrest her!
-It wasn't me.

Let her await trial from me!

Consort Yue is weak.

680
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,240
The cold water has made her get a chill.

681
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,110
Moreover, the baby is not full-term yet.

682
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,220
And Consort Yue has suffered a shock.

683
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,640
The baby...

684
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,640
What's wrong with the baby?

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,280

00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,600
witnessed the great love between you two!

706

Let's return to our palace!

00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,470
I'll keep today's incident confidential.

709
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,820
This time, I can go back...

710
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,300
to retire in peace, right?

711
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,570
Thank you, Your Majesty.

712
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,720
I'm so angry!

713
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,350
He just did that to spite me!

714
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,350
Your Grace, please calm down.

715
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,750
I think he's just like my father.

716
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,310
Your Grace, please calm down.

717
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,110
He's quite something.

718
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,590
He's really something!

719
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,960
I'd like to see

720
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,240
what kind of fluff is stuffed in his head!

721
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,880
Yes, yes.

722
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,240
Your Grace, please calm down.

723
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,240
Stop asking me to calm down!

724
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,900
Can't you say something else?

725
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,240
I will!

726
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,130
I'll say something else!

727
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,590
Your Grace, cool down.

728
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,230
Please don't be angry.

729
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,360
Now that the child is gone,

730
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,000
His Majesty must be very sad, too.

731
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,110
He's not sad at all.

732
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,110
I think he's very happy.

733
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,230
He and Consort Yue are in cahoots.

734
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,290
Could it be that...

735
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,330
Let's leave it at that for now.

736
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,889
What if there's still hope?

737
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,710
Maybe I can still have a grandchild.

738
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,570
Grandchild?

739
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,000
Your Grace, you're right.

740
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,760
