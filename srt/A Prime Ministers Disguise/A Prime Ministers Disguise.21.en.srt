[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,789
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,080
You're awake.

4
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
Your Highness.

5
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,460
Are you surprised?

6
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,130
Why didn't you kill me?

7
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:33,950
If you died,

8
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,570
our two countries would surely be at war.

9
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:38,990
I didn't do it for you,

10
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,330
but for the people.

11
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,890
I won't be grateful to you guys.

12
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,920
You were just injured yesterday.

13
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,990
Eat something.

14
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,570
Don't worry. It's not poisonous.

15
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:03,990
You...

16
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:05,990
Forget it.

17
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,110
Let him be.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,830
How's your leg?

19
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,889
Does it still hurt?

20
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,230
The wound is festering.

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,829
Later,

22
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,079
apply the herbs I just picked to it.

23
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,890
I think it'll get better then.

24
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,230
His wound won't heal.

25
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,110
Apply that small piece of

26
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,280
black ointment in my bag

27
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,350
to his wound.

28
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,510
What is it?

29
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,640
It's very precious.

30
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,750
With it, necrotic flesh can regenerate

31
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,480
and broken bones can be mended.

32
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,090
This way, I won't owe you
anything anymore.

33
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,690
When we meet again next time,

34
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,890
let's fight against
each other to the death.

35
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,120
Come and eat something.

36
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,290
Otherwise, your body can't endure it.

37
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,680
I've drunk too much decoction.

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,680
My digestive system has long been damaged.

39
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,470
Even if you now bring me

40
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,510
some nectar,

41
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,600
I wouldn't want to drink it.

42
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,950
You were just

43
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,350
bitten by a snake

44
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,310
and then attacked

45
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,230
by my palm.

46
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,790
I've also readjusted your internal energy.

47
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,790
You've even taken the herbs

48
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,720
Prime Minister Yue picked for you.

49
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,170
Why is your pulse

50
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,350
still so chaotic?

51
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,560
Your Majesty's physique is quite strong,

52
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,990
while my body

53
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,750
is as weak as

54
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,610
a deep well that's about to dry up.

55
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,960
What's the use of irrigating it again?

56
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,490
It will only nourish those

57
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,750
vines clinging to the well walls

58
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,960
so that they can gradually swallow me.

59
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,000
If you're the ultimate winner,

60
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,750
there won't be

61
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,930
any benefits for Li State.

62
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,550
You must be curious

63
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,510
why a dying man like me

64
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:17,829
has caused

65
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,480
the Li State's bloodline to wither.

66
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,950
You have no descendants.

67
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,960
Li State will surely

68
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,630
fall into chaos when you die.

69
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,230
I may be vengeful,

70
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,830
but I'm not a narrow-minded person.

71
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,960
There's no harm in telling you two now.

72
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,310
My nephew, Yi Xin,

73
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,390
is still alive.

74
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,000
He will inherit the throne.

75
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,270
Yi Xin?

76
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,909
Why haven't I

77
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,510
heard of this prince before?

78
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,830
Because the former Crown Prince

79
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,230
hated this son the most.

80
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,270
He's the most unlike his

81
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,830
cruel and ignorant father.

82
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,670
Then why didn't you directly

83
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,530
support him to ascend the throne?

84
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,000
And why did you still
come to provoke Ning?

85
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,710
Being a monarch is difficult.

86
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,340
I think you understand it
deeply as the King of Ning.

87
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,000
I have a bad reputation,

88
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,150
and I'm dying soon.

89
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,950
If I support Yi Xin to ascend the throne,

90
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,710
it will surely cause controversy

91
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,670
and affect the foundation of our country.

92
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,930
It's better to arrange everything well.

93
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,690
Then I can die in peace.

94
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,110
The 10 cities in Ning State

95
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,990
are my final gifts for

96
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,590
Yi Xin's coronation.

97
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,340
Wars are cruel.

98
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,320
The civilians have to suffer a lot.

99
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,550
You said our Ning State

100
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,110
had taken 10 cities from you.

101
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,710
But with the disputes between
our two countries over these years,

102
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,970
Li State has also taken
cities from our country, hasn't it?

103
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,390
If just like you, every generation

104
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,590
of rulers had been

105
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,710
solely focused on reclaiming something,

106
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,150
would the wars ever end?

107
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,790
There's no need to

108
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,590
explain these principles to me.

109
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,750
The King of Ning and
Prime Minister Yue are kind-hearted.

110
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,710
Why don't you just

111
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,510
return the 10 cities to Li State?

112
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,750
Then I'll order the troops to
withdraw immediately.

113
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,710
I think it would be more convenient

114
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,370
if we strangle you, the Crown Prince.

115
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,430
At this point,

116
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,270
whether to withdraw the troops or not,

117
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,070
I'm afraid

118
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,630
it's not up to

119
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,630
the Crown Prince.

120
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,950
As for the plan with Jiang Yunqing,

121
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,470
I've misjudged it indeed.

122
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,620
You've been using her
all this time, haven't you?

123
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,150
When did it start?

124
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,390
You said you would help her

125
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,790
restore the Former Ning.

126
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,630
I would restore the Former Ning?

127
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,490
Did you really believe in

128
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,470
what she said?

129
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,640
She agreed to help me

130
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:39,909
only because

131
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,150
I had poisoned her with poisonous insects.

132
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,150
If she doesn't want to endure

133
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,550
that excruciating pain,

134
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,710
she can only yield to me

135
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,770
and obey my every command.

136
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,030
You...

137
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,310
It looks like love can indeed

138
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,540
blind people.

139
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,430
Even you, Yue Chi, have been misled

140
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,960
in your judgment of others.

141
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,670
You couldn't even sense that

142
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,130
she was an impostor.

143
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,610
Not long after I returned to Li State,

144
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,400
I heard that the former Empress's

145
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,120
daughter had been found.

146
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,790
What did you say?

147
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,950
The newly appointed

148
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,150
Princess Changping of the Ning Dynasty

149
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,990
is the daughter of the former Empress?

150
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,250
It's absolutely true.

151
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,110
How is that possible?

152
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,310
Back then, my father

153
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,570
ordered a night raid on Cheng'en Temple.

154
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,630
He intended to capture the Princess
and the Empress alive,

155
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,510
but they only found

156
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,909
their corpses in the end.

157
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,190
Now her corpse is still there,

158
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,030
but she's alive?

159
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,440
What's the reason for that?

160
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,940
What a good chance to manipulate her!

161
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,790
My poisonous worms

162
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,710
could finally be useful, too.

163
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,130
Come on. Cheers, everyone.

164
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,910
Princess Changping.

165
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,600
What's the matter?

166
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,900
Don't be so aloof.

167
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,470
I specially came here for you,

168
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,960
the fake princess of the Ning Dynasty.

169
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,350
I suppose

170
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,350
the fake princess

171
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,789
needs some real things to

172
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,120
maintain her identity.

173
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,830
For example,

174
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,309
my worm poison.

175
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,310
So you mean

176
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,970
Jiang Yunqing...

177
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,790
No.

178
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,350
She's Xue Jingguan.

179
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,390
Prime Minister Yue, there's no need
to be angry with me

180
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,450
about this matter.

181
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,630
I've already done so much,

182
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,510
but I still haven't
gained control over her.

183
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,350
Xue Jingguan

184
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,080
has never been a simple person.

185
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,730
Otherwise, how could she just
stand by and watch me,

186
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,990
who has been controlling

187
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,550
her life, get abducted?

188
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,500
She's even willing to risk

189
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,420
her own life.

190
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,510
It's evident that this woman

191
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,510
is unscrupulous.

192
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,110
It's possible that

193
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,710
when the Cheng'en Temple Incident
happened back then,

194
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,640
she took the chance to make it worse

195
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,670
and seized the opportunity to steal

196
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,270
the Jiang family's heirloom

197
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,310
to risk her life

198
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,240
for a lifetime of wealth and honor.

199
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,070
As a mere farmer's daughter,

200
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,990
she infiltrated the capital

201
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,250
and became a princess.

202
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,770
If the Former Ning had not fallen,

203
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,590
with her ability to manipulate situations,

204
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,750
her prospect might not
have been like this.

205
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,110
This woman's capabilities

206
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,470
are rare in the world.

207
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,830
To be honest,

208
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,390
I even admire her to some extent.

209
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,430
Yue Chi, oh, Yue Chi.

210
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,910
If you had not

211
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,520
broken off the marriage with her,

212
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,320
you might

213
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,630
have ended up

214
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,030
with a different fate.

215
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,080
What you said

216
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,790
is not impartial.

217
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,790
I don't think

218
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,040
you've ever seen

219
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,390
her true self.

220
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,190
The person you've described

221
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,270
bears no resemblance to her.

222
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,560
In my mind, she's a woman

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,130
who values loyalty and is courageous.

224
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,390
She remains aloof from
the world and is resilient,

225
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,470
being able to bear

226
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,670
all hardships alone.

227
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,030
Back then, the princess stayed

228
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,360
in the Changmen Forest.

229
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,630
But it was you who died.

230
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,990
Are you going to

231
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,780
atone for this for the rest of your life?

232
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,190
That's also why

233
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,030
I want to protect her
for the rest of my life.

234
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,040
What I care about and admire

235
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,470
has never been

236
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,310
her identity or bloodline as the princess.

237
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,380
Your Majesty, if everything is settled,

238
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,510
I'll set off two bundles of fireworks.

239
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,110
Your Highness, when we leave here later,

240
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,550
I'll ask someone to

241
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,520
escort you back to Li State.

242
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,270
Before that,

243
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,750
there's one more thing

244
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,150
I want you to help me with.

245
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,390
She doesn't even want

246
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,590
her own life anymore.

247
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,110
I also don't plan to continue using

248
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,040
poisonous insects to control her.

249
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,350
I'll do you one more favor

250
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,750
as a gesture of goodwill.

251
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,670
After I leave here safely,

252
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,250
I'll certainly give her the antidote.

253
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,200
It looks like

254
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,790
I must ensure that

255
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,430
you can leave here safely.

256
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,580
Giddy-up!

257
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,570
Your Majesty.

258
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,770
We arrived late.

259
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,890
The rebels have all been

260
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,820
captured or dispersed.

261
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,810
But the Princess and the Crown Prince
from the previous dynasty have escaped.

262
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,210
Please punish us, Your Majesty.

263
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,450
The incident happened suddenly.

264
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,050
You've already done quite well.

265
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,950
Get up.

266
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,330
Your Highness.

267
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,020
I said

268
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,130
I would make sure that
you could leave safely.

269
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,730
Wei Zhang.

270
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,090
Prime Minister Yue.

271
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,590
-Giddy-up!
-Giddy-up!

272
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,550
Commander, are you alright?

273
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,410
I'm fine.

274
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,620
It's no big deal.

275
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,010
The Qilin Army has appeared.

276
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:47,890
I'm afraid the capital will soon

277
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,890
receive the news.

278
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,370
It looks like

279
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,490
a bloody war is inevitable.

280
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,230
What are you thinking, Your Highness?

281
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,230
What the King of Ning and Yue Chi said

282
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,790
is not entirely wrong.

283
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,310
[With the monarch's serenity,
the country will be at peace.]

284
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,610
That day in the cave,

285
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,250
he could have easily

286
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,410
killed me.

287
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,190
Then Li State would have been in chaos,

288
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,540
and Ning State could have
launched a full-scale attack.

289
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,270
He could have even

290
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,400
taken advantage of occupying Li State

291
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,430
to conquer the Huaye State at one stroke,

292
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,250
target the east coast of Qin Sea directly

293
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,150
and expand their territory to the maximum.

294
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,370
But he didn't do that.

295
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,530
What he cherishes

296
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,480
is the current Ning State's

297
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,310
long-awaited stability.

298
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,530
But...

299
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,850
But...

300
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,850
But reclaiming the 10 cities

301
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,530
is still an urgent task.

302
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,270
Your Highness.

303
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,610
The geographical locations of

304
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,410
the 10 cities in Qiongzhou are special.

305
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,070
In Li State, they are the areas

306
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,210
with the least natural disasters
and pest infestations.

307
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,000
Now,

308
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,050
as long as the Yuming Worms
are not eliminated,

309
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,330
and the 10 cities are still
occupied by our enemy,

310
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,410
it means that

311
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,900
Li State won't be able

312
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,330
to harvest even a single

313
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,490
plump grain of food.

314
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,510
I wonder how much food is
left in Li State.

315
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,870
Huo Jingheng talked about

316
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,330
so many grand principles.

317
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,520
But can he solve

318
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,490
Li State's practical problems?

319
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,530
Xue Jingguan.

320
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,470
You're being too presumptuous.

321
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,450
Do you remember who has been

322
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,780
controlling your life?

323
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,870
I haven't gotten even with you

324
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,970
for what happened on the Xidu Bridge.

325
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,210
The three top generals of
the Kingdom Restoration League?

326
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,440
Your Highness, I advise you

327
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,930
not to act rashly.

328
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,490
Otherwise,

329
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,050
if the Crown Prince of a kingdom

330
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,450
silently

331
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,730
dies here,

332
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,970
wouldn't it be such a pity?

333
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,140
Have you guys forgotten who

334
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,340
brought you back from the battlefield?

335
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,730
Without me,

336
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,210
the Kingdom Restoration League
wouldn't have existed.

337
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,700
It's really ridiculous.

338
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,450
These are the people of our Ning State.

339
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,330
They want to restore Ning State's
legitimate sovereignty.

340
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,410
Do you think

341
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,370
they'll obey the orders

342
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,230
from the Crown Prince of Li State?

343
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,340
Your Highness,

344
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,690
I guess you also don't want

345
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,370
the Former Ning to unite
with the current Ning State

346
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,770
and attack Li State, huh?

347
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,290
Xue Jingguan.

348
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,350
I've really underestimated you.

349
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,170
Once I return to Li State,

350
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,980
I will gather a large army

351
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,560
and start the war immediately.

352
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,410
Good.

353
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,250
I will bring people

354
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,890
to join you in 10 days.

355
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,530
The people of Li will also
be grateful to you

356
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,420
for choosing

357
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,410
the right path.

358
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,810
Xue Jingguan.

359
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,210
Before Yue Chi left,

360
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,580
he asked me for your antidote.

361
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,840
To me,

362
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,600
a man's pity

363
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,220
is the most useless thing.

364
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,099
Your Highness, please also remember that

365
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,560
from now on,

366
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,829
there's only an alliance between us.

367
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,569
We are no longer master and servant.

368
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,480
[Fengyuan Hall]

369
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,280
Your Majesty.

370
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,550
There's a military rebellion in Li State.

371
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,490
The rebel army has already gone through

372
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,310
the Yumen Pass.

373
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,090
Right now,

374
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,280
the eastern and southern

375
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,110
vassal kings all want to rebel, too.

376
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,290
Dispatching troops

377
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,810
is a matter of the utmost urgency now,

378
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,610
Your Majesty.

379
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,610
Your Majesty.

380
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,800
Here's a request from the Ministry of War.

381
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,410
Your Majesty, please issue
a decree immediately

382
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,730
to dispatch 20,000
elite soldiers northward

383
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,930
and also recruit another

384
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,590
5,000 soldiers from across the country

385
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,050
to suppress the vassal kings.

386
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,580
If we recruit soldiers now,

387
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,160
I'm afraid we'll be short-handed.

388
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,530
Your Majesty.

389
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,270
In the Battle of Xidu Bridge,

390
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,570
the Qilin Army once

391
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,630
saved Your Majesty, didn't it?

392
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,250
Right now,

393
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,010
it's just the time to use them.

394
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,020
No way.

395
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,700
Since Yue Chi has maintained
his own army privately,

396
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,030
it can be considered as treason.

397
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,960
How can we use the Qilin Army again?

398
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,930
These people must be punished.

399
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,860
Your Majesty.

400
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,770
I agree. I agree with that.

401
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,880
These 1,000 or so men under my command

402
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,990
quit being soldiers a long time ago

403
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,100
and were scattered around the city.

404
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,450
They can hardly be called
soldiers anymore.

405
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,930
The title of Qilin Army

406
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,260
has long become history
of the previous dynasty.

407
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,330
Indeed.

408
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,450
In the households of ministers,

409
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,650
who doesn't have a few personal guards?

410
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,350
The Yue family has been in
high-ranking positions for generations.

411
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,970
The soldiers who once
worked for the Yue family

412
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,250
are naturally countless.

413
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,190
How can this be considered

414
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,570
as evidence of treason?

415
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,730
Your Majesty.

416
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,910
Everyone knows that

417
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,170
the Qilin Army is proficient in warfare.

418
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,010
During times of great chaos,

419
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,610
they even once fought against

420
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,940
Your Majesty's troops.

421
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,050
You're telling me that those are

422
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,910
ordinary guards?

423
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,580
Your Majesty, the military
situation is urgent.

424
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,090
Please issue a decree  immediately

425
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,510
to dispatch troops northward
and resist the enemy.

426
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,410
Your Majesty.

427
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,410
In my opinion,

428
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,200
Yue Chi

429
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,200
has secretly kept elite troops
and a large quantity of armaments.

430
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,460
He should be punished.

431
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,590
And with the Yue family's

432
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,770
crimes from the previous dynasty,

433
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,930
the Qilin Army

434
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,090
should be completely exterminated.

435
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:14,970
Yes.

436
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,770
We should also confiscate
all the Yue family's

437
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,770
private property

438
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,500
for our state

439
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,290
to buy military provisions.

440
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,090
Guards.

441
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,090
Dismiss

442
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,330
Yue Chi from his post as Prime Minister.

443
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,410
Put him in the imperial prison.

444
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,610
Your Majesty is wise!

445
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:14,680
Bad news.

446
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,610
[Prince Anle's Mansion]

447
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,610
Just now, I overheard

448
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,070
two officials saying that

449
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,130
the ministers requested

450
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,610
His Majesty to execute Master Yue

451
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,470
and capture the Qilin Army immediately.

452
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,980
His Majesty

453
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,610
seemed to be wavering.

454
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,810
The Commander has risked
his own life for him

455
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,050
and racked his brains.

456
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,730
What an ungrateful villain.

457
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,490
He intended to kill

458
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,480
officials of the imperial court.

459
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,880
Yue Chi is truly rebelling.

460
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,290
Now Lord Wang and Lord Qian

461
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,560
are both injured and bedridden.

462
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,080
The physical evidence is here.

463
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,670
Your Majesty, please convict him at once.

464
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,100
Your Majesty, please convict Yue Chi

465
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,730
to quell the public's anger.

466
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,570
Your Majesty.

467
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,590
The Qilin Army raided the prison.

468
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,970
What are you doing?

469
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,310
The Emperor wants to kill you.

470
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,050
Come with me now!

471
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,090
Who told you that?

472
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,030
There's no time to explain.

473
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,970
Come with me now!

474
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,730
His Majesty is here!

475
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,170
Yue Chi!

476
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,870
You're using your personal
guards to break out of prison.

477
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,670
What punishment do you deserve?

478
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,650
I've been

479
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,520
behaving well in prison.

480
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,580
They must have believed in

481
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,310
the slanderous remarks of evil people,

482
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,870
which led to such rash actions.

483
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,650
Your Majesty, please
investigate thoroughly.

484
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,310
Your Majesty, now the
evidence is irrefutable.

485
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,650
The facts are right in front of your eyes.

486
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,480
How can you still believe in

487
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,010
Yue Chi's deceiving words?

488
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,610
Don't force me.

489
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,410
Your Majesty, please

490
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,670
eliminate the rebels.

491
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,800
Your Majesty, please eliminate the rebels.

492
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,730
Yue Chi!

493
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,430
Back then, in the imperial court,

494
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,490
you kept saying that

495
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,330
you would never use the Qilin Army again.

496
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,650
Are you trying to rebel now?

497
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,090
The Qilin Army

498
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,100
absolutely has no intention of rebellion.

499
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,340
This matter started because of me alone,

500
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,600
and I'll bear the responsibility myself

501
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,940
in exchange for sparing
the lives of the Qilin Army.

502
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,090
All the Qilin soldiers here

503
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,130
should be killed!

504
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,810

505
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,890
I believe that you've

506
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,810
always been loyal to me.

507
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,940
But now that I am
the Emperor of Ning State,

508
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,490
I have no choice but to eliminate

509
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,890

510
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,490

512
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,410
This stupid Emperor is clearly

513
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,340
an ungrateful villain.

514
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,400

Your Highness saved my life.

568
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,810
I have no way to repay you.

569
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,830
How can you have no way to repay me?

570
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,770
Yue Chi.

571
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,570
You are a rare elite.

572
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,160
Now that Huo Jingheng has
treated you like that,

573
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,090
don't you want to get even with him?

574
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,430
But Ling'er is still in the palace.

575
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,130
Since I had a way

576
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,140
to send Wen Rou into the palace,

577
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,290
I can surely find a way
to get your sister out.

578
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,200
But I'm still a citizen of Ning after all.

579
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,130
Ning?

580
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,710
The Ning State you've been

581
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,570
so loyal to

582
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,070
has taken everything from you now.

583
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,210
Your family's reputation,

584
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,170
your buddies' lives

585
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,130
and your sister's freedom.

586
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,930
It's all because of Huo Jingheng.

587
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,090
Yue Chi.

588
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,570
I promise you that

589
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,610
after I reclaim the 10 cities
in Qiongzhou,

590
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,070
I will withdraw my troops.

591
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,480
I won't kill the innocent civilians.

592
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,490
Really?

593
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,210
With my identity as
the Crown Prince of Li State,

594
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,290
I guarantee it.

595
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,070
But I have one more request.

596
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,250
After you and I

597
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,530
capture Huo Jingheng,

598
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,890
let me deal with him personally.

599
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,570
I'm going to take revenge for

600
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,830
my buddies from the Qilin Army by myself.

601
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,730
Alright.

602
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,770
Yue Chi, you're good at
both civil and military affairs.

603
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,770
You're not only a top talent of Ning,

604
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,770
but the people of our Li State

605
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,790
will also respect and support you.

606
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,290
When you recover from your injuries,

607
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,490
I will appoint you as the prince regent.

608
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,530
Our Li State

609
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,660
will be the arena for you
to fully exert your talents.

610
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,940
Greetings, Your Excellency.

611
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,970
Send a troop to go through the canyon

612
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,520
and occupy the high ground.

613
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,320
When the Ning Army advances

614
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,510
and reaches this low-lying area,

615
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,250
we can ambush them.

616
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,210
One!

617
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,000
Two!

618
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,530
Three!

619
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,130
Four!

620
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,250
One!

621
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,450
Two!

622
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,490
Three!

623
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,570
Four!

624
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,980
We can also arrange for a troop to advance

625
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,170
and occupy this military position.

626
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,040
The Kingdom Restoration League
can provide support at any time.

627
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
What do you think?

628
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,250
Alright.

629
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,840
My Lady, please slow down.

630
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,370
Be careful not to fall.

631
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,010
Consort Yue.

632
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,290
Where are you going in such a hurry?

633
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,850
I'm going to beg the Empress Dowager.

634
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,490
Why are you going to
beg the Empress Dowager?

635
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,690
It's about my brother's incident. I...

636
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,390
You can just leave me here.

637
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,450
Get back to work.

638
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,170
I've just come out of
the Empress Dowager's palace.

639
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,250
The news from the Empress Dowager is that

640
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,450
your brother escaped from the capital

641
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,310
and went north.

642
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,980
Now he has defected to Li State.

643
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,250
And he's about to attack Ning

644
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,170
with Yi Qingyun.

645
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,630
You're talking nonsense!

646
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,660
My brother would never do such a thing.

647
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,610
Your brother wouldn't do it indeed.

648
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,730
But now we've all

649
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,770
fallen into someone else's trap.

650
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,770
Trap?

651
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,010
What trap?

652
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,610
It's such a pity that
the Qilin Army's identity

653
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,210
has been exposed.

654
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,710
The Qilin Army rashly attempted to
get him out of prison.

655
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,040
That was instigated by someone.

656
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,330
Those were all traps.

657
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,770
The purpose was to force your brother

658
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,370
into a desperate situation.

659
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,970
Was it Yi Qingyun?

660
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,290
Yes.

661
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,230
But not really, either,

662
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:24,880
At a time like this,

663
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,390
just don't keep me guessing.

664
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,930
Tell me who it was.

665
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,930
It was Jiang Yunqing, who is

666
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,610
the fake princess
and your brother's fiancée.

667
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,670
How is that possible?

668
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,160
The Qilin Army's rebellion was suspicious.

669
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,500
After the Empress Dowager
learned about this matter,

670
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,000
she immediately sent people
to investigate it.

671
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,380
Only then did we discover that Yunqing

672
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,820
was actually an impostor.

673
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,890
Moreover,

674
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,700
the news that Yue Chi would be executed

675
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,760
was also deliberately spread by her.

676
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,810
She wouldn't do that.

677
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,570
My brother and Yunqing

678
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,970
love each other so deeply.

679
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,770
She wouldn't put my brother

680
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,680
in mortal danger.

681
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,060
I think she must have

682
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:03,910
her own reason.

683
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:04,880
What's more, last time,

684
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,770
when she abducted me,

685
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,170
she didn't hurt me at all.

686
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,980
She's not that kind of person.

687
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,640
No matter what reason she has,

688
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,760
she shouldn't have done

689
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,630
such a rebellious thing

690
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,450
to betray her country and family.

691
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,230
The Empress Dowager has sent people

692
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,260
to search for this woman.

693
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,530
Once they find her,

694
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,770
she will be killed.

695
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,610
I don't believe she would do such a thing.

696
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,220
I need to find her
and figure out the truth.

697
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,640
Based on just your few words,

698
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,560
you can just sentence her to death?

699
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,760
Don't be impulsive.

700
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,890
Her martial arts skills are very good.

701
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,090
What if you get hurt?

702
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,170
She won't hurt me.

703
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,370
But without

704
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,770
the permission from His Majesty
and the Empress Dowager

705
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,300
you can't leave the palace.

706
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,890
I can beg the Empress Dowager

707
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,400
to allow me to go to
Cheng'en Temple alone

708
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,600
to pray for my husband

709
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,380
and repent for my brother.

710
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,270
If you insist on going,

711
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,010
as it's difficult to travel
to the northwest area,

712
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:58,940
I'll go with you.

713
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,080
Jiang Yunqing always appears
and disappears mysteriously.

714
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,570
Where can we find her?

715
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,690
I know a place.

716
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,810
I guess she might be hiding there.

717
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,050
Alright. I'll do as you say.

718
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,120
It's fine if you can't ride a horse.

719
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,449
But you even have motion sickness from it.

720
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,570
I'm fine.

721
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,929
Finding Yunqing is more important.

722
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:33,010
Giddy-up!

723
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,670
Giddy-up!

724
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,370
Uncle Liu?

725
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,170
Why is he here?

726
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,370
What's wrong, Ling'er?

727
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,890
Yunqing.

728
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,730
Ling'er.

729
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,730
Yunqing.

730
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,690
The Empress Dowager has issued a decree.

731
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,410
They're searching for you everywhere.

732
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,790
So I thought

733
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,050
you might be here.

734
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,290
Then I came to take a look.

735
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,690
You shouldn't have come.

736
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,160
At that time, the Qilin Army

737
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,370
was incited by others

738
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,210
and thought my brother
would be executed soon.

739
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,090
They...

740
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,010
They all said it was you
who spread this news.

741
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:37,940
It was me indeed.

742
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,050
You know what?

743
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,530
Yue Chi was arrested for treason.

744
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,670
Yue Chi?

745
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,160
That Yue Chi?

746
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,490
He was arrested?

747
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,020
He was finally arrested.

748
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,670
Yue Chi deserved to be arrested.

749
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:01,970
Yunqing.

750
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,330
Why?

751
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,410
Did my brother let you down,

752
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,340
or did someone force you to do that?

753
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,770
It's okay, Yunqing.

754
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,930
If you have any difficulties
that you can't speak of,

755
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,010
you can tell me.

756
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,930
I'm Consort Yue now.

757
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,740
I have the power to help you.

758
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,890
Ling'er.

759
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,830
My relationship with Yue Chi is over.

760
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,580
How can you just give up on

761
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,010
your many years of
relationship with my brother?

762
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,570
I can even give up on myself,

763
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,810
let alone him.

764
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,610
As a citizen of Ning,

765
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,250
I have to help our country
arrest people like you,

766
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,010
who have strayed from the right path

767
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,570
and betrayed your country and family.

768
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,140
But now,

769
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,140
for Ling'er's sake,

770
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:41,920
I'll let you off this time.

771
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
But in the future,

772
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,900
if you dare to do anything

773
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,870
to hurt Yue Chi and Ling'er,

774
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,090
I won't let you off.

775
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,530
It's Jiang Yunqing. Shoot arrows!

776
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,890
Don't!

777
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,770
I'm the Imperial Uncle.

778
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,970
Consort Yue and I are both here.

779
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,590
I'd like to see who dares to do it.

780
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,720
Put down the arrows.

781
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,650
Yunqing.

782
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,050
Just leave.

783
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,850
Let's go, Ling'er.

784
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,920
Let's go back to the palace.

785
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,720
I'm not going back to the palace.

786
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,280
Then where are you going?

787
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:01,950
Are you going to look for her?

788
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:02,650
Yes.

789
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,970
Now that's the only clue

790
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,250
to find my brother.

791
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,750
Then why didn't you chase her just now?

792
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,990
If I had chased her just now,

793
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,330
would she let me do so?

794
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,630
I was wondering why you

795
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,730
let her go just now.

796
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,240
I really couldn't

797
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,170
bear to see Yunqing

798
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,970
die right in front of me.

799
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,330
However,

800
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,550
since Yue Chi is working with Yi Qingyun,

801
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,690
she's very likely to appear at

802
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,960
the border between Li and Ning.

803
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,850
Do you know

804
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,450
if we want to go to

805
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,350
the border, we'll have to

806
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,220
climb very hight mountains

807
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,470
and cross very deep sea?

808
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,930
Can you and I do that alone?

809
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,970
No matter what,

810
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,530
I must find my brother.

811
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,770
Wait!

812
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,490
I'll go get the horses right away.

813
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,220
Is that okay?

814
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,170
You don't know anything,

815
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,830
and you still want to go alone?

816
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,340
Guys, you can go back first.

817
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,050
I will

818
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:47,810
report this matter to

819
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,290
His Majesty and the Empress Dowager.

820
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:49,850
Yes.

821
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,310
Look. Haven't we caught up with her?

822
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,690
At least, we caught up with her

823
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,290
before we might get killed.

824
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,370
Why don't we also take a break?

825
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,270
I really can't endure it anymore.

826
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,330
Yunqing stood up.

827
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,940
Is she about to leave?

828
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,450
This is not okay.

829
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,330
I need to drink some water.

830
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,390
Just a sip of water.

831
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,850
There's no time for drinking water.

832
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,750
Don't drink. There's no time for it.

833
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,790
Let's keep up with her.

834
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,570
Giddy-up!

835
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:32,930
Giddy-up!

836
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,990
This witch...

837
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,410
Du Tianzhao!

838
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,630
Idiots.

839
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,650
Yunqing has gone far.

840
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,630
Hurry up. Let's catch up with her.

841
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,690
Alright.
