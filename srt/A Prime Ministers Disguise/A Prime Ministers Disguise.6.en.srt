00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,840
[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,940
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,400
Here's the Empress Dowager's decree.

4
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,280
[Tianwei Gate]

5
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,680
An assassin attempted to kill His Majesty.

6
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,310
Seal the palace gate
and capture the assassin!

7
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:15,950
Oh, no.

8
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,230
Will anything bad happen to the Commander?

9
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,770
There's a grand banquet
at the palace today.

10
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,820
If my brother's identity is exposed,

11
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,500
even His Majesty won't be
able to protect him forcefully.

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,690
Then let's fight our way in

13
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,880
and rescue the Commander.

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,380
Don't act recklessly, you all.

15
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,590
Ling'er, calm down.

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,080
I'll go into the palace and check for you.

17
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,090
Are you sure you can do it?

18
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,890
I have to do it, whether I can or not.

19
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,650
I'm the most well-connected man in Ning.

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,509
No matter what,

21
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,070
I will save your brother for you.

22
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,100
Just stay here.

23
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,130
Let's discuss other matters later.

24
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:42,910
Open the gate.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,800
God, please bless us.

26
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,490
I hope my brother can be safe.

27
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,280
I hope Tianzhao can

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,160
also be safe.

29
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,650
Your Grace,

30
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,670
I have important matters to report.

31
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,120
Before His Majesty was attacked,

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,560
I saw Consort Yue

33
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,860
secretly meeting with a palace maid.

34
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,370
Their behavior was suspicious.

35
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,320
After that, His Majesty was attacked.

36
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,890
This assassin pretended
to be a palace maid.

37
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,390
I suspect that this assassination

38
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,200
was secretly planned by Consort Yue.

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,630
Her purpose was to take revenge for

40
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,000
the deceased Prince Anle, namely Yue Chi.

41
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,030
To take revenge for Yue Chi?

42
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,180
Let's go to the Fengluan Palace!

43
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,850
Yes.

44
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,600
Your Highness!

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,550
This is...

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,660
Yue.

47
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,910
Am I still your master?

48
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,710
Of course.

49
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,790
Then don't ask anything.

50
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,800
Close the palace gate for me.

51
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,200
Don't open it for anyone.

52
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,710
Yunqing.

53
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,350
Open the palace gate.

54
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,450
Tell them Consort Yue has been
taken hostage by the assassin.

55
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,840
Ask the imperial guards to rescue her.

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,770
As a woman, don't make things
difficult for another woman.

57
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,630
Your Highness,

58
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,940
whose orders should I follow?

59
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,760
Yunqing.

60
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,490
Things have come to this point.

61
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,090
We can't all die here.

62
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,620
You had the courage to enter the palace
to assassinate him so many times.

63
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,050
You even had the courage to
enter the palace to rescue me.

64
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,290
Don't you have the courage to
stick with me through thick and thin?

65
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,350
This is different.

66
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,780
I can't be your burden anymore.

67
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,820
Trust me.

68
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,000
If I can just stall for a moment,

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Huo Jingheng will surely
come here to protect me.

70
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,910
You still trust him?

71
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,310
It's not that I trust him.

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,270
It's just that I'm still useful to him.

73
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,370
The Empress Dowager is here!

74
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,540
Yunqing.

75
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,630
I'm your future husband after all.

76
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,860
You must listen to me.

77
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,010
Hide yourself well.

78
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,410
I'll handle everything.

79
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,610
Husband?

80
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,590
Yue.

81
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,910
Take her to the inner hall.

82
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,750
Still use all your strength
to block the door.

83
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,840
Don't open it for anyone.

84
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,700
Did you hear me?

85
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,370
Yes, Your Highness.

86
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,770
Yue Chi.

87
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,600
Let's go.

88
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,490
Your Grace.

89
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,080
Just now, I merely

90
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,850
embarrassed myself at the banquet.

91
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,390
Why do you all bother to
come here and check on me?

92
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,240
Consort Yue.

93
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,550
His Majesty was attacked at the banquet.

94
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,269
Consort Hui has accused you of
meeting privately with the assassin.

95
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,300
This matter concerns His Majesty's safety.

96
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,740
I have to check
the Fengluan Palace thoroughly.

97
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,040
Huo Jingheng.

98
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,840
Where are you?

99
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,190
When I usually try to escape,

100
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,750
you chase me faster than a rabbit.

101
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,280
Today, when I'm in trouble,

102
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,990
why haven't you shown up yet?

103
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,900
Search!

104
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,040
Yes.

105
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,590
Stop!

106
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,159
His Majesty is here.

107
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,000
Are you alright?

108
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,990
Don't let our precious one get hurt.

109
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,230
What precious one?

110
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,300
There is a precious thing?

111
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,220
Precious one?

112
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,290
Your precious one?

113
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,740
What's your precious thing
on Consort Yue's body?

114
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,480
Mother,

115
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,290
Consort Yue's health status
is different now.

116
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,850
She can't endure any shock.

117
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,120
That's why I've deliberately

118
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,890
concealed the assassination from her.

119
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,490
I specially allowed her to
return to the palace for a rest.

120
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,710
Mother, why do you have to

121
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,840
make such a big fuss about this matter?

122
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,650
Your Majesty.

123
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,500
Consort Yue.

124
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,409
You're pregnant?

125
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,650
So she's really pregnant?

126
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,070
She's pregnant?

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,740
What nonsense are you talking about?

128
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,920
Weren't you hoping for me
to come and help you out?

129
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,330
Will she believe it?

130
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,159
You'd better cooperate.

131
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,420
I'll ensure the safety of
the person in your inner hall.

132
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,830
Your Grace.

133
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,320
No wonder.

134
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,130
When I saw the Emperor
sending those imperial guards

135
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,340
to follow Consort Yue so conspicuously,

136
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,690
I thought it was inappropriate.

137
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,950
But now it looks like

138
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,300
it's quite necessary indeed.

139
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,810
Your Grace,

140
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,100
perhaps I didn't see things
clearly just now.

141
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,360
As it concerns the imperial heir,

142
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,010
no ambiguity is allowed.

143
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,700
It's important to summon the imperial
doctor to check her pulse.

144
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,540
I'll accept punishment
from you afterwards.

145
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,740
Consort Hui is right.

146
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,210
We can't delay.

147
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,990
Summon the imperial doctor!

148
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,100
I'll go right away.

149
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,440
What's going on?

150
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,110
Did others raid this place?

151
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,830
Oh, no.

152
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,490
Why are you here?

153
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,170
I'm here to save someone

154
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,370
and kill the Emperor.

155
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,480
She said she's here to kill the Emperor?

156
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,270
His Majesty ordered me
to escort this woman away.

157
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,690
If I encounter you on the way,

158
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,620
I can hand her over to you directly.

159
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,360
Thank you, Lord Du.

160
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,830
It's already hard for me to help Yue Chi.

161
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,430
How come I also have to
look after this troublemaker?

162
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,490
I'll take my leave.

163
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,650
If you're unwilling to do this,

164
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,440
let go of me.

165
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,110
I'll try to kill him again.

166
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,480
Tell me

167
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,000
what happened inside there.

168
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,130
Something serious.

169
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,020
What happened?

170
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,330
Yue Chi

171
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,930
is pregnant.

172
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,830
Dr. Gong.

173
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,840
My beloved consort is pregnant.

174
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,360
It's important.

175
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,270
Speak carefully.

176
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,510
This pulse...

177
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,670
This pulse is...

178
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,670
Is she pregnant or not?

179
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,140
Your Majesty,

180
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,270
it is indeed a pregnancy pulse.

181
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,300
I have never seen

182
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,350
such a strong pregnancy pulse before.

183
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,840
Sister,

184
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,390
it is really a pregnancy pulse.

185
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,050
It's a good fetus, Your Grace.

186
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,020
I knew it.

187
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,330
It was a misunderstanding just now.

188
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,809
Congratulations, Your Grace.

189
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:35,640
Mother.

190
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,559
It's getting late.

191
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,360
Consort Yue should rest now.

192
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,190
That's right.

193
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,900
Why are you all standing there?

194
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,140
Leave at once.

195
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,090
I'll leave, too.

196
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,560
Alright.

197
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,200
Consort Yue.

198
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,030
Don't get up.

199
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,650
I'll see Mother out for you.

200
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,510
You don't need to see me out, either.

201
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,850
I can go out by myself.

202
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,220
Yue.

203
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,200
Escort my mother back to her palace.

204
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

205
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,720
I'm leaving.

206
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,690
Dr. Gong.

207
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,250
Your Majesty.

208
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,610
Regarding today's matter,

209
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,900
I'll certainly keep it confidential.

210
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,330
No matter who asks me,

211
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,130
I'll say that Consort Yue is pregnant.

212
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,070
You have worked in the
palace for a long time.

213
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,730
You've always been loyal to your master.

214
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,690
Now that you are old,

215
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,660
you should go home and rest.

216
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,600
Loyalty should be maintained
from beginning to end.

217
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,500
Wei Zhang.

218
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,040
Escort Dr. Gong on his way.

219
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,140
Yes.

220
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,940
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

221
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,740
Your Majesty, please spare
my life! Your Majesty!

222
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,670
Your Majesty!

223
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,420
Your Majesty!

224
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,570
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

225
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,010
He'll just be sent to Jiangnan
to live his later life, won't he?

226
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,340
Why is he so frightened?

227
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
When you're looking at me like that,

228
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,360
I can't bear it.

229
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,330
Why did you lie, Your Majesty?

230
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,910
Did I lie?

231
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,020
I was referring to all the
treasures in your palace.

232
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,890
How dare you play tricks on me?

233
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,380
Unexpectedly, my mother misunderstood it.

234
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,900
Would the imperial doctor
also misunderstand it?

235
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,690
In the Imperial Medical Office,

236
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,930
not all of them are
highly skilled doctors.

237
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,180
Misdiagnoses happen frequently.

238
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,960
You've solved my urgent problem.

239
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,360
I should thank you for your great kindness.

240
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,510
The friendship

241
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,880
between us is profound.

242
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,270
Your friends are also my friends.

243
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Don't mention it.

244
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,150
Is it a profound friendship

245
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,360
or a long-planned scheme?

246
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,680
You've truly reached a high level.

247
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,360
You're aware of everything,

248
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,220
but you never show your feelings.

249
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,210
Just like a snake in the grass,

250
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,150
you've been planning each step carefully.

251
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,280
These words of yours

252
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,910
have really made me sad.

253
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,390
I've always been sincere to you.

254
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,290
And I hide nothing from you.

255
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,410
Then why don't you start from
the beginning and tell me

256
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,840
why you summoned me
to the palace at first?

257
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,380
Because

258
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,530
I want Yue Chi.

259
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,170
He's already dead.

260
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,570
Why do you still want him?

261
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:47,960
Yes.

262
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,270
He's dead indeed.

263
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,850
But don't I still have you?

264
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,600
I want Yue Chi

265
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,850
to be truly used by me

266
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,440
and help me overcome
the obstacles in court

267
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,970
so as to bring peace to Ning.

268
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,550
Without him,

269
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,830
it's fine to have you.

270
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,060
I want you to truly become
my capable minister

271
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,680
and strategist.

272
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,690
I'm terrified.

273
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,100
I don't know how to do that.

274
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,500
You're being too modest.

275
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,510
You've inherited your
brother's true talent.

276
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,940
The matter of reducing the power
of the vassal kings is the proof of that.

277
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,450
You've misjudged it.

278
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,150
I just got lucky.

279
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,870
If your luck is so good,

280
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,790
why don't you try your luck again?

281
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,000
Who would so actively force someone
to become an official?

282
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,520
I can't bear such a burden.

283
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,470
Then I'll stay in this Fengluan Palace.

284
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,200
When you're ready to bear the burden,

285
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,660
I'll leave.

286
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,720
He's kicking me.

287
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,120
I'm pregnant.

288
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,810
I really shouldn't get tired.

289
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,610
Your Majesty, please go back.

290
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,710
Your Majesty.

291
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,330
The imperial heir is the most important.

292
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,660
We must not be careless.

293
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,680
Alright.

294
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,310
We have plenty of time.

295
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,620
Consort Yue, take care and rest well.

296
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,550
It's just as I expected.

297
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,670
It looks like he has been

298
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,640
playing dumb while knowing everything.

299
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,850
He must have known my identity long ago.

300
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,600
Dog Huo

301
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,230
has been fooling me.

302
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,650
Consort Yue is pregnant.

303
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,570
If Huo Jingheng has an heir,

304
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,440
the situation will become
very unfavorable.

305
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,900
Brother, please make preparations sooner.

306
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,020
Du Tianzhao.

307
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,320
Yunqing's injuries have been treated.

308
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,150
Just tell me

309
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,950
what's going on with my brother.

310
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,540
He's pregnant.

311
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,320
He's pregnant?

312
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,800
Whose baby is it?

313
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,220
My nephew's.

314
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,750
He said it himself.

315
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,350
His words are as good as gold.

316
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,870
It's all my fault.

317
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,490
I've caused so much trouble.

318
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,790
Indeed.

319
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,720
What method do you think that is?

320
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,560
Is His Majesty going to
come clean with Yue Chi?

321
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,240
That's right.

322
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,630
Everyone else is smart.

323
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,450
Why are you the only foolish one?

324
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,800
I was clearly helping to
bring them together, too.

325
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,700
Your Highness.

326
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,570
The Empress Dowager has said that

327
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,630
these tonics are used to
nourish both you and the fetus.

328
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,630
So many?

329
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,250
It's like feeding a water buffalo.

330
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,180
Your Highness.

331
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,600
Taking these untouched tonics out of here

332
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,530
would be greatly disrespectful.

333
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,370
If I keep taking these tonics,

334
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,920
I'll either die from overeating

335
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,280
or from blood loss.

336
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,170
Is the Empress Dowager really
not trying to torment me?

337
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,550
Your Highness.

338
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,980
Someone from the Shoukang Palace
specially came here to relay the message

339
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,280
that you have to eat up all the tonics.

340
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,750
Got it.

341
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,320
Shoukang Palace?

342
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,200
This person came just in time.

343
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,530
How about trying my luck with Du Sanniang?

344
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,090
Actually,

345
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,800
I have an unreasonable request,

346
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,100
and I hope that you can
kindly approve it.

347
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,890
Let's drink as much as we can today.

348
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,010
I'll approve any requests from you.

349
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,150
Eunuch.

350
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,680
Hurry up!

351
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,000
Pour the wine.

352
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,260
Let me refill your cup.

353
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,630
Quite honest.

354
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,480
Good.

355
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,780
You can hold your liquor well.

356
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,210
You can drink more than I can.

357
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,240
I'm happy.

358
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,330
I'm complimenting you.

359
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,730
Why are you crying?

360
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,790
Your Grace.

361
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,850
I...

362
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,600
would like to request an imperial decree.

363
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,240
Yue.

364
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,580
Your Highness!

365
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,390
Yue!

366
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,880
Your Highness.

367
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Your Highness, I'm here.

368
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,200
What's wrong?

369
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,829
Go to the Six Palaces Bureau
and arrange a carriage for me.

370
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,569
I'm going to leave the palace.

371
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,240
You'll leave the palace?

372
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,829
Don't ask.

373
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,480
Okay, Your Highness.

374
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,270
Hurry up!

375
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,599
I didn't have a drink in vain.

376
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,200
They said you were pregnant,
and you're really stroking your belly?

377
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,940
It's because of the drinking, huh?

378
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,550
Get lost.

379
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,030
Did you find out about this long ago?

380
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,550
How could I possibly
know about your pregnancy?

381
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,280
I'm talking about your nephew.

382
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,550
He knew my identity from the beginning.

383
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,150
Were you also involved in it?

384
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,510
Heaven and Earth can be my witnesses!

385
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,070
I truly didn't know about this.

386
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,400
Although I had my doubts about

387
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,830
my nephew's intentions before,

388
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,030
he didn't discuss such matters with me.

389
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,550
Forget it.

390
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,170
The Empress Dowager granted
my request to leave the palace.

391
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,900
I'm going to leave the capital,

392
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,360
and I'll never come back.

393
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
How is that possible?

394
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,030
The Empress Dowager wouldn't allow
you to leave the palace.

395
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,290
What did you say to her?

396
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,140
When I'm pregnant, I just miss my home.

397
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,300
When I think of my home,
I think of my brother.

398
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,810
I want to go home
and pay my respects to him.

399
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,850
Paying respects?

400
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,500
Yes.

401
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,330
Okay.

402
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,490
Drink.

403
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,570
Drink it up and then pay respects to him.

404
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,130
Okay?

405
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,630
Cheers.

406
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,380
Yue Chi will pay respects to Yue Chi?

407
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,730
He's going to pay respects to his brother?

408
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,740
Alright.

409
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,450
He's running away, huh?

410
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,390
Then I'll play his game to the end.

411
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,150
So you know everything?

412
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,320
Yes.

413
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,000
I've verified it.

414
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,340
The news from the palace

415
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,790
is truly that the Commander is pregnant.

416
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,440
It must be a temporary measure.

417
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,240
But this is too absurd.

418
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,970
I'm afraid the Emperor
has other intentions.

419
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,890
Yunqing.

420
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,030
Where are you going?

421
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,540
Yue Chi still hasn't left the palace yet.

422
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,670
I'll go check on him.

423
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,220
Don't be hasty.

424
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,750
We've just managed to get you out.

425
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,350
Don't go back in there again.

426
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,310
How about I go and take a look?

427
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,280
Brother.

428
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,430
Your belly hasn't become big.

429
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,160
You're the ones with big bellies.

430
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,960
Let's go.

431
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
Go back to the mansion
and pack your things.

432
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,860
I'll take you away from
the imperial capital immediately.

433
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,160
Now?

434
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,160
Now.

435
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,030
Ling'er.

436
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,750
Is everything packed?

437
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,240
Brother, don't rush.

438
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,400
Let me think about

439
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,550
what else I might have forgotten to bring.

440
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,790
Bed sheets.

441
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,440
And then...

442
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,100
Commander.

443
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,520
Bad news.

444
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,550
His Majesty is coming with a large
procession of memorial services.

445
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,790
They're waving banners, ringing
bells and beating gongs.

446
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,830
What?

447
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,740
No need for formalities.

448
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,070
I heard that you

449
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,200
fell sick from missing your brother

450
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,160
and specially left the palace
to pay respects to him.

451
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm so sad about that.

452
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,170
Therefore,

453
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,280
I have decided

454
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,670
to personally arrange the memorial
service for Prince Anle

455
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,330
to comfort his soul in Heaven.

456
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,960
Oh, no.

457
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,870
Dog Huo is following me again.

458
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,020
What should I do now?

459
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,240
You two, be careful.

460
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,530
Hang them neatly.

461
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,590
Don't just stand there. Go over there.

462
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,320
Hang them up.

463
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,950
Be careful.

464
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,730
Slow down.

465
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,550
These things are very valuable.

466
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,320
Dear, are you not satisfied?

467
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,700
It's alright.

468
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,070
I've also hired a shaman.

469
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,240
A shaman?

470
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,630
Yes, a shaman.

471
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,120
That will surely make
your brother's afterlife lively.

472
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,320
Your Majesty, you're very thoughtful.

473
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,270
That's enough, my dear nephew.

474
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
That's enough.

475
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,160
I think it's quite appropriate.

476
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,530
How lively it is!

477
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,920
It's as if Prime Minister Yue
were still alive.

478
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,560
What do you think, Consort Yue?

479
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,610
Yes, indeed.

I've been the Emperor for two years

483
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,770
and been surrounded
by enemies on all sides.

484
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,690
I deeply feel that I can hardly bear
the burden with my power alone.

485

I need a companion

486
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,980
to fight alongside me

487
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,890
and protect the realm of Ning together.

488
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,890
It would be great if you were still alive.

489
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,870
I would certainly appoint you
as the Right Prime Minister

490
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,070
and ask you to be an official again.

Yue Chi is already dead.

493

Then you can

494
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,710
disguise yourself as a man

495
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,040
and be the Prime Minister

know that in the netherworld,

please

498
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,540
grant my sincere wish.

504
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,620
Come back and see me.

If it weren't for the Yue family,

506

Oh, no.

I wonder if you're
lonely in the netherworld.

What are you doing?

511
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,810
I'm going to dig up
the grave and open the coffin.

No, no, no.

515
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,000
Calm down!

For the sake of a dead person,
the current Emperor

535
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,480
has schemed meticulously

00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,010
and important part that
originally belonged to me.

561
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:34,000
I'll be trapped here
for the rest of my life.

562
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,380
But someone once told me that

563
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,450
for the vast world

564
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,970
and for the peace and
prosperity of all people,

565
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,680
I should bear the burden in court

566
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,590
and face numerous difficulties
without regrets.

567
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,110
Is it worth it?

568
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,300
Yes.

569
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,060
What's wrong?

570
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,090
Are you troubled?

571
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,580
Yes.

572
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,900
I'm troubled.

573
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,050
The way you are now

574
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,950
is nothing like when you used to shout that

575
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,150
you are my husband

576
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,500
and tell me to obey you.

577
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,860
At that time, the palace guards were
all surrounding us outside.

578
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,460
You were in imminent danger.

579
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,050
I was anxious.

580
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,220
About what?

581
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,280
You were afraid I'd be captured?

582
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,020
Yes.

583
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,830
I was afraid they would capture you.

584
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,960
I was afraid they would hurt you.

585
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,820
I was even more afraid that
they would kill you.

586
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,980
What if they had really captured me?

587
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,210
I would do whatever it takes to save you.

588
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,220
Yunqing.

589
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,450
To me,

590
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,150
your life is more important
than anything else.

591
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,540
In the future,

592
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,880
perhaps we can live an ordinary life.

593
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,190
We can leave the capital

594
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,220
and these places of conflicts.

595
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:13,970
You're wavering.

596
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,420
I'm not.

597
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,300
You still want to assist Huo Jingheng?

598
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,350
Have you forgotten that he shot
an arrow at you two years ago?

599
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,510
No, I haven't.

600
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,580
Back then, you stood in the way
of his ascension to the throne.

601
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,200
That was why he wanted to kill you.

602
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,600
Now he's trying to use you

603
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,030
to consolidate his imperial power.

604
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,940
If the same situation arises again,

605
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,870
he'll still do the same thing.

606
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,980
Alright, Yunqing.

607
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,460
I'm sorry.

608
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,550
Early tomorrow morning,

609
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,830
I will take you all away.

610
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,610
Yue Chi.

611
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,400
Don't let me down.

612
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,200
Leave Huo Jingheng.

613
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,610
Brother.

614
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,310
Do you already know everything?

615
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,390
If I had not known it,

616
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,980
would you keep it from me forever?

617
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,590
That's not what I meant.

618
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,190
You and Huo Jingheng conspired
to lure me into the palace.

619
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,880
Then you led me into
his trap step by step.

620
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,370
What situation do you want to put me in?

621
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,440
I...

622
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,070
Brother.

623
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,030
Don't be angry.

624
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,790
Brother.

625
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:09,250
Do you really not want to return to court?

626
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,740
When you established the
Rongying Academy with Huo Jingheng,

627
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,540
you were happy too, weren't you?

628
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,020
During that time,

629
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,810
there was always a smile on your face.

630
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,290
But I haven't seen a smile

631
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,450
like that on your face for so long.

632
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,320
That was the real you.

633
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,620
You cared about the world.

634
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,920
You were high-spirited and vigorous.

635
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,270
You've never changed.

636
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,030
What he wants is not only me

637
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,350
but also the Qilin Army behind me.

638
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,260
The imperial power is a fierce beast.

639
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,950
The Emperor's thoughts are unpredictable.

640
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,050
He might kill people
and destroy their spirits.

641
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,450
I can't take a risk with
all our lives again.

642
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,630
Actually,

643
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,500
Huo Jingheng might be a good Emperor.

644
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,890
If you like him so much,

645
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,060
you can stay.

646
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,560
I'll leave.

647
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,120
Brother.

648
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,720
Actually, I came here today

649
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,250
to return this to you.

651
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,530
[Records of Dog Huo's Daily Life]

652
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,260
If your brother were still alive today,

653
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,270
he would surely have
achieved great things.

654
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,380
For the vast world

655
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,290
and for the peace and
prosperity of all people...

656
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,630
I should bear the burden in court.

657
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,530
Have you forgotten that he shot
an arrow at you two years ago?

658
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,280
Back then, you stood in the way
of his ascension to the throne.

659
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,140
That was why he wanted to kill you.

660
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,200
In the future,

661
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,480
perhaps we can live an ordinary life.

662
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,720
We can leave these places of conflicts.

663
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:30,810
Don't worry.

664
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:35,469
I've allowed you to live
a peaceful life for two years.

665
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:38,389
Because I didn't want to
force you to do anything.

666
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,020
I just want to tell you that

667
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,969
as long as you want it,

668
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,070
the position of Ning State's
Prime Minister

669
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,260
will always be kept for Yue Chi.
