[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,710
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,720
Your Majesty,

4
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,980
I have an important matter to report.

5
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:34,910
As your uncle,

6
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,430
this old bag of bones

7
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,479
have been toiling outside for you,

8
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,870
with no lack of effort,

9
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,950
even if there's no great merit.

10
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,560
Uncle, you've worked hard.

11
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,590
Here,

12
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,560
help me share some of these.

13
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,450
Go away.

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,009
I've always been allergic to writing materials.

15
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,580
Indeed.

16
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,520
You just like to

17
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,080
boast and drink with officials,

18
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,480
gamble on cockfights and dog races.

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,070
I do that for Your Majesty's sake,

20
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,870
to implement a policy of appeasement with various vassal kings.

21
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,910
I've thrown up from drinking countless times!

22
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,430
Forgive my frankness,

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,220
but your efforts have been generally ineffective.

24
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,070
Ineffective?

25
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,960
Are you trying to undermine your own uncle?

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,620
Who allowed you to take Ling'er as your consort?

27
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,590
What?

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,100
Do you object to me taking Consort Yue?

29
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,630
I...

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
I remember now.

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,240
The Zheng family and the Yue family are old friends.

32
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,829
Uncle, are you so angry

33
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,030
because you have feelings for Consort Yue?

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,190
Oh my,

35
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,000
it's all my fault for being negligent.

36
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,400
Who would have thought that the esteemed Minister Du,

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,590
though incompetent in state affairs,

38
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,360
is quite skilled in matters of the heart?

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,560
If you don't like her,

40
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,030
let her leave the palace.

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
Who has captured your heart?

42
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,290
Who wants to leave the palace?

43
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,470
Mother.

44
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,960
Sister,

45
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,970
I was just joking with His Majesty.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,710
I'm Daning's number one golden bachelor.

47
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,240
In the prime of my youth,

48
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,680
I haven't thought about

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,079
settling down so early.

50
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,079
Is that so?

51
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,190
Then why do you repeatedly

52
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,030
sabotage my arranged marriages?

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,680
The arranged marriage issue is a misunderstanding.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,320
It was the minister's daughter who didn't like me.

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,360
Really?

56
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,360
Then why did that perfectly good girl

57
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,430
end up on Mount Wutai practicing asceticism because of you?

58
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,390
Your Majesty,

59
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,030
lend me your new bow.

60
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:56,980
Sister.

61
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,030
Calm down.

62
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,730
Calm down.

63
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,800
Who brought these dangerous things here?

64
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,500
It's life-threatening!

65
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,520
Who's talking about me?

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,870
Back then,

67
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,029
Father sent you to the Zheng family

68
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,640
to temper your unruly nature.

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,830
I didn't expect you to still be like this.

70
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,070
Now you think that as the Left Prime Minister,

71
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,900
running around all day,

72
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,370
I can't control you anymore?

73
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,680
You can.

74
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,270
Sister.

75
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,510
My sister

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,680
used me as a target

77
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,390
and even had me massage her legs for half an hour.

78
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,190
I really should be paid for this.

79
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Hurry up.

80
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,800
This is a reward from His Majesty for Consort Yue.

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,200
We can't afford to delay.

82
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,120
Since I'm already in the harem,

83
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,030
why don't...

84
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,530
Your Majesty,

85
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,470
Minister Du has gone towards Fengluan Palace.

86
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,550
The situation is at a stalemate.

87
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,100
I'll have to rely on my cunning uncle

88
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,450
to stir up some trouble.

89
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,680
It's been so many days.

90
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,930
Why haven't I seen any meat?

91
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,270
His Majesty has been coming to Fengluan Palace lately.

92
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,159
The kitchen has been

93
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,040
cooking according to His Majesty's taste.

94
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,390
His Majesty is a martial artist,

95
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,050
very disciplined in his diet,

96
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,800
preferring light and plain food.

97
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,240
He can be disciplined if he wants,

98
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,560
but why torment me?

99
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,780
Never mind.

100
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,390
Sit down and eat with me.

101
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,790
That won't be necessary.

102
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,930
I, a lowly servant, prefer heavy, meaty dishes.

103
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
The kitchen has made pork knuckles.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,360
I won't enjoy this feast with Your Highness.

105
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,620
I'll take my leave now.

106
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,670
Where's my pork knuckle?

107
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,790
Who stole my pork knuckle?

108
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,570
Huo Jingheng

109
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,070
is really despicable.

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,870
I didn't even die in the Former Ning.

111
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,670
How could I starve to death here?

112
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,040
It's stewed so tender.

113
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,000
She was like a little snowball when she's young.

114
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,000
It's only been a few years since we last met.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,800
How come she's become so robust?

116
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,330
Why is Du Tianzhao here?

117
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,430
You're Consort Yue?

118
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,650
Minister Du,

119
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,920
although your status is noble,

120
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,220
it's not appropriate to stare at me like this.

121
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,750
How come I remember

122
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,560
you used to be petite?

123
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,040
That was when I was a child.

124
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,800
Am I not allowed to grow?

125
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,600
How come I also remember

126
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,390
you didn't like greasy food?

127
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,720
Well, preferences

128
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,370
can change anytime.

129
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,750
The Yue and Zheng families are close.

130
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,750
It's a dark and windy night.

131
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,150
Why don't the two of us catch up?

132
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,260
Catch up?

133
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,200
I'll beat you to death.

134
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,630
What catching up?

135
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,360
You're wearing this graceful women's clothing.

136
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,390
Shouldn't you act more ladylike?

137
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,390
Yue Chi.

138
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,350
To hell with being ladylike!

139
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Tell me honestly,

140
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,480
why did you sneak into the palace?

141
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,920
If you don't confess,

142
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,040
I'll expose this matter.

143
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,560
A Prime Minister taking his sister's place in marriage,

144
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,000
cross-dressing as a woman

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,140
and deceiving His Majesty?

146
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,190
Even storytellers wouldn't dare to make up such a tale.

147
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,840
Shut up, will you?

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,600
I've confessed everything.

149
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,120
What are you up to?

150
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,140
Spill it already.

151
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,659
My nephew wants me to take on so many memorials.

152
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,860
How can I manage that?

153
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,920
Now, a bachelor Prime Minister

154
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,590
meets a fallen politician.

155
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,900
It's like a ruffian meeting a rich man;

156
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,960
a fat duck has walked in the door.

157
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,090
It would be a pity not to take a bite.

158
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,220
Put away that greedy look in your eyes.

159
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
I can tell

160
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,450
exactly what you're thinking.

161
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,400
Yue Chi,

162
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,830
no,

163
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,440
Prime Minister Yue,

164
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,120
let's make a deal.

165
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,640
It's a give and take.

166
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,660
Not only will I not expose you,

167
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,950
but I can also

168
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,000
take good care of Ling'er outside the palace for you.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,320
I guarantee she'll be treated like royalty,

170
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,049
and no one will dare to harm her.

171
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,039
And the conditions?

172
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,059
Your Highness.

173
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,390
This is so heavy.

174
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,740
What are all these treasures, Your Highness?

175
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,550
It's so heavy.

176
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,770
Is there any message?

177
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,080
The person who delivered it said,

178
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,240
once you open it,

179
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,380
you'll know everything.

180
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,280
You may go now.

181
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,440
Yes, Your Highness.

182
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,440
Memorials.

183
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,360
These are my conditions.

184
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,670
I won't reveal your identity,

185
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,780
and I'll take care of Ling'er for you.

186
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,630
However,

187
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,150
I am overwhelmed with official duties.

188
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,360
Taking care of Ling'er will inevitably be distracting.

189
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,990
I specially request you to serve as the acting Prime Minister,

190
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,440
to relieve my worries,

191
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,840
and to solve problems for Ning.

192
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,600
Du Tianzhao!

193
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,360
My Lord,

194
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,800
are you alright?

195
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,170
I'm fine.

196
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,120
I can guess who's cursing me.

197
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,560
Are my clothes wrinkled?

198
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,650
Check the back.

199
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,510
My Lord,

200
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,440
you've asked this

201
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,790
many times on the way here.

202
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,950
Your clothes aren't wrinkled.

203
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,670
What about my hair?

204
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,600
Is it still neat?

205
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,080
[Prince Anle's Mansion]

206
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,610
Alright.

207
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,850
You can go back now.

208
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,120
My Lady,

209
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,840
the roof leaked last night.

210
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,300
We need to repair the wall.

211
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,240
Then repair it.

212
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,490
But the money in the mansion

213
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,670
has all been taken by Commander to buy weapons.

214
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,730
We're out of money.

215
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,870
When will

216
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,320
Commander return?

217
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,740
I wish I knew.

218
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,110
These past few days,

219
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,380
I've been calculating accounts

220
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,730
and cutting costs.

221
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,030
I almost pawned my hairpins and tables.

222
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,810
But day after day,

223
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,150
money only goes out, not in.

224
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,870
How can this large mansion

225
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,850
and all its people sustain themselves?

226
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,680
Fortunately, there's the money His Majesty owed us before.

227
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,480
Originally,

228
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,320
I thought we could rob Peter to pay Paul.

229
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,110
But unexpectedly,

230
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,440
His Majesty is both

231
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,970
Peter and Paul.

232
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,840
His Majesty did give us money,

233
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,550
but he keeps

234
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,670
asking my brother for weapons every day.

235
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,200
Well,

236
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,240
that's another big hole in our finances.

237
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,490
Look at this,

238
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,110
it's leaking everywhere.

239
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,600
Don't worry, Ling'er.

240
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,630
Your help has arrived.

241
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,600
Come on.

242
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,750
Who are you?

243
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,340
Take a closer look.

244
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,710
Don't I look familiar?

245
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,700
Haven't you seen me when you were little?

246
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,790
Tianzhao.

247
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,510
Ling'er, stop.

248
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,030
I've already promised your brother

249
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,430
that I won't tell anyone.

250
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,910
Really?

251
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,080
The osmanthus pastries from Zuixiang Restaurant,

252
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,360
only sold once a month.

253
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,880
It's so hard to get these.

254
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,150
Put it down.

255
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,960
Try some.

256
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,150
Yue Chi is my buddy.

257
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,960
His business is my business.

258
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,400
Your brother told me,

259
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,840
you should stay at my residence for a while,

260
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,480
until he returns triumphantly from the palace.

261
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,600
To your residence?

262
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:15,910
Yes.

263
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,870
If you need anything,

264
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,150
just let me know.

265
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,810
I'll take care of it all.

266
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,150
Money is no issue?

267
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,360
Money is no issue.

268
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,980
Alright then.

269
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,830
Then I'll bring my whole family.

270
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
The whole family?

271
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,390
Come here.

272
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,950
My Lady.

273
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,340
It's alright.

274
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,350
Money is no issue now.

275
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,320
Someone's taking care of us.

276
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,630
That's great!

277
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,550
Thank you, Young Master.

278
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,550
Thank you, Young Master.

279
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,670
We'll have food to eat now.

280
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,070
We have things to eat now.

281
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,270
That's wonderful!

282
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,910
Thank you, Young Master.

283
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,750
Wei Zhang.

284
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,180
Why wasn't Minister Du present during the discussion?

285
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,090
I went to invite him,

286
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,120
but Minister Du said

287
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,510
he had matters to attend to at home.

288
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,210
He also said

289
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,930
that for matters concerning the vassal kings,

290
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,360
he wouldn't come.

291
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,840
And

292
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,200
that once he comes up with a solution,

293
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,130
he will submit a memorial himself.

294
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,240
Minister Du?

295
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,480
Trying to turn the tide?

296
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,350
Eunuch Gui,

297
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,510
how's the situation with Consort Yue?

298
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,490
Your Majesty,

299
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,490
she's making quite a stir.

300
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,320
Good.

301
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,800
Let's go take a look.

302
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,940
Consort Yue.

303
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,440
Consort Yue.

304
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,690
Your Highness.

305
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,280
Recently, I've been busy with state affairs

306
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,340
and haven't been staying overnight.

307
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,160
Why is Consort Yue acting this way?

308
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,190
Your Majesty,

309
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,630
Consort Yue has been staying in her chambers all day,

310
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,630
constantly reading.

311
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,870
As for what she's reading,

312
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,390
I don't know either.

313
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,870
You may go now.

314
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

316
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,910
It seems that my uncle

317
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
has finally done something useful.

318
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,200
Still having the habit

319
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,720
of leaving the mark.

321
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:38,960
Come and help me out.

Hurry up.

323
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:39,910
Come on.

324
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,840
Just put it here.

325
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,840
Let me do it.

326
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,150
Let me do it.

327
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,390
No need to arrange the dishes.

328
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,650
Just fill up the table.

329
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,630
Here.

330
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,270

331
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,000
have some water.

332
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,910
Don't choke.

333
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,320
Well,

334
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,390
there's not enough food

335
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,850
at Prince Anle's Mansion？

336
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,220
Well, Prince Anle's Mansion

337
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,750
isn't favored by the court,

338
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,750
and the regular salaries and rewards

339
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,000
are often withheld.

340
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,270
So naturally, I have to

341
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,720
eat less and work more,

342
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,730
sharing the hardships.

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,200

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,490
I haven't finished yet.

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,820

What was it from the North Market?

362
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,460
Why is this salary so...

363
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,480
Minister Du,

364
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,880
His Majesty summons you.

365
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,720
I have figured it out.

366
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,080
There's a lake

367
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,840
and baits,

368
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,160
but it's not enough.

369
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,200
What does that mean?

370
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,020
I don't understand.

371
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,970
Minister Du, recently

372
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,790

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,910
Serving Your Majesty,

376
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,440
how dare I not be attentive?

377
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,390
I've

378
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,270
just suppressed the vassal kings' request for more troops.

379
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,270
Recently, there have been many
memorials about vassal kings causing trouble.

380
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,500
Please, Minister Du,

381
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,100
handle these matters as well.

382
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,080
-That's a bit...
-Isn't your salary...

383
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,160
a bit low?

384
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,870
How much is left?

385
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,240
I'll handle them all,

386
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,600
Your Majesty.

387
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,670
[Memorial]
[Presented by Princess Pingyang]

388
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,750
Du Tianzhao, you black-hearted scoundrel!

389
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,390
When I get out of here,

390
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,190
I'll beat you until you're crawling on the ground!

391
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
His Majesty has arrived!

392
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,640
Greetings,

393
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,000
Your Majesty.

394
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,450
The weather has been cool lately.

395
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,530
Why are you all sweaty?

396
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,570
Your Majesty has been busy with official duties lately.

397
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,070
It's rare to see you,

398
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,400
so I'm excited.

399
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,650
What are you saying?

400
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,440
Is it because I haven't made you Empress

401
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,680
that you're angry?

402
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,680
Appointing Empress is a significant matter.

403
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,220
Your Majesty cannot make a decision at the moment.

404
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,480
It's understandable.

405
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,530
However,

406
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,150
I am certainly disappointed.

407
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,550
Your Majesty,

408
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,960
you must comfort me.

409
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,200
So,

410
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,310
may I ask for some other reward?

411
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,510
Consort Yue,

412
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,200
what reward do you want?

413
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:05,960
[Prince Anle's Mansion]

414
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,440
It's been a while.

415
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,070
Ling'er must miss me.

416
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,880
She must be so worried that she can't eat

417
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,110
or sleep well.

418
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,110
Your Highness,

419
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,200
the gatekeeper said

420
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,550
Prince Anle's Mansion has moved.

421
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,550
Moved?

422
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,490
The Qilin Army didn't

423
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,030
send any message.

424
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,040
I hope nothing bad has happened.

425
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,590
Your Highness.

426
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,560
Wait for me here.

427
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,540
I asked him to take care of them,

428
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,840
not to kidnap my entire family!

429
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,980
We can't eat both of them, can we?

430
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,550
My actual job

431
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,440
is a fortune teller.

432
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,400
Your palm reading...

433
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,480
Tianzhao,

434
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,260
you're much more generous than my brother.

435
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,860
You buy me two of everything.

436
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,750
Of course.

437
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,920
Yue Chi is just so stingy.

438
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,590
Which of these

439
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,720
two geese should I cook

440
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,150
and which should I play with?

441
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,770
Du Tianzhao!

442
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,240
All these twists and turns,

443
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,620
so you've been coveting my sister all along.

444
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,200
Dugu Xing,

445
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,000
investigate Du Tianzhao's actions in recent years.

446
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,550
See if he's been paying close attention to the Yue family,

447
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,880
especially to Ling'er.

448
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:53,950
Who's it?

449
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,590
Go.

450
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,490
Come with me.

451
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,270
Yunqing.

452
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,350
Yue Chi.

453
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,370
It's been two years.

454
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,920
Yes,

455
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,570
we haven't seen each other for two years.

456
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,660
Yunqing,

457
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,470
the Volunteer Army has broken through dozens of our defenses.

458
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,000
Our dynasty is now doomed.

459
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,310
If my brother leaves now,

460
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,440
he surely can't return.

461
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,750
Aren't you the Princess?

462
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,240
Don't you have a way?

463
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,720
Please, think of something, will you?

464
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,440
Ling'er,

465
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,350
this matter is beyond the control

466
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,240
of Yunqing or you and me.

467
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,550
By His Majesty's decree,

468
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,070
Princess Changping,

469
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,960
adorned with jade and conforming to propriety,

470
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,640
shall diligently

471
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,200
observe etiquette,

472
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,310
maintain dignity and tranquility,

473
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,400
be respectful, virtuous, gentle, and wise.

474
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,350
Hereby, she is betrothed to Prime Minister Yue Chi.

475
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,830
The relevant authorities are instructed

476
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,110
to select an auspicious date for the wedding.

477
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,640
By His Majesty's decree.

478
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,130
Prime Minister,

479
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,070
His Majesty has sent me

480
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,980
to convey a message to you.

481
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,830
Since the marriage has been bestowed,

482
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,360
the Yue family is now part of the royal family.

483
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,350
Your sister

484
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,310
shall enter the palace from today on

485
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,010
to accompany the princess

486
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,790
and await

487
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,750
Prime Minister Yue's

488
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,610
triumphant return.

489
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,130
Yue Chi,

490
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,120
this imperial decree

491
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,750
is not a shackle

492
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,030
but a promise.

493
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,200
If you win,

494
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,930
I'll be by your side to receive honors.

495
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,920
If you lose,

496
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,360
I'll go to battle in your place.

497
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,550
Whether it's Ling'er or anyone else,

498
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,250
as long as I remain a princess,

499
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,110
no one can touch them.

500
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,070
The army is ready to march.

501
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,430
Dayan Pass!

502
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,880
Huo Jingheng!

503
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,610
Prime Minister Yue!

504
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,590
As long as you're willing to surrender,

505
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,070
when I restore the glory of Ning,

506
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,160
I'll still appoint you as the Prime Minister.

507
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,320
I, Yue Chi, can only fight,

508
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,750
but never retreat!

509
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,620
Break through Dayan Pass!

510
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,080
March straight to the capital!

511
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:34,830
Brother.

512
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,680
I escaped.

513
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,450
Where's Yunqing?

514
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,440
When the capital fell,

515
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,490
the palace...

516
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,960
was plundered by chaotic soldiers.

517
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,110
To protect me, Yunqing made me leave

518
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,750
and she alone

519
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,240
fought off more than a dozen soldiers.

520
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,790
Brother!

521
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
What should we do?

522
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,060
Back then, only Ling'er escaped.

523
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,230
I was severely injured.

524
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,370
When I went to look for you again,

525
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,210
you had vanished without a trace.

526
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,810
I thought you had already...

527
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,720
Back then,

528
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,030
I was surrounded by more than a dozen soldiers.

529
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,310
I barely escaped with my life.

530
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,200
But then I heard

531
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,140
you had died at Dayan Pass.

532
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,920
For the past two years, I've been trying to avenge you,

533
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,620
but I've never succeeded.

534
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,310
I heard Ling'er was ordered to enter the palace,

535
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,570
so I came to rescue her.

536
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,490
But...

537
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,110
What's really going on here?

538
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,390
Your Majesty,

539
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,960
the female assassin who has tried to kill you several times

540
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,210
has come again.

541
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,550
Didn't I tell you to transport her to the border?

542
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,640
Why has she returned so soon?

543
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,490
She escaped when leaving the capital.

544
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,040
She's truly persistent.

545
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,510
But it's strange.

546
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,640
This time she didn't rush to Yongqian Palace.

547
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,440
After entering the palace, she disappeared.

548
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,460
The guards chasing her

549
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,520
seemed to see her heading northwest.

550
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Northwest?

551
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,930
Could she have escaped into Fengluan Palace?

552
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,200
Go to Fengluan Palace.

553
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Pass the order down.

554
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,170
Except for me,

555
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,700
no one is allowed to enter.

556
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,880
The assassin has already come,

557
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,950
and you're still concerned about Consort Yue?

558
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:29,960
No way.

559
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,960
As the Prime Minister,

560
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
how could you dress as a woman

561
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,030
and play along with that despicable traitor?

562
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,560
The former Prime Minister.

563
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,920
And it's just a temporary strategy.

564
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,390
That's still not acceptable.

565
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,420
How could you entrust Ling'er to him?

566
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,070
Come with me.

567
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,670
You can't stay in this place.

568
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,060
With my identity, where can I go after

569
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,790
leaving the capital?

570
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,790
Am I supposed to become a fugitive?

571
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,400
Then let's kill Huo Jingheng.

572
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,550
I can't do it alone.

573
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,880
But together, we can definitely do it.

574
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,580
Yunqing,

575
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,210
as a princess,

576
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,000
you have the pain of a fallen nation,

577
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,930
but what good would killing him do?

578
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,270
The world would fall into chaos,

579
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,440
and the people would suffer.

580
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,640
How could you and me remain unaffected?

581
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,590
So, are we just going to let

582
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,720
Huo Jingheng, that traitor, sit on the throne?

583
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,920
Then who do you want to sit on the throne?

584
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,000
My father, brothers,

585
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,200
uncles, elders,

586
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,440
at least someone from my Jiang family,

587
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,870
not him, Huo Jingheng.

588
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,000
So how do you plan to take it back?

589
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,880
How many lives are you willing to sacrifice?

590
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,560
How much blood and tears will be shed?

591
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,960
How many families will be destroyed?

592
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,560
How long will the chaos last?

593
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,110
You're a princess.

594
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,440
I may never be able

595
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,170
to feel from your perspective,

596
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,450
but I cannot agree with you,

597
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,880
nor will I help you.

598
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,400
Yue Chi.

599
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,840
I served in the previous dynasty

600
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,360
as a minister and an official.

601
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,350
It wasn't to gain power

602
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,750
and have people bow to me.

603
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,740
I'd rather be a dog in peaceful times

604
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,270
than a man in chaotic times.

605
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,140
If everyone in the world could live in peace,

606
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,900
I'd be content to be one among the common people.

607
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,600
It's not that I'm biased towards Huo Jingheng.

608
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,900
Since I entered the palace,

609
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,760
I've been observing him closely.

610
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,570
He's diligent in governance and benevolent,

611
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,920
wholeheartedly serving the people.

612
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,070
He is a wise ruler.

613
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,790
For me,

614
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,160
as long as it's a wise ruler

615
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,550
sitting on the dragon throne,

616
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,880
whether it's Huo Jingheng or anyone else,

617
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,050
it makes no difference.

618
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,690
Who's there?

619
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,720
It's me.

620
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,490
Your Majesty, please wait a moment.

621
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,790
Then I'll just let myself in.

622
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,980
Why aren't you coming out to greet me?

623
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,610
I'm busy, Your Majesty.

624
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,680
Do you need any help?

625
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,640
If you don't show yourself,

626
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,720
I'll come in.

627
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,810
Your Majesty, are you really in such a hurry?

628
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,030
Are you really alright?

629
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,420
Besides Your Majesty,

630
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,260
I'm afraid no one else would dare harm me.

631
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
I've prepared some new amusements,

632
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,660
and was just about to present them to you.

633
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,610
I knew you were hiding something good.

634
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,000
Are they there?

635
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,100
That assassin from the former dynasty

636
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,440
must be an old acquaintance of Yue Chi.

637
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
So afraid of being discovered by me.

638
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:02,990
My dear,

639
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,440
this is my memorial.

640
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,410
How did it end up with you?

641
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,790
[Reporting:
Lady Liu Jinfeng is gentle and virtuous in nature. I sincerely hope that Your Majesty will bestow upon her the title of Empress.]

642
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,520
Your Majesty must have forgotten,

643
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,040
you left it with me

644
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,400
a few days ago.

645
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,720
Is that so?

646
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,070
Yes.

647
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,710
I don't have the habit of folding page corners.

648
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,480
You've read it, haven't you?

649
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,440
Didn't you tell me yourself

650
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,740
that the harem should not interfere with politics?

651
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,070
Your Majesty's words

652
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,880
have frightened me.

653
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,110
My brother used to read memorials all the time.

654
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,790
I was just curious,

655
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,240
so I took a glance

656
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,350
while organizing them.

657
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,590
Your Majesty,

658
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,640
are you going to punish me for this?

659
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,240
Indeed.

660
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,400
Your Yue family

661
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,500
all have the ambition of soaring eagles.

662
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,680
Keeping you confined in this harem

663
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,170
must be frustrating for you.

664
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,350
Feel free to read it.

665
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,610
If it can alleviate your boredom,

666
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,390
that's fine.

667
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,570
It's a pity.

668
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,850
I'm afraid I'm too dull

669
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
to find anything interesting here.

670
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,000
However, I did find

671
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,750
a few weapons quite intriguing.

672
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,750
Your Majesty, why don't you

673
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,400
accompany me to take a look?

674
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,470
Certainly.

675
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,090
You...

676
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,510
Wait.

677
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,040
You could...

678
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,580
have sent the memorials with a servant.

679
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,820
Why did you have to make me come all the way here

680
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,910
and meet in such a secretive place?

681
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,510
There's no rush.

682
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,240
I need you to do me a favor first.

683
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,800
What is it?

684
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,410
This person...

685
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,440
looks familiar.

686
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,700
I seem to have seen her in your palace before.

687
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,400
Could she be...

688
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,020
the former princess, Jiang Yunqing,

689
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,200
who were once betrothed to you?

690
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:13,920
Come.

691
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,510
Get up.

692
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,880
Settle her in your mansion for me

693
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,280
and take good care of her.

694
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,750
I am the current Left Prime Minister.

695
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,610
You want me to take care of a former princess?

696
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,790
How preposterous.

697
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,750
If you put it that way,

698
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,550
you giving so many memorials

699
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,960
to a former Prime Minister

700
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,160
is preposterous too.

701
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,730
You can't say it like that.

702
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,440
Then how should I say it?

703
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,750
Didn't we agree?

704
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,110
You protect my mission for me,

705
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,550
and I protect yours for you.

706
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,210
We are each other's guardian.

707
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,510
A gentleman's agreement

708
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,510
must be kept.

709
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,680
Bah!

710
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,350
What am I supposed to keep?

711
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,510
I'm not going to be your guardian.

712
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,040
I'm not asking for trouble.

713
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm not discussing with you, Du Tianzhao.

714
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,590
All these years, you've had people

715
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,720
secretly investigating Ling'er at Yue Mansion.

716
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,050
I've recorded everything here in detail.

717
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,470
When you planned a chance encounter,

718
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,530
and when you created opportunities.

719
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,720
Those who know think you favor Ling'er,

720
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,550
but those who don't

721
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,030
might think you're a human trafficker.

722
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,400
I...

723
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,070
What?

724
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,790
If we can get along and honor

725
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,160
this guardianship,

726
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,170
that would be best.

727
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,510
Otherwise, if you want to make things difficult,

728
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,570
this booklet would

729
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
immediately be in Ling'er's hands,

730
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,210
so she could see your true face.

731
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,670
Take good care of her.

732
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,320
I haven't agreed yet.

733
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,000
Du Tianzhao!

734
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,030
You're treating me like a beast of burden.

735
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,830
It's so heavy.

736
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,810
You're the one who told me to bring it.

737
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,160
What kind of thing is this?

738
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,310
Yue Chi.

739
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
You're really

740
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,750
a life-taking demon.

741
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,720
It was Yue Chi who left you here.

742
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,030
What good does it do to beat me up?

743
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,400
Are you letting me go or not?

744
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,000
If you go out and are seen by others,

745
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,070
I won't be able to explain.

746
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,680
Alright.

747
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,590
Stop fighting.

748
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,240
Stop...

749
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,440
Ling'er, run quickly.

750
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,380
This woman is crazy.

751
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,430
Ling'er.

752
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,000
You can leave now.

753
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,110
Yunqing,

754
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,510
I've missed you so much.

755
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,790
Alright.

756
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,550
Alright.

757
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,920
Is it really you?

758
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,240
Silly girl,

759
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,300
why are you crying?

760
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,930
It's a happy thing for us to meet.

761
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,640
Alright.

762
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,550
Ling'er,

763
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,640
your brother is still in the palace.

764
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,440
I need to go rescue him.

765
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,090
Wait,

766
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,200
Yunqing,

767
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,590
we haven't seen each other for so long.

768
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,240
Look,

769
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,070
you've lost quite a bit of weight.

770
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,130
How about we eat something delicious

771
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,160
and get some sleep first?

772
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,310
At a time like this,

773
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,000
how could I possibly think about eating or sleeping?

774
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,550
Brother sent you back here.

775
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,930
He must have his plan.

776
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,360
What kind of plan is this?

777
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,270
You've never been able to tolerate injustice

778
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,870
and you hate all those rules.

779
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,630
Are you

780
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,270
really going to marry Huo Jingheng

781
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,600
and become his consort?

782
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,790
What on earth are you up to?
